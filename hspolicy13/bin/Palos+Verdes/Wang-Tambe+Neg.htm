And the Obama administration is not blamed for that policy, even though in many ways, of course, the Obama administration has followed the line. And so I think Obama is much more popular because of that.<br/>He’s also come down here on a couple of different occasions and those have been fairly successful trips.<br/>MARTIN: Let’s start with a country where there was a very difficult and tense relationship with the George W. Bush administration, and that is with Venezuela. President Hugo Chavez, he’s been a hero to the international left, a staunch opponent of kind of U.S. policy in the region. But he has had significant health problems in recent years, hasn’t been seen in public very much at all.<br/>What’s going on there? For people who haven’t kept up with this.<br/>FORERO: Well, the latest came just a couple of days ago when the vice president, Nicolas Maduro, said he was optimistic that Chavez could be back in Venezuela sooner rather than later. But like everything in Venezuela, you know, especially about Chavez’s health, there was very little detail.<br/>Let me recap and tell you what’s going on. Chavez has been battling cancer for about 19 months. And on December 11th, he surprised the country when he announced that he would undergo a fourth operation. In fact, it was that day when he underwent the operation to remove cancerous tissue from his pelvic region.<br/>The thing is, he hasn’t been heard from since. Keep in mind that <br/>AND<br/>his body it’s located, or whether he’s even coming back to Venezuela.<br/>MARTIN: So what’s been the U.S. posture toward all this? How has the U.S. reacted to all of this?<br/>FORERO: Well, the U.S. has been cautious in its comments. It’s coming out to say that they’d like to see a peaceful transition, meaning a peaceful constitutional transition if Chavez were not to come back to power or if he were permanently sidelined, either because of death or because he’s incapacitated.<br/>What’s really gotten the attention in the United States, and I guess in Latin America, is how the U.S. has over the past few weeks been working back channels to renew frayed relations that Washington has had with Caracas, with Venezuela, for years. These countries do not have ambassadors. In other words, there’s not an American ambassador in Venezuela.<br/>The DEA, which used to operate in Venezuela, is not permitted to do much of anything. And of course Chavez frequently rails against U.S. imperialism and warns that the U.S. is on the verge of invading. So the Obama administration is hoping that if there is a transition they’ll be able to have better relations with the next guy.<br/>MARTIN: Let’s move on to Cuba. And if you’re just joining us we’re speaking with NPR’s Juan Forero. We’re talking about the challenges facing President Obama in Latin America during his second term. Let’s talk about Cuba. One of the big news items from the region has been the Cuban government has finally relaxed its travel policy after many, many years.<br/>And so now there’s talk of a reciprocal move by the Obama administration. What can you tell us about that?<br/>FORERO: Well, I think there’s two policy shifts in Cuba that are super <br/>AND<br/>on any significant change such as ending its economic embargo of the island.<br/>And I don’t see that that is going to happen. I mean, the U.S. has long said that the Castros - that is Raul, the president, and his brother Fidel - have to be gone before the U.S. engages Cuba. And I think it’s important to note that American diplomats, I think, would love to see an end to the embargo.<br/>Because it’s very damaging to the U.S. It permits the Cubans to claim it’s being bullied by a superpower. And the embargo just hasn’t worked. You know, it hasn’t ousted the communist government there. But the Obama administration, I think, faces domestic issues here. First of all, most Americans simply don’t care about Cuba. And I think that the Cuban-American community, which does, has a leadership which continues to support a hard line against Cuba.<br/>And Obama knows full well that that community, the Cuban-American community, particularly in Florida, does vote.</p><h4 id="HEngagementwithCubasendsasignalofappeasement" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Engagement with Cuba sends a signal of appeasement</span></h4><p><strong>Rubin 11 -&nbsp;</strong>Labor Law Attorney and Washington Post Journalist (Jennifer, "Obama’s Cuba appeasement", Washington Post, 8/18, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/post/obamas-cuba-appeasement/2011/03/29/gIQAjuL2tL_blog.html-http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/post/obamas-cuba-appeasement/2011/03/29/gIQAjuL2tL_blog.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path excluded from retrieval by the project\%27s Exclusions properties.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/post/obamas-cuba-appeasement/2011/03/29/gIQAjuL2tL_blog.html-http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/post/obamas-cuba-appeasement/2011/03/29/gIQAjuL2tL_blog.html%27" tppabs="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/post/obamas-cuba-appeasement/2011/03/29/gIQAjuL2tL_blog.html-http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/post/obamas-cuba-appeasement/2011/03/29/gIQAjuL2tL_blog.html"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/post/obamas-cuba-appeasement/2011/03/29/gIQAjuL2tL_blog.html-http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/post/obamas-cuba-appeasement/2011/03/29/gIQAjuL2tL_blog.html</span></a></span> )<br/>The administration’s conduct is all the more galling given the behavior of the Castro regime. Our willingness to relax sanctions was not greeted with goodwill gestures, let alone systemic reforms. To the contrary, this was the setting for Gross’s imprisonment. So naturally the administration orders up more of the same.<br/>Throughout his tenure, President Obama has failed to comprehend the cost-benefit analysis that despotic regimes undertake.

Such narrowly applied sanctions more effectively punish the government officials and military leaders responsible for the human rights violations, limiting their ability to conduct overseas business and political dealings.<br/>Military: These sanctions specifically target the non-compliant government by imposing "arms embargoes or…terminating military assistance or training."~14~ &nbsp;The most prevalent issue of debate connected to the use of military sanctions is the impairment of the sanctioned country’s self-defense capability.~15~ &nbsp;South Africa and Iraq have both subjected to these sanctions.<br/>Diplomatic: Diplomatic sanctions focus specifically on "rulers of a sanctioned State: diplomats <br/>AND<br/>when these leaders wish to retain international standing for economic and nationalistic purposes.<br/>Cultural: Similar to diplomatic sanctions, cultural sanctions aim to disgrace a nation. &nbsp;The mildest manner of sanctioning, cultural sanctions involve banning "athletes…folk dancers, musicians, and other artists…~as well as~ restrictions…on educational and tourist travel."~18~ &nbsp;The ban on South African athletes from Olympic competition from 1970 to 1991 exemplifies a cultural sanction.~19~</dd></dl><h4 id="HThealsoviolateits2014-22Its22ispossessive" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>The also violate its—-"Its" is possessive</span></h4><p><strong>American Heritage 9</strong> ~The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition, updated 2009, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.thefreedictionary.com/its~~  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.thefreedictionary.com/its~~%27" tppabs="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/its~~"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.thefreedictionary.com/its~~</span></a></span><br/>its (ts)¶ adj.

"It doesn’t get easier to just put it off. Let’s do it now."<br/>Politically speaking, the president is right. The longer the immigration debate drags on, the lower the odds it will culminate in a bill on his desk.<br/>Here’s why.<br/>Every day that goes by is a day closer to the 2014 midterm elections. And the months leading up to Election Day are a time for lawmakers to campaign, raise money, and do everything they can to hold on to their jobs. It’s not a time for a contentious legislative debate that could complicate the fall campaign.<br/>That’s why history has shown that little gets done legislatively right before the election. Members are in their districts and states more and more often and less and less willing to take risks in Congress.<br/>And immigration reform is a risky proposition for many House Republicans. Despite national polls showing the public largely in favor of overhauling the nation’s laws, the calculus is often different back home. This is in large part why months after the Senate passed a sweeping bipartisan immigration bill, the House has yet to act.<br/>But that doesn’t mean it won’t. Republicans have already moved ahead on some piecemeal measures. And House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said Wednesday that he was "hopeful" something could get done by the end of the year.<br/>Coming off a fiscal battle that badly damaged the Republican brand, there is, arguably, more political incentive for Boehner to act on immigration than there has been in the past. Republicans need to repair their image. Helping pass broadly popular reforms is one way to do that.<br/>But there isn’t much time left on the legislative calendar this year, and it’s not clear whether Boehner will bring immigration to a vote before the year is up.<br/>But this much we do know: Every day that goes by makes it increasingly difficult to pass new immigration laws.</p><h4 id="HAgindustry2019scollapsingnow2014-immigration2019skey-1" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Ag industry’s collapsing now—-immigration’s key</span></h4><p>Alfonso Serrano 12, Bitter Harvest: U.S. Farmers Blame Billion-Dollar Losses on Immigration Laws, Time, 9-21-12, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://business.time.com/2012/09/21/bitter-harvest-u-s-farmers-blame-billion-dollar-losses-on-immigration-laws/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://business.time.com/2012/09/21/bitter-harvest-u-s-farmers-blame-billion-dollar-losses-on-immigration-laws/%27" tppabs="http://business.time.com/2012/09/21/bitter-harvest-u-s-farmers-blame-billion-dollar-losses-on-immigration-laws/"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://business.time.com/2012/09/21/bitter-harvest-u-s-farmers-blame-billion-dollar-losses-on-immigration-laws/</span></a></span><br/>The Broetjes and an increasing number of farmers across the country say that a complex <br/>AND<br/>up to 249 billion, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation.</p><h4 id="HExtinction-1" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Extinction</span></h4><p><strong>Lugar 2k</strong> Chairman of the Senator Foreign Relations Committee and Member/Former Chair of the Senate Agriculture Committee (Richard, a US Senator from Indiana, is Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and a member and former chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee.

And the Obama administration is not blamed for that policy, even though in many ways, of course, the Obama administration has followed the line. And so I think Obama is much more popular because of that.<br/>He’s also come down here on a couple of different occasions and those have been fairly successful trips.<br/>MARTIN: Let’s start with a country where there was a very difficult and tense relationship with the George W. Bush administration, and that is with Venezuela. President Hugo Chavez, he’s been a hero to the international left, a staunch opponent of kind of U.S. policy in the region. But he has had significant health problems in recent years, hasn’t been seen in public very much at all.<br/>What’s going on there? For people who haven’t kept up with this.<br/>FORERO: Well, the latest came just a couple of days ago when the vice president, Nicolas Maduro, said he was optimistic that Chavez could be back in Venezuela sooner rather than later. But like everything in Venezuela, you know, especially about Chavez’s health, there was very little detail.<br/>Let me recap and tell you what’s going on. Chavez has been battling cancer for about 19 months. And on December 11th, he surprised the country when he announced that he would undergo a fourth operation. In fact, it was that day when he underwent the operation to remove cancerous tissue from his pelvic region.<br/>The thing is, he hasn’t been heard from since. Keep in mind that <br/>AND<br/>his body it’s located, or whether he’s even coming back to Venezuela.<br/>MARTIN: So what’s been the U.S. posture toward all this? How has the U.S. reacted to all of this?<br/>FORERO: Well, the U.S. has been cautious in its comments. It’s coming out to say that they’d like to see a peaceful transition, meaning a peaceful constitutional transition if Chavez were not to come back to power or if he were permanently sidelined, either because of death or because he’s incapacitated.<br/>What’s really gotten the attention in the United States, and I guess in Latin America, is how the U.S. has over the past few weeks been working back channels to renew frayed relations that Washington has had with Caracas, with Venezuela, for years. These countries do not have ambassadors. In other words, there’s not an American ambassador in Venezuela.<br/>The DEA, which used to operate in Venezuela, is not permitted to do much of anything. And of course Chavez frequently rails against U.S. imperialism and warns that the U.S. is on the verge of invading. So the Obama administration is hoping that if there is a transition they’ll be able to have better relations with the next guy.<br/>MARTIN: Let’s move on to Cuba. And if you’re just joining us we’re speaking with NPR’s Juan Forero. We’re talking about the challenges facing President Obama in Latin America during his second term. Let’s talk about Cuba. One of the big news items from the region has been the Cuban government has finally relaxed its travel policy after many, many years.<br/>And so now there’s talk of a reciprocal move by the Obama administration. What can you tell us about that?<br/>FORERO: Well, I think there’s two policy shifts in Cuba that are super <br/>AND<br/>on any significant change such as ending its economic embargo of the island.<br/>And I don’t see that that is going to happen. I mean, the U.S. has long said that the Castros - that is Raul, the president, and his brother Fidel - have to be gone before the U.S. engages Cuba. And I think it’s important to note that American diplomats, I think, would love to see an end to the embargo.<br/>Because it’s very damaging to the U.S. It permits the Cubans to claim it’s being bullied by a superpower. And the embargo just hasn’t worked. You know, it hasn’t ousted the communist government there. But the Obama administration, I think, faces domestic issues here. First of all, most Americans simply don’t care about Cuba. And I think that the Cuban-American community, which does, has a leadership which continues to support a hard line against Cuba.<br/>And Obama knows full well that that community, the Cuban-American community, particularly in Florida, does vote.</p><h4 id="HEngagementwithCubasendsasignalofappeasement-1" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Engagement with Cuba sends a signal of appeasement</span></h4><p><strong>Rubin 11 -&nbsp;</strong>Labor Law Attorney and Washington Post Journalist (Jennifer, "Obama’s Cuba appeasement", Washington Post, 8/18, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/post/obamas-cuba-appeasement/2011/03/29/gIQAjuL2tL_blog.html-http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/post/obamas-cuba-appeasement/2011/03/29/gIQAjuL2tL_blog.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path excluded from retrieval by the project\%27s Exclusions properties.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/post/obamas-cuba-appeasement/2011/03/29/gIQAjuL2tL_blog.html-http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/post/obamas-cuba-appeasement/2011/03/29/gIQAjuL2tL_blog.html%27" tppabs="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/post/obamas-cuba-appeasement/2011/03/29/gIQAjuL2tL_blog.html-http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/post/obamas-cuba-appeasement/2011/03/29/gIQAjuL2tL_blog.html"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/post/obamas-cuba-appeasement/2011/03/29/gIQAjuL2tL_blog.html-http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/post/obamas-cuba-appeasement/2011/03/29/gIQAjuL2tL_blog.html</span></a></span> )<br/>The administration’s conduct is all the more galling given the behavior of the Castro regime.

The nonprofit Arms Control Association (ACA) observed that the most-recent IAEA report suggests "~I~t remains apparent that a nuclear-armed Iran is still not imminent nor is it inevitable." Iran was engaged in nuclear weapons development activities until it stopped in 2003, and as Cato’s Justin Logan observes, the IAEA’s own report shows there is no definitive evidence of Iran’s diversion of fissile material.<br/>When Pletka was called out for her "less than a year" prediction, she turned up her nose and snapped:<br/>Quibblers will suggest that there are important "ifs" in both these assessments. And yes, the key "if" is "if" Iran decides to build a bomb. So, I suppose when I said "less than a year away from having a nuclear weapon," I should have added, "if they want one." But… isn’t that the point? Do we want to leave this decision up to Khamenei?<br/>Confronted with ambiguous information, and forced to infer intentions, hawks evince the very same arrogance and overconfidence that helped open the door for Iranian influence in the region in the first place by toppling Saddam Hussein’s regime (Pletka advocated repeatedly for this leading up to the 2003 invasion). Pletka and others who years ago had the gall to argue that Iraq "will end when it ends" are today worthy of being ignored on Iran.</p></div></div></td><td>11/10/13</td></tr><tr><td style="width:100%; word-break:break-all; word-break:break-word;"><div><p><input onclick="saveEntry(5)" src="../../xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" tppabs="http://hspolicy13.debatecoaches.org/xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" style="float:right;" title="Save" type="image" value="Save"></input>

While a carrots-and-sticks approach may be appropriate within the economic arena, the use of trade sanction to achieve short-term political goals is discouraged.<br/>• The tactics of security engagement should reduce the risks posed by China’s rapid military expansion, its lack of transparency, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and transnational problems such as crime and illegal migration, by engaging in arms control negotiations, multilateral efforts, and a loosely-structured defensive military arrangement in Asia.8<br/>~To footnotes~<br/>8.

While a carrots-and-sticks approach may be appropriate within the economic arena, the use of trade sanction to achieve short-term political goals is discouraged.<br/>• The tactics of security engagement should reduce the risks posed by China’s rapid military expansion, its lack of transparency, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and transnational problems such as crime and illegal migration, by engaging in arms control negotiations, multilateral efforts, and a loosely-structured defensive military arrangement in Asia.8<br/>~To footnotes~<br/>8.

Such narrowly applied sanctions more effectively punish the government officials and military leaders responsible for the human rights violations, limiting their ability to conduct overseas business and political dealings.<br/>Military: These sanctions specifically target the non-compliant government by imposing "arms embargoes or…terminating military assistance or training."~14~ &nbsp;The most prevalent issue of debate connected to the use of military sanctions is the impairment of the sanctioned country’s self-defense capability.~15~ &nbsp;South Africa and Iraq have both subjected to these sanctions.<br/>Diplomatic: Diplomatic sanctions focus specifically on "rulers of a sanctioned State: diplomats <br/>AND<br/>when these leaders wish to retain international standing for economic and nationalistic purposes.<br/>Cultural: Similar to diplomatic sanctions, cultural sanctions aim to disgrace a nation. &nbsp;The mildest manner of sanctioning, cultural sanctions involve banning "athletes…folk dancers, musicians, and other artists…~as well as~ restrictions…on educational and tourist travel."~18~ &nbsp;The ban on South African athletes from Olympic competition from 1970 to 1991 exemplifies a cultural sanction.~19~</dd></dl><h4 id="HVoteNeg-1" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Vote Neg</span></h4><h4 id="HLimits2014theyopenthefloodgatestoallowtheremovalofnon-economicsanctionaffs2014-makesnegresearchimpossible-1" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Limits—they open the floodgates to allow the removal of non-economic sanction affs—-makes neg research impossible</span></h4><p>DA</p><h4 id="HObamaistakingahardlinestanceagainstCubanow2013theplanisperceivedasappeasement-2" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Obama is taking a hard line stance against Cuba now – the plan is perceived as appeasement</span></h4><p><strong>Forero</strong> 1/22<strong>/13</strong> - NPR’s South America correspondent and The Washington Post’s correspondent for Colombia and Venezuela (Juan, "Obama’s Unfinished Business: Latin America", January 22 of 2013, NPR, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.npr.org/2013/01/22/169980241/obamas-unfinished-business-latin-america)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.npr.org/2013/01/22/169980241/obamas-unfinished-business-latin-america)%27" tppabs="http://www.npr.org/2013/01/22/169980241/obamas-unfinished-business-latin-america)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.npr.org/2013/01/22/169980241/obamas-unfinished-business-latin-america)</span></a></span><br/>FORERO: Well, I think that there are a number of policies that are <br/>AND<br/>they do in Latin America but what they do outside of the region.<br/>And I think that has a lot to do with George Bush, too, because the Bush administration was very unpopular in the region for its foreign policy in the Middle East. And the Obama administration is not blamed for that policy, even though in many ways, of course, the Obama administration has followed the line. And so I think Obama is much more popular because of that.<br/>He’s also come down here on a couple of different occasions and those have been fairly successful trips.<br/>MARTIN: Let’s start with a country where there was a very difficult and tense relationship with the George W. Bush administration, and that is with Venezuela. President Hugo Chavez, he’s been a hero to the international left, a staunch opponent of kind of U.S. policy in the region. But he has had significant health problems in recent years, hasn’t been seen in public very much at all.<br/>What’s going on there? For people who haven’t kept up with this.<br/>FORERO: Well, the latest came just a couple of days ago when the vice president, Nicolas Maduro, said he was optimistic that Chavez could be back in Venezuela sooner rather than later. But like everything in Venezuela, you know, especially about Chavez’s health, there was very little detail.<br/>Let me recap and tell you what’s going on. Chavez has been battling cancer for about 19 months. And on December 11th, he surprised the country when he announced that he would undergo a fourth operation. In fact, it was that day when he underwent the operation to remove cancerous tissue from his pelvic region.<br/>The thing is, he hasn’t been heard from since. Keep in mind that <br/>AND<br/>his body it’s located, or whether he’s even coming back to Venezuela.<br/>MARTIN: So what’s been the U.S. posture toward all this? How has the U.S. reacted to all of this?<br/>FORERO: Well, the U.S. has been cautious in its comments. It’s coming out to say that they’d like to see a peaceful transition, meaning a peaceful constitutional transition if Chavez were not to come back to power or if he were permanently sidelined, either because of death or because he’s incapacitated.<br/>What’s really gotten the attention in the United States, and I guess in Latin America, is how the U.S. has over the past few weeks been working back channels to renew frayed relations that Washington has had with Caracas, with Venezuela, for years. These countries do not have ambassadors. In other words, there’s not an American ambassador in Venezuela.<br/>The DEA, which used to operate in Venezuela, is not permitted to do much of anything. And of course Chavez frequently rails against U.S. imperialism and warns that the U.S. is on the verge of invading. So the Obama administration is hoping that if there is a transition they’ll be able to have better relations with the next guy.<br/>MARTIN: Let’s move on to Cuba. And if you’re just joining us we’re speaking with NPR’s Juan Forero. We’re talking about the challenges facing President Obama in Latin America during his second term. Let’s talk about Cuba. One of the big news items from the region has been the Cuban government has finally relaxed its travel policy after many, many years.<br/>And so now there’s talk of a reciprocal move by the Obama administration. What can you tell us about that?<br/>FORERO: Well, I think there’s two policy shifts in Cuba that are super <br/>AND<br/>on any significant change such as ending its economic embargo of the island.<br/>And I don’t see that that is going to happen. I mean, the U.S. has long said that the Castros - that is Raul, the president, and his brother Fidel - have to be gone before the U.S. engages Cuba. And I think it’s important to note that American diplomats, I think, would love to see an end to the embargo.<br/>Because it’s very damaging to the U.S. It permits the Cubans to claim it’s being bullied by a superpower. And the embargo just hasn’t worked. You know, it hasn’t ousted the communist government there. But the Obama administration, I think, faces domestic issues here. First of all, most Americans simply don’t care about Cuba. And I think that the Cuban-American community, which does, has a leadership which continues to support a hard line against Cuba.<br/>And Obama knows full well that that community, the Cuban-American community, particularly in Florida, does vote.</p><h4 id="HEngagementwithCubasendsasignalofappeasement-2" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Engagement with Cuba sends a signal of appeasement</span></h4><p><strong>Rubin 11 -&nbsp;</strong>Labor Law Attorney and Washington Post Journalist (Jennifer, "Obama’s Cuba appeasement", Washington Post, 8/18, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/post/obamas-cuba-appeasement/2011/03/29/gIQAjuL2tL_blog.html-http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/post/obamas-cuba-appeasement/2011/03/29/gIQAjuL2tL_blog.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path excluded from retrieval by the project\%27s Exclusions properties.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/post/obamas-cuba-appeasement/2011/03/29/gIQAjuL2tL_blog.html-http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/post/obamas-cuba-appeasement/2011/03/29/gIQAjuL2tL_blog.html%27" tppabs="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/post/obamas-cuba-appeasement/2011/03/29/gIQAjuL2tL_blog.html-http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/post/obamas-cuba-appeasement/2011/03/29/gIQAjuL2tL_blog.html"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/post/obamas-cuba-appeasement/2011/03/29/gIQAjuL2tL_blog.html-http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/post/obamas-cuba-appeasement/2011/03/29/gIQAjuL2tL_blog.html</span></a></span> )<br/>The administration’s conduct is all the more galling given the behavior of the Castro regime.

Such narrowly applied sanctions more effectively punish the government officials and military leaders responsible for the human rights violations, limiting their ability to conduct overseas business and political dealings.<br/>Military: These sanctions specifically target the non-compliant government by imposing "arms embargoes or…terminating military assistance or training."~14~ &nbsp;The most prevalent issue of debate connected to the use of military sanctions is the impairment of the sanctioned country’s self-defense capability.~15~ &nbsp;South Africa and Iraq have both subjected to these sanctions.<br/>Diplomatic: Diplomatic sanctions focus specifically on "rulers of a sanctioned State: diplomats <br/>AND<br/>when these leaders wish to retain international standing for economic and nationalistic purposes.<br/>Cultural: Similar to diplomatic sanctions, cultural sanctions aim to disgrace a nation. &nbsp;The mildest manner of sanctioning, cultural sanctions involve banning "athletes…folk dancers, musicians, and other artists…~as well as~ restrictions…on educational and tourist travel."~18~ &nbsp;The ban on South African athletes from Olympic competition from 1970 to 1991 exemplifies a cultural sanction.~19~</dd></dl><h2 id="HK-6" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>K</span></h2><h4 id="HCubaisahumanrightsviolator2014-shunningviolatorsshouldbeatthecenterofyourdecisioncalculus" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Cuba is a human rights violator—-shunning violators should be at the center of your decision calculus</span></h4><p><strong>Beversluis, 89</strong> (Eric H.

And the Obama administration is not blamed for that policy, even though in many ways, of course, the Obama administration has followed the line. And so I think Obama is much more popular because of that.<br/>He’s also come down here on a couple of different occasions and those have been fairly successful trips.<br/>MARTIN: Let’s start with a country where there was a very difficult and tense relationship with the George W. Bush administration, and that is with Venezuela. President Hugo Chavez, he’s been a hero to the international left, a staunch opponent of kind of U.S. policy in the region. But he has had significant health problems in recent years, hasn’t been seen in public very much at all.<br/>What’s going on there? For people who haven’t kept up with this.<br/>FORERO: Well, the latest came just a couple of days ago when the vice president, Nicolas Maduro, said he was optimistic that Chavez could be back in Venezuela sooner rather than later. But like everything in Venezuela, you know, especially about Chavez’s health, there was very little detail.<br/>Let me recap and tell you what’s going on. Chavez has been battling cancer for about 19 months. And on December 11th, he surprised the country when he announced that he would undergo a fourth operation. In fact, it was that day when he underwent the operation to remove cancerous tissue from his pelvic region.<br/>The thing is, he hasn’t been heard from since. Keep in mind that <br/>AND<br/>his body it’s located, or whether he’s even coming back to Venezuela.<br/>MARTIN: So what’s been the U.S. posture toward all this? How has the U.S. reacted to all of this?<br/>FORERO: Well, the U.S. has been cautious in its comments. It’s coming out to say that they’d like to see a peaceful transition, meaning a peaceful constitutional transition if Chavez were not to come back to power or if he were permanently sidelined, either because of death or because he’s incapacitated.<br/>What’s really gotten the attention in the United States, and I guess in Latin America, is how the U.S. has over the past few weeks been working back channels to renew frayed relations that Washington has had with Caracas, with Venezuela, for years. These countries do not have ambassadors. In other words, there’s not an American ambassador in Venezuela.<br/>The DEA, which used to operate in Venezuela, is not permitted to do much of anything. And of course Chavez frequently rails against U.S. imperialism and warns that the U.S. is on the verge of invading. So the Obama administration is hoping that if there is a transition they’ll be able to have better relations with the next guy.<br/>MARTIN: Let’s move on to Cuba. And if you’re just joining us we’re speaking with NPR’s Juan Forero. We’re talking about the challenges facing President Obama in Latin America during his second term. Let’s talk about Cuba. One of the big news items from the region has been the Cuban government has finally relaxed its travel policy after many, many years.<br/>And so now there’s talk of a reciprocal move by the Obama administration. What can you tell us about that?<br/>FORERO: Well, I think there’s two policy shifts in Cuba that are super <br/>AND<br/>on any significant change such as ending its economic embargo of the island.<br/>And I don’t see that that is going to happen. I mean, the U.S. has long said that the Castros - that is Raul, the president, and his brother Fidel - have to be gone before the U.S. engages Cuba. And I think it’s important to note that American diplomats, I think, would love to see an end to the embargo.<br/>Because it’s very damaging to the U.S. It permits the Cubans to claim it’s being bullied by a superpower. And the embargo just hasn’t worked. You know, it hasn’t ousted the communist government there. But the Obama administration, I think, faces domestic issues here. First of all, most Americans simply don’t care about Cuba. And I think that the Cuban-American community, which does, has a leadership which continues to support a hard line against Cuba.<br/>And Obama knows full well that that community, the Cuban-American community, particularly in Florida, does vote.</p><h4 id="HEngagementwithCubasendsasignalofappeasement-3" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Engagement with Cuba sends a signal of appeasement</span></h4><p><strong>Rubin 11 -&nbsp;</strong>Labor Law Attorney and Washington Post Journalist (Jennifer, "Obama’s Cuba appeasement", Washington Post, 8/18, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/post/obamas-cuba-appeasement/2011/03/29/gIQAjuL2tL_blog.html-http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/post/obamas-cuba-appeasement/2011/03/29/gIQAjuL2tL_blog.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path excluded from retrieval by the project\%27s Exclusions properties.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/post/obamas-cuba-appeasement/2011/03/29/gIQAjuL2tL_blog.html-http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/post/obamas-cuba-appeasement/2011/03/29/gIQAjuL2tL_blog.html%27" tppabs="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/post/obamas-cuba-appeasement/2011/03/29/gIQAjuL2tL_blog.html-http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/post/obamas-cuba-appeasement/2011/03/29/gIQAjuL2tL_blog.html"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/post/obamas-cuba-appeasement/2011/03/29/gIQAjuL2tL_blog.html-http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/post/obamas-cuba-appeasement/2011/03/29/gIQAjuL2tL_blog.html</span></a></span> )<br/>The administration’s conduct is all the more galling given the behavior of the Castro regime.

While a carrots-and-sticks approach may be appropriate within the economic arena, the use of trade sanction to achieve short-term political goals is discouraged.<br/>• The tactics of security engagement should reduce the risks posed by China’s rapid military expansion, its lack of transparency, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and transnational problems such as crime and illegal migration, by engaging in arms control negotiations, multilateral efforts, and a loosely-structured defensive military arrangement in Asia.8<br/>~To footnotes~<br/>8.

Such narrowly applied sanctions more effectively punish the government officials and military leaders responsible for the human rights violations, limiting their ability to conduct overseas business and political dealings.<br/>Military: These sanctions specifically target the non-compliant government by imposing "arms embargoes or…terminating military assistance or training."~14~ &nbsp;The most prevalent issue of debate connected to the use of military sanctions is the impairment of the sanctioned country’s self-defense capability.~15~ &nbsp;South Africa and Iraq have both subjected to these sanctions.<br/>Diplomatic: Diplomatic sanctions focus specifically on "rulers of a sanctioned State: diplomats <br/>AND<br/>when these leaders wish to retain international standing for economic and nationalistic purposes.<br/>Cultural: Similar to diplomatic sanctions, cultural sanctions aim to disgrace a nation. &nbsp;The mildest manner of sanctioning, cultural sanctions involve banning "athletes…folk dancers, musicians, and other artists…~as well as~ restrictions…on educational and tourist travel."~18~ &nbsp;The ban on South African athletes from Olympic competition from 1970 to 1991 exemplifies a cultural sanction.~19~</dd></dl><h4 id="HVoteNeg-2" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Vote Neg</span></h4><h4 id="HLimits2014theyopenthefloodgatestoallowtheremovalofnon-economicsanctionaffs2014-makesnegresearchimpossible-2" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Limits—they open the floodgates to allow the removal of non-economic sanction affs—-makes neg research impossible</span></h4><p>DA</p><h4 id="HNEXTOFF2014CASTRODA" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>NEXT OFF—CASTRO DA</span></h4><p><strong>====The plan creates a political whirlwind that kills reforms and causes instability====</strong><br/><strong>Hernandez, 2012</strong> (Cuba’s Leading Social Sciences professor and researcher at the University of Havana and the High Institute of International Relations; Director of U.S. studies at the Centro de Estudios sobre America; and a Senior Research Fellow at the Instituto cubano de Investigacion Cultural "Juan Marinello" in Havana.

Well, consider the alternatives. For starters, we might decide to skip statistical forecasting altogether and just target our interventions at cases identified by expert judgment as likely onsets.

The importance and value of such study is widely recognized.<br/>Much of the most significant communication of our lives is conducted in the form of debates. These may take place in intrapersonal communications, in which we weigh the pros and cons of an important decision in our own minds, or they may take place in interpersonal communications, in which we listen to arguments intended to influence our decision or participate in exchanges to influence the decisions of others.<br/>Our success or failure in life is largely determined by our ability to make wise <br/>AND<br/>customer for out product, or a vote for our favored political candidate.</strong></p><h4 id="HEffectivedeliberationisthelynchpinofsolvingallexistentialglobalproblems" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Effective deliberation is the lynchpin of solving all existential global problems</span></h4><p>Christian O. <strong>Lundberg 10</strong> Professor of Communications @ University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, "Tradition of Debate in North Carolina" in Navigating Opportunity: Policy Debate in the 21st Century By Allan D.

While a carrots-and-sticks approach may be appropriate within the economic arena, the use of trade sanction to achieve short-term political goals is discouraged.<br/>• The tactics of security engagement should reduce the risks posed by China’s rapid military expansion, its lack of transparency, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and transnational problems such as crime and illegal migration, by engaging in arms control negotiations, multilateral efforts, and a loosely-structured defensive military arrangement in Asia.8<br/>~To footnotes~<br/>8.

While a carrots-and-sticks approach may be appropriate within the economic arena, the use of trade sanction to achieve short-term political goals is discouraged.<br/>• The tactics of security engagement should reduce the risks posed by China’s rapid military expansion, its lack of transparency, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and transnational problems such as crime and illegal migration, by engaging in arms control negotiations, multilateral efforts, and a loosely-structured defensive military arrangement in Asia.8<br/>~To footnotes~<br/>8.
