Interpretation – The instruments of engagement must be exclusively economic<br/>Jakstaite, 10 - Doctoral Candidate Vytautas Magnus University Faculty of Political Sciences and Diplomacy (Lithuania) (Gerda, “CONTAINMENT AND ENGAGEMENT AS MIDDLE-RANGE THEORIES” BALTIC JOURNAL OF LAW and POLITICS VOLUME 3, NUMBER 2 (2010), DOI: 10.2478/v10076-010-0015-7)</p><p>The approach to engagement as economic engagement focuses exclusively on economic instruments of foreign policy with the main national interest being security. Economic engagement is a policy of the conscious development of economic relations with the adversary in order to change the target state?s behaviour and to improve bilateral relations.94<br/>Economic engagement is academically wielded in several respects. It recommends that the state engage the target country in the international community (with the there existing rules) and modify the target state?s run foreign policy, thus preventing the emergence of a potential enemy.95 Thus, this strategy aims to ensure safety in particular, whereas economic benefit is not a priority objective.<br/>Objectives of economic engagement indicate that this form of engagement is designed for relations with <br/>AND<br/>exclude the possibility to realize economic engagement in relations with democratic regimes.97<br/>Proponents of economic engagement believe that the economy may be one factor which leads to closer relations and cooperation (a more peaceful foreign policy and the expected pledge to cooperate) between hostile countries – closer economic ties will develop the target state?s dependence on economic engagement implementing state for which such relations will also be cost-effective (i.e., the mutual dependence).<br/>However, there are some important conditions for the economic factor in engagement to be <br/>AND<br/>that would help them maintain a dominant position in their own country.98<br/>Proponents of economic engagement do not provide a detailed description of the means of this <br/>AND<br/>are developed depending on changes in the target state?s behaviour.99<br/>Unconditional economic engagement is more moderate form of engagement. Engagement applying state while developing economic relations with an adversary hopes that the resulting economic dependence over time will change foreign policy course of the target state and reduce the likelihood of armed conflict. Theorists assume that economic dependence may act as a restriction of target state?s foreign policy or as transforming factor that changes target state?s foreign policy objectives.100<br/>Thus, economic engagement focuses solely on economic measures (although theorists do not give a more detailed description), on strategically important actors of the international arena and includes other types of engagement, such as the conditional-unconditional economic engagement.</p><p>B.

In this scenario, public life will be at the mercy of market forces, as the extracted profits benefit the few, writes Rajesh Makwana.<br/>The thrust of international policy behind the phenomenon of economic globalization is neoliberal in nature. Being hugely profitable to corporations and the wealthy elite, neoliberal polices are propagated through the IMF, World Bank and WTO. Neoliberalism favours the free-market as the most efficient method of global resource allocation. Consequently it favours large-scale, corporate commerce and the privatization of resources.<br/>There has been much international attention recently on neoliberalism. Its ideologies have been rejected by influential countries in Latin America and its moral basis is now widely questioned. Recent protests against the WTO, IMF and World Bank were essentially protests against the neoliberal policies that these organizations implement, particularly in low-income countries.<br/>The neoliberal experiment has failed to combat extreme poverty, has exacerbated global inequality, and is hampering international aid and development efforts. This article presents an overview of neoliberalism and its effect on low income countries.<br/>Introduction <br/>After the Second World War, corporate enterprises helped to create a wealthy class in society which enjoyed excessive political influence on their government in the US and Europe. Neoliberalism surfaced as a reaction by these wealthy elites to counteract post-war policies that favoured the working class and strengthened the welfare state.<br/>Neoliberal policies advocate market forces and commercial activity as the most efficient methods for producing <br/>AND<br/>corporations and affluent countries to secure their financial advantage within the world economy.<br/>The policies were most ardently enforced in the US and Europe in the1980s during the <br/>AND<br/>, economic and political leverage, they continue to further their neoliberal objectives.<br/>There is a consensus between the financial elite, neoclassical economists and the political classes <br/>AND<br/>the most likely means of reducing poverty and inequality in the poorest regions.<br/>There is a huge discrepancy between the measurable result of economic globalization and its proposed <br/>AND<br/>economic growth per capita grew to over 8 between 1980 and 2000.)<br/>Neoliberalism has also been unable to address growing levels of global inequality. Over the last 25 years, the income inequalities have increased dramatically, both within and between countries. Between 1980 and 1998, the income of richest 10 as share of poorest 10 became 19 more unequal; and the income of richest 1 as share of poorest 1 became 77 more unequal (again, not including China).<br/>The shortcomings of neoliberal policy are also apparent in the well documented economic disasters suffered <br/>AND<br/>and medical expertise throughout the region and with other countries around the world.<br/>The dramatic economic and social improvement seen in these countries has not stopped them from <br/>AND<br/>economic dominance has been and continues to be the USA’s main economic objective.<br/>According to Maria Páez Victor:<br/>“Since 1846 the United States has carried out no fewer than 50 military invasions and destabilizing operations involving 12 different Latin American countries. Yet, none of these countries has ever had the capacity to threaten US security in any significant way. &nbsp;The US intervened because of perceived threats to its economic control and expansion. &nbsp;For this reason it has also supported some of the region’s most vicious dictators such as Batista, Somoza, Trujillo, and Pinochet.”<br/>As a result of corporate and US influence, the key international bodies that developing <br/>AND<br/>project contracts. They all gain considerably from the neo-liberal model.<br/>So influential are corporations at this time that many of the worst violators of human rights have even entered a Global Compact with the United Nations, the world’s foremost humanitarian body. Due to this international convergence of economic ideology, it is no coincidence that the assumptions that are key to increasing corporate welfare and growth are the same assumptions that form the thrust of mainstream global economic policy.<br/>However, there are huge differences between the neoliberal dogma that the US and EU <br/>AND<br/>to achieving development by imposing an ideology that suits their own economic needs.<br/>The US and EU also provide huge subsidies to many sectors of industry. These devastate small industries in developing countries, particularly farmers who cannot compete with the price of subsidized goods in international markets. Despite their neoliberal rhetoric, most ‘capitalist’ countries have increased their levels of state intervention over the past 25 years, and the size of their government has increased. The requirement is to ‘do as I say, not as I do’.<br/>Given the tiny proportion of individuals that benefit from neoliberal policies, the chasm between what is good for the economy and what serves the public good is growing fast. Decisions to follow these policies are out of the hands of the public, and the national sovereignty of many developing countries continues to be violated, preventing them from prioritizing urgent national needs.<br/>Below we examine the false assumptions of neoliberal policies and their effect on the global economy.<br/>Economic Growth<br/>Economic growth, as measured in GDP, is the yardstick of economic globalization which <br/>AND<br/>economic growth is the only way to prosper a country and reduce poverty.<br/>Logically, however, a model for continual financial growth is unsustainable. Corporations have to go to extraordinary lengths in order to reflect endless growth in their accounting books. As a result, finite resources are wasted and the environment is dangerously neglected. The equivalent of two football fields of natural forest is cleared each second by profit hungry corporations.<br/>Economic growth is also used by the World Bank and government economists to measure progress <br/>AND<br/>growth have proved impossible due to the inadequacy of the statistical measures employed.<br/>The mandate for economic growth is the perfect platform for corporations which, as a result, have grown rapidly in their economic activity, profitability and political influence. Yet this very model is also the cause of the growing inequalities seen across the globe. The privatization of resources and profits by the few at the expense of the many, and the inability of the poorest people to afford market prices, are both likely causes.<br/>Free Trade<br/>Free trade is the foremost demand of neoliberal globalization. In its current form, <br/>AND<br/>pushing smaller producers in developing countries out of the market and impeding development.<br/>With this self interest driving globalization, economically powerful nations have created a global trading regime with which they can determine the terms of trade.<br/>The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) between the US, Canada, and Mexico is an example of free-market fundamentalism that gives corporations legal rights at the expense of national sovereignty. Since its implementation it has caused job loss, undermined labour rights, privatized essential services, increased inequality and caused environmental destruction.<br/>In Europe only 5 of EU citizens work in agriculture, generating just 1.6 of EU GDP compared to more than 50 of citizens in developing countries. However, the European Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) provides subsidies to EU farmers to the tune of £30 billion, 80 of which goes to only 20 of farmers to guarantee their viability, however inefficient this may be.<br/>The General Agreement on Trade and Services (GATS) was agreed at the World <br/>AND<br/>services are instead granted to corporate interests through the GATS and TRIPS framework.<br/>These examples represent modern free trade which is clearly biased in its approach. It fosters corporate globalization at the expense of local economies, the environment, democracy and human rights. The primary beneficiaries of international trade are large, multinational corporations who fiercely lobby at all levels of national and global governance to further the free trade agenda.<br/>Liberalization<br/>The World Bank, IMF and WTO have been the main portals for implementing the <br/>AND<br/>this group, and market liberalization has been another of their key policies.<br/>According to neoliberal ideology, in order for international trade to be ‘free’ all markets should be open to competition, and market forces should determine economic relationships. But the overall result of a completely open and free market is of course market dominance by corporate heavy-weights. The playing field is not even; all developing countries are at a great financial and economic disadvantage and simply cannot compete.<br/>Liberalization, through Structural Adjustment Programs, forces poorer countries to open their markets to <br/>AND<br/>economic risk; hence the EU and US heavily protect their own markets.<br/>A liberalized global market provides corporations with new resources to capitalize and new markets to <br/>AND<br/>They would then be in a better position to compete in international markets.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>2nd off <br/>Vote neg to interrogate neoliberal economic engagement with latin America from the starting point of knowledge production. <br/>Walsh, Estudios Culturales Latinoamericanos de la Universidad Andina Simón Bolívar, 2012<br/>(Catherine, “The Politics of Naming”, Cultural Studies, 26.1, Project Muse)<br/> <br/>Cultural Studies, in our project, is constructed and understood as more than a <br/>AND<br/>Studies is only one of our options, and part of the politics of&nbsp;</p><p>3rd off-<br/>The United States Federal Government should establish a Transboundary Hydrocarbons Agreement with Mexico.&nbsp;</p><p>Hydrocarbons agreement solves the aff<br/>Boman, 13 oil and natural gas expert (Karen Boman, 4/22/13, “Bill Seeks to Allow Drilling Near US Mexico Maritime Border”, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.rigzone.com/news/article.asp?a_id=125950)//EM  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.rigzone.com/news/article.asp?a_id=125950)//EM%27" tppabs="http://www.rigzone.com/news/article.asp?a_id=125950)//EM"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.rigzone.com/news/article.asp?a_id=125950)//EM</span></a></span><br/>Bill Seeks to Allow Drilling Near US Mexico Maritime Border A legislative hearing will take <br/>AND<br/>Middle East crudes to make up for Mexico production shortfalls, Lugar added.<br/> <br/>4th off<br/>Immigration will pass – GOP is willing to compromise, but political capital is key<br/>Martosko 10-17 (David, U.S. political editor, Immigration battle threatens to dwarf debt-limit fight as many Republicans fear power of 17 MILLION newly legalized loyal Democrats, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2464112/Immigration-battle-threatens-dwarf-debt-limit-fight-Republicans-fear-power-17-MILLION-newly-legalized-loyal-Democrats.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2464112/Immigration-battle-threatens-dwarf-debt-limit-fight-Republicans-fear-power-17-MILLION-newly-legalized-loyal-Democrats.html#ixzz2hziJbwnt)%27" tppabs="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2464112/Immigration-battle-threatens-dwarf-debt-limit-fight-Republicans-fear-power-17-MILLION-newly-legalized-loyal-Democrats.html#ixzz2hziJbwnt)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2464112/Immigration-battle-threatens-dwarf-debt-limit-fight-Republicans-fear-power-17-MILLION-newly-legalized-loyal-Democrats.html#ixzz2hziJbwnt)</span></a></span></p><p>Republicans' new worst fear isn't defaulting on America's debts.

If we both want the <br/>AND<br/>rage. Thus ethics identifies the rights of individuals when their interests conflict.<br/>But how can a case for shunning be made on this view of morality? <br/>AND<br/>, on what grounds might it be a duty to impose such sanctions?<br/>We find the answer when we note that there is another "level" of <br/>AND<br/>rights of others with one's actions but also to support that moral order.<br/>Consider that the moral order itself contributes significantly to people's rights being respected. It <br/>AND<br/>it indirectly affects people's rights. And this is where shunning fits in.<br/>Certain types of behavior constitute a direct attack on the moral order. When the <br/>AND<br/>three conditions which turn immoral behavior into an attack on the moral order.<br/>An immoral action is flagrant if it is "extremely or deliberately conspicuous; notorious<br/>AND<br/>reaffirms the legitimacy of that moral order. How does shunning do this?<br/>First, by refusing publicly to have to do with such a person one announces support for the moral order and backs up the announcement with action. This action reinforces the commitment to the moral order both of the shunner and of the other members of the community. (Secretary of State Shultz in effect made this argument in his call for international sanctions on Libya in the early days of 1986.)<br/>Further, shunning may have a moral effect on the shunned person, even if the direct impact is not adequate to change the immoral behavior. If the shunned person thinks of herself as part of the moral community, shunning may well make clear to her that she is, in fact, removing herself from that community by the behavior in question. Thus shunning may achieve by moral suasion what cannot be achieved by "force."<br/>Finally, shunning may be a form of punishment, of moral sanction, whose appropriateness depends not on whether it will change the person's behavior, but on whether he deserves the punishment for violating the moral order. Punishment then can be viewed as a way of maintaining the moral order, of "purifying the community" after it has been made "unclean," as ancient communities might have put it.<br/>Yet not every immoral action requires that we shun. As noted above, we <br/>AND<br/>on the moral order itself through flagrant, willful, and persistent wrongdoing. <br/>We can also now see why failure to shun can under certain circumstances suggest complicity. But it is not that we have a duty to shun because failure to do so suggests complicity. Rather, because we have an obligation to shun in certain circumstances, when we fail to do so others may interpret our failure as tacit complicity in the willful, persistent, and flagrant immorality.</p><p>ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE</p><p>No extinction<br/>The Economist, 09 (The Economist, January 15, 2009, “Second life: Biologists debate the scale of extinction in the world’s tropical forests,” <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.economist.com/node/12926042  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.economist.com/node/12926042%27" tppabs="http://www.economist.com/node/12926042"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.economist.com/node/12926042</span></a></span>, Hensel)<br/>A RARE piece of good news from the world of conservation: the global extinction <br/>AND<br/>Once forest cover does start increasing, the rate of extinction should dwindle.</p><p>Deforestation is a massive alt cause<br/>Cardillo, 06 (Marcel, Division of Biology, Imperial College London, 2006, “Disappearing forests and biodiversity loss: which areas should we protect?,” International Forestry Review Volume 8, Issue 2, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.tempoandmode.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/int-forestry-review-june-2006-cardillo.pdf  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.tempoandmode.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/int-forestry-review-june-2006-cardillo.pdf%27" tppabs="http://www.tempoandmode.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/int-forestry-review-june-2006-cardillo.pdf"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.tempoandmode.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/int-forestry-review-june-2006-cardillo.pdf</span></a></span>, Hensel)<br/>The destruction of forests and other habitats is the single most important cause of biodiversity <br/>AND<br/>&nbsp;under different modelled scenarios of forest loss to 2020 (Grelle 2005).&nbsp;</p><p>FRAMING<br/>This moral tunnel vision is complicit with the evil they criticize-prefer util<br/>Issac 2, professor of political science at Indiana University, 2002 &nbsp;(Jeffrey, Dissent, Spring, ebsco)<br/>As writers such as Niccolo Machiavelli, Max Weber, Reinhold Niebuhr, and Hannah <br/>AND<br/>not true believers.

Just of the last few days, however, the odds of such a bill even reaching the president’s desk have dropped unexpectedly.<br/>The Hill, for example, reported yesterday that House Republicans “are moving away from a proposal to adopt new Iran sanctions.” House Democrats who were otherwise sympathetic to the idea became “irked” by GOP political tactics “and the idea appears to have been at least temporarily shelved.”<br/>In the Senate, meanwhile, BuzzFeed reports that Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), a co-sponsor of the legislation, has “proposed the idea of scheduling a vote on Iran sanctions six months from now, after the interim nuclear agreement has run its course, instead of voting on sanctions right now.”<br/>In other words, lawmakers could at least wait to see if the talks bear fruit before sabotaging them in advance. Corker’s idea isn’t ideal – it would reportedly lock in the Senate for a vote on July 21, exactly six months after the current deal is implemented, regardless of the status of the diplomacy – but in the larger context it suggests even sanctions supporters are starting to see value in waiting.<br/>Indeed, an unnamed senator who supports the sanctions bill told Greg Sargent this week that opponents have the momentum. The senator added, “At the moment, there’s no rush to put the bill on the floor. I’m not aware of any deadline in anyone’s head.”<br/>Keep in mind, the sanctions legislation was introduced in the Senate on Dec. 19 with a bipartisan group of 26 sponsors. Over the course of just three weeks, that total more than doubled to 59 sponsors. But the last addition was eight days ago – and no other senators have signed on since.<br/>What changed the direction of the debate? To be sure, White House pressure has made a difference, reinforced by President Obama’s direct lobbying to Democratic senators this week. I also talked to a Senate staffer yesterday who said public pressure has also increased, with more voters contacting the Hill with phone calls and emails, voicing opposition to the bill.<br/>Plan costs capital<br/>Snow and Gianakis 8 (Dr. Douglas and Dr. Gerasimos, both from Sawyer Business School at Suffolk University, THE IMPLEMENTATION AND MANAGEMENT OF MUNICIPAL STABILIZATION FUNDS IN MASSACHUSETTS: A RESEARCH NOTE, p. 6-7)</p><p>In October of 2006, we administered the survey to all 351 municipal finance directors <br/>AND<br/>of the more relevant responses to survey questions are summarized in the appendix.</p><p>That means sanctions proponents will be able to override a veto<br/>Kampeas, 1/24/14 – Washington, D.C. bureau chief of the Jewish Telegraphic Agency (Ron, Heritage Florida Jewish News, “Iran sanctions have majority backing in Senate, but not enough to override veto”<br/><span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.heritagefl.com/story/2014/01/24/news/iran-sanctions-have-majority-backing-in-senate-but-not-enough-to-override-veto/2115.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.heritagefl.com/story/2014/01/24/news/iran-sanctions-have-majority-backing-in-senate-but-not-enough-to-override-veto/2115.html%27" tppabs="http://www.heritagefl.com/story/2014/01/24/news/iran-sanctions-have-majority-backing-in-senate-but-not-enough-to-override-veto/2115.html"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.heritagefl.com/story/2014/01/24/news/iran-sanctions-have-majority-backing-in-senate-but-not-enough-to-override-veto/2115.html</span></a></span></p><p>WASHINGTON (JTA)—More than half the United States Senate has signed on to a bill that would intensify sanctions against Iran. But in a sign of the so-far successful effort by the White House to keep the bill from reaching a veto-busting 67 supporters, only 16 Democrats are on board.<br/>The number of senators cosponsoring the bill, introduced by Sens. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.) and Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), reached 58 this week, up from just 33 before the Christmas holiday break.<br/>Notably only one of the 25 who signed up in recent days—Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.)—is a Democrat, a sign of intense White House lobbying among Democrats to oppose the bill.<br/>Backers of the bill say it would strengthen the U.S. hand at the negotiations. But President Obama has said he would veto the bill because it could upend talks now underway between the major powers and Iran aimed at keeping the Islamic Republic from obtaining a nuclear bomb. A similar bill passed this summer by the U.S. House of Representatives had a veto-proof majority.<br/>On Thursday, the White House said backers of the bill should be upfront about the fact that it puts the United States on the path to war.<br/>“If certain members of Congress want the United States to take military action, <br/>AND<br/>have to choose between military options or allowing Iran’s nuclear program to proceed.”<br/>A number of pro-Israel groups, led by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, are leading a full-court press for the bill’s passage, with prominent Jewish leaders in a number of states making calls and writing letters to holdouts.

But it is the legislation's commitment to support an Israeli preventive strike against Iranian nuclear facilities that almost ensures the U.S. and Iran will come to blows. As Section 2b, part 5 of the draft mandates:<br/>If the Government of Israel is compelled to take military action in legitimate self-defense against Iran's nuclear weapon program, the United States Government should stand with Israel and provide, in accordance with the law of the United States and the constitutional responsibility of Congress to authorize the use of military force, diplomatic, military, and economic support to the Government of Israel in its defense of its territory, people, and existence.<br/>Now, the legislation being pushed by Senators Mark Kirk (R-IL), <br/>AND<br/>March told a Christians United for Israel (CUFI) conference in July:<br/>"If nothing changes in Iran, come September, October, I will present a resolution that will authorize the use of military force to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear bomb."<br/>Graham would have plenty of company from the hardest of hard liners in his party. In August 2012, Romney national security adviser and pardoned Iran-Contra architect Elliott Abrams called for a war authorization in the pages of the Weekly Standard. And just two weeks ago, Norman Podhoretz used his Wall Street Journal op-ed to urge the Obama administration to "strike Iran now" to avoid "the nuclear war sure to come."<br/>But at the end of the day, the lack of an explicit AUMF in the Nuclear Weapon Free Iran Act doesn't mean its supporters aren't giving Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu de facto carte blanche to hit Iranian nuclear facilities. The ensuing Iranian retaliation against to Israeli and American interests would almost certainly trigger the commitment of U.S. forces anyway.<br/>Even if the Israelis alone launched a strike against Iran's atomic sites, Tehran will almost certainly hit back against U.S. targets in the Straits of Hormuz, in the region, possibly in Europe and even potentially in the American homeland.

The anticipated blowback?<br/>Serious costs to U.S. interests would also be felt over the longer term, we believe, with problematic consequences for global and regional stability, including economic stability. A dynamic of escalation, action, and counteraction could produce serious unintended consequences that would significantly increase all of these costs and lead, potentially, to all-out regional war.</p><p>An Israeli strike fails, but triggers World War 3, collapses heg and the global economy<br/>Reuveny, 10 – professor in the School of Public and Environmental Affairs at Indiana University (Rafael, “Unilateral strike could trigger World War III, global depression” Gazette Xtra, &nbsp;8/7, - See more at: <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://gazettextra.com/news/2010/aug/07/con-unilateral-strike-could-trigger-world-war-iii-/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://gazettextra.com/news/2010/aug/07/con-unilateral-strike-could-trigger-world-war-iii-/#sthash.ec4zqu8o.dpuf)%27" tppabs="http://gazettextra.com/news/2010/aug/07/con-unilateral-strike-could-trigger-world-war-iii-/#sthash.ec4zqu8o.dpuf)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://gazettextra.com/news/2010/aug/07/con-unilateral-strike-could-trigger-world-war-iii-/#sthash.ec4zqu8o.dpuf)</span></a></span></p><p>A unilateral Israeli strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities would likely have dire consequences, including a regional war, global economic collapse and a major power clash.<br/>For an Israeli campaign to succeed, it must be quick and decisive. This requires an attack that would be so overwhelming that Iran would not dare to respond in full force.<br/>Such an outcome is extremely unlikely since the locations of some of Iran’s nuclear facilities are not fully known and known facilities are buried deep underground.<br/>All of these widely spread facilities are shielded by elaborate air defense systems constructed not only by the Iranians but also the Chinese and, likely, the Russians as well.<br/>By now, Iran has also built redundant command and control systems and nuclear facilities, developed early warning systems, acquired ballistic and cruise missiles and upgraded and enlarged its armed forces.<br/>Because Iran is well-prepared, a single, conventional Israeli strike—or even numerous strikes—could not destroy all of its capabilities, giving Iran time to respond.<br/>Unlike Iraq, whose nuclear program Israel destroyed in 1981, Iran has a second-strike capability comprised of a coalition of Iranian, Syrian, Lebanese, Hezbollah, Hamas, and, perhaps, Turkish forces. Internal pressure might compel Jordan, Egypt and the Palestinian Authority to join the assault, turning a bad situation into a regional war.<br/>During the 1973 Arab-Israeli War, at the apex of its power, Israel was saved from defeat by President Nixon’s shipment of weapons and planes. Today, Israel’s numerical inferiority is greater, and it faces more determined and better-equipped opponents. After years of futilely fighting Palestinian irregular armies, Israel has lost some of its perceived superiority—bolstering its enemies’ resolve.<br/>Despite Israel’s touted defense systems, Iranian coalition missiles, armed forces, and terrorist attacks would likely wreak havoc on its enemy, leading to a prolonged tit-for-tat.<br/>In the absence of massive U.S. assistance, Israel’s military resources may quickly dwindle, forcing it to use its alleged nuclear weapons, as it had reportedly almost done in 1973.<br/>An Israeli nuclear attack would likely destroy most of Iran’s capabilities, but a crippled Iran and its coalition could still attack neighboring oil facilities, unleash global terrorism, plant mines in the Persian Gulf and impair maritime trade in the Mediterranean, Red Sea and Indian Ocean.<br/>Middle Eastern oil shipments would likely slow to a trickle as production declines due to the war and insurance companies decide to drop their risky Middle Eastern clients. Iran and Venezuela would likely stop selling oil to the United States and Europe.<br/>From there, things could deteriorate as they did in the 1930s. The world economy would head into a tailspin; international acrimony would rise; and Iraqi and Afghani citizens might fully turn on the United States, immediately requiring the deployment of more American troops.<br/>Russia, China, Venezuela, and maybe Brazil and Turkey—all of which essentially support Iran—could be tempted to form an alliance and openly challenge the U.S. hegemony.<br/>Russia and China might rearm their injured Iranian protege overnight, just as Nixon rearmed Israel, and threaten to intervene, just as the U.S.S.R. threatened to join Egypt and Syria in 1973. President Obama’s response would likely put U.S. forces on nuclear alert, replaying Nixon’s nightmarish scenario.<br/>Iran may well feel duty-bound to respond to a unilateral attack by its Israeli archenemy, but it knows that it could not take on the United States head-to-head. In contrast, if the United States leads the attack, Iran’s response would likely be muted.<br/>If Iran chooses to absorb an American-led strike, its allies would likely protest and send weapons but would probably not risk using force.<br/>While no one has a crystal ball, leaders should be risk-averse when choosing war as a foreign policy tool. If attacking Iran is deemed necessary, Israel must wait for an American green light. A unilateral Israeli strike could ultimately spark World War III.</p><p>3<br/>The dream of security produces apocalypse– constructions of existential risk produce the annihilation they are meant to escape<br/>Pever Coviello, Prof. of English @ Bowdoin, 2k Queer Frontiers, p. 39-40<br/>Perhaps.

This legislation, in expressing the sense of the Congress, would require payment in full plus interest on claims of U.S. Nationals for properties seized by the Castro regime. As you know, I have introduced similar legislation-Senate Joint Resolution 87-in the Senate.<br/>With Cuban troops involved in military adventures in Africa, not to mention heightened Cuban activity in Central America and the Caribbean, it is highly unlikely that the U.S. could justifiably discuss normalizing relations with the Castro regime at this time.<br/>And certainly the weight of moral imperatives leaves no room for future debate on the <br/>AND<br/>of U.S. property expropriated by all other Communist governments combined.<br/>These seizures have not only affected the larger corporate property owners, but have hurt many small owners as well. For although corporate holdings doubtlessly constitute the largest dollar amount, 66 percent of the 7,740 claims certified by the Claims Commission are for $10,000 or less; 87 percent are for $50,000 or less.<br/>However unlikely a change of heart on the part of the Castro regime seems at this point, should Cuba decide to reverse its adventuristic policies, release its political prisoners and press for genuine reconciliations, I believe it is important that this Government be on record in support of full payment plus interest on these certified claims.<br/>All too often it seems as if U.S. negotiators sit down at the bargaining table after having modified their bargaining position to such an extent as to leave us with no leverage at all. If the economic embargo against the Cuban regime is lifted without satisfactory arrangements in place for the settlement of certified U.S. claims, I fear there is little chance these claims will ever be paid.<br/>That is why I am convinced that Congress must impress on the President our strong conviction that these just, certified claims must be settled as a central prior issue to substantive discussions.
