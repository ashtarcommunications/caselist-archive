The category that opened the door to all Americans to visit Cuba was people to people, in which the only prerequisite was willingness and ability to pay for a group trip with a “full-time schedule of educational exchange activities...that will result in meaningful interaction between the traveler and individuals in Cuba.” The devil was in the details, how would such amorphous language be implemented. What subjective and political screen would be in place behind the very closed doors of the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), still led by a Bush appointee. In the first year OFAC approved about one in three license applications, and imposed a one year time limit. It seemingly had more enthusiasm for trips that looked more like high end educational tourism, and less for those focused on substantive interaction. <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.thehavananote.com/2012/01/one_year_semi_opening_cuba_travel  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.thehavananote.com/2012/01/one_year_semi_opening_cuba_travel%27" tppabs="http://www.thehavananote.com/2012/01/one_year_semi_opening_cuba_travel"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.thehavananote.com/2012/01/one_year_semi_opening_cuba_travel</span></a></span> But even that was too much for the hard liners in Congress. They hid behind the claim that the small increment of Americans in a universe of 2.5 million tourists significantly subsidized the regime they hate. In reality their accurate fear was that the more people travel to Cuba the more challenge will arise to the US diplomatic and economic embargo. The ultras tried to slip in a rider to the comprehensive appropriations bill in December that would gut travel, but the President faced them down.</p></div></div></td><td>12/11/13</td></tr><tr><td style="width:100%; word-break:break-all; word-break:break-word;"><div><p><input onclick="saveEntry(18)" src="../../xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" tppabs="http://hspolicy13.debatecoaches.org/xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" style="float:right;" title="Save" type="image" value="Save"></input>

Xenophobic outbursts, civil wars, collapsing currencies, protectionism, international conflicts, and street riots were only some of the dire consequences expected by the experts. <br/>It didn’t happen. Although the crash did cause severe economic damage and widespread human suffering, and though the world did change in important ways for the worse — the International Monetary Fund, for example, estimates that the global economy’s new and permanent trajectory is a 10 percent lower rate of GDP growth than before the crisis — the scary predictions for the most part failed to materialize. <br/>Sadly, the same experts who failed to foresee the economic crisis were also blindsided by the speed of the recovery. More than a year into the crisis, we now know just how off they were. From telling us about the imminent collapse of the international financial system to prophecies of a 10-year recession, here are six of the most common predictions about the crisis that have been proven wrong: <br/>The international financial system will collapse. It didn’t. As Lehman Brothers, Bear <br/>AND<br/>Depression, and comparing the situation to the demise of the Soviet Union. <br/>The natural corollary of such doomsday scenarios was the possibility that depositors would lose access <br/>AND<br/>use or that it can suddenly crash out of existence has largely dissipated. <br/>The economic crisis will last for at least two years and maybe even a decade<br/>AND<br/>more effective than anyone had expected in shortening the life of the recession. <br/>The U.S. dollar will crash. It didn’t. Instead, the <br/>AND<br/>and facilitate the correction of the global ’imbalances’ that helped cause the crisis.and#34; <br/>Protectionism will surge. It didn’t. Trade flows did drop dramatically in late 2008 <br/>AND<br/>trade barriers cannot be ruled out. But it has not happened yet. <br/>The crisis in rich countries will drag down developing ones. It didn’t. As <br/>AND<br/>emerging economies could and#34;decoupleand#34; from the advanced ones was widely mocked. <br/>But decouple they did. Some emerging economies relied on their domestic markets, others <br/>AND<br/>— but many others managed to avoid the fate of the advanced economies. <br/>Violent political turmoil will become more common. It didn’t. Electorates did punish governments <br/>AND<br/>and bring in governments that are extreme. These things are pretty predictable.and#34; <br/>No, it turns out: They aren’t.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HAirpowerfails2013doesn2019tdeterconflict" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Airpower fails – doesn’t deter conflict</span></h4><p>Clodfelter 6 (Mark, professor of military history at the National War College, and#34;The limits of air power: the American bombing of North Vietnamand#34;, Google Books, Page xi, AV)</p><p>Unfortunately, precision bombing may not be the answer.

U.S. immigration reform that includes addressing the question of the mobility of high-skilled workers could strengthen the U.S. hand in encouraging these changes. On the energy front, the administration should work to allow the export of natural gas to India, while explaining that this is not the major solution that many in India seem to think it is.

Public and foreign policy programs have increasingly used simulations as training and teaching tools. Policy initiatives, whether foreign or domestic, generate strategic dynamics; players respond to how other players have changed the game environment. Consequently, playing games can help students develop expertise regarding how to manage strategic dynamics, as well as more specific skills such as crisis negotiation. <br/>At the same time, foreign and public policy schools have become attractive to serious <br/>AND<br/>a grand strategy competition involving a large number of major foreign policy programs. <br/>Accordingly, the universe of potential policy simulations and “war games” is virtually <br/>AND<br/>of course -- sketching out an Israeli bombing campaign against Iranian nuclear facilities. <br/>As in many other fields, the Internet has transformed the development process of policy-oriented simulations. Widely available information and modern information technology makes it possible to bring together subject matter experts with designers, and crowdsourcing helps demonstrate and correct problems and flaws with the simulation. Indeed, the Wikistrat model is built directly on the idea that smart crowdsourcing can produce better policy analysis than reliance on relatively isolated expert opinion. <br/>Patterson School simulations focus on the teaching and training aspects of gaming rather than on <br/>AND<br/>hopefully modeling the conditions under which policy professionals produce recommendations and make decisions. <br/>This is not to say that nothing can be learned from the course of the <br/>AND<br/>, and the Mexican police consistently undercutting the efforts of the Mexican army. <br/>Our simulation highlighted the problems of bureaucratic competition, indistinct boundaries of responsibility, and <br/>AND<br/>they undoubtedly will face situations where policymakers demand options, sleep be damned. <br/>Increasingly realistic simulations involving larger and larger numbers of interested, well-informed players will help structure public policy decision-making for the foreseeable future. Someday, strong performance in such simulations, as well as the ability to craft useful games, may even prove a pathway to success in a public policy career.</p><p>T<br/>Interpretation.
