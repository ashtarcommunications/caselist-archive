This knowledge production is not just useless neutrality but rather the lynchpin of the Western intellectual subject – any argument the affirmative makes about how the subaltern would totally be on-board with their project relies on the same logic that reinforces conceptions of the inferior Other – a ballot for the affirmative is giving the subaltern a cordectomy <br/>Spivak 88 (Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, Indian literary theorist, philosopher and University Professor at Columbia University, Marxism and the Interpretation of Culture, 1988 “Can the Subaltern Speak?,” Online, azp) <br/>SOME OF THE … can the subaltern speak? . . . <br/> <br/>Isn’t it off-putting that the affirmative merely expresses solidarity with the oppressed yet does little to nothing to actually relieve their oppression? – What do you think their endless theories, intellectual movements, and speech acts actually DO to resolve anything? – the answer is absolutely nothing – they aren’t subversive, nor radical, nor even that interesting – their speech act is an intellectual façade designed to avoid having to resolve oppression<br/>Raskin 99 (Marcus Raskin, Professor of Public Policy at George Washington University, 1999, Transnational Law and Contemporary Problems, Fall)<br/>As I have noted, … few, demands recognition.&nbsp;</p><p>The subaltern is subsequently reduced to a fungible object, a passive object for the consumption of the debate community – the affirmative absorbs the power of alterity only to toss its carcass back into the dust<br/>Chow 93 (Rey, Andrew W.

In the wake of the US defeat in Vietnam and the subsequent stagnation of growth, the US turned to the neoimperialism of neoliberal reforms abroad and at home to secure its future.

The AFF imagines their presentation of mass violence as a prophylactic against the resurgence of violence, all the while ignoring that liberal moralism is the motor of modern warfare. The AFF calls on victims to bargain for a more just world by exposing their wounds for academic consumption. This act of politicization relies on a racist victim economy in which black, brown and red bodies are vampirically drained of life, made to dance for an infinitely deferred freedom, all while academics extract jouissance and &nbsp;advancement from their objectified identities. <br/>Berlant 1998<br/>/Lauren, George M.

These reforms served to roll back all protections in place which insulated the poor from the worst excesses of capitalism.

If the child is "the prop of the secular theology on which our social reality rests: the secular theology that shapes at once the meaning of our collective narratives and our collective narratives of meaning" (Edelman 12), the animal, as the prop for the performance of "dehumanization", is the locus of the permanent denial of all meaning and relevance. If, as Edelman writes, queerness names the side of those not „fighting for the children?, the side outside the consensus by which all politics confirms the absolute value of reproductive futurism. ~…~ ~while~ queerness, by contrast, figures ~…~ the place of the social order?s death drive ~…~ queerness attains its ethical value precisely insofar as it accedes to that place, accepting its figural status as resistance to the viability of the social (Edelman 2004: 3) nothing could be queerer than the love for animals, which, by its very nature, which entails a serious and irrevocable commitment to the dismantling of the performances and devices on which social order as such rests, "marks the „other? side of politics: ~…~ the side outside all political sides, committed as they are, on every side, to futurism?s unquestioned good" (Edelman 2004: 7). It is thus no coincidence that the fetish of the Child should be omnipresent in the many-sided polemic against animal rights. In public debates, anti-vivisection activists are routinely asked by experimenters whether they would rather kill a mouse or a child (the answer is, of course, neither); and every time the subject of animal rights is brought up not merely as a topic of academic discussion but in appeals for practical or Journal for Critical Animal Studies, Volume VIII, Issue 1/2, 2010 (ISSN1948-352X) 106 financial support, the most common form of refusal invariably brings up starving children as the more appropriate recipients of concern and aid. That the people who give this kind of answers do nothing whatsoever to relieve the plight of children in need does not matter rhetorically: what does matter is that the appeal for children "is impossible to refuse ~…~ this issue, like an ideological Möbius strip, only permit~s~ one side" (Edelman 2004 2).. And any animal queer human can, from systematic and bitter personal experience, agree with Edelman that this is "oppressively political ~…~ insofar as the fantasy subtending the image of the Child invariably shapes the logic within which the political itself must be thought" (Edelman 2004 2). The emotions, feelings, thoughts and actions which make up the fabric of life for an animal queer person decentre the human and humanity from their positions as the taken-for granted subjects, and implicitly but powerfully question reproductive futurism. What Edelman calls the ideological limit on political discourse as such, preserving in the process the absolute privilege of heteronormativity, by rendering unthinkable, by casting outside the political domain, the possibility of a queer resistance to this organizing principle of human relations (Edelman 2004: 2) is shattered by an animal queer perspective. In its animal incarnation, more than in any other of its innumerable avatars, "~t~he queer comes to figure the bar to every realization of futurity, the resistance ~…~ to every social structure or form" (Edelman 2004 4)". And the real reason why liberalism grants a place to "the queer" in its LGBT incarnation but marginalizes, ridicules, represses and murders animal queer is that the denial and repression of "the queerness of resistance to futurism and thus the queerness of the queer" (Edelman 2004 27) are perfectly compatible with a civil rights perspective on same-sex love, but utterly incompatible with animal rights. An animal queer perspective is indeed ~i~ntent on the end, not the ends, of the social, ~...~ insists that the drive toward that end, which liberalism refuses to imagine, can never be excluded from the structuring fantasy of the social order itself. (Edelman 2004: 28) The "deliberate~...~ severing of us from ourselves" that Edelman (5) mentions as the hallmark of queer is implicit in the love for an animal. Animal queer severs us from Journal for Critical Animal Studies, Volume VIII, Issue 1/2, 2010 (ISSN1948-352X) 107 ourselves because it decentres our perspective: suddenly, other values, other interests, other feelings, though incommensurable and unimaginable, become equivalent to our own. The queerest expression of this attitude in the animal rights field (or, for that matter, anywhere, at least as far as I know...) is VHEMT, the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement, which unwittingly but appropriately takes up Edelman’s challenge that "Queerness should and must redefine such notions as "civil order" through a rupturing of our foundational faith in the reproduction of futurity" (Edelman 2004 16-17) and embodies the only oppositional status to which our queerness could ever lead ~which~ would depend on us taking seriously the place of the death drive ~…~ and insisting ~…~ that we do not intend a new politics, a better society, a brighter tomorrow, since all of those fantasies reproduce the past, through displacement, in the form of the future. (Edelman 2004 31) The Voluntary Human Extinction Movement Motto: "May we live long and die out" VHEMT (pronounced vehement) is a movement not an organization. It?s a movement advanced by people who care about life on planet Earth. ~...~ As VHEMT Volunteers know, the hopeful alternative to the extinction of millions of species of plants and animals is the voluntary extinction of one species: Homo sapiens... us.~...~ When every human chooses to stop breeding, Earth?s biosphere will be allowed to return to its former glory, and all remaining creatures will be free to live, die, evolve (if they believe in evolution), and will perhaps pass away, as so many of Nature?s "experiments" have done throughout the eons. It?s going to take all of us going. At first glance, some people assume that VHEMT Volunteers and Supporters must hate people and that we want everyone to commit suicide or become victims of mass murder. It?s easy to forget that another way to bring about a reduction in our numbers is to simply stop making more of us. Making babies seems to be a blind spot in our outlooks on life.

The mission of VHEMT actualizes what Edelman wrote about: "the death drive names what the queer, in the order of the social, is called forth to figure: the negativity opposed to every form of social viability" (Edelman 2004 9). In envisioning a world where no opposition to the social will be necessary, because the social will no longer be a possibility, VHEMT radically refuses this mandate by which our political institutions compel the collective reproduction of the Child ~and therefore~ must appear as a threat not only to the organization of a given social order but also, and far more ominously, to social order as such, insofar as it threatens the order of futurism on which meaning always depends. (Edelman 2004: 11) Because of its refusal of any "identification both of and with the Child as the preeminent emblem of the motivating end, though one endlessly postponed, of every political vision as a vision of futurity", VHEMT is the most coherent and most radical incarnation of "a queer oppositional politics" (Edelman 2004: 13).</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h3 id="HAT:roleplaying" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>AT: roleplaying</span></h3><p>Their politics causes passivity and destroys value to life <br/><strong>Antonio 95</strong> (Robert J Antonio, PhD in sociology, professor of sociology at the University of Kansas, July 1995, "Nietzsche’s Antisociology: Subjectified Culture and the End of History," American Journal of Sociology Volume 101 Number 1, GENDER MODIFIED)</p><p>According to Nietzsche, the "subject" is Socratic culture’s most central, durable <br/>AND<br/>117-18, 213, 288-89, 303-4).</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h2 id="H1NR-5" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>1NR</span></h2><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h2 id="HEnvironment" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Environment</span></h2><h4 id="HRepealoftheembargokillsbiodiversity2013Cubaisahotspot" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Repeal of the embargo kills biodiversity – Cuba is a hotspot</span></h4><p><strong>PBS, 10</strong> – Public Broadcasting Service, ("Cuba: The Accidental Eden A Brief Environmental History" Sep 27, 2010, www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/episodes/cuba-the-accidental-eden/a-brief-environmental-history/5830/)<em>ah</em></p><p>Cuba has been called the "Accidental Eden" for its exceptional biodiversity and unique <br/>AND<br/>some conservationists see Cuba’s position as an opportunity to set a constructive example.</p><h2 id="HAbleism" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Ableism</span></h2><h3 id="HOV-1" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>OV</span></h3><p><strong>Berube 2003</strong> (Michael, "Citizenship and Disability: Disability is a matter of civil rights, even if the Supreme Court doesn’t seem to agree.", <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.alternet.org/story/15809/citizenship_and_disability)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.alternet.org/story/15809/citizenship_and_disability)%27" tppabs="http://www.alternet.org/story/15809/citizenship_and_disability)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.alternet.org/story/15809/citizenship_and_disability)</span></a></span><br/>Imagine a building in which political philosophers are debating, in the wake of the <br/>AND<br/>, which is to say, for the good of all of us.</p><h3 id="HLink-1" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Link</span></h3><h4 id="HMobilitydiscoursereinforcesthehegemonyofthemobilebody" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Mobility discourse reinforces the hegemony of the mobile body</span></h4><p><strong>Imrie University of London Geography Professor 2000</strong><br/>(Rob Imrie, January 6, 2000 Environment and Planning A 2000, volume 32, Disability and discourses of mobility and movement <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.envplan.com/abstract.cgi?id=a331-http://www.envplan.com/abstract.cgi?id=a331  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path excluded from retrieval by the project\%27s Exclusions properties.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.envplan.com/abstract.cgi?id=a331-http://www.envplan.com/abstract.cgi?id=a331%27" tppabs="http://www.envplan.com/abstract.cgi?id=a331-http://www.envplan.com/abstract.cgi?id=a331"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.envplan.com/abstract.cgi?id=a331-http://www.envplan.com/abstract.cgi?id=a331</span></a></span> pg. 1643 accessed 7-6-12 BC)</p><p>Such discourses see disability as a social burden which is a private, not public<br/>AND<br/>of movement and bodily functions;

As the doctrine of national security was being &nbsp;born, the major player on the international stage would aim to use &nbsp;perhaps its most important power of all – its <br/>economic strength – in &nbsp;order to re-order the world. And this re<br/>AND<br/>by using notions such as ’personal &nbsp;freedom’ and’social equality’.101 <br/>Marx and Engels once highlighted the historical role of the bour geoisie in shaping the <br/>AND<br/>In one word, it creates a world &nbsp;after its own image.102 <br/>In the second half of the twentieth century this ability to ’batter down &nbsp;all <br/>AND<br/>only nestled, settled and established &nbsp;connections, but also’secured’ everywhere. <br/>Security politics thereby became the basis of a distinctly liberal &nbsp;philosophy of global ’intervention’<br/>AND<br/>rogue’ or ’outlaw’ states on the ’wrong side of &nbsp;history’.104 <br/>’Extrapolating the ?gures as best we can’, one CIA agent commented in 1991,’there have been about 3,000 major covert operations &nbsp;and over 10,000 minor operations<br/>MARKED<br/>&nbsp;– all illegal, and all designed to &nbsp;disrupt, destabilize, or modify <br/>AND<br/>of neo-liberal regulations. &nbsp;But a wide range of other techniques have <br/>been used: terror bombing; subversion; rigging elections; the use of the CIA’s ’Health Alteration &nbsp;Committee’ whose mandate was to ’incapacitate’ foreign of?cials; &nbsp;drug-traf?cking;107 and the sponsorship of terror groups, counterinsurgency agencies, death squads. Unsurprisingly, some plain old &nbsp;fascist groups and parties have been co-<br/>opted into the project, from &nbsp;the attempt at reviving the remnants of the Nazi collaborationist &nbsp;Vlasov Army for use against the USSR to the use of fascist forces to &nbsp;undermine democratically elected governments, such as in Chile; &nbsp;indeed, one of the <br/>reasons fascism ?owed into Latin America was &nbsp;because of the ideology of national security.108 <br/>Concomitantly, ’national &nbsp;security’ has meant a policy of non-intervention where satisfactory &nbsp;’security partnerships’ could be established with certain authoritarian &nbsp;and military regimes: Spain under Franco, the Greek junta, Chile, &nbsp;Iraq, Iran, Korea, Indonesia, Cambodia, Taiwan, South Vietnam, the &nbsp;Philippines, Turkey, the ?ve Central Asian republics that emerged with &nbsp;the break-up of the USSR, and China. Either way, the whole world &nbsp;was to be included in the new’secure’ global liberal order. <br/>The result has been the slaughter of untold numbers. John Stock well, who was part of a CIA project in Angola which led to the deaths &nbsp;of over 20,000 people, puts it like this: <br/>Coming to grips with these U.S./CIA activities in broad numbers &nbsp;and <br/>AND<br/>I was part of – &nbsp;and 22,000 killed in Nicaragua.109 <br/>Note that the six million is a minimum ?gure, that he omits to &nbsp;mention <br/>AND<br/>the world, and launched a new &nbsp;round of slaughtering to prove it. <br/>While much has been made about the supposedly ’new’ doctrine of &nbsp;preemption in the <br/>AND<br/>, the United States will, if necessary, act pre &nbsp;emptively.110 <br/>In other words, the security policy of the world’s only superpower in &nbsp;its current ’war on terror’ is still underpinned by a notion of liberal &nbsp;order-building based on a certain vision of ’economic order’. The &nbsp;National Security Strategy concerns itself with a ’single sustainable &nbsp;model for national success’ based on ’political and economic liberty’, &nbsp;with whole sections devoted to the security bene?ts of ’economic &nbsp;liberty’, and the bene?ts to liberty of the security strategy proposed.111&nbsp;</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h1 id="H1NR-7" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>1NR</span></h1><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h2 id="HMultilat-1" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Multilat</span></h2><p>China won’t escalate conflict<br/><strong>Goldstein 11</strong> - Professor and Director of the China Maritime Studies Institute @ US Naval War College ~Dr. Lyle J.

As the doctrine of national security was being &nbsp;born, the major player on the international stage would aim to use &nbsp;perhaps its most important power of all – its <br/>economic strength – in &nbsp;order to re-order the world. And this re<br/>AND<br/>by using notions such as ’personal &nbsp;freedom’ and’social equality’.101 <br/>Marx and Engels once highlighted the historical role of the bour geoisie in shaping the <br/>AND<br/>In one word, it creates a world &nbsp;after its own image.102 <br/>In the second half of the twentieth century this ability to ’batter down &nbsp;all <br/>AND<br/>only nestled, settled and established &nbsp;connections, but also’secured’ everywhere. <br/>Security politics thereby became the basis of a distinctly liberal &nbsp;philosophy of global ’intervention’<br/>AND<br/>rogue’ or ’outlaw’ states on the ’wrong side of &nbsp;history’.104 <br/>’Extrapolating the ?gures as best we can’, one CIA agent commented in 1991<br/>AND<br/>of neo-liberal regulations. &nbsp;But a wide range of other techniques have <br/>been used: terror bombing; subversion; rigging elections; the use of the CIA’s ’Health Alteration &nbsp;Committee’ whose mandate was to ’incapacitate’ foreign of?cials; &nbsp;drug-traf?cking;107 and the sponsorship of terror groups, counterinsurgency agencies, death squads. Unsurprisingly, some plain old &nbsp;fascist groups and parties have been co-<br/>opted into the project, from &nbsp;the attempt at reviving the remnants of the Nazi collaborationist &nbsp;Vlasov Army for use against the USSR to the use of fascist forces to &nbsp;undermine democratically elected governments, such as in Chile; &nbsp;indeed, one of the <br/>reasons fascism ?owed into Latin America was &nbsp;because of the ideology of national security.108 <br/>Concomitantly, ’national &nbsp;security’ has meant a policy of non-intervention where satisfactory &nbsp;’security partnerships’ could be established with certain authoritarian &nbsp;and military regimes: Spain under Franco, the Greek junta, Chile, &nbsp;Iraq, Iran, Korea, Indonesia, Cambodia, Taiwan, South Vietnam, the &nbsp;Philippines, Turkey, the ?ve Central Asian republics that emerged with &nbsp;the break-up of the USSR, and China. Either way, the whole world &nbsp;was to be included in the new’secure’ global liberal order. <br/>The result has been the slaughter of untold numbers. John Stock well, who was part of a CIA project in Angola which led to the deaths &nbsp;of over 20,000 people, puts it like this: <br/>Coming to grips with these U.S./CIA activities in broad numbers &nbsp;and <br/>AND<br/>I was part of – &nbsp;and 22,000 killed in Nicaragua.109 <br/>Note that the six million is a minimum ?gure, that he omits to &nbsp;mention <br/>AND<br/>the world, and launched a new &nbsp;round of slaughtering to prove it. <br/>While much has been made about the supposedly ’new’ doctrine of &nbsp;preemption in the <br/>AND<br/>, the United States will, if necessary, act pre &nbsp;emptively.110 <br/>In other words, the security policy of the world’s only superpower in &nbsp;its current ’war on terror’ is still underpinned by a notion of liberal &nbsp;order-building based on a certain vision of ’economic order’.

Where, we might ask, in the light of our experience, the statistics, our philosophy, or any documentary evidence outside popular romance, are its guarantees, its continuities, proof of its ability to fulfill its undertakings?<br/>At the same time, no amount of skepticism does away with desire which, <br/>AND<br/>desire, of what we know our desire to be (PC 194).<br/>When Ferdinand de Saussure drew attention to the problem of translation, he enabled his <br/>AND<br/>relegated by the signifier, the signified has no autonomy, no substance.<br/>There is thus no guarantee that our linguistic, signifying, differential cognitive maps are <br/>AND<br/>efface old convictions.

It assessed and weighed the <br/>AND<br/>intentioned, has come to look like the last infirmity of noble minds.<br/>Or worse. Because truth is a legislator, and it has imposed its values on all those who have had a more restricted access to it, who have not been entitled to act as its guarantors-the working class, the non- Western world, women. As palpably as any fundamentalism (if less spectacularly), middle-class, white, patriarchal truth has legitimated exclusions, oppressions, and violence; it has justified appropriation, damage, and destruction.<br/>And true love, too, itself another kind of fundamentalism, has legalized prohibitions<br/>AND<br/>violence and child abuse, concealed within the privacy of the nuclear family.<br/>II<br/>Love is thus at once endlessly pursued and ceaselessly suspected. Can such a paradoxical value speak or be spoken? Desired as the ultimate good, feared as constraint, doubted as an illusion, postmodern love is both silent and garrulous. It cannot speak, and yet it seems that it never ceases to speak in late twentieth-century Western culture.<br/>It is silent, first, in recognition of its deep banality.

The question of a structural dichotomy between blackness and whiteness dominates discussions, forcing people to rethink their relationship to race and privilege. This binary is a productive one, but it masks a structural silence on the status of other identities that undermines its emancipatory goals.<br/><strong>Alcoff, 3</strong> (Linda Martin Alcoff – professor of philosophy at CUNY, 2003, "LATINO/AS, ASIAN AMERICANS, AND THE BLACK–WHITE BINARY", The Journal of Ethics, Volume 7, pp. 5-27) <em>MD</em></p><p>¶ It is unlikely that the electoral college will be eliminated anytime soon, ¶ <br/>AND<br/>well (or at least for white union households and the white poor).&nbsp;</p><p>This silence smooths over different forms of racism and either discards them as irrelevant or integrates them within the logic of antiblackness.

(Kim 1994, 71–72)<br/>Similar to the Mexican Americans in Texas, the Korean Americans have been denied the legal or socially recognized category of being a politicized group at the same time that they are made subject to group?based scapegoating. Moreover, as this event demonstrates, the black/white paradigm of race is incapable of theoretically or politically addressing racism among communities of color, or addressing racism, in other words, that is not all about white people.<br/>A response to this line of reasoning might be that it is white supremacy which <br/>AND<br/>awnd still acknowledge that racism has multiple targets and a variety of forms.<br/>Supporting the arguments of both Elaine Kim and Bong Hwan Kim, Juan Perea argues <br/>AND<br/>reason to reject this claim is their racialization or status as nonwhites). 3<br/>Roberto Suro argues that the black/white binary forces Latinos and other people of <br/>AND<br/>. But it leaves everyone else unprotected (1998, 370–71).<br/>Put in more general terms, these arguments can be summarized as follows:<br/>1) The black/white paradigm has disempowered various racial and ethnic groups from being able to define their own identity, to mark their difference and specificity beyond what could be captured on this limited map. Instead of naming and describing our own identity and social circumstance, we have had descriptions foisted on us from outside.<br/>2) Asian Americans and Latinos (among others) have historically been ignored or <br/>AND<br/>included in the discussions so that a more adequate account can be developed.<br/>3) By eliminating specificities within the large "black" or nonwhite group, <br/>AND<br/>of affirmative action in higher education, at the end of this chapter.<br/>4) Eliminating specificities within the large "black" or nonwhite group also makes it difficult to understand or address the real conflicts and differences within this amalgam of peoples. The black/white paradigm proposes to understand all conflicts between communities of color through antiblack racism and white supremacy, when the reality is more complex.<br/>5)For all these reasons, the black/white paradigm seriously undermines the possibility of achieving coalitions. It is obvious that keeping us in conflict with each other and not in coalition is in the interests of the current power structure.<br/>I would add to these arguments the following two.<br/>6) The black/white binary and the constant invocation of all race discourses and conflicts as between blacks and whites has produced an imaginary of race in this country in which a very large white majority confronts a relatively small black (p.256) minority. This imagery has the effect of reenforcing the sense of inevitability to white domination.<br/>This is not the reality of racial percentages in almost any major urban center in <br/>AND<br/>white union members voting the same as the majority of people of color.<br/>Thus, thinking of race only in terms of black and white produces a sense <br/>AND<br/>. This is in everyone’s interests (or at least, the majority’s).<br/>7) The next argument that I would make in regard to the black/<br/>AND<br/>is that this continuum is not the only axis by which racism operates.<br/>Some have taken the horrific hierarchy of adoption preferences in the United States, that <br/>AND<br/>accepted here as white (Okihiro 1994; Prashad 2000; Wu 2002).</p><p>The silence bred by the dominance of the black/white binary allows conservative forces to divide and conquer – the model minority myth, the tale of the high-performing Asian who proves that social uplift is possible is a paradigmatic example of a liminal identity being redeployed as a weapon in service of antiblackness<br/><strong>Prashad 2</strong> (Vijay Prashad, George and Martha Kellner Chair in South Asian History and Professor of International Studies, 2002, "Everybody Was Kung Fu Fighting," pp. 40-46<br/>The moral and political weight of the civil rights movement forced a recalcitrant U.<br/>AND<br/>perhaps further from King’s ’’content of their character’’ message than we suspect.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>The alternative is to reject black/white binary – only moving beyond the binary can explain multiple operations of racism &nbsp;<br/>Perea 97 (Juan F.

"We don’t have to give up security to get efficiency, or efficiency to get security."<br/>He was one of a group of panelists from the government, academic and private sectors who met Friday at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in advance of a series of visits to key border sites next week.<br/>The five days of visits, beginning Monday, will include meetings with public officials and businesses on both sides of the border, to get a close-up look at how trade actually happens each day along the 2,000-mile Southwest boundary.<br/>&nbsp;"The Mexico border region is one of the wealthiest areas on the planet, maybe the fourth-largest economy in the world," said Erik Lee, associate director of the North American Center for Transborder Studies at Arizona State University.<br/>But Lee and Wilson, who co-authored a report on transborder economics that was released Friday, said there are numerous obstacles to developing that economy.<br/>On top of stepped-up security efforts, Wilson said, deteriorating roads, bridges and ports of entry have added hours to the time it takes businesses and tourists to cross. Those delays have caused some business to move operations to Asia, according to their report.<br/>&nbsp;"We are way behind in constructing infrastructure to facilitate trade along the U.S.-Mexico border," said Lee, adding that there is as much as 246 billion in backlogged maintenance to that infrastructure.<br/><strong>Lexington’s card ends</strong><br/>He said U.S. manufacturing, tourism and retail businesses would feel a significant boost if the infrastructure were brought up to par.<br/>Wilson also said there is a greater need for "security intelligence" and a voluntary trusted-traveler program for frequent border crossers. He pointed out that 85 percent of Mexican tourists come through land ports of entry.<br/>"A border trusted-traveler program can shrink the haystack that border agents have to sift through, with intelligence offered voluntarily," Wilson said.</p><h3 id="HChina-1" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>China</span></h3><h4 id="HNoChina-Taiwanwar2013empirics" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>No China-Taiwan war – empirics</span></h4><p>McCarthy 4 (Daniel McCarthy, lawyer in Salt Lake City, Utah, former resident of Taiwan, China traveler, US-Chinese businessman, and student of military affairs and of US-China-Taiwan relations; "Ignore the rhetoric, China won’t attack Taiwan," 2004, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/FB11Ad06.html)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/FB11Ad06.html)%27" tppabs="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/FB11Ad06.html)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/FB11Ad06.html)</span></a></span></p><p>Over the past several years, reports of China threatening to attack Taiwan have become <br/>AND<br/>likely to take place.

Caught between social hopes and political myths, the challenge of responding to environmental destruction confronts, starkly, the core of a discourse of modernity characterised by reflection, responsibility and action. Given the increasing pressures upon the human habitat, this modern discourse will either deliver or it will fail. There is little room for an existence in between: either the Enlightenment fulfils its potentiality or it shows its hand as the bearer of impossibility. If the possibilities of the Enlightenment are to be fulfilled then this can only happen if the old idea of the progress of the human species, exemplified by Hawking’s cosmic colonisation, is fundamentally rethought and replaced by a new form of self-comprehension. This self-comprehension would need to negate and limit the old modern humanism by a radical anti-humanism. The aim, however, would be to not just accept one side or the other, but to re-think the basis of moral action along the lines of a dialectical, utopian anti-humanism. Importantly, though, getting past inadequate conceptions of action, historical time and the futural promise of progress may be dependent upon radically re-comprehending the relationship between humanity and nature in such a way that the human is no longer viewed as the sole core of the subject, or the being of highest value.

But the way it operates is not new. It is, in its essentials exactly the way described by Marx The only sense in which Marx is “outdated” is not that the system is more rational than he thought but rather his picture understates the destructiveness of the system. Capitalists do not merely battle against each other on the markets. They also use the state to force rival capitalists to accept their dictates, supplementing economic competition with displays of military prowess. American capitalism seeks to persuade European and Japanese capitalism to accept its dictates by proving that it alone has the power to wage war in the vital oil rich regions of the middle east; Iranian and Turkish capitalists rely on the help of their states as they compete with each other for influence and contracts in the southern belt of the former USSR; Turkish and Greek capitalists encourage a mini-arms race as each seeks to establish a dominate role in the Balkan countries once controlled by Russia; Germany backs Croatia, the US backs Bosnian Muslims, and Greece backs the Serbs to the horrific wars in the former Yugoslavia; the Russian military wage vicious wars to hang onto vital oil pipelines &nbsp;through Chechnya and in the Tadjik republic bordering Afghanistan; China the Philippines, Malaysia and Vietnam clash over control of the oil reserves thought to lie close to the uninhabited islands in the China Sea; Israel tries to carve Egypt out from economic influence in the Arabian peninsula. The result is that at any point in time there are half a dozen wars or civil wars using the most horrendous forms for “conventional” weaponry in one part of the world or another. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alongside the slaughter and devastation afflicting ever wider sections of humanity is another threat to us all which is hardly visible in Marx’s time- the threat of destruction of the environment we depend on to survive. Marx and Engels were fully aware that the mad drive to capital accumulation led to pollution, the poisoning of the ground and air, the adulteration of foodstuffs and the spread of horrific epidemics. Engels wrote vividly of these things in his book Anti-duhring. But they lived in a time when capitalist industry was confined to relatively small areas of the globe and the devastation was local devastation, affecting chiefly the workers employed in a particular factory, mill or mining village. Today capitalist industry operates on a global scale and its impact is on the global environment- as is shown by the way in which radioactive clouds over Chernobyl spread across the whole of Europe, by the way in which the seas are being fished clean of fish, by the damage to the ozone layer by the gases used in aerosols and refrigerators. Above all there is the threat of the ‘greenhouse’ gases destabilizing the whole world’s climate, flooding low lying countries turning fertile regions into desert&nbsp;</p><p>And, capitalism destroys the environment and is the root cause of oppression<br/>Latin America Solidarity Coalition, 2003 (“Getting to the Roots: Ecology and Environmental Justice”, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.lasolidarity.org/papers/enviro.htm)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.lasolidarity.org/papers/enviro.htm)%27" tppabs="http://www.lasolidarity.org/papers/enviro.htm)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.lasolidarity.org/papers/enviro.htm)</span></a></span><br/>The globalization of capital and the … to desperation, degradation and suffering.</p><p>The alternative is to reject their assertion that discourse and performance can change material social realities.</p><p>We must return to Marx, recognizing that the only hope for human survival is a politics which engages in struggles to change material social relations rather than discursive attempts to change assumptions—any attempt to work within the system of capitalism is doomed to failure – turns the aff<br/>Harman, 97 Editor of the Socialst Worker 1997<br/>(Chris, Economics of the madhouse, Pg 99-100)<br/>&nbsp;‘A reprise in the early 21st century of the … on the lives of the mass of people. &nbsp;<br/>Off</p><p>ASPEC</p><p>Third, absent specifying, these debates will always lead to a permutation obviating the research ground for comparative institutional analysis<br/>Komesar 94 (Neil Komesar, professor of Law at the University of Wisconsin, “Imperfect Alternatives: Choosing Institutions in Law, Economics, and Public Policy,” p 41-2)<br/>Even the constitutions of totalitarian … more-complex definitions of the good.</p><p>Comparative institutional analysis is the most fundamental question for academics working for social change.

Mellon Professor of the Humanities @ Brown - 1993<br/>(Rey, Writing Diaspora: Tactics of Intervention in Contemporary Cultural Studies, p. 10-11)&nbsp;</p><p>The Orientalist has a special sibling whom I will, … power that enables her rhetoric.</p><p>The subaltern is subsequently reduced to a fungible object, a passive object for the consumption of the debate community – the affirmative absorbs the power of alterity only to toss its carcass back into the dust<br/>Chow 93 (Rey, Andrew W. Mellon, Professor of the Humanities at Brown University, Writing Diaspora: Contemporary Tactics of Intervention in Contemporary Cultural Studies, Indiana University Press, pg. 12-13.)</p><p>In the “cultural studies” of the American … had our consciousnesses “raised.”</p><p>The AFF’s demand for action is a way of covering over the ways in which forms of oppression work in the present. We cannot transcend that oppression through speech – the role of the intellectual should be to intervene into the political economy of commodification and expose how systems of oppression are functioning in the here and now. The AFF’s desire for transcendence gives the illusion of progress while being an interpassive form which prevents proper analysis.<br/>Ahmed, 4<br/>/Sarah, Reader in Race and Cultural Studies, Goldsmiths College, University of London.
