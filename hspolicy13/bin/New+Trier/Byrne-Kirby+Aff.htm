Consider for clarity the case when the concentration of the dissolved gas is only slightly below saturation throughout, and thus increases downward in accordance with Henry’s law. Then locally there is no tendency for the dissolved gas to exsolve (to form bubbles), in spite of the fact that nuclei are abundant in seawater. (Exsolution would lead to a slight increase in free energy: below saturation, the chemical potential of the gas species is lower in solution than in the free gas phase.) At the same time, the free energy of the system as a whole would be greatly reduced if most of the dissolved gas were to somehow escape from solution and collect above the liquid. (This free energy reduction is due to the fast decrease of the chemical potential of gas with a drop in pressure.) Thus, the system is in a metastable state, albeit an unusual one. Strictly speaking, this state is not an equilibrium one even locally: the increase of the solute concentration with depth causes a diffusion ?ux directed upward, which, given suf?cient time, could bring the system into the above state of minimum free energy. However, the continuous supply of methane by the rising bubbles from the sea?oor ensures that the concentration pro?le will remain nonuniform, slowly approaching the saturation one. Even if that supply were to cease, the diffusion time scales are so long that this path toward the global energy minimum can be ignored. A very fast transition from this metastable state can be triggered by disturbances that displace ?uid a ?nite distance in the vertical direction. Such disturbances may result from an earthquake, a sea?oor volcano, convection currents due to geothermal heating, or an internal gravity wave. Consider a parcel of ?uid that is displaced upward, and is now subject to lower hydrostatic pressure, to which corresponds a lower solubility value. As a result, the ?uid in the parcel is now supersaturated with the dissolved gas, which must begin to exsolve, forming tiny gas bubbles. (If the ?uid in its original position was only partially saturated, exsolution will begin after the parcel has risen through some signi?cant distance, so in this case the initial disturbance must be suf?ciently large.) The volume of the ascending parcel of ?uid increases due to the formation of bubbles, making it more buoyant and accelerating its rise; this leads to further reduction in the ambient pressure, further exsolution of gas, and further increase in the volume of the parcel. This self-accelerating motion entrains the surrounding ?uid; exsolution of the gas in the latter reinforces the motion. The result is a violent eruption (Kling et al., 1987; Zhang, 1996). From the initial eruption site, hydrodynamic disturbances propagate in all directions (via turbulent entrainment and/or internal gravity waves), triggering eruptions at other sites. Similarly to transitions from other metastable states (e.g., boiling of a superheated liquid), the eruption should spread quickly throughout the region of the ocean where the water column is saturated, or partially saturated, with gas. In spite of the low solubility of methane in seawater, the total possible increase in the buoyancy of the parcel can be large. Consider a parcel that started its rise at 4 km depth, where solubility of methane is ;4.3 3 1023 . Then, if the parcel had a volume of 18 cm3 (1 mol of water) and was saturated with methane, it contained 4.3 3 1023 mol of dissolved methane. By the time this parcel has risen to the surface, essentially all the methane in the parcel has exsolved (solubility is ;2 3 1025 at the surface). At the surface conditions (T ø 25 8C, P 5 1 bar), 1 mol of any gas occupies 25 3 10 3 cm3 , so the total volume of methane in the parcel is ;108 cm3 , and the volume of the parcel, which now contains a mist of water droplets in gaseous methane, is 126 cm3 . That is, the volume of the parcel has increased by a factor of seven. Concurrent exsolution of other dissolved gases (e.g., carbon dioxide CO2 , hydrogen sul?de H2 S) will add to the effect. A rather similar process is responsible for the most violent, explosive volcanic eruptions (called Plinian), such as eruptions of Mount Vesuvius in A.D. 79 or Mount St. Helens in 1980. These eruptions are driven by exsolution of gases (primarily water vapor) dissolved in the liquid magma. In Lake Nyos (Cameroon), CO2 of magmatic origin enters the water column from the bottom, at a depth of ;200 m. In 1986, the lake erupted, creating a gas-water fountain ;120 m in height (Zhang, 1996), and releasing a lethal cloud of CO2 . A water surge washed up the shore to a height of ;25 m. The eruption continued for several hours (Kling et al., 1987). OCEANIC ERUPTION AS A CAUSE OF MASS EXTINCTION The consequences of a methane-driven oceanic eruption for marine and terrestrial life are likely to be catastrophic. Figuratively speaking, the erupting region ’’boils over,’’ ejecting a large amount of methane and other gases (e.g., CO2 , H2 S) into the atmosphere, and ?ooding large areas of land. Whereas pure methane is lighter than air, methane loaded with water droplets is much heavier, and thus spreads over the land, mixing with air in the process (and losing water as rain). The air methane mixture is explosive at methane concentrations between 5 and 15; as such mixtures form in different locations near the ground and are ignited by lightning, explosions 2 and con?agrations destroy most of the terrestrial life, and also produce great amounts of smoke and of carbon dioxide. Firestorms carry smoke and dust into the upper atmosphere, where they may remain for several years (Turco et al., 1991); the resulting darkness and global cooling may provide an additional kill mechanism. Conversely, carbon dioxide and the remaining methane create the greenhouse effect, which may lead to global warming. The outcome of the competition between the cooling and the warming tendencies is dif?cult to predict (Turco et al., 1991; Pierrehumbert, 2002). Upon release of a signi?cant portion of the dissolved methane, the ocean settles down, and the entire sequence of events (i.e., development of anoxia, accumulation of dissolved methane, the metastable state, eruption) begins anew. No external cause is required to bring about a methane-driven eruption—its mechanism is self-contained, and implies that eruptions are likely to occur repeatedly at the same location. Because methane is isotopically light, its fast release must result in a negative carbon isotope excursion in the geological record. Knowing the magnitude of the excursion, one can estimate the amount of methane that could have produced it. Such calculations (prompted by the methane-hydrate-dissociation model, but equally applicable here) have been performed for several global events in the geological record; the results range from ;10 18 to 10 19 g of released methane (e.g., Katz et al., 1999; Kennedy et al., 2001; de Wit et al., 2002). These are very large amounts: the total carbon content of today’s terrestrial biomass is ;2 3 10 18 g. Nevertheless, relatively small regions of the deep ocean could contain such amounts of dissolved methane; e.g., the Black Sea alone (volume ;0.4 3 1023 of the ocean total; maximum depth only 2.2 km) could hold, at saturation, ;0.5 3 10 18 g. A similar region of the deep ocean could contain much more (the amount grows quadratically with depth 3 ). Released in a geological instant (weeks, perhaps), 10 18 to 10 19 g of methane could destroy the terrestrial life almost entirely. Combustion and explosion of 0.75 3 10 19 g of methane would liberate energy equivalent to 10 8 Mt of TNT, ;10,000 times greater than the world’s stockpile of nuclear weapons, implicated in the nuclearwinter scenario (Turco et al., 1991).&nbsp;</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h3 id="HContention2isCooperation" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Contention 2 is Cooperation</span></h3><h4 id="HScenarioOneisDrilling:" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Scenario One is Drilling:</span></h4><h4 id="HCubandrillingintheEasternGapisinevitable" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Cuban drilling in the Eastern Gap is inevitable</span></h4><p><strong>Tamayo ’13</strong><br/>(Juan – Writer at The Miami Herald.

Consider for clarity the case when the concentration of the dissolved gas is only slightly below saturation throughout, and thus increases downward in accordance with Henry’s law. Then locally there is no tendency for the dissolved gas to exsolve (to form bubbles), in spite of the fact that nuclei are abundant in seawater. (Exsolution would lead to a slight increase in free energy: below saturation, the chemical potential of the gas species is lower in solution than in the free gas phase.) At the same time, the free energy of the system as a whole would be greatly reduced if most of the dissolved gas were to somehow escape from solution and collect above the liquid. (This free energy reduction is due to the fast decrease of the chemical potential of gas with a drop in pressure.) Thus, the system is in a metastable state, albeit an unusual one. Strictly speaking, this state is not an equilibrium one even locally: the increase of the solute concentration with depth causes a diffusion ?ux directed upward, which, given suf?cient time, could bring the system into the above state of minimum free energy. However, the continuous supply of methane by the rising bubbles from the sea?oor ensures that the concentration pro?le will remain nonuniform, slowly approaching the saturation one. Even if that supply were to cease, the diffusion time scales are so long that this path toward the global energy minimum can be ignored. A very fast transition from this metastable state can be triggered by disturbances that displace ?uid a ?nite distance in the vertical direction. Such disturbances may result from an earthquake, a sea?oor volcano, convection currents due to geothermal heating, or an internal gravity wave. Consider a parcel of ?uid that is displaced upward, and is now subject to lower hydrostatic pressure, to which corresponds a lower solubility value. As a result, the ?uid in the parcel is now supersaturated with the dissolved gas, which must begin to exsolve, forming tiny gas bubbles. (If the ?uid in its original position was only partially saturated, exsolution will begin after the parcel has risen through some signi?cant distance, so in this case the initial disturbance must be suf?ciently large.) The volume of the ascending parcel of ?uid increases due to the formation of bubbles, making it more buoyant and accelerating its rise; this leads to further reduction in the ambient pressure, further exsolution of gas, and further increase in the volume of the parcel. This self-accelerating motion entrains the surrounding ?uid; exsolution of the gas in the latter reinforces the motion. The result is a violent eruption (Kling et al., 1987; Zhang, 1996). From the initial eruption site, hydrodynamic disturbances propagate in all directions (via turbulent entrainment and/or internal gravity waves), triggering eruptions at other sites. Similarly to transitions from other metastable states (e.g., boiling of a superheated liquid), the eruption should spread quickly throughout the region of the ocean where the water column is saturated, or partially saturated, with gas. In spite of the low solubility of methane in seawater, the total possible increase in the buoyancy of the parcel can be large. Consider a parcel that started its rise at 4 km depth, where solubility of methane is ;4.3 3 1023 . Then, if the parcel had a volume of 18 cm3 (1 mol of water) and was saturated with methane, it contained 4.3 3 1023 mol of dissolved methane. By the time this parcel has risen to the surface, essentially all the methane in the parcel has exsolved (solubility is ;2 3 1025 at the surface). At the surface conditions (T ø 25 8C, P 5 1 bar), 1 mol of any gas occupies 25 3 10 3 cm3 , so the total volume of methane in the parcel is ;108 cm3 , and the volume of the parcel, which now contains a mist of water droplets in gaseous methane, is 126 cm3 . That is, the volume of the parcel has increased by a factor of seven. Concurrent exsolution of other dissolved gases (e.g., carbon dioxide CO2 , hydrogen sul?de H2 S) will add to the effect. A rather similar process is responsible for the most violent, explosive volcanic eruptions (called Plinian), such as eruptions of Mount Vesuvius in A.D. 79 or Mount St. Helens in 1980. These eruptions are driven by exsolution of gases (primarily water vapor) dissolved in the liquid magma. In Lake Nyos (Cameroon), CO2 of magmatic origin enters the water column from the bottom, at a depth of ;200 m. In 1986, the lake erupted, creating a gas-water fountain ;120 m in height (Zhang, 1996), and releasing a lethal cloud of CO2 . A water surge washed up the shore to a height of ;25 m. The eruption continued for several hours (Kling et al., 1987). OCEANIC ERUPTION AS A CAUSE OF MASS EXTINCTION The consequences of a methane-driven oceanic eruption for marine and terrestrial life are likely to be catastrophic. Figuratively speaking, the erupting region ’’boils over,’’ ejecting a large amount of methane and other gases (e.g., CO2 , H2 S) into the atmosphere, and ?ooding large areas of land. Whereas pure methane is lighter than air, methane loaded with water droplets is much heavier, and thus spreads over the land, mixing with air in the process (and losing water as rain). The air methane mixture is explosive at methane concentrations between 5 and 15; as such mixtures form in different locations near the ground and are ignited by lightning, explosions 2 and con?agrations destroy most of the terrestrial life, and also produce great amounts of smoke and of carbon dioxide. Firestorms carry smoke and dust into the upper atmosphere, where they may remain for several years (Turco et al., 1991); the resulting darkness and global cooling may provide an additional kill mechanism. Conversely, carbon dioxide and the remaining methane create the greenhouse effect, which may lead to global warming. The outcome of the competition between the cooling and the warming tendencies is dif?cult to predict (Turco et al., 1991; Pierrehumbert, 2002). Upon release of a signi?cant portion of the dissolved methane, the ocean settles down, and the entire sequence of events (i.e., development of anoxia, accumulation of dissolved methane, the metastable state, eruption) begins anew. No external cause is required to bring about a methane-driven eruption—its mechanism is self-contained, and implies that eruptions are likely to occur repeatedly at the same location. Because methane is isotopically light, its fast release must result in a negative carbon isotope excursion in the geological record. Knowing the magnitude of the excursion, one can estimate the amount of methane that could have produced it. Such calculations (prompted by the methane-hydrate-dissociation model, but equally applicable here) have been performed for several global events in the geological record; the results range from ;10 18 to 10 19 g of released methane (e.g., Katz et al., 1999; Kennedy et al., 2001; de Wit et al., 2002). These are very large amounts: the total carbon content of today’s terrestrial biomass is ;2 3 10 18 g. Nevertheless, relatively small regions of the deep ocean could contain such amounts of dissolved methane; e.g., the Black Sea alone (volume ;0.4 3 1023 of the ocean total; maximum depth only 2.2 km) could hold, at saturation, ;0.5 3 10 18 g. A similar region of the deep ocean could contain much more (the amount grows quadratically with depth 3 ). Released in a geological instant (weeks, perhaps), 10 18 to 10 19 g of methane could destroy the terrestrial life almost entirely. Combustion and explosion of 0.75 3 10 19 g of methane would liberate energy equivalent to 10 8 Mt of TNT, ;10,000 times greater than the world’s stockpile of nuclear weapons, implicated in the nuclearwinter scenario (Turco et al., 1991).&nbsp;</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h3 id="HContention2isCooperation-1" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Contention 2 is Cooperation</span></h3><h4 id="HScenarioOneisDrilling:-1" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Scenario One is Drilling:</span></h4><h4 id="HCubandrillingintheEasternGapisinevitable-1" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Cuban drilling in the Eastern Gap is inevitable</span></h4><p><strong>Tamayo ’13</strong><br/>(Juan – Writer at The Miami Herald.

Consider for clarity the case when the concentration of the dissolved gas is only slightly below saturation throughout, and thus increases downward in accordance with Henry’s law. Then locally there is no tendency for the dissolved gas to exsolve (to form bubbles), in spite of the fact that nuclei are abundant in seawater. (Exsolution would lead to a slight increase in free energy: below saturation, the chemical potential of the gas species is lower in solution than in the free gas phase.) At the same time, the free energy of the system as a whole would be greatly reduced if most of the dissolved gas were to somehow escape from solution and collect above the liquid. (This free energy reduction is due to the fast decrease of the chemical potential of gas with a drop in pressure.) Thus, the system is in a metastable state, albeit an unusual one. Strictly speaking, this state is not an equilibrium one even locally: the increase of the solute concentration with depth causes a diffusion ?ux directed upward, which, given suf?cient time, could bring the system into the above state of minimum free energy. However, the continuous supply of methane by the rising bubbles from the sea?oor ensures that the concentration pro?le will remain nonuniform, slowly approaching the saturation one. Even if that supply were to cease, the diffusion time scales are so long that this path toward the global energy minimum can be ignored. A very fast transition from this metastable state can be triggered by disturbances that displace ?uid a ?nite distance in the vertical direction. Such disturbances may result from an earthquake, a sea?oor volcano, convection currents due to geothermal heating, or an internal gravity wave. Consider a parcel of ?uid that is displaced upward, and is now subject to lower hydrostatic pressure, to which corresponds a lower solubility value. As a result, the ?uid in the parcel is now supersaturated with the dissolved gas, which must begin to exsolve, forming tiny gas bubbles. (If the ?uid in its original position was only partially saturated, exsolution will begin after the parcel has risen through some signi?cant distance, so in this case the initial disturbance must be suf?ciently large.) The volume of the ascending parcel of ?uid increases due to the formation of bubbles, making it more buoyant and accelerating its rise; this leads to further reduction in the ambient pressure, further exsolution of gas, and further increase in the volume of the parcel. This self-accelerating motion entrains the surrounding ?uid; exsolution of the gas in the latter reinforces the motion. The result is a violent eruption (Kling et al., 1987; Zhang, 1996). From the initial eruption site, hydrodynamic disturbances propagate in all directions (via turbulent entrainment and/or internal gravity waves), triggering eruptions at other sites. Similarly to transitions from other metastable states (e.g., boiling of a superheated liquid), the eruption should spread quickly throughout the region of the ocean where the water column is saturated, or partially saturated, with gas. In spite of the low solubility of methane in seawater, the total possible increase in the buoyancy of the parcel can be large. Consider a parcel that started its rise at 4 km depth, where solubility of methane is ;4.3 3 1023 . Then, if the parcel had a volume of 18 cm3 (1 mol of water) and was saturated with methane, it contained 4.3 3 1023 mol of dissolved methane. By the time this parcel has risen to the surface, essentially all the methane in the parcel has exsolved (solubility is ;2 3 1025 at the surface). At the surface conditions (T ø 25 8C, P 5 1 bar), 1 mol of any gas occupies 25 3 10 3 cm3 , so the total volume of methane in the parcel is ;108 cm3 , and the volume of the parcel, which now contains a mist of water droplets in gaseous methane, is 126 cm3 . That is, the volume of the parcel has increased by a factor of seven. Concurrent exsolution of other dissolved gases (e.g., carbon dioxide CO2 , hydrogen sul?de H2 S) will add to the effect. A rather similar process is responsible for the most violent, explosive volcanic eruptions (called Plinian), such as eruptions of Mount Vesuvius in A.D. 79 or Mount St. Helens in 1980. These eruptions are driven by exsolution of gases (primarily water vapor) dissolved in the liquid magma. In Lake Nyos (Cameroon), CO2 of magmatic origin enters the water column from the bottom, at a depth of ;200 m. In 1986, the lake erupted, creating a gas-water fountain ;120 m in height (Zhang, 1996), and releasing a lethal cloud of CO2 . A water surge washed up the shore to a height of ;25 m. The eruption continued for several hours (Kling et al., 1987). OCEANIC ERUPTION AS A CAUSE OF MASS EXTINCTION The consequences of a methane-driven oceanic eruption for marine and terrestrial life are likely to be catastrophic. Figuratively speaking, the erupting region ’’boils over,’’ ejecting a large amount of methane and other gases (e.g., CO2 , H2 S) into the atmosphere, and ?ooding large areas of land. Whereas pure methane is lighter than air, methane loaded with water droplets is much heavier, and thus spreads over the land, mixing with air in the process (and losing water as rain). The air methane mixture is explosive at methane concentrations between 5 and 15; as such mixtures form in different locations near the ground and are ignited by lightning, explosions 2 and con?agrations destroy most of the terrestrial life, and also produce great amounts of smoke and of carbon dioxide. Firestorms carry smoke and dust into the upper atmosphere, where they may remain for several years (Turco et al., 1991); the resulting darkness and global cooling may provide an additional kill mechanism. Conversely, carbon dioxide and the remaining methane create the greenhouse effect, which may lead to global warming. The outcome of the competition between the cooling and the warming tendencies is dif?cult to predict (Turco et al., 1991; Pierrehumbert, 2002). Upon release of a signi?cant portion of the dissolved methane, the ocean settles down, and the entire sequence of events (i.e., development of anoxia, accumulation of dissolved methane, the metastable state, eruption) begins anew. No external cause is required to bring about a methane-driven eruption—its mechanism is self-contained, and implies that eruptions are likely to occur repeatedly at the same location. Because methane is isotopically light, its fast release must result in a negative carbon isotope excursion in the geological record. Knowing the magnitude of the excursion, one can estimate the amount of methane that could have produced it. Such calculations (prompted by the methane-hydrate-dissociation model, but equally applicable here) have been performed for several global events in the geological record; the results range from ;10 18 to 10 19 g of released methane (e.g., Katz et al., 1999; Kennedy et al., 2001; de Wit et al., 2002). These are very large amounts: the total carbon content of today’s terrestrial biomass is ;2 3 10 18 g. Nevertheless, relatively small regions of the deep ocean could contain such amounts of dissolved methane; e.g., the Black Sea alone (volume ;0.4 3 1023 of the ocean total; maximum depth only 2.2 km) could hold, at saturation, ;0.5 3 10 18 g. A similar region of the deep ocean could contain much more (the amount grows quadratically with depth 3 ). Released in a geological instant (weeks, perhaps), 10 18 to 10 19 g of methane could destroy the terrestrial life almost entirely. Combustion and explosion of 0.75 3 10 19 g of methane would liberate energy equivalent to 10 8 Mt of TNT, ;10,000 times greater than the world’s stockpile of nuclear weapons, implicated in the nuclearwinter scenario (Turco et al., 1991).&nbsp;</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h3 id="HContention2isCooperation-2" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Contention 2 is Cooperation</span></h3><h4 id="HScenarioOneisDrilling:-2" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Scenario One is Drilling:</span></h4><h4 id="HCubandrillingintheEasternGapisinevitable-2" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Cuban drilling in the Eastern Gap is inevitable</span></h4><p><strong>Tamayo ’13</strong><br/>(Juan – Writer at The Miami Herald.

Consider for clarity the case when the concentration of the dissolved gas is only slightly below saturation throughout, and thus increases downward in accordance with Henry’s law. Then locally there is no tendency for the dissolved gas to exsolve (to form bubbles), in spite of the fact that nuclei are abundant in seawater. (Exsolution would lead to a slight increase in free energy: below saturation, the chemical potential of the gas species is lower in solution than in the free gas phase.) At the same time, the free energy of the system as a whole would be greatly reduced if most of the dissolved gas were to somehow escape from solution and collect above the liquid. (This free energy reduction is due to the fast decrease of the chemical potential of gas with a drop in pressure.) Thus, the system is in a metastable state, albeit an unusual one. Strictly speaking, this state is not an equilibrium one even locally: the increase of the solute concentration with depth causes a diffusion ?ux directed upward, which, given suf?cient time, could bring the system into the above state of minimum free energy. However, the continuous supply of methane by the rising bubbles from the sea?oor ensures that the concentration pro?le will remain nonuniform, slowly approaching the saturation one. Even if that supply were to cease, the diffusion time scales are so long that this path toward the global energy minimum can be ignored. A very fast transition from this metastable state can be triggered by disturbances that displace ?uid a ?nite distance in the vertical direction. Such disturbances may result from an earthquake, a sea?oor volcano, convection currents due to geothermal heating, or an internal gravity wave. Consider a parcel of ?uid that is displaced upward, and is now subject to lower hydrostatic pressure, to which corresponds a lower solubility value. As a result, the ?uid in the parcel is now supersaturated with the dissolved gas, which must begin to exsolve, forming tiny gas bubbles. (If the ?uid in its original position was only partially saturated, exsolution will begin after the parcel has risen through some signi?cant distance, so in this case the initial disturbance must be suf?ciently large.) The volume of the ascending parcel of ?uid increases due to the formation of bubbles, making it more buoyant and accelerating its rise; this leads to further reduction in the ambient pressure, further exsolution of gas, and further increase in the volume of the parcel. This self-accelerating motion entrains the surrounding ?uid; exsolution of the gas in the latter reinforces the motion. The result is a violent eruption (Kling et al., 1987; Zhang, 1996). From the initial eruption site, hydrodynamic disturbances propagate in all directions (via turbulent entrainment and/or internal gravity waves), triggering eruptions at other sites. Similarly to transitions from other metastable states (e.g., boiling of a superheated liquid), the eruption should spread quickly throughout the region of the ocean where the water column is saturated, or partially saturated, with gas. In spite of the low solubility of methane in seawater, the total possible increase in the buoyancy of the parcel can be large. Consider a parcel that started its rise at 4 km depth, where solubility of methane is ;4.3 3 1023 . Then, if the parcel had a volume of 18 cm3 (1 mol of water) and was saturated with methane, it contained 4.3 3 1023 mol of dissolved methane. By the time this parcel has risen to the surface, essentially all the methane in the parcel has exsolved (solubility is ;2 3 1025 at the surface). At the surface conditions (T ø 25 8C, P 5 1 bar), 1 mol of any gas occupies 25 3 10 3 cm3 , so the total volume of methane in the parcel is ;108 cm3 , and the volume of the parcel, which now contains a mist of water droplets in gaseous methane, is 126 cm3 . That is, the volume of the parcel has increased by a factor of seven. Concurrent exsolution of other dissolved gases (e.g., carbon dioxide CO2 , hydrogen sul?de H2 S) will add to the effect. A rather similar process is responsible for the most violent, explosive volcanic eruptions (called Plinian), such as eruptions of Mount Vesuvius in A.D. 79 or Mount St. Helens in 1980. These eruptions are driven by exsolution of gases (primarily water vapor) dissolved in the liquid magma. In Lake Nyos (Cameroon), CO2 of magmatic origin enters the water column from the bottom, at a depth of ;200 m. In 1986, the lake erupted, creating a gas-water fountain ;120 m in height (Zhang, 1996), and releasing a lethal cloud of CO2 . A water surge washed up the shore to a height of ;25 m. The eruption continued for several hours (Kling et al., 1987). OCEANIC ERUPTION AS A CAUSE OF MASS EXTINCTION The consequences of a methane-driven oceanic eruption for marine and terrestrial life are likely to be catastrophic. Figuratively speaking, the erupting region ’’boils over,’’ ejecting a large amount of methane and other gases (e.g., CO2 , H2 S) into the atmosphere, and ?ooding large areas of land. Whereas pure methane is lighter than air, methane loaded with water droplets is much heavier, and thus spreads over the land, mixing with air in the process (and losing water as rain). The air methane mixture is explosive at methane concentrations between 5 and 15; as such mixtures form in different locations near the ground and are ignited by lightning, explosions 2 and con?agrations destroy most of the terrestrial life, and also produce great amounts of smoke and of carbon dioxide. Firestorms carry smoke and dust into the upper atmosphere, where they may remain for several years (Turco et al., 1991); the resulting darkness and global cooling may provide an additional kill mechanism. Conversely, carbon dioxide and the remaining methane create the greenhouse effect, which may lead to global warming. The outcome of the competition between the cooling and the warming tendencies is dif?cult to predict (Turco et al., 1991; Pierrehumbert, 2002). Upon release of a signi?cant portion of the dissolved methane, the ocean settles down, and the entire sequence of events (i.e., development of anoxia, accumulation of dissolved methane, the metastable state, eruption) begins anew. No external cause is required to bring about a methane-driven eruption—its mechanism is self-contained, and implies that eruptions are likely to occur repeatedly at the same location. Because methane is isotopically light, its fast release must result in a negative carbon isotope excursion in the geological record. Knowing the magnitude of the excursion, one can estimate the amount of methane that could have produced it. Such calculations (prompted by the methane-hydrate-dissociation model, but equally applicable here) have been performed for several global events in the geological record; the results range from ;10 18 to 10 19 g of released methane (e.g., Katz et al., 1999; Kennedy et al., 2001; de Wit et al., 2002). These are very large amounts: the total carbon content of today’s terrestrial biomass is ;2 3 10 18 g. Nevertheless, relatively small regions of the deep ocean could contain such amounts of dissolved methane; e.g., the Black Sea alone (volume ;0.4 3 1023 of the ocean total; maximum depth only 2.2 km) could hold, at saturation, ;0.5 3 10 18 g. A similar region of the deep ocean could contain much more (the amount grows quadratically with depth 3 ). Released in a geological instant (weeks, perhaps), 10 18 to 10 19 g of methane could destroy the terrestrial life almost entirely. Combustion and explosion of 0.75 3 10 19 g of methane would liberate energy equivalent to 10 8 Mt of TNT, ;10,000 times greater than the world’s stockpile of nuclear weapons, implicated in the nuclearwinter scenario (Turco et al., 1991).&nbsp;</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h3 id="HContention2isCooperation-3" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Contention 2 is Cooperation</span></h3><h4 id="HScenarioOneisDrilling:-3" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Scenario One is Drilling:</span></h4><h4 id="HCubandrillingintheEasternGapisinevitable-3" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Cuban drilling in the Eastern Gap is inevitable</span></h4><p><strong>Tamayo ’13</strong><br/>(Juan – Writer at The Miami Herald.

Consider for clarity the case when the concentration of the dissolved gas is only slightly below saturation throughout, and thus increases downward in accordance with Henry’s law. Then locally there is no tendency for the dissolved gas to exsolve (to form bubbles), in spite of the fact that nuclei are abundant in seawater. (Exsolution would lead to a slight increase in free energy: below saturation, the chemical potential of the gas species is lower in solution than in the free gas phase.) At the same time, the free energy of the system as a whole would be greatly reduced if most of the dissolved gas were to somehow escape from solution and collect above the liquid. (This free energy reduction is due to the fast decrease of the chemical potential of gas with a drop in pressure.) Thus, the system is in a metastable state, albeit an unusual one. Strictly speaking, this state is not an equilibrium one even locally: the increase of the solute concentration with depth causes a diffusion ?ux directed upward, which, given suf?cient time, could bring the system into the above state of minimum free energy. However, the continuous supply of methane by the rising bubbles from the sea?oor ensures that the concentration pro?le will remain nonuniform, slowly approaching the saturation one. Even if that supply were to cease, the diffusion time scales are so long that this path toward the global energy minimum can be ignored. A very fast transition from this metastable state can be triggered by disturbances that displace ?uid a ?nite distance in the vertical direction. Such disturbances may result from an earthquake, a sea?oor volcano, convection currents due to geothermal heating, or an internal gravity wave. Consider a parcel of ?uid that is displaced upward, and is now subject to lower hydrostatic pressure, to which corresponds a lower solubility value. As a result, the ?uid in the parcel is now supersaturated with the dissolved gas, which must begin to exsolve, forming tiny gas bubbles. (If the ?uid in its original position was only partially saturated, exsolution will begin after the parcel has risen through some signi?cant distance, so in this case the initial disturbance must be suf?ciently large.) The volume of the ascending parcel of ?uid increases due to the formation of bubbles, making it more buoyant and accelerating its rise; this leads to further reduction in the ambient pressure, further exsolution of gas, and further increase in the volume of the parcel. This self-accelerating motion entrains the surrounding ?uid; exsolution of the gas in the latter reinforces the motion. The result is a violent eruption (Kling et al., 1987; Zhang, 1996). From the initial eruption site, hydrodynamic disturbances propagate in all directions (via turbulent entrainment and/or internal gravity waves), triggering eruptions at other sites. Similarly to transitions from other metastable states (e.g., boiling of a superheated liquid), the eruption should spread quickly throughout the region of the ocean where the water column is saturated, or partially saturated, with gas. In spite of the low solubility of methane in seawater, the total possible increase in the buoyancy of the parcel can be large. Consider a parcel that started its rise at 4 km depth, where solubility of methane is ;4.3 3 1023 . Then, if the parcel had a volume of 18 cm3 (1 mol of water) and was saturated with methane, it contained 4.3 3 1023 mol of dissolved methane. By the time this parcel has risen to the surface, essentially all the methane in the parcel has exsolved (solubility is ;2 3 1025 at the surface). At the surface conditions (T ø 25 8C, P 5 1 bar), 1 mol of any gas occupies 25 3 10 3 cm3 , so the total volume of methane in the parcel is ;108 cm3 , and the volume of the parcel, which now contains a mist of water droplets in gaseous methane, is 126 cm3 . That is, the volume of the parcel has increased by a factor of seven. Concurrent exsolution of other dissolved gases (e.g., carbon dioxide CO2 , hydrogen sul?de H2 S) will add to the effect. A rather similar process is responsible for the most violent, explosive volcanic eruptions (called Plinian), such as eruptions of Mount Vesuvius in A.D. 79 or Mount St. Helens in 1980. These eruptions are driven by exsolution of gases (primarily water vapor) dissolved in the liquid magma. In Lake Nyos (Cameroon), CO2 of magmatic origin enters the water column from the bottom, at a depth of ;200 m. In 1986, the lake erupted, creating a gas-water fountain ;120 m in height (Zhang, 1996), and releasing a lethal cloud of CO2 . A water surge washed up the shore to a height of ;25 m. The eruption continued for several hours (Kling et al., 1987). OCEANIC ERUPTION AS A CAUSE OF MASS EXTINCTION The consequences of a methane-driven oceanic eruption for marine and terrestrial life are likely to be catastrophic. Figuratively speaking, the erupting region ’’boils over,’’ ejecting a large amount of methane and other gases (e.g., CO2 , H2 S) into the atmosphere, and ?ooding large areas of land. Whereas pure methane is lighter than air, methane loaded with water droplets is much heavier, and thus spreads over the land, mixing with air in the process (and losing water as rain). The air methane mixture is explosive at methane concentrations between 5 and 15; as such mixtures form in different locations near the ground and are ignited by lightning, explosions 2 and con?agrations destroy most of the terrestrial life, and also produce great amounts of smoke and of carbon dioxide. Firestorms carry smoke and dust into the upper atmosphere, where they may remain for several years (Turco et al., 1991); the resulting darkness and global cooling may provide an additional kill mechanism. Conversely, carbon dioxide and the remaining methane create the greenhouse effect, which may lead to global warming. The outcome of the competition between the cooling and the warming tendencies is dif?cult to predict (Turco et al., 1991; Pierrehumbert, 2002). Upon release of a signi?cant portion of the dissolved methane, the ocean settles down, and the entire sequence of events (i.e., development of anoxia, accumulation of dissolved methane, the metastable state, eruption) begins anew. No external cause is required to bring about a methane-driven eruption—its mechanism is self-contained, and implies that eruptions are likely to occur repeatedly at the same location. Because methane is isotopically light, its fast release must result in a negative carbon isotope excursion in the geological record. Knowing the magnitude of the excursion, one can estimate the amount of methane that could have produced it. Such calculations (prompted by the methane-hydrate-dissociation model, but equally applicable here) have been performed for several global events in the geological record; the results range from ;10 18 to 10 19 g of released methane (e.g., Katz et al., 1999; Kennedy et al., 2001; de Wit et al., 2002). These are very large amounts: the total carbon content of today’s terrestrial biomass is ;2 3 10 18 g. Nevertheless, relatively small regions of the deep ocean could contain such amounts of dissolved methane; e.g., the Black Sea alone (volume ;0.4 3 1023 of the ocean total; maximum depth only 2.2 km) could hold, at saturation, ;0.5 3 10 18 g. A similar region of the deep ocean could contain much more (the amount grows quadratically with depth 3 ). Released in a geological instant (weeks, perhaps), 10 18 to 10 19 g of methane could destroy the terrestrial life almost entirely. Combustion and explosion of 0.75 3 10 19 g of methane would liberate energy equivalent to 10 8 Mt of TNT, ;10,000 times greater than the world’s stockpile of nuclear weapons, implicated in the nuclearwinter scenario (Turco et al., 1991).&nbsp;</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h3 id="HContention2isCooperation-5" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Contention 2 is Cooperation</span></h3><h4 id="HScenarioOneisDrilling:-5" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Scenario One is Drilling:</span></h4><h4 id="HCubandrillingintheEasternGapisinevitable-5" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Cuban drilling in the Eastern Gap is inevitable</span></h4><p><strong>Tamayo ’13</strong><br/>(Juan – Writer at The Miami Herald.

Consider for clarity the case when the concentration of the dissolved gas is only slightly below saturation throughout, and thus increases downward in accordance with Henry’s law. Then locally there is no tendency for the dissolved gas to exsolve (to form bubbles), in spite of the fact that nuclei are abundant in seawater. (Exsolution would lead to a slight increase in free energy: below saturation, the chemical potential of the gas species is lower in solution than in the free gas phase.) At the same time, the free energy of the system as a whole would be greatly reduced if most of the dissolved gas were to somehow escape from solution and collect above the liquid. (This free energy reduction is due to the fast decrease of the chemical potential of gas with a drop in pressure.) Thus, the system is in a metastable state, albeit an unusual one. Strictly speaking, this state is not an equilibrium one even locally: the increase of the solute concentration with depth causes a diffusion ?ux directed upward, which, given suf?cient time, could bring the system into the above state of minimum free energy. However, the continuous supply of methane by the rising bubbles from the sea?oor ensures that the concentration pro?le will remain nonuniform, slowly approaching the saturation one. Even if that supply were to cease, the diffusion time scales are so long that this path toward the global energy minimum can be ignored. A very fast transition from this metastable state can be triggered by disturbances that displace ?uid a ?nite distance in the vertical direction. Such disturbances may result from an earthquake, a sea?oor volcano, convection currents due to geothermal heating, or an internal gravity wave. Consider a parcel of ?uid that is displaced upward, and is now subject to lower hydrostatic pressure, to which corresponds a lower solubility value. As a result, the ?uid in the parcel is now supersaturated with the dissolved gas, which must begin to exsolve, forming tiny gas bubbles. (If the ?uid in its original position was only partially saturated, exsolution will begin after the parcel has risen through some signi?cant distance, so in this case the initial disturbance must be suf?ciently large.) The volume of the ascending parcel of ?uid increases due to the formation of bubbles, making it more buoyant and accelerating its rise; this leads to further reduction in the ambient pressure, further exsolution of gas, and further increase in the volume of the parcel. This self-accelerating motion entrains the surrounding ?uid; exsolution of the gas in the latter reinforces the motion. The result is a violent eruption (Kling et al., 1987; Zhang, 1996). From the initial eruption site, hydrodynamic disturbances propagate in all directions (via turbulent entrainment and/or internal gravity waves), triggering eruptions at other sites. Similarly to transitions from other metastable states (e.g., boiling of a superheated liquid), the eruption should spread quickly throughout the region of the ocean where the water column is saturated, or partially saturated, with gas. In spite of the low solubility of methane in seawater, the total possible increase in the buoyancy of the parcel can be large. Consider a parcel that started its rise at 4 km depth, where solubility of methane is ;4.3 3 1023 . Then, if the parcel had a volume of 18 cm3 (1 mol of water) and was saturated with methane, it contained 4.3 3 1023 mol of dissolved methane. By the time this parcel has risen to the surface, essentially all the methane in the parcel has exsolved (solubility is ;2 3 1025 at the surface). At the surface conditions (T ø 25 8C, P 5 1 bar), 1 mol of any gas occupies 25 3 10 3 cm3 , so the total volume of methane in the parcel is ;108 cm3 , and the volume of the parcel, which now contains a mist of water droplets in gaseous methane, is 126 cm3 . That is, the volume of the parcel has increased by a factor of seven. Concurrent exsolution of other dissolved gases (e.g., carbon dioxide CO2 , hydrogen sul?de H2 S) will add to the effect. A rather similar process is responsible for the most violent, explosive volcanic eruptions (called Plinian), such as eruptions of Mount Vesuvius in A.D. 79 or Mount St. Helens in 1980. These eruptions are driven by exsolution of gases (primarily water vapor) dissolved in the liquid magma. In Lake Nyos (Cameroon), CO2 of magmatic origin enters the water column from the bottom, at a depth of ;200 m. In 1986, the lake erupted, creating a gas-water fountain ;120 m in height (Zhang, 1996), and releasing a lethal cloud of CO2 . A water surge washed up the shore to a height of ;25 m. The eruption continued for several hours (Kling et al., 1987). OCEANIC ERUPTION AS A CAUSE OF MASS EXTINCTION The consequences of a methane-driven oceanic eruption for marine and terrestrial life are likely to be catastrophic. Figuratively speaking, the erupting region ’’boils over,’’ ejecting a large amount of methane and other gases (e.g., CO2 , H2 S) into the atmosphere, and ?ooding large areas of land. Whereas pure methane is lighter than air, methane loaded with water droplets is much heavier, and thus spreads over the land, mixing with air in the process (and losing water as rain). The air methane mixture is explosive at methane concentrations between 5 and 15; as such mixtures form in different locations near the ground and are ignited by lightning, explosions 2 and con?agrations destroy most of the terrestrial life, and also produce great amounts of smoke and of carbon dioxide. Firestorms carry smoke and dust into the upper atmosphere, where they may remain for several years (Turco et al., 1991); the resulting darkness and global cooling may provide an additional kill mechanism. Conversely, carbon dioxide and the remaining methane create the greenhouse effect, which may lead to global warming. The outcome of the competition between the cooling and the warming tendencies is dif?cult to predict (Turco et al., 1991; Pierrehumbert, 2002). Upon release of a signi?cant portion of the dissolved methane, the ocean settles down, and the entire sequence of events (i.e., development of anoxia, accumulation of dissolved methane, the metastable state, eruption) begins anew. No external cause is required to bring about a methane-driven eruption—its mechanism is self-contained, and implies that eruptions are likely to occur repeatedly at the same location. Because methane is isotopically light, its fast release must result in a negative carbon isotope excursion in the geological record. Knowing the magnitude of the excursion, one can estimate the amount of methane that could have produced it. Such calculations (prompted by the methane-hydrate-dissociation model, but equally applicable here) have been performed for several global events in the geological record; the results range from ;10 18 to 10 19 g of released methane (e.g., Katz et al., 1999; Kennedy et al., 2001; de Wit et al., 2002). These are very large amounts: the total carbon content of today’s terrestrial biomass is ;2 3 10 18 g. Nevertheless, relatively small regions of the deep ocean could contain such amounts of dissolved methane; e.g., the Black Sea alone (volume ;0.4 3 1023 of the ocean total; maximum depth only 2.2 km) could hold, at saturation, ;0.5 3 10 18 g. A similar region of the deep ocean could contain much more (the amount grows quadratically with depth 3 ). Released in a geological instant (weeks, perhaps), 10 18 to 10 19 g of methane could destroy the terrestrial life almost entirely. Combustion and explosion of 0.75 3 10 19 g of methane would liberate energy equivalent to 10 8 Mt of TNT, ;10,000 times greater than the world’s stockpile of nuclear weapons, implicated in the nuclearwinter scenario (Turco et al., 1991).&nbsp;</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h3 id="HContention2isCooperation-7" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Contention 2 is Cooperation</span></h3><h4 id="HScenarioOneisDrilling:-7" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Scenario One is Drilling:</span></h4><h4 id="HCubandrillingintheEasternGapisinevitable-10" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Cuban drilling in the Eastern Gap is inevitable</span></h4><p><strong>Tamayo ’13</strong><br/>(Juan – Writer at The Miami Herald.

Consider for clarity the case when the concentration of the dissolved gas is only slightly below saturation throughout, and thus increases downward in accordance with Henry’s law. Then locally there is no tendency for the dissolved gas to exsolve (to form bubbles), in spite of the fact that nuclei are abundant in seawater. (Exsolution would lead to a slight increase in free energy: below saturation, the chemical potential of the gas species is lower in solution than in the free gas phase.) At the same time, the free energy of the system as a whole would be greatly reduced if most of the dissolved gas were to somehow escape from solution and collect above the liquid. (This free energy reduction is due to the fast decrease of the chemical potential of gas with a drop in pressure.) Thus, the system is in a metastable state, albeit an unusual one. Strictly speaking, this state is not an equilibrium one even locally: the increase of the solute concentration with depth causes a diffusion ?ux directed upward, which, given suf?cient time, could bring the system into the above state of minimum free energy. However, the continuous supply of methane by the rising bubbles from the sea?oor ensures that the concentration pro?le will remain nonuniform, slowly approaching the saturation one. Even if that supply were to cease, the diffusion time scales are so long that this path toward the global energy minimum can be ignored. A very fast transition from this metastable state can be triggered by disturbances that displace ?uid a ?nite distance in the vertical direction. Such disturbances may result from an earthquake, a sea?oor volcano, convection currents due to geothermal heating, or an internal gravity wave. Consider a parcel of ?uid that is displaced upward, and is now subject to lower hydrostatic pressure, to which corresponds a lower solubility value. As a result, the ?uid in the parcel is now supersaturated with the dissolved gas, which must begin to exsolve, forming tiny gas bubbles. (If the ?uid in its original position was only partially saturated, exsolution will begin after the parcel has risen through some signi?cant distance, so in this case the initial disturbance must be suf?ciently large.) The volume of the ascending parcel of ?uid increases due to the formation of bubbles, making it more buoyant and accelerating its rise; this leads to further reduction in the ambient pressure, further exsolution of gas, and further increase in the volume of the parcel. This self-accelerating motion entrains the surrounding ?uid; exsolution of the gas in the latter reinforces the motion. The result is a violent eruption (Kling et al., 1987; Zhang, 1996). From the initial eruption site, hydrodynamic disturbances propagate in all directions (via turbulent entrainment and/or internal gravity waves), triggering eruptions at other sites. Similarly to transitions from other metastable states (e.g., boiling of a superheated liquid), the eruption should spread quickly throughout the region of the ocean where the water column is saturated, or partially saturated, with gas. In spite of the low solubility of methane in seawater, the total possible increase in the buoyancy of the parcel can be large. Consider a parcel that started its rise at 4 km depth, where solubility of methane is ;4.3 3 1023 . Then, if the parcel had a volume of 18 cm3 (1 mol of water) and was saturated with methane, it contained 4.3 3 1023 mol of dissolved methane. By the time this parcel has risen to the surface, essentially all the methane in the parcel has exsolved (solubility is ;2 3 1025 at the surface). At the surface conditions (T ø 25 8C, P 5 1 bar), 1 mol of any gas occupies 25 3 10 3 cm3 , so the total volume of methane in the parcel is ;108 cm3 , and the volume of the parcel, which now contains a mist of water droplets in gaseous methane, is 126 cm3 . That is, the volume of the parcel has increased by a factor of seven. Concurrent exsolution of other dissolved gases (e.g., carbon dioxide CO2 , hydrogen sul?de H2 S) will add to the effect. A rather similar process is responsible for the most violent, explosive volcanic eruptions (called Plinian), such as eruptions of Mount Vesuvius in A.D. 79 or Mount St. Helens in 1980. These eruptions are driven by exsolution of gases (primarily water vapor) dissolved in the liquid magma. In Lake Nyos (Cameroon), CO2 of magmatic origin enters the water column from the bottom, at a depth of ;200 m. In 1986, the lake erupted, creating a gas-water fountain ;120 m in height (Zhang, 1996), and releasing a lethal cloud of CO2 . A water surge washed up the shore to a height of ;25 m. The eruption continued for several hours (Kling et al., 1987). OCEANIC ERUPTION AS A CAUSE OF MASS EXTINCTION The consequences of a methane-driven oceanic eruption for marine and terrestrial life are likely to be catastrophic. Figuratively speaking, the erupting region ’’boils over,’’ ejecting a large amount of methane and other gases (e.g., CO2 , H2 S) into the atmosphere, and ?ooding large areas of land. Whereas pure methane is lighter than air, methane loaded with water droplets is much heavier, and thus spreads over the land, mixing with air in the process (and losing water as rain). The air methane mixture is explosive at methane concentrations between 5 and 15; as such mixtures form in different locations near the ground and are ignited by lightning, explosions 2 and con?agrations destroy most of the terrestrial life, and also produce great amounts of smoke and of carbon dioxide. Firestorms carry smoke and dust into the upper atmosphere, where they may remain for several years (Turco et al., 1991); the resulting darkness and global cooling may provide an additional kill mechanism. Conversely, carbon dioxide and the remaining methane create the greenhouse effect, which may lead to global warming. The outcome of the competition between the cooling and the warming tendencies is dif?cult to predict (Turco et al., 1991; Pierrehumbert, 2002). Upon release of a signi?cant portion of the dissolved methane, the ocean settles down, and the entire sequence of events (i.e., development of anoxia, accumulation of dissolved methane, the metastable state, eruption) begins anew. No external cause is required to bring about a methane-driven eruption—its mechanism is self-contained, and implies that eruptions are likely to occur repeatedly at the same location. Because methane is isotopically light, its fast release must result in a negative carbon isotope excursion in the geological record. Knowing the magnitude of the excursion, one can estimate the amount of methane that could have produced it. Such calculations (prompted by the methane-hydrate-dissociation model, but equally applicable here) have been performed for several global events in the geological record; the results range from ;10 18 to 10 19 g of released methane (e.g., Katz et al., 1999; Kennedy et al., 2001; de Wit et al., 2002). These are very large amounts: the total carbon content of today’s terrestrial biomass is ;2 3 10 18 g. Nevertheless, relatively small regions of the deep ocean could contain such amounts of dissolved methane; e.g., the Black Sea alone (volume ;0.4 3 1023 of the ocean total; maximum depth only 2.2 km) could hold, at saturation, ;0.5 3 10 18 g. A similar region of the deep ocean could contain much more (the amount grows quadratically with depth 3 ). Released in a geological instant (weeks, perhaps), 10 18 to 10 19 g of methane could destroy the terrestrial life almost entirely. Combustion and explosion of 0.75 3 10 19 g of methane would liberate energy equivalent to 10 8 Mt of TNT, ;10,000 times greater than the world’s stockpile of nuclear weapons, implicated in the nuclearwinter scenario (Turco et al., 1991).&nbsp;</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h3 id="HContention2isCooperation-8" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Contention 2 is Cooperation</span></h3><h4 id="HScenarioOneisDrilling:-8" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Scenario One is Drilling:</span></h4><h4 id="HCubandrillingintheEasternGapisinevitable-11" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Cuban drilling in the Eastern Gap is inevitable</span></h4><p><strong>Tamayo ’13</strong><br/>(Juan – Writer at The Miami Herald.
