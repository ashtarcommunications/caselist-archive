The only laws in economics are the laws of physics, everything else is contingent, supposition or vanity. An economy, growing in size and complexity, is firstly a thermodynamic system requiring increasing energy flows to grow and avoid decay. Waste, be it greenhouse gasses or landfill is also a natural outcome of such a thermodynamic process.<br/>News from Elsewhere<br/>It’s been part of the background noise for over half a century, warnings about <br/>AND<br/>crazy despots have always demanded our attention, at least while on TV.<br/>Yes we can21 Yes we can21 - chanted the posse of teenagers following Al Gore through a pavilion in Poznan, Poland for the annual gathering of climate policy acronyms.<br/>When not distracted by the ever-present, we’ve responded to these warnings with <br/>AND<br/>and environmental sink demands keep increasing, ecological indicators decline and inequality rises.<br/>The reality is that we are locked into an economy adapted to growth, and <br/>AND<br/>to greater poverty, and pose even greater risks to the banking system.<br/>It is an oxymoron to say we can do something unsustainable forever. How would <br/>AND<br/>age, confirming the earth centric universe against Galileo and Copernicus before him.<br/>What the Galileos of today are saying is that we are at or near the <br/>AND<br/>fall, and our visions will fall further and further from our grasp.<br/>They are saying that global food production is hitting an array of ecological constraints, while population growth and changing diets are driving up demand. They note that current food production is massively subsidised through fossil fuel inputs, and that as those inputs become less available, and people become poorer due to economic contraction, food productivity and access will be undermined.<br/>In totality, we are at the edge of an evolving systemic crisis. Peak oil and food constraints are likely to undermine the stability of our integrated globalised economy. The core pillars of that economy: critical infrastructure, production flows, economies of scale, the financial and monetary system, behavioural adaptation, resource access and energy flows-are likely to begin forcing contagious failure.<br/>The driving force of this failure is likely to be the fastest and most unstable process-the impact of energy and food constrained economic growth, and an already vulnerable monetary and financial system dependent upon continuing growth.<br/>Tightening binds<br/>Whatever of Ireland’s economic woes, the real debt bubble is global. The debt relative to GDP is far greater now in the US, UK, and much of Europe, than it ever was leading up to the great depression. Like many countries we responded to our debt bubble with more debt, we just shifted it onto the sovereign or the printing press.<br/>The indebted world, even without oil and food price rises is straining at the limits of debt servicing and credibility. Yet it is demanding even more credit, while its ability to service the debt is being undermined by debt deflation, austerity, rising job losses, and defaults. The bank lenders of that money can only lose so much before they are too are insolvent.<br/>Rising food and energy prices are driving the deflationary forces even harder. And if central banks misinterpret the cause of food and oil price rises, and raise interest rates, the deflationary pressures risk becoming cyclonic. The cost of essentials and debt servicing rise, while income declines. Discretionary spending will collapse, job losses and defaults rise, income will declines further. This re-enforcing spiral of decline will increase, and spread to more and more countries.<br/>The fear of contagion from peripheral Eurozone defaults are not merely that they could topple <br/>AND<br/>they are shown to have values far below what is required for solvency.<br/>What everybody wants and needs is a sudden and explosive increase in the production of real goods and services (GDP) to make their continual debt requirements serviceable. But that,even were it remotely possible, would require a big increase in oil flows through the global economy, just as global oil production has peaked and begins its decline. It cannot happen. This means that the global financial system is essentially insolvent now.<br/>The only choice is default or inflation on a global scale. It mean banks <br/>AND<br/>on fiat money, fractional reserve banking, and interest can only collapse.<br/>High oil and food prices are essentially probing the limits of the stability of the globalised economy. They will probe until there is a major collapse in global economic production. At which point our energy prices may fall, but our real income and purchasing power will fall faster.<br/>And markets will discover this truth quicker than monetary authorities and governments. Its expression will be in deeper and deeper economic stresses and major systemic banking collapses. Official responses will become more and more impotent, as their fundamental economic and policy tools no longer work, and their patina of control becomes hollow. If and when banking system contagion spreads to supply-chain contagion we may face existential challenges.<br/>Even were we to have the perfect monetary and financial system, without debt and <br/>AND<br/>for various reasons, and monetary instability would still destabilise supply-chains.<br/>Facing Ourselves 26 Facing Our Future<br/>We are at the beginning of a process in which our world-views crash against a fundamentally unstable financial system and ecological constraints. A time where we will learn that what was, will never return; and what was expected, can never be. We are facing a time of loss and uncertainty. A time of bank-runs, lost savings and pensions, of mass unemployment, electricity and mobile phone black-outs, of hunger and empty super-market shelves.<br/>A localised economy will no longer be something environmentalists aspire to develop; rather it will be forced upon us as bank failures, monetary uncertainty, and lost purchasing power sever links in the web of the global economy. But we no longer have indigenous economies to fall back upon.<br/>The gap between expectations and what can be realised is historically a major source of popular anger, and can ignite a cycle of fear, blame, violence, scape-goating, and authoritarian leadership from either left or right. It can give the avaricious the power and cover to appropriate wealth that might better be used for collective welfare.<br/>Yet who gave us the right to our expectations? They were built on the <br/>AND<br/>the delusion that we are the displaced God who transcended our own ecology.<br/>Yes, we can and will build a largely local economy out of the ruins of a collapsed globalised one. It will be a much poorer one and one where we will have lost much of what we take for granted. It can also provide a good life, where our basic needs are met, where meaningful lives can be lived, and a rich texture of experience found.</p><h4 id="HEvenmassiveeconomicdeclinehaszerochanceofwar" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Even massive economic decline has zero chance of war</span></h4><p>Robert <strong>Jervis 11</strong>, Professor in the Department of Political Science and School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University, December 2011, "Force in Our Times," Survival, Vol. 25, No. 4, p. 403-425<br/>Even if war is still seen as evil, the security community could be dissolved <br/>AND<br/>times bring about greater economic conflict, it will not make war thinkable.</p><h4 id="HGrowthmakeseco-collapseinevitable" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Growth makes eco-collapse inevitable</span></h4><p>Speth, law prof, 8—Served as President Jimmy Carter’s White House environmental <br/>AND<br/>, and Crossing from Crisis to Sustainability, Gigapedia, 6-9)</p><p>But the much larger and more threatening impacts stem from the economic activity of those <br/>AND<br/>modern capitalism, in each case seeking to identify the transformative changes needed.&nbsp;</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HExtinction" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Extinction</span></h4><p>Chen 2k—Professor of Law and Vance K.

Should the president deal with an international crisis through military invasion or diplomacy? How should the U.S. Congress act to address illegal immigration?<br/>Is the defendant guilty as accused? Tlie Daily Show or the ball game? <br/>AND<br/>do we sort through it and select the best information for our needs?<br/>The ability of every decision maker to make good, reasoned, and ethical decisions relies heavily upon their ability to think critically. Critical thinking enables one to break argumentation down to its component parts in order to evaluate its relative validity and strength. Critical thinkers are better users of information, as well as better advocates.<br/>Colleges and universities expect their students to develop their critical thinking skills and may require students to take designated courses to that end. The importance and value of such study is widely recognized.<br/>Much of the most significant communication of our lives is conducted in the form of debates. These may take place in intrapersonal communications, in which we weigh the pros and cons of an important decision in our own minds, or they may take place in interpersonal communications, in which we listen to arguments intended to influence our decision or participate in exchanges to influence the decisions of others.<br/>Our success or failure in life is largely determined by our ability to make wise <br/>AND<br/>customer for out product, or a vote for our favored political candidate.</strong></p><p><strong>And independently a voting issue for limits and ground—-our entire negative strategy is based on the "should" question of the resolution—-there are an infinite number of reasons that the scholarship of their advocacy could be a reason to vote affirmative—- these all obviate the only predictable strategies based on topical action—-they overstretch our research burden and undermine preparedness for all debates</strong></p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h2 id="HKawaii" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Kawaii</span></h2><h4 id="HTheirsubjugationoftheSelftotheOtherprecludesthepossibilityofethicsandrefusestorecognizedichotomiesthatarekeytoactualequality" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Their subjugation of the Self to the Other precludes the possibility of ethics and refuses to recognize dichotomies that are key to actual equality</span></h4><p>Prozorov 6 (Sergei, Professor of International Relations at Petrozavodsk State University, Russia, "Liberal Enmity: The Figure of the Foe in the Political Ontology of Liberalism," Millenium Vol 35 no 1, December 2006, 75-99, dml)<br/>What interests us in this modality of the friend–enemy distinction is the explicit <br/>AND<br/>, or, in Schmitt’s terms, an inimicus rather than a hostis.</p><h4 id="HThealternativeistoaffirmpluralisticsociety2013refusetheirattempttoimposedominancethroughacceptingtheexistenceofenemieswhoaredifferentfromus2013afailuretoaffirmthesedistinctionscreatesthepreconditionsforendlessviolencethroughtheforcefulinclusionoftheOtherintotheglobalsocietytheytrytocreate." class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>The alternative is to affirm pluralistic society – refuse their attempt to impose dominance through accepting the existence of enemies who are different from us – a failure to affirm these distinctions creates the preconditions for endless violence through the forceful inclusion of the Other into the global society they try to create.</span></h4><p>Prozorov 6 (Sergei, Professor of International Relations at Petrozavodsk State University, Russia, "Liberal Enmity: The Figure of the Foe in the Political Ontology of Liberalism," Millenium Vol 35 no 1, December 2006, 75-99, dml)<br/>Schmitt’s deconstruction of liberal universalism focuses on the concept of humanity that is crucial in <br/>AND<br/>opposite or perhaps reveals its own essence in the guise of its antithesis.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h2 id="HSpaceJam" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Space Jam</span></h2><h4 id="HSocialservicepoliciesareanendinitself-aslongaswepursuehumanitarianefforts2Cwesustainthecapitalistsystemthatimpoverishedthosepeopleinthefirstplace" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Social service policies are an end in itself- as long as we pursue humanitarian efforts, we sustain the capitalist system that impoverished those people in the first place</span></h4><p><strong>Zizek, 08-</strong> Senior Researcher at the Institute for Social Studies, Ljubljana (Slavoj, Violence, p 20-24)<br/>Above all, liberal communists are true citizens of the world.

April 1989. "On Shunning Undesirable Regimes: Ethics and Economic Sanctions." Public Affairs Quarterly, April, vol. 3, no. 2)</p><p>A fundamental task of morality is resolving conflicting interests. If we both want the same piece of land, ethics provides a basis for resolving the conflict by identifying "mine" and "thine." If in anger 1 want to smash your face, ethics indicates that your face’s being unsmashed is a legitimate interest of yours which takes precedence over my own interest in expressing my rage. Thus ethics identifies the rights of individuals when their interests conflict.<br/>But how can a case for shunning be made on this view of morality? <br/>AND<br/>, on what grounds might it be a duty to impose such sanctions’?<br/>We find the answer when we note that there is another "level" of <br/>AND<br/>rights of others with one’s actions but also to support that moral order.<br/>Consider that the moral order itself contributes significantly to people’s rights being respected. It <br/>AND<br/>. Certain types of behavior constitute a direct attack on the moral order.<br/>When the violation of human rights is flagrant, willful, and persistent, the offender is, as it were, thumbing her nose at the moral order, publicly rejecting it as binding her behavior. Clearly such behavior, if tolerated by society, will weaken and perhaps eventually undermine altogether the moral order. Let us look briefly at those three conditions which turn immoral behavior into an attack on the moral order.<br/>An immoral action is flagrant if it is "extremely or deliberately conspicuous; notorious<br/>AND<br/>reaffirms the legitimacy of that moral order. How does shunning do this? <br/>First, by refusing publicly to have to do with such a person one announces support for the moral order and backs up the announcement with action. This action reinforces the commitment to the moral order both of the shunner and of the other members of the community. (Secretary of State Shultz in effect made this argument in his caB for international sanctions on Libya in the early days of 1986.). .<br/>Further, shunning may have a moral effect on the shunned person, even if the direct impact is not adequate to change the immoral behavior. If the shunned person thinks of herself as part of the moral community, shunning may well make clear to her that she is, in fact, removing herself from that community by the behavior in question. Thus shunning may achieve by moral suasion what cannot be achieved by "force."<br/>Finally, shunning may be a form of punishment, of moral sanction, whose appropriateness depends not on whether it will change the person’s behavior, but on whether he deserves the punishment for violating the moral order.<br/>Punishment than can be viewed as a way of maintaining the moral order, of "purifying the community" after it has been made "unclean," as ancient communities might have put it.</p><h3 id="HAlloys" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Alloys</span></h3><h4 id="HSquosolves2013researchmakesdomestictetraenitescommerciallyviable" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Squo solves – research makes domestic tetraenites commercially viable</span></h4><p><strong>Phys, 12 – Citing several experts ("Team to develop supermagnets using materials that mimic iron-nickel found in meteorites," 12 December 2013, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://phys.org/news/2012-12-team-supermagnets-materials-mimic-iron-nickel.html)//HO**  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://phys.org/news/2012-12-team-supermagnets-materials-mimic-iron-nickel.html)//HO**%27" tppabs="http://phys.org/news/2012-12-team-supermagnets-materials-mimic-iron-nickel.html)//HO**"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://phys.org/news/2012-12-team-supermagnets-materials-mimic-iron-nickel.html)//HO**</span></a></span><br/>Joseph Goldstein, an engineering professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, is part <br/>AND<br/>The UMass Amherst share of the grant is approximately 24300,000.<br/>Researchers are looking for a way to realign the crystalline structure of inexpensive iron and nickel, metals found abundantly on Earth into a new structure, FeNi known as tetrataenite, which has the super-magnetic properties they seek.

The news was remarkable simply for being so unremarkable. No parades in Miami or demonstrations in Havana. No violence. Just an announcement: In 2018, Raul would turn over the reins of power.<br/>Oh, and everyone after Castro would face term limits. Go figure.<br/>After maintaining a stranglehold on Cuba for almost 60 years, the longest-running dictatorship in the world will cease to exist. It isn’t happening at the point of a bayonet or from a popular uprising, but rather because of time. When Raul steps down, Fidel will be approaching 92 and Raul 87.<br/>The man the Castros have chosen as successor is newly appointed Vice President Miguel Diaz-Canel. Diaz-Canel is seen as an effective manager and a steady though unspectacular mover in Cuba’s Communist Party. A career communist. Because of that, the speculation is that not much change will occur.<br/>But remember, the same was said of Mikhail Gorbachev when he took control of the Soviet Union.<br/>In a country defined by The Revolution, the impact of having a leader who is from the post-Revolution generation cannot be overstated. Diaz-Canel’s generation, which has grown up in the lean times of the embargo era, is more pragmatic and open to change.<br/>If the plan goes as scripted (past "successors," after all, simply disappeared from the political scene after being anointed), this could also be a great opportunity for the United States. The U.S.-led embargo of Cuba, which was started the same year that Diaz-Canel was born, 1960, and tightened in 1962 by then-President John F. Kennedy, has been devastating. Cuban diplomats claim it has cost their country 241 trillion since 1962.<br/>It has also been a black eye internationally for the U.S. In 2010, a Cuba-backed resolution asking for an end to the embargo passed the United Nations, 185-2.<br/>Once new leadership is in place, the U.S. should reconsider its position on the embargo.</p><h4 id="HSlowchangekeytoCubanreform-avoidsrapidregimecollapse" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Slow change key to Cuban reform - avoids rapid regime collapse</span></h4><p><strong>Feinberg 11</strong> - professor of international political economy at UC San Dieg, nonresident senior fellow with the Latin America Initiative at Brookings (Richard E., "Reaching Out: Cuba’s New Economy and the International Response", November, Brookings, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.brookings.edu/~~/media/research/files/papers/2011/11/1820cuba20feinberg/1118_cuba_feinberg.pdf)//ID-http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2011/11/18  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path excluded from retrieval by the project\%27s Exclusions properties.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.brookings.edu/~~/media/research/files/papers/2011/11/1820cuba20feinberg/1118_cuba_feinberg.pdf)//ID-http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2011/11/18%27" tppabs="http://www.brookings.edu/~~/media/research/files/papers/2011/11/1820cuba20feinberg/1118_cuba_feinberg.pdf)//ID-http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2011/11/18"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.brookings.edu/~~/media/research/files/papers/2011/11/1820cuba20feinberg/1118_cuba_feinberg.pdf)//ID-http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2011/11/18</span></a></span> cuba feinberg/1118_cuba_feinberg.pdf)<em>ID&nbsp;</em></p><p>Gradualism: Gradualism in economic reform—as opposed to an Eastern European-style <br/>AND<br/>policy paralysis or a smoke-screen for maintenance of the status quo.</p><h4 id="HRapidchangerisksCubancivilwar2013turnstheaff" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Rapid change risks Cuban civil war – turns the aff</span></h4><p><strong>Feinberg 11</strong> - professor of international political economy at UC San Dieg, nonresident senior fellow with the Latin America Initiative at Brookings (Richard E., "Reaching Out: Cuba’s New Economy and the International Response", November, Brookings, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.brookings.edu/~~/media/research/files/papers/2011/11/1820cuba20feinberg/1118_cuba_feinberg.pdf-http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2011/11/18  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path excluded from retrieval by the project\%27s Exclusions properties.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.brookings.edu/~~/media/research/files/papers/2011/11/1820cuba20feinberg/1118_cuba_feinberg.pdf-http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2011/11/18%27" tppabs="http://www.brookings.edu/~~/media/research/files/papers/2011/11/1820cuba20feinberg/1118_cuba_feinberg.pdf-http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2011/11/18"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.brookings.edu/~~/media/research/files/papers/2011/11/1820cuba20feinberg/1118_cuba_feinberg.pdf-http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2011/11/18</span></a></span> cuba feinberg/1118_cuba_feinberg.pdf)<em>ID<br/>Some in the United States have long supported severe sanctions &nbsp;intended to starve the Cuban <br/>AND<br/>to quell a bloody civil &nbsp;war and halt a mass exodus of refugees.<br/>China has no reason to attack Taiwan<br/>Allison 26 Blackwill 13 — *director of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs and Douglas Dillon Professor at Harvard’s John F.

Interpretation - Engagement is the attempt to influence the political behavior of a state by increasing contacts with that state – economic engagement means using exclusively economic contacts like trade, loans and grants<br/>Resnik, 1 – Assistant Professor of Political Science at Yeshiva University (Evan, Journal of International Affairs, "Defining Engagement" v54, n2, political science complete)</p><p>A REFINED DEFINITION OF ENGAGEMENT<br/>In order to establish a more effective framework for dealing with unsavory regimes, I propose that we define engagement as the attempt to influence the political behavior of a target state through the comprehensive establishment and enhancement of contacts with that state across multiple issue-areas (i.e. diplomatic, military, economic, cultural). The following is a brief list of the specific forms that such contacts might include:<br/>DIPLOMATIC CONTACTS<br/>Extension of diplomatic recognition; normalization of diplomatic relations<br/>Promotion of target-state membership in international institutions and regimes<br/>Summit meetings and other visits by the head of state and other senior government officials of sender state to target state and vice-versa<br/>MILITARY CONTACTS<br/>Visits of senior military officials of the sender state to the target state and vice-versa<br/>Arms transfers<br/>Military aid and cooperation<br/>Military exchange and training programs<br/>Confidence and security-building measures<br/>Intelligence sharing<br/>ECONOMIC CONTACTS<br/>Trade agreements and promotion<br/>Foreign economic and humanitarian aid in the form of loans and/or grants<br/>CULTURAL CONTACTS<br/>Cultural treaties<br/>Inauguration of travel and tourism links<br/>Sport, artistic and academic exchanges(n25)<br/>Engagement is an iterated process in which the sender and target state develop a relationship <br/>AND<br/>hope that this will precipitate political change from below within the target state.<br/>This definition implies that three necessary conditions must hold for engagement to constitute an effective <br/>AND<br/>, and the near-total collapse of its national economy.(n28)<br/>Third, the target state must perceive the engager and the international order it represents as a potential source of the material or prestige resources it desires. This means that autarkic, revolutionary and unlimited regimes which eschew the norms and institutions of the prevailing order, such as Stalin’s Soviet Union or Hitler’s Germany, will not be seduced by the potential benefits of engagement.<br/>This reformulated conceptualization avoids the pitfalls of prevailing scholarly conceptions of engagement. It considers the policy as a set of means rather than ends, does not delimit the types of states that can either engage or be engaged, explicitly encompasses contacts in multiple issue-areas, allows for the existence of multiple objectives in any given instance of engagement and, as will be shown below, permits the elucidation of multiple types of positive sanctions.</p><p>B.

Some of the risks of molecular nanotechnology (MNT) are potentially global in scope. At least one of the sources of risk, the possibility of a nanotech arms race, is explicitly international. Even well-intentioned and well-policed nations cannot always prevent internal terrorism, and companies with strong financial incentive do not always design secure products. Each additional MNT program increases the risk that unrestricted molecular manufacturing will fall into the wrong hands. For all these reasons, it seems best to have a single, trustworthy, international administration imposing tight controls on the technology. However, unless the technology is made widely available for a wide variety of applications and purposes, there will be strong incentive for independent MNT programs. Any successful administration program must satisfy many competing interests. Nanotech problems and nanotech solutions are international. Both nanotech problems and nanotech solutions are international. If MNT goes wrong, some of its problems may be global in scope. Grey goo and military nanobots will not respect national borders. Economic collapse of any large nation will shake all the rest. Likewise, MNT risk prevention must also be global. Programs and policies for reducing poverty must be international. Administration to detect and prevent rogue MNT programs must have global jurisdiction. An accretion of national programs may be able to mitigate some problems and risks, but cannot address all of them. International policies, and international bodies, must be designed and created before molecular manufacturing arrives. Nanotech arms races can only be prevented internationally. Conflict between nations killed millions in the last century. MNT-based conflict could be even worse. Nations attack when they feel threatened by others, or to satisfy internal political pressures including desperate domestic conditions. As discussed on our Dangers page, molecular manufacturing can easily lead to an unstable arms race—a very threatening situation. Even nations that are ostensibly allies may be uneasy about each other’s ultimate intentions, and there are many combinations of powerful nations that maintain at best an uneasy truce. Unless nations can find some basis for trusting that MNT won’t be used against them in unexpected ways, they will have no choice but to develop defensive, and probably offensive, nanotechnology. International MNT arms control, with strict and trustworthy verification, appears to be the best alternative. Internal politics may drive a nation to war even when this is not a wise course. A nation that is starving may go to war out of desperation, or a single war-minded leader can drag a nation into a pattern of conflict and conquest. MNT can help with one of these problems—the technology can be deployed far faster than humans reproduce, and can alleviate material shortages for at least a few generations. Bad leaders cannot be prevented by technology, but again, the best way of dealing with such situations appears to be an international institution that protects each nation from each other. It will require careful design to implement a system that nations can trust enough not to engage in ultimately suicidal arms races on a national level. But without such a system, arms races and eventual conflict are far too likely. Preventing rogue nanotech requires international effort and cooperation. Unrestricted molecular manufacturing is far too risky, but useful restrictions will require international cooperation. With millions of criminals and thousands of terrorists in the world, immense damage could be done to people and to society. Hackers, even without intending harm, could create a self-replicating device that could do billions of dollars of damage—as software worms and viruses have done. Unfortunately, creating and maintaining useful restrictions is a huge job. Companies with strong incentive to protect their intellectual property have failed. The DVD standard, eBook format, audio watermarking, WAP, and at least one cell phone encryption system have been cracked. A multiplicity of security systems only multiplies the chance that one of them will be broken, removing all restrictions on the technology. The safest course appears to be a single security infrastructure, designed and implemented with a maximum of scrutiny from military, commercial, and private experts, applied to all nanotechnology that could be used to create unrestricted molecular manufacturing systems. A lot would be riding on this system: international arms control, commercial intellectual property control, and the continued ability to innovate without creating unacceptable risk. In the broader picture, independent or rogue nanotechnology programs would have to be discovered and prevented. This requires a body with global jurisdiction, perhaps analogous to the International Atomic Energy Agency.&nbsp;</p><h3 id="HCase-1" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Case</span></h3><h4 id="HNoimpact2013toofarinthefutureandcan2019tpredictrisks" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>No impact – too far in the future and can’t predict risks</span></h4><p>Litton, 7<br/>~Paul, Associate Professor of Law at University of Missouri, PhD (2003), University of Pennsylvania JD (1999), University of Pennsylvania Law School ’ "Nanoethics"?

Some nations <br/>AND<br/>policies that promote oligopolistic corporate control over agriculture and to promote food sovereignty.<br/>In conjunction with these movements, Cuba has made remarkable strides toward establishing a system of food sovereignty. One of their most notable projects in this regard is their institutionalized and organized effort to expand agroecological practices, or a system of agriculture that is based on ecological principles and environmental concerns. Cuba has largely transformed food production in order to pursue a more sustainable path. These practices are not limited to the countryside.<br/>Cuba is the recognized leader of urban agriculture.5 As Koont highlights, the <br/>AND<br/>percent of agriculture in Cuba. Almost all of urban agriculture is organic.<br/>Cuba’s environmental protections and agricultural innovations have gained considerable recognition. The 2006 Sustainability Index <br/>AND<br/>book to take a comprehensive look at this practice around the entire island.<br/>Koont indicates that the significance of urban agriculture in Cuba is that although Cuba is <br/>AND<br/>, Koont documents the impressive transformations that have taken place within this nation.<br/>While Cuba imports the majority of its calories and protein, urban agriculture has increased <br/>AND<br/>is the most practical and efficient means to supply the population with food.<br/>These transformations did not suddenly materialize. Koont provides a useful overview of the historical <br/>AND<br/>national consumption. Most of the Cuban diet came from imported food.11<br/>When the Soviet Union collapsed in the early 1990s, Cubans and their economy suffered <br/>AND<br/>ecological cycles of interdependence that large-scale, exploitative agriculture destroyed.13<br/>In spite of these hardships, Cuban society was equipped to contend with the ensuing <br/>AND<br/>made the agroecological transition possible during the economic crisis in the early 1990s.<br/>Koont examines how the early agroecological projects, prior to the Special Period, served <br/>AND<br/>system of urban agriculture, and a more sustainable form of food production.<br/>The pursuit of food sovereignty has yielded many benefits. Urban agriculture has increased food <br/>AND<br/>new jobs that subsumed 7 percent of the workforce and provided good wages.<br/>Urban agriculture and reforestation projects also constituted important gains for the environment. Shifting food <br/>AND<br/>and are responsible for each other through the production and consumption of food.<br/>Sustainable Urban Agriculture in Cuba is a detailed documentation of the agroecological transformation in Cuba<br/>AND<br/>production, increased employment, environmental recovery and protection, and community building.<br/>However, the majority of the book reads like a dry technical manual or guide <br/>AND<br/>of the challenges that Cubans still face in their quest for food sovereignty.<br/>Despite these shortcomings, Koont provides a much-needed detailed account of the strides <br/>AND<br/>and is worth investigating not just for their innovations, but for inspiration.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HLiftingsanctionsmeansagribusinesshasafreehandtodestroyCuba2019sagmodel2013maintainingsanctionsarevitaltoresistingagneoliberalism" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Lifting sanctions means agribusiness has a free hand to destroy Cuba’s ag model – maintaining sanctions are vital to resisting ag neoliberalism</span></h4><p>Gonzalez, 4 - Associate Professor, Seattle University School of Law (Carmen, "WHITHER GOES CUBA?

The only laws in economics are the laws of physics, everything else is contingent, supposition or vanity. An economy, growing in size and complexity, is firstly a thermodynamic system requiring increasing energy flows to grow and avoid decay. Waste, be it greenhouse gasses or landfill is also a natural outcome of such a thermodynamic process.<br/>News from Elsewhere<br/>It’s been part of the background noise for over half a century, warnings about <br/>AND<br/>crazy despots have always demanded our attention, at least while on TV.<br/>Yes we can21 Yes we can21 - chanted the posse of teenagers following Al Gore through a pavilion in Poznan, Poland for the annual gathering of climate policy acronyms.<br/>When not distracted by the ever-present, we’ve responded to these warnings with <br/>AND<br/>and environmental sink demands keep increasing, ecological indicators decline and inequality rises.<br/>The reality is that we are locked into an economy adapted to growth, and <br/>AND<br/>to greater poverty, and pose even greater risks to the banking system.<br/>It is an oxymoron to say we can do something unsustainable forever. How would <br/>AND<br/>age, confirming the earth centric universe against Galileo and Copernicus before him.<br/>What the Galileos of today are saying is that we are at or near the <br/>AND<br/>fall, and our visions will fall further and further from our grasp.<br/>They are saying that global food production is hitting an array of ecological constraints, while population growth and changing diets are driving up demand. They note that current food production is massively subsidised through fossil fuel inputs, and that as those inputs become less available, and people become poorer due to economic contraction, food productivity and access will be undermined.<br/>In totality, we are at the edge of an evolving systemic crisis. Peak oil and food constraints are likely to undermine the stability of our integrated globalised economy. The core pillars of that economy: critical infrastructure, production flows, economies of scale, the financial and monetary system, behavioural adaptation, resource access and energy flows-are likely to begin forcing contagious failure.<br/>The driving force of this failure is likely to be the fastest and most unstable process-the impact of energy and food constrained economic growth, and an already vulnerable monetary and financial system dependent upon continuing growth.<br/>Tightening binds<br/>Whatever of Ireland’s economic woes, the real debt bubble is global. The debt relative to GDP is far greater now in the US, UK, and much of Europe, than it ever was leading up to the great depression. Like many countries we responded to our debt bubble with more debt, we just shifted it onto the sovereign or the printing press.<br/>The indebted world, even without oil and food price rises is straining at the limits of debt servicing and credibility. Yet it is demanding even more credit, while its ability to service the debt is being undermined by debt deflation, austerity, rising job losses, and defaults. The bank lenders of that money can only lose so much before they are too are insolvent.<br/>Rising food and energy prices are driving the deflationary forces even harder. And if central banks misinterpret the cause of food and oil price rises, and raise interest rates, the deflationary pressures risk becoming cyclonic. The cost of essentials and debt servicing rise, while income declines. Discretionary spending will collapse, job losses and defaults rise, income will declines further. This re-enforcing spiral of decline will increase, and spread to more and more countries.<br/>The fear of contagion from peripheral Eurozone defaults are not merely that they could topple <br/>AND<br/>they are shown to have values far below what is required for solvency.<br/>What everybody wants and needs is a sudden and explosive increase in the production of real goods and services (GDP) to make their continual debt requirements serviceable. But that,even were it remotely possible, would require a big increase in oil flows through the global economy, just as global oil production has peaked and begins its decline. It cannot happen. This means that the global financial system is essentially insolvent now.<br/>The only choice is default or inflation on a global scale. It mean banks <br/>AND<br/>on fiat money, fractional reserve banking, and interest can only collapse.<br/>High oil and food prices are essentially probing the limits of the stability of the globalised economy. They will probe until there is a major collapse in global economic production. At which point our energy prices may fall, but our real income and purchasing power will fall faster.<br/>And markets will discover this truth quicker than monetary authorities and governments. Its expression will be in deeper and deeper economic stresses and major systemic banking collapses. Official responses will become more and more impotent, as their fundamental economic and policy tools no longer work, and their patina of control becomes hollow. If and when banking system contagion spreads to supply-chain contagion we may face existential challenges.<br/>Even were we to have the perfect monetary and financial system, without debt and <br/>AND<br/>for various reasons, and monetary instability would still destabilise supply-chains.<br/>Facing Ourselves 26 Facing Our Future<br/>We are at the beginning of a process in which our world-views crash against a fundamentally unstable financial system and ecological constraints. A time where we will learn that what was, will never return; and what was expected, can never be. We are facing a time of loss and uncertainty. A time of bank-runs, lost savings and pensions, of mass unemployment, electricity and mobile phone black-outs, of hunger and empty super-market shelves.<br/>A localised economy will no longer be something environmentalists aspire to develop; rather it will be forced upon us as bank failures, monetary uncertainty, and lost purchasing power sever links in the web of the global economy. But we no longer have indigenous economies to fall back upon.<br/>The gap between expectations and what can be realised is historically a major source of popular anger, and can ignite a cycle of fear, blame, violence, scape-goating, and authoritarian leadership from either left or right. It can give the avaricious the power and cover to appropriate wealth that might better be used for collective welfare.<br/>Yet who gave us the right to our expectations? They were built on the <br/>AND<br/>the delusion that we are the displaced God who transcended our own ecology.<br/>Yes, we can and will build a largely local economy out of the ruins of a collapsed globalised one. It will be a much poorer one and one where we will have lost much of what we take for granted. It can also provide a good life, where our basic needs are met, where meaningful lives can be lived, and a rich texture of experience found.</p><h4 id="HEvenmassiveeconomicdeclinehaszerochanceofwar-1" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Even massive economic decline has zero chance of war</span></h4><p>Robert <strong>Jervis 11</strong>, Professor in the Department of Political Science and School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University, December 2011, "Force in Our Times," Survival, Vol. 25, No. 4, p. 403-425<br/>Even if war is still seen as evil, the security community could be dissolved <br/>AND<br/>times bring about greater economic conflict, it will not make war thinkable.</p><h4 id="HGrowthmakeseco-collapseinevitable-1" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Growth makes eco-collapse inevitable</span></h4><p>Speth, law prof, 8—Served as President Jimmy Carter’s White House environmental <br/>AND<br/>, and Crossing from Crisis to Sustainability, Gigapedia, 6-9)</p><p>But the much larger and more threatening impacts stem from the economic activity of those <br/>AND<br/>modern capitalism, in each case seeking to identify the transformative changes needed.&nbsp;</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HExtinction-2" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Extinction</span></h4><p>Chen 2k—Professor of Law and Vance K.

In <br/>AND<br/>includes countries from one of the fastest-growing regions in the world.<br/>To increase competitiveness, foster economic growth and innovation, and explore ways to partner for global leadership, Presidents Obama and Peña Nieto announced on May 2 the establishment of a High-Level Economic Dialogue (HLED). We plan to hold the first meeting later this year. We will organize the dialogue around three broad themes: promoting competitiveness and connectivity; fostering economic growth, productivity, and innovation; and partnering for regional and global leadership.<br/>The HLED will increase cooperation in sectors that connect our economies, including transportation, telecommunications, and energy, and promote greater two-way investment. The dialogue will stimulate entrepreneurship and innovation, encourage the development of human capital, and examine regional and international initiatives, including our engagement on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, and the G20.<br/>Given the massive flow of goods and people across our shared border, modernizing border <br/>AND<br/>of legitimate commerce and travel, and strengthen law enforcement along the border.<br/>Our energy relationship with Mexico is a critical component of North American energy security. In 2012, Mexico was our second largest supplier of imported crude oil, the largest export market for U.S. refined petroleum products, and a growing market for U.S. natural gas exports. President Peña Nieto has made energy reform a priority, and if it is successful, Mexico could attract international investment and expertise to reverse the decline in its oil production.<br/>We have negotiated and signed the U.S.-Mexico Transboundary Hydrocarbons Agreement. <br/>AND<br/>look forward to working with the Senators to move this important legislation forward.<br/>In Mexico, the Peña Nieto administration is pursuing a broad reform agenda with a <br/>AND<br/>to reshape our neighbor’s economic landscape and expand our economic engagement with Mexico.<br/>SECURITY COOPERATION<br/>Since the Merida Initiative was announced in 2007, we have based our cooperation with <br/>AND<br/>money laundering, and demand for drugs on both sides of the border.<br/>Our Merida partnership is organized around four pillars:<br/>• Disrupting the capacity of organized criminal groups;<br/>• Institutionalizing reforms to sustain rule of law and respect for human rights;<br/>• Creating a 21st century border; and<br/>• Building strong and resilient communities.<br/>We are strengthening institutions, especially police, justice, and civil society organizations; expanding our border focus beyond interdiction of contraband to include facilitation of legitimate trade and travel; and building strong communities resistant to the influence of organized crime.<br/>Since the inception of the Merida Initiative, the U.S. government has <br/>AND<br/>goals in Mexico. The U.S. contribution is vitally important.<br/>U.S.-Mexico bilateral engagement has been transformed over the last 10 years<br/>AND<br/>our partnership can move forward to the benefit of both Americans and Mexicans.<br/>PEOPLE-TO-PEOPLE TIES<br/>The people-to-people ties that bind Mexico to the United States are <br/>AND<br/>families, neighbors, and friends, and contribute to our mutual understanding.<br/>During President Obama’s visit to Mexico, we announced new initiatives to use people-<br/>AND<br/>in both countries, just as Mexico begins to implement its education reforms.<br/>President Obama also spoke in Mexico of his administration’s vision for comprehensive immigration reform that <br/>AND<br/>migrants who seek to transit Mexico on their way to the United States.<br/>NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR DRUG DEMAND REDUCTION IN MEXICO<br/>We are working together on new opportunities for drug demand reduction in Mexico. The Peña Nieto administration has made demand reduction one of the principal pillars of its crime and violence prevention program, with the objective of modernizing and expanding its addiction diagnosis and treatment capabilities.<br/>The United States and Mexico will be able to apply this approach to three areas of demand reduction policy—professionalizing addiction treatment counseling, improving Mexican capacity to research and develop addiction prevention and treatment methods, and expanding the prevalence and use of drug treatment courts.<br/>GLOBAL ENGAGEMENT AND COOPERATION<br/>We are increasing cooperation with Mexico on global and regional issues. Mexico is an <br/>AND<br/>Nuclear Terrorism in May. We engage closely with Mexico on these issues.<br/>Our common interest in the environment and clean energy is another area of growing cooperation<br/>AND<br/>to engage with Central American partners in facilitating a robust regional electricity market.</p><h4 id="HThisishappeningnowinrecentmeetings2013it2019shighlevelclimatecooperationandpromotestheexchangeofinformationandexpertiseforrenewableenergy.Theaffisindistinguishablefromcurrenttrends" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>This is happening now in recent meetings – it’s high level climate cooperation and promotes the exchange of information and expertise for renewable energy. &nbsp;The aff is indistinguishable from current trends</span></h4><p>Targeted News Service, 7/26/13 ("Fourth Mexico - United States Meeting on Clean Energy and Climate Change", lexis)</p><p>The Mexican Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued the following news release:<br/>Senior officials from Mexico and the United States met in the Secretariat of Foreign Relations for the fourth meeting under the Bilateral Framework on Clean Energy and Climate Change.<br/>The progress of the current initiatives and bilateral cooperation in clean energy and climate change were discussed.<br/>Senior officials from Mexico and the United States attended the fourth meeting under the Bilateral Framework on Clean Energy and Climate Change to review the policies of both countries on renewable energy, technological innovation, energy efficiency and climate change. The meeting was agreed on last May by Presidents Enrique Pena Nieto and Barack Obama during their meeting in Mexico City.<br/>The delegations discussed recent developments and policy tools for promoting renewable energy and technological innovation, highlighting the priority given today to the use of renewable energy in their planning strategies.<br/>In addition to sharing their experiences with the electricity sector, they also discussed new developments in energy efficiency, such as the homologation of standards, high-efficiency equipment, economic incentives and energy management in buildings and for large users.<br/>They also evaluated the progress made on some of the initiatives proposed during the Clean Energy Ministerial forum and the Energy and Climate Partnership of the Americas, and they remarked on the importance of Mexico’s participation in the 21st Century Power Partnership.<br/>The delegations reviewed the programs put in place by the two countries to address climate change. The Mexican delegation discussed the publication of the General Law on Climate Change and President Enrique Pena Nieto’s National Climate Change Strategy, which provide a long-term vision and reaffirm Mexico’s commitment to this issue. The U.S. delegation explained the Climate Action Plan recently announced by President Barack Obama, highlighting its main features.<br/>The two delegations exchanged information on the follow-up to the low emission development strategies (LED) and the United Nations climate change negotiations, and reiterated their commitment to strengthening the climate regime through the adoption of a global agreement in 2015.<br/>Mexico and the United States are confident that the outcome of this meeting will complement and reinforce the current bilateral work on clean energy and climate change.<br/>The Mexican delegation was composed of senior officials from the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Energy, and Environment and Natural Resources; the Federal Commissions for Electricity (CFE), the Efficient Use of Energy (CONUEE) and Energy Regulation (CRE), and the National Institutes of Ecology and Climate Change (INECC) and Electrical Research (IIE).<br/>The United States’ delegation included senior officials from the Departments of State, Energy and Commerce, and the Trade and Development Agency (USTDA), and International Development (USAID).<br/>The Bilateral Framework on Clean Energy and Climate Change was established in 2009 by the Presidents of Mexico and the United States to strengthen the dialogue and cooperation on clean energy and climate change. The goal was to create a framework for the exchange of information and experiences to facilitate the joint efforts to develop low-carbon economies based on clean energy.</p><h4 id="HVotingissue2013theiraffisatbestatinyadjustmentinpolicywithsolvencyevidencethatadvocatescontinuingstatusquotrends.Voteagainstthemtoprotectnegativeground2013eveniftheycanpointtoaslightdifferenceintheirsolvency2Cit2019simpossibletoquantifyandnomeaningfulliteraturebaseexists2013itmakesfindinguniquedisadsimpossible" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Voting issue – their aff is at best a tiny adjustment in policy with solvency evidence that advocates continuing status quo trends. &nbsp;Vote against them to protect negative ground – even if they can point to a slight difference in their solvency, it’s impossible to quantify and no meaningful literature base exists – it makes finding unique disads impossible</span></h4><h3 id="HOil" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Oil</span></h3><h4 id="HOilfutureshighandrisingabove241082014economicrecoveryandNYME" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Oil futures high and rising above 24108—economic recovery and NYME</span></h4><p><strong>Investing 1/30</strong> ("U.S. oil prices rally to 4-week high after GDP report", www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/u.s.-oil-prices-rally-to-4-week-high-after-gdp-report-263273 <em>-<span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/u.s.-oil-prices-rally-to-4-week-high-after-gdp-report-263273  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/u.s.-oil-prices-rally-to-4-week-high-after-gdp-report-263273%27" tppabs="http://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/u.s.-oil-prices-rally-to-4-week-high-after-gdp-report-263273"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/u.s.-oil-prices-rally-to-4-week-high-after-gdp-report-263273</span></a></span>&nbsp;</em> candle)<br/>Investing.com - U.S. oil futures rallied to a four-<br/>AND<br/>U.S. crude contracts stood at USD9.60 a barrel.</p><p>The plan triggers an OPEC flood —- even if they don’t displace the transportation sector —- drops the price below 24100<br/>Schelmetic 11 (Tracey E., Contributor – TMC, "Saudi Prince Frets that High Oil Prices will Spur Drive to Alternative Energy", TMC, 6-1, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://green.tmcnet.com/channels/renewable-energy/articles/181084-saudi-prince-frets-that-high-oil-prices-will.htm  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://green.tmcnet.com/channels/renewable-energy/articles/181084-saudi-prince-frets-that-high-oil-prices-will.htm%27" tppabs="http://green.tmcnet.com/channels/renewable-energy/articles/181084-saudi-prince-frets-that-high-oil-prices-will.htm"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://green.tmcnet.com/channels/renewable-energy/articles/181084-saudi-prince-frets-that-high-oil-prices-will.htm</span></a></span>, Deech)</p><p>What do you do when you’re a theocratic ruler of an oil-rich nation <br/>AND<br/>– all of which would be detrimental to the oil-rich nation.<br/>Any sustained drop below 24100 per barrel causes Russian collapse —- that’s the key benchmark<br/>Whitmore 13 (Brian, Senior Russia Correspondent – Radio Free Europe, "After The Storm: Trends To Watch In Russia In 2013", Radio Free Europe, 1-2, The Power Vertical)</p><p>It began with a roar and it ended with a whimper.

An agent doing the acting —-"The United States" in "The United States should adopt a policy of free trade." Like the object of evaluation in a proposition of value, the agent is the subject of the sentence. 2. The verb should—the first part of a verb phrase that urges action. 3. An action verb to follow should in the should-verb combination. For example, should adopt here means to put a program or policy into action though governmental means. 4. A specification of directions or a limitation of the action desired. The phrase free trade, for example, gives direction and limits to the topic, which would, for example, eliminate consideration of increasing tariffs, discussing diplomatic recognition, or discussing interstate commerce. Propositions of policy deal with future action. Nothing has yet occurred. The entire debate is about whether something ought to occur.

For example, if the problem is whether to go to the basketball game tonight, if tickets are not too expensive and if transportation is available, the decision can be made individually. But if a friend’s car is needed to get to the game, then that person’s decision to furnish the transportation must be obtained.<br/>Complex problems, too, are subject to individual decision making.

Broadly speaking ... the president has two ways of making up his mind. The one is to turn to his subordinates—to his chiefs of staff and his cabinet officers and undersecretaries and the like—and to direct them to argue out the issues and to bring him an agreed decision…<br/>The other way is to sit like a judge at a hearing where the issues to be decided are debated. After he has heard the debate, after he has examined the evidence, after he has heard the debaters cross-examine one another, after he has questioned them himself he makes his decision…<br/>It is a much harder method in that it subjects the president to the stress of feeling the full impact of conflicting views, and then to the strain of making his decision, fully aware of how momentous it Is.

Therefore, all the above and other analyzes (there is more, eg., the pattern of 90k – 10k years characteristic of Glacial and Interglacial periods, etc.) indicate that the prediction of a "kill shot" from the Sun by Patrick Geryl and others, will not happen, quite the opposite: we could be at the doorsteps of another Ice Age. When asked what he thought of the "kill shot" model during our times, Leif Svaalgard called it "sensationalism". Robert’s book "Not by Fire but by Ice" has it’s name for a reason. People are being lured to look in the wrong direction by MSM, IPCC and others, but the facts are very clear and show a completely different problem that humanity will have to face very soon.

The only laws in economics are the laws of physics, everything else is contingent, supposition or vanity. An economy, growing in size and complexity, is firstly a thermodynamic system requiring increasing energy flows to grow and avoid decay. Waste, be it greenhouse gasses or landfill is also a natural outcome of such a thermodynamic process.<br/>News from Elsewhere<br/>It’s been part of the background noise for over half a century, warnings about <br/>AND<br/>crazy despots have always demanded our attention, at least while on TV.<br/>Yes we can21 Yes we can21 - chanted the posse of teenagers following Al Gore through a pavilion in Poznan, Poland for the annual gathering of climate policy acronyms.<br/>When not distracted by the ever-present, we’ve responded to these warnings with <br/>AND<br/>and environmental sink demands keep increasing, ecological indicators decline and inequality rises.<br/>The reality is that we are locked into an economy adapted to growth, and <br/>AND<br/>to greater poverty, and pose even greater risks to the banking system.<br/>It is an oxymoron to say we can do something unsustainable forever. How would <br/>AND<br/>age, confirming the earth centric universe against Galileo and Copernicus before him.<br/>What the Galileos of today are saying is that we are at or near the <br/>AND<br/>fall, and our visions will fall further and further from our grasp.<br/>They are saying that global food production is hitting an array of ecological constraints, while population growth and changing diets are driving up demand. They note that current food production is massively subsidised through fossil fuel inputs, and that as those inputs become less available, and people become poorer due to economic contraction, food productivity and access will be undermined.<br/>In totality, we are at the edge of an evolving systemic crisis. Peak oil and food constraints are likely to undermine the stability of our integrated globalised economy. The core pillars of that economy: critical infrastructure, production flows, economies of scale, the financial and monetary system, behavioural adaptation, resource access and energy flows-are likely to begin forcing contagious failure.<br/>The driving force of this failure is likely to be the fastest and most unstable process-the impact of energy and food constrained economic growth, and an already vulnerable monetary and financial system dependent upon continuing growth.<br/>Tightening binds<br/>Whatever of Ireland’s economic woes, the real debt bubble is global. The debt relative to GDP is far greater now in the US, UK, and much of Europe, than it ever was leading up to the great depression. Like many countries we responded to our debt bubble with more debt, we just shifted it onto the sovereign or the printing press.<br/>The indebted world, even without oil and food price rises is straining at the limits of debt servicing and credibility. Yet it is demanding even more credit, while its ability to service the debt is being undermined by debt deflation, austerity, rising job losses, and defaults. The bank lenders of that money can only lose so much before they are too are insolvent.<br/>Rising food and energy prices are driving the deflationary forces even harder. And if central banks misinterpret the cause of food and oil price rises, and raise interest rates, the deflationary pressures risk becoming cyclonic. The cost of essentials and debt servicing rise, while income declines. Discretionary spending will collapse, job losses and defaults rise, income will declines further. This re-enforcing spiral of decline will increase, and spread to more and more countries.<br/>The fear of contagion from peripheral Eurozone defaults are not merely that they could topple <br/>AND<br/>they are shown to have values far below what is required for solvency.<br/>What everybody wants and needs is a sudden and explosive increase in the production of real goods and services (GDP) to make their continual debt requirements serviceable. But that,even were it remotely possible, would require a big increase in oil flows through the global economy, just as global oil production has peaked and begins its decline. It cannot happen. This means that the global financial system is essentially insolvent now.<br/>The only choice is default or inflation on a global scale. It mean banks <br/>AND<br/>on fiat money, fractional reserve banking, and interest can only collapse.<br/>High oil and food prices are essentially probing the limits of the stability of the globalised economy. They will probe until there is a major collapse in global economic production. At which point our energy prices may fall, but our real income and purchasing power will fall faster.<br/>And markets will discover this truth quicker than monetary authorities and governments. Its expression will be in deeper and deeper economic stresses and major systemic banking collapses. Official responses will become more and more impotent, as their fundamental economic and policy tools no longer work, and their patina of control becomes hollow. If and when banking system contagion spreads to supply-chain contagion we may face existential challenges.<br/>Even were we to have the perfect monetary and financial system, without debt and <br/>AND<br/>for various reasons, and monetary instability would still destabilise supply-chains.<br/>Facing Ourselves 26 Facing Our Future<br/>We are at the beginning of a process in which our world-views crash against a fundamentally unstable financial system and ecological constraints. A time where we will learn that what was, will never return; and what was expected, can never be. We are facing a time of loss and uncertainty. A time of bank-runs, lost savings and pensions, of mass unemployment, electricity and mobile phone black-outs, of hunger and empty super-market shelves.<br/>A localised economy will no longer be something environmentalists aspire to develop; rather it will be forced upon us as bank failures, monetary uncertainty, and lost purchasing power sever links in the web of the global economy. But we no longer have indigenous economies to fall back upon.<br/>The gap between expectations and what can be realised is historically a major source of popular anger, and can ignite a cycle of fear, blame, violence, scape-goating, and authoritarian leadership from either left or right. It can give the avaricious the power and cover to appropriate wealth that might better be used for collective welfare.<br/>Yet who gave us the right to our expectations?

For example, if the problem is whether to go to the basketball game tonight, if tickets are not too expensive and if transportation is available, the decision can be made individually.

Broadly speaking ... the president has two ways of making up his mind. The one is to turn to his subordinates—to his chiefs of staff and his cabinet officers and undersecretaries and the like—and to direct them to argue out the issues and to bring him an agreed decision…<br/>The other way is to sit like a judge at a hearing where the issues to be decided are debated. After he has heard the debate, after he has examined the evidence, after he has heard the debaters cross-examine one another, after he has questioned them himself he makes his decision…<br/>It is a much harder method in that it subjects the president to the stress of feeling the full impact of conflicting views, and then to the strain of making his decision, fully aware of how momentous it Is. But there is no other satisfactory way by which momentous and complex issues can be decided.16<br/>John F.
