Growing NAFTA trade is exacerbating this problem. The latest data highlights this issue as US NAFTA trade with Mexico picked up in July with total value of goods traded increasing 7.9 to $43bn. ¶¶ Trucking remains the dominate mode of transport, comprising over 65 of the total value. Because of this, the border between the two countries remains problematic for transport providers and shippers.¶¶ In fact, a recent US Government Accountability Office reportconcluded that long lines at border entry points could deter economic trade. The report suggests infrastructure improvements and proper allocation of personnel are necessary to help reduce the congestion.&nbsp;</p><p>Congestion at the border undermines important trade flows between the US and Mexico – infrastructure is key for both economies<br/>Lee and Wilson 12 (Erik, Associate Director at the North American Center for Transborder Studies (NACTS) at Arizona State University, and Chris, Associate at the Mexico Institute of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. He develops the Institute’s research and programming on regional economic integration and U.S.-Mexico border affairs. "Whole Nations Waiting" Site Selection Magazine, July 2012. www.siteselection.com/issues/2012/jul/us-mex-border.cfm)</p><p>Commerce between the United States and Mexico is one of the great — yet underappreciated — success stories of the global economy. In 2011 U.S.-Mexico goods and services trade reached the major milestone of one-half trillion dollars with virtually no recognition. The United States is Mexico's top trading partner, and Mexico — which has gained macroeconomic stability and expanded its middle class over the last two decades — is the United States' second largest export market and third largest trading partner.¶ Seventy percent of bilateral commerce crosses the border via trucks, meaning the border region is literally where "the rubber hits the road" for bilateral relations. This also means that not only California and Baja California, but also Michigan and Michoacán, all have a major stake in efficient and secure border management.¶ The quantity of U.S.-Mexico trade is impressive, but its quality makes it unique. The United States and Mexico do not just sell goods to one another, they actually work together to manufacture them. Through production sharing, materials and parts often cross back and forth between factories on each side of the border as a final product is made and assembled. As a result, U.S. imports from Mexico contain, on average, 40 percent U.S. content, and Mexico's imports from the U.S. also have a high level of Mexican content.¶ This system of joint production has two important consequences. First, it means that our economies are profoundly linked. We tend to experience growth and recession together, and productivity gains or losses on one side of the border generally cause a corresponding gain or loss in competitiveness on the other side as well. Second, the fact that goods often cross the border several times as they are being produced creates a multiplier effect for gains and losses in border efficiency. Whereas goods from China only go through customs and inspection once as they enter the U.S. or Mexico, products built by regional manufacturers bear the costs of long and unpredictable border wait times and significant customs requirements each time they cross the U.S.-Mexico border.¶ Corridors in Crisis¶ This trade relationship requires major infrastructure to function effectively. The largest trade corridor, often referred to as the NASCO corridor, links central and eastern Mexico to Texas, the American Midwest, Northeast, and Ontario, utilizing the key Laredo-Nuevo Laredo ports of entry (POEs). Other important trade arteries include the CANAMEX Corridor, which connects western Mexico to the intermountain United States and Canadian province of Alberta, as well as the shorter but high-volume I-5 corridor connecting California to Baja California. As the economies of both the U.S. and Mexico grow, it is likely that this network of freight transportation infrastructure — and the land POEs that serve as nodes in this network — will experience added stress.¶ Unfortunately, the infrastructure and capacity of the ports of entry to process goods and individuals entering the United States has not kept pace with the expansion of bilateral trade or the population growth of the border region. Instead, the need for greater border security following the terrorist attacks of 9/11 led to a thickening of the border, dividing the twin cities that characterize the region and adding costly, long and unpredictable wait times for commercial and personal crossers alike. Congestion acts as a drag on the competitiveness of the region and of the United States and Mexico in their entirety. Solutions are needed that strengthen both border security and efficiency at the same time.¶ The integrated nature of the North American manufacturing sector makes eliminating border congestion an important way to enhance regional competitiveness. The global economic crisis forced manufacturers to look for ways to cut costs. After taking into consideration factors such as rising fuel costs, increasing wages in China and the ability to automate an ever greater portion of the production process, many American companies decided to nearshore factories to Mexico or reshore them to the United States, taking advantage of strong human capital and shorter supply chains. Bilateral trade dropped significantly during the recession but has since rebounded strongly, growing significantly faster than trade with China.¶ But the growth of trade continues to add pressure on the already strained POEs and transportation corridors. Several studies have attempted to quantify the costs of border area congestion to the economies of the United States and Mexico. In what is perhaps a testimony to the fragmented and geographically disperse nature of the border region, most of these studies have focused on particular North-South corridors of traffic and trade rather than taking a comprehensive, border-wide approach. The specific results of the studies (see table on p. 108) are quite varied. Nonetheless, one message comes through quite clearly — long and unpredictable wait times at the POEs are costing the United States and Mexican economies many billions of dollars each year.</p><p>Plan is key to resolve congestion and boost border infrastructure for both the US and Mexico <br/>Wilson 12 (Christopher Wilson, associate at the Mexico Institute of teh Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. "U.S. Competitiveness: The Mexican Connection" 2012. www.issues.org/28.4/p_wilson.html)</p><p>Policy for a competitive region¶ The border. With an integrated regional manufacturing sector, the same goods cross the U.S.-Mexico border several times as they are being produced. Consequently, the effects of any barriers to trade, tariff or nontariff, are multiplied by the number of border crossings that take place during production. In the NAFTA region, tariffs are not a significant trade barrier, but the importance of having efficient border management and customs procedures is difficult to overstate.¶ After NAFTA took effect and trade barriers fell, bilateral trade skyrocketed, more than tripling by 2000. But after the terrorist attacks of 9/11, a new approach to homeland security led to a “thickening” of the border. Trade and passenger travel ground to a near halt. Although trade has been moving since then, the new security concerns have meant that there was never a return to the status quo. Between 2000 and 2010, legal entries of commercial trucks into the United States at the southern border dropped by 41. Since then, several studies have attempted to estimate the cost of increased border wait times on the regional economy, particularly of border communities. The results are varied, but there is widespread agreement that border-related congestion has had a multibillion-dollar effect on the U.S. and Mexican economies.¶ Seeking to mitigate these costs, the U.S. and Mexican governments developed the 21st Century Border initiative, which is based largely on the idea that neither security nor efficiency has to be sacrificed to improve the other. By expediting the flow of safe and legal border crossers and cargo, officials can focus more of their attention on seeking dangerous people and goods. This is the concept behind the trusted traveler (SENTRI) and trusted shipper (FAST and C-TPAT) programs in place at the Mexican border. Frequent border crossers prove they are low risk by undergoing an extensive background check and interview process. In return, they get to use special lanes to quickly cross the border.¶ There is no silver bullet in border management, but these programs are the closest thing. They make the border safer while lessening the need for building more vehicle lanes at entry ports and increasing the number of border staff. They should be expanded and vigorously promoted. Where they are in place, the United States should work with Mexican officials to ensure that use of the dedicated express lanes significantly reduces waiting times, so that there is an incentive to join the programs.¶ Moderate infrastructure investments are also needed, because although trade has quintupled, relatively few entry ports have seen any major upgrades or expansions. Public/private partnerships are an important mechanism to bring needed funding to the border area, and the Department of Homeland Security should work with Congress to create secure and appropriate mechanisms to encourage their use, if it determines that the current legal environment excessively limits such use. Such partnerships have been successful in some areas, but many border communities and businesses would be willing to commit more resources to facilitate travel and commerce.¶ Transportation networks. Given the importance of U.S.-Mexico trade, the development of regional transportation networks to facilitate trade is too important to leave to chance and ad hoc processes. Local, state, and federal representatives should and do have a voice in the process of guiding the development of border infrastructure and the highway and rail lines that link the interior states of Mexico and the United States. What is lacking is a coherent and robust master planning process to ensure that strategic rather than political interests are the guiding force behind border and transportation infrastructure investments.¶ In 2006, California and Baja California took the initiative to begin developing a regional master plan, an awardwinning project that many believe could be successfully replicated. Other regions of the U.S.-Mexico border have similar plans in various stages of development, but a true master plan spanning the entire border would best facilitate the competitiveness of the United States and Mexico.<br/>Plan creates new funding which serves as a catalyst for more investment <br/>Mosqueda, Bachelor's in journalism, 12 Priscila, 7-18-12, Texas Observer, “Sister Organizations Continue to Improve Infrastructure Along Border: Binational Institutions Fund Projects to Encourage Economic Growth,” <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.texasobserver.org/sister-organizations-continue-to-improve-infrastructure-along-border/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.texasobserver.org/sister-organizations-continue-to-improve-infrastructure-along-border/%27" tppabs="http://www.texasobserver.org/sister-organizations-continue-to-improve-infrastructure-along-border/"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.texasobserver.org/sister-organizations-continue-to-improve-infrastructure-along-border/</span></a></span>, accessed 6-26-13</p><p>Projects are partially funded by the Bank, with local, state and federal governments making up most of the remainder of expenses.¶“The bank serves as a catalyst to bring that other investment to the table; we don’t seek to be the sole financier of any infrastructure project,” spokesperson Juan Antonio Flores says. “The local community needs to be invested in it.”¶The core mission of the bank, he says, is to provide environmental infrastructure that will improve communities’ quality of life as well as promote economic growth. <br/>Infrastructure constraints create business uncertainty – it’s reverse causal<br/>Donohue and Zozaya 11 (Thomas Donohue, President and CEO of the US Chamber of Commerce, José Zozaya President American Chamber of Commerce of Mexico, 2011, “Steps to a 21st Century U.S.-Mexico Border A U.S. Chamber of Commerce Border Report” online @ <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.uschamber.com/sites/default/files/reports/2011_us_mexico_report.pdf  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.uschamber.com/sites/default/files/reports/2011_us_mexico_report.pdf%27" tppabs="http://www.uschamber.com/sites/default/files/reports/2011_us_mexico_report.pdf"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.uschamber.com/sites/default/files/reports/2011_us_mexico_report.pdf</span></a></span></p><p>Businesses rely on just-in-time inventory management and depend on predictability and speed in their supply chains. Consequently, supply chains are critical to businesses’ underlying value, growth potential, and economic competitiveness. In many cases, before a product is completed, it may have crossed the border numerous times, necessitating a swift crossing process. An ef?cient supply chain is a lifeline for economic cooperation and mutual prosperity, and it contributes to our two countries’ competitive advantage. Unfortunately, supply chains often come to a halt due to border delays, security concerns, and infrastructure constraints. These issues create an environment of uncertainty in the business community, and uncertainty is the enemy of investment, job creation, economic prosperity, and supply chain security. We need to address these issues together in order to grow our trade relationship. Solving these issues will take collaboration, and the solutions are both short and long term. The business community is ?nding that sometimes likely solutions to border congestion are not being tried or, once tried, implemented. Nevertheless, we are encouraged by a recent willingness by leadership at CBP to engage in pilots and test new innovative ways to approach the border.

These conclusions are based on the following fitted growth expression: ¶ y(90) - y(70) = 1.63 - 0.39 y(70) + 0.20 kp + 0.28 kg + 0.26 eff + 0.18•h - 0.41- debt - 0.29 -gc. ¶ and utilize sample average data as well as data for Mexico. Conse-quently, these policy conclusions are conditional on assumption that the specific process generating Mexican economic growth is closely captured by the average process estimated for the entire set of countries in the sample. A preferable approach would be to utilize separate time series for the Mexican economy — but, unfortunately, this is unfeasible due to limitations of data. ¶ 1)The public capital stock is an important determinant of long run output per capita and of transitional growth rates. Figure 8a shows the relationship between public capital and economic growth for the entire cross country sample. For Mexico, a 1 (or 33 billion pesos) increase in public capital would lead to a 0.28 (or 88 pesos) increase in the long run level of output per capita — and an increase in the average growth rate of just over 0.01 per year. 2) The private capital stock also is an important determinant of long run output per capita and of transitional growth rates. Figure 8b shows the relationship between private capital andf,g economic growth for the entire sample of developing countries. For Mexico, a 1 (or 54 billion pesos) increase in private capital would lead to a 0.20 (or 63 pesos) increase in the long run level of output per capita — and an increase in the average growth rate of around 0.01 per year. 3) For the typical country in the sample, a reallocation of the total capital stock from private to public capital would modestly increase the long run level of output per capita and the rate of economic growth. On average, therefore, the types of capital included in the private capital stock have been over-accumulated relative to the types of capital in-cluded in the public capital stock. For Mexico, a 1 (or 54 billion pesos) reallocation of capital would increase the long run level of per capita output by 0.15 (or 47 pesos)— and the rate of economic growth by just under 0.01 per year. This relatively large impact arises because production in the Mexican economy is private (rather than public) capital intensive — at least relative to the entire set of developing countries in the sample. This does not imply that Mexico could expect to reap significant productivity and output gains by reversing the outcome of recent privatization efforts; rather, it implies that Mexico could experience economic improvement by investing somewhat more in the types of capital which, typically, are included in the public capital stock and somewhat less in the types of capital which are included in the private capital stock. 4) The efficiency of use of the public capital stock is a key factor in explaining long run levels of output per capita and transitional growth. Figure 8c displays the overall relationship between efficiency and economic growth. In Mexico, a 1 increase in public capital efficiency would result in a 0.26 (or 81 pesos) increase in long run output per capita — and an increase in the average growth rate of somewhat more than 0.01 per year. We agree, then, with Hulten (1996) that the economic growth depends on the efficiency with which public capital is utilized just as much as on the size of the public capital stock. 5) The human capital stock also is an important determinant of long run per capita output and transitional growth. Figure 8d depicts the relationship between human capital and economic growth for the broad set of developing countries. For Mexico, a 1 increase in human capital would lead to a 0.18 (or 56 pesos) increase in long run per capita output — and an increase in the average growth rate of somewhat less than 0.01 per year. 6) The level of external public debt is a critical factor determining the long run level of per capita output and the rate of economic growth. Figure 8e shows the relationship between external public debt, mea-sured as a ratio to output, and economic growth. In Mexico, a le (or 7 billion pesos) increase in external public debt would lead to a 0.09 (or 28 pesos) reduction in the long run level of per capita output — and an approximate 0.005 per year reduction in the rate of economic growth. 7) The level of government consumption spending is a key deter-minant of the long run level of output per capita and economic growth. Figure 8f depicts the relationship between government consumption spending, as a ratio to output, and economic growth. In Mexico, a 1 (or 2 billion pesos) increase in government consumption spending would result in a 0.29 (or 91 pesos) decrease in the long run level of per capita output — and a more than 0.01 per year decrease in the rate of economic growth. 8) The means of financing capital, generally, and public capital, specifically, is important to long run per capita output levels and to rates of economic growth. In Mexico, a 1 (or 33 billion pesos) increase in public capital would increase or decrease long run per capita output (and economic growth) — depending on how the public capital is financed. Specifically, if the rise in public capital is financed by a reduction in government consumption, economic growth will be stimu-lated and there will be a rise in long run per capita output equal to 178 pesos (or 0.57) — and a rise in annual growth of some 0.02. But if the rise in public capital is financed by an equal rise in external borrowing, economic growth will be depressed and there will be a drop in long run per capita output equal to 1.1 (or 341 pesos) — and a drop in annual growth of around 0.05 percent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>That causes two scenarios for crisis<br/>1st - Mexican economy is vital to the US – trade, exports, jobs, fundamentals<br/>Sarukhan, 12 (Arturo, Ambassador of Mexico to the United States, “Mexico ‘Critically Important’ to US Economy,” Wilson Center, 2/24/12, video testimony, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/mexico-E28098critically-importantE28099-to-us-economy  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/mexico-E28098critically-importantE28099-to-us-economy%27" tppabs="http://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/mexico-E28098critically-importantE28099-to-us-economy"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/mexico-E28098critically-importantE28099-to-us-economy</span></a></span>, Tashma)</p><p>It’s an incredibly strong relationship, for starters, because a lot of people sometimes don’t stop to think that we trade one billion dollars a day of goods in both directions. Second, that Mexico is the United States’ depending on crate loads that we are either third, or second largest trading partner with the United States. China and Mexico have been sort of in second or third, and we are the second largest buyer of U.S. exports on the face of the Earth. Depending what your area of geographic expertise or fondness is, if you think of Latin America, Mexico buys more U.S. exports than all of Latin America and the Caribbean combined. If you’re focused on Europe, Mexico buys more U.S. exports than the combined purchase of the U.K., Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands. If you’re focused on the new, sexy Asia-Pacific, Mexico is buying more U.S. exports than Japan and China combined. We buy more exports than all the four BRIC countries put together, so it’s a very compelling story. 26 states in America today have Mexico as their #1 or #2 export market, and there are ten million U.S. jobs directly related to trade with Mexico in those states. So, it is very vibrant, very important to weigh economic relationship. Mexico’s macroeconomic fundamentals, when the world is hurting still and still facing some of the challenges from the global recession, Mexico growth last year was five percent with 3.1 percent inflation and four percent unemployment. These are very compelling numbers. I think that the macroeconomic fundamentals of Mexico are sound, and this two-way successful relationship that we have developed is critically important for the social well-being and the prosperity of Americans.<br/>US is key to the global economy <br/>Lagarde 13 (Christine Lagarde, Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund. "Strong U.S. Economy, Strong Global Economy—Two Sides of Same Coin" September 19, 2013. www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/survey/so/2013/NEW091913A.htm)</p><p>In a world of increasing economic interconnections, the United States’s stake in the global recovery is greater than ever, IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde said in a speech to business leaders at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Washington, D.C.¶ “What happens elsewhere in the world—be it the success of recovery in Europe or the continued smooth functioning of supply chains in Asia—matters increasingly for the United States,” Lagarde said. “The converse is also true. What happens here matters increasingly for the global economy.”¶ Her remarks, which focused on the interplay between the global economy and the U.S. economy, also highlighted the need to find joint solutions to secure a lasting, balanced and widely shared global recovery.¶ “Job creation is a critical ingredient of any economic recovery, domestic or global,” she emphasized. Businesses have a key role to play, Lagarde said, but at the same time, policymakers have an important responsibility to help “shape the environment in which businesses and citizens can thrive—and jobs can be created.”¶ Changing global picture¶ Lagarde said that global growth remains subdued, while acknowledging that the global economic environment is changing. She emphasized that economies are moving at different speeds and that the fruits of growth are not evenly shared, both in the United States and other countries.¶ The U.S. economy is growing and, after a long time, so is the Euro Area. In Japan, aggressive policy support and the ongoing reform process is helping to spur growth. The emerging market economies, on the other hand, are slowing. “For some, this may be a shift toward more balanced and sustainable growth,” Lagarde told the audience. “For others, it reflects the need to address imbalances that have made them more vulnerable to the recent market turbulence.”¶ Reinforcing the point about global interconnections, Lagarde cited the IMF’s recent “spillover” analysis, which suggests that if the world’s five major economies were to work together to adopt a more rigorous, comprehensive, and compatible set of policies, it could boost global GDP by about 3 percent over the longer run.¶ U.S. recovery gaining strength¶ Lagarde noted that the U.S. economy is gaining strength, calling this good news for America—and good news for the world economy. Although growth is still modest—well under 2 percent—it should accelerate by a full percentage point next year, Lagarde said, adding that the private sector is playing a key role as the engine of growth and job creation.¶ Despite signs of strengthening, the latest jobs data present a mixed picture, with employment remaining well below pre-crisis levels. “The issue of jobs remains paramount,” said Lagarde, noting that jobs and growth is an increasingly important component of the IMF’s policy advice.¶ Lagarde highlighted three key recommendations for U.S. policymakers, drawn from the IMF’s most recent assessment of the U.S. economy.¶ • Fix public finances. Fiscal consolidation could be slower in the short run, but more action is needed to reduce long-run pressures on the budget. Lagarde also warned that political uncertainty over the budget and debt ceiling were not helpful to the recovery. “It is essential to resolve this, and the earlier the better,” she said, “for confidence, for markets, and for the real economy.”¶ • Appropriately calibrate monetary policy. When the time comes, exit from unconventional monetary policy should be gradual, tied to progress in economic recovery and unemployment, and should be clearly communicated and in a dialogue.¶ • Complete financial sector reform. While there has been progress on this front, attention needs to focus on the outstanding “danger zones,” such as derivatives and shadow banking.¶ Global interconnections and role of IMF¶ Lagarde underscored the unique role of the U.S. in the global economy, noting that the economy accounts for 11 percent of global trade and 20 percent of global manufacturing. The country’s global financial ties run deep too, she said. Foreign banks hold about $5.5 trillion of U.S. assets, and U.S. banks hold $3 trillion of foreign assets.¶ While these interconnections have great benefits for the United States, they are not without risks, Lagarde cautioned, referring to the collapse of Lehman Brothers five years ago that ushered in “a harsh new reality” across sectors, countries, and the world.<br/>Economic crisis causes global nuclear war and terrorism<br/>Harris and Burrows 9(Mathew, PhD European History @ Cambridge, counselor of the U.S. National Intelligence Council (NIC) and Jennifer, member of the NIC’s Long Range Analysis Unit “Revisiting the Future: Geopolitical Effects of the Financial Crisis” <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.ciaonet.org/journals/twq/v32i2/f_0016178_13952.pdf)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.ciaonet.org/journals/twq/v32i2/f_0016178_13952.pdf)%27" tppabs="http://www.ciaonet.org/journals/twq/v32i2/f_0016178_13952.pdf)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.ciaonet.org/journals/twq/v32i2/f_0016178_13952.pdf)</span></a></span><br/>Of course, the report encompasses more than economics and indeed believes the future is likely to be the result of a number of intersecting and interlocking forces. With so many possible permutations of outcomes, each with ample Revisiting the Future opportunity for unintended consequences, there is a growing sense of insecurity. Even so, history may be more instructive than ever. While we continue to believe that the Great Depressionis not likely to be repeated, the lessons to be drawn from that period include the harmful effects on fledgling democracies and multiethnic societies (think Central Europe in 1920s and 1930s) and on the sustainability of multilateral institutions (think League of Nations in the same period). There is no reason to think that this would not be truein the twenty-first as much as in the twentieth century. For that reason, the ways in which the potential for greaterconflict could grow would seem to be even more apt in aconstantly volatile economic environment as they would be if change would be steadier. In surveying those risks, the report stressed the likelihood that terrorism and nonproliferation will remain priorities even as resource issues move up on the international agenda. Terrorism’s appeal will decline ifeconomic growth continues in the Middle East and youth unemployment is reduced. For those terrorist groups that remain active in 2025, however, the diffusion of technologies and scientific knowledge will place some of the world’s most dangerous capabilities within their reach. Terrorist groups in 2025 will likely be a combination of descendants of long established groups_inheriting organizational structures, command and control processes, and training procedures necessary to conductsophisticated attacks and newly emergent collections of the angry and disenfranchised that become self-radicalized, particularly in the absence of economic outlets that would become narrower in an economic downturn. The most dangerous casualty of anyeconomically-induced drawdownof U.S. military presencewould almost certainly be the Middle East. Although Iran’s acquisition of nuclear weapons is not inevitable, worries about a nuclear-armed Iran could lead states in the region to develop new security arrangements with external powers, acquire additional weapons, and consider pursuing their own nuclear ambitions.It is not clear thatthe type of stable deterrent relationship that existed between the great powers for most of the Cold War would emergenaturally in the Middle East with a nuclear Iran. Episodes of low intensity conflict and terrorism taking place under a nuclear umbrella could lead to an unintended escalation and broader conflict if clear red lines between those states involved are not well established. The close proximity of potential nuclear rivals combined with underdeveloped surveillance capabilities and mobile dual-capable Iranian missile systems also will produce inherent difficulties in achieving reliable indications and warning of an impending nuclear attack. The lack of strategic depth in neighboring states like Israel, short warning and missile flight times, and uncertainty of Iranian intentions may place more focus on preemptionrather than defense, potentially leading to escalating crises. 36 Types of conflictthat the world continues to experience, such as over resources, could reemerge, particularly if protectionismgrows and there is a resort to neo-mercantilist practices. Perceptions of renewed energy scarcity will drive countries to take actions to assure their future access to energy supplies. In the worst case, this could result in interstate conflictsif government leaders deem assured access to energy resources, for example, to be essential for maintaining domestic stability and the survival of their regime. Even actions short of war, however, will have important geopolitical implications. Maritime security concerns are providing a rationale for naval buildups and modernization efforts, such as China’s and India’s development of blue water naval capabilities. If the fiscal stimulus focus for these countries indeed turns inward, one of the most obvious funding targets may be military. Buildup of regional naval capabilities could lead to increased tensions, rivalries, and counterbalancing moves, but it also will create opportunities for multinational cooperation in protecting critical sea lanes. With water also becoming scarcer in Asia and the Middle East, cooperation to manage changing water resources is likely to be increasingly difficult both within and between states in a more dog-eat-dog world.&nbsp;</p><p>Studies prove our impact<br/>Royal 10 — Jedidiah Royal, Director of Cooperative Threat Reduction at the U.S. Department of Defense, M.Phil. Candidate at the University of New South Wales, 2010 (“Economic Integration, Economic Signalling and the Problem of Economic Crises,” Economics of War and Peace: Economic, Legal and Political Perspectives, Edited by Ben Goldsmith and Jurgen Brauer, Published by Emerald Group Publishing, ISBN 0857240048, p. 213-215)</p><p>Less intuitive is how periods of economic decline may increase the likelihood of external conflict. Political science literature has contributed a moderate degree of attention to the impact of economic decline and the security and defence behaviour of interdependent states. Research in this vein has been considered at systemic, dyadic and national levels. Several notable contributions follow. ¶ First, on the systemic level, Pollins (2008) advances Modelski and Thompson's (1996) work on leadership cycle theory, finding that rhythms in the global economy are associated with the rise and fall of a pre-eminent power and the often bloody transition from one pre-eminent leader to the next. As such, exogenous shocks such as economic crises could usher in a redistribution of relative power (see also Gilpin. 1981) that leads to uncertainty about power balances, increasing the risk of miscalculation (Feaver, 1995). Alternatively, even a relatively certain redistribution of power could lead to a permissive environment for conflict as a rising power may seek to challenge a declining power (Werner. 1999). Separately, Pollins (1996) also shows that global economic cycles combined with parallel leadership cycles impact the likelihood of conflict among major, medium and small powers, although he suggests that the causes and connections between global economic conditions and security conditions remain unknown. ¶ Second, on a dyadic level, Copeland's (1996, 2000) theory of trade expectations suggests that 'future expectation of trade' is a significant variable in understanding economic conditions and security behaviour of states. He argues that interdependent states are likely to gain pacific benefits from trade so long as they have an optimistic view of future trade relations. However, if the expectations of future trade decline, particularly for difficult end page 213 to replace items such as energy resources, the likelihood for conflict increases, as states will be inclined to use force to gain access to those resources. Crises could potentially be the trigger for decreased trade expectations either on its own or because it triggers protectionist moves by interdependent states.4 ¶ Third, others have considered the link between economic decline and external armed conflict at a national level. Blomberg and Hess (2002) find a strong correlation between internal conflict and external conflict, particularly during periods of economic downturn. They write,¶ The linkages between internal and external conflict and prosperity are strong and mutually reinforcing. Economic conflict tends to spawn internal conflict, which in turn returns the favour. Moreover, the presence of a recession tends to amplify the extent to which international and external conflicts self-reinforce each other. (Blomberg and Hess, 2002. p. 89) ¶ Economic decline has also been linked with an increase in the likelihood of terrorism (Blomberg, Hess, and Weerapana, 2004), which has the capacity to spill across borders and lead to external tensions. ¶ Furthermore, crises generally reduce the popularity of a sitting government. “Diversionary theory" suggests that, when facing unpopularity arising from economic decline, sitting governments have increased incentives to fabricate external military conflicts to create a 'rally around the flag' effect. Wang (1996), DeRouen (1995). and Blomberg, Hess, and Thacker (2006) find supporting evidence showing that economic decline and use of force are at least indirectly correlated. Gelpi (1997), Miller (1999), and Kisangani and Pickering (2009) suggest that the tendency towards diversionary tactics are greater for democratic states than autocratic states, due to the fact that democratic leaders are generally more susceptible to being removed from office due to lack of domestic support. DeRouen (2000) has provided evidence showing that periods of weak economic performance in the United States, and thus weak Presidential popularity, are statistically linked to an increase in the use of force. ¶ In summary, recent economic scholarship positively correlates economic integration with an increase in the frequency of economic crises, whereas political science scholarship links economic decline with external conflict at systemic, dyadic and national levels.5 This implied connection between integration, crises and armed conflict has not featured prominently in the economic-security debate and deserves more attention. ¶ This observation is not contradictory to other perspectives that link economic interdependence with a decrease in the likelihood of external conflict, such as those mentioned in the first paragraph of this chapter. end page 214 Those studies tend to focus on dyadic interdependence instead of global interdependence and do not specifically consider the occurrence of and conditions created by economic crises. As such, the view presented here should be considered ancillary to those views.<br/>2nd - Mexican Economic growth guts the drug trade <br/>Shoichet ’12 11/27/12, Catherine E.

So far, the impact on the United States and beyond has been minimal. But there also isn’t much sign that the army is winning, either, and that raises a disturbing question: What if Calderon loses?¶ The CIA’s worst nightmare during the Cold War (outside of an administration which forced transparency on it, of course) was the radicalization or collapse of Mexico. The template then was communism, but narco-capitalism doesn’t look much better.¶ The prospect of a wholesale collapse that sent millions upon millions of Mexican refugees fleeing across the northern border so far seems remote. But Mexico’s army has its own problems with corruption, and a sizeable number of Mexicans regard Calderon’s razor-thin 2006 electoral victory over a leftist rival as illegitimate. With Mexico’s economy reeling and the traditional safety valve of illegal immigration to America dwindling, the potential for serious trouble exists.¶ Meanwhile, Mexico ranks with Saudi Arabia and Canada as the three suppliers of oil the United States could not do without. Should things come unglued there and Pemex production shut down even temporarily, the shock on oil markets could be profound, again, sending its waves throughout the global economy. Long-term, PEMEX production has been sliding anyway, thanks to oil fields well-beyond their peak and restrictions on foreign investment.¶ Domestically in the U.S., any trouble involving Mexico invariably will cause a bipartisan demand for more security on the southern border, inflame anti-immigrant sentiment and possibly force Obama to remember his campaign promise to “renegotiate NAFTA,” a pledge he deftly sidestepped once in office.<br/>Energy shocks cause great power nuke war <br/>Islam Yasin Qasem 7, a doctoral candidate in the Department of Politics and Social Sciences at the University of Pompeu Fabra (UPF) in Barcelona, MA in International Affairs from Columbia, July 9, 2007, “The Coming Warfare of Oil Shortage,” online: <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.opednews.com/articles/opedne_islam_ya_070709_the_coming_warfare_o.htm  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.opednews.com/articles/opedne_islam_ya_070709_the_coming_warfare_o.htm%27" tppabs="http://www.opednews.com/articles/opedne_islam_ya_070709_the_coming_warfare_o.htm"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.opednews.com/articles/opedne_islam_ya_070709_the_coming_warfare_o.htm</span></a></span><br/>Recognizing the strategic value of oil for their national interests, superpowers will not hesitate to unleash their economic and military power to ensure secure access to oil resources, triggering worldwide tension, if not armed conflict. &nbsp;And while superpowers like the United States maintain superior conventional military power, in addition to their nuclear power, some weaker states are already nuclearly armed, others are seeking nuclear weapons.

The collapse of a state usually comes as a surprise, has a rapid onset, and poses acute problems. The collapse of Yugoslavia into a chaotic tangle of warring nationalities in 1990 suggests how suddenly and catastrophically state collapse can happen - in this case, a state which had hosted the 1984 Winter Olympics at Sarajevo, and which then quickly became the epicenter of the ensuing civil war. In terms of worst-case scenarios for the Joint Force and indeed the world, two large and important states bear consideration for a rapid and sudden collapse: Pakistan and Mexico.Some forms of collapse in Pakistan would carry with it the likelihood of a sustained violent and bloody civil and sectarian war, an even bigger haven for violent extremists, and the question of what would happen to its nuclear weapons. That “perfect storm” of uncertainty alone might require the engagement of U.S. and coalition forces into a situation of immense complexity and danger with no guarantee they could gain control of the weapons and with the real possibility that a nuclear weapon might be used. The Mexican possibility may seem less likely, but the government, its politicians, police, and judicial infrastructure are all under sustained assault and pressure by criminal gangs and drug cartels. How that internal conflict turns out over the next several years will have a major impact on the stability of the Mexican state. Any descent by the Mexico into chaos would demand an American response based on the serious implications for homeland security alone. Yes, the “rapid collapse” of Mexico would change everything with respect to the global security environment. Such a collapse would have enormous humanitarian, constitutional, economic, cultural, and security implications for the U.S. It would seem the U.S. federal government, indeed American society at large, would have little ability to focus serious attention on much else in the world. The hypothetical collapse of Pakistan is a scenario that has already been well discussed. In the worst case, the U.S. would be able to isolate itself from most effects emanating from south Asia. However, there would be no running from a Mexican collapse.&nbsp;</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>Hegemony prevents multiple nuclear conflicts<br/>Brooks, Ikenberry, and Wohlforth ’13 <br/>(Stephen, Associate Professor of Government at Dartmouth College, John Ikenberry is the Albert G.

Wohlforth is the Daniel Webster Professor in the Department of Government at Dartmouth College “Don’t Come Home America: The Case Against Retrenchment,” International Security, Vol. 37, No. 3 (Winter 2012/13), pp. 7–51)<br/>A core premise of deep engagement is that it prevents the emergence of a far more dangerous global security environment. For one thing, as noted above, the United States’ overseas presence gives it the leverage to restrain partners from taking provocative action. Perhaps more important, its core alliance commitments also deter states with aspirations to regional hegemony from contemplating expansion and make its partners more secure, reducing their incentive to adopt solutions to their security problems that threaten others and thus stoke security dilemmas. The contention that engaged U.S. power dampens the baleful effects of anarchy is consistent with influential variants of realist theory. Indeed, arguably the scariest portrayal of the war-prone world that would emerge absent the “American Pacifier” is provided in the works of John Mearsheimer, who forecasts dangerous multipolar regions replete with security competition, arms races, nuclear proliferation and associated preventive war temptations, regional rivalries, and even runs at regional hegemony and full-scale great power war. 72 How do retrenchment advocates, the bulk of whom are realists, discount this benefit? Their arguments are complicated, but two capture most of the variation: (1) U.S. security guarantees are not necessary to prevent dangerous rivalries and conflict in Eurasia; or (2) prevention of rivalry and conflict in Eurasia is not a U.S. interest. Each response is connected to a different theory or set of theories, which makes sense given that the whole debate hinges on a complex future counterfactual (what would happen to Eurasia’s security setting if the United States truly disengaged?). Although a certain answer is impossible, each of these responses is nonetheless a weaker argument for retrenchment than advocates acknowledge. The first response flows from defensive realism as well as other international relations theories that discount the conflict-generating potential of anarchy under contemporary conditions. 73 Defensive realists maintain that the high expected costs of territorial conquest, defense dominance, and an array of policies and practices that can be used credibly to signal benign intent, mean that Eurasia’s major states could manage regional multipolarity peacefully without the American pacifier. Retrenchment would be a bet on this scholarship, particularly in regions where the kinds of stabilizers that nonrealist theories point to—such as democratic governance or dense institutional linkages—are either absent or weakly present. There are three other major bodies of scholarship, however, that might give decisionmakers pause before making this bet. First is regional expertise. Needless to say, there is no consensus on the net security effects of U.S. withdrawal. Regarding each region, there are optimists and pessimists. Few experts expect a return of intense great power competition in a post-American Europe, but many doubt European governments will pay the political costs of increased EU defense cooperation and the budgetary costs of increasing military outlays. 74 The result might be a Europe that is incapable of securing itself from various threats that could be destabilizing within the region and beyond (e.g., a regional conflict akin to the 1990s Balkan wars), lacks capacity for global security missions in which U.S. leaders might want European participation, and is vulnerable to the influence of outside rising powers. What about the other parts of Eurasia where the United States has a substantial military presence? Regarding the Middle East, the balance begins to swing toward pessimists concerned that states currently backed by Washington— notably Israel, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia—might take actions upon U.S. retrenchment that would intensify security dilemmas. And concerning East Asia, pessimism regarding the region’s prospects without the American pacifier is pronounced. Arguably the principal concern expressed by area experts is that Japan and South Korea are likely to obtain a nuclear capacity and increase their military commitments, which could stoke a destabilizing reaction from China. It is notable that during the Cold War, both South Korea and Taiwan moved to obtain a nuclear weapons capacity and were only constrained from doing so by a still-engaged United States. 75 The second body of scholarship casting doubt on the bet on defensive realism’s sanguine portrayal is all of the research that undermines its conception of state preferences. Defensive realism’s optimism about what would happen if the United States retrenched is very much dependent on its particular—and highly restrictive—assumption about state preferences; once we relax this assumption, then much of its basis for optimism vanishes. Specifically, the prediction of post-American tranquility throughout Eurasia rests on the assumption that security is the only relevant state preference, with security defined narrowly in terms of protection from violent external attacks on the homeland. Under that assumption, the security problem is largely solved as soon as offense and defense are clearly distinguishable, and offense is extremely expensive relative to defense. Burgeoning research across the social and other sciences, however, undermines that core assumption: states have preferences not only for security but also for prestige, status, and other aims, and they engage in trade-offs among the various objectives. 76 In addition, they define security not just in terms of territorial protection but in view of many and varied milieu goals. It follows that even states that are relatively secure may nevertheless engage in highly competitive behavior. Empirical studies show that this is indeed sometimes the case. 77 In sum, a bet on a benign postretrenchment Eurasia is a bet that leaders of major countries will never allow these nonsecurity preferences to influence their strategic choices. To the degree that these bodies of scholarly knowledge have predictive leverage, U.S. retrenchment would result in a significant deterioration in the security environment in at least some of the world’s key regions. We have already mentioned the third, even more alarming body of scholarship. Offensive realism predicts that the withdrawal of the American pacifier will yield either a competitive regional multipolarity complete with associated insecurity, arms racing, crisis instability, nuclear proliferation, and the like, or bids for regional hegemony, which may be beyond the capacity of local great powers to contain (and which in any case would generate intensely competitive behavior, possibly including regional great power war). Hence it is unsurprising that retrenchment advocates are prone to focus on the second argument noted above: that avoiding wars and security dilemmas in the world’s core regions is not a U.S. national interest. Few doubt that the United States could survive the return of insecurity and conflict among Eurasian powers, but at what cost? Much of the work in this area has focused on the economic externalities of a renewed threat of insecurity and war, which we discuss below. Focusing on the pure security ramifications, there are two main reasons why decisionmakers may be rationally reluctant to run the retrenchment experiment. First, overall higher levels of conflict make the world a more dangerous place. Were Eurasia to return to higher levels of interstate military competition, one would see overall higher levels of military spending and innovation and a higher likelihood of competitive regional proxy wars and arming of client states—all of which would be concerning, in part because it would promote a faster diffusion of military power away from the United States. Greater regional insecurity could well feed proliferation cascades, as states such as Egypt, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Saudi Arabia all might choose to create nuclear forces. 78 It is unlikely that proliferation decisions by any of these actors would be the end of the game: they would likely generate pressure locally for more proliferation. Following Kenneth Waltz, many retrenchment advocates are proliferation optimists, assuming that nuclear deterrence solves the security problem. 79 Usually carried out in dyadic terms, the debate over the stability of proliferation changes as the numbers go up. Proliferation optimism rests on assumptions of rationality and narrow security preferences. In social science, however, such assumptions are inevitably probabilistic. Optimists assume that most states are led by rational leaders, most will overcome organizational problems and resist the temptation to preempt before feared neighbors nuclearize, and most pursue only security and are risk averse. Confidence in such probabilistic assumptions declines if the world were to move from nine to twenty, thirty, or forty nuclear states. In addition, many of the other dangers noted by analysts who are concerned about the destabilizing effects of nuclear proliferation—including the risk of accidents and the prospects that some new nuclear powers will not have truly survivable forces—seem prone to go up as the number of nuclear powers grows. 80 Moreover, the risk of “unforeseen crisis dynamics” that could spin out of control is also higher as the number of nuclear powers increases. Finally, add to these concerns the enhanced danger of nuclear leakage, and a world with overall higher levels of security competition becomes yet more worrisome. The argument that maintaining Eurasian peace is not a U.S. interest faces a second problem. On widely accepted realist assumptions, acknowledging that U.S. engagement preserves peace dramatically narrows the difference between retrenchment and deep engagement. For many supporters of retrenchment, the optimal strategy for a power such as the United States, which has attained regional hegemony and is separated from other great powers by oceans, is offshore balancing: stay over the horizon and “pass the buck” to local powers to do the dangerous work of counterbalancing any local rising power. The United States should commit to onshore balancing only when local balancing is likely to fail and a great power appears to be a credible contender for regional hegemony, as in the cases of Germany, Japan, and the Soviet Union in the midtwentieth century. The problem is that China’s rise puts the possibility of its attaining regional hegemony on the table, at least in the medium to long term. As Mearsheimer notes, “The United States will have to play a key role in countering China, because its Asian neighbors are not strong enough to do it by themselves.” 81 Therefore, unless China’s rise stalls, “the United States is likely to act toward China similar to the way it behaved toward the Soviet Union during the Cold War.” 82 It follows that the United States should take no action that would compromise its capacity to move to onshore balancing in the future. It will need to maintain key alliance relationships in Asia as well as the formidably expensive military capacity to intervene there. The implication is to get out of Iraq and Afghanistan, reduce the presence in Europe, and pivot to Asia— just what the United States is doing. 83 In sum, the argument that U.S. security commitments are unnecessary for peace is countered by a lot of scholarship, including highly influential realist scholarship. In addition, the argument that Eurasian peace is unnecessary for U.S. security is weakened by the potential for a large number of nasty security consequences as well as the need to retain a latent onshore balancing capacity that dramatically reduces the savings retrenchment might bring. Moreover, switching between offshore and onshore balancing could well be difªcult. Bringing together the thrust of many of the arguments discussed so far underlines the degree to which the case for retrenchment misses the underlying logic of the deep engagement strategy. By supplying reassurance, deterrence, and active management, the United States lowers security competition in the world’s key regions, thereby preventing the emergence of a hothouse atmosphere for growing new military capabilities. Alliance ties dissuade partners from ramping up and also provide leverage to prevent military transfers to potential rivals. On top of all this, the United States’ formidable military machine may deter entry by potential rivals. Current great power military expenditures as a percentage of GDP are at historical lows, and thus far other major powers have shied away from seeking to match top-end U.S. military capabilities. In addition, they have so far been careful to avoid attracting the “focused enmity” of the United States. 84 All of the world’s most modern militaries are U.S. allies (America’s alliance system of more than sixty countries now accounts for some 80 percent of global military spending), and the gap between the U.S. military capability and that of potential rivals is by many measures growing rather than shrinking. 85</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>Contention 2<br/>Warming is happening and increasing now – the US is key to solve <br/>Passell ’12 (Peter Passell, a senior fellow at the Milken Institute in Santa Monica, as well as the editor of its quarterly journal on economic policy. “Two world one climate” May 23, 2012. <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/05/23/two_worlds_one_climate?page=fullandwp_login_redirect=0)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/05/23/two_worlds_one_climate?page=fullandwp_login_redirect=0)%27" tppabs="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/05/23/two_worlds_one_climate?page=fullandwp_login_redirect=0)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/05/23/two_worlds_one_climate?page=fullandwp_login_redirect=0)</span></a></span>&nbsp;</p><p>Climate change, we are often told, is everyone's problem. And without a lot of help containing greenhouse gas emissions from rapidly growing emerging market countries (not to mention a host of wannabes), the prospects of avoiding disaster are small to nil. Now you tell us, retort policymakers in the have-less countries: How convenient of you to discover virtue only after two centuries of growth and unfettered carbon emissions. Since you were the ones to get us into this mess, it's your job to get us out. (The United States' what-me-worry posture on climate change does not, of course, make the West's efforts to co-opt the moral high ground any more convincing.) This clash of wills is a bit more nuanced than that, but not much. Almost all the net growth in greenhouse gas emissions for the last two decades -- and more than half the total emissions today -- is coming from the developing world. What's more, most of the cheap opportunities for reducing emissions are to be found in the same countries. But as a matter of equity, it's hard to argue with "you've had your turn, now it's ours." And it's equally hard to see how the stalemate will be resolved before the world goes to hell in a plague of locusts (in some places, literally). The carbon emissions stats by country are startling, and would be even more startling if we had comprehensive numbers for years since 2009. Carbon emissions from OECD countries grew by 8 percent between 1990 and 2009, while emissions from the rest of the world grew by 73 percent (albeit from a smaller base). Breaking down the latter by country: China's emissions were up 207 percent, India's by 173 percent, Indonesia's by 165 percent, Vietnam's 563 percent (!!) and the Middle East's by 171 percent. If you have any doubts about where the emissions containment opportunities lie, consider this: In 2009, non-OECD countries generated four times as much carbon emissions per unit of GDP (at prevailing exchange rates) as OECD countries. Granted, these numbers don't look as bad if GDP is calculated in terms of purchasing power rather than exchange rates. But this is one of the few instances in which GDP comparisons at international exchange rates probably make more sense, because they offer better insight into a future in which consumption patterns across countries are likely to converge; that not-so-distant day when Indians drive cars to work instead of riding bicycles, and virtually everyone who experiences winter in emerging-market countries takes the chill off with central heating. But those focused on social justice rather than efficiency point to yet another set of numbers. While most developing countries waste fossil fuel because their heating, cooking, lighting and motorized transportation depend on older, fuel-guzzling technologies, they are still too poor to consume enough in total to leave much of a carbon footprint. Indeed, emissions per person in non-OECD countries are just 30 percent that of OECD countries. Bolivians, for example, emitted 1,300 kilos of CO2 per person in 2009, compared to 16,900 kilos per person in the United States. Resident of tropical Nigeria emitted a mere 266 kilos each, compared to 9,000 each in tropical Singapore. All told, those living in poor- and middle-income countries do emit more than half of all carbon emissions -- but only because there are so many of them. There's another element here that distinguishes developed from developing countries. If, as expected, climate change brings rising sea levels and more severe weather of every sort -- droughts, floods, hurricanes, tornados -- the rich countries will muddle through with dykes, crops redesigned to survive drought, more air conditioning and the like. It will be expensive, but manageable, unless global warming triggers truly destabilizing changes, like the release of vast quantities of methane gas from now-frozen arctic tundra. But the rich countries' travails may well be poor countries' damnation: the inundation of Pacific islands, catastrophic storm surges on the Bengal plain, the collapse of farm yields in semi-arid parts of Africa, and the spread of insect-vectored disease in the warmer, wetter parts. So, fair or not, poor countries have every reason to make emissions priority-one, right? Maybe, and maybe not. The iconoclastic, Nobel Prize winning economist Tom Schelling has long argued that our interests diverge from theirs. What poor countries need most, he says, is to invest in economic growth, which will give them the income to mitigate the consequences of climate change. Roads must be paved to prevent the isolation of rural areas in heavy rains; sea walls must be built to protect coastal cities; canals must be dug to irrigate drought-prone land; emergency infrastructure must be created to minimize loss of life in weather-related disasters. So poor countries would be foolish to divert scarce capital to emissions containment, which has only a "second-order" impact on their own welfare. Spending a dollar would, in effect, generate two cents' worth of benefits for themselves, and 98 cents' worth for the rest of the world. If all this sounds like a recipe for righteous posturing and diplomatic delay, go to the head of the class. Environmental policymakers and pundits, who once expected to build on the foundation of the Kyoto Treaty to create a truly collective effort to contain emissions, are now thinking smaller. The European Union, for example, is going its own way, investing heavily in emissions reduction in hope that others will be shamed into following its lead. The containment part is more or less working: European emissions declined by 12 percent between 1990 and 2009. But the shame part isn't. China is reducing emissions per unit of GDP, mostly as a consequence of adding productive capacity that is far more energy-efficient than "legacy" capacity. But it is nonetheless widening its lead as emitter number one because the GDP is growing so rapidly. And there is no sign that the other big emerging market economies are planning to mend their emitting ways. Must we then just accept the reality that the developing half of the global economy won't lend a hand in climate change containment? The rich countries might bully where blandishments fail, by imposing tariffs, for example, on imports that are less than green. Might, but probably won't: The United States, in particular, is in no position (geopolitical or financial) to complicate its relationships with either China or India. Besides, it's far from clear that such tariffs would meet the standards of the World Trade Organization. A more plausible option -- one that appeals in terms of both economic efficiency and social justice -- would be to buy their cooperation. Europe already has in place incentives for businesses to invest in emissions-sparing activities in developing countries: For example, paying landowners in Africa to sequester carbon by growing trees on scrubland. By the same token, one could imagine western governments paying their counterparts in the tropics to lock up forest land that would otherwise give way to logging and grazing. But the scale of such initiatives is probably limited by the inherent accounting ambiguities. How would you know, for example, that the forest wouldn't be preserved, anyway? Even more to the point, how would one verify that a government, paid to build natural-gas-fired power plants rather than coal ones, would have gone that way without the incentive? Arguably, the most promising approach to gaining the cooperation of emerging market countries lies in innovation. It wouldn't take much persuasion to get developing countries to adopt technologies that are climate-friendlier if they are also cheaper than emissions-as-usual. One could certainly imagine government-subsidized RandD that cut the cost of solar panels by 90 percent, or transformed the hydrogen-producing artificial leaf into a viable source of fuel. The idea of a global grand bargain in which emerging market countries would join the west in an ambitious, cost-minimizing containment program is dead. The best hope, at least for now, is a pragmatic search for common ground, one that appeals to the angels but relies on self-interest. A decade late and a trillion dollars short, you say?

In addition, EPA has made it a top priority thattransparency and accountabilitycontinue to guide the work of the BECC and NADB.¶ ¶ Recent Border Projects Since its inception in 1995, BECC has certified a total of 167 projects, 81 in the U.S. and 86 in Mexico, with an estimated cost of $3.65 billion to construct. Over the same time frame the NADB has contracted approximately $1.08 billion to partially finance 132 of these projects in the U.S.–Mexico border region.

The project consists of installing solar photovoltaic (PV) and thermal solar systems to benefitapproximately 1.34 million residents in San Diego County. Solar energy is one of the cleanest and most abundant renewable energy resources available.¶The program will provide “micro-bond” financing to individual property owners to implement photovoltaic solar, thermal solar, and energy efficiency systems in their homes. These systems will generate approximately 4,300 kilowatt-hours of electricity.¶With this $70.6 million program, every participating household will become more energy efficient, resulting in energy savings for the homeowners, as well asreducing greenhouse gas emissions, equivalent to some 6 tons of CO2 annually.¶ This effort will help to advance President Obama’s agenda related to creating new jobs in the clean energy economy, by driving the development of new, green jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced.<br/>Solar energy solves warming-alts to it increase the SQ problems<br/>Science Daily, 2007 (“Solar Energy Conversion Offers a Solution to Help Mitigate Global warming,” March 12, 2007, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/03/070307075611.htm_)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/03/070307075611.htm_)%27" tppabs="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/03/070307075611.htm_)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/03/070307075611.htm_)</span></a></span>&nbsp;</sub></p><p>Mar. 12, 2007 — Solar energy has the power to reduce greenhouse gases and provide increased energy efficiency, says a scientist at the U.S. Department of Energy's Argonne National Laboratory, in a report published in the March issue of Physics Today.<br/>Currently, between 80 percent and 85 percent of our energy comes from fossil fuels. However, fossil fuel resources are of finite extent and are distributed unevenly beneath Earth's surface. When fossil fuel is turned into useful energy through combustion, it often produces environmental pollutants that are harmful to human health and greenhouse gases that threaten the global climate.In contrast, solar resources are widely available and have a benign effect on the environment and climate, making it an appealing alternative energy source.<br/>“Sunlight is not only the most plentiful energy resource on earth, it is also one of the most versatile, converting readily to electricity, fuel and heat,” said Crabtree. “The challenge is to raise its conversion efficiency by factors of five or ten. That requires understanding the fundamental conversion phenomena at the nanoscale. We are just scratching the surface of this rich research field.”<br/>Warming is the most likely scenario for extinction<br/>Deibel 7 Terry L. Professor of IR @ National War College, 2007. “Foreign Affairs Strategy: Logic for American Statecraft”, Conclusion: American Foreign Affairs Strategy Today</p><p>Finally, there is one major existential threat to American security (as well as prosperity) of a nonviolent nature, which, though far in the future, demands urgent action. It is the threat of global warming to the stability of the climate upon which all earthly life depends. Scientists worldwide have been observing the gathering of this threat for three decades now, and what was once a mere possibility has passed through probability to near certainty. Indeed not one of more than 900 articles on climate change published in refereed scientific journals from 1993 to 2003 doubted that anthropogenic warming is occurring. “In legitimate scientific circles,” writes Elizabeth Kolbert, “it is virtually impossible to find evidence of disagreement over the fun<br/>damentals of global warming.” Evidence from a vast international scientific monitoring effort accumulates almost weekly, as this sample of newspaper reports shows: an international panel predicts “brutal droughts, floods and violent storms across the planet over the next century”; climate change could “literally alter ocean currents, wipe away huge portions of Alpine Snowcaps and aid the spread of cholera and malaria”; “glaciers in the Antarctic and in Greenland are melting much faster than expected, and…worldwide, plants are blooming several days earlier than a decade ago”; “rising sea temperatures have been accompanied by a significant global increase in the most destructive hurricanes”; “NASA scientists have concluded from direct temperature measurements that 2005 was the hottest year on record, with 1998 a close second”; “Earth’s warming climate is estimated to contribute to more than 150,000 deaths and 5 million illnesses each year” as disease spreads; “widespread bleaching from Texas to Trinidad…killed broad swaths of corals” due to a 2-degree rise in sea temperatures. “The world is slowly disintegrating,” concluded Inuit hunter Noah Metuq, who lives 30 miles from the Arctic Circle. “They call it climate change…but we just call it breaking up.” From the founding of the first cities some 6,000 years ago until the beginning of the industrial revolution, carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere remained relatively constant at about 280 parts per million (ppm). At present they are accelerating toward 400 ppm, and by 2050 they will reach 500 ppm, about double pre-industrial levels. Unfortunately, atmospheric CO2 lasts about a century, so there is no way immediately to reduce levels, only to slow their increase, we are thus in for significant global warming; the only debate is how much and how serous the effects will be. As the newspaper stories quoted above show, we are already experiencing the effects of 1-2 degree warming in more violent storms, spread of disease, mass die offs of plants and animals, species extinction, and threatened inundation of low-lying countries like the Pacific nation of Kiribati and the Netherlands at a warming of 5 degrees or less the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets could disintegrate, leading to a sea level of rise of 20 feet that would cover North Carolina’s outer banks, swamp the southern third of Florida, and inundate Manhattan up to the middle of Greenwich Village. Another catastrophic effect would be the collapse of the Atlantic thermohaline circulation that keeps the winter weather in Europe far warmer than its latitude would otherwise allow. Economist William Cline once estimated the damage to the United States alone from moderate levels of warming at 1-6 percent of GDP annually; severe warming could cost 13-26 percent of GDP. But the most frightening scenario is runaway greenhouse warming, based on positive feedback from the buildup of water vapor in the atmosphere that is both caused by and causes hotter surface temperatures. Past ice age transitions, associated with only 5-10 degree changes in average global temperatures, took place in just decades, even though no one was then pouring ever-increasing amounts of carbon into the atmosphere. Faced with this specter, the best one can conclude is that “humankind’s continuing enhancement of the natural greenhouse effect is akin to playing Russian roulette with the earth’s climate and humanity’s life support system. At worst, says physics professor Marty Hoffert of New York University, “we’re just going to burn everything up; we’re going to heat the atmosphere to the temperature it was in the Cretaceous when there were crocodiles at the poles, and then everything will collapse.” During the Cold War, astronomer Carl Sagan popularized a theory of nuclear winter to describe how a thermonuclear war between the Untied States and the Soviet Union would not only destroy both countries but possibly end life on this planet. Global warming is the post-Cold War era’s equivalent of nuclear winter at least as serious and considerably better supported scientifically. Over the long run it puts dangers form terrorism and traditional military challenges to shame. It is a threat not only to the security and prosperity to the United States, but potentially to the continued existence of life on this planet.<br/>US-Mexico cooperation solves – leads to global spillover <br/>Selee and Wilson ’12 (Andrew Selee, Wilson Center’s Vice President for Programs.

The U.S. government should continue to take advantage of the opportunities this creates for joint problem-solving. Mexico’s active participation in the G-20, which it hosted in 2012, and in the U.N. Framework on Climate Change, which it hosted in 2010, have helped spur this collaboration, and the recent accession of Mexico into the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations provides one obvious avenue to continue it. The two countries also coordinate more extensively than ever before on diplomatic issues, ranging from the breakdown of democratic order in Honduras to Iran’s nuclear ambitions. Mexico is likely to play an increasingly active role on global economic and environmental issues, areas where the country has significant experiences, and through cooperative efforts the U.S. can take advantage of Mexico’s role as a bridge between the developed and developing words, and &nbsp;between North America and Latin America. The bilateral agenda will remain critically important –and the increasingly deep integration of the two economies and societies means that efforts on trade, security, and migration will remain vital for the future of both countries. In addition, the maturation of the bilateral relationship means that it may one day resemble that between the United States and Canada, in which global issues can be as important as the strictly bilateral issues.

The turtles drown after being accidentally hooked on longline gear or entangled in gillnets; then they're thrown back into the sea, only to wash up dead on shore. Sea turtle deaths reached record levels last year, and alarmingly high stranding rates continued this spring. Scientists and conservationists have urged Mexico to close fishing areas where sea turtle habitat and risky gear overlap -- but Mexico has failed to take action. The United States and Mexico share this loggerhead sea turtle population, which is listed as endangered in both countries. Please, act now using the form below. Tell Mexico you're fed up with its bycatch and that you support U.S. trade sanctions if Mexico doesn't step up and stop the killing. Stop the Bycatch of Loggerhead Sea Turtles I am writing to ask Mexico to act now and halt the ongoing loggerhead sea turtle bycatch off Baja California Sur. As you know, for two decades scientists have documented turtles becoming hooked or entangled in the Gulf of Ulloa'slongline and gillnet fisheries. These fisheries kill an estimated 2,000 loggerheads each year. Last July 483 loggerheads were found stranded on just one stretch of beach -- a 600 percent increase over previous years' averages. And alarmingly high stranding rates have continued this spring. The United States and Mexico share the North Pacific loggerhead sea turtle population, which is listed as endangered in both countries. The United States has closed fishing areas where important sea turtle habitat and risky gear overlap and also requires its fishermen to adopt more sea turtle-friendly gear. Mexico can and must do the same -- or risk the population's extinction.If Mexico does not act, I fully support U.S. trade sanctions until Mexico reduces sea turtle mortality and adopts "comparable" turtle protection measures, as required by internationaltreaty and U.S. law. Sea turtles need protection on both sides of the border, and I urge Mexico to act now to save these ancient and vanishing animals.<br/>More investment in NADBank key to environment infrastructure – solves for environment sustainability and flora and fauna <br/>Kaplan and Hammacher, 00 – Gordan, attorney &nbsp;with the firm of Hillyer and.

The bank is limited by its charter to providing financing and other forms of assistance for projects in the area within 100 kilometers (about 62 miles) north and south of the U.S.-Mexican border. The charter further limits the bank's undertakings within this geographic area to "environmental infrastructure projects," which are defined as those "that will prevent, control or reduce environmental pollutants or contaminants, improve the drinking water supply, or protect flora and fauna so as to improve human health, promote sustainable development, or contribute to a higher quality of life." However, another charter provision directs that "preference" must be given to projects relating to water pollution, wastewater treatment, and municipal solid waste management. As a result of this charter directive, the bank's undertakings are confined as a practical matter to such "preferred" projects only. As of June, NADBank had authorized $265.4 million in loans and grants for 29 such projects on both sides of the border. These 29 projects, when completed, will involve a total cost and investment from private and public sources of $831.3 million. San Diego has received $17.2 million for the South Bay Water Reclamation Plant (total cost $99.6 million), while Tijuana has received $18.5 million for a sewage and wastewater treatment project to eliminate raw sewage flowing into the Tijuana River (total cost $19.5 million). Border Projects Other communities along the California/Mexico border have received $43.8 million for eight projects (total cost $127.1. million). Communities along the Texas/Mexico border have been the biggest beneficiaries of NADBank programs, receiving some $138.15 million for .13 projects (total cost $518.86 million). NADBank has clearly demonstrated an ability to leverage the capital resources available to it into considerably greater total financing for projects. But the bank could do much more if it were not constrained by a mandate which imposes a limited geographic scope on its activities and requires it to focus narrowly on projects involving water pollution, wastewater treatment and municipal solid waste management. This restricted mandate results in under-utilization of NADBank's lending capacity, which severely limits the bank's ability to generate revenues and provide for future loans and grants, which translates overall into less funds being available for the infrastructure needs of the border-region communities NADBank is supposed to serve. At present, NADBank's total lending capacity of some $2 billion has been virtually untouched. The bank's own loans for the 29 projects mentioned above total only $11.12 million. Too Few Projects The bank has had to rely on grants for the balance of the $265.4 million authorized for these projects largely because most of the communities involved are poor, with little ability to repay debt. Moreover, the bank's projections for the next decade indicate that viable projects in the water and municipal solid waste sectors will never use more than 10 percent of its lending capacity, also because most of the communities involved will be too poor to afford loan programs. If NADBank continues to be constrained by the narrow terms of its existing mandate, it appears destined to become a stagnant institution, of little relevance to the developmental needs of the border region, even as these needs grow and become more urgent. The population of the border region is projected to increase by 50 percent over the next 20 years. Sustainable development in the face of this kind of population growth cannot be had simply by concentrating on water and municipal solid waste projects. Expanded Mandate Proposed NADBank has, therefore, proposed an expanded mandate which would create a much larger and more economically viable lending market and enable the bank to address a wide variety of infrastructure needs in the region. A proposed geographic extension of the mandate to 300 kilometers on either side of the border would allow the inclusion of many additional communities that are naturally affected by growth along the border, and whose economies are often directly tied to the border-region economy. It would increase the population covered by NADBank's mandate from the current 10.6 million to 41 million and include such major population centers as Los Angeles, Phoenix and San Antonio on .the U.S. side, and Hermosillo, Chihuahua, Saltillo and Monterrey on the Mexican side. NADBank has also proposed changes to its mandate which would give the bank flexibility to undertake an assortment of infrastructure projects in order to diversify lending prospects and meet the broader developmental needs and environmental concerns of border-region communities. Greater Range Of Projects Under this more flexible mandate, NADBank would be able to engage in a range of projects extending well beyond the narrow focus of its existing mandate. This new range of projects could include, for example: • Industrial and hazardous waste treatment projects for maquiladoras and other industries; • Urban transportation and mass transit projects; • Affordable housing and housing improvement programs; • Air quality projects; • Agricultural and municipal water conservation projects; • Home water and wastewater installation programs; • Energy projects from biomass and wind, geothermal, and solar power. An expanded mandate for NADBank makes good sense for the future prosperity and growth of the San Diego/Tijuana region. NADBank projects promote sustainable development and enhance the quality of life of people in our region.</p><p>Destruction of the sea turtle population leads to a domino effect – brink is now. <br/>Todd Steiner, xx-xx-2010, Sea Turtle Restoration Project, Executive Director at Turtle Island Restoration Network, San Francisco Bay Area, “Are Sea Turtles Worth Saving?” <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.bonaireturtles.org/explore/are-sea-turtles-worth-saving/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.bonaireturtles.org/explore/are-sea-turtles-worth-saving/%27" tppabs="http://www.bonaireturtles.org/explore/are-sea-turtles-worth-saving/"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.bonaireturtles.org/explore/are-sea-turtles-worth-saving/</span></a></span></p><p>Sea turtles demonstrate the ultimate lesson of ecology – that everything is connected. Sea turtles are part of two vital ecosystems, beaches and marine systems. If sea turtles become extinct, both the marine and beach ecosystems will weaken. And since humans use the ocean as an important source for food and use beaches for many kinds of activities, weakness in these ecosystems would have harmful effects on humans. Though sea turtles have been living and thriving in the world’s oceans for 150 million years, they are now in danger of extinction largely because of changes brought about by humans. If we alter the oceans and beaches enough to wipe out sea turtles, will those changes make it difficult for us to survive? And if we choose to do what’s necessary to save sea turtles, might we save our own future? Beaches and dune systems do not get very many nutrients during the year, so very little vegetation grows on the dunes and no vegetation grows on the beach itself. This is because sand does not hold nutrients very well. Sea turtles use beaches and the lower dunes to nest and lay their eggs. Sea turtles lay around 100 eggs in a nest and lay between 3 and 7 nests during the summer nesting season. Not every nest will hatch, not every egg in a nest will hatch, and not all of the hatchlings in a nest will make it out of the nest. All the unhatched nests, eggs and trapped hatchlings are very good sources of nutrients for the dune vegetation. Even the left-over egg shells from hatched eggs provide nutrients. Dune plants use the nutrients from turtle eggs to grow and become stronger. As the dune vegetation grows stronger and healthier, the health of the entire beach/dune ecosystem becomes better. Healthy vegetation and strong root systems hold the sand in the dunes and protect the beach from erosion. As the number of turtles declines, fewer eggs are laid in the beaches, providing less nutrients. If sea turtles went extinct, dune vegetation would lose a major source of nutrients and would not be healthy or strong enough to maintain the dunes, allowing beaches to wash away. Sea turtles eat jellyfish, preventing the large “blooms” of jellyfish – including stinging jellyfish – that are increasingly wreaking havoc on fisheries, recreation and other maritime activities throughout the oceans. Research has shown that sea turtles often act as keystonespecies. Sea grass beds grazed by green sea turtles are more productive than those that aren’t. Hawksbill turtles eat sponges, preventing them from out-competing slow-growing corals. Both of these grazing activities maintain species diversity and the natural balance of fragile marine ecosystems. If sea turtles go extinct, it will cause declines in all the species whose survival depends on healthy seagrass beds and coral reefs. That means that many marine species that humans harvest would be lost. Sea turtles, and many species that are affected by their presence or absence, are an important attraction for marine tourism, a major source of income for many countries. These are some of the roles that we knowseaturtles play in the essential health of ecosystems. Who knows what other roles we will discover as science reveals more about sea turtles? While humans have the ability to tinker with the “clockwork” of life, we don’t have the ability to know when it’s okay to lose a few of the working parts. If you disagree, try to take apart a clock and just throw away one of the pieces that doesn’t look that important. Put the clock back together and see if it still works.<br/>Loggerhead turtles are keystone species – key to global marine ecosystems.<br/>Coastal Breeze, 8-23-2012, locally owned and operated bi-weekly community newspaper, “Sea Turtle Tidbits,” <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.coastalbreezenews.com/2012/08/23/sea-turtle-tidbits-6/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.coastalbreezenews.com/2012/08/23/sea-turtle-tidbits-6/%27" tppabs="http://www.coastalbreezenews.com/2012/08/23/sea-turtle-tidbits-6/"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.coastalbreezenews.com/2012/08/23/sea-turtle-tidbits-6/</span></a></span></p><p>There are five species of sea turtles that nest on Florida’s beaches. The most common is the loggerhead. The green turtle and leatherback are also found frequenting beaches throughout the state. The Kemp’s ridley and hawksbill sea turtles nest in Florida but not very often. All five species are listed as either threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act.Sea turtles are considered to be a keystone species within their ecosystems. The extinction of any one of the many sea turtle species would affect many other organisms within both beach systems and marine systems. Loggerhead sea turtles are considered a keystone species because their eggs actually nourish grass dunes along beaches. They are often referred to as floating reefs because their shells act as a home to as many as 100 different species such as barnacles, small fish, algae and shrimp.The green sea turtle is essential to the health of sea grass beds. Those that are grazed by the green sea turtle are much healthier and balanced than beds that are not. Hawksbill turtles are known for eating sponges which prevents them from overtaking slower growing corals in reef systems. Sea turtles also eat jellyfish, helping to stabilize their population.The necessity of the sea turtle is recognized by The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission’s Fish and Wildlife Research Institute. It coordinates two different sea turtle monitoring programs: the Statewide Nesting Beach Survey and the Index Nesting Beach Survey.

For example, besides significant tourism values - the most economically valuable ecosystem service coral reefs provide, worldwide - coral reefs protect against storms and dampen other environmental fluctuations, services worth more than ten times the reefs' value for food production. n856 Waste treatment is another significant, non-extractive ecosystem function that intact coral reef ecosystems provide. n857 More generally, "ocean ecosystems play a major role in the global geochemical cycling of all the elements that represent the basic building blocks of living organisms, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur, as well as other less abundant but necessary elements." n858 In a very real and direct sense, therefore, human degradation of marine ecosystems impairs the planet's ability to support life. Maintaining biodiversity is often critical to maintaining the functions of marine ecosystems. Current evidence shows that, in general, an ecosystem's ability to keep functioning in the face of disturbance is strongly dependent on its biodiversity, "indicating that more diverse ecosystems are more stable." n859 Coral reef ecosystems are particularly dependent on their biodiversity. &nbsp;*265 &nbsp;&nbsp;Most ecologists agree that the complexity of interactions and degree of interrelatedness among component species is higher on coral reefs than in any other marine environment. This implies that the ecosystem functioning that produces the most highly valued components is also complex and that many otherwise insignificant species have strong effects on sustaining the rest of the reef system. n860Thus, maintaining and restoring the biodiversity of marine ecosystems is critical to maintaining and restoring the ecosystem services that they provide. Non-use biodiversity values for marine ecosystems have been calculated in the wake of marine disasters, like the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska. n861 Similar calculations could derive preservation values for marine wilderness. However, economic value, or economic value equivalents, should not be "the sole or even primary justification for conservation of ocean ecosystems. Ethical arguments also have considerable force and merit." n862 At the forefront of such arguments should be a recognition of how little we know about the sea - and about the actual effect of human activities on marine ecosystems. The United States has traditionally failed to protect marine ecosystems because it was difficult to detect anthropogenic harm to the oceans, but we now know that such harm is occurring - even though we are not completely sure about causation or about how to fix every problem. Ecosystems like the NWHI coral reef ecosystem should inspire lawmakers and policymakers to admit that most of the time we really do not know what we are doing to the sea and hence should be preserving marine wilderness whenever we can - especially when the United States has within its territory relativelypristine marine ecosystems that may be unique in the world. We may not know much about the sea, but we do know this much: if we kill the ocean we kill ourselves, and we will take most of the biosphere with us.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>Solvency<br/>Expanding the NADBank solves infrastructure development — the plan ensures accountability, private investment, and Mexico says yes.<br/>Rodriguez 9 — Raul Rodriguez, serves as the Chairman of the Board of Advisors of the North American Center for Transborder Studies at Arizona State University. He is also the Benson Chair in Banking and Finance and Distinguished Professor at the HEB School of Business and Administration at the University of the Incarnate Word in San Antonio, Texas and the President of RMI, an investment and trade consulting firm in Mexico. He served as CEO and Managing Director of the North American Development Bank (NADBank) until October 2005. Prior to joining the NADBank, he was Executive Director of the Mexican Foreign Trade Bank; the Bank's Director for Asia; Mexico's Trade Commissioner in Canada during the NAFTA negotiation; and Secretary of Economic Development for the Mexican border State of Tamaulipas. Mr. Rodriguez participates actively in community affairs at home in San Antonio, Texas, as Chairman of the World Affairs Council; Chairman Elect of The Free Trade Alliance; Mayoral appointee to the Board of Directors of the Port Authority of San Antonio; Chairman Elect and Vice President of the San Antonio - Mexico Friendship Council, among others. He is also a founding member of the Mexican Council on Foreign Relations and a member of the Advisory Council of the Harte Research Institute at Texas AandM University, the North American Forum, the U.S. - Mexico Futures Forum and the Border Trade Advisory Committee of the Texas Transportation Commission.

Prevailing political thinking in Washington—and to a certain extent in Mexico City—and the current economic situation are not conducive to creating supranational structures; so while Europe bursts with a cumbersome and bloated institutional life, North America remains anemic by comparison. ¶ Its mere existence and capacity for reform given its small size and overheadmake NADB a valuable asset. Only an accountable and trusted institutional body with a mandate on both sides of the border and subject to bilateral oversightwill allow for further resource transfers and productive interaction. With its track record of tackling difficult sectors and its untapped potential, NADB could truly become the long overdue border bank. It is time for NADB and its mandate to reach beyond the environment to other areas where it can be a vital funding and capacity-building instrument. ¶ Mexico has sought a broader mandate for NADB since 2000. President Felipe Calderón has acknowledged its value and the need to continue expanding its role. He has underscored the “very positive outcomes” of NADB financing; his “commitment to promote” further “reforms of the Bank’s mandate” in order to “eliminate restrictions and improve its operations”; and the need to increase single obligor limits and to expand the mandate to cover “infrastructure projects in general”, and not just environmental projects (speech at the VI National Convention, American Chamber of Commerce; February 27, 2007). ¶ Some progress has been made along Pres. Calderon’s line of thinking. In 2008 the Bank authorized increasing the single-obligor limit, as well as financing for a new type of air quality improvement project: border crossing infrastructure. NADB’s role also fits within President Barack Obama’s agenda in terms of the critical importance of infrastructure development, the need to tend to border issues, and the structuring of more positive and comprehensive cooperative efforts with Mexico. Both federal governments are sponsoring infrastructure programs along the border as part of their economic stimulus initiatives that will render synergies if closely coordinated. ¶ A drawn-out debate has taken place among environmentalists along the border who would like BECC and NADB to continue concentrated on their current mandate and those who believe they should cater to much broader infrastructure needs and an extended jurisdiction. There is a valid argument in making sure these institutions remain focused and clearly there is still much to do environmentally. But there is a wider range of needs along the border that require urgent attention, face decreasing government funding, and are not profitable enough to be financed by commercial banks or the private sector. Addressing these needs would not only have a high impact on the quality of life of the population but would also foster job creation and economic development. In addition, covering more profitable sectors would enhance the Bank’s ability to respond to projects lacking credit capacity.¶ Below are ten of the actions and policy initiatives that have been debated in recent years with regard to achieving an expanded and more effective role for NADB: ¶ A. Expand the mandate to include additional infrastructure sectors: ¶ The Bank requires a more flexible mandate that takes into account a broader set of criteria that do not focus excessively on quantifiable environmental benefits. Currently the Board sets very high environmental benefit thresholds on projects. Factors relating to the broader goals of infrastructure improvement and economic development should be considered in addition to environmental criteria in a balanced way. ¶ Some sectors are more amenable than others for bilateral cooperation. Water—and environmental infrastructure in general—has been a must in view of its strategic importance as a shared and scarce resource on both sides of the border and given its growing complexity. Transportation and logistics, among other areas, is a natural choice: fostering the corridors concept, linking inland port projects and facilities on both sides, helping address the tradeoffs with security measures, promoting customs systems and bridge and road projects that have faced endless delays. Maximizing the use of current infrastructure and addressing mismanagement, coordination and harmonization issues should continue to be part of NADB’s focus. ¶ The Bank should become more fully engaged with the development and expansion of ports of entry and border crossings. In the context of security imperatives, investments aimed at facilitating the construction and improvement of crossings through public-private partnerships might be the most important contribution to the border’s development today. ¶ The need for legislation to authorize further expansion into other infrastructure sectors has been debated. Some suggest it is simply an issue for the governments to resolve. However, given the restrictive interpretations of the charter, if a favorable legislative climate develops its amendment would be advisable if broad mandate expansion were to be considered. ¶ A lingering question is how much of a BECC certification process should be applied to projects in new sectors. Public and stakeholder participation in project development, approval and support has been a fundamental contribution of BECC over the years, but there is a concern—particularly among private sector investors—that it delays the funding process unduly. Expedited NADB lending approval processes will also be critical in order to foster more private sector participation. ¶ As new sectors are addressed, it will be crucial to find even more creative ways to mitigate risks, foster long-term financing in the local currency, and leverage funds from different sources. A key role for the NADB will be to help enhance project conditions and provide guarantees in order to link with private financial markets where affordable long-term funds in a multi-year programming context might be available.</p></div></div></td><td>11/2/13</td></tr></table><div id="divHiddenCites" style="display: none;">
