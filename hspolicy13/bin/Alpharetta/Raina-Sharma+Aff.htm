But Romney's <br/>AND<br/>secure and prosperous even as economic and military strength spreads to new quarters.<br/>President Barack Obama is on the correct path. Leaving Iraq and overseeing a paced <br/>AND<br/>the president's pledge to focus on "nation-building here at home."<br/>Romney has already denigrated Obama's pragmatism, charging that "our president thinks America is <br/>AND<br/>speaks directly to an electorate yearning for more equity and prosperity at home.<br/>According to a recent Pew Research Center survey, 46 percent of Americans want the <br/>AND<br/>But Obama's commitment to nation-building at home will play even better.<br/>Even if Romney's rhetoric were to get more domestic traction, it would still bear no resemblance to the new global landscape that is fast emerging. The United States is indeed an exceptional nation -- in its prized geographic location, commitment to freedom and democracy, and brand of international leadership. But the country's exceptionalism should not be used as an excuse to hide from global realities.<br/>China's GDP will catch up with America's over the course of the next decade. <br/>AND<br/>years ahead. Nonetheless, a more level global playing field is inevitable.<br/>To be sure, America's military superiority will remain second to none for decades to <br/>AND<br/>be at least as important as raw power in ensuring the country's security.<br/>To acknowledge the need for the United States to adjust to prospective shifts in the global distribution of power is not, as Duke University professor Bruce Jentleson recently pointed out in Democracy, to be a declinist or a pessimist. It is to be a realist. And safely guiding the United States through this coming transition requires seeing the world as it is rather than retreating toward the illusory comfort of denial.<br/>Adjusting to the rise of the rest requires, for starters, making more room at the table for newcomers. That process is already well under way. The G-20 has supplanted the G-8, widening the circle for global consultations. In the aftermath of reforms adopted in 2010, developing countries now have enhanced weight at the World Bank and IMF. The enlargement of the U.N. Security Council, though currently bogged down in wrangling, is also in the offing.<br/>But making international institutions more representative is the easy part. More challenging will be managing the ideological diversity that will accompany the coming realignment in global power.

This paper will further define our interests in Cuba and why President Obama should continue his quest for renewed diplomatic relations with Cuba. It will discuss potential risks associated with retaining the current 50-year diplomatic policy and give some broad suggestions regarding a new U.S. – Cuba foreign policy.<br/>Policy and National Interest<br/>Present U.S. policy towards Cuba is economic isolation imposed via embargo to <br/>AND<br/>Cuba policy, past opportunities and ultimate failure over the past 50 years. <br/>From 1959 to1964, beginning with President Eisenhower but shaped primarily by the Kennedy Administration<br/>AND<br/>by 1974, 45 of Cuba’s exports came from western governments.7<br/>The period 1965-1972, although officially endorsing the previous administration’s tough stance, <br/>AND<br/>” in 1980 intensified this opposition and quickly derailed Carter’s initiatives in Congress.<br/>As President Reagan took office in 1980, U.S. – Cuba relations <br/>AND<br/>Administrations made no significant concessions to Cuba and status quo between countries remained. <br/>The last meaningful opportunity for change occurred after the fall of the Berlin Wall and <br/>AND<br/>allow third country U.S. companies from trading with Cuba.15<br/>By the time President Clinton came to office, momentum had already shifted in Cuba’s <br/>AND<br/>tighten the noose failed terribly and only succeeded in further alienating both governments.<br/>The second Bush Administration did little to engage Cuba and after September 11, 2001, was completely engrossed in the War on Terror. U.S. policy towards Cuba has changed little in 50 years. Although the embargo continues to fail despite our best efforts to tighten it, our policy has remained steadfast and the U.S. is no closer to normalizing relations with Cuba.<br/>A History of Anger and Distrust<br/>After 50 years, deep-seated distrust and anger exists between the U.<br/>AND<br/>conditions for diplomatic success in future U.S. – Cuba relations. <br/>Experts argue over who’s started the dispute between nations: was it the Cuban Agrarian <br/>AND<br/>encourage the long-term changes U.S. wants in Cuba. <br/>The embargo itself remains a perpetual albatross that continues to undermine any real diplomatic progress <br/>AND<br/>.S. had succeeded in isolating Cuba from its western traders.20<br/>Tightening the noose placed extraordinary economic pressure on Cuba considering U.S. multilateral <br/>AND<br/>, and Asian countries participated in Cuba’s largest ever annual trade fair.”26<br/>Castro’s interest in improving U.S. - Cuba relations was perhaps the greatest <br/>AND<br/>now largely ineffective bilateral embargo served only to increase animosity between both countries.<br/>It is difficult to quantify, but essential to note, that U.S<br/>AND<br/>U.S. national interests and not the legacy of Fidel Castro.<br/>Another important pitfall is to exploit democracy as a precondition for diplomacy and economic engagement <br/>AND<br/>28 The recommendation then focuses largely on steps to pursue a democratic Cuba. <br/>To separate security and stability from democratic pursuits in Cuba could benefit both causes. <br/>AND<br/>generation to open dialogue with Cuba without the democratic preconditions tied to negotiations. <br/>As we pursue diplomatic relations with Cuba we should not expect full disclosure, immediate <br/>AND<br/>is needed until Cuba has the confidence to commit to further diplomatic relations. <br/>Current U.S.-Cuba Policy Analysis<br/>Understanding the deep-seated animosity and distrust that continues to fuel U.S. - Cuba tensions will aid us in properly analyzing the feasibility, acceptability and suitability (FAS) of current and future U.S. policy with Cuba. Identifying FAS applications to diplomacy, information, military, economic, finance, intelligence and law enforcement (DIME-FIL) will highlight weaknesses in current U.S. – Cuba relations that can be modified for future improvement. <br/>The logical question with regards to current U.S. – Cuba policy is <br/>AND<br/>. to pursue the current course there is no evidence it will succeed.<br/>How acceptable is it to U.S. foreign policy? There are three <br/>AND<br/>. acceptability is necessary to achieve U.S. ends in Cuba.<br/>Several embargo refinements over the years like the Libertad Act have further tightened restrictions on <br/>AND<br/>, our efforts to impose embargo restrictions are unacceptable tradeoffs for homeland security.<br/>In the final analysis, U.S. – Cuba policy is not sustainable <br/>AND<br/>foregone diplomatic engagement and chosen coercive economic power as our only political tool.<br/>Does Cuba Pose A Security Threat to the U.S.?<br/>Let’s begin by asking this question: can we afford to escort commerce through Caribbean <br/>AND<br/>are definite advantages to having healthy regional partnerships to deal with regional problems. <br/>While economic pressure has failed to bring about government change, it could trigger a <br/>AND<br/>not exist for real change in U.S. – Cuba relations.<br/>Proposed U.S.-Cuba Policy Analysis<br/>If today marks President Obama’s “new strategy” towards Cuba we must begin with U.S. National interests in the broader Latin American context. Over the past 50 years our approach has been germane to Cuba and not the larger Latin American construct. In so doing we have isolated Cuba from Latin America for coercive reasons yes, but also for the very democratic principles we hoped Cuba would follow. <br/>The State Department’s Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs (covers Canada and Cuba) has <br/>AND<br/>conditions and exposing them to the democratic enticements we hope they will emulate.<br/>Achieving Congressional approval will be difficult although not impossible in the present economic recession. <br/>AND<br/>these to the American public before the media or his opposition defines these.<br/>We’ve established that coercive means have failed to achieve democracy and economic stability in Cuba<br/>AND<br/>U.S. shepherding, lead them to a more representative government. <br/>If we accept that reestablishing relations with Cuba is the first real step to a <br/>AND<br/>to allow time to reap success or mitigate failure before the next elections.<br/>The U.S. cannot afford to miss another opportunity to normalize relations with Cuba. A Cuba without Fidel is an opportunity – whether it is Raul or his replacement in 2013. The U.S. must lay the foundation today for renewed U.S. Cuba relations.

This legacy dates from the Monroe Doctrine, articulated in 1823, through the Rio pact, the postwar treaty that pledged the United States to come to the defense of its allies in Central and South America.<br/>Yet for a half-century, our policies toward our southern neighbors have alternated between intervention and neglect, inappropriate meddling and missed opportunities. The death this week of President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela — who along with Fidel Castro of Cuba was perhaps the most vociferous critic of the United States among the political leaders of the Western Hemisphere in recent decades — offers an opportunity to restore bonds with potential allies who share the American goal of prosperity.<br/>Throughout his career, the autocratic Mr. Chávez used our embargo as a wedge with which to antagonize the United States and alienate its supporters. His fuel helped prop up the rule of Mr. Castro and his brother Raúl, Cuba’s current president. The embargo no longer serves any useful purpose (if it ever did at all); President Obama should end it, though it would mean overcoming powerful opposition from Cuban-American lawmakers in Congress.<br/>An end to the Cuba embargo would send a powerful signal to all of Latin America that the United States wants a new, warmer relationship with democratic forces seeking social change throughout the Americas.<br/>I joined the State Department as a Foreign Service officer in the 1950s and chose <br/>AND<br/>region since the end of Spanish and Portuguese rule in the 19th century.<br/>Kennedy had a charisma of his own, and it captured the imaginations of leaders <br/>AND<br/>D. Roosevelt and transformed the whole concept of inter-American relations.<br/>Tragically, after Kennedy’s assassination in 1963, the ideal of the Alliance for Progress crumbled and “la noche mas larga” — “the longest night” — began for the proponents of Latin American democracy. Military regimes flourished, democratic governments withered, moderate political and civil leaders were labeled Communists, rights of free speech and assembly were curtailed and human dignity crushed, largely because the United States abandoned all standards save that of anti-Communism.<br/>During my Foreign Service career, I did what I could to oppose policies that supported dictators and closed off democratic alternatives. In 1981, as the ambassador to El Salvador, I refused a demand by the secretary of state, Alexander M. Haig Jr., that I use official channels to cover up the Salvadoran military’s responsibility for the murders of four American churchwomen. I was fired and forced out of the Foreign Service.<br/>The Reagan administration, under the illusion that Cuba was the power driving the Salvadoran revolution, turned its policy over to the Pentagon and C.I.A., with predictable results. During the 1980s the United States helped expand the Salvadoran military, which was dominated by uniformed assassins. We armed them, trained them and covered up their crimes.<br/>After our counterrevolutionary efforts failed to end the Salvadoran conflict, the Defense Department asked <br/>AND<br/>and at a cost disproportionate to any conventional conception of the national interest.”<br/>Over the subsequent quarter-century, a series of profound political, social and <br/>AND<br/>States — which excludes the United States and Canada — as an alternative.<br/>At a regional meeting that included Cuba and excluded the United States, Mr. Chávez said that “the most positive thing for the independence of our continent is that we meet alone without the hegemony of empire.”<br/>Mr. Chávez was masterful at manipulating America’s antagonism toward Fidel Castro as a rhetorical stick with which to attack the United States as an imperialist aggressor, an enemy of progressive change, interested mainly in treating Latin America as a vassal continent, a source of cheap commodities and labor.<br/>Like its predecessors, the Obama administration has given few signs that it has grasped the magnitude of these changes or cares about their consequences. After President Obama took office in 2009, Latin America’s leading statesman at the time, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, then the president of Brazil, urged Mr. Obama to normalize relations with Cuba.<br/>Lula, as he is universally known, correctly identified our Cuba policy as the chief stumbling block to renewed ties with Latin America, as it had been since the very early years of the Castro regime.<br/>After the failure of the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion, Washington set out to accomplish by stealth and economic strangulation what it had failed to do by frontal attack. But the clumsy mix of covert action and porous boycott succeeded primarily in bringing shame on the United States and turning Mr. Castro into a folk hero.<br/>And even now, despite the relaxing of travel restrictions and Raúl Castro’s announcement that <br/>AND<br/>Committee, but his power has been weakened by a continuing ethics controversy.)<br/>Are there any other examples in the history of diplomacy where the leaders of a small, weak nation can prevent a great power from acting in its own best interest merely by staying alive?<br/>The re-election of President Obama, and the death of Mr. Chávez<br/>AND<br/>president is prepared to show some flexibility on Cuba and asks your help.<br/>Such a simple request could transform the Cuban issue from a bilateral problem into a multilateral challenge. It would then be up to Latin Americans to devise a policy that would help Cuba achieve a sufficient measure of democratic change to justify its reintegration into a hemisphere composed entirely of elected governments.<br/>If, however, our present policy paralysis continues, we will soon see the emergence of two rival camps, the United States versus Latin America. While Washington would continue to enjoy friendly relations with individual countries like Brazil, Mexico and Colombia, the vision of Roosevelt and Kennedy of a hemisphere of partners cooperating in matters of common concern would be reduced to a historical footnote.</p><p>Increased regional standing bolsters influence in international institutions allowing the US to lead multilateral forums<br/>Sabatini and Berger 12 – Christopher Sabatini is editor-in-chief of Americas Quarterly and senior director of policy at Americas Society/Council of the Americas.

Security Council, though currently bogged down in wrangling, is also in the offing.<br/>But making international institutions more representative is the easy part.

Although the embargo continues to fail despite our best efforts to tighten it, our policy has remained steadfast and the U.S. is no closer to normalizing relations with Cuba.<br/>A History of Anger and Distrust<br/>After 50 years, deep-seated distrust and anger exists between the U.<br/>AND<br/>conditions for diplomatic success in future U.S. – Cuba relations. <br/>Experts argue over who’s started the dispute between nations: was it the Cuban Agrarian <br/>AND<br/>encourage the long-term changes U.S. wants in Cuba. <br/>The embargo itself remains a perpetual albatross that continues to undermine any real diplomatic progress <br/>AND<br/>.S. had succeeded in isolating Cuba from its western traders.20<br/>Tightening the noose placed extraordinary economic pressure on Cuba considering U.S. multilateral <br/>AND<br/>, and Asian countries participated in Cuba’s largest ever annual trade fair.”26<br/>Castro’s interest in improving U.S. - Cuba relations was perhaps the greatest <br/>AND<br/>now largely ineffective bilateral embargo served only to increase animosity between both countries.<br/>It is difficult to quantify, but essential to note, that U.S<br/>AND<br/>U.S. national interests and not the legacy of Fidel Castro.<br/>Another important pitfall is to exploit democracy as a precondition for diplomacy and economic engagement <br/>AND<br/>28 The recommendation then focuses largely on steps to pursue a democratic Cuba. <br/>To separate security and stability from democratic pursuits in Cuba could benefit both causes. <br/>AND<br/>generation to open dialogue with Cuba without the democratic preconditions tied to negotiations. <br/>As we pursue diplomatic relations with Cuba we should not expect full disclosure, immediate <br/>AND<br/>is needed until Cuba has the confidence to commit to further diplomatic relations. <br/>Current U.S.-Cuba Policy Analysis<br/>Understanding the deep-seated animosity and distrust that continues to fuel U.S. - Cuba tensions will aid us in properly analyzing the feasibility, acceptability and suitability (FAS) of current and future U.S. policy with Cuba. Identifying FAS applications to diplomacy, information, military, economic, finance, intelligence and law enforcement (DIME-FIL) will highlight weaknesses in current U.S. – Cuba relations that can be modified for future improvement. <br/>The logical question with regards to current U.S. – Cuba policy is <br/>AND<br/>. to pursue the current course there is no evidence it will succeed.<br/>How acceptable is it to U.S. foreign policy? There are three <br/>AND<br/>. acceptability is necessary to achieve U.S. ends in Cuba.<br/>Several embargo refinements over the years like the Libertad Act have further tightened restrictions on <br/>AND<br/>, our efforts to impose embargo restrictions are unacceptable tradeoffs for homeland security.<br/>In the final analysis, U.S. – Cuba policy is not sustainable <br/>AND<br/>foregone diplomatic engagement and chosen coercive economic power as our only political tool.<br/>Does Cuba Pose A Security Threat to the U.S.?<br/>Let’s begin by asking this question: can we afford to escort commerce through Caribbean <br/>AND<br/>are definite advantages to having healthy regional partnerships to deal with regional problems. <br/>While economic pressure has failed to bring about government change, it could trigger a <br/>AND<br/>not exist for real change in U.S. – Cuba relations.<br/>Proposed U.S.-Cuba Policy Analysis<br/>If today marks President Obama’s “new strategy” towards Cuba we must begin with U.S. National interests in the broader Latin American context. Over the past 50 years our approach has been germane to Cuba and not the larger Latin American construct. In so doing we have isolated Cuba from Latin America for coercive reasons yes, but also for the very democratic principles we hoped Cuba would follow. <br/>The State Department’s Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs (covers Canada and Cuba) has <br/>AND<br/>conditions and exposing them to the democratic enticements we hope they will emulate.<br/>Achieving Congressional approval will be difficult although not impossible in the present economic recession. <br/>AND<br/>these to the American public before the media or his opposition defines these.<br/>We’ve established that coercive means have failed to achieve democracy and economic stability in Cuba<br/>AND<br/>U.S. shepherding, lead them to a more representative government. <br/>If we accept that reestablishing relations with Cuba is the first real step to a <br/>AND<br/>to allow time to reap success or mitigate failure before the next elections.<br/>The U.S. cannot afford to miss another opportunity to normalize relations with Cuba. A Cuba without Fidel is an opportunity – whether it is Raul or his replacement in 2013. The U.S. must lay the foundation today for renewed U.S. Cuba relations. Delaying could also signal the contrary to Raul Castro suspiciously awaiting the true purpose of recent U.S. concessions.<br/>While a long term goal may be to influence change in government, it cannot <br/>AND<br/>the restoration of trust that must occur before complete reciprocation can be expected.<br/>Conclusion<br/>Today, 20 years have passed since the fall of the Berlin Wall – it’s <br/>AND<br/>Cuba.

This legacy dates from the Monroe Doctrine, articulated in 1823, through the Rio pact, the postwar treaty that pledged the United States to come to the defense of its allies in Central and South America.<br/>Yet for a half-century, our policies toward our southern neighbors have alternated between intervention and neglect, inappropriate meddling and missed opportunities. The death this week of President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela — who along with Fidel Castro of Cuba was perhaps the most vociferous critic of the United States among the political leaders of the Western Hemisphere in recent decades — offers an opportunity to restore bonds with potential allies who share the American goal of prosperity.<br/>Throughout his career, the autocratic Mr. Chávez used our embargo as a wedge with which to antagonize the United States and alienate its supporters. His fuel helped prop up the rule of Mr. Castro and his brother Raúl, Cuba’s current president. The embargo no longer serves any useful purpose (if it ever did at all); President Obama should end it, though it would mean overcoming powerful opposition from Cuban-American lawmakers in Congress.<br/>An end to the Cuba embargo would send a powerful signal to all of Latin America that the United States wants a new, warmer relationship with democratic forces seeking social change throughout the Americas.<br/>I joined the State Department as a Foreign Service officer in the 1950s and chose <br/>AND<br/>region since the end of Spanish and Portuguese rule in the 19th century.<br/>Kennedy had a charisma of his own, and it captured the imaginations of leaders <br/>AND<br/>D. Roosevelt and transformed the whole concept of inter-American relations.<br/>Tragically, after Kennedy’s assassination in 1963, the ideal of the Alliance for Progress crumbled and “la noche mas larga” — “the longest night” — began for the proponents of Latin American democracy. Military regimes flourished, democratic governments withered, moderate political and civil leaders were labeled Communists, rights of free speech and assembly were curtailed and human dignity crushed, largely because the United States abandoned all standards save that of anti-Communism.<br/>During my Foreign Service career, I did what I could to oppose policies that supported dictators and closed off democratic alternatives. In 1981, as the ambassador to El Salvador, I refused a demand by the secretary of state, Alexander M. Haig Jr., that I use official channels to cover up the Salvadoran military’s responsibility for the murders of four American churchwomen. I was fired and forced out of the Foreign Service.<br/>The Reagan administration, under the illusion that Cuba was the power driving the Salvadoran revolution, turned its policy over to the Pentagon and C.I.A., with predictable results. During the 1980s the United States helped expand the Salvadoran military, which was dominated by uniformed assassins. We armed them, trained them and covered up their crimes.<br/>After our counterrevolutionary efforts failed to end the Salvadoran conflict, the Defense Department asked <br/>AND<br/>and at a cost disproportionate to any conventional conception of the national interest.”<br/>Over the subsequent quarter-century, a series of profound political, social and <br/>AND<br/>States — which excludes the United States and Canada — as an alternative.<br/>At a regional meeting that included Cuba and excluded the United States, Mr. Chávez said that “the most positive thing for the independence of our continent is that we meet alone without the hegemony of empire.”<br/>Mr. Chávez was masterful at manipulating America’s antagonism toward Fidel Castro as a rhetorical stick with which to attack the United States as an imperialist aggressor, an enemy of progressive change, interested mainly in treating Latin America as a vassal continent, a source of cheap commodities and labor.<br/>Like its predecessors, the Obama administration has given few signs that it has grasped the magnitude of these changes or cares about their consequences. After President Obama took office in 2009, Latin America’s leading statesman at the time, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, then the president of Brazil, urged Mr. Obama to normalize relations with Cuba.<br/>Lula, as he is universally known, correctly identified our Cuba policy as the chief stumbling block to renewed ties with Latin America, as it had been since the very early years of the Castro regime.<br/>After the failure of the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion, Washington set out to accomplish by stealth and economic strangulation what it had failed to do by frontal attack. But the clumsy mix of covert action and porous boycott succeeded primarily in bringing shame on the United States and turning Mr. Castro into a folk hero.<br/>And even now, despite the relaxing of travel restrictions and Raúl Castro’s announcement that <br/>AND<br/>Committee, but his power has been weakened by a continuing ethics controversy.)<br/>Are there any other examples in the history of diplomacy where the leaders of a small, weak nation can prevent a great power from acting in its own best interest merely by staying alive?<br/>The re-election of President Obama, and the death of Mr. Chávez<br/>AND<br/>president is prepared to show some flexibility on Cuba and asks your help.<br/>Such a simple request could transform the Cuban issue from a bilateral problem into a multilateral challenge. It would then be up to Latin Americans to devise a policy that would help Cuba achieve a sufficient measure of democratic change to justify its reintegration into a hemisphere composed entirely of elected governments.<br/>If, however, our present policy paralysis continues, we will soon see the emergence of two rival camps, the United States versus Latin America. While Washington would continue to enjoy friendly relations with individual countries like Brazil, Mexico and Colombia, the vision of Roosevelt and Kennedy of a hemisphere of partners cooperating in matters of common concern would be reduced to a historical footnote.</p><p>Increased regional standing bolsters influence in international institutions allowing the US to lead multilateral forums<br/>Sabatini and Berger 12 – Christopher Sabatini is editor-in-chief of Americas Quarterly and senior director of policy at Americas Society/Council of the Americas.
