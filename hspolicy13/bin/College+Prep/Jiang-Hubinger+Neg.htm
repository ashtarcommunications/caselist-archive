It is made by a member's obtaining the floor as already described and saying, "I move that" (which is equivalent to saying, "I propose that"), and then stating the action he proposes to have taken. Thus a member "moves" (proposes) that a resolution be adopted, or amended, or referred to a committee, or that a vote of thanks be extended, etc.; or "That it is the sense of this meeting (or assembly) that industrial training," etc. Every resolution should be in writing, and the presiding officer has a right to require any main motion, amendment, or instructions to a committee to be in writing. When a main motion is of such importance or length as to be in writing it is usually written in the form of a resolution; that is, beginning with the words, "Resolved, That," the word "Resolved " being underscored (printed in italics) and followed by a comma, and the word "That" beginning with a capital "T." If the word "Resolved" were replaced by the words "I move," the resolution would become a motion. A resolution is always a main motion. In some sections of the country the word "resolve" is frequently used instead of "resolution." In assemblies with paid employees, instructions given to employees are called "orders" instead of "resolutions," and the enacting word, "Ordered" is used instead of "Resolved." continues After a question has been stated by the chair, it is before the assembly for consideration and action. All resolutions, reports of committees, communications to the assembly, and all amendments proposed to them, and all other motions except the Undebatable Motions mentioned in 45, may be debated before final action is taken on them, unless by a two-thirds vote the assembly decides to dispose of them without debate. By a two-thirds vote is meant two-thirds of the votes cast, a quorum being present. In the debate each member has the right to speak twice on the same question on the same day (except on an appeal), but cannot make a second speech on the same question as long as any member who has not spoken on that question desires the floor. No one can speak longer than ten minutes at a time without permission of the assembly. Debate must be limited to the merits of the immediately pending question — that is, the last question stated by the chair that is still pending; except that in a few cases the main question is also open to debate 45. Speakers must address their remarks to the presiding officer, be courteous in their language and deportment, and avoid all personalities, never alluding to the officers or other members by name, where possible to avoid it, nor to the motives of members.&nbsp;</p><p>“Should” is obligatory <br/>Judge Henry Nieto 9, Colorado Court of Appeals, 8-20-2009 People v. Munoz, 240 P.3d 311 (Colo. Ct. App. 2009)</p><p>"Should" is "used . . . to express duty, obligation, propriety, or expediency." Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2104 (2002). Courts &nbsp;<strong>15 interpreting the word in various contexts have drawn conflicting conclusions, although the weight of authority appears to favor interpreting "should" in an imperative, obligatory sense. HN7A number of courts, confronted with the question of whether using the word "should" in jury instructions conforms with the Fifth and Sixth Amendment protections governing the reasonable doubt standard, have upheld instructions using the word. In the courts of other states in which a defendant has argued that the word "should" in the reasonable doubt instruction does not sufficiently inform the jury that it is bound to find the defendant not guilty if insufficient proof is submitted at trial, the courts have squarely rejected the argument. They reasoned that the word "conveys a sense of duty and obligation and could not be misunderstood by a jury." See State v. McCloud, 257 Kan. 1, 891 P.2d 324, 335 (Kan. 1995); see also Tyson v. State, 217 Ga. App. 428, 457 S.E.2d 690, 691-92 (Ga. Ct. App. 1995) (finding argument that "should" is directional but not instructional to be without merit); Commonwealth v. Hammond, 350 Pa. Super. 477, 504 A.2d 940, 941-42 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1986). &nbsp;Notably, courts interpreting the word "should" in other types of jury instructions&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>16 have also found that the word conveys to the jury a sense of duty or obligation and not discretion. In Little v. State, 261 Ark. 859, 554 S.W.2d 312, 324 (Ark. 1977), the Arkansas Supreme Court interpreted the word "should" in an instruction on circumstantial evidence as synonymous with the word "must" and rejected the defendant's argument that the jury may have been misled by the court's use of the word in the instruction. Similarly, the Missouri Supreme Court rejected a defendant's argument that the court erred by not using the word "should" in an instruction on witness credibility which used the word "must" because the two words have the same meaning. State v. Rack, 318 S.W.2d 211, 215 (Mo. 1958). &nbsp;&nbsp;*318 &nbsp;In applying a child support statute, the Arizona Court of Appeals concluded that a legislature's or commission's use of the word "should" is meant to convey duty or obligation. McNutt v. McNutt, 203 Ariz. 28, 49 P.3d 300, 306 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2002) (finding a statute stating that child support expenditures "should" be allocated for the purpose of parents' federal tax exemption to be mandatory).</p><p>Substantial means full effect---must be tangible increase in restrictions<br/>Words and Phrases 64 (40 WandP 759)</p><p>The words "outward, open, actual, risible, substantial, and exclusive," in connection with a change of possession, mean substantially the same thing.

However, the term "increase" connotes change. To show change, appellees would have been required to present evidence of the condition of the building at the time the policy was issued. See 5 J. Appleman and J. Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice, § 2941 at 4-5 (1970). Because no such evidence was presented, this court cannot determine, on this record, whether the risk has, in fact, been increased. Indeed, the answer to this question may depend on Mr. Glassley's knowledge of the condition of the building at the time the policy was issued, see 17 J. Appleman and J. Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice, § 9602 at 515-16 (1981), since the fundamental issue is whether the appellees contemplated insuring the risk which incurred the loss.</p><p>Economic Engagement must create structural linkages.<br/>Pollins 3 (Brian M., Associate Professor of Political Science at Ohio State University and a Research Fellow at the Mershon Center, Edward Deering Mansfield, Hum Rosen Professor of Political Science and Co-Director of the Christopher H.

He viewed economic engagement as a long-term, transformative strategy. As one state gradually expands economic interaction with its target, the resulting (asymmetrical) interdependence creates vested interests within the target society and government. The beneficiaries of interdependence become addicted to it, and they protect their interests by pressuring the government to accommodate the source of interdependence. Economic engagement is a form of structural linkage; it is a means to get other states to want what you want, rather than to do what you want. The causal chain runs from economic interdependence through domestic political change to foreign policy accommodation.</p><p>B. Violation – the 1AC fails to advance a topical discussion substantially increasing economic engagement. &nbsp;The affirmative instead looks to engage in the negative space of the topic to discuss the the ills of neoliberalism and imperialism which are distinct economic engagement. &nbsp;They claim to win the debate for reasons other than the desirability of topical action. &nbsp;That undermines preparation and clash.

Americans continue to agree. A 1997 survey by the National Constitution Center (NCC) found that 84 percent of Americans believed that for the government to work as intended, citizens needed to be informed and active. Three-quarters of those polled claimed that the Constitution mattered in their daily lives, and almost as many people thought the Constitution impacted events in America today. Yet, despite this nod to civic literacy, too few Americans could answer the questions on the citizenship test or similar questions. Forty-one percent of respondents to the NCC national survey were not aware that there were three branches of government, and 62 percent couldn’t name them; 33 percent couldn’t even name one. Over half of all those answering the NCC survey did not know the length of a term for a member of the Senate or House of Representatives. And another NCC study found that while 71 percent of teens knew that “www” starts an online web address, only 35 percent knew that “We the People” are the opening words of the Constitution. A study by the Intercollegiate Studies Institute found that “the average college senior knows astoundingly little about America’s history, government, international relations and market economy, earning an ‘F’ on the American civic literacy exam with a score of 54.2 percent.”<br/>Second, focus on narrow critical arguments trades off with and destroys civic education<br/>Lane. 8<br/>Eric Lane Issue #10, Fall 2008 America 101 How we let civic education slide—and why we need a crash course in the Constitution today. <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.democracyjournal.org/10/6643.php?page=all  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.democracyjournal.org/10/6643.php?page=all%27" tppabs="http://www.democracyjournal.org/10/6643.php?page=all"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.democracyjournal.org/10/6643.php?page=all</span></a></span></p><p>The drop-off in civic literacy has also helped fuel the erosion of the national political consensus that drove the soaring successes of post-war America. During that period the federal government grew from a distant star in a far-off galaxy to the daily light of our political life. As Richard Nixon noted in his 1970 State of the Union address, “Ours has become–as it continues to be, and should remain a society of large expectations. Government helped to generate these expectations. It undertook to meet them.” It undertook to meet them through responding to the consensus demands for a number of economic, civil, and environmental rights established through, for example, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act, and a broad expansion of environmental protections. But by 1970, this grand consensus was only a memory. Its dissolution came about for many reasons, but it is no accident that it coincided with the decline in civic education and civic literacy. In fact, the two have driven each other–political dissolution made it harder to speak about American civics, but the lack of such discussion guaranteed that Americans, particularly students, would enter the world with a dimmer conception of American life and a shakier commitment to a community beyond their narrow self-interests. In this disharmony, the spirit of “we” was replaced by a culture of “me” (or, sometimes, “us,” as groups vied for advantage). We were (and are) living through “the growth of a politics based upon narrow concerns, rooted in the exploitative divisions of class, cash, gender, region, ethnicity, morality and ideology–a give no quarter and take no prisoners activism that demands satisfaction and accepts no compromise,” as David Frohnmayer, the President of the University of Oregon, put it. The result is a culture and government that can make only halting progress. Lacking a deep sense of civic life, we demand things for ourselves and our group without an appreciation of the give-and-take inherent in American politics. The expectation the Framers had of “mutual concessions and sacrifices…mutual forbearance and conciliation” became replaced by a civically illiterate nation, unappreciative and unforgiving of a government that was not fulfilling their demands. <br/>Third, discussion and research of specific policy-questions is crucial for skills development—refusal to engage in institutional reform reduces inquiry to narcissism. There is a direct tradeoff with productive discussion and research.<br/>Chandler 9 David, Professor of International Relations at the University of Westminster, “Questioning Global Political Activism,” What is Radical Politics Today? October 2009, pgs. 81-82</p><p>Today more and more people are ‘doing politics ’ in their academic work. This is the reason for the boom in International Relations study and the attraction of other social sciences to the global sphere. I would argue that the attraction of IR for many people has not been IR theory but the desire to practice global ethics. The boom in the IR discipline has coincided with a rejection of Realist theoretical frameworks of power and interests and the sovereignty/anarchy problematic. However, I would argue that this rejection has not been a product of theoretical engagement with Realism but an ethical act of rejection of Realism’s ontological focus. It seems that our ideas and our theories say much more about us than the world we live in. Normative theorists and Constructivists tend to support the global ethical turn arguing that we should not be as concerned with ‘what is’ as with the potential for the emergence of global ethical community. Constructivists, in particular, focus upon the ethical language which political elites espouse rather than the practices of power. But the most dangerous trends in the discipline today are those frameworks which have taken up Critical theory and argue that focusing on the world as it exists is conservative ‘problem -solving’ while the task for critical theorists is to focus on emancipatory alternative form s of living or of thinking about the world. Critical thought then becomes a process of wishful thinking rather than one of engagement, 6 with its advocates arguing that we need to focus on clarifying our own ethical frameworks and biases and positionality before thinking about or teaching on world affairs; in the process this becomes ‘m e-search’ rather than research. We have moved a long way from Hedley Bull’s perspective that, for academic research to be truly radical, we had to put our values to the side to follow where the question or inquiry might lead. The inward-looking and narcissistic trends in academia, where we are m o re concerned with our ‘reflectivity ’ – the awareness of our own ethics and values - than with engaging with the world, was brought home to me when I asked my IR students which theoretical frameworks they agreed with most and they replied mostly Critical theory and Constructivism despite the fact that they thought that states operated on the basis of power and self -interest in a world of anarchy. Their theoretical preferences were based more on what their choices said about them as ethical individuals than about how theory might be used to understand and engage with the world. Conclusion I have attempted to argue that there is a lot at stake in the new politics of global ethics. Politics has become a religious activity, an activity which is no longer socially mediated; it is less and less an activity based on social engagement and the testing of ideas in public debate or in the academy. Doing politics today, whether in radical activism , government policy - m a king, or in academia, seems to bring people into a one-to-one relationship with global issues in the same way religious people have a one-to-one relationship with their God. Politics is increasingly like religion because when we look for meaning we find it inside ourselves rather than in the external consequences of our ‘political ’ acts. W h at matters is the conviction or the act in itself: its connection to the global sphere is one that we increasingly tend to provide idealistically. Another way of expressing this limited sense of our subjectivity is in the popularity of globalisation theory – the idea that instrumentality is n o longer possible today because the world is such a complex and interconnected place and therefore there is no way of knowing the consequences of our actions. The more we engage in the new politics where there is an unmediated 7 relationship between us as individuals and global issues, the less we engage instrumentally with the outside world and the less we engage with our peers and colleagues at the level of political or intellectual debate and organization.<br/>Fourth, a limited topic of discussion that provides for equitable ground is key to productive inculcation of decision-making and advocacy skills in all facets of life---even if their position is contestable that’s distinct from it being valuably debatable---this still provides room for flexibility, creativity, and innovation, but targets the discussion to avoid mere statements of fact.<br/>Steinberg and Freeley 8 *Austin J. Freeley is a Boston based attorney who focuses on criminal, personal injury and civil rights law, AND <strong>David L. Steinberg , Lecturer of Communication Studies @ U Miami, Argumentation and Debate: Critical Thinking for Reasoned Decision Making pp45</strong></p><p>Debate is a means of settling differences, so there must be a difference of opinion or a conflict of interest before there can be a debate. If everyone is in agreement on a tact or value or policy, there is no need for debate: the matter can be settled by unanimous consent. Thus, for example, it would be pointless to attempt to debate "Resolved: That two plus two equals four," because there is simply no controversy about this statement. (Controversy is an essential prerequisite of debate. Where there is no clash of ideas, proposals, interests, or expressed positions on issues, there is no debate. In addition, debate cannot produce effective decisions without clear identification of a question or questions to be answered. For example, general argument may occur about the broad topic of illegal immigration. How many illegal immigrants are in the United States? What is the impact of illegal immigration and immigrants on our economy? What is their impact on our communities? Do they commit crimes? Do they take jobs from American workers? Do they pay taxes? Do they require social services? Is it a problem that some do not speak English? Is it the responsibility of employers to discourage illegal immigration by not hiring undocumented workers? Should they have the opportunity- to gain citizenship? Docs illegal immigration pose a security threat to our country? Do illegal immigrants do work that American workers are unwilling to do? Are their rights as workers and as human beings at risk due to their status? Are they abused by employers, law enforcement, housing, and businesses? I low are their families impacted by their status? What is the moral and philosophical obligation of a nation state to maintain its borders? Should we build a wall on the Mexican border, establish a national identification can!, or enforce existing laws against employers? Should we invite immigrants to become U.S. citizens? Surely you can think of many more concerns to be addressed by a conversation about the topic area of illegal immigration. Participation in this "debate" is likely to be emotional and intense. However, it is not likely to be productive or useful without focus on a particular question and identification of a line demarcating sides in the controversy. To be discussed and resolved effectively, controversies must be stated clearly. Vague understanding results in unfocused deliberation and poor decisions, frustration, and emotional distress, as evidenced by the failure of the United States Congress to make progress on the immigration debate during the summer of 2007.¶ Someone disturbed by the problem of the growing underclass of poorly educated, socially disenfranchised youths might observe, "Public schools are doing a terrible job! They are overcrowded, and many teachers are poorly qualified in their subject areas. Even the best teachers can do little more than struggle to maintain order in their classrooms." That same concerned citizen, facing a complex range of issues, might arrive at an unhelpful decision, such as "We ought to do something about this" or. worse. "It's too complicated a problem to deal with." Groups of concerned citizens worried about the state of public education could join together to express their frustrations, anger, disillusionment, and emotions regarding the schools, but without a focus for their discussions, they could easily agree about the sorry state of education without finding points of clarity or potential solutions. A gripe session would follow. But if a precise question is posed—such as "What can be done to improve public education?"—then a more profitable area of discussion is opened up simply by placing a focus on the search for a concrete solution step. One or more judgments can be phrased in the form of debate propositions, motions for parliamentary debate, or bills for legislative assemblies. The statements "Resolved: That the federal government should implement a program of charter schools in at-risk communities" and "Resolved: That the state of Florida should adopt a school voucher program" more clearly identify specific ways of dealing with educational problems in a manageable form, suitable for debate. They provide specific policies to be investigated and aid discussants in identifying points of difference.¶ To have a productive debate, which facilitates effective decision making by directing and placing limits on the decision to be made, the basis for argument should be clearly defined. If we merely talk about "homelessness" or "abortion" or "crime'* or "global warming" we are likely to have an interesting discussion but not to establish profitable basis for argument. For example, the statement "Resolved: That the pen is mightier than the sword" is debatable, yet fails to provide much basis for clear argumentation. If we take this statement to mean that the written word is more effective than physical force for some purposes, we can identify a problem area: the comparative effectiveness of writing or physical force for a specific purpose.¶ Although we now have a general subject, we have not yet stated a problem. It is still too broad, too loosely worded to promote well-organized argument. What sort of writing are we concerned with—poems, novels, government documents, website development, advertising, or what? What does "effectiveness" mean in this context? What kind of physical force is being compared—fists, dueling swords, bazookas, nuclear weapons, or what? A more specific question might be. "Would a mutual defense treaty or a visit by our fleet be more effective in assuring Liurania of our support in a certain crisis?" The basis for argument could be phrased in a debate proposition such as "Resolved: That the United States should enter into a mutual defense treatv with Laurania." Negative advocates might oppose this proposition by arguing that fleet maneuvers would be a better solution. This is not to say that debates should completely avoid creative interpretation of the controversy by advocates, or that good debates cannot occur over competing interpretations of the controversy; in fact, these sorts of debates may be very engaging. The point is that debate is best facilitated by the guidance provided by focus on a particular point of difference, which will be outlined in the following discussion.<br/>Effective decision-making outweighs—<br/>a. Effective deliberation is the lynchpin of solving all existential global problems<br/>Christian O. Lundberg 10 Professor of Communications @ University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, “Tradition of Debate in North Carolina” in Navigating Opportunity: Policy Debate in the 21st Century By Allan D. Louden, p311</p><p>The second major problem with the critique that identifies a naivety in articulating debate and democracy is that it presumes that the primary pedagogical outcome of debate is speech capacities. But the democratic capacities built by debate are not limited to speech—as indicated earlier, debate builds capacity for critical thinking, analysis of public claims, informed decision making, and better public judgment. If the picture of modem political life that underwrites this critique of debate is a pessimistic view of increasingly labyrinthine and bureaucratic administrative politics, rapid scientific and technological change outpacing the capacities of the citizenry to comprehend them, and ever-expanding insular special-interest- and money-driven politics, it is a puzzling solution, at best, to argue that these conditions warrant giving up on debate. If democracy is open to rearticulation, it is open to rearticulation precisely because as the challenges of modern political life proliferate, the citizenry's capacities can change, which is one of the primary reasons that theorists of democracy such as Ocwey in The Public awl Its Problems place such a high premium on education (Dewey 1988,63, 154). Debate provides an indispensible form of education in the modem articulation of democracy because it builds precisely the skills that allow the citizenry to research and be informed about policy decisions that impact them, to son rhroueh and evaluate the evidence for and relative merits of arguments for and against a policy in an increasingly infonnation-rich environment, and to prioritize their time and political energies toward policies that matter the most to them.¶ The merits of debate as a tool for building democratic capacity-building take on a special significance in the context of information literacy. John Larkin (2005, HO) argues that one of the primary failings of modern colleges and universities is that they have not changed curriculum to match with the challenges of a new information environment. This is a problem for the course of academic study in our current context, but perhaps more important, argues Larkin, for the future of a citizenry that will need to make evaluative choices against an increasingly complex and multimediatcd information environment (ibid-). Larkin's study tested the benefits of debate participation on information-literacy skills and concluded that in-class debate participants reported significantly higher self-efficacy ratings of their ability to navigate academic search databases and to effectively search and use other Web resources:¶ To analyze the self-report ratings of the instructional and control group students, we first conducted a multivariate analysis of variance on all of the ratings, looking jointly at the effect of instmction/no instruction and debate topic . . . that it did not matter which topic students had been assigned . . . students in the Instnictional debate) group were significantly more confident in their ability to access information and less likely to feel that they needed help to do so----These findings clearly indicate greater self-efficacy for online searching among students who participated in (debate).... These results constitute strong support for the effectiveness of the project on students' self-efficacy for online searching in the academic databases. There was an unintended effect, however: After doing ... the project, instructional group students also felt more confident than the other students in their ability to get good information from Yahoo and Google. It may be that the library research experience increased self-efficacy for any searching, not just in academic databases. (Larkin 2005, 144)¶ Larkin's study substantiates Thomas Worthcn and Gaylcn Pack's (1992, 3) claim that debate in the college classroom plays a critical role in fostering the kind of problem-solving skills demanded by the increasingly rich media and information environment of modernity. Though their essay was written in 1992 on the cusp of the eventual explosion of the Internet as a medium, Worthcn and Pack's framing of the issue was prescient: the primary question facing today's student has changed from how to best research a topic to the crucial question of learning how to best evaluate which arguments to cite and rely upon from an easily accessible and veritable cornucopia of materials.¶ There are, without a doubt, a number of important criticisms of employing debate as a model for democratic deliberation. But cumulatively, the evidence presented here warrants strong support for expanding debate practice in the classroom as a technology for enhancing democratic deliberative capacities. The unique combination of critical thinking skills, research and information processing skills, oral communication skills, and capacities for listening and thoughtful, open engagement with hotly contested issues argues for debate as a crucial component of a rich and vital democratic life. In-class debate practice both aids students in achieving the best goals of college and university education, and serves as an unmatched practice for creating thoughtful, engaged, open-minded and self-critical students who are open to the possibilities of meaningful political engagement and new articulations of democratic life.¶ Expanding this practice is crucial, if only because the more we produce citizens that can actively and effectively engage the political process, the more likely we are to produce revisions of democratic life that are necessary if democracy is not only to survive, but to thrive. Democracy faces a myriad of challenges, including: domestic and international issues of class, gender, and racial justice; wholesale environmental destruction and the potential for rapid climate change; emerging threats to international stability in the form of terrorism, intervention and new possibilities for great power conflict; and increasing challenges of rapid globalization including an increasingly volatile global economic structure. More than any specific policy or proposal, an informed and active citizenry that deliberates with greater skill and sensitivity provides one of the best hopes for responsive and effective democratic governance, and by extension, one of the last best hopes for dealing with the existential challenges to democracy in an increasingly complex world. <br/>b.

After 9/11, Americans became appropriately worried about more attacks, and in turn they have, as they did in the past, looked to the President for protection. And President George W. Bush, as have earlier Presidents, responded. But his response has been based on a unique claim of unprecedented constitutional powers to engage our troops, wiretap our citizens, and torture our prisoners. “Monarchial prerogatives,” the Administration has labeled them. While the excessiveness of this view has roiled some of the Administration’s own loyalists, there has been no retreat from its assertion. There has been no need to. Congress has not asserted itself against this claim, in part because they would not take such a confrontational step without broad public support. And Americans have not been forceful in demanding that Congress protect our constitutional system. While there are various reasons for the public’s acquiescence, it is hard to posit that civic ignorance doesn’t rank high among them.<br/>Debate is key to social improvements in all facets of life<br/>Steinberg and Freeley 8 *Austin J. Freeley is a Boston based attorney who focuses on criminal, personal injury and civil rights law, AND <strong>David L. Steinberg , Lecturer of Communication Studies @ U Miami, Argumentation and Debate: Critical Thinking for Reasoned Decision Making pp9-10</strong></p><p>If we assume it to be possible without recourse to violence to reach agreement on all the problems implied in the employment of the idea of justice we are granting the possibility of formulating an ideal of man and society, valid for all beings endowed with reason and accepted by what we have called elsewhere the universal audience.14¶ I think that the only discursive methods available to us stem from techniques that are not demonstrative—that is, conclusive and rational in the narrow sense of the term—but from argumentative techniques which are not conclusive but which may tend to demonstrate the reasonable character of the conceptions put forward. It is this recourse to the rational and reasonable for the realization of the ideal of universal communion that characterizes the age-long endeavor of all philosophies in their aspiration for a city of man in which violence may progressively give way to wisdom.13¶ Whenever an individual controls the dimensions of" a problem, he or she can solve the problem through a personal decision. For example, if the problem is whether to go to the basketball game tonight, if tickets are not too expensive and if transportation is available, the decision can be made individually. But if a friend's car is needed to get to the game, then that person's decision to furnish the transportation must be obtained.¶ Complex problems, too, are subject to individual decision making. American business offers many examples of small companies that grew into major corporations while still under the individual control of the founder. Some computer companies that began in the 1970s as one-person operations burgeoned into multimillion-dollar corporations with the original inventor still making all the major decisions. And some of the multibillion-dollar leveraged buyouts of the 1980s were put together by daring—some would say greedy—financiers who made the day-to-day and even hour-to-hour decisions individually.¶ When President George H. W. Bush launched Operation Desert Storm, when President Bill Clinton sent troops into Somalia and Haiti and authorized Operation Desert Fox, and when President George W. Bush authorized Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and Operation Iraqi Freedom in Iraq, they each used different methods of decision making, but in each case the ultimate decision was an individual one. In fact, many government decisions can be made only by the president. As Walter Lippmann pointed out, debate is the only satisfactory way the exact issues can be decided:¶ A president, whoever he is, has to find a way of understanding the novel and changing issues which he must, under the Constitution, decide. Broadly speaking ... the president has two ways of making up his mind. The one is to turn to his subordinates—to his chiefs of staff and his cabinet officers and undersecretaries and the like—and to direct them to argue out the issues and to bring him an agreed decision…¶ The other way is to sit like a judge at a hearing where the issues to be decided are debated. After he has heard the debate, after he has examined the evidence, after he has heard the debaters cross-examine one another, after he has questioned them himself he makes his decision…¶ It is a much harder method in that it subjects the president to the stress of feeling the full impact of conflicting views, and then to the strain of making his decision, fully aware of how momentous it Is. But there is no other satisfactory way by which momentous and complex issues can be decided.16¶ John F. Kennedy used Cabinet sessions and National Security Council meetings to provide debate to illuminate diverse points of view, expose errors, and challenge assumptions before he reached decisions.17 As he gained experience in office, he placed greater emphasis on debate. One historian points out: "One reason for the difference between the Bay of Pigs and the missile crisis was that the Bay of Pig* fiasco instructed Kennedy in the importance of uninhibited debate in advance of major decision."18 All presidents, to varying degrees, encourage debate among their advisors.¶ We may never be called on to render the final decision on great issues of national policy, but we are constantly concerned with decisions important to ourselves for which debate can be applied in similar ways. That is, this debate may take place in our minds as we weigh the pros and cons of the problem, or we may arrange for others to debate the problem for us. Because we all are increasingly involved in the decisions of the campus, community, and society in general, it is in our intelligent self-interest to reach these decisions through reasoned debate.</p></div></div></td><td>4/26/14</td></tr><tr><td style="width:100%; word-break:break-all; word-break:break-word;"><div><p><input onclick="saveEntry(9)" src="../../xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" tppabs="http://hspolicy13.debatecoaches.org/xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" style="float:right;" title="Save" type="image" value="Save"></input>

How has it become possible to take one event, that of 9/11, and translate it into a global network of terrorism that seemingly knows no bounds? How has it become possible to trace the movements of terrorism and terrorist cells even across national boundaries? How, in other words, has it now become possible to name the terrorist?<br/>Foucault argues that there is a decisive shift in the penal system’s approach to criminality, and that this shift is a result of the change in focus from the body of the criminal to the soul of the criminal. &nbsp;In short, because discipline is concerned with the rehabilitation of the criminal, it is not so much the crime itself that becomes the object of focus but the extenuating circumstances, the history behind the crime that are the source of disciplinary power5. &nbsp;Our ability as experts on criminal behavior to categorize, to provide the historical context for the terrorist act becomes the means through which we can incorporate the terrorist as delinquent into the disciplinary power framework. &nbsp;Take this example from one of George W. Bush’s addresses:<br/>This group and its leader -- a person named Osama bin Laden -- are linked to many other organizations in different countries, including the Egyptian Islamic Jihad and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan. &nbsp;There are thousands of these terrorists in more than 60 countries. &nbsp;They are recruited from their own nations and neighborhoods and brought to camps in places like Afghanistan, where they are trained in the tactics of terror. &nbsp;They are sent back to their homes or sent to hide in countries around the world to plot evil and destruction.<br/>We find that the terrorist today is more obedient than ever. &nbsp;Indeed, our not-so-concealed delight in discovering the vast disciplinary mechanisms of the terrorist cell means that we truly have a subject worth studying. &nbsp;The sheer audacity of the disciplined terrorist thrills us to no end; it has every “expert” babbling incessantly because we can see the disciplinary power framework at work even in the delinquent behavior of the terrorist. &nbsp;Take for instance, these excerpts from others of George W. Bush’s addresses in which the visibility of the terrorist cell leads to the possibility of its incorporation into a disciplined society:<br/>Americans should not expect one battle, but a lengthy campaign, unlike any other we have ever seen. &nbsp;It may include dramatic strikes, visible on TV, and covert operations, secret even in success. Our discoveries in Afghanistan confirmed our worst fears, and showed us the true scope of the task ahead. &nbsp;We have seen the depth of our enemies' hatred in videos, where they laugh about the loss of innocent life. &nbsp;And the depth of their hatred is equaled by the madness of the destruction they design. &nbsp;We have found diagrams of American nuclear power plants and public water facilities, detailed instructions for making chemical weapons, surveillance maps of American cities, and thorough descriptions of landmarks in America and throughout the world.<br/>Because it is now possible to link the individual terrorist to an entire terrorist network, rehabilitation is no longer just about the amelioration of the individual terrorist but of the entire nation which harbors these terrorists. &nbsp;If we can speak of a certain transnational terrorism today, it is because the disciplinary apparatus has allowed our knowledge of this delinquent to extend across national boundaries. &nbsp;It is no longer inconceivable, then, to incarcerate an entire nation for the sake of eradicating terrorism. &nbsp;Indeed, it can be argued that this incarceration, this disciplining occupation, this reforming presence of the “expert” on democracy is in fact necessary for this nation to emerge as a nation.<br/>By making the terrorist act and the terrorist himself visible, the United States emerges as a subject, who ironically, is cast as refusing to be subjected to the fear-driven power of the terrorists. &nbsp;In seeing the terrorist everywhere, whether in the domestic or international arena, the United States also becomes a transnational subject, able to extend across national borders in order to rehabilitate the terror-filled nations of the world. &nbsp;What is hauntingly brilliant about discipline is this very fact: that the visibility of the criminal provides the perfect cover for an otherwise brutal and exacting science of power, that if not for this “mask,” would indeed be indistinguishable from the figure of the king. <br/>The power to see the criminal everywhere, in everyone, the secret knowledge that every individual could be a terrorist, is what allows every individual to be subjected to that power. &nbsp;The terrorist can be rooted out, while the disciplinary mechanism that allows both the terrorist and the terrorized to emerge remains hidden beneath an impenetrable series of never-ending disciplinary machinations. &nbsp;If we cannot find Osama bin Laden today, we cannot also find George W. Bush. &nbsp;Both of these figures are subject to the same mechanism, such that sometimes, they even become indistinguishable from one another. &nbsp;Who is the terrorist and who is the terrorized? The true terror is that this question is irrelevant to the functioning of the disciplinary technology of power. &nbsp;The discourse on terrorism is indeed, then, “...a genealogy of the present scientifico-legal complex from which the power to punish derives its bases, justifications and rules, from which it extends its effects and by which it masks its exorbitant singularity” (Foucault 23).?<br/>Silence on state terror reifies these state-centric problem-solving paradigms and functions to maintain the legitimacy of state violence. This definitional control over legitimate forms of violence is the condition of possibility for state terrorism to occur.<br/>Jackson 9<br/>(Richard Jackson is Reader in the Department of International Politics, Aberystwyth University, and a Senior Researcher at the Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Contemporary Political Violence (CSRV). He is the founding editor of the journal, Critical Studies on Terrorism, Critical Studies on Terrorism, Volume 1 Issue 3, “The ghosts of state terror: knowledge, politics and terrorism studies”, p 385-356)</p><p>In contrast to first-order critique, second-order critique involves the adoption of a critical standpoint outside of the discourse. In this case, based on an understanding of discourse as socially productive or constitutive, and fully cognisant of the knowledge–power nexus, a second-order critique attempts to expose the political functions and ideological consequences of the particular forms of representation enunciated by the discourse. In this case, we want to try and understand what some of the political effects and consequences of the silences of state terrorism are. A number of such effects can be identified. First, the discourse naturalises a particular understanding of what terrorism is, namely, a form of illegitimate non-state violence. Such an understanding of terrorism functions to restrict the scholarly viewpoint to one set of actors and to particular kinds of actions, and functions to distract and obscure other actors and actions which should be named and studied as ‘terrorism’. It also narrows the possibilities for understanding terrorism within alternative paradigms, such as from the perspective of gender terrorism (Sharlach 2008). In other words, it has a restrictive and distorting effect within the field of knowledge which gives the impression that terrorism studies is more of a narrow extension of counter-insurgency or national security studies than an open and inclusive domain of research into all forms and aspects of terrorism. Consequently, Silke (2001) concludes that terrorism studies ‘is largely driven by policy concerns’ and ‘largely limited to government agendas’ (p. 2). In addition, the broader academic, social, and cultural influence of terrorism studies (through the authority and legitimacy provided by ‘terrorism experts’ to the media and as policy advisers, for example), means that this restrictive viewpoint is diffused to the broader society, which in turn generates its own ideological effects. Specifically, the distorted focus on non-state terrorism functions to reify state perspectives and priorities, and reinforce a state-centric, problem-solving paradigm of politics in which ‘terrorism’ is viewed as an identifiable social or individual problem in need of solving by the state, and not as a practice of state power, for example. From this perspective, it functions to maintain the legitimacy of state uses of violence and delegitimise all forms of non-state violence (which has its own ideological effects and is problematic in a number of obvious ways). This fundamental belief in the instrumental rationality of political violence as an effective and legitimate tool of the state is open to a great many criticisms, not least that it provides the normative basis from which non-state terrorist groups frequently justify their own (often well-intentioned) violence (Oliverio and Lauderdale 2005, Burke 2008). There is from this viewpoint an ethical imperative to try and undermine the widespread acceptance that political violence is a mostly legitimate and effective option in resolving conflict – for either state or non-state actors. Political violence is in fact, a moral and physical disaster in the vast majority of cases. From an ethical-normative perspective, such a restricted understanding of terrorism also functions to obscure and silence the voices and perspectives of those who live in conditions of daily terror from the random and arbitrary violence of their own governments, some of whom are supported by Western states. At the present juncture, it also functions to silence the voices of those who experience Western policies – directly, as in those tortured in the war on terror, and indirectly, as in those suffering under Western-supported regimes – as a form of terrorism. That is, it deflects and diverts attention from the much greater state terrorism which blights the lives of tens of millions of people around the world today. Related to these broader normative and ideological effects, the treatment of state terrorism within the discourse – the silences on it and the narrow construction of ‘state-sponsored terrorism’ – also functions to position state terrorism (should it even exist within the dominant framework) as seemingly less important than non-state terrorism, and as confined to the actions that states take in support of non-state terrorism. This also distorts the field of knowledge and political practice by suggesting that the sponsorship of Palestinian groups by Iran for example, is an infinitely more serious and dangerous problem than the fact that millions of Colombians, Uzbeks, Zimbabweans, and so on, are daily terrorised by death squads, state torture, and serious human rights abuses. Within this discursive terrain, it can also function to provide legitimacy to Western policies such as sanctions, coercive diplomacy, and pre-emptive war against politically determined ‘state-sponsors of terrorism’ which may be terroristic themselves, and which ignore the involvement in state-sponsorship by Western states. From a political-normative viewpoint, the silence on state terrorism, and in particular the argument of many terrorism scholars that state actions can never be defined as ‘terrorism’, actually functions to furnish states with a rhetorical justification for using what may actually be terroristic forms of violence against their opponents and citizens without fear of condemnation. In effect, it provides them with greater leeway for applying terror-based forms of violence against civilians, a leeway exploited by many states such as Israel, Russia, China, Uzbekistan, Zimbabwe, and others who try to intimidate groups with the application of massive and disproportionate state violence. From this perspective, a discourse which occludes and obscures the very possibility of state terrorism can be considered part of the conditions that actually makes state terrorism possible. In addition, the silence on state terrorism within the field also functions to undermine the political struggle of human rights activists against the use of terror by states by disallowing the delegitimising power and resources that come from describing state actions as ‘terrorism’. It is pertinent to note in this context that the world’s leading states have continually rejected any and all attempts to legally define and proscribe a category of actions which would be called ‘state terrorism’, arguing instead that such actions are already covered by other laws such as the laws of war (Becker 2006). The silence on state terrorism has another political effect, namely, the way in which it has functioned, and continues to function, to distract from and deny the long history of Western involvement in terrorism, thereby constructing Western foreign policy as essentially benign – rather than aimed at reifying existing structures of power and domination in the international system, for example. That is, by preventing the effective criticism of particular Western policies it works to maintain the dangerous myth of Western exceptionalism. This sense of exceptionalism and the supportive discourse of terrorism studies permits Western states and their allies to pursue a range of discrete political projects and partisan interests aimed at maintaining international dominance. For example, by reinforcing the notion that non-state terrorism is a much greater threat and problem than state terrorism and by obscuring the ways in which counterterrorism can morph into state terrorism, the discourse functions to legitimise the current war on terror and its associated policies of military intervention, extraordinary rendition, reinforcement of the national security state, and the like. More specifically, the discourse can provide legitimacy to broader counter-insurgency or counterterrorism programmes where the actual aims lie in the maintenance of a particular political–economic order such as is occurring in Colombia at present (Stokes 2006). Importantly, the silence on state terrorism also functions to de-legitimise all forms of violent counter-hegemonic or revolutionary struggle (by maintaining the notion that state violence is automatically legitimate and all non-state violence is inherently illegitimate), thereby maintaining the liberal international order and many oppressive international power structures (also Duffield 2001). Lastly, the discourse can be used to selectively justify particular projects of regime change,13 economic sanctions, military base expansion, military occupation, military assistance for strategic partners, and the isolation of disapproved political movements such as Hamas or Hezbollah. In the end, the discourse functions to permit the reification and extension of state hegemony both internationally and domestically, and perhaps more importantly, the belief in the instrumental rationality of violence as an effective tool of politics. Despite the intentions of terrorism scholars therefore, who may feel that they engage in objective academic analysis of a clearly defined phenomenon, the discourse actually serves a number of distinctly political purposes and has several important ideological consequences for society.</p></div></div></td><td>4/26/14</td></tr><tr><td style="width:100%; word-break:break-all; word-break:break-word;"><div><p><input onclick="saveEntry(6)" src="../../xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" tppabs="http://hspolicy13.debatecoaches.org/xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" style="float:right;" title="Save" type="image" value="Save"></input>

The news was remarkable simply for being so unremarkable. No parades in Miami or demonstrations in Havana. No violence. Just an announcement: In 2018, Raul would turn over the reins of power.<br/>Oh, and everyone after Castro would face term limits. Go figure.<br/>After maintaining a stranglehold on Cuba for almost 60 years, the longest-running dictatorship in the world will cease to exist. It isn’t happening at the point of a bayonet or from a popular uprising, but rather because of time. When Raul steps down, Fidel will be approaching 92 and Raul 87.<br/>The man the Castros have chosen as successor is newly appointed Vice President Miguel Diaz-Canel. Diaz-Canel is seen as an effective manager and a steady though unspectacular mover in Cuba’s Communist Party. A career communist. Because of that, the speculation is that not much change will occur.<br/>But remember, the same was said of Mikhail Gorbachev when he took control of the Soviet Union.<br/>In a country defined by The Revolution, the impact of having a leader who is from the post-Revolution generation cannot be overstated. Diaz-Canel’s generation, which has grown up in the lean times of the embargo era, is more pragmatic and open to change.<br/>If the plan goes as scripted (past "successors," after all, simply disappeared from the political scene after being anointed), this could also be a great opportunity for the United States. The U.S.-led embargo of Cuba, which was started the same year that Diaz-Canel was born, 1960, and tightened in 1962 by then-President John F. Kennedy, has been devastating. Cuban diplomats claim it has cost their country 241 trillion since 1962.<br/>It has also been a black eye internationally for the U.S. In 2010, a Cuba-backed resolution asking for an end to the embargo passed the United Nations, 185-2.<br/>Once new leadership is in place, the U.S. should reconsider its position on the embargo.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HUSwilllifttheembargowhenDiaz-Canelistheleader2013currentpolicylimitstheembargotoCastro" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>US will lift the embargo when Diaz-Canel is the leader – current policy limits the embargo to Castro</span></h4><p>Estes, 13 – attended Harvard College where he was an editor at the Harvard Crimson and president of Current Magazine (Adam Clark, "Can You Imagine Cuba Without a Castro?", The Atlantic Wire, 2/24/13, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.theatlanticwire.com/global/2013/02/can-you-imagine-cuba-without-castro/62461/)//EX-http://www.theatlanticwire.com/global/2013/02/can-you-imagine-cuba-without-castro/62461/)/EX  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path excluded from retrieval by the project\%27s Exclusions properties.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.theatlanticwire.com/global/2013/02/can-you-imagine-cuba-without-castro/62461/)//EX-http://www.theatlanticwire.com/global/2013/02/can-you-imagine-cuba-without-castro/62461/)/EX%27" tppabs="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/global/2013/02/can-you-imagine-cuba-without-castro/62461/)//EX-http://www.theatlanticwire.com/global/2013/02/can-you-imagine-cuba-without-castro/62461/)/EX"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.theatlanticwire.com/global/2013/02/can-you-imagine-cuba-without-castro/62461/)//EX-http://www.theatlanticwire.com/global/2013/02/can-you-imagine-cuba-without-castro/62461/)/EX</span></a></span></p><p>Raul Castro announced in a speech on Sunday that he plans to step down as <br/>AND<br/>Cuba will almost certainly get a leader whose last name is not Castro.<br/>There had been some talk in the past about grooming a younger member of the <br/>AND<br/>that it must remain in place while a Castro is president of Cuba.<br/>Castro was careful to say that not too much will change when he steps down.

Diaz-Canel was not even born when Fidel Castro overthrew Fulgencio Batista in January 1959. Since then, a Castro has been in power in Cuba: first the now-retired, 86-year-old Fidel, and from 2006 to now, his younger brother, Raul, 81.<br/>This generational change does not mean that Cuba will move to a different political system. There is no going back to capitalism, Raul Castro told the National Assembly on Sunday. Nevertheless, the move toward a generational change must be seen in the context of other reforms implemented by the younger Castro.<br/>These reforms already are changing the face of Cuban socialism. Castro has introduced private <br/>AND<br/>, to travel abroad if they can get a visa from another country.<br/>While little is known of Diaz-Canel’s ideology, it is likely that as the appointed Castro successor he is on board with the reforms.<br/>The U.S. State Department reacted tepidly to Castro’s announcement and made clear that it would not be sufficient to prompt a lifting of the U.S. trade embargo. Although President Barack Obama doesn’t have election constraints in formulating a Cuba policy in his second term, the issue remains emotionally and politically charged in the U.S., and Congress is not likely to change its mind and lift the embargo while a Castro remains in power.<br/>That doesn’t mean relations can’t change, however.<br/>For instance, the Obama administration could remove Cuba from the list of states that sponsor terrorism. Cuba had been on that list since 1982, when it had the financial support of the Soviet Union and could afford to help guerrilla groups in Central and South America.<br/>Cuba doesn’t have the resources to help armed groups - or even the political will to do so. Cuba is not Syria, North Korea or Iran in terms of being a threat to the U.S.<br/>However, the lifting of the embargo is likely only after a period of more normal relations between the countries. There is also a legal obstacle: According to the Helms-Burton Act of 1996, the U.S. will recognize the legitimacy of a Cuban government only when someone other than a Castro is in power. For now, at least, it seems that won’t happen until 2018.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HAllSignspointtoDiaz-Canel2019sasnextinsecession" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>All Signs point to Diaz-Canel’s as next in secession</span></h4><p><strong>Miroff 13</strong> - correspondent for The Washington Post the Caribbean, senior correspondent for GlobalPost, contributor to National Public Radio.
