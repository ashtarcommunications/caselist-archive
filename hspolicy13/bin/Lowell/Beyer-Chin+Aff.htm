A good example of this is the role of observations of the climate system over the past one hundred years or more. In the current public discourse, the focus has been mostly on changes in global mean temperature. It would be easy to form the opinion that everything we know about climate change is based upon the observed rise in global temperatures and observed increase in carbon dioxide emissions since the industrial revolution. In other words, one could have the mistaken impression that the entirety of climate science is based upon a single correlation study. In reality, the correlation between global mean temperature and carbon dioxide over the 20th century forms an important, but very small part of the evidence for a human role in climate change. Our assessment of the future risk from the continued build up of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is even less informed by 20th century changes in global mean temperature. For example, our understanding of the greenhouse effect – the link between greenhouse gas concentrations and global surface air temperature – is based primarily on our fundamental understanding of mathematics, physics, astronomy and chemistry. Much of this science is textbook material that is at least a century old and does not rely on the recent climate record. For example, it is a scientific fact that Venus, the planet most similar to Earth in our solar system, experiences surface temperatures of nearly 500 degrees Celsius due to its atmosphere being heavily laden with greenhouse gases. Back on Earth, that fundamental understanding of the physics of radiation, combined with our understanding of climate change from the geological record, clearly demonstrates that increasing greenhouse gas concentrations will inevitably drive global warming. The observations we have taken since the start of 20th century have confirmed our fundamental understanding of the climate system. While the climate system is very complex, observations have shown that our formulation of the physics of the atmosphere and oceans is largely correct, and ever improving. Most importantly, the observations have confirmed that human activities, in particular a 40 increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations since the late 19th century, have had a discernible and significant impact on the climate system already. In the field known as detection and attribution of climate change, scientists use indicators known as of climate change. These fingerprints show the entire climate system has changed in ways that are consistent with increasing greenhouse gases and an enhanced greenhouse effect. They also show that recent, long term changes are inconsistent with a range of natural causes. A warming world is obviously the most profound piece of evidence. Here in Australia, the decade ending in 2010 has easily been the warmest since record keeping began, and continues a trend of each decade being warmer than the previous, that extends back 70 years. Globally, significant warming and other changes have been observed across a range of different indicators and through a number of different recording instruments, and a consistent picture has now emerged. Scientists have observed increases in continental temperatures and increases in the temperature of the lower atmosphere. In the oceans, we have seen increases in sea-surface temperatures as well as increases in deep-ocean heat content. That increased heat has expanded the volume of the oceans and has been recorded as a rise in sea-level. Scientists have also observed decreases in sea-ice, a general retreat of glaciers and decreases in snow cover. Changes in atmospheric pressure and rainfall have also occurred in patterns that we would expect due to increased greenhouse gases. There is also emerging evidence that some, though not all, types of extreme weather have become more frequent around the planet. These changes are again consistent with our expectations for increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide. Patterns of temperature change that are uniquely associated with the enhanced greenhouse effect, and which have been observed in the real world include: greater warming in polar regions than tropical regions greater warming over the continents than the oceans greater warming of night time temperatures than daytime temperatures greater warming in winter compared with summer a pattern of cooling in the high atmosphere (stratosphere) with simultaneous warming in the lower atmosphere (troposphere). By way of brief explanation, if the warming over the 20th century were due to some deep ocean process, we would not expect to see continents warming more rapidly than the oceans, or the oceans warming from the top down. For increases in solar radiation, we would expect to see warming of the stratosphere rather than the observed cooling trend. Similarly, greater global warming at night and during winter is more typical of increased greenhouse gases, rather than an increase in solar radiation. There is a range of other observations that show the enhanced greenhouse effect is real. The additional carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has been identified through its isotopic signature as being fossil fuel in origin. The increased carbon dioxide absorbed by the oceans is being recorded as a measured decrease in ocean alkalinity. Satellite measurements of outgoing long-wave radiation from the planet reveal increased absorption of energy in the spectral bands corresponding to carbon dioxide, exactly as expected from fundamental physics. It is important to remember that the enhanced greenhouse effect is not the only factor acting on the climate system. In the short term, the influence of greenhouse gases can be obscured by other competing forces. These include other anthropogenic factors such as increased industrial aerosols and ozone depletion, as well as natural changes in solar radiation and volcanic aerosols, and the cycle of El Niño and La Niña events. By choosing a range of indicators, by averaging over decades rather than years, and by looking at the pattern of change through the entire climate system, scientists are able to clearly discern the fingerprint of human-induced change. The climate of Earth is now a closely monitored thing; from instruments in space, in the deep ocean, in the atmosphere and across the surface of both land and sea. It’s now practically certain that increasing greenhouse gases have already warmed the climate system. That continued rapid increases in greenhouse gases will cause rapid future warming is irrefutable.</p><p>Warming reaches its tipping point within twenty-five years—9,200 studies prove—investment now is key<br/>Varma 9/30<br/>&nbsp;(Subodh, 9/30/13, Times of India, “Planet racing towards 2°C temperature rise: UN report,” <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/environment/global-warming/Planet-racing-towards-2C-temperature-rise-UN-report/articleshow/23277151.cms  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/environment/global-warming/Planet-racing-towards-2C-temperature-rise-UN-report/articleshow/23277151.cms%27" tppabs="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/environment/global-warming/Planet-racing-towards-2C-temperature-rise-UN-report/articleshow/23277151.cms"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/environment/global-warming/Planet-racing-towards-2C-temperature-rise-UN-report/articleshow/23277151.cms</span></a></span>, Accessed 10/27/13, JC)</p><p>The first is that the carbon accumulation in the atmosphere and resulting global warming have blown away the 2 degree Celsius tipping point that was earlier set. The present report says that to limit warming to a rise of 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, 1,000 gigatons (trillion metric tons) is the outer limit of carbon dioxide that can be emitted. However, by 2011 humans had already emitted 531 gigatons. That leaves very little wiggle room. According to climate change experts, the 1,000-gigaton limit may well be crossed in the next 25 years. ¶ The world has a total of 2,795 gigatons worth of carbon in the form of fossil fuels and reserves. Burning just 10 of these would take the earth over the tipping point. That's the stark message coming from the IPCC report. ¶ The report makes the second categorical assertion regarding sea level rise. It says that sea levels are projected to rise by 28-97 centimetres by 2100. This is over 50 more than the previous projection of 18-59 over the same period. This increase is mainly because of better estimation methods and more observations. By the year 2300, it is projected that seas will be higher by up to a cataclysmic 3 meters. ¶ Buried in the dense Summary for Policymakers, the report issued this week, is a series of future global scenarios. If you look at India, in the worst case scenario, temperatures will rise by up to 4 degrees Celsius and rainfall will increase by up to 20 over most of the sub-continent. Coupled with sea level along India's long coastline - on which are located megapolises like Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata - this spells a dire picture by the turn of this century. Of course, this is the worst case scenario, in which carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere have more than doubled from the present in the next 80-odd years. ¶ How scientific and robust is the IPCC's statements and predictions? The whole process involved 9,200 scientific studies, reviewed by 1089 experts from 55 countries working in a multistage process. They received 54, 677 comments from scientists across the world. Over 2 million gigabytes of numerical data was analyzed before 209 authors put together the draft report. Then representatives of 195 countries went over it word by word. ¶ Most scientists agree that the IPCC's reports are on the conservative side because they are forced to accommodate everybody, including governments that are wary of sounding too alarmist. In the present report, for instance, two observed facts leading to increasing carbon dioxide release are not fully taken aboard - the melting of permafrost and ocean acidification. Scientists have observed that both these on-going processes will cause an even greater amount of carbon dioxide to be released (or remain unabsorbed) than before. But these are not fully spelt out yet. Similarly warming of the deep sea (beyond 700 feet) is also not fully described or accounted for as the IPCC stopped collecting evidence 6 months ago, in order to start the consultation process. <br/>Tipping points prevent adaptation—significant emission cuts are key<br/>Hansen 8<br/>(James E.

As the planet warms, fast feedbacks include more water vapor, which traps additional heat, and less snow and sea ice, which exposes dark surfaces that absorb more sunlight. Slower feedbacks also exist. Due to warming, forests and shrubs are moving poleward into tundra regions. Expanding vegetation, darker than tundra, absorbs sunlight and warms the environment. Another slow feedback is increasing wetness (i.e., darkness) of the Greenland and West Antarctica ice sheets in the warm season. Finally, as tundra melts, methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, is bubbling out. Paleoclimatic records confirm that the long-lived greenhouse gases— methane, carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide—all increase with the warming of oceans and land. These positive feedbacks amplify climate change over decades, centuries, and longer. The predominance of positive feedbacks explains why Earth’s climate has historically undergone large swings: feedbacks work in both directions, amplifying cooling, as well as warming, forcings. In the past, feedbacks have caused Earth to be whipsawed between colder and warmer climates, even in response to weak forcings, such as slight changes in the tilt of Earth’s axis.2 The second fundamental property of Earth’s climate system, partnering with feedbacks, is the great inertia of oceans and ice sheets. Given the oceans’ capacity to absorb heat, when a climate forcing (such as increased greenhouse gases) impacts global temperature, even after two or three decades, only about half of the eventual surface warming has occurred. Ice sheets also change slowly, although accumulating evidence shows that they can disintegrate within centuries or perhaps even decades. The upshot of the combination of inertia and feedbacks is that additional climate change is already “in the pipeline”: even if we stop increasing greenhouse gases today, more warming will occur. This is sobering when one considers the present status of Earth’s climate. Human civilization developed during the Holocene (the past 12,000 years). It has been warm enough to keep ice sheets off North America and Europe, but cool enough for ice sheets to remain on Greenland and Antarctica. With rapid warming of 0.6°C in the past 30 years, global temperature is at its warmest level in the Holocene.3 The warming that has already occurred, the positive feedbacks that have been set in motion, and the additional warming in the pipeline together have brought us to the precipice of a planetary tipping point. We are at the tipping point because the climate state includes large, ready positive feedbacks provided by the Arctic sea ice, the West Antarctic ice sheet, and much of Greenland’s ice. Little additional forcing is needed to trigger these feedbacks and magnify global warming. If we go over the edge, we will transition to an environment far outside the range that has been experienced by humanity, and there will be no return within any foreseeable future generation. Casualties would include more than the loss of indigenous ways of life in the Arctic and swamping of coastal cities. An intensified hydrologic cycle will produce both greater floods and greater droughts. In the US, the semiarid states from central Texas through Oklahoma and both Dakotas would become more drought-prone and ill suited for agriculture, people, and current wildlife. Africa would see a great expansion of dry areas, particularly southern Africa. Large populations in Asia and South America would lose their primary dry season freshwater source as glaciers disappear. A major casualty in all this will be wildlife.<br/>Carbon cycling means warming depends only on future emissions—CO2 reductions now are key<br/>Matthews and Solomon 4/26<br/>(H.

The notion that there will be additional future warming or "warming in the pipeline'' if the atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide were to remain fixed at current lev- els (7) has been misinterpreted to mean that the rate of increase in Earth's global tempera- ture is inevitable, regardless of how much or how quickly emissions decrease (2—4). Fur- ther misunderstanding may stem from recent studies showing that the warming that has already occurred as a result of past anthropo- genic carbon dioxide increases is irreversible on a time scale of at least 1000 years (5, 6).¶ But irreversibility of past changes does not mean that further warming is unavoidable.¶ The climate responds to increases in atmospheric C02 concentrations by warm- ing, but this warming is slowed by the long time scale of heat storage in the ocean, which represents the physical climate iner- tia. There would indeed be unrealized warming associated with current CO2 con- centrations, but only if they were held fixed at current levels (7). If emissions decrease enough, the CO2 level in the atmosphere can also decrease. This potential for atmospheric CO2 to decrease over time results from iner- tia in the carbon cycle associated with the slow uptake of anthropogenic C02 by the ocean. This carbon cycle inertia affects tem- perature in the opposite direction from the physical climate inertia and is of approxi- mately the same magnitude (2, 6).¶ Because of these equal and opposing effects of physical climate inertia and car- bon cycle inertia, there is almost no delayed warming from past CO2 emissions. If emis-¶ sions were to cease abruptly, global average temperatures would remain roughly con- stant for many centuries, but they would not increase very much, if at all. Similarly, if emissions were to decrease, temperatures would increase less than they otherwise would have (see the first figure).¶ Thus, although the C02-induced warming already present on our planet—the cumula- tive result of past emissions—is irreversible, any further increase in CO,-induced warm- ing is entirely the result of current C02 emis- sions. Warming at the end of this century and beyond will depend on the cumulative emissions we emit between now and then. But future warming is not unavoidable: CO2 emissions reductions would lead to an imme- diate decrease in the rate of global warming.¶ Why, then, are many different near-term projections of C02-induced warming very similar? These modeled estimates are similar because even socioeconomic scenarios that produce very different cumulative emissions by the end of this century are not very differ-¶ ent over the next two decades (figs. S1 and S2). The climate system physics implies that fur- ther increases in warming could in principle be stopped immediately, but human systems have longer time scales. Carbon-emitting infrastructure is designed to benefit human- kind for many decades; each year's additional infrastructure implies added stock intended to last and emit C02 for many decades. It is this dependence on C02-emitting technology that generates a commitment to current and near- future emissions (7). Cleaner alternatives are being developed and carbon capture and stor- age technologies are being tested, but techno- logical development and diffusion are sub- ject to substantial inertia (8). Societal inertia, rather than the inertia of the climate system, is thus the critical challenge if we wish to begin to decrease the rate of CO2-induced global warming in the near future.¶ The strong dependence of future warm- ing on future cumulative carbon emissions implies that there is a quantifiable cumula- tive amount of CO2 emissions that we must not exceed if we wish to keep global tem- perature below 2°C above preindustrial tem- peratures. Several recent analyses have sug- gested that total CO, emissions of 1000 Pg C (-3700 Pg CO2; f Pg = 1015 g) would give us about even odds of meeting the 2°C target (9—12). To meet such a target given histori- cal emissions would mean that the world has roughly half of the allowable emissions bud- get remaining. This is equivalent to 50 years of emissions at current levels and carries the implication that the longer we delay before beginning to decrease emissions, the faster¶ the rate of decrease must be to stay within this total allowable budget (13).¶ Emissions differ widely between countries, par- ticularly between those in the developed and devel- oping world (14). Cumu- lative carbon emissions from the developed world currently exceed those from developing coun- tries, but rapid economic growth in emerging econo- mies is expected to reverse this pattern within a few decades (fig. S2). Nonethe- less, per capita cumulative emissions from developed countries are expected to remain far higher than those from developing nations throughout the 21 st¶ century (see the second fig- ure). If technological investments and innova- tion increase the availability of reduced-car- bon sources of energy that are competitive in price, development can continue to improve the lives of people in emerging economies without driving global climate change to increasingly dangerous levels. If reduced-car- bon energy sources are not advanced rapidly, a great deal of carbon-intensive infrastructure¶ is likely to be put in place in the developing world, implying a large and ongoing societal commitment to further global CO2 emissions and consequent climate warming (7).¶ Given the irreversibility of CO2-induced warming (5, 6), every increment of avoided temperature increase represents less warm- ing that would otherwise persist for many centuries. Although emissions reductions cannot return global temperatures to pre- industrial levels, they do have the power to avert additional warming on the same time scale as the emissions reductions themselves. Climate warming tomorrow, this year, this decade, or this century is not predetermined by past CO, emissions; it is yet to be deter- mined by future emissions. The climate ben- efits of emissions reductions would thus occur on the same time scale as the political decisions that lead to the reductions.</p><p>Mexico solve biofuels best—<br/>A) Genetic diversity— 300 eco-friendly jatropha strains spread with more investment<br/>Rosenberg 9<br/>(Mica Rosenberg and Rosario Izapa, 3/11/9, Reuters, “Toxic jatropha shrub fuels Mexico's biodiesel push,” <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/03/11/us-mexico-biofuel-idUSTRE52A0JB20090311  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/03/11/us-mexico-biofuel-idUSTRE52A0JB20090311%27" tppabs="http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/03/11/us-mexico-biofuel-idUSTRE52A0JB20090311"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/03/11/us-mexico-biofuel-idUSTRE52A0JB20090311</span></a></span>, Accessed 11/13/13, JC)</p><p>Mexico passed a law last year to push developing biofuels that don't threaten food security and the agriculture ministry has since identified some 2.6 million hectares (6.4 million acres) of land with a high potential to produce jatropha.¶ "If I had more land I would plant it because they say it's good business," Cardenas said, surrounded by rare rambutan and mangosteen fruit trees.¶ Demand for the eco-friendly fuel could grow now that U.S. President Barack Obama has promised to invest $150 billion over 10 years in renewable energy infrastructure.¶ GENETIC DIVERSITY¶ Continental Airlines ran a two-hour test flight in January of a Boeing 737 passenger plane powered with a mix of jatropha and algae-based biodiesel, following the lead of Japanese and New Zealand airline companies.¶ "The biofuel mix actually ran more efficiently and burned less fuel in total than the conventional (jet-fuel powered) engine," Steve Lott, a spokesman for the International Air Transport Association, or IATA, said.¶ The airline industry will consume 67 billion gallons of fuel this year, or 6 percent of the world's oil, a concern for environmentalists as well as airline budgets, especially after the spike in gas prices last year, Lott said.¶ The IATA wants all its members to use 10 percent renewable fuels by 2017. The challenge will be to ramp up output of green fuels at a rate fast enough to meet growing demand.¶ Mexico is running tests to find jatropha varieties that produce the most oil with the least care. Some 300 different types are being monitored at a government research center in Rosario Izapa, near Mexico's border with Guatemala.¶ In Guatemala, entrepreneur Ricardo Asturias has been promoting jatropha for the past eight years and now has his own plantations and biodiesel factory. He says the region's genetic diversity will give it an edge over competitors in Asia.¶ "This plant is native to Mesoamerica. In our nurseries we have 57 different varieties and we're not finished yet," he said.

Our country¶ has a great potential to become an important world producer of biofuels. 51¶ The program has identified a number of priority areas including:¶ • Providing incentives for feed stocks for biofuel production¶ • Promoting scientific development and cutting edge technologies for crops with potential¶ • Encouraging the use of integrated technology approaches¶ • Provide advice to producers for the creation of feed stock firms¶ • Provide coordination and collaboration between key actors¶ To date, however, there has been only minor cooperation between the United States and Mexico at the¶ governmental level. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has worked with SAGARPA on¶ a number of technical issues, and prepared a report on the Mexican biofuels sector in 2009 that pointed¶ to the potential for growth in the market and to the changing regulatory landscape for biofuels in¶ Mexico. This report highlighted the prospect of higher levels of demand for biodiesel thanks to the¶ setting of a national goal to introduce at least 5 of biodiesel in the transportation sector by 2012.¶ But the main interest has come from the US private sector that is looking to invest in biofuels production¶ in Mexico with an eye to exporting the product either back to the US or to Europe. With small scale¶ projects popping up across the country, US firms have begun to evaluate the potential for large?scale¶ production of biofuels. Global Clean Energy (GCE), a Los Angeles?based firm that specializes in¶ feedstocks for the production of biofuels, has recently invested in two jatropha farms in Mexico and one¶ in Belize. Jatropha, a hardy shrub that produces a nut with very high oil content that can be processed¶ into biodiesel, is seen by many as a perfect biofuel feedstock for Mexico. Native to the Mesoamerican¶ region, the plant grows on marginal land, is not edible either for humans or animals, and thus does not¶ generate food vs fuel controversy, and can be planted on land that is also used for grazing goats or¶ sheep. In addition to being a feedstock for biofuels, the harvest can be used as a source of biomass for¶ producing energy and the nuts themselves can be detoxified and processed for animal feed after their¶ oil has been expressed.¶ GCE has 5,000 acres under cultivation in Yucatan, and has adopted a sustainable business model that has resulted in jobs, fair wages and community development in the local area. 52 This is one of the dimensions of the biofuels industry that is only infrequently mentioned but that is important to note. It is increasingly common for businesses focusing on biofuels production to develop a model that emphasizes both profitability and sustainable development. Pioneer Global Renewables, a U.S. firm from San Francisco that has already invested in jatropha plantations in the Dominican Republic, is also looking to expand into Mexico and has a similar model to GCE, focusing on local community development, fair prices for harvests, and minimal negative impact on the environment. Jatropha, however, is only one of a multitude of biofuels that has potential in Mexico. Sugar, a long depressed industry in the country, could receive a significant boost if large scale ethanol production were contemplated. A large number of sugar mills are currently lying dormant, and could be retrofitted relatively cheaply to produce ethanol. For example: According to the Mexican Sugarcane Producers Association, only two mills have the capability of producing ethanol with the technical requirements specified by PEMEX, equating to about 10 million liters per year. If these mills upgraded their facilities and operated at full capacity and efficiency, it is calculated that total production capacity for ethanol could reach 170 million liters per year. 53 The sugarcane-to-ethanol industry will also have to overcome labor and taxation issues if it is to become commercially viable in Mexico. At present ethanol is subject to a luxury tax of 50 percent, which makes the production of ethanol for fuel uncompetitive at the moment. Another option exists in the incipient algae to ethanol industry, which is receiving considerable attention because of the potential for using algae cultivations as a way to capture carbon dioxide, and can be located in almost any climate. U.S. firms that possess the technology to increase efficiency in this field, such as Phyco2, a California-based firm, are already looking into the possibility of bringing their product to market in Mexico. 54 Biofuels innovations indigenous to Mexico will also be of interest to U.S. firms. Recent research into the potential of succulents and, in particular, agave show enormous promise. The agave plant has very high concentrations of sugar and produces more sugar per acre planted than sugarcane. A research team working at the Universidad Autonoma de Chapingo has esti mated that the variety Agave tequilana weber can yield up to 2,000 gallons of distilled ethanol per acre per year and from 12,000-18,000 gallons per acre per year if their cellulose is included, whereas: Corn ethanol, for example, has an energy balance ratio of 1.3 and produces approximately 300-400 gallons of ethanol per acre. Soybean biodiesel, with an energy balance of 2.5, typically can yield 60 gallons of biodiesel per acre while an acre of sugarcane can produce 600-800 gallons of ethanol with an energy balance of 8.0. An acre of poplar trees can yield more than 1,500 gallons of cellulosic ethanol with an energy balance of 12.0, according to a National Geographic study published in October 2007. 55 In addition to the impressive potential for producing ethanol, agave is an attractive crop as it can grow in harsh environments, requires relatively little water, can be used to produce a wide variety of products, such as paper, textiles, and rope, and is common across Mexico.<br/>Three internal links to warming:<br/>A) Carbon farming—Jatropha plantations halt the current trend of C02 emissions—each hectare captures 25 tons of C02 per year<br/>Harball and Climatewire 13 (Elizabeth, news source that provides coverage of the debate over climate policy and its effects on business, the environment and society, “Could Carbon Farms Reverse Global Warming? “, Scientific American, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=could-carbon-farms-reverse-global-warming  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=could-carbon-farms-reverse-global-warming%27" tppabs="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=could-carbon-farms-reverse-global-warming"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=could-carbon-farms-reverse-global-warming</span></a></span>, accessed 12/20/13, TC)</p><p>A recent study by German researchers presents the possibility of "carbon farming" as a less risky alternative to other carbon capture and storage technologies. It suggests that a significant percentage of atmospheric CO2 could potentially be removed by planting millions of acres of a hardy little shrub known as Jatropha curcas, or the Barbados nut, in dry, coastal areas.¶ But other experts raised doubts about the study's ambitious projections, questioning whether the Barbados nut would be able to grow well in sandy desert soils and absorb the quantity of carbon their models predict.¶ The researchers behind the study say Barbados nut plantations could help to mitigate the local effects of global warming in desert areas, causing a decrease in average temperature and an increase in precipitation. If a large enough portion of the Earth were blanketed with carbon farms, they say, these local effects could become global, capturing between 17 and 25 metric tons of CO2 per hectare each year over a 20-year period.¶ "All the other techniques we know about just prevent emission, nothing else," said lead author Klaus Becker of the University of Hohenheim in Stuttgart, Germany. "Only plants are able to extract carbon dioxide from the air."¶ The study, published in the journal Earth System Dynamics, states that if 730 million hectares of land -- an area about three-quarters the size of the United States -- were devoted to this method of carbon farming, the current trend of rising atmospheric CO2 levels could be halted.¶ Carbon farms would not compete with food production if they were concentrated in dry coastal areas, the researchers said. In their scenario, oceanside desalination plants, partially powered by biomass harvested from the plantations themselves, provide a low-emissions irrigation method.¶ Could huge plantations change weather patterns?¶ The study states that the Barbados nut is uniquely suited to growing in regions inhospitable to other crops. The plant, which produces a nonedible seed that can be used to create biodiesel, is comfortable growing at temperatures exceeding 100 degrees Fahrenheit. It can also withstand high levels of contamination in the soil, making wastewater another potential source for irrigation.¶ Additionally, the plant grows rapidly and develops "pretty large roots below the soil, which is important for carbon binding," said co-author Volker Wulfmeyer, also of the University of Hohenheim. As part of their research, Wulfmeyer and Becker traveled to a Barbados nut plantation in Luxor, Egypt, to collect physical samples from the plants to estimate their carbon-storing potential.¶ There are about 1 billion hectares of desert land in coastal areas that could be used for Barbados nut plantations, the researchers estimate, located in countries such as Mexico, Namibia, Saudi Arabia and Oman. If the entirety of this land were used for carbon farming, the study found, atmospheric carbon dioxide could be reduced by 17.5 parts per million over two decades, or 16.6 percent of the CO2 increase since the start of the Industrial Revolution.¶ But less ambitious projects may also have an impact. Using models, the researchers projected that 100-square-kilometer plantations in Oman and Mexico's Sonoran Desert could cause temperatures to fall by more than 1 degree Celsius. The model also saw a precipitation increase of 11 millimeters per year in Oman and 30 millimeters per year in the Sonoran.</p><p>B) i.

It also developed another machine to convert the empty shells into a fuel that could be used instead of coal in a chulha. As for the seed, it was crushed in a mechanical oil expeller, resulting in two by-products: a liquid layer of crude glycerol and another layer of crude bio-diesel.</p><p>ii.

These products are less controversial, some are closer to market than second generation biofuels, and yet do not enjoy the wealth of supportive supply and demand policies as seen with biofuels.¶ Several sources predict that biobased chemicals could in the near future occupy a much larger market share than at present. As befits the remarkable biodiversity of microorganisms, the diversity of potential biobased chemicals is wide. In many cases, organic chemistry has no feasible replacement; in other cases, biobased chemicals can replace their fossil-based counterparts with significant GHG emissions reductions.¶ Plastics from fossil fuels have grown faster than any other group of bulk materials for several decades. By 2100, a predicted 1 billion tonnes annual plastics demand would require 25 of current oil production. Biobased plastics are potentially attractive in terms of specific emissions and energy savings. In recent years biobased plastics have been developed for increasing types of applications, way beyond simple packaging applications as once envisaged. Estimates of total technical substitution potential for petro- with bio- plastics is 33-90 and yet global bioplastics consumption is a mere 0.4 of total plastics. As biobased plastics become proven in GHG emissions reductions, they should become an obvious target for supportive policy.¶ This paper explores the potential role of industrial biotechnology in the biobased economy. Along the way it examines emerging trends, the impact of innovation, the convergence of technologies, and goes on to identify the challenges involved. It concludes with a need for an integrated and strategic approach to allow industrial biotechnology to fulfil its potential as a force for good, not a panacea, in the struggle with climate change. Industrial biotechnology has suffered a lack of investment at all levels, and there is a serious mismatch between future expectations of this industry and this low level of investment. Policy intervention is seen to be required across three broad criteria – social/ environmental, industrial performance and economical. To make this all happen requires not only national but international policy in a rapidly globalising world.¶ 6 INDUSTRIAL BIOTECHNOLOGY AND CLIMATE CHANGE: OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES – © OECD 2011¶ Introduction¶ Climate change is challenging almost all human endeavours, including the future ways in which energy will be generated and consumed. It could adversely affect water supplies and agricultural productivity, and the need to cut CO2 emissions to avoid harmful environmental degradation has made the transition from conventional fossil fuels to alternative and renewable resources a global priority. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) (2010)1¶ has noted that “doubling of wealth leads to 80 higher CO2 emissions”. Therefore there is a need to break the link between growth and increasing emissions at the expense of sustainability.¶ Meeting market demands whilst at the same time reducing the impact on the climate is of critical importance to industry. Although past discussions have centred around the causes of climate change, society, industry, governments and other stakeholders are now searching for solutions to mitigate the impacts on health and the environment. In most countries, industrial greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have substantially decreased over recent years. Both regulators and industry have responded to the need to work towards a sustainable future and have focused on developing and innovating technological improvements for the benefit of the environment. However, in spite of these endeavours, current practices and technologies will most likely be insufficient or inadequate to achieve the ambitious objectives set by countries to tackle climate change. Industries should take bold steps towards establishing more sustainable growth and should be given the opportunity to implement new technologies including the use of biotechnology to reduce the carbon footprint.¶ With the Kyoto Protocol due to expire in 2012, parties to the United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change (UNFCCC) are currently in the process of negotiating a new treaty. It is critical that current and emerging uses of biotechnology are recognised by stakeholders as being part of the toolkit necessary to achieve sustainable solutions to climate change. Furthermore, it is also of vital importance that a new worldwide climate change agreement both supports and enables the implementation of eco-friendly innovations.¶ The over-arching goal of this paper is to explore how industrial biotechnology can be used as part of the toolkit in the struggle to control climate change. For this to happen, the products of industrial biotechnology (biofuels, biobased chemicals and bioplastics) have to be demonstrated to produce less GHG emissions than their non-biological counterparts, whilst maintaining product performance.¶ INDUSTRIAL BIOTECHNOLOGY AND CLIMATE CHANGE: OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES – © OECD 2011 7¶ Industrial biotechnology as part of the solution to climate change¶ Since the industrial revolution, economic growth has been inextricably linked with accelerating negative environmental impact. Industrial biotechnology challenges this pattern and has the potential to break the cycle of resource consumption by allowing for a rethinking of traditional industrial processes. Industrial biotechnology, by providing a range of options for competitive industrial performance in selected sectors, could enhance economic growth, while at the same time save water, energy, raw materials and reduce waste production.¶ Industrial biotechnology, based on renewable resources, can save energy in production processes and significantly reduce CO2 emissions.2 The impacts of biotechnology on industry are confirmed by scientific studies and reports, such as the OECD’s report on the application of biotechnology to industrial sustainability3 and, more recently, by a EuropaBio report (2009) on the potential of industrial biotechnology to help mitigate climate change.4¶ It has been claimed that the full climate change mitigation potential of biotechnology processes and biobased products ranges from between 1 billion and 2.5 billion tons CO2 equivalent per year by 2030. To put this in context, it represents more than Germany’s total reported emissions in 1990. Even though the industrial biotechnology sector is still embryonic, it globally avoids the creation of 33 million tonnes of CO2 each year through various applications, without taking ethanol use into consideration, whilst globally emitting 2 million tonnes of CO2.¶ 8 INDUSTRIAL BIOTECHNOLOGY AND CLIMATE CHANGE: OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES – © OECD 2011¶ The role of industrial biotechnology in the biobased economy¶ Industrial biotechnology, also known as white biotechnology, uses enzymes and micro-organisms to make biobased products in sectors as diverse as chemicals, food and feed, healthcare, detergents, paper and pulp, textiles and energy. Agricultural products, biomass and organic waste, including food processing waste and effluents (also referred to as renewable raw materials) are transformed into other substances, in the same way as crude oil is used as a feedstock in the production of chemicals.¶ Existing energy infrastructure and production processes are largely based on fossil fuels, which result in high levels of GHG emissions. In a biobased economy society is no longer wholly dependent on fossil fuels and industrial raw materials.¶ By contrast, industrial biotechnology holds promise by avoiding the use of limited fossil resources as starting materials, but in some instances it competes with edible feedstocks. This important issue, specially raised in the case of biofuels, can be solved by the introduction of second generation biofuels using non-edible biomass as a sole feedstock. Besides biofuels, the wide variety of intermediate products that may enter at different stages in different value chains introduces complexity when analysing biotechnological products. The OECD predicts the following industrial biotechnology applications have a high probability of reaching the market by 2030:5¶ • Improved enzymes for a growing range of applications in the chemical sector.¶ • Improved micro-organisms that can produce an increasing number of chemical products in one step, some of which build on genes identified through bioprospecting.¶ • Biosensors for real-time monitoring of nvironmental pollutants and biometrics for identifying people.<br/>The impact is global warming.<br/>Ocean acidification causes mass extinctions<br/>Ward 10 (Peter, PhD, professor of Biology and Earth and Space Sciences at the University of Washington, paleontologist and NASA astrobiologist, Fellow at the California Academy of Sciences, The Flooded Earth: Our Future in a World Without Ice Caps, June 29, 2010)<br/> <br/>In the rest of this chapter I will support a contention that within several millennia (or less) the planet will see a changeover of the oceans from their current “mixed” states to something much different and dire. Oceans will become stratified by their oxygen content and temperature, with warm, oxygen-free water lining the ocean basins. Stratified<br/>&nbsp;oceans like this in the past (and they were present for most of Earth’s history) have always been preludes to biotic catastrophe. Because the continents were in such different positions at that time, models we use today to understand ocean current systems are still crude when it comes to analyzing the ancient oceans, such as those of the Devonian or Permian Periods. Both times witnessed major mass extinctions, and these extinctions were somehow tied to events in the sea. Yet catastrophic as it was, the event that turned the Canning Coral Reef of Devonian age into the Canning Microbial Reef featured at the start of this chapter was tame compared to that ending the 300 million- to 251 million-year-old Permian Period, and for this reason alone the Permian ocean and its fate have been far more studied than the Devonian. But there is another reason to concentrate on the Permian mass extinction: it took place on a world with a climate more similar to that of today than anytime in the Devonian. Even more important, it was a world with ice sheets at the poles, something the more tropical Devonian Period may never have witnessed. For much of the Permian Period, the Earth, as it does today, had abundant ice caps at both poles, and there were large-scale continental glaciations up until at least 270 million years ago, and perhaps even later.4 But from then until the end of the Permian, the planet rapidly warmed, the ice caps disappeared, and the deep ocean bottoms filled with great volumes of warm, virtually oxygen-free seawater. The trigger for disaster was a short-term but massive infusion of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere at the end of the Permian from the spectacular lava outpourings over an appreciable portion of what would become northern Asia. The lava, now ancient but still in place, is called the “Siberian Traps,” the latter term coming from the Scandinavian for lava flows. The great volcanic event was but the start of things, and led to changes in oceanography. The ultimate kill mechanism seems to have been a lethal combination of rising temperature, diminishing oxygen, and influx into water and air of the highly poisonous compound hydrogen sulfide. The cruel irony is that this latter poison was itself produced by life, not by the volcanoes. The bottom line is that life produced the ultimate killer in this and surely other ancient mass extinctions. This finding was one that spurred me to propose the Medea Hypothesis, and a book of the same name.5 Hydrogen sulfide poisoning might indeed be the worst biological effect of global warming. There is no reason that such an event cannot happen again, given short-term global warming. And because of the way the sun ages, it may be that such events will be ever easier to start than during the deep past. How does the sun get involved in such nasty business as mass extinction? Unlike a campfire that burns down to embers, any star gets ever hotter when it is on the “main sequence,” which is simply a term used to described the normal aging of a star—something like the progression we all go through as we age. But new work by Jeff Kiehl of the University of Colorado shows that because the sun keeps getting brighter, amounts of CO2 that in the past would not have triggered the process result in stagnant oceans filled with H2S-producing microbes. His novel approach was to estimate the global temperature rise to be expected from carbon dioxide levels added to the energy hitting the earth from the sun. Too often we refer to the greenhouse effect as simply a product of the gases. But it is sunlight that actually produces the heat, and that amount of energy hitting the earth keeps increasing. He then compared those to past times of mass extinctions. The surprise is that a CO2 level of 1,000 ppm would—with our current solar radiation—make our world the second hottest in Earth history—when the five hottest were each associated with mass extinction. In the deep history of our planet, there have been at least five short intervals in which the majority of living species suddenly went extinct. Biologists are used to thinking about how environmental pressures slowly choose the organisms most fit for survival through natural selection, shaping life on Earth like an artist sculpting clay. However, mass extinctions are drastic examples of natural selection at its most ruthless, killing vast numbers of species at one time in a way hardly typical of evolution. In the 1980s, Nobel Prize-winning physicist Luis Alvarez, and his son Walter Alvarez, first hypothesized that the impact of comets or asteroids caused the mass extinctions of the past.6 Most scientists slowly come to accept this theory of extinction, further supported by the discovery of a great scar in the earth—an impact crater—off the coast of Mexico that dates to around the time the dinosaurs went extinct. An asteroid probably did kill off the dinosaurs, but the causes of the remaining four mass extinctions are still obscured beneath the accumulated effects of hundreds of millions of years, and no one has found any credible evidence of impact craters. Rather than comets and asteroids, it now appears that short-term global warming was the culprit for the four other mass extinctions. I detailed the workings of these extinctions first in a 1996 Discover magazine article,7 then in an October 2006 Scientific American article, and finally in my 2007 book, Under a Green Sky.8 In each I considered whether such events could happen again. In my mind, such extinctions constitute the worst that could happen to life and the earth as a result of short-term global warming. But before we get to that, let us look at the workings of these past events. The evidence at hand links the mass extinctions with a changeover in the ocean from oxygenated to anoxic bottom waters. The source of this was a change in where bottom waters are formed. It appears that in such events, the source of our earth’s deep water shifted from the high latitudes to lower latitudes, and the kind of water making it to the ocean bottoms was different as well: it changed from cold, oxygenated water to warm water containing less oxygen. The result was the extinction of deep-water organisms. Thus a greenhouse extinction is a product of a changeover of the conveyor-belt current systems found on Earth any time there is a marked difference in temperatures between the tropics and the polar regions. Let us summarize the steps that make greenhouse extinction happen. First, the world warms over short intervals due to a sudden increase in carbon dioxide and methane, caused initially by the formation of vast volcanic provinces called flood basalts. The warmer world affects the ocean circulation systems and disrupts the position of the conveyor currents. Bottom waters begin to have warm, low-oxygen water dumped into them. The warming continues, and the decrease of equator-to-pole temperature differences brings ocean winds and surface currents to a near standstill. The mixing of oxygenated surface waters with the deeper and volumetrically increasing low-oxygen bottom waters lessens, causing ever-shallower water to change from oxygenated to anoxic. Finally, the bottom water exists in depths where light can penetrate, and the combination of low oxygen and light allows green sulfur bacteria to expand in numbers, filling the low-oxygen shallows. The bacteria produce toxic amounts of H2S, with the flux of this gas into the atmosphere occurring at as much as 2,000 times today’s rates. The gas rises into the high atmosphere, where it breaks down the ozone layer. The subsequent increase in ultraviolet radiation from the sun kills much of the photosynthetic green plant phytoplankton. On its way up into the sky, the hydrogen sulfide also kills some plant and animal life, and the combination of high heat and hydrogen sulfide creates a mass extinction on land.9 Could this happen again? No, says one of the experts who write the RealClimate.org Web site, Gavin Schmidt, who, it turns out, works under Jim Hansen at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center near Washington, DC. I disagreed and challenged him to an online debate. He refused, saying that the environmental situation is going to be bad enough without resorting to creating a scenario for mass extinction. But special pleading has no place in science. Could it be that global warming could lead to the extinction of humanity? That prospect cannot be discounted. To pursue this question, let us look at what might be the most crucial of all systems maintaining habitability on Planet Earth: the thermohaline current systems, sometimes called the conveyor currents. It is both presumed and observed that current systems that run like a conveyor belt (it runs horizontally until ducking down, reversing direction, and returning up to its original starting point) are among the most important of the many ways that the earth redistributes heat from the sun. Such current systems have been present on Earth whenever there has been ice at the poles, and perhaps when there is no ice at all. In the past, short-term global warming caused perturbations to several of the conveyor current systems. Will the melting of Greenland and Antarctica cause such perturbations in the near, warmed future? Could these changes even be happening now? And if so, what might the consequences be? Today the most important of these currents appears to be the one that moves warm water north and east from the warm Gulf Stream of eastern North America. As that current moves into higher latitudes, its water cools and finally sinks. This cold, highly oxygenated water is a crucial part of maintaining a mix among the ocean’s gaseous elements, rather than allowing them to become stratified, with oxygenated tops and oxygen-free bottoms, like today’s Black Sea, or even totally anoxic from bottom to top. If the Gulf Stream-related current were to change the position where the water sinks, so that less-oxygenated warm water sinks from the surface or so that no water sinks at all, which would be the cessation of the current system, Europe might be immediately cooled, even in a globally warmed world, at least for a while. The result would certainly be a great change in the weather, which would certainly affect agriculture, and probably not for the better. In 2005, for the first time, a research group reported a slowing of the North Atlantic conveyor current, probably due to massive amounts of freshwater already entering the sea in northern areas due to the rapid melting of the northern ice cap.11 As this melt increases in volume, the current will be massively affected. Freshwater is of lower density than seawater, and it will float along the top of the ocean, effectively stopping the conveyor action of the current itself. Just how sensitive is the conveyor current to the sort of change that could lead to a major disturbance in the world’s climate—the kind of dramatic global change that in the past caused mass extinction? In other words, what would it take to cause a short-term but radical change in the conveyor current? Some climatologists regard the Atlantic current as robust; they believe that only massive changes in oceanography would be required to perturb it. But a larger number of scientists, including Richard B. Alley, in his now classic and important 2002 book The Two-Mile Time Machine, regard the Atlantic conveyor current system as very finely balanced and hence very susceptible to change .12 The easiest way to activate this change, according to sophisticated computer models, is to pump freshwater into the northern part of the system, and that is just what is happening today. The truly staggering rate at which Arctic ice is melting—a phenomenon not even noticed before about 2003—is introducing massive volumes of freshwater into the most dangerous point for the integrity of the conveyor current. And that input of freshwater is really just the tip of the melting iceberg. However, another way to change the system is by rapid global temperature rise, of sufficient magnitude to significantly reduce the temperature difference between poles and equator. The consequence of perturbation to this system is that the deep, cold, and oxygenated bottom water from high-latitude sinking will change to deep, warm, anoxic water that came from mid-latitude sinking. With that change a relatively cool world gives way to worldwide tropics. But could this happen again and if so, how soon? These questions stimulated an interesting NASA meeting in 2009. In January 2009 I received an unexpected telephone message from Dr. Carl Pilcher, director of the NASA Astrobiology Institute (NAI), summoning me to a spring meeting of the NASA Ames Research Center in Sunnyvale, California, to join a discussion on life and planetary change. It turned out that the director of Ames, former astronaut Pete Worden, had instigated the meeting to discuss the implications of short-term climate change on global biodiversity, past and present. Greenhouse extinction, in other words. Thus a small group composed of scientists who have each worked on either past mass extinctions or on the consequences of ancient climate change convened in welcome California warmth. We were all glad to meet with NASA, because it had been frustrating to see how little traction this concept had gotten with the public, other scientists, and the national agencies that fund scientific research. The other scientists attending were fellow paleontologist Doug Erwin of the Smithsonian; geochemists Lee Kump of Penn State and Ariel Anbar of Arizona State; biologist Jon Harrison, also of Arizona State; biochemist Roger Summons of MIT; and climate modeler Jeffrey Kiehl of Colorado. In making our presentation to a small cadre of NASA scientists and administrators, Summons, Erwin, and I conveyed data and information supporting the hypothesis that more than one of the past mass extinctions might have been caused by short-term global warming, with the devastating Permian mass extinction especially featured. Next, several scientists reported about the prospect of future greenhouse extinctions. Lee Kump of Penn State spoke first, and that was highly appropriate, for in 2005 he and colleagues first published the evidence suggesting that H2S played a major role in mass extinction. Kump showed the results of modeling of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans that investigated whether the gigantic thermohaline conveyor currents (integral to keeping the deep ocean oxygenated) could soon be affected by polar warming and the infusion of freshwater. He also added a new and important variable: the effect of enhanced nutrients to the deep ocean at the same time as global warming. He included this factor because the mechanism that he proposed for the Permian extinction, while triggered by global warming, had as its real “kill mechanism” the formation of vast quantities of hydrogen sulfide dissolved in the oceans (and at high enough concentrations, leaking into the atmosphere, literally bubbling out of the sea). For H2S to be produced by microbes from a group that used sulfur, not oxygen, for respiration, and to get large enough quantities of H2S to kill things, there would have to be a lot of nutrients down there. To my surprise, his findings indicated that both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans could see the start of oceanic slowdown not millennia hence, but early in the next century. The only factor in his scenario that Kump failed to take into account was rising sea level. It is this mechanism, perhaps more than any other, that would put the necessary nutrients onto the bottom of the sea, for as the many rivers and river mouths drowned, vast quantities of organic-rich silt and mud would be carried out to sea, where it would serve as fertilizer, rich in phosphates and nitrates that could stimulate the growth of the H2S-producing microbes, akin to fertilizing a garden bed filled with plants producing deadly poison. Jeffrey Kiehl, who was the day’s final presenter, also used models to look into the near future. He too saw signs that changing oceans are heading toward low &nbsp;oxygen and that warmed ocean bottoms could begin in the current century if current global warming persists. Yet in all of the models he neglected the topic of this book: the effects that rising sea level will have on global temperatures. Water absorbs heat from the sun and generally reflects back into space less energy than land surfaces do. Thus, all else being equal, the larger the ocean area, the greater the warming through reduced albedo (planetary reflectivity). It is a vicious circle, a positive feedback. Snow and ice melt, reducing albedo and raising sea level. As the sea rises, it absorbs ever more heat, causing more ice to melt at the poles, again raising sea level, and on and on. The result of this Ames meeting was a report that NASA said was headed to the desk of President Barack Obama’s science adviser. Whether it got there we never found out. But what we do know is that NASA has seemingly awakened to the vital connection between ancient climates and impending climate change. Although a number of scientists have tried to communicate this argument to the public, at the end of the first decade of the new millennium, few in the nation’s electronic media and print and newspapers allowed us to make our case. They did not disbelieve us; they just responded that the past scenarios were too horrifying for us to contemplate that they could happen again, and soon. Let us hope that a new generation will quickly decide to open their ears and listen.</p><p>CONTENTION 2 IS SOLVENCY<br/>The Export-Import bank is a crucial link between the developed and developing worlds—renewable technology transfer fosters social responsibility and global spillover<br/>Gong 6<br/>(Karis Anne, JD @ Berkeley, BA @ Princeton, “Exporting Sustainability: A proposal to reduce the climate impact of the Export?Import Bank of the United States,” p. 48-51, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.princeton.edu/~mauzeral/wws402d_s06/FinalDraftKarisGong.pdf  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.princeton.edu/~mauzeral/wws402d_s06/FinalDraftKarisGong.pdf%27" tppabs="http://www.princeton.edu/~mauzeral/wws402d_s06/FinalDraftKarisGong.pdf"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.princeton.edu/~mauzeral/wws402d_s06/FinalDraftKarisGong.pdf</span></a></span>, Accessed 11/24/13)</p><p>First, climate change is a result of aggregate emissions and aggregate concentrations ¶ of GHGs in the atmosphere. Small fluctuations may not seem to make a large difference. ¶ However, as in the tragedy of the commons where the individual cost of grazing is only a ¶ fraction of the individual benefit and where such cost-benefit analysis leads to over-grazing ¶ and the collapse of the commons, each additional unit of GHGs emitted contributes to ¶ untenable aggregate levels of GHGs.174 Thus, to the extent that the Bank is responsible for ¶ some of the emissions, as is the rest of the world, the Bank is responsible for cutting some ¶ of the emissions, an action required for stabilizing atmospheric levels of GHGs. In short, it ¶ has both the opportunity and responsibility to be environmentally conscientious. ¶ Second, the Bank’s role in the global economy is unique. Since it connects the ¶ products and expertise of the developed world to the needs of the developing world, it has ¶ the opportunity to engage developing countries in responding to climate change. One of the ¶ main obstacles in international climate negotiations continues to be the tension between ¶ economic development and environmental protection, which draw from concerns for ¶ “economic justice.”175 Developing countries understand that “today’s rich countries moved first from ¶ agriculture to manufacturing industries which use resources intensively, and later to services ¶ and less polluting types of manufacturing,”176 and many hold that it is better to “pollute now ¶ and clean up later.”177 They also recognize that the people in developed countries have ¶ emitted and continue emitting high levels of greenhouse gases. For many heads of state in the ¶ developing world, justice demands that the developed countries bear the brunt of addressing ¶ climate change. The Indian delegate to the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee on ¶ Climate Change (INC) session in Geneva argued: ¶ The problem of global warming is caused not by emissions of greenhouse gases as such, but by ¶ excessive levels of per capita emissions of these gases. If per capita emissions of all countries had ¶ been on the same levels as that of the developing countries, the world would not today have ¶ faced the threat of global warming. It follows, therefore, that developed countries with high per ¶ capita emission levels of greenhouse gases are responsible for incremental global warming. ¶ ¶ In these negotiations, the principle of equity should be the touchstone for judging any proposal. ¶ Those responsible for environmental degradation should also be responsible for taking corrective ¶ measures. Since developed countries with high per capita emissions of greenhouse gases are ¶ responsible for incremental global warming, it follows that they have a corresponding obligation ¶ to take corrective action. Moreover, these are also the countries which have the greatest capacity ¶ to bear the burden. It is they who possess the financial resources and the technology needed for ¶ corrective action. This further reinforces their obligations regarding corrective action.178¶ ¶ Developed nations, on the other hand, have argued that their own reductions in emissions will ¶ not produce any environmental gains if developing nations do not also agree to emissions ¶ targets. Fear that the emissions of developing nations would offset or surpass the emissions ¶ reductions gained by implementation of the Kyoto Protocol was one of the major reasons for ¶ U.S.’s refusal to even consider the ratification of the Protocol in the Senate.179 Furthermore, if¶ developing countries were not required to take action to reduce their emissions, the U.S. feared ¶ that domestic industries would suffer severe economic losses while developing countries ¶ hosted new industry growth. Senator Robert Byrd (R-WV), co-sponsor of the Byrd-Hagel ¶ Resolution, commented during the senate debate that: ¶ He did not think the Senate should support a treaty that requires only half the world – in ¶ other words, the developed countries – to endure the economic costs of reducing emissions ¶ while developing countries are left free to pollute the atmosphere, and in so doing, siphon off ¶ American industries… In this particular environmental game, there are no winners; the world ¶ loses. And any effort to avoid the effects of global climate change will be doomed to failure ¶ from the start without the participation of the developing world.180¶ ¶ Since the Bank is a public agency in a developed country and its business is principally ¶ in developing countries, it has a unique opportunity to address this conundrum. By instituting ¶ a policy to reduce its own emissions while maintaining its role as an export financing agent, it ¶ can serve as a U.S. example of accepting environmental responsibility. At the same time, the ¶ exporting of energy efficiency methodologies and cleaner forms of energy technology in order ¶ to achieve emissions reductions benefits and engages developing countries. By requiring the ¶ export of cleaner forms of energy to areas where infrastructure is just beginning to be built, the ¶ Bank can help establish renewables as feasible foundations of economic development. ¶ Introducing renewable energy infrastructure can then also reduce the barriers of consumer ¶ unfamiliarity and information asymmetries that currently tend to favor nonrenewable energy ¶ forms. Intentioned implementation of technology for the purpose of market experience is the ¶ first step toward that technology’s gaining more widespread use.181¶ Third, the Bank’s adoption of a GHG emissions reduction policy would allow it to press other export credit agencies under the OECD Common Arrangement to undertake ¶ similar measures. Its historic role as a leader among the OECD ECAs might afford it the ¶ political capital necessary to pursue widespread adoption of GHG reduction policies.182 If it is ¶ able to do so, the Bank will have influenced a significant proportion global financing policies – ¶ ECAs in 2001 covered about $800 billion of exports, and their activity “exceeds that of all ¶ multilateral development banks” including the World Bank and Asian Development Bank.183<br/>Mexico and US firms say yes—biofuel law creates stable investment ground<br/>Felix 8<br/>(Raul Felix, coordinator of the Climate Change and Renewable Energy Practice in Mexico for Baker and McKenzie, 2008, Biomass Magazine, “Assessing the Impact of Mexico's Biofuels Law,” <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://biomassmagazine.com/articles/1678/assessing-the-impact-of-mexico\%27s-biofuels-law  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://biomassmagazine.com/articles/1678/assessing-the-impact-of-mexico\%27s-biofuels-law%27" tppabs="http://biomassmagazine.com/articles/1678/assessing-the-impact-of-mexico%27s-biofuels-law"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://biomassmagazine.com/articles/1678/assessing-the-impact-of-mexico's-biofuels-law</span></a></span>, Accessed 11/20/13, JC)</p><p>Energy companies that have already developed the know-how and technology abroad or in Mexico for biofuel production and commercialization could clearly expand their horizons and consider Mexico as a viable market for mass commercialization, distribution or production of biofuels. <br/>Further, Mexico will grant companies privileged access to the North American, European, Japanese and Latin American markets. Prior to a regulation of biofuels in Mexico, the greatest fear among players in this sector was the potential re-interpretation of the existing norms for fossil fuels to expand their scope to incorporate biofuels. This was particularly important, because prior to the enactment of the biofuels law, PEMEX, as the preponderant player in the national energy market, could easily hinder the marketing of biofuels substitutes to its traditional fuel portfolio. Under this independent legal structure, other energy companies and start-ups could directly participate in the development of the biofuel market as long as their product proves to be competitive compared with the current fossil fuels offered in Mexico. <br/>Mexico has a wide array of topographic and climatic conditions that range from tropical forests in the southern part of the country, vast coastal areas, a mild climate in the central part of the country, and mountainous areas and arid regions that will allow the adaptation of several varieties of crops that have been used in other latitudes for successful biofuel projects. In addition, Mexico has already issued a law that will regulate the use of genetically modified organisms (the Biosafety Law for Genetically Modified Organism) that may potentially open the door for the use of specific types of energy crops under controlled conditions. <br/>Mexico's current administration has established as part of its National Strategy on Climate Change the need to diversify its fuel alternatives and to introduce the use of biofuels. It has also evidenced that, due to the fact that biofuels do not have a constitutional limitation for the participation of private investment, it wishes to open this sector to both national and foreign investment.</p><p>Yes transition—jatropha biofuels cost less than oil now and productivity’s still increasing<br/>Lane 12<br/>(Jim, 10/31/12, Biofuels Digest, “SG Biofuels expands jatropha platform; confirms $99 per barrel crude jatropha oil,” <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.biofuelsdigest.com/bdigest/2012/10/31/sg-biofuels-expands-jatropha-platform-confirms-99-per-barrel-crude-jatropha-oil/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.biofuelsdigest.com/bdigest/2012/10/31/sg-biofuels-expands-jatropha-platform-confirms-99-per-barrel-crude-jatropha-oil/%27" tppabs="http://www.biofuelsdigest.com/bdigest/2012/10/31/sg-biofuels-expands-jatropha-platform-confirms-99-per-barrel-crude-jatropha-oil/"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.biofuelsdigest.com/bdigest/2012/10/31/sg-biofuels-expands-jatropha-platform-confirms-99-per-barrel-crude-jatropha-oil/</span></a></span>, Accessed 11/20/13, JC)</p><p>In California, SG Biofuels announced at Advanced Biofuels Markets that it has expanded its global network of hybrid trial and agronomic research sites to 15 with the addition of eight new JMax Knowledge Centers in Guatemala, Brazil and India, and has achieved costs of $99 per barrel or less across three continents.<br/>By comparison, the Brent crude price is averaging $113.02 per barrel this month, according to Oilenergy.com.<br/>Fully loaded costs<br/>This cost is “all-in, fully loaded, from buying our seeds, growing, harvest, crush into crude, capex, opex, all of it,” noted SG Biofuels CEO Kirk Haney. “We’ve partnered with energy companies and planted side by side with local material, and seen 200-900 percent yield increases.”<br/>“All the airlines say that crude jatropha oil provides a best-of-breed biojet,” added Haney. “It’s been all about how to get the volume, the yield per acre, and we’ve solved that in a definitive way.<br/>Genetic improvements make current jatropha strains successful—prefer the more recent evidence<br/>SGB 13<br/>(2013, Seeds Genomics Biomaterials, “Jatropha 2.0,” <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.sgbiofuels.com/pages/jatropha2/index.php  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.sgbiofuels.com/pages/jatropha2/index.php%27" tppabs="http://www.sgbiofuels.com/pages/jatropha2/index.php"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.sgbiofuels.com/pages/jatropha2/index.php</span></a></span>, Accessed 11/18/13, JC)</p><p>Jatropha curcas is a non-edible shrub that is native to Central America.

I would like to suggest that it is time for American social critics who are enamored with this group, those who actually want to be relevant, to recognize that they have a disease, and a disease regarding which I myself must remember to stay faithful to my own twelve step program of recovery. The disease is the need for elaborate theoretical "remedies" wrapped in neological and multi-syllabic jargon. These elaborate theoretical remedies are more "interesting," to be sure, than the pragmatically settled questions about what shape democracy should take in various contexts, or whether private property should be protected by the state, or regarding our basic human nature (described, if not defined (heaven forbid!), in such statements as "We don't like to starve" and "We like to speak our minds without fear of death" and "We like to keep our children safe from poverty"). As Rorty puts it, "When one of today's academic leftists says that some topic has been 'inadequately theorized,' you can be pretty certain that he or she is going to drag in either philosophy of language, or Lacanian psychoanalysis, or some neo-Marxist version of economic determinism. . . . These futile attempts to philosophize one's way into political relevance are a symptom of what happens when a Left retreats from activism and adopts a spectatorial approach to the problems of its country. Disengagement from practice produces theoretical hallucinations"(italics mine).(1) Or as John Dewey put it in his The Need for a Recovery of Philosophy, "I believe that philosophy in America will be lost between chewing a historical cud long since reduced to woody fiber, or an apologetics for lost causes, . . . . or a scholastic, schematic formalism, unless it can somehow bring to consciousness America's own needs and its own implicit principle of successful action." Those who suffer or have suffered from this disease Rorty refers to as the Cultural Left, which left is juxtaposed to the Political Left that Rorty prefers and prefers for good reason. Another attribute of the Cultural Left is that its members fancy themselves pure culture critics who view the successes of America and the West, rather than some of the barbarous methods for achieving those successes, as mostly evil, and who view anything like national pride as equally evil even when that pride is tempered with the knowledge and admission of the nation's shortcomings. In other words, the Cultural Left, in this country, too often dismiss American society as beyond reform and redemption. And Rorty correctly argues that this is a disastrous conclusion, i.e. disastrous for the Cultural Left. I think it may also be disastrous for our social hopes, as I will explain. Leftist American culture critics might put their considerable talents to better use if they bury some of their cynicism about America's social and political prospects and help forge public and political possibilities in a spirit of determination to, indeed, achieve our country - the country of Jefferson and King; the country of John Dewey and Malcom X; the country of Franklin Roosevelt and Bayard Rustin, and of the later George Wallace and the later Barry Goldwater. To invoke the words of King, and with reference to the American society, the time is always ripe to seize the opportunity to help create the "beloved community," one woven with the thread of agape into a conceptually single yet diverse tapestry that shoots for nothing less than a true intra-American cosmopolitan ethos, one wherein both same sex unions and faith-based initiatives will be able to be part of the same social reality, one wherein business interests and the university are not seen as belonging to two separate galaxies but as part of the same answer to the threat of social and ethical nihilism. We who fancy ourselves philosophers would do well to create from within ourselves and from within our ranks a new kind of public intellectual who has both a hungry theoretical mind and who is yet capable of seeing the need to move past high theory to other important questions that are less bedazzling and "interesting" but more important to the prospect of our flourishing - questions such as "How is it possible to develop a citizenry that cherishes a certain hexis, one which prizes the character of the Samaritan on the road to Jericho almost more than any other?" or "How can we square the political dogma that undergirds the fantasy of a missile defense system with the need to treat America as but one member in a community of nations under a "law of peoples?" The new public philosopher might seek to understand labor law and military and trade theory and doctrine as much as theories of surplus value; the logic of international markets and trade agreements as much as critiques of commodification, and the politics of complexity as much as the politics of power (all of which can still be done from our arm chairs.) This means going down deep into the guts of our quotidian social institutions, into the grimy pragmatic details where intellectuals are loathe to dwell but where the officers and bureaucrats of those institutions take difficult and often unpleasant, imperfect decisions that affect other peoples' lives, and it means making honest attempts to truly understand how those institutions actually function in the actual world before howling for their overthrow commences. This might help keep us from being slapped down in debates by true policy pros who actually know what they are talking about but who lack awareness of the dogmatic assumptions from which they proceed, and who have not yet found a good reason to listen to jargon-riddled lectures from philosophers and culture critics with their snobish disrespect for the so-called "managerial class."</p><p>Extinction comes first <br/>Bok 88 (Sissela, Professor of Philosophy at Brandeis, Applied Ethics and Ethical Theory, Rosenthal and Shehadi, Ed.)</p><p>The same argument can be made for Kant’s other formulations of the Categorical Imperative: “So act as to use humanity, both in your own person and in the person of every other, always at the same time as an end, never simply as a means”; and “So act as if you were always through your actions a law-making member in a universal Kingdom of Ends.” &nbsp;No one with a concern for humanity could consistently will to risk eliminating humanity in the person of himself and every other or to risk the death of all members in a universal Kingdom of Ends for the sake of justice. To risk their collective death for the sake of following one’s conscience would be, as Rawls said, “irrational, crazy.” &nbsp;And to say that one did not intend such a catastrophe, but that one merely failed to stop other persons from bringing it about would be beside the point when the end of the world was at stake. &nbsp;For although it is true that we cannot be held responsible for most of the wrongs that others commit, the Latin maxim presents a case where we would have to take such responsibility seriously – perhaps to the point of deceiving, bribing, even killing an innocent person, in order that the world not perish. &nbsp;To avoid self-contradiction, the Categorical Imperative would, therefore, have to rule against the Latin maxim on account of its cavalier attitude toward the survival of mankind. &nbsp;But the ruling would then produce a rift in the application of the Categorical Imperative. &nbsp;Most often the Imperative would ask us to disregard all unintended but foreseeable consequences, such as the death of innocent persons, whenever concern for such consequences conflicts with concern for acting according to duty. &nbsp;But, in the extreme case, we might have to go against even the strictest moral duty precisely because of the consequences. &nbsp;Acknowledging such a rift would post a strong challenge to the unity and simplicity of Kant’s moral theory.&nbsp;</p><p>CONTENTION 3 IS IMPACT FRAMING</p><p>Nuclear war is obsolete: <br/>A.

A common definition picks out armed conflicts that cause at least 1,000 battle deaths in a year — soldiers and civilians killed by war violence, excluding the difficult-to-quantify indirect deaths resulting from hunger and disease. “Interstate wars” are those fought between national armies and have historically been the deadliest.<br/>These prototypical wars have become increasingly rare, and the world hasn’t seen one since the three-week invasion of Iraq in 2003. The lopsided five-day clash between Russia and Georgia in 2008 misses the threshold, as do sporadic clashes between North and South Korea or Thailand and Cambodia.<br/>Countries remain armed and hostile, so war is hardly impossible. But where would a new interstate war plausibly erupt? Robert Gates, the former secretary of defense, said this year that “any future defense secretary who advises the president to again send a big American land army into Asia or into the Middle East or Africa should have his head examined.”<br/>Chinese leaders would deserve a similar workup if they blew off the very basis of their legitimacy, namely trade-based prosperity, by starting a war. (China has not fought a battle in 23 years.) India and Pakistan came dangerously close to war in 2002, but they backed off when both sides realized that millions would die and have since stabilized relations. Neither North nor South Korea could win a war at an acceptable cost.<br/>What about other kinds of armed conflict, like civil wars and conflicts that miss the 1,000-death cutoff? Remarkably, they too have been in decline. Civil wars are fewer, smaller and more localized. Terrible flare-ups occur, and for those caught in the middle the results are devastating — but far fewer people are caught in the middle. The biggest continuing war, in Afghanistan, last year killed about 500 Americans, 100 other coalition troops and 5,000 Afghans including civilians. That toll, while deplorable, is a fraction of those in past wars like Vietnam, which killed 5,000 Americans and nearly 150,000 Vietnamese per year. Over all, the annual rate of battle deaths worldwide has fallen from almost 300 per 100,000 of world population during World War II, to almost 30 during Korea, to the low teens during Vietnam, to single digits in the late 1970s and 1980s, to fewer than 1 in the 21st century.<br/>As the political scientist John Mueller has pointed out, today’s civil wars are closer to organized crime than traditional war. Armed militias — really gangs of thugs — monopolize resources like cocaine in Colombia or coltan in Congo, or terrorize the locals into paying tribute to religious fanatics, as in Somalia, Nigeria and the Philippines.<br/>Nor has the suffering merely been displaced from soldiers to civilians. The much-quoted statistic that war deaths a century ago were 90 percent military and 10 percent civilian, while today the ratio is reversed, resulted from an error in a 1994 United Nations report that mistakenly compared deaths in World War I with refugees and wounded in the 1980s. The real ratio is around 50-50 and stable through time. Yes, atrocities against civilians continue, but consider a historical perspective. During World War II, Allied forces repeatedly and deliberately firebombed Axis cities, incinerating tens of thousands of civilians in a night. The Germans and Japanese did far worse. Today’s rapes, ethnic cleansings and suicide bombings are just as atrocious, but much smaller in scale.<br/>Why is war in decline? For one thing, it no longer pays. For centuries, wars reallocated huge territories, as empires were agglomerated or dismantled and states wiped off the map. But since shortly after World War II, virtually no borders have changed by force, and no member of the United Nations has disappeared through conquest. The Korean War caused a million battle deaths, but the border ended up where it started. The Iran-Iraq War killed 650,000 with the same result. Iraq’s annexation of Kuwait in 1990 backfired. Israel seized land in 1967, but since then most has been returned and the rest remains contested.<br/>The futility of conquest is part of the emergence of an international community regulated by norms and taboos and wielding more effective tools for managing conflicts. Among those tools, the United Nations’ 100,000 deployed peacekeepers have measurably improved the success of peace agreements in civil wars.<br/>War also declines as prosperity and trade rise.

The bomb may actually make us safer. In this era of rogue states and transnational terrorists, that idea sounds so obviously wrongheaded that few politicians or policymakers are willing to entertain it. But that's a mistake. Knowing the truth about nukes would have a profound impact on government policy. Obama's idealistic campaign, so out of character for a pragmatic administration, may be unlikely to get far (past presidents have tried and failed). But it's not even clear he should make the effort. There are more important measures the U.S. government can and should take to make the real world safer, and these mustn't be ignored in the name of a dreamy ideal (a nuke-free planet) that's both unrealistic and possibly undesirable. The argument that nuclear weapons can be agents of peace as well as destruction rests on two deceptively simple observations. First, nuclear weapons have not been used since 1945. Second, there's never been a nuclear, or even a nonnuclear, war between two states that possess them. Just stop for a second and think about that: it's hard to overstate how remarkable it is, especially given the singular viciousness of the 20th century. As Kenneth Waltz, the leading "nuclear optimist" and a professor emeritus of political science at UC Berkeley puts it, "We now have 64 years of experience since Hiroshima. It's striking and against all historical precedent that for that substantial period, there has not been any war among nuclear states." To understand why—and why the next 64 years are likely to play out the same way—you need to start by recognizing that all states are rational on some basic level. Their leaders may be stupid, petty, venal, even evil, but they tend to do things only when they're pretty sure they can get away with them. Take war: a country will start a fight only when it's almost certain it can get what it wants at an acceptable price. Not even Hitler or Saddam waged wars they didn't think they could win. The problem historically has been that leaders often make the wrong gamble and underestimate the other side—and millions of innocents pay the price. Nuclear weapons change all that by making the costs of war obvious, inevitable, and unacceptable. Suddenly, when both sides have the ability to turn the other to ashes with the push of a button—and everybody knows it—the basic math shifts. Even the craziest tin-pot dictator is forced to accept that war with a nuclear state is unwinnable and thus not worth the effort. As Waltz puts it, "Why fight if you can't win and might lose everything?" Why indeed? The iron logic of deterrence and mutually assured destruction is so compelling, it's led to what's known as the nuclear peace: the virtually unprecedented stretch since the end of World War II in which all the world's major powers have avoided coming to blows. They did fight proxy wars, ranging from Korea to Vietnam to Angola to Latin America. But these never matched the furious destruction of full-on, great-power war (World War II alone was responsible for some 50 million to 70 million deaths). And since the end of the Cold War, such bloodshed has declined precipitously. Meanwhile, the nuclear powers have scrupulously avoided direct combat, and there's very good reason to think they always will. There have been some near misses, but a close look at these cases is fundamentally reassuring—because in each instance, very different leaders all came to the same safe conclusion. Take the mother of all nuclear standoffs: the Cuban missile crisis. For 13 days in October 1962, the United States and the Soviet Union each threatened the other with destruction. But both countries soon stepped back from the brink when they recognized that a war would have meant curtains for everyone. As important as the fact that they did is the reason why: Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev's aide Fyodor Burlatsky said later on, "It is impossible to win a nuclear war, and both sides realized that, maybe for the first time." The record since then shows the same pattern repeating: nuclear-armed enemies slide toward war, then pull back, always for the same reasons. The best recent example is India and Pakistan, which fought three bloody wars after independence before acquiring their own nukes in 1998. Getting their hands on weapons of mass destruction didn't do anything to lessen their animosity. But it did dramatically mellow their behavior. Since acquiring atomic weapons, the two sides have never fought another war, despite severe provocations (like Pakistani-based terrorist attacks on India in 2001 and 2008). They have skirmished once. But during that flare-up, in Kashmir in 1999, both countries were careful to keep the fighting limited and to avoid threatening the other's vital interests. Sumit Ganguly, an Indiana University professor and coauthor of the forthcoming India, Pakistan, and the Bomb, has found that on both sides, officials' thinking was strikingly similar to that of the Russians and Americans in 1962. The prospect of war brought Delhi and Islamabad face to face with a nuclear holocaust, and leaders in each country did what they had to do to avoid it. Nuclear pessimists—and there are many—insist that even if this pattern has held in the past, it's crazy to rely on it in the future, for several reasons. The first is that today's nuclear wannabes are so completely unhinged, you'd be mad to trust them with a bomb. Take the sybaritic Kim Jong Il, who's never missed a chance to demonstrate his battiness, or Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who has denied the Holocaust and promised the destruction of Israel, and who, according to some respected Middle East scholars, runs a messianic martyrdom cult that would welcome nuclear obliteration. These regimes are the ultimate rogues, the thinking goes—and there's no deterring rogues. But are Kim and Ahmadinejad really scarier and crazier than were Stalin and Mao? It might look that way from Seoul or Tel Aviv, but history says otherwise. Khrushchev, remember, threatened to "bury" the United States, and in 1957, Mao blithely declared that a nuclear war with America wouldn't be so bad because even "if half of mankind died … the whole world would become socialist." Pyongyang and Tehran support terrorism—but so did Moscow and Beijing. And as for seeming suicidal, Michael Desch of the University of Notre Dame points out that Stalin and Mao are the real record holders here: both were responsible for the deaths of some 20 million of their own citizens. Yet when push came to shove, their regimes balked at nuclear suicide, and so would today's international bogeymen. For all of Ahmadinejad's antics, his power is limited, and the clerical regime has always proved rational and pragmatic when its life is on the line. Revolutionary Iran has never started a war, has done deals with both Washington and Jerusalem, and sued for peace in its war with Iraq (which Saddam started) once it realized it couldn't win. North Korea, meanwhile, is a tiny, impoverished, family-run country with a history of being invaded; its overwhelming preoccupation is survival, and every time it becomes more belligerent it reverses itself a few months later (witness last week, when Pyongyang told Seoul and Washington it was ready to return to the bargaining table). These countries may be brutally oppressive, but nothing in their behavior suggests they have a death wish.<br/>C. Climate change is the root cause of their impacts—it’s a threat multiplier<br/>Scheffran 9<br/>(Senior Research Scientist in the Program in Arms Control, Disarmament and International Security (ACDIS) of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Jurgen, “Climate-induced instabilities and conflicts,” &nbsp;IOP Conf. Ser.: Earth Environ. Sci. 6 56, dml)</p><p>The 2007 Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) analyzed a set of developments associated with climate change that could seriously undermine global living conditions. These include storm and flood disasters, reductions in water supplies, droughts, the degradation of ecosystems, the loss of biodiversity, and the spread of diseases. Most vulnerable are poor areas in high-risk regions and developing countries with low adaptive capacities; but wealthy countries are not immune (e.g., the 2003 European heat wave, Hurricane Katrina). These developments could lead to a number of human responses, including violent struggles for increasingly scarce resources, mass migrations, ethno-nationalism, and the erosion of legitimacy for existing institutions. The potential security risks posed by these climaterelated human responses are becoming increasingly worrisome to many observers. In 2007 the UN Security Council held its first discussion of the security risks of climate change and the UN Secretary General warned that climate change may pose as much of a danger as war. A 2007 report by a blue-ribbon panel of retired military leaders sees climate change as a “threat multiplier” in already fragile regions of the world, which could become breeding grounds for extremism and terrorism. Various scenarios of climate-related security threats were compiled by a panel of experts that included, among others, former CIA director James Woolsey and Nobel laureate Thomas Schelling. According to this panel’s report, climate change 'has the potential to be one of the greatest national security challenges that this or any other generation of policy makers is likely to confront.' It could breed new conflicts and magnify existing problems, from the desertification of Darfur and competition for water in the Middle East to the disruptive monsoons in Asia. The German Advisory Council on Global Change (WBGU) concludes in its 2007 report that, without resolute counteraction, climate change will overwhelm many societies’ adaptive capacities in the near future, resulting in a level of instability that could jeopardize national and international security. Since the early 1990s, several studies have examined how several climate-related factors affect violent conflict. This work suggests that environmental degradation and resource scarcity can contribute to violent conflict in a number of ways, including resource captures, mass migrations, and conflicts over compensation payments between countries. It also offers a typology of conflicts: center-periphery conflicts; ethno-ecological conflicts; regional, cross-border and mass-migration conflicts; international water conflicts, etc. These studies identify a set of contributing factors that join with environmental factors to affect the likelihood of violent conflict (e.g., institutional, socioeconomic, land use). These contributing factors are important because many of the studies do not show a clear link between environmental factors and interstate conflict.. When climate-related factors combine with these contributing factors, an indirect link emerges between environmental degradation, resource scarcities and domestic conflict. Despite these contributions a number of critiques argue that existing studies have done little more than confirm that the relationship between climate effects and conflict is complex and not well understood. The existing work makes it difficult to extrapolate the prospects for climate-induced instability into the future, document the factors that aggravate it, or identify the strategies that are effective in dealing with it. Part of the problem lies with the fact that many of findings are derived from case studies that already resulted in violent conflict. In order to address the deficiencies, this contribution will provide a rigorous examination of the climate-induced instability thesis that addresses the complexity of the problem: long-term climate changes will stress human, environmental and social subsystems in ways that will affect basic human needs and desires. Human responses will generate issues and disputes that could destabilize the functioning of core societal processes and institutions. The destabilizing effects of these reactions make it more difficult to produce goods and services, govern, and maintain civil social interaction; in addition, they can lead to violent conflict. For instance, increased temperatures and/or decreased precipitation may lead to water scarcity and soil degradation, which could lead to declines in agricultural yields and diminished food supplies. This could lead to increased competition for arable land and scarce food and water supplies – especially in poor nations with rapid population growth. Where poverty, disputes and other contributing factors co-exist, climaterelated stress could lead to the erosion of social order, economic decline, violent conflict, and governmental crises. This instability could also spread to neighboring states, through refugee flows or ethnic links, and expand the geographical scope of a crisis, overwhelming governance and security structures. These implications, however, are not inevitable: often climate-related stresses will be resolved effectively by institutions and other human interventions. Rather than conflict, more cooperation could be the result. This contribution discusses the climate-induced instability thesis within a conceptual framework of conflict and cooperation that draws from past experiences of weather and climate-related instability to enhance our ability to understand and deal with the future security threats posed by climate change. A macro-level analysis of environmental conflicts will be combined with micro-level empirical data of specific cases.<br/>And no miscalculation—threat of nuclear annihilation decreases margin for unpredictability<br/>Waltz 81<br/>(Kenneth Waltz, London International Institute for Strategic Studies, 1981, Adelphi Papers, Number 171, “The Spread of Nuclear Weapons: More May Better,” <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/waltz1.htm  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed using an unsupported protocol (e.g., gopher).  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/waltz1.htm%27" tppabs="https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/waltz1.htm"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/waltz1.htm</span></a></span>, Accessed 11/23/13, JC)</p><p>Uncertainty about outcomes does not work decisively against the fighting of wars in con¬ventional worlds. Countries armed with con¬ventional weapons go to war knowing that even in defeat their suffering will be limited. Calculations about nuclear war are differently made. Nuclear worlds call for and encourage a different kind of reasoning. If countries armed with nuclear weapons go to war, they do so knowing that their suffering may be unlimited. Of course, it also may not be. But that is not the kind of uncertainty that encourages anyone to use force. In a conventional world, one is uncertain about winning or losing. In a nuclear world, one is uncertain about surviving or being annihilated. If force is used and not kept within limits, catastrophe will result. That prediction is easy to make because it does not require close estimates of opposing forces. The number of one's cities that can be severely damaged is at least equal to the number of strategic warheads an adversary can deliver. Variations of number mean little within wide ranges. The expected effect of the deterrent achieves an easy clarity because wide margins of error in estimates of probable damage do not matter. Do we expect to lose one city or two, two cities or ten? When these are the pertinent questions, we stop thinking about running risks and start worrying about how to avoid them. In a conventional world, deterrent threats are ineffective because the damage threatened is distant, limited, and problematic. Nuclear weapons make military miscalcu¬lations difficult and politically pertinent pre¬diction easy.<br/>Nuclear war doesn’t cause extinction: <br/>A. Nuclear Winter Theory Flawed<br/>Ball, Professor at the Strategic and Defence Studies Centre at the Australian National University, 2006<br/>(Desmond, May 2006, Strategic and Defense Studies Center, “The Probabilities of On the Beach: Assessing ‘Armageddon Scenarios’ in the 21st Century,” working paper, p. 4, EB)<br/>The leading populariser of the ‘Nuclear Winter’ hypothesis was Carl Sagan, the brilliant planetary scientist and humanist. He had noticed in 1971, when Mariner 1 was examining Mars, that the planet was subject to global dust storms which markedly affected the atmospheric and surface temperatures. Large amounts of dust in the upper atmosphere absorbed sunlight, heating the atmosphere but cooling the surface, spreading ‘cold and darkness’ over the planet. He recognised that wholesale ground-bursts of nuclear weapons and the incineration of hundreds of cities could produce sufficient dust and smoke to cause a similar effect on the Earth. Sagan even postulated the existence of some threshold level— around 100 million tonnes of smoke—for production of ‘Nuclear Winter’.7 I argued vigorously with Sagan about the ‘Nuclear Winter’ hypothesis, both in lengthy correspondence and, in August-September 1985, when I was a guest in the lovely house he and Ann Druyan had overlooking Ithaca in up-state New York. I argued that, with more realistic data about the operational characteristics of the respective US and Soviet force configurations (such as bomber delivery profiles, impact footprints of MIRVed warheads) and more plausible exchange scenarios, it was impossible to generate anywhere near the postulated levels of smoke. The megatonnage expended on cities (economic/industrial targets) was more likely to be around 140-650 than over 1,000; the amount of smoke generated would have ranged from around 18 million tonnes to perhaps 80 million tonnes. In the case of counter-force scenarios, most missile forces were (and still are) located in either ploughed fields or tundra and, even where they are generally located in forested or grassed areas, very few of the actual missile silos are less than several kilometres from combustible material. A target-by-target analysis of the actual locations of the strategic nuclear forces in the United States and the Soviet Union showed that the actual amount of smoke produced even by a 4,000 megaton counter-force scenario would range from only 300 tonnes (if the exchange occurred in January) to 2,000 tonnes (for an exchange in July)—the worst case being a factor of 40 smaller than that postulated by the ‘Nuclear Winter’ theorists. I thought that it was just as wrong to overestimate the possible consequences of nuclear war, and to raise the spectre of extermination of human life as a serious likelihood, as to underestimate them (e.g., by omitting fallout casualties). The current US-Russian nuclear forces The sizes of the US and Russian nuclear stockpiles have declined substantially since the end of the Cold War. They now have only about 20 percent of the peak number of around 70,000 in 1986, when the Soviet Union had about 45,000 and the United States about 24,000 (down from a peak of 32,500 in 1967), of which 33,800 and 10,550 respectively were classed as tactical or ‘theatre’ weapons and 11,200 and 13,450 as strategic. Most of the tactical and theatre weapons have been dismantled and the numbers of strategic weapons halved.<br/>B. No Impact to Fallout<br/>Martin, research associate in the Dept. of Mathematics at Australian National University, 1984<br/>(Brian, May 1984, Scientists Against Nuclear Arms Newsletter, “Extinction politics,” number 16, p. 5-6, EB)<br/>The promotion of beliefs in massive death and destruction from war has been an important facet of the efforts of many peace movements. In the 1930s, British military planners estimated the effects of aerial bombardment by extrapolating linearly from the very limited experience of bombardments and casualties in World War I. On the basis of such assumptions, people such as Philip Noel Baker in the 1930s predicted the obliteration of civilization from war. But the experience of World War II showed that the 1930s military expectations of casualties per tonne of bombs were sizeable overestimates.1 By the 1950s, a large number of people had come to believe that the killing of much or all of the world's population would result from global nuclear war. This idea was promoted by the peace movement, among which the idea of 'overkill' - in the sense that nuclear arsenals could kill everyone on earth several times over - became an article of faith. Yet in spite of the widespread belief in nuclear extinction, there was almost no scientific support for such a possibility. The scenario of the book and movie On the Beach,2 with fallout clouds gradually enveloping the earth and wiping out all life, was and is fiction. The scientific evidence is that fallout would only kill people who are immediately downwind of surface nuclear explosions and who are heavily exposed during the first few days. Global fallout has no potential for causing massive immediate death (though it could cause up to millions of cancers worldwide over many decades).3 In spite of the lack of evidence, large sections of the peace movement have left unaddressed the question of whether nuclear war inevitably means global extinction. The next effect to which beliefs in nuclear extinction were attached was ozone depletion. Beginning in the mid-1970s, scares about stratospheric ozone developed, culminating in 1982 in the release of Jonathan Schell's book The Fate of the Earth.4 Schell painted a picture of human annihilation from nuclear war based almost entirely on effects from increased ultraviolet light at the earth's surface due to ozone reductions caused by nuclear explosions. Schell's book was greeted with adulation rarely observed in any field. Yet by the time the book was published, the scientific basis for ozone-based nuclear extinction had almost entirely evaporated. The ongoing switch by the military forces of the United States and the Soviet Union from multi-megatonne nuclear weapons to larger numbers of smaller weapons means that the effect on ozone from even the largest nuclear war is unlikely to lead to any major effect on human population levels, and extinction from ozone reductions is virtually out of the question.3 The latest stimulus for doomsday beliefs is 'nuclear winter': the blocking of sunlight from dust raised by nuclear explosions and smoke from fires ignited by nuclear attacks. This would result in a few months of darkness and lowered temperatures, mainly in the northern mid-latitudes.5 The effects could be quite significant, perhaps causing the deaths of up to several hundred million more people than would die from the immediate effects of blast, heat and radiation. But the evidence, so far, seems to provide little basis for beliefs in nuclear extinction. The impact of nuclear winter on populations nearer the equator, such as in India, does not seem likely to be significant. The most serious possibilities would result from major ecological destruction, but this remains speculative at present. As in the previous doomsday scenarios, antiwar scientists and peace movements have taken up the crusading torch of extinction politics. Few doubts have been voiced about the evidence about nuclear winter or the politics of promoting beliefs in nuclear extinction. Opponents of war, including scientists, have often exaggerated the effects of nuclear war and emphasized worst cases. Schell continually bends evidence to give the worst impression. For example, he implies that a nuclear attack is inevitably followed by a firestorm or conflagration. He invariably gives the maximum time for people having to remain in shelters from fallout. And he takes a pessimistic view of the potential for ecological resilience to radiation exposure and for human resourcefulness in a crisis. Similarly, in several of the scientific studies of nuclear winter, I have noticed a strong tendency to focus on worst cases and to avoid examination of ways to overcome the effects. For example, no one seems to have looked at possibilities for migration to coastal areas away from the freezing continental temperatures or looked at people changing their diets away from grain-fed beef to direct consumption of the grain, thereby greatly extending reserves of food.</p></div></div></td><td>1/4/14</td></tr><tr><td style="width:100%; word-break:break-all; word-break:break-word;"><div><p><input onclick="saveEntry(1)" src="../../xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" tppabs="http://hspolicy13.debatecoaches.org/xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" style="float:right;" title="Save" type="image" value="Save"></input>

Its seeds contain high amounts of oil that can be processed to produce a high- quality energy feedstock for use in biodiesel, renewable jet fuel or specialty products. Because it is a non-edible feedstock and can be effectively harvested on abandoned land that is considered undesirable for food crops, it does not compete with global food supplies.<br/>Most early investments in Jatropha as a row crop focused on planting cultivars that had not gone through any genetic improvement program. Early growers of Jatropha were disappointed in yields and many early plantations failed, because little attention was made to proper germplasm selection, agronomic best practices or the establishment of a complete value chain.<br/>Today, a new era of Jatropha has emerged that is realizing the economic and environmental potential of the renewable energy crop.

The lopsided five-day clash between Russia and Georgia in 2008 misses the threshold, as do sporadic clashes between North and South Korea or Thailand and Cambodia.<br/>Countries remain armed and hostile, so war is hardly impossible. But where would a new interstate war plausibly erupt? Robert Gates, the former secretary of defense, said this year that "any future defense secretary who advises the president to again send a big American land army into Asia or into the Middle East or Africa should have his head examined."<br/>Chinese leaders would deserve a similar workup if they blew off the very basis of their legitimacy, namely trade-based prosperity, by starting a war. (China has not fought a battle in 23 years.) India and Pakistan came dangerously close to war in 2002, but they backed off when both sides realized that millions would die and have since stabilized relations. Neither North nor South Korea could win a war at an acceptable cost.<br/>What about other kinds of armed conflict, like civil wars and conflicts that miss <br/>AND<br/>late 1970s and 1980s, to fewer than 1 in the 21st century.<br/>As the political scientist John Mueller has pointed out, today’s civil wars are closer to organized crime than traditional war. Armed militias — really gangs of thugs — monopolize resources like cocaine in Colombia or coltan in Congo, or terrorize the locals into paying tribute to religious fanatics, as in Somalia, Nigeria and the Philippines.<br/>Nor has the suffering merely been displaced from soldiers to civilians. The much-<br/>AND<br/>and suicide bombings are just as atrocious, but much smaller in scale.<br/>Why is war in decline? For one thing, it no longer pays. <br/>AND<br/>, but since then most has been returned and the rest remains contested.<br/>The futility of conquest is part of the emergence of an international community regulated by norms and taboos and wielding more effective tools for managing conflicts. Among those tools, the United Nations’ 100,000 deployed peacekeepers have measurably improved the success of peace agreements in civil wars.<br/>War also declines as prosperity and trade rise. Historically, wealth came from land and conquest was profitable. Today, wealth comes from trade, and war only hurts. When leaders’ power depends on delivering economic growth, and when a country’s government becomes richer and stronger than its warlords, war loses its appeal.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HB.Nuclearweaponsdeterallwar2013empiricsprove" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>B.
