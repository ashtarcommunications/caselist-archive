Israel cites biblical and historical links to the territory.<br/>Kerry, whose shuttle diplomacy helped to revive the talks, has set a nine-month schedule for an agreement, despite widespread skepticism.<br/>"I remain absolutely committed to this ability to get a final status (agreement)," Kerry said at a news conference in Amman, repeatedly warning of "prolonged, continued conflict", violence and confrontation if the talks failed.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HPlanshiftsKerry2019sfocus." class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Plan shifts Kerry’s focus.</span></h4><p>Anderson and Grewell 2k, (Terry L., Executive Director of the Property and Environment Research Center, J.

Although Palestine itself would obviously be non-nuclear, its overall strategic impact could nonetheless be magnified by continuously unfolding and more-or-less unpredictable developments in Egypt, Syria, Libya, Lebanon and elsewhere in this roiling and chaotic area.<br/>A nuclear war could arrive in Israel not only as a "bolt-from<br/>AND<br/>reprisals might be met, in the future, with enemy nuclear counterstrikes.<br/>For now, this would become possible only if a still-nuclearizing Iran were <br/>AND<br/>the first place, could reduce Israel’s escalatory exposure to a nuclear war.<br/>Pertinent questions arise. With its implicit ("deliberately ambiguous") nuclear capacities, why should Israel need a conventional deterrent at all? After all, even after Palestinian statehood, wouldn’t all rational enemy states desist from launching any conventional or biological attacks upon Israel out of an entirely sensible fear of Israeli nuclear retaliation? <br/>Not necessarily. Aware that Israel would cross the nuclear threshold only in very extraordinary circumstances, these enemy states could be convinced – rightly or wrongly – that as long as their attacks remained recognizably non-nuclear, Israel would always respond in kind.<br/>The only credible way for Israel to deter large-scale conventional attacks after the <br/>AND<br/>were undertaken, lead quickly via escalation to various forms of unconventional war. <br/>However unforeseen, Palestine, already a "nonmember observer state" at the United Nations, would have measurably corrosive effects on power and peace in the Middle East. As, by definition, the creation of this particular Arab state would come at the territorial expense of Israel, the Jewish state’s strategic depth would promptly and irretrievably diminish. Over time, Israel’s conventional capacity to ward off enemy attacks could be commensurately reduced. <br/>If certain enemy states were to perceive Israel’s own sense of expanding weakness and possible <br/>AND<br/>prove calamitous for the "winner," as well as the "loser."<br/>To be sure, a meaningful risk of regional nuclear war in the Middle East exists independently of any Palestinian state. Still, this unprecedented risk would be further enlarged if a 23rd Arab state were to appear more-or-less simultaneously with Iranian nuclear weapons. Above anything else, Israel must now do what is needed to prevent such coinciding and mutually-reinforcing and existential perils.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HText:TheUnitedStatesfederalgovernmentshouldnormalizeitstraderelationswithCubaifandonlyifthegovernmentsofamajorityofLatinAmericannationscommitto:" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Text: The United States federal government should normalize its trade relations with Cuba if and only if the governments of a majority of Latin American nations commit to:</span></h4><h4 id="H2014activelyseekinganormalizationprocessbetweentheUnitedStatesandCuba2Cand" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>—actively seeking a normalization process between the United States and Cuba, and</span></h4><h4 id="H2014compellingtheCubangovernmenttoworktowardsestablishingrepresentativedemocracyandbetterrespectforhumanrights." class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>—compelling the Cuban government to work towards establishing representative democracy and better respect for human rights.</span></h4><p>&nbsp;</p><h4 id="HCounterplansolvesthecase2014LatinAmericangovernmentswillsayyes" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Counterplan solves the case—Latin American governments will say yes</span></h4><p>Castañeda 9 - Jorge G.

And if he insists on political change as a precondition for lifting the embargo, Mr. Obama would be pursuing the policy that his last 10 predecessors have fruitlessly followed.<br/>There might be a way to square the circle. It begins with a unilateral end to the embargo: Nothing is expected from Cuba. But in exchange for eliminating the embargo, key Latin American players would be expected to commit to actively seeking a normalization process between Washington and Havana, and to forcing Cuba to establish representative democracy and respect for human rights.<br/>As democrats who experienced authoritarian rule and sought international support in their struggle against it<br/>AND<br/>leaders toward a principled stance, Mr. Obama would turn the tables.<br/>This policy would give the Cubans what they say they want: an unconditional end <br/>AND<br/>as a demand from Cuba’s friends — not as an imposition from Washington.<br/>Mr. Obama would look great, since U.S. policy would shift in exchange for Latin leaders’ dedication to principles like democracy and human rights that he and they espouse. A clear commitment from Latin leaders to a normalization that would not follow the Vietnamese course (economic reform with no political change) would be a major foreign policy victory for Mr. Obama.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HUnilaterallycooperatingwithCubadestroysLatinAmericandemocracy." class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Unilaterally cooperating with Cuba destroys Latin American democracy.</span></h4><p>Castañeda 8 - Jorge G.

And if he insists on political change as a precondition for lifting the embargo, Mr. Obama would be pursuing the policy that his last 10 predecessors have fruitlessly followed.<br/>There might be a way to square the circle. It begins with a unilateral end to the embargo: Nothing is expected from Cuba. But in exchange for eliminating the embargo, key Latin American players would be expected to commit to actively seeking a normalization process between Washington and Havana, and to forcing Cuba to establish representative democracy and respect for human rights.<br/>As democrats who experienced authoritarian rule and sought international support in their struggle against it<br/>AND<br/>leaders toward a principled stance, Mr. Obama would turn the tables.<br/>This policy would give the Cubans what they say they want: an unconditional end <br/>AND<br/>as a demand from Cuba’s friends — not as an imposition from Washington.<br/>Mr. Obama would look great, since U.S. policy would shift in exchange for Latin leaders’ dedication to principles like democracy and human rights that he and they espouse.

It is important to note, again, that the most severe effects of climate change are likely to be felt in the future, and the future is inherently uncertain.4 While fundamental shifts in the environment are not inconceivable, our best bet for predicting what is to come is to look at what has transpired in the past. Since it is frequently argued that climate change will lead to resource scarcities and exacerbate inequality, it is possible to draw upon past evidence regarding these factors to develop a sense of how conflicts might unfold given changes in the Earth’s atmosphere. Additionally, I do not take issue with the claim that climate change will present considerable challenges for human societies and ecosystems more generally. Humanitarian crises stemming, in part, from climate change have the potential to be severe, and steps must be taken quickly to attenuate such contingencies. Rather, my purpose here is to underscore the point that environmental processes, by themselves, cannot explain why, where, and when fighting will occur; rather, the interaction between environmental and political systems is critical for understanding organized armed violence. First, the deterministic view has poor predictive power as to where and when conflicts will break out. For every potential example of an environmental catastrophe or resource shortfall that leads to violence, there are many more counter-examples in which conflict never occurs. But popular accounts typically do not look at the dogs that do not bark. Darfur is frequently cited as a case where desertification led to food scarcity, water scarcity, and famine, in turn leading to civil war and ethnic cleansing.5 Yet, food scarcity and hunger are problems endemic to many countries – particularly in sub-Saharan Africa – but similar problems elsewhere have not led to large-scale violence. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, food shortages and malnutrition affect more than a third of the population in Malawi, Zambia, the Comoros, North Korea, and Tanzania,6 although none of these countries have experienced fullblown civil war and state failure. Hurricanes, coastal flooding, and droughts – which are all likely to intensify as the climate warms – are frequent occurrences which rarely lead to violence. The Asian Tsunami of 2004, although caused by an oceanic earthquake, led to severe loss of life and property, flooding, population displacement, and resource scarcity, but it did not trigger new wars in Southeast Asia. Large-scale migration has the potential to provoke conflict in receiving areas (see Reuveny, 2007; Salehyan 26 Gleditsch, 2006), yet most migration flows do not lead to conflict, and, in this regard, social integration and citizenship policies are particularly important (Gleditsch, Nordås 26 Salehyan, 2007). In short, resource scarcity, natural disasters, and long-term climatic shifts are ubiquitous, while armed conflict is rare; therefore, environmental conditions, by themselves, cannot predict violent outbreaks. Second, even if local skirmishes over access to resources arise, these do not always escalate to open warfare and state collapse. While interpersonal violence is more or less common and may intensify under resource pressures, sustained armed conflict on a massive scale is difficult to conduct. Meier, Bond 26 Bond (2007) show that, under certain circumstances, environmental conditions have led to cattle raiding among pastoralists in East Africa, but these conflicts rarely escalate to sustained violence. Martin (2005) presents evidence from Ethiopia that, while a large refugee influx and population pressures led to localized conflict over natural resources, effective resource management regimes were able to ameliorate these tensions. Both of these studies emphasize the role of local dispute-resolution regimes and institutions – not just the response of central governments – in preventing resource conflicts from spinning out of control. Martin’s analysis also points to the importance of international organizations, notably the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, in implementing effective policies governing refugee camps. Therefore, local hostilities need not escalate to serious armed conflict and can be</span></h4><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HCan2019tsolveCubansugarethanol.-1" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Can’t solve Cuban sugar ethanol.</span></h4><p>Sanchez ’11<br/>Adriana E.

Israel cites biblical and historical links to the territory.<br/>Kerry, whose shuttle diplomacy helped to revive the talks, has set a nine-month schedule for an agreement, despite widespread skepticism.<br/>"I remain absolutely committed to this ability to get a final status (agreement)," Kerry said at a news conference in Amman, repeatedly warning of "prolonged, continued conflict", violence and confrontation if the talks failed.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HPlanshiftsKerry2019sfocus.-1" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Plan shifts Kerry’s focus.</span></h4><p>Anderson and Grewell 2k, (Terry L., Executive Director of the Property and Environment Research Center, J.

Although Palestine itself would obviously be non-nuclear, its overall strategic impact could nonetheless be magnified by continuously unfolding and more-or-less unpredictable developments in Egypt, Syria, Libya, Lebanon and elsewhere in this roiling and chaotic area.<br/>A nuclear war could arrive in Israel not only as a "bolt-from<br/>AND<br/>reprisals might be met, in the future, with enemy nuclear counterstrikes.<br/>For now, this would become possible only if a still-nuclearizing Iran were <br/>AND<br/>the first place, could reduce Israel’s escalatory exposure to a nuclear war.<br/>Pertinent questions arise. With its implicit ("deliberately ambiguous") nuclear capacities, why should Israel need a conventional deterrent at all? After all, even after Palestinian statehood, wouldn’t all rational enemy states desist from launching any conventional or biological attacks upon Israel out of an entirely sensible fear of Israeli nuclear retaliation? <br/>Not necessarily. Aware that Israel would cross the nuclear threshold only in very extraordinary circumstances, these enemy states could be convinced – rightly or wrongly – that as long as their attacks remained recognizably non-nuclear, Israel would always respond in kind.<br/>The only credible way for Israel to deter large-scale conventional attacks after the <br/>AND<br/>were undertaken, lead quickly via escalation to various forms of unconventional war. <br/>However unforeseen, Palestine, already a "nonmember observer state" at the United Nations, would have measurably corrosive effects on power and peace in the Middle East. As, by definition, the creation of this particular Arab state would come at the territorial expense of Israel, the Jewish state’s strategic depth would promptly and irretrievably diminish. Over time, Israel’s conventional capacity to ward off enemy attacks could be commensurately reduced. <br/>If certain enemy states were to perceive Israel’s own sense of expanding weakness and possible <br/>AND<br/>prove calamitous for the "winner," as well as the "loser."<br/>To be sure, a meaningful risk of regional nuclear war in the Middle East exists independently of any Palestinian state. Still, this unprecedented risk would be further enlarged if a 23rd Arab state were to appear more-or-less simultaneously with Iranian nuclear weapons. Above anything else, Israel must now do what is needed to prevent such coinciding and mutually-reinforcing and existential perils.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HText:TheUnitedStatesfederalgovernmentshouldnormalizeitstraderelationswithCubaifandonlyifthegovernmentsofamajorityofLatinAmericannationscommitto:-1" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Text: The United States federal government should normalize its trade relations with Cuba if and only if the governments of a majority of Latin American nations commit to:</span></h4><h4 id="H2014activelyseekinganormalizationprocessbetweentheUnitedStatesandCuba2Cand-2" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>—actively seeking a normalization process between the United States and Cuba, and</span></h4><h4 id="H2014compellingtheCubangovernmenttoworktowardsestablishingrepresentativedemocracyandbetterrespectforhumanrights.-2" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>—compelling the Cuban government to work towards establishing representative democracy and better respect for human rights.</span></h4><p>&nbsp;</p><h4 id="HCounterplansolvesthecase2014LatinAmericangovernmentswillsayyes-1" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Counterplan solves the case—Latin American governments will say yes</span></h4><p>Castañeda 9 - Jorge G.

But in exchange for eliminating the embargo, key Latin American players would be expected to commit to actively seeking a normalization process between Washington and Havana, and to forcing Cuba to establish representative democracy and respect for human rights.<br/>As democrats who experienced authoritarian rule and sought international support in their struggle against it<br/>AND<br/>leaders toward a principled stance, Mr. Obama would turn the tables.<br/>This policy would give the Cubans what they say they want: an unconditional end <br/>AND<br/>as a demand from Cuba’s friends — not as an imposition from Washington.<br/>Mr. Obama would look great, since U.S. policy would shift in exchange for Latin leaders’ dedication to principles like democracy and human rights that he and they espouse. A clear commitment from Latin leaders to a normalization that would not follow the Vietnamese course (economic reform with no political change) would be a major foreign policy victory for Mr. Obama.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HUnilaterallycooperatingwithCubadestroysLatinAmericandemocracy.-1" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Unilaterally cooperating with Cuba destroys Latin American democracy.</span></h4><p>Castañeda 8 - Jorge G.

Raúl Castro represent a genuine political opening toward greater freedom.<br/>If anything, things are getting worse. The report, which covers 2012, says the independent Cuban Commission on Human Rights and Reconciliation counted 6,602 short-term detentions during the year, compared with 4,123 in 2011. In March 2012, the same commission recorded a 30-year record high of 1,158 short-term detentions in a single month just before the visit of Pope Benedict XVI.<br/>Among the many abuses cited by the 2012 report are the prison sentences handed out to members of the Unión Patriotica de Cuba, the estimated 3,000 citizens held under the charge of "potential dangerousness," state-orchestrated assaults against the Damas de Blanco (Ladies in White), the suspicious death of dissident Oswaldo Payá and so on.<br/>As in any dictatorship, telling the truth is a crime: Independent journalist Calixto Ramón Martínez Arias, the first to report on the cholera outbreak in Cuba, was jailed in September for the crime of desacato (insulting speech) and remained there until last week.<br/>The regime is willing to undertake some meek economic reforms to keep people employed. It has even dared to relax its travel requirements to allow more Cubans to leave the country if they can get a passport. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>Both of these are short-term survival measures, designed as escape valves for growing internal pressure. But when it comes to free speech, political activity and freedom of association — the building blocks of a free society — the report is a depressing chronicle of human-rights abuses and a valuable reminder that repression is the Castro regime’s only response to those who demand a genuinely free Cuba.

If we both want the <br/>AND<br/>rage. Thus ethics identifies the rights of individuals when their interests conflict.<br/>But how can a case for shunning be made on this view of morality? <br/>AND<br/>, on what grounds might it be a duty to impose such sanctions?<br/>We find the answer when we note that there is another "level" of <br/>AND<br/>rights of others with one’s actions but also to support that moral order.<br/>Consider that the moral order itself contributes significantly to people’s rights being respected. It <br/>AND<br/>it indirectly affects people’s rights. And this is where shunning fits in.<br/>Certain types of behavior constitute a direct attack on the moral order. When the <br/>AND<br/>three conditions which turn immoral behavior into an attack on the moral order.<br/>An immoral action is flagrant if it is "extremely or deliberately conspicuous; notorious<br/>AND<br/>reaffirms the legitimacy of that moral order. How does shunning do this?<br/>First, by refusing publicly to have to do with such a person one announces support for the moral order and backs up the announcement with action. This action reinforces the commitment to the moral order both of the shunner and of the other members of the community. (Secretary of State Shultz in effect made this argument in his call for international sanctions on Libya in the early days of 1986.)<br/>Further, shunning may have a moral effect on the shunned person, even if the direct impact is not adequate to change the immoral behavior. If the shunned person thinks of herself as part of the moral community, shunning may well make clear to her that she is, in fact, removing herself from that community by the behavior in question. Thus shunning may achieve by moral suasion what cannot be achieved by "force."<br/>Finally, shunning may be a form of punishment, of moral sanction, whose appropriateness depends not on whether it will change the person’s behavior, but on whether he deserves the punishment for violating the moral order. Punishment then can be viewed as a way of maintaining the moral order, of "purifying the community" after it has been made "unclean," as ancient communities might have put it.<br/>Yet not every immoral action requires that we shun. As noted above, we <br/>AND<br/>on the moral order itself through flagrant, willful, and persistent wrongdoing. <br/>We can also now see why failure to shun can under certain circumstances suggest complicity. But it is not that we have a duty to shun because failure to do so suggests complicity. Rather, because we have an obligation to shun in certain circumstances, when we fail to do so others may interpret our failure as tacit complicity in the willful, persistent, and flagrant immorality.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HNofoodwars2Candtheydon2019tescalate.-2" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>No food wars, and they don’t escalate.</span></h4><p><strong>Salehyan 08</strong> (Idean, Prof. Pol.

There is always a very important stage, geological studies, where investigators estimate the potential for the existence of hydrocarbons.<br/>That is the process we have conducted for the past 10 years in Cuba, which includes a study by the U.S. Geological Survey. This study, done for the first time in 2004, estimates that in Cuba’s geological north strip, off shore, from Pinar del Río Province to northern Matanzas province, there are oil reserves.<br/>The surveyors raise the possibility that from 4 billion to 6 billion barrels of crude are still to be found. These geological studies are very environmental, but historically they are highly trusted by our industry. That doesn’t mean that they guarantee the amount of oil, but it’s the first step in that stage.<br/>The chances of finding oil; challenges to the effort<br/>Finding oil in Cuba would not be a major problem from a technical point of view. Today, there is a technology to bring offshore oil to dry land, where it can be refined or carried in tankers to other markets.<br/>Another issue is related with our model of consumption. If we found oil in Cuba, the mere news would lead us to think, "Goody, now I can turn on all the lights, do all that, and now I don’t care." Conversely, if we find oil, we must adhere to the concept of savings, recycling, using public transportation.<br/>Reaching maximum production would take from three to five years. Each field could have 5, 10, 15 or 20 wells that could reach an adequate production. Neither I nor the people with whom I’ve talked believe that Cuba’s potential in deep waters will exceed 200,000 or 300,000 barrels per day.<br/>Eventually, if we find what we hope for, within five to seven years, Cuba could produce 250,000 barrels per day.</p><h4 id="HOilindependencedeterioratesUS-Saudities-1" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Oil independence deteriorates US-Saudi ties</span></h4><p>Tanter ’12<br/>~RAYMOND TANTER, Professor Emeritus, University of Michigan; President of Iran Policy Committee Publishing; and former member of the National Security Council staff in the Reagan-Bush Administration, "The Geopolitics of U.S. Energy Independence," International Economy, Summer 2012, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.international-economy.com/TIE_Su12_GeopoliticsEnergySymp.pdf~~  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.international-economy.com/TIE_Su12_GeopoliticsEnergySymp.pdf~~%27" tppabs="http://www.international-economy.com/TIE_Su12_GeopoliticsEnergySymp.pdf~~"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.international-economy.com/TIE_Su12_GeopoliticsEnergySymp.pdf~~</span></a></span></p><p>At issue is whether energy independence will cause¶ a revision of U.S<br/>AND<br/>like an Iranian nuclear weapon could wipe¶ out the tide toward isolationism.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HUS-Saudiinteractionisfullydependentonoil2013theplanremovesthatlink-1" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>US-Saudi interaction is fully dependent on oil – the plan removes that link</span></h4><p>Congregalli ’13<br/>~Matteo Congregalli, International Politics Journalist, "Without Oil.

The most potent challenge to America’s dominance comes not from the continuing redistribution of global power, but from a subtler change: the new forms of governance and capitalism being forged by China and other rising nations.<br/>The democratic, secular and free-market model that has become synonymous with the <br/>AND<br/>their own versions of modernity and pushing back against the West’s ideological ambitions.<br/>As this century unfolds, sustaining American power will be the easy part. The hard part will be adjusting to the loss of America’s ideological dominance and fashioning consensus and compromise in an increasingly diverse and unwieldy world.<br/>If American leaders remain blind to this new reality and continue to expect conformity to Western values, they will not only misunderstand emerging powers, but also alienate the many countries tired of being herded toward Western standards of governance.<br/>This transition won’t be easy. Since the founding era, the American elite and <br/>AND<br/>economic and political wherewithal to consolidate brands of modernity that present durable alternatives.<br/>The last 30 years of Chinese development, for example, look nothing like the <br/>AND<br/>competitors, enriching its bourgeoisie and lifting hundreds of millions out of poverty.<br/>And in today’s fast and fluid global economy, the control afforded by state capitalism has its distinct advantages, which is precisely why Russia, Vietnam and others are following China’s lead.<br/>The Middle East is similarly set to confound American expectations. Participatory politics may be <br/>AND<br/>one of the main reasons Islamists recently prevailed in the country’s parliamentary elections.<br/>And Egypt is the rule, not the exception. If nothing else, the Arab Spring has shown that democratization does not equal Westernization, and that it is past time for Washington to rethink its longstanding alignment with the region’s secular parties.<br/>True, rising powers like India and Brazil are stable, secular democracies that appear to be hewing closely to the Western model. But these countries have democratized while their populations consist mainly of the urban and rural poor, not the middle class. As a result, both nations have embraced a left-wing populism wary of free markets and of representative institutions that seem to deliver benefits only to a privileged elite.<br/>¶ Rising democracies are also following their own paths on foreign policy, foiling America’s <br/>AND<br/>with Washington less than 25 percent of the time at the United Nations.<br/>¶ Washington has long presumed that the world’s democracies will as a matter of course ally themselves with the United States; common values supposedly mean common interests. But if India and Brazil are any indication, even rising powers that are stable democracies will chart their own courses, expediting the arrival of a world that no longer plays by Western rules.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HWeneedtocontinuepromotingdemocracy." class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>We need to continue promoting democracy.</span></h4><p>Kupchan 12, Charles, Professor of international relations at Georgetown and a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, 4/7, "America’s Place in the New World," The New York Times, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/08/opinion/sunday/americas-place-in-the-new-world.html?pagewanted=126_r=0)//DR.  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/08/opinion/sunday/americas-place-in-the-new-world.html?pagewanted=126_r=0)//DR.%27" tppabs="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/08/opinion/sunday/americas-place-in-the-new-world.html?pagewanted=126_r=0)//DR."><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/08/opinion/sunday/americas-place-in-the-new-world.html?pagewanted=126_r=0)//DR.</span></a></span> H</p><p>¶ To be sure, even as it adopts a more pluralistic approach, the United States should defend not just its interests, but also its values.

This action is a stimulant used to mask real pain with surplus enjoyment, creating charred men where we feel but are not alive. <br/>Zupancic 03 alenka, “The Shortest Shadow: Nietzsche’s Philosophy of the Two,” 47-49</p><p>It might seem that the notion of the ascetic ideal, as well as Nietzsche’s analysis and criticism of it, somehow belongs to the past, and has no particular relevance to our largely hedonistic “postmodern condition.” Yet this assumption could not be more erroneous. The hedonism of postmodern society, far from representing a step out of the framework of what Nietzsche calls the ascetic ideal, is deeply rooted in this framework. In order to see this, we must first understand that, for Nietzsche, the asceticism involved in the ascetic ideal does not simply involve a renouncement of enjoyment; it involves, above all, a specific mode or articulation of enjoyment. Moreover, one could even say that the ascetic ideal coincides with the very “invention” of enjoyment: enjoyment as different from pleasure, as something which lies—to use Freud’s term—beyond the pleasure principle. If, according to Nietzsche, all great religions are an answer to man’s feelings of displeasure and pain, they never treat the cause of this displeasure. Instead, they soothe the sensation of displeasure— they soothe it by providing an even stronger sensation. They literally “outscream” the displeasure (and the “depression”—this is Nietzsche‘s term—linked to it) with an even sharper and more acute feeling, on account of which we no longer feel the previous displeasure. The religious (and especially Christian) cure for “depressive discomfort” comes not in the form of an analgesic or a tranquilizer, but, rather, in the form of an “irritating drug” or “excitation-raiser,” a stimulant. The ascetic ideal, writes Nietzsche, is employed to produce orgies of feeling) 2 It is about immersing the human soul in terrors, ice, flames, and raptures to such an extent that it is liberated from all petty displeasure, gloom, and depression) 3 This is the very core of the ascetic ideal: Everywhere the bad conscience, that “abominable beast,” as Luther called it; everywhere the past regurgitated, the fact distorted, the “jaundiced eye” for all action; . everywhere the scourge, the hair shirt, the starving body, contrition; everywhere the sinner breaking himself on the cruel wheel of a restless morbidly lascivious conscience; everywhere dumb torment, extreme fear, the agony of the tortured heart, convulsions of an unknown happiness . . : awake, everlastingly awake, sleepless, glowing, charred, spent and yet not weary—thus was the man, “the sinner,” initiated into this mystery. This ancient mighty sorcerer in his struggle with displeasure, the ascetic priest—he had obviously won, his kingdom had come: one no longer protested against pain, one thirsted for pain; “more pain! more pain!”1” In a word, one could say that the thing the ascetic ideal employs in response to displeasure is jouissance, (surplus-) enjoyment: “morbidly lascivious conscience,” “convulsions of an unknown happiness,” and the fundamental imperative: More! Encore! It also invents the “second body”: a sublime body, sleepless and spent, as if charred, but never weary. Nietzsche repeats this insistently: the ascetic ideal is about excitement—it is, so to speak, a “passion diet”; it is not about moderation, it counters passions with a surplus of pure passion. It might be interesting to note that this problematic is very closely connected to the one discussed by Eric Santner in his book On the Psychotheology of Everyday Life: Reflections on Freud and Rosenzwei. Santner starts from the notion that life—or, taken more narrowly, the psyche—is characterized by a constitutive “too-muchness” (the human mind is defined by the fact that it includes more reality than it can contain—it bears an excess, a “too-muchness” of pressure that is not merely physiological). This “too-muchness” of pressure cannot be done away with, but it can take two different forms or paths: it can be either the agent of our engagement “in the midst of life,” or a defense against such engagement. The line between the two, between the passions infusing our engagement in the world and our defenses against such engagement, is often a thin one. The common path is precisely the one that constrains our capacities “by burdening them with an uncanny sort of surplus animation. We are dealing here with a paradoxical kind of mental energy that constrains by means of excess that leaves us stuck and paralyzed precisely by way of a certain kind of intensification and amplification." This effect, which Santner calls “undeadening,” is generative of a disturbing surplus animation, and is not “unlike the king’s ‘second body’ posited by theorists of sovereignty.”16 What Nietzsche discusses under the name of the ascetic ideal is precisely this kind of passion, in which man is awake—supremely awake, animated and immersed in very strong sensations and feelings—but not alive. The word that Nietzsche uses to express this (a charred man) is very eloquent in itself. In this respect, Nietzsche’s diagnosis is quite contrary to Marx’s diagnosis: religion is not so much the opium of the people, a tranquilizer that constitutes an escape from (harsh) reality, as an “excitation-raiser” which binds us to this reality by activating some mortifying passion. Discomfort is soothed (or silenced) by crises and states of emergency in which a subject feels alive. But this “alive” is nothing other than “undeadness,” the petrifying grip of surplus excitation and agitation. Of course, Nietzsche also often talks about the “opium” dimension of religion: the fairytale about life after death, about the existence of another, better world, about the existence of a righteous judge who can make sense of the often senseless and unfortunate vicissitudes of our daily life. But he does not situate the core of religious mastery (the ascetic ideal) in this dimension. The power and strength of religion (in the form of the ascetic ideal) do not spring from the fact that it promises the suffering and the disappointed a better world in exchange for their faith, thus forcing them to accept and endure the miseries of this world (instead of rising against their causes). Pain and suffering are not simply burdens that a true Christian (who, in Nietzsche’s argument, can very well be an “atheist Christian”) stoically endures; they are, rather, something in relation to which a Christian comes to life as a subject. The core of the ascetic ideal lies in its articulation of the economy of enjoyment that—although it needs a reference to a beyond in order to be operative—operates in this “corporeal” world: it is that it mobilizes and motivates souls, and provides them with enjoyment</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>The desire to mask suffering with enjoyment is the ascetic ideal par excellence. the aff’s morals are employed to make one feel accomplished by their personal restraints.<br/>Zupancic 03 alenka, “The Shortest Shadow: Nietzsche’s Philosophy of the Two,” 47-49</p><p>The ascetic ideal places the Real of pleasure in enjoyment (and posits enjoyment of pain or suffering as the most vivd human experience – an experience in which the degree of self-sensation and self-presence attains its highest intensity, producing a kind of paralyzing wakefulness), and makes it a law. The specificity of this enjoyment-enjoining law—for this is precisely what this law is all about—is that it does not allow for any play of transgression: it does not capture us by means of arousing a transgressive desire to which we cling as to a promise of some secret enjoyment. It is not a law with which we could establish some kind of relationship, situating ourselves as subjects in relation to it. It is a law that leaves nothing outside it, for now, writes Nietzsche, a man is “like a hen imprisoned by a chalk line. He can no longer get out of this chalk cl7 He can, however, rotate in it to infinity: the limit and the infinite are not in contradiction here, since it is the limit itself that is infinite. &nbsp;It is tempting to say that something was in the air in that second half of the nineteenth century, something that brought Nietzsche to his conceptualization of the ascetic ideal and Freud to his theory of the superego. Lacan’s reading of the superego law in terms of the “imperative of enjoyment” is, of course, very significant in this context. Something has changed in the juncture of Law and enjoyment, in their nexus. Of course, Nietzsche recognizes this mode of enjoyment in the whole history of Christianity; he does not conceive of it as of something that has just recently occurred. Nonetheless, this is the fate (and the power) of most concepts: once they are forged, we can easily recognize their elements in past historical formations, or even in other, older concepts. This, however, does not contradict the fact that Nietzsche writes from the perspective of a certain shift or break that befell the history of Christianity (or, more broadly, of Western civilization as based on Christianity), and that it is only in this break that things that “were there all the time” became visible. &nbsp;With the term “ascetic ideal,” Nietzsche names the passage from one logic of the law to another, a passage from the law that forbids and regulates enjoyment to the law that commands (not pleasure, but) enjoyment, confronting us with an imperative of enjoyment. Actually, it would be more accurate to say that the two sides of the law—the prohibition of enjoyment and the surplus of enjoyment— were always linked together, mutually supporting each other. (Surplus-) enjoyment is not simply something that is suppressed or repressed by the law. The prohibition of enjoyment equals the creation of a “beyond” where surplus-enjoyment (although forbidden) finds its place. This “beyond” is the very thing from which the law draws its power to attach us, since the law really functions not when it manages to hold us simply by fear of its authority, but when we adhere to it through a specific mode of (our) enjoyment. The “shift” mentioned above concerns the fact that this other side of the law (its “back side”) becomes its front side. Or, perhaps more precisely: (surplus-) enjoyment is no longer a hidden support of the law; rather, it becomes one with the law, as if a kind of short circuit between the two had been established. This could also be expressed in terms of what, in his book Homo sacer, Giorgio Agamben develops at the political level: modern politics is characterized by the fact that the “state of emergency” (the state that is, at one and the same time, the exception to as well as the support of the rule of law) is itself becoming a rule of law. &nbsp;Thus, the crucial feature of the ascetic ideal does not consist in the fact that the law (as the imperative of duty and self-denial) constitutes a weapon with which we are to fight our passions and drives; the law does not exactly “suppress” the drives and the passions. The problem and power of the ascetic ideal lie in the fact that it is only through it that passion actually “runs wild,” and becomes limitless. In paragraph 229 of Beyond Good and Evil, Nietzsche designates the “fear of the ‘wild, savage beast” (i.e. the fear of what, in men, is supposed to be lawless and animal-like) as superstition. The belief according to which there is some primary “wildness” in man (a wildness that has to be transformed by means of culture and spirit) is an empty belief. If there is a “pure passion” to be found in the history of Christianity (as the essential bearer of the ascetic ideal), it is to be found on the side of the Law, on the side of the ascetic ideal itself. In the struggle against sensuality and corporeality, in the “dissection of conscience,” there is an “abundant, overabundant enjoyment GenuB.”8 And “high culture” is based on the deepening and spiritualizing of cruelty: “that ‘wild beast’ has not been killed off at all, it lives and thrives, and it has only — made a divinity of itself...” It is only with the (Christian) law that sensuality as such gets invented. This was Kierkegaard’s thesis, but for Kierkegaard it basically means that, in contrast to the Greek individuality that strove for a balance between the spiritual and the sensual, Christianity, as the affirmation of the spiritual principle, also established its Other: it excluded the sensual, and thus merely granted it its autonomous existence.2° Nietzsche’s emphasis is slightly different: with the formation of the ascetic ideal, the sensual is not simply the Other of the law, but becomes the very thing that the law gives form to—it becomes one with the law. (The ascetic ideal “is employed to produce orgies of feeling,” as Nietzsche puts it.) The fundamental gesture of the ascetic ideal in relation to the sensual is not exclusion but, rather, something like a complete appropriation, an inclusion without any remainder. The sensual itself takes on the form of the law. If, on the one hand, the purely sensual or boundless passion is a fiction generated by the law (i.e. a fiction of an otherness sustained by the law), it is, on the other hand, the very Real of the law. Pure sensuality (passion, pleasure, voluptuousness) is nothing but the law itself. The law becomes the only Real (in the sense of the only source of excitation, passion, pleasure, and pain): the pleasures that remain outside (it) are, strictly speaking, “null” and “void” in relation to the (overabundant) pleasure that the law provides, gives body to, and enjoins. In this context, the assertion about the “nullity of pleasures” (outside the frame of the ascetic ideal) is not simply empty ideological talk, flatly contradicted by the Real of human experience. The triumph of the ascetic ideal consists precisely in the fact that, at some point, it conquers the very soil of “real human experience.” Before this, the pleasure might well have been dispersed, chaotic, without clear boundaries; yet this does not meant that it was infinite and boundless before the law set limits to it. On the contrary, the law (of the ascetic ideal) is the very name for limitless pleasure, for the enjoyment that became infinite and fathomless. In the ascetic ideal, the law is not something that sets limits to passion, restraining and regulating it. Instead, it is the very outlet of passion. It is the passion of the infinite or an infinite passion—even though it takes the form of an infinite passion to set limits, to purify, to narrow the circle around the pure. The only (now existing) infinite passion is the passion that takes on the form of the law. Precisely as the struggle against displeasure (in response to which it employs enjoyment), Christianity is also a struggle against pleasure, defined exactly as that which, in enjoyment, is not real (“fleeting pleasures,” “passing voluptuousness”) but “illusory.” And the genuine triumph of the ascetic ideal comes when people themselves (atheists included) actually and personally begin to feel that such pleasure is indeed “empty,” “null” and “illusory—that is to say, when it is no longer necessary for all kinds of church authorities to preach about it. This is why the ascetic ideal attains its climax (or becomes what it is) only after the “death of God.” &nbsp;I have already indicated the proximity of these arguments to some of Freud’s claims from Civilization and Its Discontents. What Nietzsche analyzes under the name of “ascetic ideal” corresponds, almost point by point, to what Freud calls the superego, the law of an insatiable passion. The more we obey it, the more we sacrifice to it—the more it wants, and the more it gains in strength and severity. We are dealing with the same image of vampirism that is also present in Nietzsche: the (superego) law literally feeds on the drives, devouring their “blood,” and ultimately becoming the only real locus of enjoyment. It could be said that the superego itself comes to be “structured like a drive.” It is common knowledge that Freud posits a kind of temporal paradox at the very core of the superego and the moral conscience linked to it: the renouncement of the drives creates conscience, and conscience demands the renouncement of the drives.2’ In this way, the very form of renouncing becomes a form of enjoyment, a mode of its organization. This is especially blatant in obsessional neurosis, in which Freud recognizes the paradigm of “religious” thinking.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>Our alternative is to forget about the suffering in the 1ac. the pain cited by the 1ac is only attended to by the memory of the 1ac to further asceticism, only a break away from these memories solves. <br/>Zupancic 03 alenka, “The Shortest Shadow: Nietzsche’s Philosophy of the Two,” 57-60</p><p>This is perhaps the moment to examine in more detail what Nietzschean “forgetting” is actually about. What is the capacity of forgetting as the basis of “great health”? Nietzsche claims that memory entertains some essential relationship with pain. This is what he describes as the principle used in human “mnemotechnics”: “If something is to stay in the memory it must be burned in: only that which never ceases to hurt stays in the memory”21 Thus, if memory is essentially related to pain (here it seems that Nietzsche claims the opposite of what psychoanalysis is claiming: that traumatic events are the privileged objects of repression; yet pain is not the same thing as trauma, just as “forgetting” is not the same thing as repressing), then forgetting refers above all to the capacity not to nurture pain. This also means the capacity not to make pain the determining ground of our actions and choices. What exactly is pain (not so much physical pain, but, rather, the “mental pain” that can haunt our lives)? It is a way in which the subject internalizes and appropriates some traumatic experience as her own bitter treasure, In other words, in relation to the traumatic event, pain is not exactly a part of this event, but already its memory (the “memory of the body”). And Nietzschean oblivion is not so much an effacement of the traumatic encounter as a preservation of its external character, of its foreignness, of its otherness. In Unfashionable Observations, Second Piece (“On the Utility and Liability of History for Life”), Nietzsche links the question of forgetting (which he employs as a synonym for the ahistorical) to the question of the act. Forgetting, oblivion, is the very condition of possibility for an act in the strong sense of the word. Memory (the “historical”) is eternal sleeplessness and alert insomnia, a state in which no great thing can happen, and which could even be said to serve this very purpose. Considering the common conception according to which memory is something monumental that “fixes” certain events, and closes us within their horizon, Nietzsche proposes a significantly different notion. It is precisely as an eternal openness, an unceasing stream, that memory can immobilize us, mortify us, make us incapable of action. Nietzsche invites us to imagine the extreme example of a human being who does not possess the power to forget. Such a human being would be condemned to see becoming everywhere: he would no longer believe in his own being, would see everything flow apart in turbulent particles, and would lose himself in this stream of becoming. He would be like the true student of Heraclitus. A human being who wanted to experience things in a thoroughly historical manner would be like someone forced to go without sleep.28 Memory holds us in eternal motion—it keeps opening numerous horizons, and this is precisely how it immobilizes us, forcing us into frenetic activity. Hence, Nietzsche advances a thesis that is as out of tune with our time as it was with his own: “every living thing can become healthy, strong and fruitful only within a defined horizon; if it is incapable of drawing a horizon around itself and too selfish, in turn, to enclose its own perspective within an alien horizon, then it will feebly waste away or hasten to its timely end.”29 Of course, Nietzsche’s aim here is not to preach narrow-mindedness and pettiness, nor is it simply to affirm the ahistorical against history and memory. On the contrary, he clearly states that it is only by thinking, reflecting, comparing, analyzing, and synthesizing (i.e. only by means of the power to utilize the past for life, and to reshape past events into history) that the human being becomes properly human. Yet, in the excess of history, the human being ceases to be human once again, no longer able to create or invent. This is why Nietzsche insists that “every great historical event” is born in the “ahistorical atmosphere,” that is to say, in conditions of oblivion and closure: Imagine a man seized and carried away by a vehement passion for a woman or for a great idea; how his world changes’ Looking backward he feels he is blind, listening around he hears what is unfamiliar as a dull, insignificant sound; and those things that he perceives at all he never before perceived in this way; so palpable and near, colorful, resonant, illuminated, as though he were apprehending it with all his senses at once. All his valuations are changed and devalued;. . . It is the most unjust condition in the world, narrow, ungrateful to the past, blind to dangers, deaf to warnings; a tiny whirlpool of life in a dead sea of night and oblivion; and yet this condition—ahistorical, antihistorical through and through— is not only womb of the unjust deed, but of every just deed as well; and no aftist will create a picture, no general win a victory, and no people gain its freedom without their having previously desired and striven to accomplish these deeds in just such an ahistorical condition. . Thus, everyone who acts loves his action infinitely more than it deserves to be loved, and the best deeds occur in such an exuberance of love that, no matter what, they must be unworthy of this love, even if their worth were otherwise incalculably great.3° If we read this passage carefully, we note that the point is not simply that the capacity to forget, or the “ahistorical condition,” is the condition of “great deeds” or “events.” On the contrary: it is the pure surplus of passion or love (for something) that brings about this closure of memory, this “ahistorical condition.” In other words, it is not that we have first to close ourselves within a defined horizon in order then to be able to accomplish something. The closure takes place with the very (“passionate”) opening toward something (“a woman or a great idea”). Nietzsche’s point is that if this surplus passion engages us “in the midst of life,” instead of mortifying us, it does so via its inducement of forgetting. Indeed, I could mention a quite common experience here: whenever something important happens to us and incites our passion, we tend to forget and dismiss the grudges and resentments we might have been nurturing before. Instead of “forgiving” those who might have injured us in the past, we forget and dismiss these injuries. If we do not, if we “work on our memory” and strive to keep these grudges alive, they will most probably affect and mortify our (new) passion. It could also be interesting to relate Nietzsche’s reflections from the quoted passage to the story of Hamlet, in which the imperative to remember, uttered by Hamlet’s father’s Ghost, plays a very prominent role. Remember me! Remember me!, the Ghost repeats to Hamlet, thus engaging him in the singular rhythm that characterizes the hero of this play—that of the alternation between resigned apathy and frenetic activity or precipitate actions (his killing of Polonius, as well as that of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern; his engagement in the duel with Laertes . . .). This movement prevents Hamlet from carrying out the very deed his father’s Ghost charges him with. Many things have been said and written about the relationship between action and knowledge in this play, and about how knowledge prevents Hamlet from acting. Although the two notions are not unrelated, it might be interesting to consider this also in terms of memory (not only in terms of knowledge). It could be worthwhile to contemplate the role played by the imperative of memory. Could we not say that one of the fundamental reasons for the difficulty of Hamlet’s position is precisely the structural incompatibility of memory and action— that is to say, the fact that action ultimately always “betrays” memory? And do we not encounter something similar in the wider phenomenon of melancholy (in the play, Hamlet is actually said to be “melancholic”) as a never-ending grief that keeps alive, through pain, the memory of what was lost? Additionally, although we can recognize in this kind of melancholy a form of fidelity (for instance—to use Nietzsche’s words—fidelity to “a woman or a great idea”), this kind of fidelity, bound to memory, should be distinguished from fidelity to the very event of the encounter with this woman or idea. Contrary to the first form, this second form of fidelity implies and presupposes the power to forget.

Five years after the president promised to close the detention center for alleged terrorists the prison remains open and continues to leave a stain on the honor and integrity of the United States and its proclaimed commitment to universal human rights.<br/>With a brief and unambiguous message to Cuba’s President Raúl Castro, President Obama could <br/>AND<br/>could break through the barriers of distrust and misunderstanding both countries have erected.<br/>Most Americans don’t know the history of Guantánamo. Under the terms of the 1902 <br/>AND<br/>/11 attacks the military converted the camp to a high security prison.<br/>To be sure, several matters would need to be negotiated in order to implement this "simple" solution. Apart from the disposition of the base facilities, the two countries would need to agree on the latitude Cuba would have with regard to the prisoners. For example, the United States might seek assurances that Cuba would prevent the travel of released prisoners to the United States or a U.S. territory.<br/>But once positive energy vibrates through U.S.-Cuba diplomacy, many of the disagreements between the two countries would emerge as soluble, as solutions build on one another to engender confidence. It is likely that even before the details of returning the naval base to Cuba were settled, the two countries might be able to overcome the most vexing, immediate source of irritation between them.<br/>The United States holds in federal prisons four Cuban agents convicted of espionage, and Cuba holds an employee of a U.S. Agency for International Development subcontractor convicted of "acts against the independence or territorial integrity of the state." Just as we have swapped prisoners with Russia and other adversaries, there is nothing stopping us from exchanging Mr. Gross for the four and allowing them all to return to their homes.<br/>Similarly, Cuba has successfully negotiated agreements over expropriated property with every country except the United States. The typical debt-for-equity formula Cuba has used could resolve this fifty-year old issue to the benefit of U.S. citizens and corporations, and might even open the way to new U.S. investment in Cuba.<br/>Or consider that the United States and Cuba already have achieved impressive levels of cooperation in areas of mutual concern - such as drug interdiction and natural disaster preparation - which would be even more effective if the engagements could be deepened, institutionalized, and undertaken without fear of domestic repercussions.<br/>The U.S.-Cuba relationship has baffled ten previous U.S. <br/>AND<br/>until now the United States has responded with a self-defeating aloofness.<br/>As dozens of Guantánamo detainees continue their hunger strike, and a ruling about force-feeding them remains in limbo between different federal courts, the moment is ripe for President Obama to act with courage and decisiveness. Guantánamo gives him the opportunity of turning a lemon into lemonade.</p><h4 id="HEngagementwithCubaisappeasement" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Engagement with Cuba is appeasement</span></h4><p>Rubin ’11 - Labor Law Attorney and Washington Post Journalist, quotes the chairwoman of the foreign affairs committee, quotes a report by the Associated Press, quotes the former deputy national security advisor, (Jennifer, August 18, 2011, "Obama’s Cuba appeasement", <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/post/obamas-cuba-appeasement/2011/03/29/gIQAjuL2tL_blog.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/post/obamas-cuba-appeasement/2011/03/29/gIQAjuL2tL_blog.html%27" tppabs="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/post/obamas-cuba-appeasement/2011/03/29/gIQAjuL2tL_blog.html"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/post/obamas-cuba-appeasement/2011/03/29/gIQAjuL2tL_blog.html</span></a></span> )<em>HH</em></p><p>The chairwoman of the foreign affairs committee, Rep.

Our willingness to relax sanctions was not greeted with goodwill gestures, let alone systemic reforms. To the contrary, this was the setting for Gross’s imprisonment. So naturally the administration orders up more of the same.<br/>Throughout his tenure, President Obama has failed to comprehend the cost-benefit analysis that despotic regimes undertake. He has offered armfuls of goodies and promised quietude on human rights; the despots’ behavior has worsened. There is simply no downside for rogue regimes to take their shots at the United States.<br/>Whether it is Cuba or Iran, the administration reverts to "engagement" mode <br/>AND<br/>to throw gifts to tyrants in the expectation they will reciprocate in kind.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HSingleissuesaren2019tkeytocred.-3" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Single issues aren’t key to cred.</span></h4><p>Lake, 10– Professor of Social Sciences, distinguished professor of political science at UC San Diego (David A., "Making America Safe for the World: Multilateralism and the Rehabilitation of US authority", <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://dss.ucsd.edu/~~dlake/documents/LakeMakingAmericaSafe.pdf)//DR.  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://dss.ucsd.edu/~~dlake/documents/LakeMakingAmericaSafe.pdf)//DR.%27" tppabs="http://dss.ucsd.edu/~~dlake/documents/LakeMakingAmericaSafe.pdf)//DR."><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://dss.ucsd.edu/~~dlake/documents/LakeMakingAmericaSafe.pdf)//DR.</span></a></span> H<br/> <br/>President Obama and his administration appear to recognize the need to bolster the authority and <br/>AND<br/>even deeper into multilateral institutions that can provide real checks on potential opportunism.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="H22Credibility22isirrelevant2013stateswillevaluatethreatsbasedoffcurrentcapabilitiesandinterests2013basicallyeveryacademicstudyisonoursideandyou2019llonlyhaveevidencefromthinktankersandpundits." class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>"Credibility" is irrelevant – states will evaluate threats based off current capabilities and interests – basically every academic study is on our side and you’ll only have evidence from think tankers and pundits.</span></h4><p><strong>Fettweis 08</strong> – Professor of political science at Tulane (Christopher, "Credibility and the War on Terror," Winter 2008, Political Science Quarterly)<em>Bwang<br/>*Sociology and Evidence proves.</em></p><p>Since Vietnam, scholars have been generally unable to identify cases in which high credibility <br/>AND<br/>a coherent test; when it was, it almost inevitably failed.40</p><h4 id="HCuba2019snotkeytoLatinAmericanrelations2Corplanhurtsthem" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Cuba’s not key to Latin American relations, or plan hurts them</span></h4><p>Suchlicki 2k.

But there are signs that views might be shifting on both sides of the Florida Straits.<br/>In the past week, the two countries have held talks on resuming direct mail <br/>AND<br/>changes, including making it easier for Cubans to travel off the island.<br/>Under the radar, diplomats on both sides describe a sea change in the tone of their dealings.<br/>Only last year, Cuban state television was broadcasting grainy footage of American diplomats meeting with dissidents on Havana streets and publically accusing them of being CIA front-men. Today, U.S. diplomats in Havana and Cuban Foreign Ministry officials have easy contact, even sharing home phone numbers.<br/>Josefina Vidal, Cuba’s top diplomat for North American affairs, recently traveled to Washington and met twice with State Department officials — a visit that came right before the announcements of resumptions in the two sets of bilateral talks that had been suspended for more than two years. Washington has also granted visas to prominent Cuban officials, including the daughter of Cuba’s president.<br/>"These recent steps indicate a desire on both sides to try to move forward, but also a recognition on both sides of just how difficult it is to make real progress," said Robert Pastor, a professor of international relations at American University and former national security adviser on Latin America during the Carter administration. "These are tiny, incremental gains, and the prospects of going backwards are equally high."<br/>Among the things that have changed, John Kerry has taken over as U.S. secretary of state after being an outspoken critic of Washington’s policy on Cuba while in the Senate. President Barack Obama no longer has re-election concerns while dealing with the Cuban-American electorate in Florida, where there are also indications of a warming attitude to negotiating with Cuba.<br/>Cuban President Raul Castro, meanwhile, is striving to overhaul the island’s Marxist economy <br/>AND<br/>private businesses and refurbish homes bought under Castro’s limited free-market reforms.<br/>Several prominent Cuban dissidents have been allowed to travel recently due to Castro’s changes. The trips have been applauded by Washington, and also may have lessened Havana’s worries about the threat posed by dissidents.<br/>Likewise, a U.S. federal judge’s decision to allow Cuban spy Rene Gonzalez to return home was met with only muted criticism inside the United States, perhaps emboldening U.S. diplomats to seek further openings with Cuba.</p><h4 id="HTheCubangovernmentcan2019tcontroltheoutcome2014-lackofscapegoatcausesdisruptiveuprising" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>The Cuban government can’t control the outcome—-lack of scapegoat causes disruptive uprising</span></h4><p>Koenig, 10 – US Army Colonel, paper submitted for a Masters in Strategic Studies at the US Army War College (Lance, "Time for a New Cuba Policy" <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA518130)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA518130)%27" tppabs="http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA518130)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA518130)</span></a></span></p><p>The United States needs to take the initiative away from the Castro regime, and <br/>AND<br/>the Cuban economy sputters and the government realizes they don’t have a scapegoat.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HObamaispursuinghard-linepoliciesnow2013rejecttheirevidence2013itspartisannonsense" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Obama is pursuing hard-line policies now – reject their evidence – its partisan nonsense</span></h4><p>*Obama has massive credibility now – his hardline policies are off the roof – he escalated the war in Afghanistan, led efforts to impose harsher economic sanctions on Iran, adopted a hostile stance regarding China’s ambitious territorial claims and became the godfather of NATO’s military campaign – your evidence is bizarre cherry picking and partisan nonsense<br/>Mataconis 12 – B.A. in Political Science from Rutgers University and J.D. from George Mason University School of Law (Doug, and~2334;The GOP’s Ridiculous Appeasement Argumentand~2334;, January 3 of 2012, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/the-gops-ridiculous-appeasement-argument/)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/the-gops-ridiculous-appeasement-argument/)%27" tppabs="http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/the-gops-ridiculous-appeasement-argument/)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/the-gops-ridiculous-appeasement-argument/)</span></a></span> <em>&nbsp;CB</em></p><p>This isn’t really entirely new, of course.

Rather suddenly, the center of gravity of global energy production has swung toward the Americas as shale oil and gas fields in North Dakota and Texas hum with activity. America is moving to the fore as the world’s largest producer of petroleum and natural gas. That change will reorder the globe in ways large and small.<br/>U.S. experts say it will prolong the United States’ position as the predominant global superpower. Arab nations that shook the world with the 1973 oil embargo almost certainly will be weakened. Russia will find its power ebb as European nations find alternate suppliers for natural gas.

warned Israel on Thursday that it could face a third Palestinian uprising and deepening international isolation if American-brokered peace negotiations failed.<br/>Both Israel and the Palestinians have given grim assessments of the lack of progress in their talks, which the United States helped revive last July after a three-year hiatus.<br/>Kerry, speaking in Jordan a day after a visit to Israel, where he appealed for limits on its settlement building in the occupied West Bank, reported the negotiations had made "significant progress" in some areas.<br/>He said it was important to keep aiming towards a full "final status" accord tackling issues at the core of the decades-old conflict, in contrast with more modest interim deals plagued by diplomatic deadlock and years of violence.<br/>In an interview with Israel’s Channel 2 television recorded in Jerusalem before he left for Amman, Kerry painted a bleak picture of what might lie ahead if peace is not achieved.<br/>"I

there will be an increasing isolation of Israel, there will be an increasing campaign of delegitimization of Israel that has been taking place on an international basis."<br/>Kerry was due to meet Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in Amman later on Thursday before returning to Jerusalem for more talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday.<br/>"Both Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Abbas reaffirmed their commitment to these negotiations despite the fact that at moments there are obviously tensions," Kerry said.<br/>Friction over the talks has risen in the last week because of Israeli plans, announced in tandem with its release of 26 Palestinian prisoners, for some 3,500 new homes for Jewish settlers in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem.<br/>Palestinians have warned of a crisis if Israel continues to insist that they effectively agreed to turn a blind eye to the settlement expansion, in exchange for the progressive release of 104 long-serving inmates.<br/>After meeting Abbas on Wednesday in the West Bank city of Bethlehem, Kerry said Palestinians had never condoned settlements, which they and many countries view as illegal and the United States terms illegitimate.<br/>Palestinians fear the enclaves, built on land Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war and which they seek for a future state, will deny them a viable country. Israel cites biblical and historical links to the territory.<br/>Kerry, whose shuttle diplomacy helped to revive the talks, has set a nine-month schedule for an agreement, despite widespread skepticism.<br/>"I remain absolutely committed to this ability to get a final status (agreement)," Kerry said at a news conference in Amman, repeatedly warning of "prolonged, continued conflict", violence and confrontation if the talks failed.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HPlanshiftsKerry2019sfocus.-2" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Plan shifts Kerry’s focus.</span></h4><p>Anderson and Grewell 2k, (Terry L., Executive Director of the Property and Environment Research Center, J.

Although Palestine itself would obviously be non-nuclear, its overall strategic impact could nonetheless be magnified by continuously unfolding and more-or-less unpredictable developments in Egypt, Syria, Libya, Lebanon and elsewhere in this roiling and chaotic area.<br/>A nuclear war could arrive in Israel not only as a "bolt-from<br/>AND<br/>reprisals might be met, in the future, with enemy nuclear counterstrikes.<br/>For now, this would become possible only if a still-nuclearizing Iran were <br/>AND<br/>the first place, could reduce Israel’s escalatory exposure to a nuclear war.<br/>Pertinent questions arise. With its implicit ("deliberately ambiguous") nuclear capacities, why should Israel need a conventional deterrent at all? After all, even after Palestinian statehood, wouldn’t all rational enemy states desist from launching any conventional or biological attacks upon Israel out of an entirely sensible fear of Israeli nuclear retaliation? <br/>Not necessarily. Aware that Israel would cross the nuclear threshold only in very extraordinary circumstances, these enemy states could be convinced – rightly or wrongly – that as long as their attacks remained recognizably non-nuclear, Israel would always respond in kind.<br/>The only credible way for Israel to deter large-scale conventional attacks after the <br/>AND<br/>were undertaken, lead quickly via escalation to various forms of unconventional war. <br/>However unforeseen, Palestine, already a "nonmember observer state" at the United Nations, would have measurably corrosive effects on power and peace in the Middle East. As, by definition, the creation of this particular Arab state would come at the territorial expense of Israel, the Jewish state’s strategic depth would promptly and irretrievably diminish. Over time, Israel’s conventional capacity to ward off enemy attacks could be commensurately reduced. <br/>If certain enemy states were to perceive Israel’s own sense of expanding weakness and possible <br/>AND<br/>prove calamitous for the "winner," as well as the "loser."<br/>To be sure, a meaningful risk of regional nuclear war in the Middle East exists independently of any Palestinian state. Still, this unprecedented risk would be further enlarged if a 23rd Arab state were to appear more-or-less simultaneously with Iranian nuclear weapons. Above anything else, Israel must now do what is needed to prevent such coinciding and mutually-reinforcing and existential perils.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HText:TheUnitedStatesfederalgovernmentshouldestablishaSecurityandProsperityPartnershiptoofferefficiency-basedconcessionstoMexicoinexchangeforatechnicalnegotiationsframeworktoincreaseitseconomicengagementinenergyinfrastructuretowardsMexico." class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Text: The United States federal government should establish a Security and Prosperity Partnership to offer efficiency-based concessions to Mexico in exchange for a technical negotiations framework to increase its economic engagement in energy infrastructure towards Mexico.</span></h4><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HThecounterplanisdistinctandvitaltopolicysustainability2013concessionsarekeytoremedylackoftrust2Cwhichunderminesfuturecooperation" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>The counterplan is distinct and vital to policy sustainability – concessions are key to remedy lack of trust, which undermines future cooperation</span></h4><p>Anderson and Sands, 7 – *Assistant Professor, Department of Political Science, University of Alberta, <strong>Senior Fellow, Hudson Institute (Greg, Christopher, "Negotiating North America: The Security and Prosperity Partnership", Hudson Institute White Papers, Summer 2007)<em>SJF</em></strong></p><p>U.S. wealth and strength are not always decisive in negotiations with Canada <br/>AND<br/>and Mexico City rather than creative offers of assistance that advance shared goals. <br/>This dynamic, although frustrating to some in Washington, has been a persistent feature <br/>AND<br/>the minds of our negotiating partners, and so can often go unspoken. <br/>The postwar growth of regimes and institutions like the NAFTA and the World Trade Organization has been fueled by the desire of relatively weaker countries to curb the ability of stronger ones to resolve economic disputes by capitalizing on asymmetrical advantages.

Preparing for death can enrich your living experiences. Once you can look death in the eye and feel nothing but pleasant, yet mild, anticipation, then life becomes much more enjoyable.<br/>This epitaph taken from a headstone in Ashby, Massachusetts, describes the basic truth.<br/>Remember, friends, as you pass by,<br/>as you are now, so once was I.<br/>As I am now, so you must be.<br/>Prepare yourself to follow me.<br/>You are well-advised to prepare yourself for death. But whether you are ready or not, when your self-determined hour arrives you will pass to the next dimension. Your hour is determined by you and your council — not the little you that operates in the conscious mind, but the greater You that operates in harmony with Divine Source. This higher self, as it is often referred to, maintains the direct connection to the Divine Source.<br/>A little preparation can make the death experience more pleasant and thus more peaceful for you as well as those you leave behind. Here are some suggestions for this preparation.<br/>TALKING ABOUT DEATH<br/>Allow yourself to talk about death as a part of life. I assure you, you do not bring death closer to you by talking about it, and you may make yourself more comfortable with the concept. By avoiding the topic you shroud it in mystery and shame. It becomes one of those topics that we don’t talk about in polite society.<br/>Upon death you will create your own death experience based on what you believe. <br/>AND<br/>process of open forum allows you to open to a variety of possibilities.<br/>While Mom was in the hospital, she and I had an opportunity to discuss death. Although she was very confused and scared of death, she listened to my views and shared her own. She talked about what she wanted to happen (and how) if she died. At this point no one believed that she would be dead in less than two months. The conversation was one I shall always remember and treasure.<br/>A colleague at the university, Don, and I discussed the recent death of a co-worker. We talked about death — his beliefs and mine. It was to be our last conversation, for he died just a few days later.<br/>These conversations help to acclimate people to the transition process. Neither Don or Mom knew consciously that they were soon to die. Yet both felt the need to discuss death. It is important to be comfortable enough with the topic to discuss it when the conversation arises. Often there is an inner knowing and a need to discuss death as the hour approaches, much like the impending birth of a child is discussed.<br/>People have taken the topic of death, and even the words associated with it, and made them naughty — something we don’t speak aloud in public. Children are shushed or quickly diverted if they bring up the topic. Our society is "death-a-phobic" and it’s time this is changed.<br/>By becoming comfortable with the words and concepts, when the magic moment arrives and <br/>AND<br/>dead" as familiar as the word "birth" and "life". <br/>Birth and death are both times of transition. They imply a change from one dimensional form to another. You don’t see people going to pieces because someone gave birth like you do when people (especially themselves) die. Yet birth is much more traumatic and generally unpleasant to the one experiencing it. Death is a much easier transition.<br/>A WORKING REALITY OF DEATH<br/>Take a minute to imagine the following scene.<br/>You find yourself inside a large cube or box. It can be of any material you choose. You are completely enclosed in this box. There are no doors or windows, no way to get in or out. You do not know how you got in or how to get out.<br/>As you imagine yourself in this box, what are your reactions? What thoughts or feelings do you have? Remain in this imaginary state for a minute or so to fully experience your feelings.<br/>STOP21 DON’T READ ANY FURTHER UNTIL YOU HAVE TAKEN A MINUTE TO EXPERIENCE THIS SENSATION21<br/>Good. Did you feel panic? How about curiosity? There are a multitude of reactions, and yours are perfectly normal regardless of what they were.<br/>Your reactions to this exercise are similar to those you might experience as you pass into death. Now reexamine your reactions to the box, only apply these to death. How do you feel about death? Don’t judge yourself, simply examine. You now have a starting point from which to examine your current death beliefs.<br/>For our second exercise, imagine yourself walking down a path. Create your path; notice the details. Is it wide, narrow, smooth, rough, beautiful, not-so-beautiful, straight, or winding? You decide. After you walk for awhile you come to a wall. The wall can be any form you like, but it must run across your path and stretch so far that you cannot walk around it. Create the wall now21<br/>Now move beyond the wall. What do you see? Take a minute to experience this vision. Relax and play with the images. Don’t read on until you have experienced this21<br/>No fudging21<br/>This path represents your view of your life. Was your life easy or rough? Was your path well worn, or are you blazing new trails? Was your path straight or winding? If you did not like your path, know that you have full power to change it any time you choose. You can add plants, flowers — in short, create any path you choose whenever you choose.<br/>Examine the wall. Was it high and solid or low and insubstantial? What kind was it? How did you move beyond the wall? Was it hard? What were your reactions to moving beyond the wall? What did you find on the other side?<br/>The wall represents the separation of life and death. Beyond the wall is your symbolic subconscious view of the afterlife. Now reexamine your images. If you do not like what you experienced, simply choose a new creation and construct new images.<br/>There are no right answers, yet, at the same time, all answers are right. Your answers represent a combination of what you have been conditioned to believe about death and your personal reality of death. If you are happy with your subconscious death reality, that’s great. If you are uncomfortable with your symbolic representation of death, then create a new one as you read on.<br/>Death need not be scary. In fact, in many ways death can be <br/>AND<br/>to do, no tuition to pay, nor written exams to take.<br/>As you get comfortable with the concept of death, then you can begin to let go of any fearful notions of death. Allow yourself to have a variety of death options, all pleasant. This allows you to stay open and receptive to your own unique death adventure when it occurs, which may be different from the one you have created.<br/>If, however, the concept of death still makes you tremble with fear, <br/>AND<br/>be a pleasant first encounter, certainly much better than fear or panic.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HFailedstatesdon2019tcauseterrorismwhichistheterminalimpactintheirmanwaringevidence" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Failed states don’t cause terrorism which is the terminal impact in their manwaring evidence</span></h4><p>Patrick, ’11 ~Stewart, Research Fellow at the Center for Global Development, "Weak Links: Fragile States, Global Threats, and International Security," Google Books~&nbsp;</p><p>A central motivation for recent U.S. and international attention to weak and <br/>AND<br/>may pursue ambiguous policies, particularly if the state itself is internally fragmented.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p><strong>====No impact to bioterror.====</strong><br/><strong>Soligenex 13&nbsp;</strong>(Soligenex Inc. is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing products to treat inflammatory diseases and biodefense countermeasures, BioDefense and Emerging Diseases, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.soligenix.com/prod_def.shtml  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.soligenix.com/prod_def.shtml%27" tppabs="http://www.soligenix.com/prod_def.shtml"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.soligenix.com/prod_def.shtml</span></a></span>, Website last updated 2013)</p><p>Since 2001, a new sense of vulnerability to radiation, infectious diseases, toxins <br/>AND<br/>), referred to as OrbeShield™, for gastrointestinal Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS).</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HNochemicalterrorism" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>No chemical terrorism</span></h4><p>Erwin and Manguson 2009 – managing editor of National Defense Magazine (Sandra and Stew, National Defense Magazine, "7 deadly myths about weapons of terror", <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/ARCHIVE/2009/JUNE/Pages/7Deadly.aspx?PF=1  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/ARCHIVE/2009/JUNE/Pages/7Deadly.aspx?PF=1%27" tppabs="http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/ARCHIVE/2009/JUNE/Pages/7Deadly.aspx?PF=1"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/ARCHIVE/2009/JUNE/Pages/7Deadly.aspx?PF=1</span></a></span>, WEA)</p><p>Myth ~237: Nerve Gasses Are Terrorists’ Chemical Weapons of Choice To say that <br/>AND<br/>States to carry out their plot.

For every extra dollar taken from drivers’ pockets at the pump in the form of higher prices in recent years, low-cost exporters from China and elsewhere have put roughly 241.50 back in the form of cheaper retail goods. Even at today’s near-record prices, U.S. households today spend less than 4 of their disposable income at the pump, vs. over 6 in 1980.<br/>Current prices are also a reflection of a strong economy, not an oil embargo or war in the Middle East. Since a market-share war between Saudi Arabia and Venezuela flooded the market with oil and drove prices to below 2411 a barrel in 1998, oil prices have risen nearly eight-fold. During that run, the global economy grew roughly 5 each year.<br/>Strong growth in places like China helps take some of the edge off the oil-price blow for U.S. and European companies such as Detroit’s Big Three auto makers. Many emerging markets are hitting a "takeoff" stage, where per-capita income reaches a level that sparks serious auto demand, says Ellen Hughes-Cromwick, Ford Motor Co.’s chief economist. Growth in emerging markets is a "structural development" that is "less sensitive to oil-price changes," she says.<br/>"There’s a more relaxed attitude now," said Daniel Yergin, a noted oil historian and chairman of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. At a recent event promoting Alan Greenspan’s new memoir, Mr. Yergin asked the former Fed chief on stage if 2480 oil was a concern. "He basically shrugged and said, ’Not so far,’" Mr. Yergin recalls.<br/>Economists see global growth slowing but still chugging along at a relatively healthy 3 <br/>AND<br/>energy economist Philip Verleger Jr. "And that investment is happening."</p></div></div></td><td>12/8/13</td></tr><tr><td style="width:100%; word-break:break-all; word-break:break-word;"><div><p><input onclick="saveEntry(12)" src="../../xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" tppabs="http://hspolicy13.debatecoaches.org/xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" style="float:right;" title="Save" type="image" value="Save"></input>
