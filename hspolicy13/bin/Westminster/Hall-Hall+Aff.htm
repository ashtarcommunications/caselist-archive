It was the ?rst signi?cant trade with Cuba since 1963. <br/>Cubans apparently liked what they bought, and soon the invisible hand of supply and <br/>AND<br/>business leaders hoping to convince Cubans to use their port for food shipments. <br/>These visits were but a prelude to the main event in 2003: a privately <br/>AND<br/>major market for U.S. corn, wheat and soybeans.’’4 <br/>So here we are, at a time when national security of?cials no longer have <br/>AND<br/>lose two; Florida has twenty-seven and will probably gain two). <br/>At ?rst, Cuban immigrants were politically impotent, but soon they began to take <br/>AND<br/>-fashioned way, with campaign contri- butions and bloc voting.6<br/>And CANF did this at a propitious moment: it had spent the 1980s honing <br/>AND<br/>is that we look to the rest of the world like idiots.’’8 <br/>Then came Elián González, the ?ve-year-old boy found clinging to <br/>AND<br/>W. Bush the presidency with a ?ve-vote electoral college margin. <br/>Since then, the question has been: When will Cuban Americans begin to vote <br/>AND<br/>imme- diately allow unlimited family travel and remittances to the island.’’<br/>When implemented in 2009, this relaxation of the embargo’s travel and remittance provisions more <br/>AND<br/>hijacked boat in the Straits of Florida and returned the hijackers to Cuba. <br/>Enough is enough, wrote ninety-eight prominent Cuban Americans, taking out an <br/>AND<br/>-line Cuban American base and probably contributed to his win in Florida. <br/>Both George Bush and Barack Obama understood the importance of Flor- ida’s Cuban Americans<br/>AND<br/>up on family visits and remit- tances. And he won Florida. <br/>So where is U.S. policy heading? Given the torpor that has <br/>AND<br/>, the pollsters will tell everyone it is safe to end the estrangement. <br/>The truly interesting question is what might come after that. No one knows, <br/>AND<br/>exactly what we should: Go down and lift those people up.’’10 <br/>We should not make too much of this off-the-cuff response, <br/>AND<br/>word and I’ll turn that f—— island into a parking lot.’’11 <br/>What would seem puzzling to a visitor from another planet is why, when the <br/>AND<br/>major issue for Kennedy, who had much else on his mind.’’12<br/>And this combination of awesome power and globe-girding responsibili- ties helps explain <br/>AND<br/>that would cost in the currency that might matter most: world opinion. <br/>So what was plan B? First, there were a few years of what <br/>AND<br/>we ought to do to pinch their nuts more than we’re doing.’’14 <br/>Nut pinching—an embargo—has been U.S. policy ever since<br/>AND</p><dl><dt>’’we might just as well get used to the idea.’’16<br/>But tugging U.S. policy toward greater involvement is domestic politics— Cuban <br/>AND<br/>’’ Like its predecessor, the Obama administration is committed to uplifting Cuba. <br/>Like the two post–Cold War presidents sandwiched between them—Bill Clinton and <br/>AND<br/>- tion, the greater energy, the purer morality of America.’’19 <br/>Today’s uplifting effort, which focuses on promoting democracy, carries on a tradition established <br/>AND<br/>a day or of a year, but of a longer period.’’20 <br/>Wood’s letter arrived in Washington at a moment when McKinley’s thoughts were on domestic politics—reelection—and when the rival Demo- crats were already making political capital out of his administration’s inability to pacify the Philippines, another part of the spoils seized from Spain. Seeking to balance that quagmire with progress in Cuba, the president ordered Wood to draw up the ?rst U.S. plan for Cuba’s democracy. <br/>Wood did so. It began with the disenfranchisement of that part of the Cuban <br/>AND<br/>San Domingo, will be regarded as an event of ?rst importance.’’21 <br/>But then, when given their opportunity to vote—for Cuba’s ?rst constitu- <br/>AND<br/>change of government, unless it be annexation to the United States.’’22 <br/>But the Republicans had made an unambiguous campaign commitment to Cuban independence, and so <br/>AND<br/>. Estrada Palma’s election ended Washington’s ?rst effort to promote democracy in Cuba.<br/>A second effort began four years later, in 1906, when a substantial number <br/>AND<br/>am seeking the very minimum of interference necessary to make them good.’’ <br/>Forced to the defensive after retaking a country only recently granted its independence, Roosevelt’s <br/>AND<br/>you need here among the Cubans is a desire to make money.’’25 <br/>As did Leonard Wood before him, Taft understood that the uplifting would not be <br/>AND<br/>by administering their Gov- ernment for two years or twenty years.’’27 <br/>As an alternative to a time-consuming attempt to de-Hispanicize Cuban culture<br/>AND<br/>elec- tion, and in early 1909, he sailed for home. <br/>Although U.S. forces returned in 1912 to quash a complex Afro-<br/>AND<br/>sugar estates in central Cuba, where they stayed for ?ve years.28 <br/>It was during this partial occupation that the Wilson administration pres- sured President Mario <br/>AND<br/>recommendations which the President has instructed General Crowder to convey to him.’’29 <br/>Two days later, Crowder sailed into Havana’s harbor aboard a battleship, the USS <br/>AND<br/>.

H)</em></p><p>For years American political leaders and media were fond of labeling Cuba an "international pariah". We haven’t heard that for a very long time. Perhaps one reason is the annual vote in the United Nations General Assembly on the resolution which reads: "Necessity of ending the economic, commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba". This is how the vote has gone (not including abstentions):<br/>Year Votes (Yes-No) No Votes <br/>1992 59-2 US, Israel 1993 88-4 US, Israel, Albania, Paraguay <br/>1994 101-2 US, Israel 1995 117-3 US, Israel, Uzbekistan <br/>1996 138-3 US, Israel, Uzbekistan <br/>1997 143-3 US, Israel, Uzbekistan <br/>1998 157-2 US, Israel <br/>1999 155-2 US, Israel <br/>2000 167-3 US, Israel, Marshall Islands <br/>2001 167-3 US, Israel, Marshall Islands 2002 173-3 US, Israel, Marshall Islands <br/>2003 179-3 US, Israel, Marshall Islands <br/>2004 179-4 US, Israel, Marshall Islands, Palau <br/>2005 182-4 US, Israel, Marshall Islands, Palau <br/>2006 183-4 US, Israel, Marshall Islands, Palau <br/>2007 184-4 US, Israel, Marshall Islands, Palau <br/>2008 185-3 US, Israel, Palau <br/>2009 187-3 US, Israel, Palau <br/>2010 187-2 US, Israel <br/>2011 186-2 US, Israel <br/>2012 188-3 US, Israel, Palau <br/>2013 188-2 US, Israel <br/>Each fall the UN vote is a welcome reminder that the world has not completely lost its senses and that the American empire does not completely control the opinion of other governments.<br/>Speaking before the General Assembly, October 29, Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez declared: "The economic damages accumulated after half a century as a result of the implementation of the blockade amount to 241.126 trillion." He added that the blockade "has been further tightened under President Obama’s administration", some 30 US and foreign entities being hit with 242.446 billion in fines due to their interaction with Cuba.<br/>However, the American envoy, Ronald Godard, in an appeal to other countries to oppose the resolution, said:<br/>"The international community … cannot in good conscience ignore the ease and frequency with which the Cuban regime silences critics, disrupts peaceful assembly, impedes independent journalism and, despite positive reforms, continues to prevent some Cubans from leaving or returning to the island. The Cuban government continues its tactics of politically motivated detentions, harassment and police violence against Cuban citizens."~1~<br/>So there you have it. That is why Cuba must be punished. One can only guess what Mr. Godard would respond if told that more than 7,000 people were arrested in the United States during the Occupy Movement’s first 8 months of protest;~2~ that their encampments were violently smashed up; that many of them were physically abused by the police.<br/>Does Mr. Godard ever read a newspaper or the Internet, or watch television? Hardly a day passes in America without a police officer shooting to death an unarmed person?<br/>As to "independent journalism" – what would happen if Cuba announced that from now on anyone in the country could own any kind of media? How long would it be before CIA money – secret and unlimited CIA money financing all kinds of fronts in Cuba – would own or control most of the media worth owning or controlling?<br/>The real reason for Washington’s eternal hostility toward Cuba? The fear of a good example of an alternative to the capitalist model; a fear that has been validated repeatedly over the years as Third World countries have expressed their adulation of Cuba.<br/>How the embargo began: On April 6, 1960, Lester D.

It manifests itself here in the state as a relation to other states, each of which is autonomous vis-a-vis the others...this negative relation of the state to itself is embodied in the world as the relation of one state to another and as if the negative were something external.30 <br/>Schmitt is important both for understanding the way in which such alienation is seen as <br/>AND<br/>it society is not political and a people cannot be said to exist:<br/>Only the actual participants can correctly recognise, understand and judge the concrete situation and settle the extreme case of conflict...to judge whether the adversary intends to negate his opponent’s way of life and therefore must be repulsed or fought in order to preserve one’s own form of existence.33<br/>Schmitt links this stark ontology to war when he states that the political is only <br/>AND<br/>enemy distinction’.34 War, in short, is an existential condition:<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the entire life of a human being is a struggle and every human being is symbolically a combatant. The friend, enemy and combat concepts receive their real meaning precisely because they refer to the real possibility of physical killing. War follows from enmity. War is the existential negation of the enemy.35<br/>Schmitt claims that his theory is not biased towards war as a choice (’It is by no means as though the political signifies nothing but devastating war and every political deed a military action...it neither favours war nor militarism, neither imperialism nor pacifism’) but it is hard to accept his caveat at face value.36<br/>When such a theory takes the form of a social discourse (which it does <br/>AND<br/>ontologies of war join into a closed circle of mutual support and justification.<br/>This closed circle of existential and strategic reason generates a number of dangers. Firstly<br/>AND<br/>Israeli-Arab conflict, are arguably examples of such ontologies in action.<br/>Secondly, the militaristic force of such an ontology is visible, in Schmitt, in the absolute sense of vulnerability whereby a people can judge whether their ’adversary intends to negate his opponent’s way of life’.38 Evoking the kind of thinking that would become controversial in the Bush doctrine, Hegel similarly argues that:<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...a state may regard its infinity and honour as at stake in each <br/>AND<br/>addition as a cause of strife the idea of such an injury...39<br/>Identity, even more than physical security or autonomy, is put at stake in <br/>AND<br/>by conservatives to justify military adventurism and a rejectionist policy towards the Palestinians.<br/>On the reverse side of such ontologies of national insecurity we find pride and hubris, the belief that martial preparedness and action are vital or healthy for the existence of a people. Clausewitz’s thought is thoroughly imbued with this conviction. For example, his definition of war as an act of policy does not refer merely to the policy of cabinets, but expresses the objectives and will of peoples:<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When whole communities go to war — whole peoples, and especially civilized peoples — the reason always lies in some political situation and the occasion is always due to some political object. War, therefore, is an act of policy.42<br/>Such a perspective prefigures Schmitt’s definition of the ’political’ (an earlier translation reads ’war<br/>AND<br/>merges the existential and rationalistic conceptions of war into a theoretical unity.44<br/>The idea that national identities could be built and redeemed through war derived from the <br/>AND<br/>time to time to shake them to the very centre by war’.46<br/>The historian Azar Gat points to the similarity of Clausewitz’s arguments that ’a people and <br/>AND<br/>than cool political reason...war is a major aspect of being.’48<br/>Hegel’s text argues that war is ’a work of freedom’ in which ’the individual’s substantive duty’ merges with the ’independence and sovereignty of the state’.49 Through war, he argues,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the ethical health of peoples is preserved in their indifference to the stabilization of finite institutions; just as the blowing of the winds preserves the sea from the foulness which would be the result of a prolonged calm, so the corruption in nations would be the product of a prolonged, let alone ’perpetual’ peace.50 <br/>Hegel indeed argues that ’sacrifice on behalf of the individuality of the state is a <br/>AND<br/>realisation in which the individual dissolves into the higher unity of the state:<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intrinsic worth of courage as a disposition of mind is to be found <br/>AND<br/>an attitude of complete indifference or even liking towards them as individuals.52<br/>A more frank statement of the potentially lethal consequences of patriotism — and its simultaneously <br/>AND<br/>war and the social contract in the form of the national security state.<br/>Strategic Reason and Scientific Truth<br/>By itself, such an account of the nationalist ontology of war and security provides <br/>AND<br/>a machinic process of which war and violence are viewed as normal features.<br/>These are the deeper claims and implications of Clausewitzian strategic reason. One of the <br/>AND<br/>, removed technical limits from the exercise of power in foreign policy’.55<br/>Kissinger’s conviction was based not merely in his pride in the vast military and bureaucratic <br/>AND<br/>view that the real world is almost entirely internal to the observer’.56<br/>At the same time, Kissinger’s hubris and hunger for control was beset by a <br/>AND<br/>hunger for stasis and certainty that would entrench U.S. hegemony:<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the two decades after 1945, our international activities were based on the <br/>AND<br/>multipolarity even though overwhelming military strength will remain with the two superpowers.58 <br/>Kissinger’s statement revealed that such cravings for order and certainty continually confront chaos, resistance <br/>AND<br/>with a deeply controversial and divisive war to remove Saddam Hussein from power.<br/>In this struggle with the lessons of Vietnam, revolutionary resistance, and rapid geopolitical <br/>AND<br/>associated rationality...does not inevitably produce a similar concept of reality’.61<br/>We sense the rational policymaker’s frustrated desire: the world is supposed to work like a machine, ordered by a form of power and governmental reason which deploys machines and whose desires and processes are meant to run along ordered, rational lines like a machine. Kissinger’s desire was little different from that of Cromer who, wrote Edward Said:<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...envisions a seat of power in the West and radiating out from it towards the East a great embracing machine, sustaining the central authority yet commanded by it. What the machine’s branches feed into it from the East — human material, material wealth, knowledge, what have you — is processed by the machine, then converted into more power...the immediate translation of mere Oriental matter into useful substance.62<br/>This desire for order in the shadow of chaos and uncertainty — the constant war <br/>AND<br/>an exclusively quantitative analysis could science attain certain knowledge of the world’.65<br/>Such doctrines of mathematically verifiable truth were to have powerful echoes in the 20th Century<br/>AND<br/>control of the weapons themselves, into political utility and rational strategy.66<br/>Bacon thought of the new scientific method not merely as way of achieving a purer <br/>AND<br/>, that man may be said to be a god unto man’.68<br/>We may be forgiven for blinking, but in Bacon’s thought ’man’ was indeed in the process of stealing a new fire from the heavens and seizing God’s power over the world for itself. Not only would the new empirical science lead to ’an improvement of mankind’s estate, and an increase in their power over nature’, but would reverse the primordial humiliation of the Fall of Adam:<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For man, by the fall, lost at once his state of innocence<br/>AND<br/>ceremonies) at length to afford mankind in some degree his bread...69<br/>There is a breathtaking, world-creating hubris in this statement — one that<br/>AND<br/>inventions are a blessing and a benefit without injuring or afflicting any’.70<br/>And what would be mankind’s ’bread’, the rewards of its new ’empire over creation’<br/>AND<br/>much as enlightenment; the destruction of nature as much as its utilisation.<br/>Doubts and Fears: Technology as Ontology<br/>If Bacon could not reasonably be expected to foresee many of these developments, the idea that scientific and technological progress could be destructive did occur to him. However it was an anxiety he summarily dismissed:<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...let none be alarmed at the objection of the arts and sciences becoming depraved to malevolent or luxurious purposes and the like, for the same can be said of every worldly good; talent, courage, strength, beauty, riches, light itself...Only let mankind regain their rights over nature, assigned to them by the gift of God, and obtain that power, whose exercise will be governed by right reason and true religion.71<br/>By the mid-Twentieth Century, after the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, such fears could no longer be so easily wished away, as the physicist and scientific director of the Manhattan Project, J. Robert Oppenheimer recognised. He said in a 1947 lecture:<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We felt a particularly intimate responsibility for suggesting, for supporting and in the end in large measure achieving the realization of atomic weapons...In some sort of crude sense which no vulgarity, no humor, no over-statement can quite extinguish, the physicists have known sin, and this is a knowledge they cannot lose.72<br/>Adam had fallen once more, but into a world which refused to acknowledge its <br/>AND<br/>and Descartes’ faith in mathematics to make of the Bomb a rational weapon.<br/>Oppenheimer — who resolutely opposed the development of the hydrogen bomb — understood what the <br/>AND<br/>an unmooring quality; it finds men unprepared to deal with it.’75<br/>Martin Heidegger questioned this mapping of natural science onto the social world in his essays <br/>AND<br/>of science for politics, knowledge for force, or force for good.<br/>Instead, Oppenheimer saw a process frustrated by roadblocks and ruptured by irony; in <br/>AND<br/>political certainty; it turns control over ’facts’ into control over the earth.<br/>Heidegger’s insights into this phenomena I find especially telling and disturbing — because they underline <br/>AND<br/>technology. The actual threat has already affected man in his essence.’77<br/>This process Heidegger calls ’Enframing’ and through it the scientific mind demands that ’nature reports <br/>AND<br/>human lives are reduced to tools, obstacles, useful or obstinate matter.<br/>This tells us much about the enduring power of crude instrumental versions of strategic thought<br/>AND<br/>of the sand and take action toward shutting down Hezbollah-land.’81<br/>Conclusion: Violent Ontologies or Peaceful Choices?<br/>I was motivated to begin the larger project from which this essay derives by a <br/>AND<br/>fail to question the ontological claims of political community or strategic theory.82<br/>In the case of a theorist like Jean Bethke Elshtain, just war doctrine is <br/>AND<br/>destructive and violent way of acknowledging and dealing with conflict and difference.85<br/>My argument here, whilst normatively sympathetic to Kant’s moral demand for the eventual abolition <br/>AND<br/>revealing and hence to experience the call of a more primal truth.’87<br/>What I take from Heidegger’s argument — one that I have sought to extend by <br/>AND<br/>and violence as necessary policy responses, however ineffective, dysfunctional or chaotic.<br/>The force of my own and Heidegger’s analysis does, admittedly, tend towards a <br/>AND<br/>are certainly tremendously aggressive and energetic in continually stating and reinstating its force.<br/>But is there a way out? Is there no possibility of agency and choice<br/>AND<br/>us valuable clues to the kind of sensibility needed, but little more.<br/>When we consider the problem of policy, the force of this analysis suggests that <br/>AND<br/>and activating a very different concept of existence, security and action.90<br/>This would seem to hinge upon ’questioning’ as such — on the questions we put <br/>AND<br/>to end the global rule of insecurity and violence?

This book explores and accounts for their distinctiveness.<br/>The evidence presented in the next chapters has direct implications for three topics of much <br/>AND<br/>. The focus on RTAs brings new evidence to bear on these issues.<br/>The specific focus of the book is on two major areas of difference among RTAs<br/>AND<br/>labels should list all ingredients, or racial discrimination in hiring is acceptable.<br/>Regional market building poses special challenges. Historically, most markets have formed slowly over <br/>AND<br/>it requires fundamental changes in subtle and sometimes implicit notions about the world.<br/>RTA officials have responded differently to this challenge. In some areas, they have <br/>AND<br/>, if problems arise, to turn to reactive conflict-resolution mechanisms.<br/>RTAs differ not only in the complexity of their legal architectures but also in the <br/>AND<br/>labor, medical conditions, and the use of food additives quite differently.<br/>The second claim concerns the responses of societal organizations to regional integration. Different interest <br/>AND<br/>, the expansion of furniture manufacturers, and the internationalization of transportation departments.<br/>In some cases, analogous organizations develop regional structures and programs across different RTAs. But those cases still see important differences across those organizations in terms of specific structures and programs. If, for instance, farmers emerge at the regional level in two RTAs, their members’ profiles and their objectives are likely to vary. Similarly, if textile companies expand internationally in two given RTAs, what exactly they produce will differ.<br/>What helps explain these differences in law and organizational developments? The Social Construction of <br/>AND<br/>the grounds in the member states and that RTAs acquire their distinctive character.<br/>Specifically, in the case of interventionism versus minimalism in regional law, the presence <br/>AND<br/>, and so on) that have flourished in those dominant regulatory environments.<br/>As to the targets and content of regional law, we consider again existing legal <br/>AND<br/>boundaries of the permissible, the final character of any given regional law.<br/>Organizational changes in RTAs also reflect existing institutional and political contexts. Those organizations that <br/>AND<br/>area, organizations adapt by expanding their operations in tandem with such law.<br/>The evidence for these claims concerns three RTAs in Europe and the Americas: the <br/>AND<br/>important notions surrounding labor rights, yet their definitions and visions vary significantly.<br/>We will then consider the evolution of three types of organizations in the same three <br/>AND<br/>, crucially, that those units and processes are particular to each RTA.<br/>The argument and evidence presented in this book directly challenge the recent writing of a <br/>AND<br/>the local as a place of difference. Three strands are especially important.<br/>Some proponents of globalization suggest that the world is becoming an increasingly homogenous place. <br/>AND<br/>, offer similar examples (Arrighi 2000; Burtless et al. 2000).<br/>A second set of globalization theorists point to increased international cooperation. As human communities <br/>AND<br/>nation state are being eroded in favor of a global, cosmopolitan system.<br/>A third group of proponents acknowledges that the world remains full of variation and idiosyncrasies<br/>AND<br/>people are well aware of events and systems outside of their small country.<br/>This book challenges these visions of a global world, and especially those related to <br/>AND<br/>either be untenable or still only be achieved quite far into the future.<br/>This book naturally aligns itself with the critics of the globalization thesis.

This view that the state and war came into existence in a symbiosis is expressed in Montesquieu’s dictum –<br/>"once in a political society, men lose their feeling of weakness whereupon their former equality disappears and the state of war begins"~4~.<br/>This is a convincing account of war’s origins. The "state" enables war <br/>AND<br/>developments in weapons technology, began the process of consolidating "nation states".<br/>War has had a massive influence upon the world we know, however this should not lead us to see the state and war as partners in a relationship which is necessarily equal to each. The dependence of the state upon war/conflict is not logically necessary. Even if both arose together and even if the state depended upon war to establish itself, the relationship is not necessarily perpetual. Nevertheless, ’realism’ would dispute this claim.<br/>REALISM<br/>Following the demise of Liberal idealism, scholars such as George Kennan, Walter Lippman <br/>AND<br/>power, the international system as its stage and states as its actors.<br/>Morgenthau would attempt to extrapolate a science of international politics from this ’practical guide’<br/>AND<br/>"power" and "conflict" are essential to understand realism’s development.<br/>Neo-realism emerged from a critique of "political realism" positing that "<br/>AND<br/>. To illustrate this point Waltz used the "oligopolistic market" analogy -<br/>"within an oligopolistic market, the ability of firms to arrive at some convergence regarding prices… cannot be adequately understood either by examining negotiations among the firms or by studying their internal decision making process. Rather it is the structure of the market itself, in which a few key actors collectively hold the dominant market share… the tendency for competition is dampened through mutual adjustments over time"~10~<br/>In the same way, state behaviour cannot be explained by internal characteristics, but is determined by the structure of the international system which (like other ’structures’) varies across three dimensions:<br/>&nbsp;"by their ordering principles, the specification of functions of formally differentiated parts and the relative capabilities of the units"~11~.<br/>States are "ordered" by the principle of anarchy and "function" as rational power maximisers. The only remaining difference amongst states is their "relative capabilities" (power) International Relations becomes limited to analyzing the relative power between states. Changing power configurations can affect alignment and levels of conflict. Nevertheless, in an anarchic world order, competing sovereign states with different levels of power create conflict and war, which is seen as inevitable amongst sovereign states.<br/>REALISM’S EPISTEMOLOGY<br/>A great part of the difference between those who see war as a necessary and <br/>AND<br/>to enquiry into circumstances/events which bring about system transformation~12~.<br/>Realism’s synchronic understanding of history views the international system as essentially unchanging, enabling the <br/>AND<br/>data", Robert Cox points out this has negative effects on neorealist historicism;<br/>"There can be no dispute about Kenneth Waltz’s adherence to the positivist approach … &nbsp;the elegance he achieves in the clarity of his theoretical statement comes at the price of an unconvincing mode of historical understanding" &nbsp;Robert Cox~13~<br/>Neorealism’s positivist approach eliminates subjectivity from consideration. Therefore, the event observed – war<br/>AND<br/>the international system, realism amputates from itself a key area of analysis.<br/>Clear gaps in realist theory become apparent. For example realism would analyse "Imperialist <br/>AND<br/>international system itself, not the nature of the units which constitute it.<br/>In order to account for research that has clearly favored dyadic over systemic explanations for <br/>AND<br/>a theory is more likely to fundamentally reshape neorealism rather than complement it.<br/>Realism is essentially a-historical, its positivist epistemology degenerates history into "a mine of data illustrating the permutations and combinations that are possible within an essentially unchanging human story"~18~. Moreover, by limiting itself to analysing the structure and the effect, realism eliminates from analysis the impact subjective actors (states) have upon war and ignores the fact that changes in societal organization affect war.<br/>An understanding of history as a process enables analysis on the effects different conditions and different forms of state have upon war. This lends itself to a rejection of positivism and adoption of "critical theory"~19~ where the role of philosophy is to change the world, not merely to interpret it-<br/>"The real social function of philosophy lies in its criticism of what is prevalent … the chief aim of such criticism is to prevent mankind from losing itself in those ideas and activities which the existing organization of society instills into its members" Max Horkheimer~20~<br/>Realism may not be "losing itself" in presently hegemonic ideas, a synchronic <br/>AND<br/>from it, ignoring the fact that changes in societal organization affect war.<br/>This condemns realism to the conclusion that war is an inevitable and immutable part of <br/>AND<br/>, significantly reducing, or at least preventing the tragedy that is war.<br/>Accusations of futile utopianism will surely be made against such a claim.

The threat posed by these networks can only be countered through coordinated efforts across producing, consuming, and transshipment countries, all of which have a shared interest in controlling the flow of <br/>arms, money, vehicles, and drugs. The process of combating and adapting to climate change also exemplifies the need for a hemispheric partnership. All carbon-emitting societies contribute to the problem to different degrees, and all will experience its consequences. The solutions—ranging from developing alternative fuels to adapting to ecological shocks—all require sustained cooperation among the hemisphere’s countries.&nbsp;</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HScenario1isImmigration2014" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Scenario 1 is Immigration —</span></h4><h4 id="HCooperativemeasurestowardreducingillegalimmigrationallowtheeffectiveallocationofresourcestowardcounter-terroristmeasures." class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Cooperative measures toward reducing illegal immigration allow the effective allocation of resources toward counter-terrorist measures.</span></h4><p><strong>Barry 13</strong> (Tom, January 9, 2013, Director for the TransBorder project at the Center for International Policy in Wash.

Developing countries and emerging economies are particularly affected. The reasons for this include their geographic location, the reduced ability of poorer countries to adapt to changing requirements, and their often strong economic dependency on particularly climate sensitive sectors such as agriculture.<br/>Climate change is already costing billions every year. Some economies could lose up to a fifth of their gross domestic product (GDP) as a result of climate damage. However, between 40 and 70 of this damage can be averted by timely adaptation measures.<br/>Rising sea levels mean a greater risk of flooding<br/>During the 20th century, sea levels rose by an average of 2 mm per <br/>AND<br/>coast lines, resulting in the destruction of infrastructure and valuable arable land.<br/>It is feared that a number of island states in the Pacific will largely be <br/>AND<br/>irrigation in agriculture. In addition, the saltwater also damages valuable farmland.<br/>Increasing occurrences of extreme weather events and higher risk of natural disasters<br/>The effects of climate change are clearly manifested by extreme weather events like flooding and tropical cyclones, whose strength is set to increase further still in many regions. This endangers human lives, infrastructures and ecosystems, thereby destroying the source of many people’s livelihoods.<br/>Increasing ocean temperatures are exceeding the threshold of 27 °C earlier and earlier in <br/>AND<br/>Pakistan in the summer of 2010 which affected more than 15 million people.<br/>Scientists also believe that heat waves and heavy rain events will occur more frequently. Heat waves can cause significant health hazards particularly in large cities. In add-ition, tropical diseases like malaria will spread to more and more regions as a result of rising temperatures.<br/>More frequent heavy rain events will ag-gravate the problem of soil erosion in many parts of the world. This in turn leads to increased and more severe river flooding and represents a major challenge for flood protection, urban drainage, the effective-ness of sewage treatment plants and the protection of settlements against landslides and mudslides.<br/>A gradual threat<br/>Storms and floods are spectacular conse-quen ces of climate change which are immediately apparent. However, it is the more gradual changes of temperature and precipitation patterns which will probably be more significant in the long run. In many regions, the quantity of rainfall is already scarcely enough for the supply of drinking water as well as for agriculture or forestry, or for use in the production of energy and in the manufacturing industry.<br/>In many cases it can be expected that due to climate change this situation will worsen. In the regions around the Mediterranean, Southern Africa, north-eastern parts of Brazil and Central America, experts anticipate water availability to decline in some cases by over 20 by the end of the century. As a conse-quence, drinking water will become scarce, long-term efforts to combat desertification will be endangered, and ecosystems will be permanently damaged or even destroyed.<br/>Scientists fear that the decline in water avail-ability in some rainforest regions, which are of significant importance for global biodiversity, will result in a shift in the variety of species and cause important species to become extinct.<br/>Another gradual but very real consequence is the melting of glaciers, particular in the <br/>AND<br/>impact on drinking water supplies, agri-culture and hydroelectric power generation.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HBiodiversitylosscausesextinction." class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Biodiversity loss causes extinction.</span></h4><p>Suurküla 06 - Chairman of Physicians and Scientists (Jaan, M.D., for Responsible Application of Science and Technology (PSRAST), "World-wide cooperation required to prevent global crisis; Part one— the problem", Physicians and Scientists for Responsible Application of Science and Technology, 6/24, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.globalissues.org/article/171/loss-of-biodiversity-and-extinctions)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.globalissues.org/article/171/loss-of-biodiversity-and-extinctions)%27" tppabs="http://www.globalissues.org/article/171/loss-of-biodiversity-and-extinctions)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.globalissues.org/article/171/loss-of-biodiversity-and-extinctions)</span></a></span></p><p>The world environmental situation is likely to be further aggravated by the increasingly rapid, <br/>AND<br/>coming 50 years.

The State Department’s Oct. 1 fact sheet says the U.S. must dismantle 109 of its deployed ICBMs, deployed submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) and deployed heavy bombers, and remove another 138 warheads.<br/>Heritage notes the U.S. has already reduced its deployed warheads by 112 and that destroying an ICBM squadron to comply with New START is unnecessary.<br/>Further cuts, if needed, could be made by removing the missiles and placing the silos in reserve status.<br/>The document says the reductions are necessary to "meet the New START Treaty compliance date by closing an ICBM squadron and eliminating the associated Launch Facilities." But that’s not true. New START does not require destruction of the silos.<br/>So why the unnecessary move to cut our offensive missile deterrent force after the administration has scrapped Phase IV of our European-based missile defense, which was the proposed replacement for the ground-based interceptors and missile radars that were scuttled in a betrayal of our Polish and Czech allies?<br/>The president has said he dreams of a world without nuclear weapons, which critics point out seems to mean only a world without U.S. nukes.<br/>He sees U.S. military supremacy as an anachronistic example of the American exceptionalism for which he has apologized so many times.<br/>To that end, in his June 2013 Berlin speech, President Obama spoke of his desire to unilaterally reduce deployed U.S. nuclear forces by up to one-third.</p><h4 id="HPlan2019skeytoObamacred." class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Plan’s key to Obama cred.</span></h4><p>Boudin 9 (Chesa, Rhodes Scholar with degrees from Yale and Oxford Universities.

Boehner of Ohio has insisted recently that immigration reform is not dead, the House is about to finish the year without progress on a topic that is a priority to Latino voters, an electorate the GOP desperately needs to woo before the next presidential race.<br/>In fact, the House’s most visible immigration-related action was a measure to defund an Obama administration program to defer deportations of young immigrants, a vote that increased Latino animosity even though it failed to become law.<br/>The legislative sputter stems from Republicans’ focus on the 2014 midterm election. As lawmakers burnish their conservative credentials for potential hard-right primary challenges, they are betting they will have time to court Latinos before the 2016 election.<br/>But the inaction raises questions about whether Republicans have learned from their electoral losses last year and can broaden the party’s base to appeal to more minorities. And it’s not only immigration reform. GOP promises to be more inclusive to women and gays also have produced few results.<br/>"It’s foolhardy," said Alex Nowrasteh, a policy analyst at the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute. "On the one hand, Republicans have improved their rhetoric and they’ve moved much more toward embracing immigration reform. On the other hand, immigration reform was passed in the Senate and was dropped in the House of Representatives, and that makes them look like they’re opposed to reform, which in a way, they are."<br/>In last year’s presidential election, Mitt Romney — whose comment about "self-deportation" infuriated immigration advocates — lost the Latino vote by a 44-percentage-point margin, the largest deficit of any Republican presidential candidate since the Clinton era. Alarmed GOP insiders jump-started congressional talks toward a bipartisan immigration overhaul, and Boehner announced the time had come for Congress to act.<br/>But the speaker has refused to take up the Senate’s sweeping bipartisan overhaul of immigration laws, even though it would probably pass the House with Democratic support; nor are House Republicans expected to vote on their own measures any time soon.<br/>Divisions within the House GOP have left the party at a standstill. More Republican lawmakers than ever — nearly two dozen, by some counts — support the cornerstone of an immigration overhaul, which is a path to citizenship for immigrants in the U.S. illegally.<br/>But many more oppose legalization efforts. Most House Republicans represent conservative districts, configured to include few minority voters. The handful of exceptions, including several from California, have already come under pressure in their districts, but most have little interest in the subject.<br/>"There’s just no cohesion there yet," said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who has tried to persuade Republicans to take action. "All I hope is that they realize that the issue is not going away — that we need to act on it — that we’d be glad to consider any proposals or ideas they have."<br/>Hedging the political risks, House GOP leaders continue working behind the scenes with lawmakers to draft a series of bills that could be brought forward next year.<br/>Together, they would resemble the main ingredients of the comprehensive Senate bill.<br/>One, from Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia, would provide a path to citizenship for young people brought to the U.S. illegally as minors. Another would allow adult immigrants to apply for legal status as border security is ramped up.<br/>President Obama has extended a hand to Boehner several times by saying he would be open to the House GOP’s piecemeal approach rather than the Senate’s big package.<br/>"It’s Thanksgiving; we can carve that bird into multiple pieces," Obama said during a speech in San Francisco on Monday. "A drumstick here, breast meat there.

Of the deal, then British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain declared his infamous phrase, "Peace for our time." A year later, Adolf Hitler invaded Poland, revealing the folly of Chamberlain and his allies’ appeasement policy.<br/>"Winds of Munich are blowing from Geneva," Israeli Tourism Minister Uzi Landau told the Jerusalem Post. Right-wing Member of Knesset Moshe Feiglin wrote, "The Iranian version of the Munich Agreement was just signed in Geneva. Like Czechoslovakia in 1938, which was not party to the Western powers’’ discussions that effectively brought about its demise<sub>&nbsp;Israel today watches from the sidelines as its existential interest is being sacrificed by the West."<br/>Member of Knesset Ayelet Shaked said, "As Chamberlain said: Everything would have been alright if Hitler hadn’t lied to me."<br/>Besides the Israeli politicians, an array of conservative American voices has been invoking the words "Munich," "appeasement" and "Chamberlain" as analogies for the Obama administration’s quest for a deal with Iran, while bloggers have been posting side-by-side photos of the Geneva and Munich meetings and photo-shopped images of Obama and Chamberlain.<br/>"Nothing good happens late at night, and America just had a modern-day Neville Chamberlain moment," former Congressman Allen West wrote.<br/>"President Obama has just empowered the number one state sponsor of terrorism, Iran, to pursue its nuclear goals and objectives," West added. "This is not diplomacy, this is abject surrender and appeasement. Iran loses nothing, not a single facility, not any capability to enrich uranium, but we have conceded the one best non-military option: economic sanctions."</sub></p><h4 id="HBothcasestudiesandquantitativestudiesdisproveyourshenanigans." class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Both case studies and quantitative studies disprove your shenanigans.</span></h4><p><strong>Huth</strong> <strong>97</strong> Paul, Autumn.

This paper will further define our interests in Cuba and why President Obama should continue his quest for renewed diplomatic relations with Cuba. It will discuss potential risks associated with retaining the current 50-year diplomatic policy and give some broad suggestions regarding a new U.S. – Cuba foreign policy.<br/>Policy and National Interest<br/>Present U.S. policy towards Cuba is economic isolation imposed via embargo to <br/>AND<br/>Cuba policy, past opportunities and ultimate failure over the past 50 years. <br/>From 1959 to1964, beginning with President Eisenhower but shaped primarily by the Kennedy Administration<br/>AND<br/>by 1974, 45 of Cuba’s exports came from western governments.7<br/>The period 1965-1972, although officially endorsing the previous administration’s tough stance, <br/>AND<br/>" in 1980 intensified this opposition and quickly derailed Carter’s initiatives in Congress.<br/>As President Reagan took office in 1980, U.S. – Cuba relations <br/>AND<br/>Administrations made no significant concessions to Cuba and status quo between countries remained. <br/>The last meaningful opportunity for change occurred after the fall of the Berlin Wall and <br/>AND<br/>allow third country U.S. companies from trading with Cuba.15<br/>By the time President Clinton came to office, momentum had already shifted in Cuba’s <br/>AND<br/>tighten the noose failed terribly and only succeeded in further alienating both governments.<br/>The second Bush Administration did little to engage Cuba and after September 11, 2001, was completely engrossed in the War on Terror. U.S. policy towards Cuba has changed little in 50 years. Although the embargo continues to fail despite our best efforts to tighten it, our policy has remained steadfast and the U.S. is no closer to normalizing relations with Cuba.<br/>A History of Anger and Distrust<br/>After 50 years, deep-seated distrust and anger exists between the U.<br/>AND<br/>conditions for diplomatic success in future U.S. – Cuba relations. <br/>Experts argue over who’s started the dispute between nations: was it the Cuban Agrarian <br/>AND<br/>encourage the long-term changes U.S. wants in Cuba. <br/>The embargo itself remains a perpetual albatross that continues to undermine any real diplomatic progress <br/>AND<br/>.S. had succeeded in isolating Cuba from its western traders.20<br/>Tightening the noose placed extraordinary economic pressure on Cuba considering U.S. multilateral <br/>AND<br/>, and Asian countries participated in Cuba’s largest ever annual trade fair."26<br/>Castro’s interest in improving U.S. - Cuba relations was perhaps the greatest <br/>AND<br/>now largely ineffective bilateral embargo served only to increase animosity between both countries.<br/>It is difficult to quantify, but essential to note, that U.S<br/>AND<br/>U.S. national interests and not the legacy of Fidel Castro.<br/>Another important pitfall is to exploit democracy as a precondition for diplomacy and economic engagement <br/>AND<br/>28 The recommendation then focuses largely on steps to pursue a democratic Cuba. <br/>To separate security and stability from democratic pursuits in Cuba could benefit both causes. <br/>AND<br/>generation to open dialogue with Cuba without the democratic preconditions tied to negotiations. <br/>As we pursue diplomatic relations with Cuba we should not expect full disclosure, immediate <br/>AND<br/>is needed until Cuba has the confidence to commit to further diplomatic relations. <br/>Current U.S.-Cuba Policy Analysis<br/>Understanding the deep-seated animosity and distrust that continues to fuel U.S. - Cuba tensions will aid us in properly analyzing the feasibility, acceptability and suitability (FAS) of current and future U.S. policy with Cuba. Identifying FAS applications to diplomacy, information, military, economic, finance, intelligence and law enforcement (DIME-FIL) will highlight weaknesses in current U.S. – Cuba relations that can be modified for future improvement. <br/>The logical question with regards to current U.S. – Cuba policy is <br/>AND<br/>. to pursue the current course there is no evidence it will succeed.<br/>How acceptable is it to U.S. foreign policy? There are three <br/>AND<br/>. acceptability is necessary to achieve U.S. ends in Cuba.<br/>Several embargo refinements over the years like the Libertad Act have further tightened restrictions on <br/>AND<br/>, our efforts to impose embargo restrictions are unacceptable tradeoffs for homeland security.<br/>In the final analysis, U.S. – Cuba policy is not sustainable <br/>AND<br/>foregone diplomatic engagement and chosen coercive economic power as our only political tool.<br/>Does Cuba Pose A Security Threat to the U.S.?<br/>Let’s begin by asking this question: can we afford to escort commerce through Caribbean <br/>AND<br/>are definite advantages to having healthy regional partnerships to deal with regional problems. <br/>While economic pressure has failed to bring about government change, it could trigger a <br/>AND<br/>not exist for real change in U.S. – Cuba relations.<br/>Proposed U.S.-Cuba Policy Analysis<br/>If today marks President Obama’s "new strategy" towards Cuba we must begin with U.S. National interests in the broader Latin American context. Over the past 50 years our approach has been germane to Cuba and not the larger Latin American construct. In so doing we have isolated Cuba from Latin America for coercive reasons yes, but also for the very democratic principles we hoped Cuba would follow. <br/>The State Department’s Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs (covers Canada and Cuba) has <br/>AND<br/>conditions and exposing them to the democratic enticements we hope they will emulate.<br/>Achieving Congressional approval will be difficult although not impossible in the present economic recession. <br/>AND<br/>these to the American public before the media or his opposition defines these.<br/>We’ve established that coercive means have failed to achieve democracy and economic stability in Cuba<br/>AND<br/>U.S. shepherding, lead them to a more representative government. <br/>If we accept that reestablishing relations with Cuba is the first real step to a <br/>AND<br/>to allow time to reap success or mitigate failure before the next elections.<br/>The U.S. cannot afford to miss another opportunity to normalize relations with Cuba. A Cuba without Fidel is an opportunity – whether it is Raul or his replacement in 2013. The U.S. must lay the foundation today for renewed U.S. Cuba relations. Delaying could also signal the contrary to Raul Castro suspiciously awaiting the true purpose of recent U.S. concessions.<br/>While a long term goal may be to influence change in government, it cannot <br/>AND<br/>the restoration of trust that must occur before complete reciprocation can be expected.<br/>Conclusion<br/>Today, 20 years have passed since the fall of the Berlin Wall – it’s <br/>AND<br/>Cuba. Under these conditions, diplomacy has a better chance to flourish. <br/>If the Cuban model succeeds President Obama will be seen as a true leader for <br/>AND<br/>decline in the greater global order bringing true peace for years to come.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HChangingCubapolicyuniquelykey2013it2019shighlysymbolicoftheUSattitudetowardstheentireregion" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Changing Cuba policy uniquely key – it’s highly symbolic of the US attitude towards the entire region</span></h4><p><strong>Sweig and Bustamante 13</strong> - Nelson and David Rockefeller Senior Fellow for Latin America Studies and Director for Latin America Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations; Ph.D. candidate in Latin American history at Yale University (Julia E. and Michael J, &nbsp;Cuba After Communism, Foreign Affairs, Jul/Aug2013, Vol. 92, Issue 4</p><p>The geopolitical context in Latin America provides another reason the U.S. government <br/>AND<br/>people and U.S. national interests would benefit as a result.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HThatbolstersinfluence-allowingtheUStoleadmultilateralforums-Latinrelationsuniquelykeytoeffectiveleverage" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>That bolsters influence-allowing the US to lead multilateral forums- Latin relations uniquely key to effective leverage</span></h4><p>Sabatini and Berger 12 – Christopher Sabatini is editor-in-chief of Americas Quarterly and senior director of policy at Americas Society/Council of the Americas.

In March Russian state-owned oil major Rosneft said it would triple supplies to China to 1 million barrels a day.<br/>This is just the latest in a string of China-Russia energy negotiations, with an

this one to Congress, the administration jeopardizes our national security with plans to eliminate an entire squadron of intercontinental ballistic missiles and destroy its silos.<br/>Yet another example of what President Obama meant in 2012 when he promised Russian President Dmitry Medvedev at the Nuclear Security Summit in Seoul, South Korea, that after his re-election he would have more "flexibility" on defense issues, comes on the news that an ICBM squadron would be scrapped to comply with the New START Treaty — even as both the Russians and Chinese deploy new ballistic missiles.<br/>A document prepared by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and obtained by the Washington Free Beacon maps out a strategy to eliminate an ICBM squadron — and destroy its missile silos — by Dec. 5, 2017.<br/>The military would begin removing ICBMs next October, after an environmental assessment is complete, and the silo elimination would begin in May 2016.<br/>The fact is, as the Heritage Foundation notes, the U.S. does not need to eliminate an ICBM squadron to meet New START’s limits. The State Department’s Oct. 1 fact sheet says the U.S. must dismantle 109 of its deployed ICBMs, deployed submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) and deployed heavy bombers, and remove another 138 warheads.<br/>Heritage notes the U.S. has already reduced its deployed warheads by 112 and that destroying an ICBM squadron to comply with New START is unnecessary.<br/>Further cuts, if needed, could be made by removing the missiles and placing the silos in reserve status.<br/>The document says the reductions are necessary to "meet the New START Treaty compliance date by closing an ICBM squadron and eliminating the associated Launch Facilities." But that’s not true. New START does not require destruction of the silos.<br/>So why the unnecessary move to cut our offensive missile deterrent force after the administration has scrapped Phase IV of our European-based missile defense, which was the proposed replacement for the ground-based interceptors and missile radars that were scuttled in a betrayal of our Polish and Czech allies?<br/>The president has said he dreams of a world without nuclear weapons, which critics point out seems to mean only a world without U.S. nukes.<br/>He sees U.S. military supremacy as an anachronistic example of the American exceptionalism for which he has apologized so many times.<br/>To that end, in his June 2013 Berlin speech, President Obama spoke of his desire to unilaterally reduce deployed U.S. nuclear forces by up to one-third.</p><h4 id="HObama2019sappeasingCubanow" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Obama’s appeasing Cuba now</span></h4><p>Diaz-Balart ’12 (Rep.

Boehner of Ohio has insisted recently that immigration reform is not dead, the House is about to finish the year without progress on a topic that is a priority to Latino voters, an electorate the GOP desperately needs to woo before the next presidential race.<br/>In fact, the House’s most visible immigration-related action was a measure to defund an Obama administration program to defer deportations of young immigrants, a vote that increased Latino animosity even though it failed to become law.<br/>The legislative sputter stems from Republicans’ focus on the 2014 midterm election. As lawmakers burnish their conservative credentials for potential hard-right primary challenges, they are betting they will have time to court Latinos before the 2016 election.<br/>But the inaction raises questions about whether Republicans have learned from their electoral losses last year and can broaden the party’s base to appeal to more minorities. And it’s not only immigration reform. GOP promises to be more inclusive to women and gays also have produced few results.<br/>"It’s foolhardy," said Alex Nowrasteh, a policy analyst at the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute. "On the one hand, Republicans have improved their rhetoric and they’ve moved much more toward embracing immigration reform. On the other hand, immigration reform was passed in the Senate and was dropped in the House of Representatives, and that makes them look like they’re opposed to reform, which in a way, they are."<br/>In last year’s presidential election, Mitt Romney — whose comment about "self-deportation" infuriated immigration advocates — lost the Latino vote by a 44-percentage-point margin, the largest deficit of any Republican presidential candidate since the Clinton era. Alarmed GOP insiders jump-started congressional talks toward a bipartisan immigration overhaul, and Boehner announced the time had come for Congress to act.<br/>But the speaker has refused to take up the Senate’s sweeping bipartisan overhaul of immigration laws, even though it would probably pass the House with Democratic support; nor are House Republicans expected to vote on their own measures any time soon.<br/>Divisions within the House GOP have left the party at a standstill. More Republican lawmakers than ever — nearly two dozen, by some counts — support the cornerstone of an immigration overhaul, which is a path to citizenship for immigrants in the U.S. illegally.<br/>But many more oppose legalization efforts. Most House Republicans represent conservative districts, configured to include few minority voters. The handful of exceptions, including several from California, have already come under pressure in their districts, but most have little interest in the subject.<br/>"There’s just no cohesion there yet," said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who has tried to persuade Republicans to take action. "All I hope is that they realize that the issue is not going away — that we need to act on it — that we’d be glad to consider any proposals or ideas they have."<br/>Hedging the political risks, House GOP leaders continue working behind the scenes with lawmakers to draft a series of bills that could be brought forward next year.<br/>Together, they would resemble the main ingredients of the comprehensive Senate bill.<br/>One, from Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia, would provide a path to citizenship for young people brought to the U.S. illegally as minors. Another would allow adult immigrants to apply for legal status as border security is ramped up.<br/>President Obama has extended a hand to Boehner several times by saying he would be open to the House GOP’s piecemeal approach rather than the Senate’s big package.<br/>"It’s Thanksgiving; we can carve that bird into multiple pieces," Obama said during a speech in San Francisco on Monday. "A drumstick here, breast meat there. But as long as all the pieces get done — soon — and we actually deliver on the core values we’ve been talking about for so long, I think everybody is fine with it."<br/>House Republicans, though, have resisted most White House initiatives. Many Republicans prefer to use the months ahead investigating what went wrong with the healthcare law. And some House members seem to have missed the memo on new talking points.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HNocyberterror." class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>No cyberterror.</span></h4><p>Libicki, 8/16 -

Of the deal, then British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain declared his infamous phrase, "Peace for our time." A year later, Adolf Hitler invaded Poland, revealing the folly of Chamberlain and his allies’ appeasement policy.<br/>"Winds of Munich are blowing from Geneva," Israeli Tourism Minister Uzi Landau told the Jerusalem Post. Right-wing Member of Knesset Moshe Feiglin wrote, "The Iranian version of the Munich Agreement was just signed in Geneva.

Our euphemism for these people and their societies is ’’underdeveloped.’’1<br/>This ideology is not a facade masking sel?sh interests and, in particular, a <br/>AND<br/>revert to the aboriginal state in which Alvarado the Spaniard found it.’’2 <br/>The best way to begin—but only begin—to explain U.S<br/>AND<br/>States came to perceive Cuba’s revolutionary government as a threat to its interests. <br/>For three of the past ?ve decades, roughly from 1960 to 1990, the <br/>AND<br/>keep potential adversaries as far away as possible, and Cuba is close. <br/>’’We will bury you,’’ Nikita Khrushchev boasted in 1956, just as <br/>AND<br/>an unacceptable challenge to the primordial U.S. interest in security. <br/>The Cuban Revolution also attacked substantial economic interests. The U.S. government <br/>AND<br/>it—a full-court press by U.S. diplomats. <br/>But most investors of Robert Kleberg’s generation wrote off their losses decades ago, and <br/>AND<br/>Havana’s harbor. It was the ?rst signi?cant trade with Cuba since 1963. <br/>Cubans apparently liked what they bought, and soon the invisible hand of supply and <br/>AND<br/>business leaders hoping to convince Cubans to use their port for food shipments. <br/>These visits were but a prelude to the main event in 2003: a privately <br/>AND<br/>major market for U.S. corn, wheat and soybeans.’’4 <br/>So here we are, at a time when national security of?cials no longer have <br/>AND<br/>lose two; Florida has twenty-seven and will probably gain two). <br/>At ?rst, Cuban immigrants were politically impotent, but soon they began to take <br/>AND<br/>-fashioned way, with campaign contri- butions and bloc voting.6<br/>And CANF did this at a propitious moment: it had spent the 1980s honing <br/>AND<br/>is that we look to the rest of the world like idiots.’’8 <br/>Then came Elián González, the ?ve-year-old boy found clinging to <br/>AND<br/>W. Bush the presidency with a ?ve-vote electoral college margin. <br/>Since then, the question has been: When will Cuban Americans begin to vote <br/>AND<br/>imme- diately allow unlimited family travel and remittances to the island.’’<br/>When implemented in 2009, this relaxation of the embargo’s travel and remittance provisions more <br/>AND<br/>hijacked boat in the Straits of Florida and returned the hijackers to Cuba. <br/>Enough is enough, wrote ninety-eight prominent Cuban Americans, taking out an <br/>AND<br/>-line Cuban American base and probably contributed to his win in Florida. <br/>Both George Bush and Barack Obama understood the importance of Flor- ida’s Cuban Americans<br/>AND<br/>up on family visits and remit- tances. And he won Florida. <br/>So where is U.S. policy heading? Given the torpor that has <br/>AND<br/>, the pollsters will tell everyone it is safe to end the estrangement. <br/>The truly interesting question is what might come after that. No one knows, <br/>AND<br/>exactly what we should: Go down and lift those people up.’’10 <br/>We should not make too much of this off-the-cuff response, <br/>AND<br/>word and I’ll turn that f—— island into a parking lot.’’11 <br/>What would seem puzzling to a visitor from another planet is why, when the <br/>AND<br/>major issue for Kennedy, who had much else on his mind.’’12<br/>And this combination of awesome power and globe-girding responsibili- ties helps explain <br/>AND<br/>that would cost in the currency that might matter most: world opinion. <br/>So what was plan B? First, there were a few years of what <br/>AND<br/>we ought to do to pinch their nuts more than we’re doing.’’14 <br/>Nut pinching—an embargo—has been U.S. policy ever since<br/>AND</p><dl><dt>’’we might just as well get used to the idea.’’16<br/>But tugging U.S. policy toward greater involvement is domestic politics— Cuban <br/>AND<br/>’’ Like its predecessor, the Obama administration is committed to uplifting Cuba. <br/>Like the two post–Cold War presidents sandwiched between them—Bill Clinton and <br/>AND<br/>- tion, the greater energy, the purer morality of America.’’19 <br/>Today’s uplifting effort, which focuses on promoting democracy, carries on a tradition established <br/>AND<br/>a day or of a year, but of a longer period.’’20 <br/>Wood’s letter arrived in Washington at a moment when McKinley’s thoughts were on domestic politics—reelection—and when the rival Demo- crats were already making political capital out of his administration’s inability to pacify the Philippines, another part of the spoils seized from Spain. Seeking to balance that quagmire with progress in Cuba, the president ordered Wood to draw up the ?rst U.S. plan for Cuba’s democracy. <br/>Wood did so. It began with the disenfranchisement of that part of the Cuban <br/>AND<br/>San Domingo, will be regarded as an event of ?rst importance.’’21 <br/>But then, when given their opportunity to vote—for Cuba’s ?rst constitu- <br/>AND<br/>change of government, unless it be annexation to the United States.’’22 <br/>But the Republicans had made an unambiguous campaign commitment to Cuban independence, and so <br/>AND<br/>. Estrada Palma’s election ended Washington’s ?rst effort to promote democracy in Cuba.<br/>A second effort began four years later, in 1906, when a substantial number <br/>AND<br/>am seeking the very minimum of interference necessary to make them good.’’ <br/>Forced to the defensive after retaking a country only recently granted its independence, Roosevelt’s <br/>AND<br/>you need here among the Cubans is a desire to make money.’’25 <br/>As did Leonard Wood before him, Taft understood that the uplifting would not be <br/>AND<br/>by administering their Gov- ernment for two years or twenty years.’’27 <br/>As an alternative to a time-consuming attempt to de-Hispanicize Cuban culture<br/>AND<br/>elec- tion, and in early 1909, he sailed for home. <br/>Although U.S. forces returned in 1912 to quash a complex Afro-<br/>AND<br/>sugar estates in central Cuba, where they stayed for ?ve years.28 <br/>It was during this partial occupation that the Wilson administration pres- sured President Mario <br/>AND<br/>recommendations which the President has instructed General Crowder to convey to him.’’29 <br/>Two days later, Crowder sailed into Havana’s harbor aboard a battleship, the USS <br/>AND<br/>.

H)</em></p><p>For years American political leaders and media were fond of labeling Cuba an "international pariah". We haven’t heard that for a very long time. Perhaps one reason is the annual vote in the United Nations General Assembly on the resolution which reads: "Necessity of ending the economic, commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba". This is how the vote has gone (not including abstentions):<br/>Year Votes (Yes-No) No Votes <br/>1992 59-2 US, Israel 1993 88-4 US, Israel, Albania, Paraguay <br/>1994 101-2 US, Israel 1995 117-3 US, Israel, Uzbekistan <br/>1996 138-3 US, Israel, Uzbekistan <br/>1997 143-3 US, Israel, Uzbekistan <br/>1998 157-2 US, Israel <br/>1999 155-2 US, Israel <br/>2000 167-3 US, Israel, Marshall Islands <br/>2001 167-3 US, Israel, Marshall Islands 2002 173-3 US, Israel, Marshall Islands <br/>2003 179-3 US, Israel, Marshall Islands <br/>2004 179-4 US, Israel, Marshall Islands, Palau <br/>2005 182-4 US, Israel, Marshall Islands, Palau <br/>2006 183-4 US, Israel, Marshall Islands, Palau <br/>2007 184-4 US, Israel, Marshall Islands, Palau <br/>2008 185-3 US, Israel, Palau <br/>2009 187-3 US, Israel, Palau <br/>2010 187-2 US, Israel <br/>2011 186-2 US, Israel <br/>2012 188-3 US, Israel, Palau <br/>2013 188-2 US, Israel <br/>Each fall the UN vote is a welcome reminder that the world has not completely lost its senses and that the American empire does not completely control the opinion of other governments.<br/>Speaking before the General Assembly, October 29, Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez declared: "The economic damages accumulated after half a century as a result of the implementation of the blockade amount to 241.126 trillion." He added that the blockade "has been further tightened under President Obama’s administration", some 30 US and foreign entities being hit with 242.446 billion in fines due to their interaction with Cuba.<br/>However, the American envoy, Ronald Godard, in an appeal to other countries to oppose the resolution, said:<br/>"The international community … cannot in good conscience ignore the ease and frequency with which the Cuban regime silences critics, disrupts peaceful assembly, impedes independent journalism and, despite positive reforms, continues to prevent some Cubans from leaving or returning to the island. The Cuban government continues its tactics of politically motivated detentions, harassment and police violence against Cuban citizens."~1~<br/>So there you have it. That is why Cuba must be punished. One can only guess what Mr. Godard would respond if told that more than 7,000 people were arrested in the United States during the Occupy Movement’s first 8 months of protest;~2~ that their encampments were violently smashed up; that many of them were physically abused by the police.<br/>Does Mr. Godard ever read a newspaper or the Internet, or watch television? Hardly a day passes in America without a police officer shooting to death an unarmed person?<br/>As to "independent journalism" – what would happen if Cuba announced that from now on anyone in the country could own any kind of media? How long would it be before CIA money – secret and unlimited CIA money financing all kinds of fronts in Cuba – would own or control most of the media worth owning or controlling?<br/>The real reason for Washington’s eternal hostility toward Cuba? The fear of a good example of an alternative to the capitalist model; a fear that has been validated repeatedly over the years as Third World countries have expressed their adulation of Cuba.<br/>How the embargo began: On April 6, 1960, Lester D.

It manifests itself here in the state as a relation to other states, each of which is autonomous vis-a-vis the others...this negative relation of the state to itself is embodied in the world as the relation of one state to another and as if the negative were something external.30 <br/>Schmitt is important both for understanding the way in which such alienation is seen as <br/>AND<br/>it society is not political and a people cannot be said to exist:<br/>Only the actual participants can correctly recognise, understand and judge the concrete situation and settle the extreme case of conflict...to judge whether the adversary intends to negate his opponent’s way of life and therefore must be repulsed or fought in order to preserve one’s own form of existence.33<br/>Schmitt links this stark ontology to war when he states that the political is only <br/>AND<br/>enemy distinction’.34 War, in short, is an existential condition:<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the entire life of a human being is a struggle and every human being is symbolically a combatant. The friend, enemy and combat concepts receive their real meaning precisely because they refer to the real possibility of physical killing. War follows from enmity. War is the existential negation of the enemy.35<br/>Schmitt claims that his theory is not biased towards war as a choice (’It is by no means as though the political signifies nothing but devastating war and every political deed a military action...it neither favours war nor militarism, neither imperialism nor pacifism’) but it is hard to accept his caveat at face value.36<br/>When such a theory takes the form of a social discourse (which it does <br/>AND<br/>ontologies of war join into a closed circle of mutual support and justification.<br/>This closed circle of existential and strategic reason generates a number of dangers. Firstly<br/>AND<br/>Israeli-Arab conflict, are arguably examples of such ontologies in action.<br/>Secondly, the militaristic force of such an ontology is visible, in Schmitt, in the absolute sense of vulnerability whereby a people can judge whether their ’adversary intends to negate his opponent’s way of life’.38 Evoking the kind of thinking that would become controversial in the Bush doctrine, Hegel similarly argues that:<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...a state may regard its infinity and honour as at stake in each <br/>AND<br/>addition as a cause of strife the idea of such an injury...39<br/>Identity, even more than physical security or autonomy, is put at stake in <br/>AND<br/>by conservatives to justify military adventurism and a rejectionist policy towards the Palestinians.<br/>On the reverse side of such ontologies of national insecurity we find pride and hubris, the belief that martial preparedness and action are vital or healthy for the existence of a people. Clausewitz’s thought is thoroughly imbued with this conviction. For example, his definition of war as an act of policy does not refer merely to the policy of cabinets, but expresses the objectives and will of peoples:<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When whole communities go to war — whole peoples, and especially civilized peoples — the reason always lies in some political situation and the occasion is always due to some political object. War, therefore, is an act of policy.42<br/>Such a perspective prefigures Schmitt’s definition of the ’political’ (an earlier translation reads ’war<br/>AND<br/>merges the existential and rationalistic conceptions of war into a theoretical unity.44<br/>The idea that national identities could be built and redeemed through war derived from the <br/>AND<br/>time to time to shake them to the very centre by war’.46<br/>The historian Azar Gat points to the similarity of Clausewitz’s arguments that ’a people and <br/>AND<br/>than cool political reason...war is a major aspect of being.’48<br/>Hegel’s text argues that war is ’a work of freedom’ in which ’the individual’s substantive duty’ merges with the ’independence and sovereignty of the state’.49 Through war, he argues,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the ethical health of peoples is preserved in their indifference to the stabilization of finite institutions; just as the blowing of the winds preserves the sea from the foulness which would be the result of a prolonged calm, so the corruption in nations would be the product of a prolonged, let alone ’perpetual’ peace.50 <br/>Hegel indeed argues that ’sacrifice on behalf of the individuality of the state is a <br/>AND<br/>realisation in which the individual dissolves into the higher unity of the state:<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intrinsic worth of courage as a disposition of mind is to be found <br/>AND<br/>an attitude of complete indifference or even liking towards them as individuals.52<br/>A more frank statement of the potentially lethal consequences of patriotism — and its simultaneously <br/>AND<br/>war and the social contract in the form of the national security state.<br/>Strategic Reason and Scientific Truth<br/>By itself, such an account of the nationalist ontology of war and security provides <br/>AND<br/>a machinic process of which war and violence are viewed as normal features.<br/>These are the deeper claims and implications of Clausewitzian strategic reason. One of the <br/>AND<br/>, removed technical limits from the exercise of power in foreign policy’.55<br/>Kissinger’s conviction was based not merely in his pride in the vast military and bureaucratic <br/>AND<br/>view that the real world is almost entirely internal to the observer’.56<br/>At the same time, Kissinger’s hubris and hunger for control was beset by a <br/>AND<br/>hunger for stasis and certainty that would entrench U.S. hegemony:<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the two decades after 1945, our international activities were based on the <br/>AND<br/>multipolarity even though overwhelming military strength will remain with the two superpowers.58 <br/>Kissinger’s statement revealed that such cravings for order and certainty continually confront chaos, resistance <br/>AND<br/>with a deeply controversial and divisive war to remove Saddam Hussein from power.<br/>In this struggle with the lessons of Vietnam, revolutionary resistance, and rapid geopolitical <br/>AND<br/>associated rationality...does not inevitably produce a similar concept of reality’.61<br/>We sense the rational policymaker’s frustrated desire: the world is supposed to work like a machine, ordered by a form of power and governmental reason which deploys machines and whose desires and processes are meant to run along ordered, rational lines like a machine. Kissinger’s desire was little different from that of Cromer who, wrote Edward Said:<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...envisions a seat of power in the West and radiating out from it towards the East a great embracing machine, sustaining the central authority yet commanded by it. What the machine’s branches feed into it from the East — human material, material wealth, knowledge, what have you — is processed by the machine, then converted into more power...the immediate translation of mere Oriental matter into useful substance.62<br/>This desire for order in the shadow of chaos and uncertainty — the constant war <br/>AND<br/>an exclusively quantitative analysis could science attain certain knowledge of the world’.65<br/>Such doctrines of mathematically verifiable truth were to have powerful echoes in the 20th Century<br/>AND<br/>control of the weapons themselves, into political utility and rational strategy.66<br/>Bacon thought of the new scientific method not merely as way of achieving a purer <br/>AND<br/>, that man may be said to be a god unto man’.68<br/>We may be forgiven for blinking, but in Bacon’s thought ’man’ was indeed in the process of stealing a new fire from the heavens and seizing God’s power over the world for itself. Not only would the new empirical science lead to ’an improvement of mankind’s estate, and an increase in their power over nature’, but would reverse the primordial humiliation of the Fall of Adam:<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For man, by the fall, lost at once his state of innocence<br/>AND<br/>ceremonies) at length to afford mankind in some degree his bread...69<br/>There is a breathtaking, world-creating hubris in this statement — one that<br/>AND<br/>inventions are a blessing and a benefit without injuring or afflicting any’.70<br/>And what would be mankind’s ’bread’, the rewards of its new ’empire over creation’<br/>AND<br/>much as enlightenment; the destruction of nature as much as its utilisation.<br/>Doubts and Fears: Technology as Ontology<br/>If Bacon could not reasonably be expected to foresee many of these developments, the idea that scientific and technological progress could be destructive did occur to him. However it was an anxiety he summarily dismissed:<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...let none be alarmed at the objection of the arts and sciences becoming depraved to malevolent or luxurious purposes and the like, for the same can be said of every worldly good; talent, courage, strength, beauty, riches, light itself...Only let mankind regain their rights over nature, assigned to them by the gift of God, and obtain that power, whose exercise will be governed by right reason and true religion.71<br/>By the mid-Twentieth Century, after the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, such fears could no longer be so easily wished away, as the physicist and scientific director of the Manhattan Project, J. Robert Oppenheimer recognised. He said in a 1947 lecture:<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We felt a particularly intimate responsibility for suggesting, for supporting and in the end in large measure achieving the realization of atomic weapons...In some sort of crude sense which no vulgarity, no humor, no over-statement can quite extinguish, the physicists have known sin, and this is a knowledge they cannot lose.72<br/>Adam had fallen once more, but into a world which refused to acknowledge its <br/>AND<br/>and Descartes’ faith in mathematics to make of the Bomb a rational weapon.<br/>Oppenheimer — who resolutely opposed the development of the hydrogen bomb — understood what the <br/>AND<br/>an unmooring quality; it finds men unprepared to deal with it.’75<br/>Martin Heidegger questioned this mapping of natural science onto the social world in his essays <br/>AND<br/>of science for politics, knowledge for force, or force for good.<br/>Instead, Oppenheimer saw a process frustrated by roadblocks and ruptured by irony; in <br/>AND<br/>political certainty; it turns control over ’facts’ into control over the earth.<br/>Heidegger’s insights into this phenomena I find especially telling and disturbing — because they underline <br/>AND<br/>technology. The actual threat has already affected man in his essence.’77<br/>This process Heidegger calls ’Enframing’ and through it the scientific mind demands that ’nature reports <br/>AND<br/>human lives are reduced to tools, obstacles, useful or obstinate matter.<br/>This tells us much about the enduring power of crude instrumental versions of strategic thought<br/>AND<br/>of the sand and take action toward shutting down Hezbollah-land.’81<br/>Conclusion: Violent Ontologies or Peaceful Choices?<br/>I was motivated to begin the larger project from which this essay derives by a <br/>AND<br/>fail to question the ontological claims of political community or strategic theory.82<br/>In the case of a theorist like Jean Bethke Elshtain, just war doctrine is <br/>AND<br/>destructive and violent way of acknowledging and dealing with conflict and difference.85<br/>My argument here, whilst normatively sympathetic to Kant’s moral demand for the eventual abolition <br/>AND<br/>revealing and hence to experience the call of a more primal truth.’87<br/>What I take from Heidegger’s argument — one that I have sought to extend by <br/>AND<br/>and violence as necessary policy responses, however ineffective, dysfunctional or chaotic.<br/>The force of my own and Heidegger’s analysis does, admittedly, tend towards a <br/>AND<br/>are certainly tremendously aggressive and energetic in continually stating and reinstating its force.<br/>But is there a way out? Is there no possibility of agency and choice<br/>AND<br/>us valuable clues to the kind of sensibility needed, but little more.<br/>When we consider the problem of policy, the force of this analysis suggests that <br/>AND<br/>and activating a very different concept of existence, security and action.90<br/>This would seem to hinge upon ’questioning’ as such — on the questions we put <br/>AND<br/>to end the global rule of insecurity and violence?

This book explores and accounts for their distinctiveness.<br/>The evidence presented in the next chapters has direct implications for three topics of much <br/>AND<br/>. The focus on RTAs brings new evidence to bear on these issues.<br/>The specific focus of the book is on two major areas of difference among RTAs<br/>AND<br/>labels should list all ingredients, or racial discrimination in hiring is acceptable.<br/>Regional market building poses special challenges. Historically, most markets have formed slowly over <br/>AND<br/>it requires fundamental changes in subtle and sometimes implicit notions about the world.<br/>RTA officials have responded differently to this challenge. In some areas, they have <br/>AND<br/>, if problems arise, to turn to reactive conflict-resolution mechanisms.<br/>RTAs differ not only in the complexity of their legal architectures but also in the <br/>AND<br/>labor, medical conditions, and the use of food additives quite differently.<br/>The second claim concerns the responses of societal organizations to regional integration. Different interest <br/>AND<br/>, the expansion of furniture manufacturers, and the internationalization of transportation departments.<br/>In some cases, analogous organizations develop regional structures and programs across different RTAs. But those cases still see important differences across those organizations in terms of specific structures and programs. If, for instance, farmers emerge at the regional level in two RTAs, their members’ profiles and their objectives are likely to vary. Similarly, if textile companies expand internationally in two given RTAs, what exactly they produce will differ.<br/>What helps explain these differences in law and organizational developments? The Social Construction of <br/>AND<br/>the grounds in the member states and that RTAs acquire their distinctive character.<br/>Specifically, in the case of interventionism versus minimalism in regional law, the presence <br/>AND<br/>, and so on) that have flourished in those dominant regulatory environments.<br/>As to the targets and content of regional law, we consider again existing legal <br/>AND<br/>boundaries of the permissible, the final character of any given regional law.<br/>Organizational changes in RTAs also reflect existing institutional and political contexts. Those organizations that <br/>AND<br/>area, organizations adapt by expanding their operations in tandem with such law.<br/>The evidence for these claims concerns three RTAs in Europe and the Americas: the <br/>AND<br/>important notions surrounding labor rights, yet their definitions and visions vary significantly.<br/>We will then consider the evolution of three types of organizations in the same three <br/>AND<br/>, crucially, that those units and processes are particular to each RTA.<br/>The argument and evidence presented in this book directly challenge the recent writing of a <br/>AND<br/>the local as a place of difference. Three strands are especially important.<br/>Some proponents of globalization suggest that the world is becoming an increasingly homogenous place. <br/>AND<br/>, offer similar examples (Arrighi 2000; Burtless et al. 2000).<br/>A second set of globalization theorists point to increased international cooperation. As human communities <br/>AND<br/>nation state are being eroded in favor of a global, cosmopolitan system.<br/>A third group of proponents acknowledges that the world remains full of variation and idiosyncrasies<br/>AND<br/>people are well aware of events and systems outside of their small country.<br/>This book challenges these visions of a global world, and especially those related to <br/>AND<br/>either be untenable or still only be achieved quite far into the future.<br/>This book naturally aligns itself with the critics of the globalization thesis.

Economic collapse, incompetent leadership and Cuban meddling may provoke a showdown among well-armed chavista rivals, with civilians caught in the crossfire. US diplomats, who’ve spent years ignoring or minimizing threats emanating from Venezuela, must act urgently to prevent a Syria scenario on our doorstep.<br/>The late dictator Hugo Chávez left behind a mess: His divisive, illegitimate regime polarized society and devastated the economy. Inflation is running at 50 percent, while the vital oil sector is faltering. The bloated, bankrupt state can’t sustain the social spending that kept the peace; the nation already faces food shortages, power outages and rampant crime.<br/>Chávez’s hapless successor, Nicolás Maduro, won disputed elections in April in what even he called a "Pyrrhic victory." His mismanagement since has only hastened the country’s decline — for example, dealing with toilet-paper shortages by confiscating paper companies.<br/>Maduro has resorted to accusing the Obama White House of plotting the collapse of the Venezuelan economy. He’s also created a "vice ministry of supreme social happiness" in an Orwellian gesture to tamp down widespread social anxiety. He even moved up Christmas celebrations up in advance of the Dec. 8 local elections.<br/>Last week, Maduro publicly ordered retailers to lower prices on consumer goods. Security forces arrested dozens of shopkeepers and stood by as mobs emptied store shelves. Good luck seeing those shelves restocked. As he further tightens economic controls, Venezuelans will have to settle for what the government provides. Their only other choices: Flee the country, turn to crime — or oppose the regime.<br/>Maduro is most worried about the last. He recently ordered the detention of several civic leaders who’d been mobilizing protest rallies. Regime sources say that he may even nix the upcoming elections and jail well-known opposition politicians.<br/>Most blame these draconian measures on Maduro’s Cuban handlers, the puppeteers behind his rise to power. The destitute Castro regime’s survival depends on Venezuelan oil, so it means to keep Maduro in power by repressing popular unrest and ferreting out dissent — including within the regime.<br/>By pushing Maduro to purge powerful chavistas — many with ties to the military — who disapprove of Havana’s heavy hand, the Cubans have likely overreached. This crackdown has stoked tension within the military between those aligned with Maduro and nationalists who’ve never been comfortable in a Cuban harness.<br/>The regime has very little room to maneuver. Virtually every Venezuelan is infuriated by the daily fight for survival. The anti-chavistas are fed up with the harassment by an illegitimate and incompetent one-party state. All sides in the military are busy weighing their options.<br/>Any act of repression, street brawl, electoral fraud or corruption scandal could unleash all the fury built up over the regime’s 15 years. Tragically, the sight of military units squaring off in the streets of Caracas is not a distant memory.<br/>The United States imports about half the Venezuelan petroleum that it did when Chávez was elected in 1998, but that’s still 9 percent of our foreign oil purchases. Plus, an implosion of Venezuela’s economy — or, God forbid, prolonged civil warfare — will roil the international oil markets and destabilize the region when the US economy is sputtering.<br/>What’s worse, in the last decade, Venezuela has become a narco-state, with dozens of senior officials and state-run enterprises complicit in the lucrative cocaine trade. The regime also is an ally of Iran and Hezbollah, which may find their own ways to exploit chaos in Venezuela.<br/>Geography makes the bloodbath in Syria all but invisible to Americans, but Venezuela is a three-hour flight from Miami and No. 3 in the world in social networking. The US public will see photos and videos of innocent demonstrators mowed down in the street.

The pair have been vital strategic partners, despite the undeniable political differences between both their governments.<br/>These differences can be seen clearly in their foreign policies. In contrast with the ones implemented by Hugo Chávez and Nicolás Maduro, marked by their ideological bias, those favored by Lula and Rousseff have been more pragmatic; they are mainly based on economic interests and their traditional geo-strategic objective, to consolidate themselves as a regional and global power.<br/>This explains Brazil’s friendly but conditional stance towards Venezuela during the Chavista regime. In <br/>AND<br/>due to the economic crisis and the political instability of Nicolás Maduro’s administration.<br/>We should recall that it was in 2005, with Lula, when the "strategic alliance" was truly signed between Brasília and Caracas. Officials initiated agreements on a wide array of matters, quarterly meetings, and a cooperation facility. As these links strengthened, a very privileged partnership arose, which brought about an 858 percent increase in Brazilian exports to Venezuela. According to the Venezuelan Ministry of Foreign Affairs, total Brazil-Venezuela trade grew seven-fold from 2003 to 2012.<br/>Regarding politics and diplomacy, though, President Lula signaled his distance from Chávez’s stance in matters that compromised Brazilian interests. For instance, during confrontations between the Commandante and George W. Bush’s administration in the United States and with the Colombian Álvaro Uribe, Lula acted as mediator or an appeaser with Chávez.<br/>Still, Lula’s support for Chávez afforded the Venezuelan president international legitimacy. He did so through action or omission, sometimes with complicit silence, sometimes in a direct way or through his minister of foreign affairs, Celso Amorin, or his adviser Marco Aurelio García, who were in charge of his foreign policy.<br/>With Lula’s successor, Dilma Rousseff, those fruitful bilateral relations have continued. Venezuela still accounts for 15 percent of Brazil’s total trade surplus. In 2012, their bilateral trade reached a record US246.1 billion — although it favored Brazil steeply, where 80 percent of the traded goods and services came from. The energy sector accounted for Venezuela’s 20 percent (state-led).<br/>Russeff and Maduro too have a cordial relationship. One of the Venezuelan president’s first visits this year, after his dubious electoral win, was to Brazil — and Brazil was one of the first countries to offer diplomatic acknowledgement. During the meeting, both leaders committed to sustaining their alliance and signed new agreements. Later, Brazilian authorities ensured that they would help Venezuela overcome the serious shortages it is currently experiencing.<br/>Nevertheless, neither commercial nor diplomatic relations have been quite the same as those between <br/>AND<br/>although these are not as acute as those faced by her Venezuelan counterpart.<br/>The disastrous economic situation in Venezuela is also a factor in Russeff’s growing apart. <br/>AND<br/>payments of exports from Brazilian companies this year are already four months late.<br/>Brazil’s subtle distancing is also due to the militarization and radicalization of Maduro’s administration. <br/>AND<br/>that she prefers "the noise of newspapers to the silence of dictatorships."<br/>After all, Brazil is aware that it enjoys a democracy in which the media <br/>AND<br/>and has long ceased to be the epicenter of the Latin American left.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HVenezuelaninstability2019sonthebrink2014theconditionoftheplaniskey2014absentit2Cinstabilityspillsovertothebroaderregion." class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Venezuelan instability’s on the brink — the condition of the plan is key — absent it, instability spills over to the broader region.</span></h4><p>Trinkunas 1/23, Harold, Charles W.

Venezuela is experiencing declining export revenues, accelerating inflation and widespread shortages of basic consumer goods. At the same time, the Maduro administration has foreclosed peaceful options for Venezuelans to bring about a change in its current policies.<br/>President Maduro, who came to power in a highly-contested election last April, has reacted to the economic crisis with interventionist and increasingly authoritarian measures. His recent orders to slash prices of goods sold in private businesses resulted in episodes of looting, which suggests a latent potential for violence. He has put the armed forces on the street to enforce his economic decrees, exposing them to popular discontent.<br/>Although the volume of crude oil that Venezuela supplies to the United States has declined <br/>AND<br/>violence-induced regime change in Venezuela would create a volatile situation regionally.<br/>Our leverage is limited, given our poor relations with the Maduro administration. I <br/>AND<br/>have the institutional mechanisms by which to influence their government to change course.<br/>Background<br/>Production by the national oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), has been falling for over a decade due to underinvestment, poor maintenance and the loss of skilled workers. International investment in the oil sector has been deterred by erratic and arbitrary government policies. Further aggravating balance of payments problems, Venezuela sells a substantial amount of its oil at below market prices to China, Cuba, its allies in the Americas and its own citizens.<br/>Dwindling oil revenues are a problem because oil constitutes over 95 percent of Venezuela’s exports, and two-thirds of food and consumer goods are imported. Hugo Chávez nationalized and then mismanaged many domestic industries, undermining local production. Maduro has since doubled down on these policies. In addition, his administration is increasingly financing the public sector by ordering the central bank to print more money. These policies produced the highest inflation rate in the world in 2013.<br/>The government’s response to scarcity has been to decree price reductions and create government agencies to manage all imports. This produced a rush to acquire what consumer goods remain, compounding the already existing shortage of staples. The Maduro administration has promised that it will ensure sufficient imports, but it has a poor record with the large segments of the economy it already controls.<br/>Venezuela still holds elections regularly, but the Maduro administration has undermined democratic institutions. <br/>AND<br/>elections, the Maduro administration creates parallel governing institutions to route around them.<br/>The risk of a violent outcome may still be low, but it will rise <br/>AND<br/>level, and elections are not scheduled to take place again until 2015.<br/>Ultimately, the armed forces are key to Maduro’s hold on power, but he <br/>AND<br/>existence also means that any attempt to overthrow Maduro will quickly turn violent.<br/>Violence in Venezuela would have international consequences, mainly through its potential to interrupt oil <br/>AND<br/>exports and because of Venezuela’s role in Colombia’s peace negotiations with its insurgency.<br/>There are few good options that could be taken to reduce the likelihood of violence. To begin with, we must bear in mind that the United States lacks the diplomatic tools, such as democracy assistance, to influence outcomes in Venezuela. Overt U.S. criticism of the Maduro administration or efforts to exert our limited economic leverage would be grist for the mill of the Venezuelan propaganda machine; we should avoid that.<br/>The focus of our efforts thus should be to work with regional and international partners <br/>AND<br/>invoke the Inter-American Democratic Charter to address the situation in Venezuela. <br/>Brazil is both politically and economically influential in Venezuela, and it has enough at <br/>AND<br/>. However, it offers the best available option under the current circumstances.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h3 id="H1AC2014RelationsADV" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>1AC — Relations ADV</span></h3><p>ADVANTAGE TWO IS RELATIONS</p><h4 id="HIsrael-Palestinewarcausesextinction2014riskofwarishigh." class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Israel-Palestine war causes extinction — risk of war is high.</span></h4><p>Beres 11/11, Louis, 2013, "The Future of Israel’s Nuclear Deterrence: Debates about Iran and Palestinian statehood will have an effect on Israel’s mode of self-defense," <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2013/11/11/iran-israel-and-the-nuclear-threat-in-the-middle-east)//DR.  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2013/11/11/iran-israel-and-the-nuclear-threat-in-the-middle-east)//DR.%27" tppabs="http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2013/11/11/iran-israel-and-the-nuclear-threat-in-the-middle-east)//DR."><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2013/11/11/iran-israel-and-the-nuclear-threat-in-the-middle-east)//DR.</span></a></span> H</p><p>A Palestinian state would make Israel’s conventional capabilities more problematic; it could thereby heighten the chances of a regional nuclear war. Although Palestine itself would obviously be non-nuclear, its overall strategic impact could nonetheless be magnified by continuously unfolding and more-or-less unpredictable developments in Egypt, Syria, Libya, Lebanon and elsewhere in this roiling and chaotic area.<br/>A nuclear war could arrive in Israel not only as a "bolt-from<br/>AND<br/>reprisals might be met, in the future, with enemy nuclear counterstrikes.<br/>For now, this would become possible only if a still-nuclearizing Iran were <br/>AND<br/>the first place, could reduce Israel’s escalatory exposure to a nuclear war.<br/>Pertinent questions arise. With its implicit ("deliberately ambiguous") nuclear capacities, why should Israel need a conventional deterrent at all? After all, even after Palestinian statehood, wouldn’t all rational enemy states desist from launching any conventional or biological attacks upon Israel out of an entirely sensible fear of Israeli nuclear retaliation? <br/>Not necessarily. Aware that Israel would cross the nuclear threshold only in very extraordinary circumstances, these enemy states could be convinced – rightly or wrongly – that as long as their attacks remained recognizably non-nuclear, Israel would always respond in kind.<br/>The only credible way for Israel to deter large-scale conventional attacks after the <br/>AND<br/>were undertaken, lead quickly via escalation to various forms of unconventional war. <br/>However unforeseen, Palestine, already a "nonmember observer state" at the United Nations, would have measurably corrosive effects on power and peace in the Middle East. As, by definition, the creation of this particular Arab state would come at the territorial expense of Israel, the Jewish state’s strategic depth would promptly and irretrievably diminish. Over time, Israel’s conventional capacity to ward off enemy attacks could be commensurately reduced. <br/>If certain enemy states were to perceive Israel’s own sense of expanding weakness and possible <br/>AND<br/>prove calamitous for the "winner," as well as the "loser."<br/>To be sure, a meaningful risk of regional nuclear war in the Middle East exists independently of any Palestinian state. Still, this unprecedented risk would be further enlarged if a 23rd Arab state were to appear more-or-less simultaneously with Iranian nuclear weapons. Above anything else, Israel must now do what is needed to prevent such coinciding and mutually-reinforcing and existential perils.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HDiseasescauseextinction." class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Diseases cause extinction.</span></h4><p>Casadevall 12, Professor of Microbiology, Immunology, and the Division of Infectious Diseases at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Arturo, "The future of biological warfare," Microbial Biotechnology, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1751-7915.2012.00340.x/pdf)//DR.  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1751-7915.2012.00340.x/pdf)//DR.%27" tppabs="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1751-7915.2012.00340.x/pdf)//DR."><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1751-7915.2012.00340.x/pdf)//DR.</span></a></span> H</p><p>Existential threats to humanity<br/>In considering the importance of biological warfare as a subject for concern it is worthwhile <br/>AND<br/>their hosts and that some proportion of the host population was naturally resistant.<br/>However, that calculation does not apply to microbes that are acquired directly from the <br/>AND<br/>acquired the capacity for pathogenicity as a consequence of natural evolution or bioengineering.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HNuclearterrorismresultsinextinction." class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Nuclear terrorism results in extinction.</span></h4><p>Hellman, 08 ~Martin E.
