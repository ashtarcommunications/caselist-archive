The Mexican government briefly stopped its vetted officials from cooperating in sensitive investigations. The Americans are waiting to see if Mexico allows polygraphs when assigning new members to units, a senior Obama administration official said.<br/>In another clash, American security officials were recently asked to leave an important intelligence <br/>AND<br/>clear that they would put tighter reins on the sharing of drug intelligence.<br/>There have long been political sensitivities in Mexico over allowing too much American involvement.

"You close the door on diplomacy, and you’re left only with a choice between a possible military option or Iran steadily advancing its nuclear program."<br/>National Journal reported today that Senator Bob Menendez, the chairman of the Foreign Relations <br/>AND<br/>sit back and wait to see whether a comprehensive agreement can be reached."<br/>The bill Dems may introduce would impose sanctions after the six month deadline in the <br/>AND<br/>by dangling the threat of sanctions later, to increase pressure on Iran.<br/>But the administration has told these Democrats — publicly and privately — that their bill <br/>AND<br/>argue that the U.S. is not negotiating in good faith.<br/>"It is not necessary for Congress to pass this bill, because we are enforcing existing sanctions and can move to sanctions if negotiations don’t succeed or if Iran cheats," the senior administration official says.

While Senators like <br/>AND<br/>and could "bolster the efforts of Iran’s militants to kill the deal."<br/>With some Senate Dems coming out against Congressional action — and with the administration lobbying hard behind the scenes – it’s possible that a sanctions bill could actually go down to defeat in the Senate, which would be a rebuke to the hawks. But it’s very possible one could pass, and if the White House is right, it would put the prospects of a long term diplomatic breakthrough in doubt.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HBipartisaneffortsinhouseandsenatesupportGuantanomo" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Bipartisan efforts in house and senate support Guantanomo</span></h4><p><strong>AP 7/5</strong><br/>~Cassata, Donna, "Obama’s toughest sell on Guantanamo: Senate Dems," Lexis, accessed 7-6-13 <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="Uhttp://www.news-star.com/article/20130705/NEWS/130709838R~~"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">Uhttp://www.news-star.com/article/20130705/NEWS/130709838R~~</span></a></span></p><p>President Barack Obama’s hardest sell in his renewed push to close the U.S. detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, may be members of his own party moderate Senate Democrats facing tough re-election bids next year in the strongly Republican South.<br/>Obama has stepped up the pressure to shutter the naval facility, driven in part by his revised counterterrorism strategy and the 4-month-old stain of the government force-feeding Guantanamo prisoners on hunger strikes to prevent them from starving to death. Civil liberties groups and liberals have slammed Obama for failing to fulfill his 2008 campaign promise to close the installation and find another home for the 166 terror suspects being held there indefinitely.<br/>Republicans and some Democrats in Congress have repeatedly resisted the president’s attempts to close the facility, arguing that the prisoners are too dangerous to be moved to U.S. soil, that Guantanamo is a perfectly adequate prison and that the administration has failed to offer a viable alternative.<br/>White House counterterrorism adviser Lisa Monaco lobbied House members in advance of several votes last month to no avail. The House delivered strong votes to keep Guantanamo open and to prevent Obama from transferring detainees to Yemen. Separately, the president’s recent appointment of a special envoy on Guantanamo, Cliff Sloan, has met with a collective shrug on Capitol Hill.<br/>In the coming weeks, the Senate will again vote on the future of Guantanamo. All signs point to a bipartisan statement to keep the facility open despite a recent vow to end detention at the installation by two national security leaders Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and John McCain, R-Ariz.<br/>"When you go out, you talk to average Americans about it, they want to keep them there, they want to keep the terrorists there, they don’t necessarily want to hold them here," said Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., a fierce proponent of keeping Guantanamo open.<br/>Ayotte, who plans to push legislation on a sweeping defense policy bill later this summer, is likely to attract support from Republicans as well as several Democrats looking ahead to tight Senate races next year in Arkansas, Louisiana and North Carolina. Votes on the detention center will give these Democrats a high-profile chance to split with a president who is extremely unpopular in parts of the South.<br/>Consider Sen. Mark Pryor of Arkansas, one of the most vulnerable incumbents in next year’s congressional elections.<br/>Last November, he was one of nine Democrats to vote for prohibiting the use of any money to transfer terror suspects from Guantanamo, backing an amendment by Ayotte. The Senate easily passed the measure, 54-41, as part of the defense policy bill.<br/>Last month, a potential Republican challenger to Pryor, Arkansas Rep. Tom Cotton, was one of a handful of speakers during House debate on Guantanamo. Obama is pushing to transfer approved detainees there are 86 to their home countries and lift a ban on transfers to Yemen. Fifty-six of the 86 are from Yemen.<br/>Cotton, an Iraq and Afghanistan war veteran, pleaded with his colleagues to "ensure that terrorists at Guantanamo Bay do not escape back onto the battlefronts of the war on terror."<br/>Asked recently whether he favors keeping Guantanamo opened or closed, Pryor said simply, "Open."<br/>Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu, another Democrat who voted last year to keep the facility open, indicated she’s unlikely to change her position.<br/>"Honestly, I have mixed feelings about it," she said in a recent interview. "First of all, it’s hard to imagine that people should be detained indefinitely without formal charges being brought. On the other hand, you know, some of the people there are potential serious threats to national security."<br/>Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan of North Carolina, who faces re-election next year, also voted with Pryor and Landrieu to keep Guantanamo open. Her office had no comment on how she might vote later this summer.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HDiminishedcapitalmeansObamawilllosetheIranvote" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Diminished capital means Obama will lose the Iran vote</span></h4><p>Krasuhaar, 11/21/13 (Josh, National Journal, "The Iran Deal Puts Pro-Israel Democrats in a Bind" <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.nationaljournal.com/magazine/the-iran-deal-puts-pro-israel-democrats-in-a-bind-20131121)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.nationaljournal.com/magazine/the-iran-deal-puts-pro-israel-democrats-in-a-bind-20131121)%27" tppabs="http://www.nationaljournal.com/magazine/the-iran-deal-puts-pro-israel-democrats-in-a-bind-20131121)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.nationaljournal.com/magazine/the-iran-deal-puts-pro-israel-democrats-in-a-bind-20131121)</span></a></span></p><p>All of this puts Democrats, who routinely win overwhelming support from Jewish Americans on <br/>AND<br/>Foreign Relations committees to dissuade them from their efforts while diplomacy is underway.<br/>"There’s a fundamental disagreement between the vast majority of Congress and the president when it comes to increasing Iran sanctions right now," said one Democratic operative involved in the advocacy efforts.

But in this instance, it’s hard."<br/>That awkwardness has been evident in the lukewarm reaction from many of Obama’s Senate Democratic <br/>AND<br/>court press from Secretary of State John Kerry, a former congressional colleague.<br/>On Tuesday, after meeting with Obama, Menendez and Schumer signed a bipartisan letter to Kerry warning the administration about accepting a deal that would allow Iran to continue its nuclear program.

"But that doesn’t make them the dominant folks in the policy space of the party, or the Hill."<br/>Pro-Israel activists worry that one of the ironies of Obama’s situation is that <br/>AND<br/>off on any sanctions legislation until there’s a resolution to the Iranian negotiations. <br/>But if Obama’s standing continues to drop, and negotiations produce a deal that Israel doesn’t like, don’t be surprised to see Democrats become less hesitant about going their own way.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HThatcollapsesnegotiations" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>That collapses negotiations</span></h4><p>Gharib, 12/18/13 (Ali, The Cable – a Foreign Policy blog, "Exclusive: Top Senate Democrats Break with White House and Circulate New Iran Sanctions Bill" <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://thecable.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2013/12/18/exclusive_top_senate_democrats_break_with_white_house_and_circulate_new_iran_sancti)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://thecable.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2013/12/18/exclusive_top_senate_democrats_break_with_white_house_and_circulate_new_iran_sancti)%27" tppabs="http://thecable.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2013/12/18/exclusive_top_senate_democrats_break_with_white_house_and_circulate_new_iran_sancti)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://thecable.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2013/12/18/exclusive_top_senate_democrats_break_with_white_house_and_circulate_new_iran_sancti)</span></a></span></p><p>Critics of imposing new sanctions fear that the bill will violate either the spirit or <br/>AND<br/>Iran’s Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said, "The entire deal is dead."<br/>"The law as written comes close to violating the letter ~of the Geneva <br/>AND<br/>ammunition to hard-liners and other spoilers looking to derail further progress."<br/>Though a fact-sheet circulating with the new bill says it "does not violate the Joint Plan of Action," critics allege it would mark a defeat for the administration and the broader push for a diplomatic solution to the Iran crisis.<br/>"It would kill the talks, invalidate the interim deal to freeze Iran’s nuclear <br/>AND<br/>, and ensure that this standoff ends with war instead of a deal."<br/>The bill would in effect set up a direct confrontation with the White House, <br/>AND<br/>a deal that eliminated Iran’s entire nuclear program or its domestic enrichment capabilities.<br/>"If we could create an option in which Iran eliminated every single nut and <br/>AND<br/>are a lot of things that I can envision that would be wonderful."<br/>Alireza Nader, an Iran analyst at the RAND Corporation, agreed dismantling Iran’s entire nuclear program would be "pretty unrealistic." He added such an aim would be moving "backward": "The Geneva agreement basically states that if Iran is more transparent regarding its nuclear program and intentions, then it can be met with sanctions relief. That’s the goal: transparency."<br/>Nader said that diplomacy required flexibility from both sides, something the legislation doesn’t seem to contain.

How far <br/>AND<br/>known unknowns that have often wreaked havoc in this part of the world.<br/>Israel points to an imminent threat. European agencies are more relaxed, suggesting Tehran is still two years or so away from a weapon. Western diplomats broadly agree that Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has not taken a definitive decision to step over the line. What Iran has been seeking is what diplomats call a breakout capability – the capacity to dash to a bomb before the international community could effectively mobilise against it.<br/>The third fact – and this one is hard for many to swallow – is that neither a negotiated settlement nor the air strikes long favoured by Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, can offer the rest of the world a watertight insurance policy.<br/>It should be possible to construct a deal that acts as a plausible restraint – and extends the timeframe for any breakout – but no amount of restrictions or intrusive monitoring can offer a certain guarantee against Tehran’s future intentions.<br/>By the same token, bombing Iran’s nuclear sites could certainly delay the programme, perhaps for a couple of years. But, assuming that even the hawkish Mr Netanyahu is not proposing permanent war against Iran, air strikes would not end it.<br/>You cannot bomb knowledge and technical expertise. To try would be to empower those in Tehran who say the regime will be safe only when, like North Korea, it has a weapon. So when Barack Obama says the US will never allow Iran to get the bomb he is indulging in, albeit understandable, wishful thinking.<br/>The best the international community can hope for is that, in return for a relaxation of sanctions, Iran will make a judgment that it is better off sticking with a threshold capability. To put this another way, if Tehran does step back from the nuclear brink it will be because of its own calculation of the balance of advantage.<br/>The fourth element in this dynamic is that Iran now has a leadership that, faced with the severe and growing pain inflicted by sanctions, is prepared to talk. There is nothing to say that Hassan Rouhani, the president, is any less hard-headed than previous Iranian leaders, but he does seem ready to weigh the options.<br/>Seen from this vantage point – and in spite of the inconclusive outcome – Geneva <br/>AND<br/>secretary of state understands that serious diplomacy demands a willingness to take risks.<br/>The Geneva talks illuminated the shape of an interim agreement. Iran will not surrender <br/>AND<br/>with Tehran about the speed and scope of a run down of sanctions.</p><h4 id="HAnIsraelistrikefails2CbuttriggersWorldWar32Ccollapseshegandtheglobaleconomy" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>An Israeli strike fails, but triggers World War 3, collapses heg and the global economy</span></h4><p>Reuveny, 10 – professor in the School of Public and Environmental Affairs at Indiana University (Rafael, "Unilateral strike could trigger World War III, global depression" Gazette Xtra, &nbsp;8/7, - See more at: <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://gazettextra.com/news/2010/aug/07/con-unilateral-strike-could-trigger-world-war-iii-/~~23sthash.ec4zqu8o.dpuf)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://gazettextra.com/news/2010/aug/07/con-unilateral-strike-could-trigger-world-war-iii-/~~23sthash.ec4zqu8o.dpuf)%27" tppabs="http://gazettextra.com/news/2010/aug/07/con-unilateral-strike-could-trigger-world-war-iii-/~~23sthash.ec4zqu8o.dpuf)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://gazettextra.com/news/2010/aug/07/con-unilateral-strike-could-trigger-world-war-iii-/~~23sthash.ec4zqu8o.dpuf)</span></a></span></p><p>A unilateral Israeli strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities would likely have dire consequences, including a regional war, global economic collapse and a major power clash.<br/>For an Israeli campaign to succeed, it must be quick and decisive. This requires an attack that would be so overwhelming that Iran would not dare to respond in full force.<br/>Such an outcome is extremely unlikely since the locations of some of Iran’s nuclear facilities are not fully known and known facilities are buried deep underground.<br/>All of these widely spread facilities are shielded by elaborate air defense systems constructed not only by the Iranians but also the Chinese and, likely, the Russians as well.<br/>By now, Iran has also built redundant command and control systems and nuclear facilities, developed early warning systems, acquired ballistic and cruise missiles and upgraded and enlarged its armed forces.<br/>Because Iran is well-prepared, a single, conventional Israeli strike—or even numerous strikes—could not destroy all of its capabilities, giving Iran time to respond.<br/>Unlike Iraq, whose nuclear program Israel destroyed in 1981, Iran has a second-strike capability comprised of a coalition of Iranian, Syrian, Lebanese, Hezbollah, Hamas, and, perhaps, Turkish forces. Internal pressure might compel Jordan, Egypt and the Palestinian Authority to join the assault, turning a bad situation into a regional war.<br/>During the 1973 Arab-Israeli War, at the apex of its power, Israel was saved from defeat by President Nixon’s shipment of weapons and planes. Today, Israel’s numerical inferiority is greater, and it faces more determined and better-equipped opponents. After years of futilely fighting Palestinian irregular armies, Israel has lost some of its perceived superiority—bolstering its enemies’ resolve.<br/>Despite Israel’s touted defense systems, Iranian coalition missiles, armed forces, and terrorist attacks would likely wreak havoc on its enemy, leading to a prolonged tit-for-tat.<br/>In the absence of massive U.S. assistance, Israel’s military resources may quickly dwindle, forcing it to use its alleged nuclear weapons, as it had reportedly almost done in 1973.<br/>An Israeli nuclear attack would likely destroy most of Iran’s capabilities, but a crippled Iran and its coalition could still attack neighboring oil facilities, unleash global terrorism, plant mines in the Persian Gulf and impair maritime trade in the Mediterranean, Red Sea and Indian Ocean.<br/>Middle Eastern oil shipments would likely slow to a trickle as production declines due to the war and insurance companies decide to drop their risky Middle Eastern clients. Iran and Venezuela would likely stop selling oil to the United States and Europe.<br/>From there, things could deteriorate as they did in the 1930s. The world economy would head into a tailspin; international acrimony would rise; and Iraqi and Afghani citizens might fully turn on the United States, immediately requiring the deployment of more American troops.<br/>Russia, China, Venezuela, and maybe Brazil and Turkey—all of which essentially support Iran—could be tempted to form an alliance and openly challenge the U.S. hegemony.<br/>Russia and China might rearm their injured Iranian protege overnight, just as Nixon rearmed Israel, and threaten to intervene, just as the U.S.S.R. threatened to join Egypt and Syria in 1973. President Obama’s response would likely put U.S. forces on nuclear alert, replaying Nixon’s nightmarish scenario.<br/>Iran may well feel duty-bound to respond to a unilateral attack by its Israeli archenemy, but it knows that it could not take on the United States head-to-head. In contrast, if the United States leads the attack, Iran’s response would likely be muted.<br/>If Iran chooses to absorb an American-led strike, its allies would likely protest and send weapons but would probably not risk using force.<br/>While no one has a crystal ball, leaders should be risk-averse when choosing war as a foreign policy tool. If attacking Iran is deemed necessary, Israel must wait for an American green light. A unilateral Israeli strike could ultimately spark World War III.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>&nbsp;"Engagement" requires increasing economic contacts – plan isn’t engagement<br/>Resnick 1 – Dr. Evan Resnick, Ph.D. in Political Science from Columbia University, Assistant Professor of Political Science at Yeshiva University, "Defining Engagement", Journal of International Affairs, Spring, 54(2), Ebsco</p><p>A REFINED DEFINITION OF ENGAGEMENT<br/>In order to establish a more effective framework for dealing with unsavory regimes, I propose that we define engagement as the attempt to influence the political behavior of a target state through the comprehensive establishment and enhancement of contacts with that state across multiple issue-areas (i.e. diplomatic, military, economic, cultural). The following is a brief list of the specific forms that such contacts might include:<br/>DIPLOMATIC CONTACTS<br/>Extension of diplomatic recognition; normalization of diplomatic relations<br/>Promotion of target-state membership in international institutions and regimes<br/>Summit meetings and other visits by the head of state and other senior government officials of sender state to target state and vice-versa<br/>MILITARY CONTACTS<br/>Visits of senior military officials of the sender state to the target state and vice-versa<br/>Arms transfers<br/>Military aid and cooperation<br/>Military exchange and training programs<br/>Confidence and security-building measures<br/>Intelligence sharing<br/>ECONOMIC CONTACTS<br/>Trade agreements and promotion<br/>Foreign economic and humanitarian aid in the form of loans and/or grants<br/>CULTURAL CONTACTS<br/>Cultural treaties<br/>Inauguration of travel and tourism links<br/>Sport, artistic and academic exchanges (n25)<br/>Engagement is an iterated process in which the sender and target state develop a relationship <br/>AND<br/>hope that this will precipitate political change from below within the target state.<br/>This definition implies that three necessary conditions must hold for engagement to constitute an effective <br/>AND<br/>, and the near-total collapse of its national economy.(n28)<br/>Third, the target state must perceive the engager and the international order it represents as a potential source of the material or prestige resources it desires. This means that autarkic, revolutionary and unlimited regimes which eschew the norms and institutions of the prevailing order, such as Stalin’s Soviet Union or Hitler’s Germany, will not be seduced by the potential benefits of engagement.<br/>This reformulated conceptualization avoids the pitfalls of prevailing scholarly conceptions of engagement. It considers the policy as a set of means rather than ends, does not delimit the types of states that can either engage or be engaged, explicitly encompasses contacts in multiple issue-areas, allows for the existence of multiple objectives in any given instance of engagement and, as will be shown below, permits the elucidation of multiple types of positive sanctions.</p><p>Focus on detention in the war on terror erases the everyday violence of the American carceral machine<br/>Veeren 12 <br/>(Elspeth Van Veeren is a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in International Relations at the University of Sussex, ’Clean War, Invisible War, Liberal War: The Clean and Dirty Politics of Guantánamo’, Chapter in Democracies at War, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://academia.edu/1990191/Clean_War_Invisible_War_Liberal_War)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://academia.edu/1990191/Clean_War_Invisible_War_Liberal_War)%27" tppabs="http://academia.edu/1990191/Clean_War_Invisible_War_Liberal_War)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://academia.edu/1990191/Clean_War_Invisible_War_Liberal_War)</span></a></span></p><p>In that sense, Guanta?namo, defined as exceptional, also helped to erase and <br/>AND<br/>historical and more everyday sights and spaces, ones often based on race.<br/>For example, many of the guards who worked at Guanta?namo were part of a <br/>AND<br/>to be a scene of so much (often invisible) violence.37</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>Despite their best intentions, the Aff simply works to shore up the crumbling myth of US moral virtue that enables endless war, global structural violence and simply shifts the prison to the global scale<br/>McCulloch (Professor of Criminology at Monash University, Melbourne) 10 <br/>(Jude, From garrison state to garrison planet: state terror, the War on Terror and the rise of a global carceral complex, Contemporary State Terrorism Theory and practice, 196-213)&nbsp;</p><p>In the same way that neoliberalism and punitive penal policy have marched hand-in-hand domestically the spread of neoliberal globalization has extended and intensified this process throughout the world.

First, Middle Eastern leaders, like politicians everywhere, are primarily interested in one thing: self-preservation. Committing forces to Iraq is an inherently risky proposition, which, if the conflict went badly, could threaten domestic political stability. Moreover, most Arab armies are geared toward regime protection rather than projecting power and thus have little capability for sending troops to Iraq.<br/>Second, there is cause for concern about the so-called blowback scenario in which jihadis returning from Iraq destabilize their home countries, plunging the region into conflict.<br/>Middle Eastern leaders are preparing for this possibility. Unlike in the 1990s, when Arab fighters in the Afghan jihad against the Soviet Union returned to Algeria, Egypt and Saudi Arabia and became a source of instability, Arab security services are being vigilant about who is coming in and going from their countries.<br/>In the last month, the Saudi government has arrested approximately 200 people suspected of ties with militants. Riyadh is also building a 700 kilometer wall along part of its frontier with Iraq in order to keep militants out of the kingdom.<br/>Finally, there is no precedent for Arab leaders to commit forces to conflicts in <br/>AND<br/>Lebanese. The civil war in Lebanon was regarded as someone else’s fight.<br/>Indeed, this is the way many leaders view the current situation in Iraq. To Cairo, Amman and Riyadh, the situation in Iraq is worrisome, but in the end it is an Iraqi and American fight.<br/>As far as Iranian mullahs are concerned, they have long preferred to press their interests through proxies as opposed to direct engagement. At a time when Tehran has access and influence over powerful Shiite militias, a massive cross-border incursion is both unlikely and unnecessary.<br/>So Iraqis will remain locked in a sectarian and ethnic struggle that outside powers may abet, but will remain within the borders of Iraq.<br/>The Middle East is a region both prone and accustomed to civil wars. But given its experience with ambiguous conflicts, the region has also developed an intuitive ability to contain its civil strife and prevent local conflicts from enveloping the entire Middle East.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="Hnoglobalescalation" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>no global escalation</span></h4><p>Dyer 02 – Ph.D. in Military and Middle Eastern History from the University of London and former professor at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst and Oxford University (Gwynne, Queen’s Quarterly, "The coming war", December, questia)</p><p>All of this indicates an extremely dangerous situation, with many variables that are impossible <br/>AND<br/>.

In recent years, engagement constituted the Clinton administration’s declared approach in the conduct of bilateral relations with such countries as China, Russia, North Korea and Vietnam.<br/>Robert Suettinger, a onetime member of the Clinton administration’s National Security Council, remarked that the word engagement has "been overused and poorly defined by a variety of policymakers and speechwriters" and has "become shopworn to the point that there is little agreement on what it actually means."(n2) The Clinton foreign policy team attributed five distinct meanings to engagement<img src="../../resources/icons/silk/emoticon_unhappy.png" tppabs="http://hspolicy13.debatecoaches.org/resources/icons/silk/emoticon_unhappy.png" class="wikimodel-freestanding" alt="emoticon_unhappy"/>n3)<br/>A broad-based grand strategic orientation: In this sense, engagement is considered synonymous with American internationalism and global leadership. For example, in a 1993 speech, National Security Advisor Anthony Lake observed that American public opinion was divided into two rival camps: "On the one side is protectionism and limited foreign engagement; on the other is active American engagement abroad on behalf of democracy and expanded trade."(n4)<br/>A specific approach to managing bilateral relations with a target state through the unconditional provision of continuous concessions to that state: During the 1992 presidential campaign, candidate Bill Clinton criticized the Bush administration’s "ill-advised and failed" policy of "constructive engagement" toward China as one that "coddled the dictators and pleaded for progress, but refused to impose penalties for intransigence."(n5)<br/>A bilateral policy characterized by the conditional provision of concessions to a target state: <br/>AND<br/>in exchange for a freeze in the North’s nuclear weapons program.(n7)<br/>A bilateral policy characterized by the broadening of contacts in areas of mutual interest with <br/>AND<br/>areas of agreement and...develop policies to manage our differences."(n9)<br/>A bilateral policy characterized by the provision of technical assistance to facilitate economic and political <br/>AND<br/>and~ to advance human rights and the rule of law."(n10)<br/>Unfortunately, scholars have not fared better than policymakers in the effort to conceptualize engagement because they often make at least one of the following critical errors: (1) treating engagement as a synonym for appeasement; (2) defining engagement so expansively that it essentially constitutes any policy relying on positive sanctions; (3) defining engagement in an unnecessarily restrictive manner.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>Topic education – blurring the line of "economic" creates definitional chaos that precludes any understanding of engagement – here is intent to define<br/>van Bergeijk 11 – Dr. Peter A.G. van Bergeijk, Professor of International Economics and Macroeconomics at the Institute of Social Studies at Erasmus University, Economic Diplomacy: Economic and Political Perspectives, p. 8-9</p><p>Clearly, there is a need for improved understanding of economic diplomacy’s activities, tools <br/>AND<br/>use economic tools and commercial relations to strengthen their position in international politics.<br/>The proposed (re)definition of economic diplomacy adds to the existing literature by <br/>AND<br/>1R), economics, international political economics (IPE), and diplomatic studies.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HImpossibletoprovewarmingduetofluctuation-talkisjustpolitics" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Impossible to prove warming due to fluctuation - talk is just politics</span></h4><p><strong>Darwall, 7/18&nbsp;</strong>- graduate of Cambridge and author of The Age of Global Warming (Rupert, "Global Warming- From Science to Agitprop", July 18<sup>th</sup>, 2013, Huffington Post, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/rupert-darwall/global-warming_b_3615720.html)//SQR  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/rupert-darwall/global-warming_b_3615720.html)//SQR%27" tppabs="http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/rupert-darwall/global-warming_b_3615720.html)//SQR"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/rupert-darwall/global-warming_b_3615720.html)//SQR</span></a></span><br/>’We seem to be losing the communications battle,’ the Met Office’s chief scientist <br/>AND<br/>and include the demotion of the scientific standards established by the Scientific Revolution.&nbsp;</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HNoscientificsupportforglobalwarminghypothesis" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>No scientific support for global warming hypothesis</span></h4><p><strong>Armstong 11&nbsp;</strong>– Professor @ U Wharton School<br/>J.

From securitisation to militarisation 3.1 Complicity</p><p>This analysis thus calls for a broader approach to environmental security based on retrieving the manner in which political actors construct discourses of ’scarcity’ in response to ecological, energy and economic crises (critical security studies) in the context of the historically-specific socio-political and geopolitical relations of domination by which their power is constituted, and which are often implicated in the acceleration of these very crises (historical sociology and historical materialism).<br/>Instead, both realist and liberal orthodox IR approaches focus on different aspects of interstate <br/>AND<br/>the economy in society and the concomitant politically-constituted nature of economics.<br/>Hence, they neglect the profound irrationality of collective state behaviour, which systematically erodes <br/>AND<br/>realism and liberalism are ideologically implicated in the acceleration of global systemic crises.<br/>By the same token, the incapacity to recognise and critically interrogate how prevailing social<br/>AND<br/>fuels the proliferation of violent conflict and militarisation responsible for magnified global insecurity.<br/>’Securitisation’ refers to a ’speech act’ - an act of labelling - whereby political authorities <br/>AND<br/>-legal military-police measures in purported response to an existential danger.<br/>The problem in the context of global ecological, economic and energy crises is that <br/>AND<br/>responding to global systemic crises other than to reduce them to their symptoms.<br/>Indeed, orthodox IR theory has largely responded to global systemic crises not with new <br/>AND<br/>capacities to maintain existing power structures, to keep the lid on.93<br/>Global crises are thus viewed as amplifying factors that could mobilise the popular will in <br/>AND<br/>problematise potentially recalcitrant populations - rationalising violence toward them as a control mechanism.<br/>Consequently, for the most part, the policy implications of orthodox IR approaches involve <br/>AND<br/>a ’threat-multiplier which exacerbates existing trends, tensions and instability’.95<br/>In practice, this generates an excessive preoccupation not with the causes of global crisis <br/>AND<br/>stressors by generating humanitarian crises, population migrations and other complex emergencies.96<br/>A similar study by the US Joint Forces Command draws attention to the danger of <br/>AND<br/>resources and skills to shape transnational processes in their own class interest.’99<br/>Thus, the securitisation of global crisis leads not only to the problematisation of particular <br/>AND</p><ul><li>by dominating a resource-rich region critical for global capitalism.100<br/>But even this does not go far enough, for arguably the construction of certain <br/>AND<br/>, religious, political or economic lines — eventually legitimising their annihilation.102<br/>In other words, genocidal violence is inherently rooted in a prior and ongoing ideological <br/>AND<br/>from which that programme derives can the emergence of genocidal intent become explicable.<br/>Building on this insight, Semelin demonstrates that the process of exclusionary social group construction <br/>AND<br/>genocide, can become legitimised as contributing to the resolution of crises.105<br/>This does not imply that the securitisation of global crises by Western defence agencies is <br/>AND<br/>for crisis onto a newly constructed ’outsider’ group vindicating various forms of violence.</li></ul><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HDon2019tcallitanalternative2014-ourresponseistointerrogatetheepistemologicalfailuresofthe1ac2014-thisisaprereqtosuccessfulpolicy" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Don’t call it an alternative—-our response is to interrogate the epistemological failures of the 1ac—-this is a prereq to successful policy</span></h4><p>Ahmed 12 Dr. Nafeez Mosaddeq Ahmed is Executive Director of the Institute for Policy Research and Development (IPRD), an independent think tank focused on the study of violent conflict, he has taught at the Department of International Relations, University of Sussex "The international relations of crisis and the crisis of international relations: from the securitisation of scarcity to the militarisation of society" Global Change, Peace 26 Security Volume 23, Issue 3, 2011 Taylor Francis</p><p>While recommendations to shift our frame of orientation away from conventional state-centrism toward <br/>AND<br/>of state security planning in the context of counter-terrorism operations abroad.<br/>The intensifying problematisation and externalisation of Muslim-majority regions and populations by Western security <br/>AND<br/>the efficacy of the prevailing geopolitical and economic order is ideologically beyond question.<br/>As much as this analysis highlights a direct link between global systemic crises, social polarisation and state militarisation, it fundamentally undermines the idea of a symbiotic link between natural resources and conflict per se.

To understand that this possibility exists is one thing; to understand that the process of destabilization has already begun is another. Many analysts with their heads stuck in the mainstream clouds attempt to argue against the "theory" of foreign markets decoupling from the U.S., not realizing that their entire debate platform is pointless because the decoupling is happening right under their noses… The recent press covering the ongoing plan by BRIC nations (or "BRICS" if you count the latest bilateral agreements with South Africa) to establish their own supranational banking hub merely highlights the fact that developing countries are not simply "talking" about decoupling from the United States, they are taking actions to make it happen: <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-16/goldman-sachs-s-o-neill-sees-brics-bank-gathering-momentum-1-.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-16/goldman-sachs-s-o-neill-sees-brics-bank-gathering-momentum-1-.html%27" tppabs="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-16/goldman-sachs-s-o-neill-sees-brics-bank-gathering-momentum-1-.html"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-16/goldman-sachs-s-o-neill-sees-brics-bank-gathering-momentum-1-.html</span></a></span> The response from mainstream financial analysts is, of course, that the project for a BRIC bank will fail. Their argument, however, usually revolves around the assumption that this new central bank is designed to "compete" with the IMF, and is a merely an overreaction to the IMF and World Bank’s failure to give developing nations more inclusion in decision making processes. I see no evidence that the BRICS are trying to create a counter-system which would conflict with IMF control. Instead, it would seem that the BRICS are much more interested in forcing the issue of greater inclusion, and garnering greater favor within the already existing IMF structure: <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/04/19/imf-idUSL2E8FJ90K20120419  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/04/19/imf-idUSL2E8FJ90K20120419%27" tppabs="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/04/19/imf-idUSL2E8FJ90K20120419"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/04/19/imf-idUSL2E8FJ90K20120419</span></a></span> Last year the G20 discussed heightened participation by China and the BRICS in the IMF’s global basket currency, the SDR.

Simply put: Bias, controlled and pre-written talking points from their editors, as well as many half-baked presumptions. The popular belief amongst financial academia is that the IMF is a product of American economic might, and that the organization will do whatever is in the best interests of the U.S. at all times. The reality is that the IMF is fast becoming the central authority of economic operations around the globe, and America just happens to be paying the largest "tithe" to the respective coffers of the banking syndicate. Do you get more control in the operations of the IRS when you pay more taxes? The IMF’s goal is world centralization of economic control. For them, any sovereign nation is expendable in pursuit of the end game, including the United States. The IMF would not be pushing the issuance of a new world reserve currency to unseat the dollar if they did not intend to follow through, and they certainly would not hobble the greenback if they cared in the slightest about American economic concerns. Rather than running counter to the IMF, BRIC partners and the newly realized ASEAN bloc are making themselves indispensible to the globalists, ensuring wider partnership in the near future. A BRIC central bank is, I believe, a bargaining chip to be used to open the door to more leadership in the IMF while reducing American influence. To summarize, the BRICS are not in conflict with the IMF, rather, they are in conflict with the U.S., and this conflict is coming to a climax… Trade amongst BRIC nations continues to climb while exports to the U.S. have diminished. Between 2001 and 2009, exports and imports between BRICS skyrocketed, even amidst the derivatives collapse:</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HAltcause2013theGOPhateeducationfunding3Bthisisthelynchpintosolvepoverty" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Alt cause – the GOP hate education funding; this is the lynchpin to solve poverty</span></h4><p>All Voices 8/1 – media site for Breaking News, Current Events, Latest News and World Events (Why conservatives will never end poverty in America, 8/1/12, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.allvoices.com/contributed-news/12700990-why-conservatives-will-never-end-poverty-in-america)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.allvoices.com/contributed-news/12700990-why-conservatives-will-never-end-poverty-in-america)%27" tppabs="http://www.allvoices.com/contributed-news/12700990-why-conservatives-will-never-end-poverty-in-america)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.allvoices.com/contributed-news/12700990-why-conservatives-will-never-end-poverty-in-america)</span></a></span> <em>&nbsp;czhang<br/>The very nature of poverty in America is counter to pro-big business conservative philosophy.

John Stock well, who was part of a CIA project in Angola which led to the deaths of over 20,000 people, puts it like this:<br/>Coming to grips with these U.S./CIA activities in broad numbers and <br/>AND<br/>I was part of – and 22,000 killed in Nicaragua.109<br/>Note that the six million is a minimum figure, that he omits to mention <br/>AND<br/>the world, and launched a new round of slaughtering to prove it.<br/>While much has been made about the supposedly ’new’ doctrine of preemption in the <br/>AND<br/>, the United States will, if necessary, act pre emptively.110<br/>In other words, the security policy of the world’s only superpower in its current ’war on terror’ is still underpinned by a notion of liberal order-building based on a certain vision of ’economic order’. The National Security Strategy concerns itself with a ’single sustainable model for national success’ based on ’political and economic liberty’, with whole sections devoted to the security benefits of ’economic liberty’, and the benefits to liberty of the security strategy proposed.111<br/>Economic security (that is, ’capitalist accumulation’) in the guise of ’<br/>AND<br/>apparatus intimately bound up with national identity and thus the politics of loyalty.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HTheirinput-outputunderstandingoftheeconomydoesn2019taccountforthecomplexityofhumanbehavior2013theirpredictionsbecomeself-referentialandfail" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Their input-output understanding of the economy doesn’t account for the complexity of human behavior – their predictions become self-referential and fail</span></h4><p>Arthur 95 – W.
