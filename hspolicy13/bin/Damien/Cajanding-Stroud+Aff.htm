They are often taken over by foreign-owned corporations holding huge supplies of our wealth generated through their trade surplus with us.<br/>Japanese, Chinese, German, Swiss, Dutch, English and other countries’ corporations have purchased much of Wall Street in the last decade. Very few American-owned companies produce audio and electronic products. Many products that America claims to manufacture are in actuality assembled here, their components consisting of more imports.<br/>The American electronics industry is now largely foreign-owned. The vast majorly (nearly all) of electronics, parts and products, are made in Asia.<br/>The decline of America’s manufacturing industry also poses a national security concern. U.S. defense industries are becoming ever more dependent on foreign manufacturers for key components and materials. Unfortunately, as imports have flooded our markets since the 1980s, U.S. producers one by one exited the country.<br/>We call ourselves a superpower. How strong are we when we can’t produce what we need to maintain our strength? We must reverse this trend. We must develop an industrial policy to create incentives for American companies to manufacture in America. We must invigorate strategic industries and prevent their sale to foreign ownership.

After meeting with stakeholders and local officials in communities all along the border I, along with then-U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, asked the Government Accountability Office to conduct a review of our ports of entry.<br/>The report was released in July and confirms what local leaders, businesses and residents on the border already know: Our ports of entry have been neglected for too long. Border wait times are under-reported, infrastructure and staff are mismanaged and stretched too thin, and it is becoming harder to ensure safe and efficient trade and travel.<br/>Highways are the arteries of commerce, and our ports of entry are the valves that regulate its flow. Currently, they are clogged, and this is needlessly harming the economy while effectively making it easier to smuggle contraband into the country. A Bloomberg government study found that border delays cost the U.S. economy $7.8 billion in 2011. If corrective action is not taken, the annual damage is projected to rise to $14.7 billion by 2020.<br/>We must fix this.<br/>I authored an amendment to the immigration bill that passed the Senate earlier this summer that aimed to achieve a reduction in wait times by 50 percent at our ports of entry. Unfortunately, it did not muster the 60 votes needed for adoption. But with renewed attention to the issue generated by the GAO report, I remain hopeful that a fix will be an integral part of the immigration debate.<br/>Nevertheless, a fix need not be tied to the fate of immigration reform. Cities, counties and private bridge owners want their bridges to stay open longer and accommodate more traffic. Unfortunately, Customs and Border Protection doesn’t have the resources, and Washington lacks the will to offer much help.<br/>In response, organizations such as the Border Trade Alliance, Texas Border Coalition and other local stakeholders are exploring an innovative funding option: public-private partnerships. These would combine the resources of CBP with local governments and private companies or associations to improve services and conditions at ports of entry.<br/>On the heels of the GAO report, CBP announced that it would initiate five such partnerships – four of which are in Texas – on a limited, provisional basis. This is commendable, but more needs to be done. CBP currently lacks the legal authority to enter into the long-term, robust agreements that are needed.<br/>Earlier this year, I authored legislation, the Cross Border Trade Enhancement Act, which would give CBP the authority it needs. If signed into law, we would see such partnerships established in the Valley in short order.<br/>Looking forward, I see reason for optimism. CBP is aware of the problem and seems willing to act. Communities along the border are eager to participate, and the GAO report will draw the attention of lawmakers as the immigration debate continues. I hope that the Obama administration will work with local leaders and with me to bring about these much needed upgrades to our ports of entry.<br/>Until we do so, however, we cannot harness our full economic potential.<br/>Fed key – ensures funding, coordination, resources, and cross-border dialogue<br/>Lee et al. 13<br/>Erik Lee, Christopher E.

Cilluffo, Director of the Homeland Security Policy Institute at GWU, September 18, 2013, “Understanding the Thrreat to the Homeland from AQAP”, Pg. 1-3 AS</p><p>Why AQAP Matters<br/>• AQAP is the most active of al Qaeda’s affiliate groups. AQAP has directly targeted the<br/>U.S. homeland as well as U.S. interests abroad on multiple occasions.<br/>• AQAP (and Yemen) is home to one of the world’s most dangerous and innovative bombmakers who has actively tried and shown himself to be able to circumvent U.S. countermeasures intended to thwart his improvised explosive devices.<br/>• AQAP has invested significantly in encouraging radicalization and “lone wolf” homegrown attacks, including “Inspire” magazine. AQAP’s efforts in this regard propagate the ideology that underpins al Qaeda as a movement, and provide the “howto” do it yourself in terrorist tactics, techniques, and procedures.<br/>• AQAP is currently led by Nasser al-Wuhayshi, formerly a direct confidant of Osama bin<br/>Laden, who was recently named the number two figure within al Qaeda writ large. The number two leadership slot is symbolically important but also operationally so, particularly as the boundaries between al Qaeda components (core and affiliates) fade away and their activities converge.<br/>• AQAP has for some time assumed a leadership role within al Qaeda as a whole, and has cooperated with multiple al Qaeda affiliates. AQAP’s leadership position offers a conduit to foster intent in others to attack the U.S. homeland and U.S. interests.<br/>AQAP was established in 2009 by the merger of Yemeni al Qaeda with Saudi al <br/>AND<br/>bomb attempt in which explosives were concealed in printer cartridges; and the spring<br/>2012 concealed explosives plot.1 The first two of these attempted attacks were overseen <br/>AND<br/>as the mastermind behind the devices used in the 2009 attempted assassination of the<br/>Saudi Interior Minister, the 2009 Christmas Day attack, the 2010 cargo printer bomb, and plots that involve surgically implanted explosives.<br/>Over and above his own considerable expertise, al-Asiri has been training the next generation of bomb-makers.4 AQAP has also expressed an interest in attacks using biological warfare agents, including ricin.5<br/>The border is uniquely susceptible to al-Qaeda – even the Department of Homeland Security concedes terrorists slip through<br/>Murdock 13<br/>Deroy Murdock, Columnist @ Scripps Howard News Service, Media Fellow @ Hoover Institution on War, Revolution, and Peace @ Stanford University, April 25, 2013, National Review, “The Southern Border: Our Welcome Mat for Terrorists” <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.nationalreview.com/article/346591/southern-border-our-welcome-mat-terrorists  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.nationalreview.com/article/346591/southern-border-our-welcome-mat-terrorists%27" tppabs="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/346591/southern-border-our-welcome-mat-terrorists"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.nationalreview.com/article/346591/southern-border-our-welcome-mat-terrorists</span></a></span></p><p>There are at least 7,518 reasons to get the U.S./<br/>AND<br/>No details exist about aliens from these countries who successfully have infiltrated America.<br/>This presents a serious nuke terror threat – they can smuggle materials piece by piece<br/>McCaul 12<br/>Michael T.

Most of them are American and manufacture parts for companies like Honeywell, Goodrich and Gulfstream.<br/>They produce a wide variety of items, from electronic components, air conditioning systems, and cable harnesses, to steel bolts for commercial and military aircraft. Their advantage is the proximity to the United States and to Western ports that ship to the Asian markets. They have access to a large, high-tech workforce in Tijuana, made up of engineers, technicians and software developers.<br/>But the main reason the companies come to Baja is simple: The cost of that highly skilled labor is low — about one-third of what it is in the U.S.<br/>Currently, the Baja aerospace industry employs more than 10,000 machine operators and technicians. And that number has been growing steadily since 2007, when Mexico dropped import duties on aeronautics components.
