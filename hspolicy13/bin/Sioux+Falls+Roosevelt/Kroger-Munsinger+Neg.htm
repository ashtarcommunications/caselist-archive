Raúl Castro represent a genuine political opening toward greater freedom.<br/>If anything, things are getting worse. The report, which covers 2012, says the independent Cuban Commission on Human Rights and Reconciliation counted 6,602 short-term detentions during the year, compared with 4,123 in 2011. In March 2012, the same commission recorded a 30-year record high of 1,158 short-term detentions in a single month just before the visit of Pope Benedict XVI.<br/>Among the many abuses cited by the 2012 report are the prison sentences handed out to members of the Unión Patriotica de Cuba, the estimated 3,000 citizens held under the charge of "potential dangerousness," state-orchestrated assaults against the Damas de Blanco (Ladies in White), the suspicious death of dissident Oswaldo Payá and so on.<br/>As in any dictatorship, telling the truth is a crime: Independent journalist Calixto Ramón Martínez Arias, the first to report on the cholera outbreak in Cuba, was jailed in September for the crime of desacato (insulting speech) and remained there until last week.<br/>The regime is willing to undertake some meek economic reforms to keep people employed. It has even dared to relax its travel requirements to allow more Cubans to leave the country if they can get a passport.<br/>Both of these are short-term survival measures, designed as escape valves for growing internal pressure. But when it comes to free speech, political activity and freedom of association — the building blocks of a free society — the report is a depressing chronicle of human-rights abuses and a valuable reminder that repression is the Castro regime’s only response to those who demand a genuinely free Cuba. Fundamental reform? Not a chance.</p><h4 id="HRejecttheaff-Moraldutytoshunhumanrightsabusers" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Reject the aff- Moral duty to shun human rights abusers</span></h4><p><strong>Beversluis 89</strong> — Eric H.

If we both want the <br/>AND<br/>rage. Thus ethics identifies the rights of individuals when their interests conflict.<br/>But how can a case for shunning be made on this view of morality? <br/>AND<br/>, on what grounds might it be a duty to impose such sanctions?<br/>We find the answer when we note that there is another "level" of <br/>AND<br/>rights of others with one’s actions but also to support that moral order.<br/>Consider that the moral order itself contributes significantly to people’s rights being respected. It <br/>AND<br/>it indirectly affects people’s rights. And this is where shunning fits in.<br/>Certain types of behavior constitute a direct attack on the moral order. When the <br/>AND<br/>three conditions which turn immoral behavior into an attack on the moral order.<br/>An immoral action is flagrant if it is "extremely or deliberately conspicuous; notorious<br/>AND<br/>reaffirms the legitimacy of that moral order. How does shunning do this?<br/>First, by refusing publicly to have to do with such a person one announces support for the moral order and backs up the announcement with action. This action reinforces the commitment to the moral order both of the shunner and of the other members of the community. (Secretary of State Shultz in effect made this argument in his call for international sanctions on Libya in the early days of 1986.)<br/>Further, shunning may have a moral effect on the shunned person, even if the direct impact is not adequate to change the immoral behavior. If the shunned person thinks of herself as part of the moral community, shunning may well make clear to her that she is, in fact, removing herself from that community by the behavior in question. Thus shunning may achieve by moral suasion what cannot be achieved by "force."<br/>Finally, shunning may be a form of punishment, of moral sanction, whose appropriateness depends not on whether it will change the person’s behavior, but on whether he deserves the punishment for violating the moral order. Punishment then can be viewed as a way of maintaining the moral order, of "purifying the community" after it has been made "unclean," as ancient communities might have put it.<br/>Yet not every immoral action requires that we shun.

The Banking Committee oversees sanctions legislation in the Senate.<br/>"We should not do anything counterproductive that might shatter Western unity on this issue," Johnson said at a hearing.<br/>"We should make sure that if the talks fail, it was Iran that caused their failure. We should not give Iran, the P5+1 countries or other nations a pretext to lay responsibility for their collapse on us," he said.<br/>Iran’s foreign minister also has said a new sanctions law would kill the interim agreement reached in Geneva on November 24. In that agreement, Tehran agreed to limit uranium enrichment in return for an easing of international sanctions.<br/>The administration’s push to hold off on sanctions gained further momentum when other senators - including senior Republicans - said they did not expect action now.<br/>"I realized we’re sort of going through a rope-a-dope here in the Senate and that we’re not actually going to do anything," said Senator Bob Corker, the top Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee and a member of the Banking panel.<br/>Underscoring the administration’s insistence that it is not backing down on Iran, the U.S. Treasury Department announced shortly before the Banking Committee hearing that it had blacklisted several companies and individuals for supporting Iran’s nuclear program.<br/>TALKS CONTINUE<br/>The P5+1 powers who negotiated the interim deal on Iran’s nuclear program - Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States - are continuing negotiations with a goal of reaching a comprehensive final deal in six months.<br/>Johnson also said he and Senator Mike Crapo, the top Republican on the Banking panel, had crafted a new sanctions bill, not to pass now, but to be put into effect if Iran does not comply with the Geneva agreement or negotiations collapse.<br/>"I am holding back ... simply because of the administration’s request," Crapo told reporters after the hearing.<br/>Crapo said he believed in strong sanctions but had not decided how he would vote if a group of more hawkish senators led by Democrat Robert Menendez and Republican Mark Kirk pursued a plan to introduce sanctions legislation without going through the Banking Committee.<br/>Menendez said at the banking hearing that he remained deeply skeptical about Iran and said the Senate might need to pass a resolution spelling out what it sees as terms of an acceptable final agreement with Iran.<br/>The Obama administration is eager to remind companies hoping for an opening to do business with Iran that sanctions that have crippled the country’s economy remain in place.<br/>"We are very actively dissuading international oil companies and others who think that now may be a time to test the waters in Iran," David Cohen, undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence for the Treasury Department, said at the hearing.</p><h4 id="H7Einsertlink7E" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>~insert link~</span></h4><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HSanctionsbillcausesIranprolif-1" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Sanctions bill causes Iran prolif</span></h4><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p><strong>Grijalva and Gould 12/12</strong><br/>Don’t Sabotage the Iran Deal<br/>By RAÚL GRIJALVA , KATE GOULD <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/world-report/2013/12/12/preventing-a-nuclear-iran-means-opposing-more-sanctions-now  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/world-report/2013/12/12/preventing-a-nuclear-iran-means-opposing-more-sanctions-now%27" tppabs="http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/world-report/2013/12/12/preventing-a-nuclear-iran-means-opposing-more-sanctions-now"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/world-report/2013/12/12/preventing-a-nuclear-iran-means-opposing-more-sanctions-now</span></a></span></p><p>If Congress isn’t careful, it will sabotage our country’s best opportunity to prevent war and a nuclear-armed Iran. The campaign to establish excessive new sanctions risks blowing up the preliminary deal reached to limit Iran’s nuclear program before it’s even gone into effect.<br/>If neither Congress nor Iranian hardliners get in the way, this agreement will freeze Iran’s nuclear progress for the first time in a decade. Key parts of Iran’s nuclear program will be stopped or rolled back for six months, and Iran will submit to unprecedented inspections.<br/>In return, Iran gets modest relief from existing sanctions and a commitment by the United States and our partners to refrain from adding any new ones. This six-month window gives our diplomats the space to hammer out a comprehensive settlement to guarantee Iran does not develop a nuclear weapon.<br/>The deal our diplomats negotiated with Iran is a landmark achievement for advancing America’s national security interests and strengthening the global non-proliferation regime.

Raúl Castro represent a genuine political opening toward greater freedom.<br/>If anything, things are getting worse. The report, which covers 2012, says the independent Cuban Commission on Human Rights and Reconciliation counted 6,602 short-term detentions during the year, compared with 4,123 in 2011. In March 2012, the same commission recorded a 30-year record high of 1,158 short-term detentions in a single month just before the visit of Pope Benedict XVI.<br/>Among the many abuses cited by the 2012 report are the prison sentences handed out to members of the Unión Patriotica de Cuba, the estimated 3,000 citizens held under the charge of "potential dangerousness," state-orchestrated assaults against the Damas de Blanco (Ladies in White), the suspicious death of dissident Oswaldo Payá and so on.<br/>As in any dictatorship, telling the truth is a crime: Independent journalist Calixto Ramón Martínez Arias, the first to report on the cholera outbreak in Cuba, was jailed in September for the crime of desacato (insulting speech) and remained there until last week.<br/>The regime is willing to undertake some meek economic reforms to keep people employed. It has even dared to relax its travel requirements to allow more Cubans to leave the country if they can get a passport.<br/>Both of these are short-term survival measures, designed as escape valves for growing internal pressure. But when it comes to free speech, political activity and freedom of association — the building blocks of a free society — the report is a depressing chronicle of human-rights abuses and a valuable reminder that repression is the Castro regime’s only response to those who demand a genuinely free Cuba.

Beversluis, Professor of Philosophy and Economics at Aquinas College, holds an A.B. in Philosophy and German from Calvin College, an M.A. in Philosophy from Northwestern University, an M.A. in Economics from Ohio State University, and a Ph.D. in the Philosophy of Education from Northwestern University, 1989 ("On Shunning Undesirable Regimes: Ethics and Economic Sanctions," Public Affairs Quarterly, Volume 3, Number 2, April, Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via JSTOR, p. 17-19)<br/>A fundamental task of morality is resolving conflicting interests. If we both want the <br/>AND<br/>rage. Thus ethics identifies the rights of individuals when their interests conflict.<br/>But how can a case for shunning be made on this view of morality? <br/>AND<br/>, on what grounds might it be a duty to impose such sanctions?<br/>We find the answer when we note that there is another "level" of <br/>AND<br/>rights of others with one’s actions but also to support that moral order.<br/>Consider that the moral order itself contributes significantly to people’s rights being respected. It <br/>AND<br/>it indirectly affects people’s rights. And this is where shunning fits in.<br/>Certain types of behavior constitute a direct attack on the moral order. When the <br/>AND<br/>three conditions which turn immoral behavior into an attack on the moral order.<br/>An immoral action is flagrant if it is "extremely or deliberately conspicuous; notorious<br/>AND<br/>reaffirms the legitimacy of that moral order. How does shunning do this?<br/>First, by refusing publicly to have to do with such a person one announces support for the moral order and backs up the announcement with action. This action reinforces the commitment to the moral order both of the shunner and of the other members of the community. (Secretary of State Shultz in effect made this argument in his call for international sanctions on Libya in the early days of 1986.)<br/>Further, shunning may have a moral effect on the shunned person, even if the direct impact is not adequate to change the immoral behavior. If the shunned person thinks of herself as part of the moral community, shunning may well make clear to her that she is, in fact, removing herself from that community by the behavior in question. Thus shunning may achieve by moral suasion what cannot be achieved by "force."<br/>Finally, shunning may be a form of punishment, of moral sanction, whose appropriateness depends not on whether it will change the person’s behavior, but on whether he deserves the punishment for violating the moral order. Punishment then can be viewed as a way of maintaining the moral order, of "purifying the community" after it has been made "unclean," as ancient communities might have put it.<br/>Yet not every immoral action requires that we shun. As noted above, we <br/>AND<br/>on the moral order itself through flagrant, willful, and persistent wrongdoing. <br/>We can also now see why failure to shun can under certain circumstances suggest complicity. But it is not that we have a duty to shun because failure to do so suggests complicity. Rather, because we have an obligation to shun in certain circumstances, when we fail to do so others may interpret our failure as tacit complicity in the willful, persistent, and flagrant immorality.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HText:TheUnitedStatesfederalgovernmentsubstantiallyeaseitseconomicrestrictionsontheRepublicofCuba.ifandonlyiftheRepublicofCubaagreestocombathumanrightsabuses" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Text: The &nbsp;United States federal government substantially ease its economic restrictions on the Republic of Cuba. if and only if the Republic of Cuba agrees to combat human rights abuses</span></h4><h4 id="HWeshouldcontinuetodemandsignificantreformsbeforerelaxingU.S.policy-1" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>We should continue to demand significant reforms before relaxing U.S. policy</span></h4><p>José R. <strong>Cárdenas</strong>, Nov. 13, <strong>’12</strong>, an associate with the consulting firm VisionAmericas, former Acting Assistant Administrator for Latin America and the Caribbean and Senior Advisor at the Organization of American States and as a senior professional staff member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, "Cuba policy in a second Obama term," Foreign Policy, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://shadow.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/11/13/cuba_policy_in_a_second_obama_term  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://shadow.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/11/13/cuba_policy_in_a_second_obama_term%27" tppabs="http://shadow.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/11/13/cuba_policy_in_a_second_obama_term"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://shadow.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/11/13/cuba_policy_in_a_second_obama_term</span></a></span>, ACC. 6-1-2013, JT<em>JEDI<br/>Secondly, critics have convinced themselves that if it weren’t for the Cuban American lobby, the U.S. would have long ago reached an accommodation with the Castro dictatorship.

"Cuba had to produce twice as much food, with less than half the chemical inputs," according to the COSG. Land was switched from export crops to food production, and tractors were switched for oxen. People were encouraged to move from the city to the land and organic farming methods were introduced. <br/>"Integrated pest management, crop rotation, composting and soil conservation were implemented," says the COSG. The country had to become expert in techniques like worm composting and biopesticides. "Worms and worm farm technology is now a Cuban export," says Dr Stephen Wilkinson, assistant director of the International Institute for the Study of Cuba.<br/>Thus, the unique system of organoponicos, or urban organic farming, was started<br/>AND<br/>says, food intake is back at 2,600 calories a day.<br/>Organoponico plaza<br/>A visit to Havana’s largest organoponico, the three-hectare Organoponico Plaza, which lies a stone’s throw from the city’s Plaza de la Revolución and the desk of Raul Castro, confirms that the scheme is doing well. Rows of strikingly neat irrigated raised beds are home to seasonal crops of lettuces, spring onions, chives, garlic and parsley. <br/>Guava and noni fruit trees provide shade around the perimeter, while on the far side compost piles sit next to plastic tunnels used to raise seedlings. Outside in the shop, signs extol the virtues of eating your greens. <br/>The shop is open only on Mondays. Produce is sold by the people who work the garden (they keep 50 of sales, so are motivated to produce a lot) to the people who live nearby. In this case, the organoponico serves an estate that wouldn’t look out of place in Tower Hamlets or Easterhouse. Yet inside, butterflies flit and the head gardener, Toni, turns sod like he is digging at Prince Charles’s Highgrove estate.<br/>A success then? "In terms of improving the diet of the population it has had a beneficial effect," says Wilkinson.<br/>"And it has been a success in terms of meeting some of the food security needs," he says, "but it has not resolved the problem since the island still imports a great deal of food."<br/>And change is on the horizon, which might be good for living standards, <br/>AND<br/>pesticide and fertiliser use mainly due to "financial constraints, not choice".</p><h4 id="HTurnsag-Wormsarekeytoourplanetarysurvival.Vermicompostingexpertiseislimited" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Turns ag - Worms are key to our planetary survival. &nbsp;Vermicomposting expertise is limited</span></h4><p>Blakemore 10 - Studied ’VermEcology’ for 30 years and holds qualifications in ecology, computing and permaculture. ~Dr. Rob Blakemore, "Wonder Worm to the rescue," Our World 2.0, July 2, 2010, pg. <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://ourworld.unu.edu/en/wonder-worm-to-the-rescue/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://ourworld.unu.edu/en/wonder-worm-to-the-rescue/%27" tppabs="http://ourworld.unu.edu/en/wonder-worm-to-the-rescue/"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://ourworld.unu.edu/en/wonder-worm-to-the-rescue/</span></a></span></p><p>Can worms help save the planet? I think so and, before arguing my case, please let me state my position from the start: I am an ecologist. Not just the type of trendy person who faithfully recycles — although I am fashionably green and a semi-vegetarian who tries to recycle as many beer bottles as possible. No, I am also the other, scientific kind. <br/>The science of ecology is generally defined as a study of organisms and their environment, i.e., everything21 However, I would be somewhat more categorical and say that it is "The study of organisms, their products whether alive or dead, and their environment" — i.e., even more of everything, including fossil fuels and human endeavour21<br/>An ecologist then, is someone who considers holistic workings of a natural ecosystem in all its complexity and diversity throughout its time-cycle while breaking it down into its component parts and honing in on its few key, controlling entities. Simultaneously practicing as a generalist and as a multi-faceted specialist. <br/>Deeds of the dirt<br/>The experience of growing up in rural England alongside my grandfather, the village farrier <br/>AND<br/>the living organisms, paramount amongst which is the humble, hidden earthworm.<br/>Here I must air my strong objections to marine biologists such as Sylvia Earle who pointed out after winning the TED 2009 Prize that the oceans make up 70 of the surface of the Earth and the rest is just "dirt".<br/>Approximately 99.4 of our food and fibre is produced on land and only 0.6 comes from oceans and other aquatic ecosystems combined, according to FAO. The calorific value obtained from ocean catches, freshwater fishing and aquaculture adds up to just about 10-16 of the current human total. (These figures are slightly skewed for maritime countries like Japan and Iceland but still, more than 80 of our nutrition is terrestrial in origin).<br/>Furthermore, I am sure Dr. Earle accepts that the oceanic ecosystem is wholly dependent upon dissolved nutrients washed down or blown from the soil and is similarly affected by pollution mainly from activity on the land. Her survival depends as much as anyone’s on the "just dirt" part.<br/>Thus it is abysmal that scientific knowledge of the oceans is infinitely deeper than for terrestrial ecosystems. Moreover, Leonardo da Vinci’s observed 500 years ago that "We know more about the movement of celestial bodies than about the soil underfoot" and this still rings true today. The journal Science, realizing that our knowledge is so scant, produced a special 2004 issue entitled Soils — The Final Frontier.<br/>Why waste precious funds and brain resources on the vain discovery of useless planets overhead or new deep-sea species that will still be there tomorrow, while vital unrecognized organisms literally beneath our feet disappear at an increasingly alarming rate and to our peril?<br/>Why are we not concentrating our efforts and valuable resources on protecting and preserving the tangible deeds of our earthly home patch for current and future generations of Earthlings? Where on earth is our Soil Ecology Institute?<br/>Global worming <br/>We talk of greenhouse gasses and global warming yet it is the lithosphere, not <br/>AND<br/>an Our World 2.0 article on this ’ red hot power’.)<br/>Proper management of our arable, pastoral and forest soils is the most practically feasible mechanism to sequester atmospheric carbon without any adverse effects. Atmospheric carbon is entirely recycled via the soil from plants in around 12-20 years — all of this being processed through the intestines of worms.<br/>Vermicomposting of organics and encouraging soil biodiversity by rebuilding humus provides a natural closed-system remedy with neither waste nor loss of productivity.<br/>Down-to-Earth soil species <br/>All manner of dirt and disease always ends up in the sod and consequentially its ecology is naturally robust. Yet, the soil suffers the most profound and significant effects from over-exploitation and faces the greatest threat from erosion, destruction and pollution with artificial chemicals and/or transgenes.<br/>Despite its importance, soil biodiversity is so poorly known that even obvious organisms like the relatively large worms are mostly unclassified. On each field trip I find new species and, of the 10,000 that have been given scientific names thus far (perhaps less than a third of the total), we know something of the ecology about a dozen species.<br/>But what we do know doesn’t look good. Unprecedented loss of species abundance and diversity combined with high extinction rates are bringing Earth into new and uncharted territory. We urgently need triage.<br/>Laboratories crammed with scores of ecologists could study just worms for their whole careers and still we would only progress slightly from our current poor state of knowledge, but our gain would be justifiable and have tangible effects on resolving pressing environmental issues. But this is not the current situation.<br/>Fundamentally we can justify study of soil ecology because it affects all our lives and <br/>AND<br/>healthy soil in which any healthy crop could develop in the first place.<br/>If we ask "Which group of organisms would cause the most disruption to life <br/>AND<br/>claim such importance for their study subject? <br/>Looking forward to the past<br/>One of the main predictions, highly optimistic, in the revolutionary move into our post-industrial era (see Alvin Toffler’s The Third Wave for details) was that genetic engineering would provide new production methods and have profound effects on future development. In many ways this has been borne out in medical use and microbial ’manufacture’ with genetically modified organisms (GMOs) that provide some potential benefit and serve some purpose, albeit at huge cost.<br/>But there are equally large risks. Rather obviously, the main characteristic of life is to reproduce and disperse. The architects of the modified corn, cotton, soy, wheat, rice and spuds are often of exactly the same companies (or at least profit-driven mind-sets) that produced the toxic chemicals that they are now telling us their new GMO technology will replace — just as chemical engineers promised solutions to all our problems previously.<br/>In 1962 Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring first alerted us to risks of agricultural chemical pollution, exacerbated by bioaccumulation in body tissue (especially of invertebrates such as earthworms) and bioconcentration further up the food-chain. But whatever the problem, these chemicals will eventually disperse and decline once production halts.<br/>With biology the reverse is true. Design a plant to be herbicide or insect resistant and it will increase and spread by its own means, by cross-pollination or genetic drift. Case in point is the illegitimate escape in Japan of feral oilseed rape ( Brassica napus) genetically modified to resist herbicide that, as with any similar calamity, will continue in an uncontrollable fashion.<br/>Rather than addressing immediate environmental issues per se, much of scientific resources are diverted into molecular studies, mostly for industrial agricultural production, that are inordinately expensive, or into agronomic trials of effective toxic biocide applications. Mostly this is not requested by informed consumers nor by farmers who must rely on the advice of often industry-funded ’experts’ and extension officers (hopefully not advertisers).<br/>Surprisingly and shamefully, almost zero funding is available for research on organic production ’alternatives’ that are dismissed as impractical fads. Yet it is their implementation, since the start of the agricultural revolution 10,000 years ago, that has brought us this far.<br/>Let’s not let topsoil slip through our fingers <br/>Topsoil is the most valuable resource upon which civilizations depend. Its rapid loss combined with soil fertility and soil health decline are of greatest immediate concern.<br/>How important is loss of topsoil? Basically without fertile topsoil there is no plant <br/>AND<br/>seriously degraded, according to the UN’S 2005 Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA).<br/>Loss of topsoil has been due to the combined effects of desertification, salinization, <br/>AND<br/>degraded, and Asia, where 11 is now unsuitable for farming.<br/>In addition to those pollutants commonly recognized as originating from biocides and fertilizers, there are many other sources — such as antibiotics associated with intensive animal production, plus a ’cocktail’ of human-processed pollutants like drugs, solvents and synthetic hormones from birth control pills — that all make their way into the environment in an infinite variety of unforeseeable combinations.<br/>Suggested remediation to soil decline and agricultural production are to use GMO crops and other high-tech applications, because there is an assumption that topsoil formation is a centuries-old process that is essentially non-renewable and thus is gone forever. This view is false and there are several examples of methods that can be applied to restore fertile topsoils to farms, and in a time frame as short as a matter of a few years.<br/>Feed the worm <br/>"When the question is asked, ’Can I build top-soil?’ the answer is ’Yes’, and when the first question is followed by a second question, ’How?’ the answer is ’Feed earthworms’," so wrote Eve Balfour in the introduction to Thomas J. Barrett’s book, Harnessing the Earthworm.<br/>Indeed there are many instances of organic farms around the world preserving or restoring healthy <br/>AND<br/>well known and widely adopted by national and local communities and individuals worldwide.<br/>William Blake urged us "~t~o see a world in a grain of sand and a heaven in a wildflower". Soil survey of &nbsp;the abundance and diversity of earthworms in a soil will provide a good measure of natural fertility, as these are the monitors and mediators of soil health. &nbsp;That some of our honourable predecessors appreciated the worm’s role is manifest by one translation of the Chinese characters for ’earthworms’ being ’angels of the earth’.<br/>Seeing a worm turned up by the plough and eaten by a bird started Prince Siddhartha (Gautama Buddah) on his contemplative path to understanding the Cycle-of-Life. In the Classical world, the ’father of biology’, Aristotle, called earthworms the "soil’s entrails" and it is reported that Cleopatra decreed them sacred.<br/>Charles Darwin, British naturalist and father of evolution, also had an interest in <br/>AND<br/>of earthworms on soils and plant growth, and thus on human survival.<br/>Believing his worm work one of his most crucial contributions, Darwin <br/>stated:<br/>"It may be doubted whether there are many other animals which have played so important a part in the history of the world, as have these lowly organized creatures…<br/>"The vegetable mould ~humus~ which covers, as with a mantle, the surface of the land, has all passed many times through their bodies."<br/>Hopefully it will continue thus.<br/>In 1981, as a centennial tribute to Darwin’s seminal work, I completed a <br/>AND<br/>cost savings in chemicals and environmental degradation. (Details are presented here.)<br/>Look up to the worm <br/>My thesis is that each of the three major interlinked influences on our world – <br/>AND<br/>-process organic ’wastes’ via worms, for a natural compost fertilizer.</p></div></div></td><td>12/19/13</td></tr><tr><td style="width:100%; word-break:break-all; word-break:break-word;"><div><p><input onclick="saveEntry(8)" src="../../xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" tppabs="http://hspolicy13.debatecoaches.org/xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" style="float:right;" title="Save" type="image" value="Save"></input>

In that agreement, Tehran agreed to limit uranium enrichment in return for an easing of international sanctions.<br/>The administration’s push to hold off on sanctions gained further momentum when other senators - including senior Republicans - said they did not expect action now.<br/>"I realized we’re sort of going through a rope-a-dope here in the Senate and that we’re not actually going to do anything," said Senator Bob Corker, the top Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee and a member of the Banking panel.<br/>Underscoring the administration’s insistence that it is not backing down on Iran, the U.S. Treasury Department announced shortly before the Banking Committee hearing that it had blacklisted several companies and individuals for supporting Iran’s nuclear program.<br/>TALKS CONTINUE<br/>The P5+1 powers who negotiated the interim deal on Iran’s nuclear program - Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States - are continuing negotiations with a goal of reaching a comprehensive final deal in six months.<br/>Johnson also said he and Senator Mike Crapo, the top Republican on the Banking panel, had crafted a new sanctions bill, not to pass now, but to be put into effect if Iran does not comply with the Geneva agreement or negotiations collapse.<br/>"I am holding back ... simply because of the administration’s request," Crapo told reporters after the hearing.<br/>Crapo said he believed in strong sanctions but had not decided how he would vote if a group of more hawkish senators led by Democrat Robert Menendez and Republican Mark Kirk pursued a plan to introduce sanctions legislation without going through the Banking Committee.<br/>Menendez said at the banking hearing that he remained deeply skeptical about Iran and said the Senate might need to pass a resolution spelling out what it sees as terms of an acceptable final agreement with Iran.<br/>The Obama administration is eager to remind companies hoping for an opening to do business with Iran that sanctions that have crippled the country’s economy remain in place.<br/>"We are very actively dissuading international oil companies and others who think that now may be a time to test the waters in Iran," David Cohen, undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence for the Treasury Department, said at the hearing.</p><h4 id="HPlancostscapital-1" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Plan costs capital</span></h4><p>Aho 13 (Matthew Aho, Inter-American Dialogue’s Latin America Advisor, What Does Obama’s Second Term Hold for U.S.-Cuba Relations?, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.cubastudygroup.org/index.cfm/newsroom?ContentRecord_id=2c202b27-1916-4509-b1b7-00d7ed8f4914-http://www.cubastudygroup.org/index.cfm/newsroom?ContentRecord_id=2c202b27-1916-4509-b1b7-00d7ed8f4914  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path excluded from retrieval by the project\%27s Exclusions properties.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.cubastudygroup.org/index.cfm/newsroom?ContentRecord_id=2c202b27-1916-4509-b1b7-00d7ed8f4914-http://www.cubastudygroup.org/index.cfm/newsroom?ContentRecord_id=2c202b27-1916-4509-b1b7-00d7ed8f4914%27" tppabs="http://www.cubastudygroup.org/index.cfm/newsroom?ContentRecord_id=2c202b27-1916-4509-b1b7-00d7ed8f4914-http://www.cubastudygroup.org/index.cfm/newsroom?ContentRecord_id=2c202b27-1916-4509-b1b7-00d7ed8f4914"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.cubastudygroup.org/index.cfm/newsroom?ContentRecord_id=2c202b27-1916-4509-b1b7-00d7ed8f4914-http://www.cubastudygroup.org/index.cfm/newsroom?ContentRecord_id=2c202b27-1916-4509-b1b7-00d7ed8f4914</span></a></span>, 1/23/13)</p><p>Aside from easing some travel restrictions, there have been only two emergent themes on <br/>AND<br/>furthering goals laid out during his first.

Raúl Castro represent a genuine political opening toward greater freedom.<br/>If anything, things are getting worse. The report, which covers 2012, says the independent Cuban Commission on Human Rights and Reconciliation counted 6,602 short-term detentions during the year, compared with 4,123 in 2011. In March 2012, the same commission recorded a 30-year record high of 1,158 short-term detentions in a single month just before the visit of Pope Benedict XVI.<br/>Among the many abuses cited by the 2012 report are the prison sentences handed out to members of the Unión Patriotica de Cuba, the estimated 3,000 citizens held under the charge of "potential dangerousness," state-orchestrated assaults against the Damas de Blanco (Ladies in White), the suspicious death of dissident Oswaldo Payá and so on.<br/>As in any dictatorship, telling the truth is a crime: Independent journalist Calixto Ramón Martínez Arias, the first to report on the cholera outbreak in Cuba, was jailed in September for the crime of desacato (insulting speech) and remained there until last week.<br/>The regime is willing to undertake some meek economic reforms to keep people employed. It has even dared to relax its travel requirements to allow more Cubans to leave the country if they can get a passport.<br/>Both of these are short-term survival measures, designed as escape valves for growing internal pressure. But when it comes to free speech, political activity and freedom of association — the building blocks of a free society — the report is a depressing chronicle of human-rights abuses and a valuable reminder that repression is the Castro regime’s only response to those who demand a genuinely free Cuba. Fundamental reform?

If we both want the <br/>AND<br/>rage. Thus ethics identifies the rights of individuals when their interests conflict.<br/>But how can a case for shunning be made on this view of morality? <br/>AND<br/>, on what grounds might it be a duty to impose such sanctions?<br/>We find the answer when we note that there is another "level" of <br/>AND<br/>rights of others with one’s actions but also to support that moral order.<br/>Consider that the moral order itself contributes significantly to people’s rights being respected. It <br/>AND<br/>it indirectly affects people’s rights. And this is where shunning fits in.<br/>Certain types of behavior constitute a direct attack on the moral order. When the <br/>AND<br/>three conditions which turn immoral behavior into an attack on the moral order.<br/>An immoral action is flagrant if it is "extremely or deliberately conspicuous; notorious<br/>AND<br/>reaffirms the legitimacy of that moral order. How does shunning do this?<br/>First, by refusing publicly to have to do with such a person one announces support for the moral order and backs up the announcement with action. This action reinforces the commitment to the moral order both of the shunner and of the other members of the community. (Secretary of State Shultz in effect made this argument in his call for international sanctions on Libya in the early days of 1986.)<br/>Further, shunning may have a moral effect on the shunned person, even if the direct impact is not adequate to change the immoral behavior. If the shunned person thinks of herself as part of the moral community, shunning may well make clear to her that she is, in fact, removing herself from that community by the behavior in question. Thus shunning may achieve by moral suasion what cannot be achieved by "force."<br/>Finally, shunning may be a form of punishment, of moral sanction, whose appropriateness depends not on whether it will change the person’s behavior, but on whether he deserves the punishment for violating the moral order. Punishment then can be viewed as a way of maintaining the moral order, of "purifying the community" after it has been made "unclean," as ancient communities might have put it.<br/>Yet not every immoral action requires that we shun. As noted above, we <br/>AND<br/>on the moral order itself through flagrant, willful, and persistent wrongdoing. <br/>We can also now see why failure to shun can under certain circumstances suggest complicity. But it is not that we have a duty to shun because failure to do so suggests complicity. Rather, because we have an obligation to shun in certain circumstances, when we fail to do so others may interpret our failure as tacit complicity in the willful, persistent, and flagrant immorality.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h1 id="H5-2" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>5</span></h1><h4 id="HText:TheUnitedStatesfederalgovernmentsubstantiallyeaseitseconomicrestrictionsontheRepublicofCuba.ifandonlyiftheRepublicofCubaagreestocombathumanrightsabuses-1" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Text: The &nbsp;United States federal government substantially ease its economic restrictions on the Republic of Cuba. if and only if the Republic of Cuba agrees to combat human rights abuses</span></h4><h4 id="HWeshouldcontinuetodemandsignificantreformsbeforerelaxingU.S.policy-2" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>We should continue to demand significant reforms before relaxing U.S. policy</span></h4><p>José R. <strong>Cárdenas</strong>, Nov. 13, <strong>’12</strong>, an associate with the consulting firm <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://hspolicy13.debatecoaches.org/bin/Sioux+Falls+Roosevelt/VisionAmericas-http://www.visionamericas.com/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path excluded from retrieval by the project\%27s Exclusions properties.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://hspolicy13.debatecoaches.org/bin/Sioux+Falls+Roosevelt/VisionAmericas-http://www.visionamericas.com/%27" tppabs="http://hspolicy13.debatecoaches.org/bin/Sioux+Falls+Roosevelt/VisionAmericas-http://www.visionamericas.com/"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">VisionAmericas-http://www.visionamericas.com/</span></a></span>, former Acting Assistant Administrator for Latin America and the Caribbean and Senior Advisor at the Organization of American States and as a senior professional staff member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, "Cuba policy in a second Obama <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://hspolicy13.debatecoaches.org/bin/Sioux+Falls+Roosevelt/term-http://shadow.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/11/13/cuba_policy_in_a_second_obama_term  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path excluded from retrieval by the project\%27s Exclusions properties.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://hspolicy13.debatecoaches.org/bin/Sioux+Falls+Roosevelt/term-http://shadow.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/11/13/cuba_policy_in_a_second_obama_term%27" tppabs="http://hspolicy13.debatecoaches.org/bin/Sioux+Falls+Roosevelt/term-http://shadow.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/11/13/cuba_policy_in_a_second_obama_term"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">term-http://shadow.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/11/13/cuba_policy_in_a_second_obama_term</span></a></span>," Foreign Policy, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://shadow.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/11/13/cuba_policy_in_a_second_obama_term-http://shadow.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/11/13/cuba_policy_in_a_second_obama_term  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path excluded from retrieval by the project\%27s Exclusions properties.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://shadow.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/11/13/cuba_policy_in_a_second_obama_term-http://shadow.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/11/13/cuba_policy_in_a_second_obama_term%27" tppabs="http://shadow.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/11/13/cuba_policy_in_a_second_obama_term-http://shadow.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/11/13/cuba_policy_in_a_second_obama_term"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://shadow.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/11/13/cuba_policy_in_a_second_obama_term-http://shadow.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/11/13/cuba_policy_in_a_second_obama_term</span></a></span>, ACC. 6-1-2013, JT<em>JEDI<br/>Secondly, critics have convinced themselves that if it weren’t for the Cuban American lobby, the U.S. would have long ago reached an accommodation with the Castro dictatorship.

At the same time, Congress refused to pass food-stamp legislation this summer, pushing it off again and threatening draconian cuts.<br/>The country will crash into the debt ceiling in mid-October, which would be an economic disaster, especially with a government shutdown looming at the same time. These are deadlines that Congress already learned two years ago not to toy with, but memories appear to be preciously short.<br/>The Federal Reserve needs a new chief in three months, someone who will help <br/>AND<br/>to some – with a Congress already unwilling to do the President’s bidding.<br/>Congress was supposed to pass a farm bill this summer, but declined to do so even though the task is already two years late. As a result, the country has no farm bill, leaving agricultural subsidies up in the air, farmers uncertain about what their financial picture looks like, and a potential food crisis on the horizon.<br/>The two main housing agencies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, have been in limbo for four years and are desperately in need of reform that should start this fall, but there is scant attention to the problem.<br/>These are the problems going unattended by the Obama administration while his aides and cabinet members have been wasting the nation’s time making the rounds on television and Capitol Hill stumping for a profoundly unpopular war. The fact that all this chest-beating was for naught, and an easy solution seems on the horizon, belies the single-minded intensity that the Obama White House brought to its insistence on bombing Syria.<br/>More than one wag has suggested, with the utmost reason, that if Obama had brought this kind of passion to domestic initiatives, the country would be in better condition right now. As it is, public policy is embarrassingly in shambles at home while the administration throws all of its resources and political capital behind a widely hated plan to get involved in a civil war overseas.<br/>The upshot for the president may be that it’s easier to wage war with a foreign power than go head-to-head with the US Congress, even as America suffers from neglect.<br/>This is the paradox that President Obama is facing this fall, as he appears to turn his back on a number of crucial and urgent domestic initiatives in order to spend all of his meager political capital on striking Syria.<br/>Syria does present a significant humanitarian crisis, which has been true for the past two years that the Obama administration has completely ignored the atrocities of Bashar al-Assad.<br/>Two years is also roughly the same amount of time that key domestic initiatives have also gone ignored as Obama and Congress engage in petty battles for dominance and leave the country to run itself on a starvation diet imposed by sequestration cuts. Leon Panetta tells the story of how he tried to lobby against sequestration only to be told:<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leon, you don’t understand. The Congress is resigned to failure.<br/>Similarly, those on Wall Street, the Federal Reserve, those working at government agencies, and voters themselves have become all too practiced at ignoring the determined incompetence of those in Washington.<br/>Political capital – the ability to horse-trade and win political favors from a <br/>AND<br/>on the domestic tasks it wants to accomplish, one at a time.<br/>The president is scheduled to speak six times this week, mostly about Syria. That includes evening news interviews, an address to the nation, and numerous other speeches. Behind the scenes, he is calling members of Congress to get them to fall into line. Secretary of State John Kerry is omnipresent, so ubiquitous on TV that it may be easier just to get him his own talk show called Syria Today.<br/>It would be a treat to see White House aides lobbying as aggressively – and on as many talk shows – for a better food stamp bill, an end to the debt-ceiling drama, or a solution to the senseless sequestration cuts, as it is on what is clearly a useless boondoggle in Syria.<br/>There’s no reason to believe that Congress can have an all-consuming debate about Syria and then, somehow refreshed, return to a domestic agenda that has been as chaotic and urgent as any in recent memory. The President should have judged his options better. As it is, he should now judge his actions better.</p><h4 id="HFailuretoraisethedebtceilingensurescollapseoftheglobaleconomy2CU.S.economicleadership2Candfreetrade" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Failure to raise the debt ceiling ensures collapse of the global economy, U.S. economic leadership, and free trade</span></h4><p><strong>Davidson 9/10&nbsp;</strong><br/>Adam, columnist for the NYT magazine, co-founder of NPR’s "Planet Money,", former economics correspondent for NPR<br/><span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/15/magazine/our-debt-to-society.html?pagewanted=all26_r=0  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/15/magazine/our-debt-to-society.html?pagewanted=all26_r=0%27" tppabs="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/15/magazine/our-debt-to-society.html?pagewanted=all26_r=0"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/15/magazine/our-debt-to-society.html?pagewanted=all26_r=0</span></a></span>, MCR</p><p>If the debt ceiling isn’t lifted again this fall, some serious financial decisions will <br/>AND<br/>free asset more risky, the entire global economy becomes riskier and costlier.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HExtinction" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Extinction</span></h4><p><strong>Auslin 09</strong> (Michael, resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, 2009, "Averting Disaster Preventing the worst case scenario in Asia", 2-5, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/016/115jtnqw.asp?page=2)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/016/115jtnqw.asp?page=2)%27" tppabs="http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/016/115jtnqw.asp?page=2)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/016/115jtnqw.asp?page=2)</span></a></span><br/>AS THEY DEAL WITH a collapsing world economy, policymakers in Washington and around the <br/>AND<br/>types of miscalculation and greed that have destroyed international systems in the past.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h1 id="H3-3" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>3</span></h1><h4 id="H1.Thediscourseofcompetitivenessshiftseconomicdebatesintonationalisticdecisionsoverwhodeservestoliveandwhomustdie.-3" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>1.

If we both want the <br/>AND<br/>rage. Thus ethics identifies the rights of individuals when their interests conflict.<br/>But how can a case for shunning be made on this view of morality? <br/>AND<br/>, on what grounds might it be a duty to impose such sanctions?<br/>We find the answer when we note that there is another "level" of <br/>AND<br/>rights of others with one’s actions but also to support that moral order.<br/>Consider that the moral order itself contributes significantly to people’s rights being respected. It <br/>AND<br/>it indirectly affects people’s rights. And this is where shunning fits in.<br/>Certain types of behavior constitute a direct attack on the moral order. When the <br/>AND<br/>three conditions which turn immoral behavior into an attack on the moral order.<br/>An immoral action is flagrant if it is "extremely or deliberately conspicuous; notorious<br/>AND<br/>reaffirms the legitimacy of that moral order. How does shunning do this?<br/>First, by refusing publicly to have to do with such a person one announces support for the moral order and backs up the announcement with action. This action reinforces the commitment to the moral order both of the shunner and of the other members of the community. (Secretary of State Shultz in effect made this argument in his call for international sanctions on Libya in the early days of 1986.)<br/>Further, shunning may have a moral effect on the shunned person, even if the direct impact is not adequate to change the immoral behavior. If the shunned person thinks of herself as part of the moral community, shunning may well make clear to her that she is, in fact, removing herself from that community by the behavior in question. Thus shunning may achieve by moral suasion what cannot be achieved by "force."<br/>Finally, shunning may be a form of punishment, of moral sanction, whose appropriateness depends not on whether it will change the person’s behavior, but on whether he deserves the punishment for violating the moral order. Punishment then can be viewed as a way of maintaining the moral order, of "purifying the community" after it has been made "unclean," as ancient communities might have put it.<br/>Yet not every immoral action requires that we shun. As noted above, we <br/>AND<br/>on the moral order itself through flagrant, willful, and persistent wrongdoing. <br/>We can also now see why failure to shun can under certain circumstances suggest complicity. But it is not that we have a duty to shun because failure to do so suggests complicity.

Raúl Castro represent a genuine political opening toward greater freedom.<br/>If anything, things are getting worse. The report, which covers 2012, says the independent Cuban Commission on Human Rights and Reconciliation counted 6,602 short-term detentions during the year, compared with 4,123 in 2011. In March 2012, the same commission recorded a 30-year record high of 1,158 short-term detentions in a single month just before the visit of Pope Benedict XVI.<br/>Among the many abuses cited by the 2012 report are the prison sentences handed out to members of the Unión Patriotica de Cuba, the estimated 3,000 citizens held under the charge of "potential dangerousness," state-orchestrated assaults against the Damas de Blanco (Ladies in White), the suspicious death of dissident Oswaldo Payá and so on.<br/>As in any dictatorship, telling the truth is a crime: Independent journalist Calixto Ramón Martínez Arias, the first to report on the cholera outbreak in Cuba, was jailed in September for the crime of desacato (insulting speech) and remained there until last week.<br/>The regime is willing to undertake some meek economic reforms to keep people employed. It has even dared to relax its travel requirements to allow more Cubans to leave the country if they can get a passport.<br/>Both of these are short-term survival measures, designed as escape valves for growing internal pressure. But when it comes to free speech, political activity and freedom of association — the building blocks of a free society — the report is a depressing chronicle of human-rights abuses and a valuable reminder that repression is the Castro regime’s only response to those who demand a genuinely free Cuba.

Beversluis, Professor of Philosophy and Economics at Aquinas College, holds an A.B. in Philosophy and German from Calvin College, an M.A. in Philosophy from Northwestern University, an M.A. in Economics from Ohio State University, and a Ph.D. in the Philosophy of Education from Northwestern University, 1989 ("On Shunning Undesirable Regimes: Ethics and Economic Sanctions," Public Affairs Quarterly, Volume 3, Number 2, April, Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via JSTOR, p. 17-19)<br/>A fundamental task of morality is resolving conflicting interests. If we both want the <br/>AND<br/>rage. Thus ethics identifies the rights of individuals when their interests conflict.<br/>But how can a case for shunning be made on this view of morality? <br/>AND<br/>, on what grounds might it be a duty to impose such sanctions?<br/>We find the answer when we note that there is another "level" of <br/>AND<br/>rights of others with one’s actions but also to support that moral order.<br/>Consider that the moral order itself contributes significantly to people’s rights being respected. It <br/>AND<br/>it indirectly affects people’s rights. And this is where shunning fits in.<br/>Certain types of behavior constitute a direct attack on the moral order. When the <br/>AND<br/>three conditions which turn immoral behavior into an attack on the moral order.<br/>An immoral action is flagrant if it is "extremely or deliberately conspicuous; notorious<br/>AND<br/>reaffirms the legitimacy of that moral order. How does shunning do this?<br/>First, by refusing publicly to have to do with such a person one announces support for the moral order and backs up the announcement with action. This action reinforces the commitment to the moral order both of the shunner and of the other members of the community. (Secretary of State Shultz in effect made this argument in his call for international sanctions on Libya in the early days of 1986.)<br/>Further, shunning may have a moral effect on the shunned person, even if the direct impact is not adequate to change the immoral behavior. If the shunned person thinks of herself as part of the moral community, shunning may well make clear to her that she is, in fact, removing herself from that community by the behavior in question. Thus shunning may achieve by moral suasion what cannot be achieved by "force."<br/>Finally, shunning may be a form of punishment, of moral sanction, whose appropriateness depends not on whether it will change the person’s behavior, but on whether he deserves the punishment for violating the moral order. Punishment then can be viewed as a way of maintaining the moral order, of "purifying the community" after it has been made "unclean," as ancient communities might have put it.<br/>Yet not every immoral action requires that we shun. As noted above, we <br/>AND<br/>on the moral order itself through flagrant, willful, and persistent wrongdoing. <br/>We can also now see why failure to shun can under certain circumstances suggest complicity. But it is not that we have a duty to shun because failure to do so suggests complicity. Rather, because we have an obligation to shun in certain circumstances, when we fail to do so others may interpret our failure as tacit complicity in the willful, persistent, and flagrant immorality.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h1 id="H4-4" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>4</span></h1><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HText:TheUnitedStatesExecutiveBranchshouldpursuetradeliberalizationwithCubaforagriculturecommoditiesifandonlyiftheRepublicofCubaagreestocombathumanrightsabuses" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Text: The United States Executive Branch should pursue trade liberalization with Cuba for agriculture commodities if and only if the Republic of Cuba agrees to combat human rights abuses</span></h4><h4 id="HWeshouldcontinuetodemandsignificantreformsbeforerelaxingU.S.policy-3" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>We should continue to demand significant reforms before relaxing U.S. policy</span></h4><p>José R. <strong>Cárdenas</strong>, Nov. 13, <strong>’12</strong>, an associate with the consulting firm VisionAmericas, former Acting Assistant Administrator for Latin America and the Caribbean and Senior Advisor at the Organization of American States and as a senior professional staff member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, "Cuba policy in a second Obama term," Foreign Policy, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://shadow.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/11/13/cuba_policy_in_a_second_obama_term  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://shadow.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/11/13/cuba_policy_in_a_second_obama_term%27" tppabs="http://shadow.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/11/13/cuba_policy_in_a_second_obama_term"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://shadow.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/11/13/cuba_policy_in_a_second_obama_term</span></a></span>, ACC. 6-1-2013, JT<em>JEDI<br/>Secondly, critics have convinced themselves that if it weren’t for the Cuban American lobby, the U.S. would have long ago reached an accommodation with the Castro dictatorship.

"Cuba had to produce twice as much food, with less than half the chemical inputs," according to the COSG. Land was switched from export crops to food production, and tractors were switched for oxen. People were encouraged to move from the city to the land and organic farming methods were introduced. <br/>"Integrated pest management, crop rotation, composting and soil conservation were implemented," says the COSG. The country had to become expert in techniques like worm composting and biopesticides. "Worms and worm farm technology is now a Cuban export," says Dr Stephen Wilkinson, assistant director of the International Institute for the Study of Cuba.<br/>Thus, the unique system of organoponicos, or urban organic farming, was started<br/>AND<br/>says, food intake is back at 2,600 calories a day.<br/>Organoponico plaza<br/>A visit to Havana’s largest organoponico, the three-hectare Organoponico Plaza, which lies a stone’s throw from the city’s Plaza de la Revolución and the desk of Raul Castro, confirms that the scheme is doing well. Rows of strikingly neat irrigated raised beds are home to seasonal crops of lettuces, spring onions, chives, garlic and parsley. <br/>Guava and noni fruit trees provide shade around the perimeter, while on the far side compost piles sit next to plastic tunnels used to raise seedlings. Outside in the shop, signs extol the virtues of eating your greens. <br/>The shop is open only on Mondays. Produce is sold by the people who work the garden (they keep 50 of sales, so are motivated to produce a lot) to the people who live nearby. In this case, the organoponico serves an estate that wouldn’t look out of place in Tower Hamlets or Easterhouse. Yet inside, butterflies flit and the head gardener, Toni, turns sod like he is digging at Prince Charles’s Highgrove estate.<br/>A success then? "In terms of improving the diet of the population it has had a beneficial effect," says Wilkinson.<br/>"And it has been a success in terms of meeting some of the food security needs," he says, "but it has not resolved the problem since the island still imports a great deal of food."<br/>And change is on the horizon, which might be good for living standards, <br/>AND<br/>pesticide and fertiliser use mainly due to "financial constraints, not choice".</p><h4 id="HTurnsag-Wormsarekeytoourplanetarysurvival.Vermicompostingexpertiseislimited-1" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Turns ag - Worms are key to our planetary survival. &nbsp;Vermicomposting expertise is limited</span></h4><p>Blakemore 10 - Studied ’VermEcology’ for 30 years and holds qualifications in ecology, computing and permaculture. ~Dr. Rob Blakemore, "Wonder Worm to the rescue," Our World 2.0, July 2, 2010, pg. <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://ourworld.unu.edu/en/wonder-worm-to-the-rescue/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://ourworld.unu.edu/en/wonder-worm-to-the-rescue/%27" tppabs="http://ourworld.unu.edu/en/wonder-worm-to-the-rescue/"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://ourworld.unu.edu/en/wonder-worm-to-the-rescue/</span></a></span></p><p>Can worms help save the planet? I think so and, before arguing my case, please let me state my position from the start: I am an ecologist. Not just the type of trendy person who faithfully recycles — although I am fashionably green and a semi-vegetarian who tries to recycle as many beer bottles as possible. No, I am also the other, scientific kind. <br/>The science of ecology is generally defined as a study of organisms and their environment, i.e., everything21 However, I would be somewhat more categorical and say that it is "The study of organisms, their products whether alive or dead, and their environment" — i.e., even more of everything, including fossil fuels and human endeavour21<br/>An ecologist then, is someone who considers holistic workings of a natural ecosystem in all its complexity and diversity throughout its time-cycle while breaking it down into its component parts and honing in on its few key, controlling entities. Simultaneously practicing as a generalist and as a multi-faceted specialist. <br/>Deeds of the dirt<br/>The experience of growing up in rural England alongside my grandfather, the village farrier <br/>AND<br/>the living organisms, paramount amongst which is the humble, hidden earthworm.<br/>Here I must air my strong objections to marine biologists such as Sylvia Earle who pointed out after winning the TED 2009 Prize that the oceans make up 70 of the surface of the Earth and the rest is just "dirt".<br/>Approximately 99.4 of our food and fibre is produced on land and only 0.6 comes from oceans and other aquatic ecosystems combined, according to FAO. The calorific value obtained from ocean catches, freshwater fishing and aquaculture adds up to just about 10-16 of the current human total. (These figures are slightly skewed for maritime countries like Japan and Iceland but still, more than 80 of our nutrition is terrestrial in origin).<br/>Furthermore, I am sure Dr. Earle accepts that the oceanic ecosystem is wholly dependent upon dissolved nutrients washed down or blown from the soil and is similarly affected by pollution mainly from activity on the land. Her survival depends as much as anyone’s on the "just dirt" part.<br/>Thus it is abysmal that scientific knowledge of the oceans is infinitely deeper than for terrestrial ecosystems. Moreover, Leonardo da Vinci’s observed 500 years ago that "We know more about the movement of celestial bodies than about the soil underfoot" and this still rings true today. The journal Science, realizing that our knowledge is so scant, produced a special 2004 issue entitled Soils — The Final Frontier.<br/>Why waste precious funds and brain resources on the vain discovery of useless planets overhead or new deep-sea species that will still be there tomorrow, while vital unrecognized organisms literally beneath our feet disappear at an increasingly alarming rate and to our peril?<br/>Why are we not concentrating our efforts and valuable resources on protecting and preserving the tangible deeds of our earthly home patch for current and future generations of Earthlings? Where on earth is our Soil Ecology Institute?<br/>Global worming <br/>We talk of greenhouse gasses and global warming yet it is the lithosphere, not <br/>AND<br/>an Our World 2.0 article on this ’ red hot power’.)<br/>Proper management of our arable, pastoral and forest soils is the most practically feasible mechanism to sequester atmospheric carbon without any adverse effects. Atmospheric carbon is entirely recycled via the soil from plants in around 12-20 years — all of this being processed through the intestines of worms.<br/>Vermicomposting of organics and encouraging soil biodiversity by rebuilding humus provides a natural closed-system remedy with neither waste nor loss of productivity.<br/>Down-to-Earth soil species <br/>All manner of dirt and disease always ends up in the sod and consequentially its ecology is naturally robust. Yet, the soil suffers the most profound and significant effects from over-exploitation and faces the greatest threat from erosion, destruction and pollution with artificial chemicals and/or transgenes.<br/>Despite its importance, soil biodiversity is so poorly known that even obvious organisms like the relatively large worms are mostly unclassified. On each field trip I find new species and, of the 10,000 that have been given scientific names thus far (perhaps less than a third of the total), we know something of the ecology about a dozen species.<br/>But what we do know doesn’t look good. Unprecedented loss of species abundance and diversity combined with high extinction rates are bringing Earth into new and uncharted territory. We urgently need triage.<br/>Laboratories crammed with scores of ecologists could study just worms for their whole careers and still we would only progress slightly from our current poor state of knowledge, but our gain would be justifiable and have tangible effects on resolving pressing environmental issues. But this is not the current situation.<br/>Fundamentally we can justify study of soil ecology because it affects all our lives and <br/>AND<br/>healthy soil in which any healthy crop could develop in the first place.<br/>If we ask "Which group of organisms would cause the most disruption to life <br/>AND<br/>claim such importance for their study subject? <br/>Looking forward to the past<br/>One of the main predictions, highly optimistic, in the revolutionary move into our post-industrial era (see Alvin Toffler’s The Third Wave for details) was that genetic engineering would provide new production methods and have profound effects on future development. In many ways this has been borne out in medical use and microbial ’manufacture’ with genetically modified organisms (GMOs) that provide some potential benefit and serve some purpose, albeit at huge cost.<br/>But there are equally large risks. Rather obviously, the main characteristic of life is to reproduce and disperse. The architects of the modified corn, cotton, soy, wheat, rice and spuds are often of exactly the same companies (or at least profit-driven mind-sets) that produced the toxic chemicals that they are now telling us their new GMO technology will replace — just as chemical engineers promised solutions to all our problems previously.<br/>In 1962 Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring first alerted us to risks of agricultural chemical pollution, exacerbated by bioaccumulation in body tissue (especially of invertebrates such as earthworms) and bioconcentration further up the food-chain. But whatever the problem, these chemicals will eventually disperse and decline once production halts.<br/>With biology the reverse is true. Design a plant to be herbicide or insect resistant and it will increase and spread by its own means, by cross-pollination or genetic drift. Case in point is the illegitimate escape in Japan of feral oilseed rape ( Brassica napus) genetically modified to resist herbicide that, as with any similar calamity, will continue in an uncontrollable fashion.<br/>Rather than addressing immediate environmental issues per se, much of scientific resources are diverted into molecular studies, mostly for industrial agricultural production, that are inordinately expensive, or into agronomic trials of effective toxic biocide applications. Mostly this is not requested by informed consumers nor by farmers who must rely on the advice of often industry-funded ’experts’ and extension officers (hopefully not advertisers).<br/>Surprisingly and shamefully, almost zero funding is available for research on organic production ’alternatives’ that are dismissed as impractical fads. Yet it is their implementation, since the start of the agricultural revolution 10,000 years ago, that has brought us this far.<br/>Let’s not let topsoil slip through our fingers <br/>Topsoil is the most valuable resource upon which civilizations depend. Its rapid loss combined with soil fertility and soil health decline are of greatest immediate concern.<br/>How important is loss of topsoil? Basically without fertile topsoil there is no plant <br/>AND<br/>seriously degraded, according to the UN’S 2005 Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA).<br/>Loss of topsoil has been due to the combined effects of desertification, salinization, <br/>AND<br/>degraded, and Asia, where 11 is now unsuitable for farming.<br/>In addition to those pollutants commonly recognized as originating from biocides and fertilizers, there are many other sources — such as antibiotics associated with intensive animal production, plus a ’cocktail’ of human-processed pollutants like drugs, solvents and synthetic hormones from birth control pills — that all make their way into the environment in an infinite variety of unforeseeable combinations.<br/>Suggested remediation to soil decline and agricultural production are to use GMO crops and other high-tech applications, because there is an assumption that topsoil formation is a centuries-old process that is essentially non-renewable and thus is gone forever. This view is false and there are several examples of methods that can be applied to restore fertile topsoils to farms, and in a time frame as short as a matter of a few years.<br/>Feed the worm <br/>"When the question is asked, ’Can I build top-soil?’ the answer is ’Yes’, and when the first question is followed by a second question, ’How?’ the answer is ’Feed earthworms’," so wrote Eve Balfour in the introduction to Thomas J. Barrett’s book, Harnessing the Earthworm.<br/>Indeed there are many instances of organic farms around the world preserving or restoring healthy <br/>AND<br/>well known and widely adopted by national and local communities and individuals worldwide.<br/>William Blake urged us "~t~o see a world in a grain of sand and a heaven in a wildflower". Soil survey of &nbsp;the abundance and diversity of earthworms in a soil will provide a good measure of natural fertility, as these are the monitors and mediators of soil health. &nbsp;That some of our honourable predecessors appreciated the worm’s role is manifest by one translation of the Chinese characters for ’earthworms’ being ’angels of the earth’.<br/>Seeing a worm turned up by the plough and eaten by a bird started Prince Siddhartha (Gautama Buddah) on his contemplative path to understanding the Cycle-of-Life. In the Classical world, the ’father of biology’, Aristotle, called earthworms the "soil’s entrails" and it is reported that Cleopatra decreed them sacred.<br/>Charles Darwin, British naturalist and father of evolution, also had an interest in <br/>AND<br/>of earthworms on soils and plant growth, and thus on human survival.<br/>Believing his worm work one of his most crucial contributions, Darwin <br/>stated:<br/>"It may be doubted whether there are many other animals which have played so important a part in the history of the world, as have these lowly organized creatures…<br/>"The vegetable mould ~humus~ which covers, as with a mantle, the surface of the land, has all passed many times through their bodies."<br/>Hopefully it will continue thus.<br/>In 1981, as a centennial tribute to Darwin’s seminal work, I completed a <br/>AND<br/>cost savings in chemicals and environmental degradation.

Raúl Castro represent a genuine political opening toward greater freedom.<br/>If anything, things are getting worse. The report, which covers 2012, says the independent Cuban Commission on Human Rights and Reconciliation counted 6,602 short-term detentions during the year, compared with 4,123 in 2011. In March 2012, the same commission recorded a 30-year record high of 1,158 short-term detentions in a single month just before the visit of Pope Benedict XVI.<br/>Among the many abuses cited by the 2012 report are the prison sentences handed out to members of the Unión Patriotica de Cuba, the estimated 3,000 citizens held under the charge of "potential dangerousness," state-orchestrated assaults against the Damas de Blanco (Ladies in White), the suspicious death of dissident Oswaldo Payá and so on.<br/>As in any dictatorship, telling the truth is a crime: Independent journalist Calixto Ramón Martínez Arias, the first to report on the cholera outbreak in Cuba, was jailed in September for the crime of desacato (insulting speech) and remained there until last week.<br/>The regime is willing to undertake some meek economic reforms to keep people employed. It has even dared to relax its travel requirements to allow more Cubans to leave the country if they can get a passport.<br/>Both of these are short-term survival measures, designed as escape valves for growing internal pressure. But when it comes to free speech, political activity and freedom of association — the building blocks of a free society — the report is a depressing chronicle of human-rights abuses and a valuable reminder that repression is the Castro regime’s only response to those who demand a genuinely free Cuba. Fundamental reform? Not a chance.</p><h4 id="HRejecttheaff-Moraldutytoshunhumanrightsabusers-5" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Reject the aff- Moral duty to shun human rights abusers</span></h4><p><strong>Beversluis 89</strong> — Eric H. Beversluis, Professor of Philosophy and Economics at Aquinas College, holds an A.B. in Philosophy and German from Calvin College, an M.A. in Philosophy from Northwestern University, an M.A. in Economics from Ohio State University, and a Ph.D. in the Philosophy of Education from Northwestern University, 1989 ("On Shunning Undesirable Regimes: Ethics and Economic Sanctions," Public Affairs Quarterly, Volume 3, Number 2, April, Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via JSTOR, p. 17-19)<br/>A fundamental task of morality is resolving conflicting interests. If we both want the <br/>AND<br/>rage. Thus ethics identifies the rights of individuals when their interests conflict.<br/>But how can a case for shunning be made on this view of morality? <br/>AND<br/>, on what grounds might it be a duty to impose such sanctions?<br/>We find the answer when we note that there is another "level" of <br/>AND<br/>rights of others with one’s actions but also to support that moral order.<br/>Consider that the moral order itself contributes significantly to people’s rights being respected. It <br/>AND<br/>it indirectly affects people’s rights. And this is where shunning fits in.<br/>Certain types of behavior constitute a direct attack on the moral order. When the <br/>AND<br/>three conditions which turn immoral behavior into an attack on the moral order.<br/>An immoral action is flagrant if it is "extremely or deliberately conspicuous; notorious<br/>AND<br/>reaffirms the legitimacy of that moral order. How does shunning do this?<br/>First, by refusing publicly to have to do with such a person one announces support for the moral order and backs up the announcement with action. This action reinforces the commitment to the moral order both of the shunner and of the other members of the community. (Secretary of State Shultz in effect made this argument in his call for international sanctions on Libya in the early days of 1986.)<br/>Further, shunning may have a moral effect on the shunned person, even if the direct impact is not adequate to change the immoral behavior. If the shunned person thinks of herself as part of the moral community, shunning may well make clear to her that she is, in fact, removing herself from that community by the behavior in question. Thus shunning may achieve by moral suasion what cannot be achieved by "force."<br/>Finally, shunning may be a form of punishment, of moral sanction, whose appropriateness depends not on whether it will change the person’s behavior, but on whether he deserves the punishment for violating the moral order. Punishment then can be viewed as a way of maintaining the moral order, of "purifying the community" after it has been made "unclean," as ancient communities might have put it.<br/>Yet not every immoral action requires that we shun. As noted above, we <br/>AND<br/>on the moral order itself through flagrant, willful, and persistent wrongdoing. <br/>We can also now see why failure to shun can under certain circumstances suggest complicity. But it is not that we have a duty to shun because failure to do so suggests complicity. Rather, because we have an obligation to shun in certain circumstances, when we fail to do so others may interpret our failure as tacit complicity in the willful, persistent, and flagrant immorality.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h1 id="H4-5" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>4</span></h1><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HText:TheUnitedStatesExecutiveBranchshouldpursuetradeliberalizationwithCubaforagriculturecommoditiesifandonlyiftheRepublicofCubaagreestocombathumanrightsabuses-1" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Text: The United States Executive Branch should pursue trade liberalization with Cuba for agriculture commodities if and only if the Republic of Cuba agrees to combat human rights abuses</span></h4><h4 id="HWeshouldcontinuetodemandsignificantreformsbeforerelaxingU.S.policy-4" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>We should continue to demand significant reforms before relaxing U.S. policy</span></h4><p>José R. <strong>Cárdenas</strong>, Nov. 13, <strong>’12</strong>, an associate with the consulting firm VisionAmericas, former Acting Assistant Administrator for Latin America and the Caribbean and Senior Advisor at the Organization of American States and as a senior professional staff member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, "Cuba policy in a second Obama term," Foreign Policy, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://shadow.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/11/13/cuba_policy_in_a_second_obama_term  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://shadow.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/11/13/cuba_policy_in_a_second_obama_term%27" tppabs="http://shadow.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/11/13/cuba_policy_in_a_second_obama_term"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://shadow.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/11/13/cuba_policy_in_a_second_obama_term</span></a></span>, ACC. 6-1-2013, JT<em>JEDI<br/>Secondly, critics have convinced themselves that if it weren’t for the Cuban American lobby, the U.S. would have long ago reached an accommodation with the Castro dictatorship.

"Cuba had to produce twice as much food, with less than half the chemical inputs," according to the COSG. Land was switched from export crops to food production, and tractors were switched for oxen. People were encouraged to move from the city to the land and organic farming methods were introduced. <br/>"Integrated pest management, crop rotation, composting and soil conservation were implemented," says the COSG. The country had to become expert in techniques like worm composting and biopesticides. "Worms and worm farm technology is now a Cuban export," says Dr Stephen Wilkinson, assistant director of the International Institute for the Study of Cuba.<br/>Thus, the unique system of organoponicos, or urban organic farming, was started<br/>AND<br/>says, food intake is back at 2,600 calories a day.<br/>Organoponico plaza<br/>A visit to Havana’s largest organoponico, the three-hectare Organoponico Plaza, which lies a stone’s throw from the city’s Plaza de la Revolución and the desk of Raul Castro, confirms that the scheme is doing well. Rows of strikingly neat irrigated raised beds are home to seasonal crops of lettuces, spring onions, chives, garlic and parsley. <br/>Guava and noni fruit trees provide shade around the perimeter, while on the far side compost piles sit next to plastic tunnels used to raise seedlings. Outside in the shop, signs extol the virtues of eating your greens. <br/>The shop is open only on Mondays. Produce is sold by the people who work the garden (they keep 50 of sales, so are motivated to produce a lot) to the people who live nearby. In this case, the organoponico serves an estate that wouldn’t look out of place in Tower Hamlets or Easterhouse. Yet inside, butterflies flit and the head gardener, Toni, turns sod like he is digging at Prince Charles’s Highgrove estate.<br/>A success then? "In terms of improving the diet of the population it has had a beneficial effect," says Wilkinson.<br/>"And it has been a success in terms of meeting some of the food security needs," he says, "but it has not resolved the problem since the island still imports a great deal of food."<br/>And change is on the horizon, which might be good for living standards, <br/>AND<br/>pesticide and fertiliser use mainly due to "financial constraints, not choice".</p><h4 id="HTurnsag-Wormsarekeytoourplanetarysurvival.Vermicompostingexpertiseislimited-2" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Turns ag - Worms are key to our planetary survival. &nbsp;Vermicomposting expertise is limited</span></h4><p>Blakemore 10 - Studied ’VermEcology’ for 30 years and holds qualifications in ecology, computing and permaculture. ~Dr. Rob Blakemore, "Wonder Worm to the rescue," Our World 2.0, July 2, 2010, pg. <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://ourworld.unu.edu/en/wonder-worm-to-the-rescue/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://ourworld.unu.edu/en/wonder-worm-to-the-rescue/%27" tppabs="http://ourworld.unu.edu/en/wonder-worm-to-the-rescue/"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://ourworld.unu.edu/en/wonder-worm-to-the-rescue/</span></a></span></p><p>Can worms help save the planet? I think so and, before arguing my case, please let me state my position from the start: I am an ecologist. Not just the type of trendy person who faithfully recycles — although I am fashionably green and a semi-vegetarian who tries to recycle as many beer bottles as possible. No, I am also the other, scientific kind. <br/>The science of ecology is generally defined as a study of organisms and their environment, i.e., everything21 However, I would be somewhat more categorical and say that it is "The study of organisms, their products whether alive or dead, and their environment" — i.e., even more of everything, including fossil fuels and human endeavour21<br/>An ecologist then, is someone who considers holistic workings of a natural ecosystem in all its complexity and diversity throughout its time-cycle while breaking it down into its component parts and honing in on its few key, controlling entities. Simultaneously practicing as a generalist and as a multi-faceted specialist. <br/>Deeds of the dirt<br/>The experience of growing up in rural England alongside my grandfather, the village farrier <br/>AND<br/>the living organisms, paramount amongst which is the humble, hidden earthworm.<br/>Here I must air my strong objections to marine biologists such as Sylvia Earle who pointed out after winning the TED 2009 Prize that the oceans make up 70 of the surface of the Earth and the rest is just "dirt".<br/>Approximately 99.4 of our food and fibre is produced on land and only 0.6 comes from oceans and other aquatic ecosystems combined, according to FAO. The calorific value obtained from ocean catches, freshwater fishing and aquaculture adds up to just about 10-16 of the current human total. (These figures are slightly skewed for maritime countries like Japan and Iceland but still, more than 80 of our nutrition is terrestrial in origin).<br/>Furthermore, I am sure Dr. Earle accepts that the oceanic ecosystem is wholly dependent upon dissolved nutrients washed down or blown from the soil and is similarly affected by pollution mainly from activity on the land. Her survival depends as much as anyone’s on the "just dirt" part.<br/>Thus it is abysmal that scientific knowledge of the oceans is infinitely deeper than for terrestrial ecosystems. Moreover, Leonardo da Vinci’s observed 500 years ago that "We know more about the movement of celestial bodies than about the soil underfoot" and this still rings true today. The journal Science, realizing that our knowledge is so scant, produced a special 2004 issue entitled Soils — The Final Frontier.<br/>Why waste precious funds and brain resources on the vain discovery of useless planets overhead or new deep-sea species that will still be there tomorrow, while vital unrecognized organisms literally beneath our feet disappear at an increasingly alarming rate and to our peril?<br/>Why are we not concentrating our efforts and valuable resources on protecting and preserving the tangible deeds of our earthly home patch for current and future generations of Earthlings? Where on earth is our Soil Ecology Institute?<br/>Global worming <br/>We talk of greenhouse gasses and global warming yet it is the lithosphere, not <br/>AND<br/>an Our World 2.0 article on this ’ red hot power’.)<br/>Proper management of our arable, pastoral and forest soils is the most practically feasible mechanism to sequester atmospheric carbon without any adverse effects. Atmospheric carbon is entirely recycled via the soil from plants in around 12-20 years — all of this being processed through the intestines of worms.<br/>Vermicomposting of organics and encouraging soil biodiversity by rebuilding humus provides a natural closed-system remedy with neither waste nor loss of productivity.<br/>Down-to-Earth soil species <br/>All manner of dirt and disease always ends up in the sod and consequentially its ecology is naturally robust. Yet, the soil suffers the most profound and significant effects from over-exploitation and faces the greatest threat from erosion, destruction and pollution with artificial chemicals and/or transgenes.<br/>Despite its importance, soil biodiversity is so poorly known that even obvious organisms like the relatively large worms are mostly unclassified. On each field trip I find new species and, of the 10,000 that have been given scientific names thus far (perhaps less than a third of the total), we know something of the ecology about a dozen species.<br/>But what we do know doesn’t look good. Unprecedented loss of species abundance and diversity combined with high extinction rates are bringing Earth into new and uncharted territory. We urgently need triage.<br/>Laboratories crammed with scores of ecologists could study just worms for their whole careers and still we would only progress slightly from our current poor state of knowledge, but our gain would be justifiable and have tangible effects on resolving pressing environmental issues. But this is not the current situation.<br/>Fundamentally we can justify study of soil ecology because it affects all our lives and <br/>AND<br/>healthy soil in which any healthy crop could develop in the first place.<br/>If we ask "Which group of organisms would cause the most disruption to life <br/>AND<br/>claim such importance for their study subject? <br/>Looking forward to the past<br/>One of the main predictions, highly optimistic, in the revolutionary move into our post-industrial era (see Alvin Toffler’s The Third Wave for details) was that genetic engineering would provide new production methods and have profound effects on future development. In many ways this has been borne out in medical use and microbial ’manufacture’ with genetically modified organisms (GMOs) that provide some potential benefit and serve some purpose, albeit at huge cost.<br/>But there are equally large risks. Rather obviously, the main characteristic of life is to reproduce and disperse. The architects of the modified corn, cotton, soy, wheat, rice and spuds are often of exactly the same companies (or at least profit-driven mind-sets) that produced the toxic chemicals that they are now telling us their new GMO technology will replace — just as chemical engineers promised solutions to all our problems previously.<br/>In 1962 Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring first alerted us to risks of agricultural chemical pollution, exacerbated by bioaccumulation in body tissue (especially of invertebrates such as earthworms) and bioconcentration further up the food-chain. But whatever the problem, these chemicals will eventually disperse and decline once production halts.<br/>With biology the reverse is true. Design a plant to be herbicide or insect resistant and it will increase and spread by its own means, by cross-pollination or genetic drift. Case in point is the illegitimate escape in Japan of feral oilseed rape ( Brassica napus) genetically modified to resist herbicide that, as with any similar calamity, will continue in an uncontrollable fashion.<br/>Rather than addressing immediate environmental issues per se, much of scientific resources are diverted into molecular studies, mostly for industrial agricultural production, that are inordinately expensive, or into agronomic trials of effective toxic biocide applications. Mostly this is not requested by informed consumers nor by farmers who must rely on the advice of often industry-funded ’experts’ and extension officers (hopefully not advertisers).<br/>Surprisingly and shamefully, almost zero funding is available for research on organic production ’alternatives’ that are dismissed as impractical fads. Yet it is their implementation, since the start of the agricultural revolution 10,000 years ago, that has brought us this far.<br/>Let’s not let topsoil slip through our fingers <br/>Topsoil is the most valuable resource upon which civilizations depend. Its rapid loss combined with soil fertility and soil health decline are of greatest immediate concern.<br/>How important is loss of topsoil? Basically without fertile topsoil there is no plant <br/>AND<br/>seriously degraded, according to the UN’S 2005 Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA).<br/>Loss of topsoil has been due to the combined effects of desertification, salinization, <br/>AND<br/>degraded, and Asia, where 11 is now unsuitable for farming.<br/>In addition to those pollutants commonly recognized as originating from biocides and fertilizers, there are many other sources — such as antibiotics associated with intensive animal production, plus a ’cocktail’ of human-processed pollutants like drugs, solvents and synthetic hormones from birth control pills — that all make their way into the environment in an infinite variety of unforeseeable combinations.<br/>Suggested remediation to soil decline and agricultural production are to use GMO crops and other high-tech applications, because there is an assumption that topsoil formation is a centuries-old process that is essentially non-renewable and thus is gone forever. This view is false and there are several examples of methods that can be applied to restore fertile topsoils to farms, and in a time frame as short as a matter of a few years.<br/>Feed the worm <br/>"When the question is asked, ’Can I build top-soil?’ the answer is ’Yes’, and when the first question is followed by a second question, ’How?’ the answer is ’Feed earthworms’," so wrote Eve Balfour in the introduction to Thomas J. Barrett’s book, Harnessing the Earthworm.<br/>Indeed there are many instances of organic farms around the world preserving or restoring healthy <br/>AND<br/>well known and widely adopted by national and local communities and individuals worldwide.<br/>William Blake urged us "~t~o see a world in a grain of sand and a heaven in a wildflower". Soil survey of &nbsp;the abundance and diversity of earthworms in a soil will provide a good measure of natural fertility, as these are the monitors and mediators of soil health. &nbsp;That some of our honourable predecessors appreciated the worm’s role is manifest by one translation of the Chinese characters for ’earthworms’ being ’angels of the earth’.<br/>Seeing a worm turned up by the plough and eaten by a bird started Prince Siddhartha (Gautama Buddah) on his contemplative path to understanding the Cycle-of-Life. In the Classical world, the ’father of biology’, Aristotle, called earthworms the "soil’s entrails" and it is reported that Cleopatra decreed them sacred.<br/>Charles Darwin, British naturalist and father of evolution, also had an interest in <br/>AND<br/>of earthworms on soils and plant growth, and thus on human survival.<br/>Believing his worm work one of his most crucial contributions, Darwin <br/>stated:<br/>"It may be doubted whether there are many other animals which have played so important a part in the history of the world, as have these lowly organized creatures…<br/>"The vegetable mould ~humus~ which covers, as with a mantle, the surface of the land, has all passed many times through their bodies."<br/>Hopefully it will continue thus.<br/>In 1981, as a centennial tribute to Darwin’s seminal work, I completed a <br/>AND<br/>cost savings in chemicals and environmental degradation. (Details are presented here.)<br/>Look up to the worm <br/>My thesis is that each of the three major interlinked influences on our world – <br/>AND<br/>-process organic ’wastes’ via worms, for a natural compost fertilizer.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HTheagroecologicalrevolutionissweepingLatinAmericainthestatusquo-2" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>The agroecological revolution is sweeping Latin America in the status quo</span></h4><p><strong>Altieri 26 Toledo 11</strong><br/>Miguel A.

If we both want the <br/>AND<br/>rage. Thus ethics identifies the rights of individuals when their interests conflict.<br/>But how can a case for shunning be made on this view of morality? <br/>AND<br/>, on what grounds might it be a duty to impose such sanctions?<br/>We find the answer when we note that there is another "level" of <br/>AND<br/>rights of others with one’s actions but also to support that moral order.<br/>Consider that the moral order itself contributes significantly to people’s rights being respected. It <br/>AND<br/>it indirectly affects people’s rights. And this is where shunning fits in.<br/>Certain types of behavior constitute a direct attack on the moral order. When the <br/>AND<br/>three conditions which turn immoral behavior into an attack on the moral order.<br/>An immoral action is flagrant if it is "extremely or deliberately conspicuous; notorious<br/>AND<br/>reaffirms the legitimacy of that moral order. How does shunning do this?<br/>First, by refusing publicly to have to do with such a person one announces support for the moral order and backs up the announcement with action. This action reinforces the commitment to the moral order both of the shunner and of the other members of the community. (Secretary of State Shultz in effect made this argument in his call for international sanctions on Libya in the early days of 1986.)<br/>Further, shunning may have a moral effect on the shunned person, even if the direct impact is not adequate to change the immoral behavior. If the shunned person thinks of herself as part of the moral community, shunning may well make clear to her that she is, in fact, removing herself from that community by the behavior in question. Thus shunning may achieve by moral suasion what cannot be achieved by "force."<br/>Finally, shunning may be a form of punishment, of moral sanction, whose appropriateness depends not on whether it will change the person’s behavior, but on whether he deserves the punishment for violating the moral order. Punishment then can be viewed as a way of maintaining the moral order, of "purifying the community" after it has been made "unclean," as ancient communities might have put it.<br/>Yet not every immoral action requires that we shun. As noted above, we <br/>AND<br/>on the moral order itself through flagrant, willful, and persistent wrongdoing. <br/>We can also now see why failure to shun can under certain circumstances suggest complicity. But it is not that we have a duty to shun because failure to do so suggests complicity. Rather, because we have an obligation to shun in certain circumstances, when we fail to do so others may interpret our failure as tacit complicity in the willful, persistent, and flagrant immorality.</p><h1 id="HCP" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>CP</span></h1><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HText:TheUnitedStatesfederalgovernmentshouldsubstantiallyincreaseitsinvestmentinanationalnetworkofliquidfluorinethoriumnuclearenergyreactors." class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Text: The United States federal government should substantially increase its investment in a national network of liquid fluorine thorium nuclear energy reactors.</span></h4><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HTheplansolvesfossilfueldependence2013expertiseandempiricsprove" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>The plan solves fossil fuel dependence – expertise and empirics prove</span></h4><p><strong>Cowan 10 (Aaron, The Examiner, internally cites Dr. Carlo Rubbia, an Italian particle physicist who won the 1984 Nobel Prize in Physics, graduate of Scuola Normale in Italy, PhD in physics from Columbia University, former President of the National Agency for Atomic Energy, August 30, 2010, "Thorium could replace oil and coal in five years says Nobel prize winner," <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.examiner.com/article/thorium-could-replace-oil-and-coal-five-years-says-nobel-prize-winner  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.examiner.com/article/thorium-could-replace-oil-and-coal-five-years-says-nobel-prize-winner%27" tppabs="http://www.examiner.com/article/thorium-could-replace-oil-and-coal-five-years-says-nobel-prize-winner"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.examiner.com/article/thorium-could-replace-oil-and-coal-five-years-says-nobel-prize-winner</span></a></span>, alp)&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Particle physicist and Nobel prize winner Carlo Rubbia claims that mankind could get all its <br/>AND<br/>due to the government’s current willingness to provide funding for nuclear projects again.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h1 id="HHeg" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Heg</span></h1><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HContainmentpolicieshurtUS-Chinarelations-pivotpushedustothebrink" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Containment policies hurt US-China relations- pivot pushed us to the brink</span></h4><p><strong>Ikenson, 13&nbsp;</strong>(Dan Ikenson is an author, speaker and Director of Cato’s Herbert A.

Beversluis, Professor of Philosophy and Economics at Aquinas College, holds an A.B. in Philosophy and German from Calvin College, an M.A. in Philosophy from Northwestern University, an M.A. in Economics from Ohio State University, and a Ph.D. in the Philosophy of Education from Northwestern University, 1989 ("On Shunning Undesirable Regimes: Ethics and Economic Sanctions," Public Affairs Quarterly, Volume 3, Number 2, April, Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via JSTOR, p. 17-19)<br/>A fundamental task of morality is resolving conflicting interests. If we both want the <br/>AND<br/>rage. Thus ethics identifies the rights of individuals when their interests conflict.<br/>But how can a case for shunning be made on this view of morality? <br/>AND<br/>, on what grounds might it be a duty to impose such sanctions?<br/>We find the answer when we note that there is another "level" of <br/>AND<br/>rights of others with one’s actions but also to support that moral order.<br/>Consider that the moral order itself contributes significantly to people’s rights being respected. It <br/>AND<br/>it indirectly affects people’s rights. And this is where shunning fits in.<br/>Certain types of behavior constitute a direct attack on the moral order. When the <br/>AND<br/>three conditions which turn immoral behavior into an attack on the moral order.<br/>An immoral action is flagrant if it is "extremely or deliberately conspicuous; notorious<br/>AND<br/>reaffirms the legitimacy of that moral order. How does shunning do this?<br/>First, by refusing publicly to have to do with such a person one announces support for the moral order and backs up the announcement with action. This action reinforces the commitment to the moral order both of the shunner and of the other members of the community. (Secretary of State Shultz in effect made this argument in his call for international sanctions on Libya in the early days of 1986.)<br/>Further, shunning may have a moral effect on the shunned person, even if the direct impact is not adequate to change the immoral behavior. If the shunned person thinks of herself as part of the moral community, shunning may well make clear to her that she is, in fact, removing herself from that community by the behavior in question. Thus shunning may achieve by moral suasion what cannot be achieved by "force."<br/>Finally, shunning may be a form of punishment, of moral sanction, whose appropriateness depends not on whether it will change the person’s behavior, but on whether he deserves the punishment for violating the moral order. Punishment then can be viewed as a way of maintaining the moral order, of "purifying the community" after it has been made "unclean," as ancient communities might have put it.<br/>Yet not every immoral action requires that we shun. As noted above, we <br/>AND<br/>on the moral order itself through flagrant, willful, and persistent wrongdoing. <br/>We can also now see why failure to shun can under certain circumstances suggest complicity. But it is not that we have a duty to shun because failure to do so suggests complicity. Rather, because we have an obligation to shun in certain circumstances, when we fail to do so others may interpret our failure as tacit complicity in the willful, persistent, and flagrant immorality.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HRejecttheaffasameanstocreatespaceforalternativestoneoliberalengagement." class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Reject the aff as a means to create space for alternatives to neoliberal engagement.</span></h4><p>Munck, professor of Globalization and Social Exclusion, 3 (Ronaldo, Department of Sociology, Social Policy 26 Social Work Studies and Globalisation and Social Exclusion Unit, University of Liverpool, "Neoliberalism, necessitarianism and alternatives in Latin America: there is no alternative (TINA)?", Third World Quarterly, Vol 24, No 3, pp 495–511, 2003, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www-e.uni-magdeburg.de/evans/Journal20Library/Trade20and20Countries/Neoliberalism  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www-e.uni-magdeburg.de/evans/Journal20Library/Trade20and20Countries/Neoliberalism%27" tppabs="http://www-e.uni-magdeburg.de/evans/Journal20Library/Trade20and20Countries/Neoliberalism"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www-e.uni-magdeburg.de/evans/Journal20Library/Trade20and20Countries/Neoliberalism</span></a></span>,20necessitarianism20and20alternatives20in20Latin20America.pdf, ZBurdette)</p><p>Taking as its point of departure the position that there are or must be alternatives <br/>AND<br/>is back in the foreground of thinking and practice around alternative economic theories.<br/>There is no alternative (TINA) was an oft-repeated expression of Margaret <br/>AND<br/>underline the urgency of developing a credible and viable alternative to its policies.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h1 id="H5-6" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>5</span></h1><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HTheUnitedStatesfederalgovernmentshouldprovidetechnicalassistancetothegovernmentofMexicoforimplementationofcommercialdomesticintellectualpropertyprotectionsifandonlyifMexicodemonstratesthathumanrightsconditionshavesignificantlyimproved.TheUSFGshouldenactaperiodiccertificationprocesstodeterminethatabusesareeffectivelyinvestigatedandprosecuted." class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>The United States federal government should provide technical assistance to the government of Mexico for implementation of commercial domestic intellectual property protections if and only if Mexico demonstrates that human rights conditions have significantly improved.
