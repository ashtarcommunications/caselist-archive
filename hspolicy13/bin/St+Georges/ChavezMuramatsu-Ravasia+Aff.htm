During that period, it is estimated that power generation in Central and South America will increase from 882 billion kWh in 2004 to 1,838 billion kWh in 2030, representing an increase of 2.9 percent per year. In North America the annual growth in electricity generation is expected to change by 1.5 percent per year during this period (EIA, 2007). This increase in electricity generation will involve substantial capital investment,&nbsp;</p><p>AND <br/>deforestation in the rural area can be avoided by expanding electricity services to rural areas as part of a regional electricity cooperation approach. Other environmental benefit accrues from increased electricity integration is the mitigation of negative environmental impacts generated by new power sector facilities, which can be avoided through the interconnection of the existent power infrastructures (Zhu et al., 2004) and by the adequate operational management of these facilities, which entails the harmonization of technical and legal standards (Seymour et al., 2005).

When Columbus sailed through the Caribbean in the 1490s, he contrasted the peaceful Arawaks of Cuba to the aggressive, allegedly cannibalistic Caribs to the southeast (Hulme, 1994: 169–171, 190). European and U.S. imperialists, as well as Latin American elites, employed similar discursive strategies over the following centuries.2 In the early twentieth century, both the jingoists led by Theodore Roosevelt and the Wilsonian “idealists” contrasted the unruly children of Central America and the Caribbean with the more responsible leaders in the bigger Latin American countries. Woodrow Wilson and his appointees pledged to replace the “naughty children” of Latin America with “good men,” whom they would “teach the South American republics to elect” (Schoultz, 1998: 244, 272, 192–197; Kenworthy, 1995: 30; cf. Johnson, 1980: 209, 217; Black, 1988). &nbsp;Later, following the 1959 Cuban Revolution, U.S. policy came to focus on assisting the good Latins while isolating, and often exterminating, the bad; many of the tropes used to characterize Hugo Chávez in the past decade have clear precedents in government and press depictions of Fidel Castro starting four decades earlier (Platt et al., 1987; Johnson, 1980: 113, 241; Landau, 2006; Chomsky, 2008). Similar binary depictions have long characterized Orientalist discourse toward Asian and African peoples, particularly Muslims (Mamdani, 2004).<br/>Historically these distinctions have helped to justify outside intervention in the name of “protecting” the good from the bad, and today the “benevolent interventionist” frame often accompanies the good-left/bad-left frame. Just as Columbus was protecting the peaceful Arawaks from the savage Caribs, the U.S. government promotes democracy through its relations with the good left, protecting those countries from the bad left. By definition, all such interventions are undertaken with noble and humanitarian intent. This paternalistic discourse has remained remarkably consistent throughout the history of imperialism and internal colonialism, albeit with new rhetorical demons and pretexts in each successive epoch: corruption, endemic revolts, and European intervention in Wilson’s day, Communism during the Cold War, and autocrats, populists, terrorists, and drug cartels since the Soviet Union’s collapse. The main demons are typically external to Latin America—often associated with the “Old World,” the Soviet Union, or, more recently, various Asian and Middle Eastern countries—but there are usually internal demons, too (Kenworthy, 1995: 18–37).<br/>Press coverage of right-wing coups against Venezuela’s Hugo Chávez in 2002 and Honduras’s Manuel Zelaya in 2009, and of the U.S. government’s role in and after those coups, offers stark examples of media support (open or tacit) for recent U.S. interventionism. In both cases the U.S. response was accompanied by reports and opinion pieces about legitimate U.S. security concerns and honest regard for democracy. In addition to praising U.S. motives, news reports, opinion pieces, and intellectual commentary often implied that Latin Americans both needed and wanted U.S. intervention.<br/>Status quo engagement strategies reinforce imperialist policies which guarantee a hierarchal conception of international relations <br/>Frankzi, University of London, Birkbeck College, School of Law, Graduate Student, 12<br/>(Hannah, Center for InterAmerican Studies, Bielefeld University, Universitat Bielefeld, “Eurocentrism,” <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://elearning.uni-bielefeld.de/wikifarm/fields/ges_cias/field.php/Main/Unterkapitel52  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://elearning.uni-bielefeld.de/wikifarm/fields/ges_cias/field.php/Main/Unterkapitel52%27" tppabs="http://elearning.uni-bielefeld.de/wikifarm/fields/ges_cias/field.php/Main/Unterkapitel52"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://elearning.uni-bielefeld.de/wikifarm/fields/ges_cias/field.php/Main/Unterkapitel52</span></a></span>, Accessed: 7/3/13, LPS.)</p><p>Researchers contributing to the Latin American Modernidad / Colonialidad research programme have drawn attention to the mythical character of this narrative by arguing that coloniality, understood as a pattern of European violence in the colonies, and modernity need to be understood as two sides of the same coin. They also stress the constitutive role of the “discovery” of the Americas which enables Europe to situate itself at the economic and epistemological centre of the modern world system. The modern idea of universal history, that is the writing of history of humankind in a frame of progressive and linear time, has also been criticised as inherently Eurocentric. This is because it construes the European development as following the normal and necessary course of history and consequently only accommodates the experience of other world regions in relation to it. The construction of the Americas through a European lens is epitomised by the fact that for a long time most accounts of American history started with the arrival of the settlers (Muthyala 2001). Strategies deployed to challenge this Eurocentric master narrative have involved replacing discovery with disaster to stress the violence inherent in the process which was a key part of European modernity. <br/>Geopolitics of Knowledge <br/>In contrast to more localised ethnocentrisms, Eurocentrism shapes the production of knowledge and its proliferation well beyond Europe and the western hemisphere. This is possible, critics argue, due to an epistemology which pretends that knowledge has no locus. In western thought, Descartes' proclamation of a separation of body and mind has led to an image of the cognisant subject as abstracted from all social, sexual and racial realities (Grosfoguel 2006, pp. 20ff, Gandhi 1998: 34ff). In consequence, analytical categories such as state, democracy, equality, etc., formed against the background of particular European experience and are declared to be universally valid and applicable, independent of place (Chakrabarty 2002, p. 288). This leads, according to Edgardo Lander (2002, p. 22), to a naturalisation of liberal values and a devaluation of knowledge produced outside the prescribed scientific system. Europe's successful placing of itself at the centre of history also caused universities outside Europe to teach it from a Eurocentric point of view and include predominantly “northern” thinkers in their academic canons. Postcolonial scholarship has pointed out that knowledge produced in the global South is recognised if the respective academics are working in European or US-American universities (Castro-Gómez 2005, p. 35). As a means to challenge the hegemony of Eurocentric knowledge, indigenous universities have been founded in various Latin American countries. They demand that different ways of knowing be recognised as valid and suggest that indigenous knowledge can inspire new methodologies. <br/>US policies towards Cuba represent a systematic refusal of non-Western forms knowledge production <br/>Slater, Professor of Geography, Loughborough University 4<br/>(David, “The Gravity of Imperial Politics: Some Thoughts on Power and Representation”, The Arab World Geographer/Le Geographe du monde arabe, Vo 7,No 1-2, p.94-5)</p><p>The projection of American power at the turn of the 20th century assumed a variety of forms, so that while the Philippines became a colony, Cuba, until 1934, was a semi-protectorate. Violence and racist representation figured in both instances. In the Cuban case, for example, the U.S. undersecretary of war, J. C. Breckenridge, wrote in 1897 that the inhabitants of the island were "generally indolent and apathetic," "indifferent to religion," and therefore "immoral," and before any US. presence was to be institutionalized in Cuba, it would be necessary to "clean up the country," even if this meant using the "methods of Divine Providence used on the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah " Breckenridge went on to state that "we must destroy everything within our cannons' range of fire ... (w)e must impose a harsh blockade so that hunger and its constant companion, disease, undermine the peaceful population and decimate the Cuban army" (qtd. in Ricardo 1994, 45).<br/>Geopolitical Interventionism: Historical Elements of the U.S.-Cuba Encounter<br/>Cuba was formally placed under U.S. military rule in 1899 and this was accompanied by the dissolution of the institutions of the Cuban independence movement—the Liberation Army, the Provisional Government, and the Cuban Revolutionary Party, originally founded by Jose Marti. Cuba became a republic under U.S. tutelage in 1902. The Teller Amendment of 1898 prevented the United States from openly annexing the island. Passed by Congress when US. public opinion regarded military assistance for Cuba's struggle against Spain as heroic, the amendment stated that the United States disclaimed any intention of exercising sovereignty or control over the island except for the pacification thereof. The Teller Amendment was supported by those politicians who did not want the United States to annex an island inhabited by an "alien" people (see Smith 2000, 49) but the amendment also aimed to protect U.S. sugar producers from imports of cheap Cuban sugar. Senator Teller himself coming from the sugar-beet state of Colorado.<br/>As Cuba was brought into the orbit of U.S. power, the notion of "manifest destiny" was invoked, as it had been invoked at the time of other U.S. interventions in the nineteenth century; one writer asserted that "it is manifest destiny that the commerce and progress of the island shall follow American channels and adopt American forms" (Benjamin 1990, 54). The Platt Amendment, which was enacted by the U.S. Congress in 1901, became a key part of the 1903 Permanent Treaty between the two countries. The Cuban constitutional convention was informed that unless it added the Platt Amendment to the new constitution, U.S. military occupation would continue (Perez, Jr. 1997, 108-11). Delegates to the convention appended the Piatt Amendment to the Cuban constitution in 1902, but only by a margin of one vote. The Platt Amendment had seven articles that, in their entirety, effectively turned Cuba into a U.S. protectorate, provoking a continuous series of anti-US. protests and mobilizations throughout the early part of the 20th century.<br/>Our argument is that economic sanctions on Cuba frame them as a threat and refuse to identify with the people. The affirmative proposes Cuba as an example of how Eurocentrism is the primary groundwork of American policies and action. <br/>Specifically, economic sanctions on Cuba represent a refusal of non-Western knowledge. They are an extension of past policies which posit the island as primitive and immoral<br/>Slater, Professor of Geography, Loughborough University 4<br/>(David, “The Gravity of Imperial Politics: Some Thoughts on Power and Representation”, The Arab World Geographer/Le Geographe du monde arabe, Vo 7,No 1-2, p.97</p><p>According to the ruling perspective from Washington, the specificity of contemporary Cuba, or more accurately of the post-1959 Castro government, has been its alliance during the Cold-War period with the Soviet Union and its continuing adherence post-1989 to a communist political system. This specificity has been used by the United States not only as a justification for classifying Cuba as a threat to the United States and the Western hemisphere and, more recently, as a "rogue state," but also as a legitimization of its embargo or blockade of Cuba—an embargo that has been condemned by the United Nations and the Inter-American Juridical Committee, which has ruled that such a measure against Cuba violates international law (Chomsky 2000,2).8 <br/>The Cuban case might be considered to be too specific to act as a basis for broader interpretations, and certainly in the context of U.S.-Latin American relations, it has a unique geopolitical significance. However, it can also be argued that U.S.-Cuban relations express, in a rather concentrated form, a persistent theme in the history of U.S.-Latin American relations; for example, there are other cases of the United States assigning to itself a role that frames relations with Latin American societies so that their sovereignty is transgressed, as is especially evident in the case of US. policy in relation to the "war on drugs."9 However, it is also important to point out that the positing of a shared U.S.-Cuban interest in "representative democracy, market economy and freedom and prosperity," as well as in "self-determination" and "self-government," finds echoes in other situations where the United States assumes the role of defining another people's sovereignty, as can be seen in the current case of the occupation of Iraq (see Ali 2003 and Gregory 2004). There is something significant and specific here which relates to the issue of the particularity of U.S. imperial power and its representations of subordinated peoples. The imperial imagination in the case of the lone superpower has a specificity that is not always contextualized.

This problem is not peculiar to security studies. According to Barry Buzan and Richard Little, ‘there is no doubt that International Relations has been studied from a very Eurocentric perspective . . .’10 Eurocentrism is a complex idea but at its core is the assumption of European centrality in the human past and present.11 On this view, Europe is conceived as separate and distinct from the rest of the world, as self-contained and self-generating. Analysis of the past, present and future of world politics is carried out in terms – conceptual and empirical, political and normative – that take for granted this centrality and separation.12 Neither the content – social, political, economic and cultural – nor the geographical location of ‘Europe’ are fixed. Eurocentrism is about both a real and an imagined Europe. Over time, as Martin Lewis and Kären Wigen demonstrate, the location of Europe shifts, expands and contracts, eventually crossing the Atlantic and the Pacific and becoming synonymous with the ‘West’.13 Today, the ‘West’ is centred on the Anglophone US – a former European settler colony – and incorporates Western Europe, North America, Japan and the British settler societies of Oceania. There are few better examples of Eurocentrism than the notion that the end-point of development and modernisation is defined by the contemporary West.<br/>The Eurocentrism of conventional security studies takes different forms across the theoretic perspectives that constitute the field. For realists, a ‘general theory of international politics is necessarily based on the great powers’.14 In modern history those powers are overwhelmingly located in Europe and the West. Eurocentrism is therefore intrinsic to the way in which realism is constructed in International Relations (IR).15 The great antagonists of realism, the liberals, seek to regulate conflict and alleviate its humanitarian consequences through a turn to domestic and international institutions and norms. International institutions such as the League of Nations, the United Nations and the nuclear non-proliferation regime are largely the product of interstate diplomacy dominated by Western great powers.16 Moreover, liberal democracy and the ethical principles that inform liberal opinion are the product of purportedly European histories and intellectual trajectories, most prominently those associated with the Enlightenments.17 Many constructivists share similar commitments as in attempts to make sense of international order in Hobbesian, Lockean or Kantian terms.18 Recent efforts to move beyond the realist-liberal debate, such as Critical Security Studies, draw their core concept of human emancipation from these same intellectual traditions.19 Each of these traditions, as postcolonial thinkers take pains to point out, rest on profoundly Eurocentric and racist assumptions.20 As Immanuel Kant, a figure dear to both liberal and critical scholars, observed, ‘Humanity achieves its greatest perfection with the White race’.21<br/>Eurocentrism generates a variety of difficulties for the analysis of security relations, and world politics more generally.22 Two in particular motivate our argument here. First, as we have noted, questions of war and peace raised by great power competition are foundational for security thought and practice. As a result, security studies provides few categories for making sense of the historical experiences of the weak and the powerless who comprise most of the world’s population. By default, these experiences are conceived in categories derived from great power politics in the North. Consequently, national liberation struggles in the post-World War II era were thought of in Cold War terms by many US policymakers and defence intellectuals.23 Today, this categorical error is repeated in a new form. Armed resistance to Northern domination of the international system is subsumed largely under the category of ‘terrorism’. In contemporary usage this term legitimates state power and delegitimates the use of force by non-state actors.24 It assumes in advance that ‘terrorist’ acts are always illegitimate and unjustified. Understanding why the weak resist and the forms their resistance takes is not aided by calling them names.<br/>Second, and related, to the extent it addresses them at all, a Eurocentric security studies regards the weak and the powerless as marginal or derivative elements of world politics, as at best the site of liberal good intentions or at worst a potential source of threats.25 Missed are the multiple and integral relations between the weak and the strong. Across diverse fields of social inquiry, it is taken for granted that the weak and the strong must be placed in a common analytic frame, as together constitutive of events, processes and structures.26 In contrast IR, and security studies in particular, mainly proceed by attending to the powerful only. As Stanley Hoffmann notes, IR takes an ‘Athenian’ perspective on the world.27 For realism, with its focus on great powers, one-sided analysis of this kind is foundational. For liberal and some critical approaches to security studies, the weak are of interest but primarily as bearers of rights and objects of emancipation, that is, for their normative value in Western political theoretic terms.28 Failing to study the weak and the strong together, as jointly responsible for making history, hamstrings IR and security studies’ ability to make sense of world politics generally and North-South relations in particular.<br/>That the weak play an integral role in shaping world politics is harder to deny when a Southern resistance movement strikes at the heart of Northern power. In the wake of those attacks, a series of developments transformed international and domestic politics around the world in diverse ways. Wars are being fought; alliance relations reconfigured; security forces redeployed; borders reworked; civil liberties curtailed; departments of state created; and identities remade. Understanding security relations now requires that we discard Eurocentric assumptions about the world and how it works.<br/>Our aff is key to break down normative knowledge production on intersectional forms of oppressions <br/>Chandra, Post-Doctoral Researcher Planck Institute, 13<br/>(Uday, Max Planck institute for the Study of Religious and Ethnic Diversity, Department of Religious Diversity, Post-Doc, PhD Yale, Aug 2013, Yale University, “The Case for a Postcolonial Approach to the Study of Politics”, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://academia.edu/2364123/The_Case_for_a_Postcolonial_Approach_to_the_Study_of_Politics  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://academia.edu/2364123/The_Case_for_a_Postcolonial_Approach_to_the_Study_of_Politics%27" tppabs="http://academia.edu/2364123/The_Case_for_a_Postcolonial_Approach_to_the_Study_of_Politics"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://academia.edu/2364123/The_Case_for_a_Postcolonial_Approach_to_the_Study_of_Politics</span></a></span>, Accessed 7/12/13, NC)</p><p>Towards a Postcolonial Approach to Political Science<br/>The preceding section demonstrated how American political science research on the postcolonial world reproduces older colonial stereotypes and theories. In this section, I chart the path towards a postcolonial approach to the study of politics. Such an approach, I argue, calls for a sustained engagement with specific non-Western contexts as well as an openness to anthropological, historical, and area studies knowledge about them. A postcolonial approach can take many forms, but I highlight three possibilities here: &nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>(1) critiques of existing Eurocentric theories of comparative politics; <br/>(2) bottom-up ethnographic and historical understandings of politics in particular contexts; <br/>(3) re-evaluating key political concepts such as the state, democracy, nationalism, and war in the light of different non-Western experiences. <br/>The first of these postcolonial approaches expands on the previous section. The aim is to examine and deconstruct mainstream political science theories about the postcolonial world by unveiling their overt biases and blindspots. These biases and blindspots, it needs to be demonstrated, are not arbitrary, but tied to distinctly Eurocentric visions of politics and society. Such visions implicitly or explicitly privilege Western experiences over non-Western ones, deny any measure of coevalness, and recast the postcolonial as backward or underdeveloped. For instance, the study of democracy exhibited clear strains of Eurocentrism insofar as they assumed a priori that modern West is the “natural” home of democracy and the postcolonial world throws up inchoate versions of modern Western democracy. Similarly, the contemporary study of civil wars is crippled by its Eurocentric view of postcolonial conflicts as a function of structural inadequacies such as weak states, economic backwardness, and primordial ethnic divisions. &nbsp;<br/>To overcome these Eurocentric views, a second kind of postcolonial approach is warranted. The aim of this approach is to offer alternatives to mainstream political science theories via in-depth, bottom-up empirical understandings of politics in postcolonial settings. Interpretive research relying on ethnographic and/or historical methods is particularly well-suited to achieve this aim. Even statistical studies that are sensitive to contextual realities in the postcolonial world can do so. The “science” underlying political science should itself be reconsidered and revised beyond its current neo-positivist confines. Investigations of vernacular practices and experiences of democracy in countries as diverse as Mexico, Nigeria, Yemen, and India are a part of this approach. So, too, are meaning-centered explanations of why ordinary men and women in postcolonial settings participate in armed social conflicts and other risky forms of collective action. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>A third kind of postcolonial approach, complementing the first two, seeks to rethink and redefine key political concepts by ridding them of their existing Eurocentric biases. The interpenetration of power and knowledge arguably leaves its deepest imprint on concepts, which are vital building blocks for social-scientific theories. What “democracy” means in India or Mexico is likely to be quite different from the United States or Canada. Difference does not, however, imply that one can be judged as inherently superior to another. The European or American experience of democracy cannot, in particular, be universalized into an abstract general model of democracy. Likewise, the notion of “civil wars” conceals a latent conviction that only strong states that can conquer their peripheries can establish a legitimate monopoly of violence within a certain territory. Whether in the Americas, Asia or Africa, this conviction is inseparable from the violence wrought by European colonialism on subject populations in its quest for political order. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>Taken together, these postcolonial approaches to the study of politics call for “provincializing Europe,” as Dipesh Chakrabarty has argued recently, so that we can avoid treating European experiences as universals. This task is simultaneously theoretical and empirical as well as intellectual and practical. As such, it supplements ongoing efforts within the United States and Europe to produce critical scholarship on racial, gender, and sexual minorities, inequalities of class and status, and the interpenetration of power and knowledge in mainstream political science. To sum up, a postcolonial approach to politics is a radical endeavor that seeks to challenge mainstream knowledge on non-Western politics and society via sustained engagements with them.</p><p>In response to the dominant paradigm that influences policies and debates, a method of decolonization is needed.

(Mignolo, 2011, p. 189). &nbsp;¶ Decolonial thinking and writing first emerged in the initial formations of modernity from the experiences of and responses to European colonization in the Andean regions during the sixteenth century. &nbsp;The colonial context created a betweeness of cosmologies for the colonized. &nbsp;This consciousness of being between cultures within a dominant culture is the central feature of decolonial thought &nbsp;-- thinking from the borders created by a totalizing cosmology associated with European modernity. &nbsp;For example, the sixteenth century writings of Waman Puma de Ayala focused on ways to preserve Aymara and Kechua knowledge cultures and co-exist within the new world order (Mignolo, 2005). &nbsp;Today, decolonization is used among indigenous intellectuals around the world, where a variety of models of decolonial education have emerged. &nbsp;Decolonial thinking about education is rooted in the violent occlusion of ways of knowing and being among indigenous civilizations in the Americas within the imposition of a new world order. &nbsp;The conquest of the Americas meant the demolition of indigenous education and economic systems. &nbsp;European Renaissance universities, for example, were soon transplanted across the Atlantic that had no relation to the languages and histories of the native peoples. &nbsp;<br/>Eurocentrism frames decision-making - Contemporary calculus relies on logic that constructs threats.<br/>Lander, Central University of Venezuela Professor, 2k<br/>(Edgardo, Sociologist, Venezuelan, professor at the Central University of Venezuela and a Fellow of the Transnational Institute, 2000, Nepantla: Views from South, Volume 1, Issue 3, “Eurocentrism and Colonialism in Latin American Social Thought”, pg. 527-228¶ , <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/nepantla/summary/v001/1.3lander.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/nepantla/summary/v001/1.3lander.html%27" tppabs="http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/nepantla/summary/v001/1.3lander.html"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/nepantla/summary/v001/1.3lander.html</span></a></span>, Accessed 7/5/13, JB)</p><p>As the report points out, modern social sciences were developed in England, France, Italy ,Germany ,and the United States and were meant to deal with the social reality of those countries (Wallerstein 1996,23).From the fact that the rest of the world was segregated to be studied by other disciplines—anthropology and orientalism (23–28)—it is not possible, however, to conclude that those other territories, cultures, and peoples were not present as an implicit reference in all the disciplines. The separation between the studies of the modern European North Americans and the rest is made on the basis of assumptions in relation to others, assumptions that define them as essentially different. The superiority of modern industrial societies is defined in contrast with the inferiority of the non-modern.<br/>The problem with Eurocentrism in the social sciences is not only that its fundamental categories were created for a particular time and place and later used in a more or less creative or rigid manner to study other realities. The problem lies in the colonial imaginary from which Western social sciences constructed its interpretation of the world. This imaginary has permeated the social sciences of the whole world, making a great part of the social knowledge of the peripheral world equally Eurocentric.7 In those disciplines, the experience of European societies is naturalized: Its economic organization—the capitalist market—is the “natural form of organizing production. It corresponds to an individual universal psychology” (Wallerstein 1996,20). Its political organization—the modern European nation state— is the “natural” form of political existence. The different peoples of the planet are organized according to a notion of progress: on one hand the more advanced, superior ,modern societies; on the other, backward, traditional, nonmodern societies. In this sense, sociology, political theory, and economics have not been any less colonial or less liberal than anthropology or orientalism, disciplines where these assumptions have been more readily acknowledged. This is the basis of the cognitive and institutional network of development and of structural adjustment politics promoted by The Washington consensus.8<br/>It is a colonial system of knowledge that expresses and legitimizes the modern colonial world-system. Europe’s dominating position in the world structure of colonialism established a monopoly of the locus of enunciation of “objective,” scientific knowledge about the modern world (Mignolo1995,329). It is a perspective with only one subject (white, European, with the exclusion of every other subject and every other form or style of knowledge). This leads to the naturalization of this power structure, which comes to be explained as resulting from hierarchical differences in race, culture, or other classifying systems, which always envision the modern West as the maximum expression of human development. Any difference between the cultural patterns of the hegemonic powers and the rest of the world is seen as the expression of the intrinsic inferiority of all others, or as hindrances to be supplanted (forcefully if necessary) through the European-led civilizing or modernizing process. This system of knowledge has proved to be long lasting and has outlived colonialism as a foundation of today’s worldwide hegemonic structure of power (Quijano 2000).<br/>Specificially, traditional IR studies use discourse surrounding war and peace to justify imperialist policies &nbsp;<br/>Owen, Reader in Political Theory at the University of Southampton, 2 (David, Millennium: Journal of International Studies, Vol. 31, No. 3, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://mil.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/31/3/653  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://mil.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/31/3/653%27" tppabs="http://mil.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/31/3/653"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://mil.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/31/3/653</span></a></span>, pg. 659 date accessed 7/10/13 igm)</p><p>The first dimension concerns the relationship between positivist IR¶ theory and postmodernist IR ‘theory’ (and the examples illustrate the claims concerning pluralism and factionalism made in the introduction to this¶ section).

In Eurocentric narratives, the superiority of Europe is evident in its achievements in economic and political systems, technologies, and the high quality of life enjoyed by its societies. Eurocentrism is more than banal ethnocentric prejudice, however, as it is intimately tied to and indeed constituted in the violence and asymmetry of colonial and imperial encounters. Eurocentrism is what makes this violence not only possible, but also acceptable or justi?able. As such, Eurocentrism is the condition of possibility for Orientalism, the discursive and institutional grid of power/knowledge integral to the production and domination of the Orient as Other. Signi?cant critiques of Eurocentrism emerged in the context of post-World War II shifts in geopolitical power, including anticolonial and anti-imperial revolutionary movements. Even so, Eurocentric epistemologies continue to haunt the production of knowledge in geography in signi?cant and disturbing ways.<br/>In conventional Eurocentric tellings, Europe is the engineer and architect of modern agricultural, cultural, economic, political, and scienti?c innovations, including capitalism, democracy, and industrial, medical, and green revolutions. Concepts like ‘the rise of Europe’ and ‘the European miracle’ exemplify Eurocentric models of history and development. Europe’s so-called rise is explained in terms of superior social and environmental qualities deemed internal to it: inventiveness, rationality, capacity for abstract thought, outward looking, freedom loving, along with advantageous climate and geographies. Many of these cultural traits are said to be inherited from the Bible lands and ancient Greece and Rome – framed as Europe’s ancestral hearths – though their highest development is said to have been achieved ?rst in imperial England and then the United States of America – hence the term ‘Euro-Americanism’. In these narratives, progress and development ride what James Blaut calls ‘the westbound Orient Express’.<br/>As a consequence of the perceived historical movement of the westbound express, ‘Europe’ has morphed into the ‘West’ and now the ‘Global North’. These ?uid geographic imaginaries may refer to not only Europe and white settler societies like the United States, Canada, and Australia, but also Japan and any other region or group that envisions itself as the possessor or inheritor of European culture, values, and academic, political, and economic systems. At the same time, however, particular places within the West such as the United States are privileged as the source of universal theory, while others like New Zealand are framed as limited by their particularities. Latin America and the Caribbean were colonized by Europeans, but are rarely included in the West. In short, it may not always be clear to what exactly these geographical imaginaries refer, but they are used as though they correspond to a commonsensical external reality.

But the result of this fundamental problem is flawed knowledge about the world. Eurocentricity is therefore a dual problem concerning both the authors and the content of knowledge, and cannot be resolved through normative commitments alone. It is not only the voices of the colonised, but the histories of colonialism, which have been glaring in their absence from the discipline of International Relations. <br/>Overcoming eurocentricity therefore requires not only concerted effort from the centre to create space and listen to hitherto marginalised voices, but also commitment to correcting the flaws in prevailing knowledge – and it is not only ‘the Other’ who can and should elaborate this critique. A vitally important implication of objectivity is that it is the responsibility of European and American, just as much as non-American or nonEuropean scholars, to decolonise IR. The importance of objectivity in social inquiry defended here can perhaps be seen as a form of epistemological internationalism. It is not necessary to be African to attempt to tell a more accurate account of the history of Europe’s role in the making of the contemporary Africa and the rest of the world, for example, or to write counter-histories of ‘the expansion of international society’ which detail the systematic barbarity of so-called Western civilisation. It is not necessary to have been colonised to recognise and document the violence, racism, genocide and dispossession which have characterised European expansion over five hundred years. <br/>In the same way that colonization of Latin America ushered in a paradigm shift, it is the logical starting point for a discussion of decolonizing education<br/>Baker, graduate Student, Education and Human Development, University of Rodchester, ‘9<br/>(Michael, Graduate Student at the Warner Graduate School of Education and Human Development at the University of Rodchester, June 2009, Unpublished Paper,“Situating Modern Western Education Within the Modern/Colonial World System,” <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://rochester.academia.edu/MichaelBaker  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://rochester.academia.edu/MichaelBaker%27" tppabs="http://rochester.academia.edu/MichaelBaker"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://rochester.academia.edu/MichaelBaker</span></a></span>, P.14, Accessed: 7/12/13, LPS.)</p><p>From Mexico to Argentina, the violence of the European culture of conquest and colonization continued after decolonization in Latin America’s own self-fashioning. The nation-state’s appearance as the agent of civilization in the nineteenth-century involves the reformation of Eurocentric modernity in which the racialized violence linked to capitalism is rationalized as the natural expansion of universal reason and scientific truth (Coronil, 1997, p. 74). ¶ The civilizing alterization experience of Latin America offers a way of thinking differently about the politics and ethics of knowledge, language, and education relevant to the experiences and histories of all locations within the modern/colonial world system, including the system’s origin and center – Western Europe and North America. ¶ The “discovery” of America and the genocide of Indians and African slaves are the very foundations of “modernity,” more so than the French or Industrial Revolutions. Better yet, they constitute the darker and hidden face of modernity, “coloniality.” Thus, to excavate the “idea of Latin America” is, really to understand how the West was born and how the modern world order was founded.
