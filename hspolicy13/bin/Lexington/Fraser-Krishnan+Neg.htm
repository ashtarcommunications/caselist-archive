Incentives come from secure property rights, and the incentive to innovate comes from secure intellectual property rights (IPR). When IPR is weak, the incentive to innovate weakens.<br/>This is crucial because America’s comparative advantage is in innovation. Our comparative advantage is expressed in export of technology goods, focused on computing but also including medical and other advanced equipment. Innovation makes competitive a wide range of American services, from education to entertainment. This is true for U.S. trade with all countries.<br/>The China angle: It is universally accepted that Chinese IPR protection in China is inadequate.~1~ This reduces incentives for American individuals and firms to innovate in goods and services trade with the PRC. Beijing expects the U.S. to respect China’s comparative advantage in assembly of consumer goods.

In recent years, several notable OFAC regulations and restrictions have been eased. This is at least partially due to long-time dictator Fidel Castro stepping down and ceding power to his brother Raul, who has implemented some market-based reforms. Although the guidelines are currently being updated by the Office of Foreign Assets control, travel restrictions and remittances between family members in the United States and relatives in Cuba are slowly becoming less onerous. In 2011, the allowances were extended to include exceptions for educational, religious, and journalism-related travel. This gives greater leeway to individuals, organizations, and businesses, although most commercial activity is still limited and requires an OFAC license.</p><p>2NC:</p><h2 id="HMultilat" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Multilat</span></h2><h4 id="HMultilatempiricallyfails2013ArabSpringprovesinterventionisminevitable" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Multilat empirically fails – Arab Spring proves interventionism inevitable</span></h4><p><strong>Rothkopf 3/10</strong> (David, visiting scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and President and CEO of Garten Rothkopf, 2011, and#34;Libya is a crucial test for Obama the multilateralistand#34;, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://rothkopf.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2011/03/10/libya_is_a_crucial_test_for_obama_the_multilateralist)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://rothkopf.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2011/03/10/libya_is_a_crucial_test_for_obama_the_multilateralist)%27" tppabs="http://rothkopf.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2011/03/10/libya_is_a_crucial_test_for_obama_the_multilateralist)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://rothkopf.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2011/03/10/libya_is_a_crucial_test_for_obama_the_multilateralist)</span></a></span></p><p>History has shown that there are some real obstacles to making multilateralism work.

People literally danced around the guillotines. &nbsp;Various military and civil commanders openly and officially boasted about their bestial deeds, which in all their sick horror were perpetrated above all against the and#34;internal enemyand#34;.<br/>Kuehnell-Leddihn relates from the available historical record of the French Revolution graphic descriptions of macabre atrocities and of campaigns to exterminate entire populations in the name of the revolution. In his words: ’Mass murder had become the order of the day in France’.<br/>Further on he draws a telling comparison between the French Revolution and those that followed in the 20th Century:<br/>’The picture painted by dogmatic socialism in action is strikingly similar to that of <br/>AND<br/>political thinking, and turmoil in the countryside accompanied by arson and robbery’.<br/>At least since Marx and Engels, if not before. Leftists have explained their revolutions in terms of class struggle, and have postured themselves as devoted champions of the noble cause of the working class. In the above quotation Kuehnell-Leddihn reminds us that the coercive Utopians and the simply opportunistic criminal rogues who led the revolutions came from every social and economic class.<br/>~Continues…~<br/>George Watson, a historian of the modern era who is presently engaged in writing <br/>AND<br/>to be Leftists from birth, and b) those that do not.<br/>That explains why some individuals are attracted to Leftism, seem so mesmerized by it, while others dislike it in some cases instinctively abhor it.<br/>The above theory sounds preposterous, to say the least.

None from the BRICS group — Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa — are part of the TPP. And while the countries negotiating the TPP are all members of APEC, some major APEC economies — in particular the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Indonesia, Russia and Thailand — are not included in the negotiations.<br/>China’s exclusion is strange given its huge economic presence in the Asia Pacific. This has given rise to views that the US is driving the TPP with the strategic objective of marginalising China.<br/>Another concern with the TPP is its impact on Asian integration. Various models of <br/>AND<br/>in Asia and force Asian economies to develop different strategies for regional integration.<br/>The complications created by the TPP are becoming visible in Asia. Japan and the ROK, while expressing interest in the TPP, are also negotiating the EAFTA. The dilemma of choosing between the TPP and other Asian trade frameworks will affect more Asian economies.<br/>Emerging markets like China, Brazil and India will find it difficult to join the <br/>AND<br/>strategically balance global trade, which could otherwise be dominated by the TPP.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HChinacannotjointheTPP" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>China cannot join the TPP</span></h4><p>Kissinger 12 - HENRY A.

Most of these remarkable documents were burned by European colonials as they propagated Christianity and scientific rationalism. The few that remain have been renamed after the Europeans who "discovered" them. Bequeathed to museums and libraries, they are now preserved as curious emblems of extinct civilizations.<br/>To symbolically counteract this appropriation, displacement and neutralization of indigenous culture in the Americas<br/>AND<br/>for a single codex to speak for all members of a unified society.<br/>A justified attempt to counteract five centuries of exploitation, domination and oppression, "The Chicano Codices" lacks verve, vitality and conviction. Instead, it merely repeats standard conceptions about the contemporary relationship between art and social identity.<br/>As objects of art, the modern codices represent nothing more—and nothing less—than the deep-seated opinions and heartfelt experiences of individual personalities. Titling these highly subjective and sometimes extremely personal paintings, sculptures and assemblages after authoritative manuscripts, which once embodied widely shared laws and social codes, erroneously suggests that an eradicated tradition can be instantaneously remade, whenever an artist enters the studio and invokes the past.<br/>Chicano art often strives to represent knowledge shared by a community, but the individualism represented in these codices would seem to be at cross-purposes with that aspiration. Emphatic individualism is a modern trait, embodied in much 20th-Century European art; usually, though, it has proven to be a poor substitute for the cohesive qualities of religion and myth, social history and political education.</p><h4 id="HTurnstheentiretyofthecase2013homogenizingLatinAmericajustifiesimperialism" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Turns the entirety of the case – homogenizing Latin America justifies imperialism</span></h4><p>Donald J. <strong>Mabry</strong>, 10-15-20<strong>09</strong>, Professor of History @ Mississippi State University, and The Historical Text Archive, "Colonial Latin America," <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://historicaltextarchive.com/latin/colonial.pdf  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://historicaltextarchive.com/latin/colonial.pdf%27" tppabs="http://historicaltextarchive.com/latin/colonial.pdf"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://historicaltextarchive.com/latin/colonial.pdf</span></a></span></p><p>Colonial Latin America, which lasted for about 300 years for most of the region<br/>AND<br/>look very hard in this part of the world to find other examples.</p><h4 id="HNoriskofendlesswarfare" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>No risk of endless warfare</span></h4><p><strong>Gray 7</strong>—Director of the Centre for Strategic Studies and Professor of International Relations and Strategic Studies at the University of Reading, graduate of the Universities of Manchester and Oxford, Founder and Senior Associate to the National Institute for Public Policy, formerly with the International Institute for Strategic Studies and the Hudson Institute (Colin, July, "The Implications of Preemptive and Preventive War Doctrines: A Reconsideration", <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.ciaonet.org/wps/ssi10561/ssi10561.pdf)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.ciaonet.org/wps/ssi10561/ssi10561.pdf)%27" tppabs="http://www.ciaonet.org/wps/ssi10561/ssi10561.pdf)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.ciaonet.org/wps/ssi10561/ssi10561.pdf)</span></a></span><br/>7.

"This (potential collaboration) is certainly something we will want to look at."<br/>San Antonio has leveraged health care and the biosciences into a 2425 billion industry annually. But local stakeholders are convinced that the Alamo City can build on that success by expanding its reach internationally. Mexico may be the perfect gateway to that growth because of the economic and cultural ties that exist between San Antonio and the world’s second-largest Latin-American country.<br/>A new health report from GlobalData projects that the economic impact of Mexico’s pharmaceutical market is expected to approach 2423 billion by 2020. The Rockville, Md.-based research firm says that sector was valued at a little over 248 billion as recently as 2005.<br/>Mexico has seen significant growth in its medical device sector, as well. The economic impact from that market was just over 243 billion in 2011, according to the GlobalData report. It’s projected to nearly double by the end of the decade.<br/>Plenty of incentive<br/>Some U.S. cities have taken note of Mexico’s growing bioscience industry.<br/>Officials in San Diego, for example, have been aggressive in attempting to seek out opportunities with Mexicans. The San Diego Dialogue, a program tied to the University of California at San Diego, launched a Life Sciences Gateway Initiative a few years ago. The focus of that partnership has been to identify and build relationships between the bioscience communities in California and Mexico.<br/>San Diego may have a head start on San Antonio when it comes to potential collaboration with Mexico in the bioscience arena. But Alamo City officials believe South Texas has some advantages over California.<br/>"San Diego has its place," Marquez says. "But San Antonio is connected to Mexico’s heartland by substantial infrastructure."<br/>BioMed SA President Ann Stevens says San Antonio officials have had conversations with Mexican leaders in the past about health care and the biosciences.<br/>"Some relationships have been formed," she says. "Some foundation has been laid. But the conversations have been somewhat broad."</p><h4 id="HNoimpacttodisease2013theyeitherburnoutordon2019tspread-2" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>No impact to disease – they either burn out or don’t spread</span></h4><p><strong>Posner 05</strong> – Senior Lecturer at University of Chicago (Richard A, "Catastrophe: the dozen most significant catastrophic risks and what we can do about them.", Winter, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_kmske/is_3_11/ai_n29167514/pg_2?tag=content;col1)//WL  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_kmske/is_3_11/ai_n29167514/pg_2?tag=content;col1)//WL%27" tppabs="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_kmske/is_3_11/ai_n29167514/pg_2?tag=content;col1)//WL"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_kmske/is_3_11/ai_n29167514/pg_2?tag=content;col1)//WL</span></a></span></p><p>Yet the fact that Homo sapiens has managed to survive every disease to assail it <br/>AND<br/>lesson of the AIDS pandemic.

Incentives come from secure property rights, and the incentive to innovate comes from secure intellectual property rights (IPR). When IPR is weak, the incentive to innovate weakens.<br/>This is crucial because America’s comparative advantage is in innovation. Our comparative advantage is expressed in export of technology goods, focused on computing but also including medical and other advanced equipment. Innovation makes competitive a wide range of American services, from education to entertainment. This is true for U.S. trade with all countries.<br/>The China angle: It is universally accepted that Chinese IPR protection in China is inadequate.~1~ This reduces incentives for American individuals and firms to innovate in goods and services trade with the PRC. Beijing expects the U.S. to respect China’s comparative advantage in assembly of consumer goods. In contrast, the American comparative advantage in IPR will be respected at some point in the future.<br/>A standing Chinese complaint is that the U.S. restricts technology exports to <br/>AND<br/>volumes consistent with combined Sino–American GDP of over 2422 trillion.</p><h4 id="HChina2019smilitarycan2019tcatchupandnoriskofwar-2" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>China’s military can’t catch up and no risk of war</span></h4><p>Zenko and Cohen 12 (Micah Zenko, Fellow in the Center for Preventive Action <br/>AND<br/>yale.edu/content/clear-and-present-safety)<br/>As the threat from transnational terrorist groups dwindles, the United States also faces few <br/>AND<br/>Beijing will continue to prefer a strong United States to a weak one.</p><h4 id="HResourceconstraintsandcredibilityconcernsdeterconflict-2" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Resource constraints and credibility concerns deter conflict</span></h4><p><strong>Diaz, 4/23</strong> – Writer for the Global Balita (Perry, "Why China Won’t Go to War VS US", Global Balita, April 23, 2013, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://globalbalita.com/2013/04/23/why-china-wouldnt-go-to-war-vs-u-s/)//VP  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://globalbalita.com/2013/04/23/why-china-wouldnt-go-to-war-vs-u-s/)//VP%27" tppabs="http://globalbalita.com/2013/04/23/why-china-wouldnt-go-to-war-vs-u-s/)//VP"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://globalbalita.com/2013/04/23/why-china-wouldnt-go-to-war-vs-u-s/)//VP</span></a></span></p><p>If China attacked the United States, she had better knock her out in the <br/>AND<br/>behavior would hurt her image and credibility for a long time to come.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h4 id="HEconomicinterdependencesolves-1" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Economic interdependence solves</span></h4><p><strong>Garrett, 13</strong> – Dean of the University of Sydney Business School and a professor of politics at the United States Studies Centre (Geoff, "No Cold War- US Will Ensure China Follows the ’Road Rules’", November 13, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-opinion/no-cold-war  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-opinion/no-cold-war%27" tppabs="http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-opinion/no-cold-war"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-opinion/no-cold-war</span></a></span>—us-will-ensure-china-follows-the-road-rules-20121112-298f1.html)<em>VP&nbsp;</em></p><p>Of course, like the rest of the world, the US’s economic future depends <br/>AND<br/>talked about in his speech to the Australian Parliament almost a year ago.</p></div></div></td><td>10/25/13</td></tr><tr><td style="width:100%; word-break:break-all; word-break:break-word;"><div><p><input onclick="saveEntry(40)" src="../../xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" tppabs="http://hspolicy13.debatecoaches.org/xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" style="float:right;" title="Save" type="image" value="Save"></input>

Susan Davis, part of San Diego’s congressional delegation who has championed the funding, said she doesn’t feel comfortable making promises.<br/>"We know that no matter where we try and push it in the budget we have a lot of people who don’t want to move in the direction of investment that supports the economy right now," Davis told Voice of San Diego.<br/>Davis and other advocates are cautiously optimistic.<br/>They’re grateful the Obama administration identified the funds but if Congress once again fails to pass a budget, the funding is history.<br/>That’s significant because Congress hasn’t passed a budget since 2009. Instead, it’s relied on continuing resolutions — legislative tools that allow lawmakers to simply extend the previous year’s budget.<br/>Continuing resolutions don’t incorporate construction projects, meaning such a move would keep San Ysidro funding off the nation’s balance sheet for next year.<br/>Funding for improved border infrastructure in Calexico, Calif., fell prey to a continuing resolution in 2011.<br/>The Senate allocated 2484.4 million for the area’s west port of entry but Congress never produced a bill.<br/>Last December, the Imperial Valley Press reported that Imperial County is now negotiating with California Power Corp., which may be willing to bankroll the border crossing upgrades. This is the county’s backup plan for the Calexico crossing should federal leaders fail to allocate funds anytime soon.<br/>If there isn’t a continuing resolution, the funds are more likely to survive but there’s still a chance they could be nixed in a bid to lower the nation’s deficit, or in a budget compromise.<br/>That’s why even the San Ysidro project’s strongest advocates aren’t convinced it will get started anytime soon.<br/>"I think being in the president’s budget is a very positive sign but whether it will make it through the budget or not, I don’t know," said Paul Ganster, director of San Diego State University’s Institute for Regional Studies of the Californias.<br/>Ganster, who has long pushed San Diego leaders to collaborate more with their Baja California counterparts, said the full backing of the region’s full congressional delegation will be key.<br/>City Councilman David Alvarez, whose district includes San Ysidro, agreed.<br/>"If we don’t have our own delegation from our own backyard advocating in support of this, it’s going to be hard to persuade 430 members of Congress to do the same," Alvarez said.</p><h4 id="HSustainingapermanentIrandealiskey2013itskeytosolveIranprolifandrealconcessions" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Sustaining a permanent Iran deal is key – its key to solve Iran prolif and real concessions</span></h4><p>Golnaz <strong>Esfandiari 11/24</strong>/13, writer @ Radio Free Europe citing Karim Sadjadpour, an Iran expert @ the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, and Ali Vaez, senior Iran analyst @ the International Crisis Group, "Road To Permanent Iran Deal Is Long, Time Is Short," <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.rferl.org/content/iran-nuclear-deal-analysis-us-obama-eu/25178532.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.rferl.org/content/iran-nuclear-deal-analysis-us-obama-eu/25178532.html%27" tppabs="http://www.rferl.org/content/iran-nuclear-deal-analysis-us-obama-eu/25178532.html"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.rferl.org/content/iran-nuclear-deal-analysis-us-obama-eu/25178532.html</span></a></span><br/>...Or Building Block?¶ ¶ But at the end of the day, says <br/>AND<br/>Arak project, long-term ~International Atomic Energy Agency~ verification."</p><h4 id="HNuclearwar-1" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Nuclear war</span></h4><p>Jeffrey <strong>Goldberg 12</strong>, Bloomberg View columnist and a national correspondent for the Atlantic, January 23, 2012, "How Iran Could Trigger Accidental Armageddon," online: <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-24/how-iran-may-trigger-accidental-armageddon-commentary-by-jeffrey-goldberg.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-24/how-iran-may-trigger-accidental-armageddon-commentary-by-jeffrey-goldberg.html%27" tppabs="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-24/how-iran-may-trigger-accidental-armageddon-commentary-by-jeffrey-goldberg.html"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-24/how-iran-may-trigger-accidental-armageddon-commentary-by-jeffrey-goldberg.html</span></a></span><br/>The experts who study this depressing issue seem to agree that a Middle East in <br/>AND<br/>must be stopped before it reaches fruition with a nuclear weapons delivery capability."</p></div></div></td><td>2/9/14</td></tr><tr><td style="width:100%; word-break:break-all; word-break:break-word;"><div><p><input onclick="saveEntry(52)" src="../../xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" tppabs="http://hspolicy13.debatecoaches.org/xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" style="float:right;" title="Save" type="image" value="Save"></input>

In this scenario, public life will be at the mercy of market forces, as the extracted profits benefit the few, writes Rajesh Makwana.<br/>The thrust of international policy behind the phenomenon of economic globalization is neoliberal in nature. Being hugely profitable to corporations and the wealthy elite, neoliberal polices are propagated through the IMF, World Bank and WTO. Neoliberalism favours the free-market as the most efficient method of global resource allocation. Consequently it favours large-scale, corporate commerce and the privatization of resources.<br/>There has been much international attention recently on neoliberalism. Its ideologies have been rejected by influential countries in Latin America and its moral basis is now widely questioned. Recent protests against the WTO, IMF and World Bank were essentially protests against the neoliberal policies that these organizations implement, particularly in low-income countries.<br/>The neoliberal experiment has failed to combat extreme poverty, has exacerbated global inequality, and is hampering international aid and development efforts. This article presents an overview of neoliberalism and its effect on low income countries.<br/>Introduction <br/>After the Second World War, corporate enterprises helped to create a wealthy class in society which enjoyed excessive political influence on their government in the US and Europe. Neoliberalism surfaced as a reaction by these wealthy elites to counteract post-war policies that favoured the working class and strengthened the welfare state.<br/>Neoliberal policies advocate market forces and commercial activity as the most efficient methods for producing <br/>AND<br/>corporations and affluent countries to secure their financial advantage within the world economy.<br/>The policies were most ardently enforced in the US and Europe in the1980s during the <br/>AND<br/>, economic and political leverage, they continue to further their neoliberal objectives.<br/>There is a consensus between the financial elite, neoclassical economists and the political classes <br/>AND<br/>the most likely means of reducing poverty and inequality in the poorest regions.<br/>There is a huge discrepancy between the measurable result of economic globalization and its proposed <br/>AND<br/>economic growth per capita grew to over 8 between 1980 and 2000.)<br/>Neoliberalism has also been unable to address growing levels of global inequality. Over the last 25 years, the income inequalities have increased dramatically, both within and between countries. Between 1980 and 1998, the income of richest 10 as share of poorest 10 became 19 more unequal; and the income of richest 1 as share of poorest 1 became 77 more unequal (again, not including China).<br/>The shortcomings of neoliberal policy are also apparent in the well documented economic disasters suffered <br/>AND<br/>and medical expertise throughout the region and with other countries around the world.<br/>The dramatic economic and social improvement seen in these countries has not stopped them from <br/>AND<br/>economic dominance has been and continues to be the USA’s main economic objective.<br/>According to Maria Páez Victor:<br/>and#34;Since 1846 the United States has carried out no fewer than 50 military invasions and destabilizing operations involving 12 different Latin American countries. Yet, none of these countries has ever had the capacity to threaten US security in any significant way. &nbsp;The US intervened because of perceived threats to its economic control and expansion. &nbsp;For this reason it has also supported some of the region’s most vicious dictators such as Batista, Somoza, Trujillo, and Pinochet.and#34;<br/>As a result of corporate and US influence, the key international bodies that developing <br/>AND<br/>project contracts. They all gain considerably from the neo-liberal model.<br/>So influential are corporations at this time that many of the worst violators of human rights have even entered a Global Compact with the United Nations, the world’s foremost humanitarian body. Due to this international convergence of economic ideology, it is no coincidence that the assumptions that are key to increasing corporate welfare and growth are the same assumptions that form the thrust of mainstream global economic policy.<br/>However, there are huge differences between the neoliberal dogma that the US and EU <br/>AND<br/>to achieving development by imposing an ideology that suits their own economic needs.<br/>The US and EU also provide huge subsidies to many sectors of industry. These devastate small industries in developing countries, particularly farmers who cannot compete with the price of subsidized goods in international markets. Despite their neoliberal rhetoric, most ’capitalist’ countries have increased their levels of state intervention over the past 25 years, and the size of their government has increased. The requirement is to ’do as I say, not as I do’.<br/>Given the tiny proportion of individuals that benefit from neoliberal policies, the chasm between what is good for the economy and what serves the public good is growing fast. Decisions to follow these policies are out of the hands of the public, and the national sovereignty of many developing countries continues to be violated, preventing them from prioritizing urgent national needs.<br/>Below we examine the false assumptions of neoliberal policies and their effect on the global economy.<br/>Economic Growth<br/>Economic growth, as measured in GDP, is the yardstick of economic globalization which <br/>AND<br/>economic growth is the only way to prosper a country and reduce poverty.<br/>Logically, however, a model for continual financial growth is unsustainable. Corporations have to go to extraordinary lengths in order to reflect endless growth in their accounting books. As a result, finite resources are wasted and the environment is dangerously neglected. The equivalent of two football fields of natural forest is cleared each second by profit hungry corporations.<br/>Economic growth is also used by the World Bank and government economists to measure progress <br/>AND<br/>growth have proved impossible due to the inadequacy of the statistical measures employed.<br/>The mandate for economic growth is the perfect platform for corporations which, as a result, have grown rapidly in their economic activity, profitability and political influence. Yet this very model is also the cause of the growing inequalities seen across the globe. The privatization of resources and profits by the few at the expense of the many, and the inability of the poorest people to afford market prices, are both likely causes.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HRejectneoliberalismtoembraceCubanalismo2013endorsingCuba2019seconomicmodeliskeytodemonstratethatalternativesexistoutsidedominantWesternideology" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Reject neoliberalism to embrace Cubanalismo – endorsing Cuba’s economic model is key to demonstrate that alternatives exist outside dominant Western ideology</span></h4><p><strong>Fanelli 8&nbsp;</strong>(Carlo Fanelli, Department of Sociology, York University, November 2008, and#34;’Cubanalismo’: The Cuban Alternative to Neoliberalismand#34;, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27https://mail-attachment.googleusercontent.com/attachment/u/0/?ui=226ik=ca602910b826view=att26th=1402883ba36493ee26attid=0.126disp=inline26realattid=f_hjp4psz2026safe=126zw26saduie=AG9B_P_TyPHIjOArXXGZNtwjo8L526sadet=137538208314226sads=e9iC4I3SMN1yjSDGkdM0Hnivuwo)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed using an unsupported protocol (e.g., gopher).  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27https://mail-attachment.googleusercontent.com/attachment/u/0/?ui=226ik=ca602910b826view=att26th=1402883ba36493ee26attid=0.126disp=inline26realattid=f_hjp4psz2026safe=126zw26saduie=AG9B_P_TyPHIjOArXXGZNtwjo8L526sadet=137538208314226sads=e9iC4I3SMN1yjSDGkdM0Hnivuwo)%27" tppabs="https://mail-attachment.googleusercontent.com/attachment/u/0/?ui=226ik=ca602910b826view=att26th=1402883ba36493ee26attid=0.126disp=inline26realattid=f_hjp4psz2026safe=126zw26saduie=AG9B_P_TyPHIjOArXXGZNtwjo8L526sadet=137538208314226sads=e9iC4I3SMN1yjSDGkdM0Hnivuwo)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">https://mail-attachment.googleusercontent.com/attachment/u/0/?ui=226ik=ca602910b826view=att26th=1402883ba36493ee26attid=0.126disp=inline26realattid=f_hjp4psz2026safe=126zw26saduie=AG9B_P_TyPHIjOArXXGZNtwjo8L526sadet=137538208314226sads=e9iC4I3SMN1yjSDGkdM0Hnivuwo)</span></a></span> <em>ZA</em></p><p>As this paper has attempted to integrate throughout this discussion, alternatives to neoliberalism do<br/>AND<br/>alternative modes of socioeconomic and environmental polices can and do continue to exist.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>2NC:</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HNeoliberalismisagenocidalimpulsethatleadstoextinction" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Neoliberalism is a genocidal impulse that leads to extinction</span></h4><p>Santos, sociology prof, 3 (Boaventura de Sousa, Professor of Sociology at the School of Economics, University of Coimbra (Portugal) and Distinguished Scholar at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Law School. and#34;Collective Suicide?and#34; March 28, 2003 online <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.ces.fe.uc.pt/opiniao/bss/072en.php)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.ces.fe.uc.pt/opiniao/bss/072en.php)%27" tppabs="http://www.ces.fe.uc.pt/opiniao/bss/072en.php)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.ces.fe.uc.pt/opiniao/bss/072en.php)</span></a></span></p><p>According to Franz Hinkelammert, the West has repeatedly been under the illusion that it <br/>AND<br/>machine of democracy and liberty turns into a machine of horror and destruction.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HNeoliberalismcooptsreform.PragmatismforLiatinAmericangovernmentsresultsincontrolbyinternationalcapital." class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Neoliberalism coopts reform.

Its joining ignited the accession of Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia, turning the idea about an entity comprising all 10 nations of Southeast Asia, by Southeast Asia and for Southeast Asia into reality.<br/>The joining of Vietnam in particular and the three countries in general changed the block’s nature and development orientation. Southeast Asia, which had suffered complex and hostile regional situations, became a region of friendship and cooperation. From an organization in the region, ASEAN advanced into the region’s organization.<br/>After the admission of Cambodia in ASEAN in April 1999 in Vietnam’s Hanoi capital, <br/>AND<br/>the world with a higher status and stronger voice in the international arena.<br/>Vietnam’s role in ASEAN has gone well so far, though it was cautious in <br/>AND<br/>Weapon-Free Zone (SEANWFZ) in the 2000-2001 periods.<br/>In other words, Vietnam participated in managing ASEAN and issuing policies for its development after five years of actively partaking in its activities. In the context of the Asian financial crisis in late 1990s, the 6th ASEAN Summit with the adoption of the Hanoi Declaration and the Hanoi Plan of Action (HPA) was of great significance.<br/>The six-year HPA is the first in a series of plans of actions <br/>AND<br/>helping recover the international community’s confidence in the block’s role and future development.<br/>It is Vietnam’s political and social stability and economic growth that have helped boost the <br/>AND<br/>, East Asia tourism cooperation, and the organization of ASEAN culture weeks.<br/>Vietnam has also contributed to the peace and stability in the region, helping turn <br/>AND<br/>Conduct in the South China Sea (COC) between ASEAN and China.<br/>Through its active participation in and contribution to ASEAN, Vietnam has gained stronger international acceptance, and wider access to added investment both from the region and the world. The nation’s joining in ASEAN has helped the country conduct its external policies effectively, enhanced its bilateral ties with regional countries, offered it opportunities to strengthen bilateral relations with ASEAN partners as well as other non-block members such as the European Union (EU), Canada and Australia.<br/>Specifically, Vietnam’s involvement in ASEAN’s economic cooperation programs and partnerships such as the ASEAN <br/>AND<br/>to advanced technologies via cooperation programs with countries inside and outside the region.<br/>Notably, trade between Vietnam and ASEAN countries sees average annual growth of 26.8 percent, and accounts for one-third of the country’s total imports and exports. The two-way trade stood at 5. 2 billion US dollars in 1996, up 525.9 percent against 1990. By early 2004, total investment of ASEAN in Vietnam was 9.5 billion dollars, representing 20 percent of combined foreign investment in the country.<br/>Cooperation between Vietnam and ASEAN in all fields, especially economy, trade and investment is expected to bear more fruits in the coming time. Vietnam with a current population of 82 million has seen rapid economic development in recent years, recording a 7. 24-percent growth in gross domestic product (GDP) which stood at 38.8 billion dollars last year.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HVietnamesecollapsecausesAsianEconomiccollapse2013theeconomiesareintertwined" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Vietnamese collapse causes Asian Economic collapse – the economies are intertwined</span></h4><p><strong>WEF 12</strong> (World Economic Forum, Cochairs: Pailin Chuchottaworn, President and Chief Executive Officer of PTT Public Company in Thailand, Helene D.

That is because the US squanders perhaps 10 to 20 times what is needed for a good, affordable medical system. The waste is far more than the 30 overhead by private insurance companies. It includes an enormous amount of over-treatment, making the poor sicker by refusing them treatment, exorbitant over-pricing of medications and medical procedures, creation of illnesses, exposure to contagion through over-hospitalisation, and disease-focused instead of prevention-focused research.~1~ Poor countries simply cannot afford such a health system. Well over 100 countries are looking to the example of Cuba, which has the same 78-year life expectancy of the US while spending 4 per person annually of what the US does.~2~ The most revolutionary idea of the Cuban system is doctors living in the neighbourhoods they serve. A doctor-nurse team is part of the community and know their patients well because they live at (or near) the consultorio (doctors’ office) where they work. Consultorios are backed up by policlínicos which provide services during off-hours and offer a wide variety of specialists. Policlínicos coordinate community health delivery and link nationally designed health initiatives with their local implementation. Cubans call their system medicina general integral (MGI, comprehensive general medicine). Its programs focus on preventing people from getting diseases and treating them as rapidly as possible. The MGI integration of neighbourhood doctors’ offices with area clinics and a national hospital system also means the country responds well to emergencies. It has the ability to evacuate entire cities during a hurricane largely because consultorio staff know everyone in their neighbourhood and know who to call for help getting disabled residents out of harm’s way. New York City (roughly the same population as Cuba) had 43,000 cases of AIDS, Cuba had 200 AIDS patients.~5~ More recent emergencies such as outbreaks of dengue fever are quickly followed by national mobilisations.~6~ Perhaps the most amazing aspect of Cuban medicine it that, despite its being a poor country itself, Cuba has sent more than 124,000 health-care professionals to provide care to 154 countries.~7~ In addition to providing preventive medicine Cuba sends response teams following emergencies (such as earthquakes and hurricanes) and has more than 20,000 students from other countries studying to be doctors at its Latin American School of Medicine in Havana (ELAM, Escuela Latinoamericana de Medicina).~8~ In a recent Links International Journal of Socialist Renewal article, I gave in-depth descriptions of ELAM students participating in Cuban medical efforts in Haiti, Ghana and Peru.~9, see also <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://links.org.au/node/1984~~  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://links.org.au/node/1984~~%27" tppabs="http://links.org.au/node/1984~~"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://links.org.au/node/1984~~</span></a></span> What follows are 10 generalisations from Cuba’s extensive experience in developing medical science and sharing its approach with poor countries throughout the world. The concepts form the basis of the new global medicine and summarise what many authors have observed in dozens of articles and books. First, it is not necessary to focus on expensive technology as the initial approach to medical care. Cuban doctors use machines that are available, but they have an amazing ability to treat disaster victims with field surgery. They are very aware that most lives are saved through preventive medicine such as nutrition and hygiene and that traditional cultures have their own healing wisdom. This is in direct contrast to Western medicine, especially as is dominant in the US, which uses costly diagnostic and treatment techniques as the first approach and is contemptuous of natural and alternative approaches. Second, doctors must be part of the communities where they are working. This could mean living in the same neighbourhood as a Peruvian consultorio. It could mean living in a Venezuelan community that is much more violent than a Cuban one. Or it could mean living in emergency tents adjacent to where victims are housed as Cuban medical brigades did after the 2010 earthquake in Haiti. Or it could mean staying in a village guesthouse in Ghana. Cuba-trained doctors know their patients by knowing their patients’ communities. This differs sharply from US doctors, who receive zero training on how to assess homes of their patients. Third, the MGI model outlines relationships between people that go beyond a set of facts. Instead of memorising mountains of information unlikely to be used in community health, which US students must do to pass medical board exams, Cuban students learn what is necessary to relate to people in consultorios, polyclínicos, field hospitals and remote villages. Far from being nuisance courses, studies in how people are bio-psycho-social beings are critical for the everyday practice of Cuban medicine. Fourth, the MGI model is not static but is evolving and unique for each community. Western medicine searches for the correct pill for a given disease. In its rigid approach, a major reason for research is to discover a new pill after "side effects" of the first pill surface. Since traditional medicine is based on the culture where it has existed for centuries, the MGI model avoids the futility of seeking to impose a Western mindset on other societies. Fifth, it is necessary to adapt medical aid to the political climate of the host country. This means using whatever resources the host government is able and willing to offer and living with restrictions. Those hosting a Cuban medical brigade may be friendly as in Venezuela and Ghana, hostile as is the Brazilian Medical Association, become increasingly hostile as occurred after the 2009 coup in Honduras, or change from hostile to friendly as occurred in Peru with the 2011 election of Ollanta Humala. This is quite different from US medical aid which, like its food aid, is part of an overall effort to dominate the receiving country and push it into adopting a Western model. Sixth, the MGI model creates the basis for dramatic health effects. Preventive community health training, a desire to understand traditional healers, the ability to respond quickly to emergencies, and an appreciation of political limitations give Cuban medical teams astounding success. During the first 18 months of Cuba’s work in Honduras following Hurricane Mitch, infant mortality dropped from 80.3 to 30.9 per 1000 live births. When Cuban health professionals intervened in Gambia, malaria decreased from 600,000 cases in 2002 to 200,000 two years later. And Cuban/Venezuelan collaboration resulted in 1.5 million vision corrections by 2009. Kirk and Erisman conclude that "almost 2 million people throughout the world … owe their very lives to the availability of Cuban medical services."~7~ Seventh, the new global medicine can become reality only if medical staff put healing above personal wealth. In Cuba, being a doctor, nurse or support staff and going on a mission to another country is one of the most fulfilling activities a person can do. The program continues to find an increasing number of volunteers despite the low salaries that Cuban health professionals earn. There is definitely a minority of US doctors who focus their practice in low-income communities that have the greatest need. But there is no US political leadership which makes a concerted effort to get physicians to do anything other than follow the money. Eighth, dedication to the new global medicine is now being transferred to the next generation. When students at Cuban schools learn to be doctors, dentists or nurses their instructors tell them of their own participation in health brigades in Angola, Peru, Haiti, Honduras and dozens of other countries. Venezuela has already developed its own approach of MIC (medicina integral communitaria, comprehensive community medicine), which builds upon, but is distinct from, Cuban MGI.~10~ Many ELAM students who work in Ghana as the Yaa Asantewaa Brigade are from the US. They learn approaches of traditional healers so they can compliment Ghanaian techniques with Cuban medical knowledge. Ninth, the Cuban model is remaking medicine across the globe. Though best known for its successes in Latin America, Africa and the Caribbean, Cuba has also provided assistance in Asia and the Pacific islands. Cuba provided relief to the Ukraine after the 1986 Chernobyl meltdown, Sri Lanka following the 2004 tsunami and Pakistan after its 2005 earthquake. Many of the countries hosting Cuban medical brigades are eager for them to help redesign their own health-care systems. Rather than attempting to make expensive Western techniques available to everyone, the Cuban MGI model helps re-conceptualise how healing systems can meet the needs of a country’s poor. Tenth, the new global medicine is a microcosm of how a few thousand revolutionaries can change the world. They do not need vast riches, expensive technology or a massive increase in personal possessions to improve the quality of people’s lives. If dedicated to helping people while learning from those they help, they can prefigure a new world by carefully utilising the resources in front of them. Such revolutionary activity helps show a world facing acute climate change that it can resolve many basic human needs without pouring more CO2 into the atmosphere. Discussions of global health in the West typically bemoan the indisputable fact that poor countries still suffer from chronic and infectious diseases that rich countries have controlled for decades. International health organisations wring their hands over the high infant mortality rates and lack of resources to cope with natural disasters in much of the world. But they ignore the one health system that actually functions in a poor country, providing health care to all of its citizens as well as millions of others around the world. The conspiracy of silence surrounding the resounding success of Cuba’s health system proves the unconcern by those who piously claim to be the most concerned.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h3 id="H1nc-2" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>1nc</span></h3><h4 id="HWeagreewiththeentiretyofthe1ACexceptwerejecttheiraffirmationoftheresolution" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>We agree with the entirety of the 1AC except we reject their affirmation of the resolution</span></h4><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="H1-Theaff2019scallforeconomicengagementmodernizationisnotneutral2014itjustifiesthedemarcationofpopulationsasdestructibleandhidesendlessinvisibledeaths2014it2019syourobligationtobringthesetotheforefrontofyourdecisioncalculus" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>1 - The aff’s call for economic engagement modernization is not neutral—it justifies the demarcation of populations as destructible and hides endless invisible deaths—it’s your obligation to bring these to the forefront of your decision calculus</span></h4><p>Mignolo 7 (Walter, Argentinian semiotician 26 Duke professor, "The De-Colonial Option and the Meaning of Identity in Politics", Anales N.

They are reportedly vetting and nailing down language and preparing the package for mark-up when the Senate returns. A deal appears close to being done, and it’s looking more like the House’s Innovation Act, which bodes well for final passage.<br/>Yet time is of the essence as the clock is ticking on this Congress. <br/>AND<br/>when innovation is such a critical driver of economic growth and global competitiveness.<br/>Recognizing that patent trolls leverage the high risk and high cost of litigation to extract nuisance settlements, the House passed the Innovation Act by a lopsided 325-91 margin in December.<br/>As the Senate Judiciary committee struggles to come to terms on some thorny provisions, <br/>AND<br/>business method patents that should not have been issued in the first place.<br/>Current law and practice stack the deck in favor of trolls, who typically send <br/>AND<br/>a fledgling business which can ill afford the cost or distraction of litigation.<br/>To stem this tide, the committee should press ahead to finalize a package that will redress the existing imbalances in the patent litigation system. The bill must include provisions for:<br/>• Transparency of ownership post-issuance and throughout the life of the patent.<br/>• Specificity in demand letters.<br/>• Heightened pleading standards that require the identification of claims asserted to be infringed. Any bona fide claim of infringement should be able to meet these reasonable standards, which even provide an exception in cases where the plaintiff is unable to access all the information.<br/>• Capping discovery costs by enabling the court to determine what the disputed patent covers and the scope of the claims before allowing broad-ranging, expensive, and potentially irrelevant discovery. This will prevent trolls from driving up costs in order to gain leverage in litigation.<br/>• End-of-case fee shifting in favor of a prevailing party while maintaining the court’s discretion to deny fee shifting if the losing party’s actions and conduct were objectively reasonable.<br/>• Provisions that enable the real party in interest to be held liable for any costs assigned to shell entities.<br/>To be sure, infringement is also a very real threat to inventors and startups, so the Senate should take care to ensure that nothing in the legislation prejudices the ability of patent holders to commercialize patents or assert legitimate claims. The proposals that have been reportedly agreed upon reflect a keen sensitivity to balancing these interests and the bipartisan negotiators should be commended for taking such care in walking that fine line.<br/>This legislation needs to be balanced but it also needs to be effective, so potential unintended consequences should not be exaggerated in an effort to water down or derail the bill. The bill, like any legislation, should be evaluated by its intended and likely effects, not by reference to potential consequences which are exceptional or unlikely.<br/>It is clear that the current state of affairs enables abuse and is tilted too <br/>AND<br/>hope the Senate seizes this chance to improve and strengthen the patent system.</p><p>Obama’s PC is key<br/>Lengell, 4/4/14 (Sean, Washington Examiner, "Lawmakers look to stop patent abuse", <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://washingtonexaminer.com/lawmakers-look-to-stop-patent-abuse/article/2546745)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://washingtonexaminer.com/lawmakers-look-to-stop-patent-abuse/article/2546745)%27" tppabs="http://washingtonexaminer.com/lawmakers-look-to-stop-patent-abuse/article/2546745)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://washingtonexaminer.com/lawmakers-look-to-stop-patent-abuse/article/2546745)</span></a></span></p><p>Momentum is building on Capitol Hill to stop "patent trolls" from harassing businesses and inventors, with optimism high that legislation will pass this year.<br/>With wide bipartisan support, the House has approved a patent reform bill aimed at stopping the so-called trolls — patent-holding companies that extract licensing fees or file infringement lawsuits that many executives complain are frivolous and cost legitimate companies millions of dollars.<br/>The Senate Judiciary Committee is considering its own bipartisan measure, with its members hopeful a bill will reach the full Senate for a vote as early as this spring.<br/>"Members on both sides of the aisle agree that abusive patent tactics hurt the ability of businesses to expand and flourish, and undermine the integrity of our patent system," said Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, the panel’s top Republican.<br/>With lawmakers in both parties and the White House on board — President Obama called for reform in his State of the Union address — patent reform legislation could be among the few significant bills passed this year.<br/>"The fact that there have been ongoing conversations since this process started ~last year~ between the two chambers and the White House I think is a positive sign of something actually happening this year," said Beth Provenzano, a lobbyist for the National Retail Federation, which is pushing for the legislation.</p><p><strong>====The plan kills PC====</strong><br/><strong>Halverstadt 13</strong> — Lisa Halverstadt, reporter at Voice of San Diego (Lisa Halverstadt, Voice of San Diego, 04-25-2013, "Waiting on Congress to Ease Border Waits", <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://voiceofsandiego.org/2013/04/25/waiting-on-congress-to-ease-border-waits/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://voiceofsandiego.org/2013/04/25/waiting-on-congress-to-ease-border-waits/%27" tppabs="http://voiceofsandiego.org/2013/04/25/waiting-on-congress-to-ease-border-waits/"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://voiceofsandiego.org/2013/04/25/waiting-on-congress-to-ease-border-waits/</span></a></span>, Accessed 08-01-2013 | AK)<br/> <br/>Funding to improve the world’s busiest land border crossing made it into President Barack Obama’s budget but that doesn’t mean the project will shorten lines at the San Ysidro port anytime soon.<br/>Some San Diego politicians and business leaders have spent years advocating for the completion of a three-phase project that would boost the crossings’ outdated infrastructure with 38 new inspection booths and realign Interstate 5 to match up with Mexico’s El Chaparral facility, among other fixes.<br/>The latest upgrade would create the new southbound connection to Mexico and add northbound inspection booths.<br/>But no one is certain the 24226 million the president included in his budget for the latest phase of the project will make its way to San Ysidro.<br/>The budget proposal must survive both the budget appropriations process and an ever-dysfunctional Congress, which hasn’t approved a formal budget since 2009.<br/>Rep. Susan Davis, part of San Diego’s congressional delegation who has championed the funding, said she doesn’t feel comfortable making promises.<br/>"We know that no matter where we try and push it in the budget we have a lot of people who don’t want to move in the direction of investment that supports the economy right now," Davis told Voice of San Diego.<br/>Davis and other advocates are cautiously optimistic.<br/>They’re grateful the Obama administration identified the funds but if Congress once again fails to pass a budget, the funding is history.<br/>That’s significant because Congress hasn’t passed a budget since 2009. Instead, it’s relied on continuing resolutions — legislative tools that allow lawmakers to simply extend the previous year’s budget.<br/>Continuing resolutions don’t incorporate construction projects, meaning such a move would keep San Ysidro funding off the nation’s balance sheet for next year.<br/>Funding for improved border infrastructure in Calexico, Calif., fell prey to a continuing resolution in 2011.<br/>The Senate allocated 2484.4 million for the area’s west port of entry but Congress never produced a bill.<br/>Last December, the Imperial Valley Press reported that Imperial County is now negotiating with California Power Corp., which may be willing to bankroll the border crossing upgrades. This is the county’s backup plan for the Calexico crossing should federal leaders fail to allocate funds anytime soon.<br/>If there isn’t a continuing resolution, the funds are more likely to survive but there’s still a chance they could be nixed in a bid to lower the nation’s deficit, or in a budget compromise.<br/>That’s why even the San Ysidro project’s strongest advocates aren’t convinced it will get started anytime soon.<br/>"I think being in the president’s budget is a very positive sign but whether it will make it through the budget or not, I don’t know," said Paul Ganster, director of San Diego State University’s Institute for Regional Studies of the Californias.<br/>Ganster, who has long pushed San Diego leaders to collaborate more with their Baja California counterparts, said the full backing of the region’s full congressional delegation will be key.<br/>City Councilman David Alvarez, whose district includes San Ysidro, agreed.<br/>"If we don’t have our own delegation from our own backyard advocating in support of this, it’s going to be hard to persuade 430 members of Congress to do the same," Alvarez said.</p><h4 id="Hsolvespatentreformsolvesresearchfunding-trollscrushit" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>solves patent reform solves research funding- trolls crush it</span></h4><p>Robin <strong>Feldman 3-28</strong>, professor of Law, Harry 26 Lillian Hastings Chair, and director of the Institute for Innovation Law at the University of California Hastings College of Law, 3/28/14, "Next patent troll victims: Pharma and bio?," <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/judicial/201945-next-patent-troll-victims-pharma-and-bio  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/judicial/201945-next-patent-troll-victims-pharma-and-bio%27" tppabs="http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/judicial/201945-next-patent-troll-victims-pharma-and-bio"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/judicial/201945-next-patent-troll-victims-pharma-and-bio</span></a></span><br/>With scattered signs showing that patent trolls are beginning to purchase biopharmaceutical patents, however, my co-author and I wondered whether the industry was really as safe as assumed. In particular, we wondered whether university holdings could provide a tempting pool of ammunition to launch against current biopharmaceutical products. <br/>To test that theory, we looked at the life science patent holdings of five major research universities: University of California, University of Texas, MIT, CalTech, and the University of South Florida. Our study identified dozens of patents that could be deployed against current bio and pharma industries, following the patterns that NPEs have used against other industries. These include patents on drug formulas, methods of treatments, research methods, dosage forms, and others. <br/>If patents like these are around and threatening, why hasn’t the biopharmaceutical industry found <br/>AND<br/>out and licensing every patent that could potentially be launched against a product. <br/>That safety net, however, may be coming down. Last fall, the Association of University Technology Managers began revisiting its policy against selling patents to NPEs. Pressure on university technology offices to bring in more revenue is causing the Association to rethink its position. That re-evaluation, however, could have serious consequences for the biopharmaceutical industry and for universities themselves. <br/>Many university patents are developed at least in part with federal funds, and there <br/>AND<br/>research is being used to harm American businesses with little return to innovation. <br/>As a result, dancing with NPEs could be a risky business for universities. If public anger about patent trolling focuses on universities, they have much more to lose in terms of federal dollars than they have to gain from NPEs. <br/>Concerns about university portfolios and patent trolling are particularly relevant as Congress considers reform proposals. Some of the proposals would exempt universities and those working with universities. It is critical for legislative drafters to understand the potential for problems within university portfolios in general and as they might be aimed at the life sciences in particular. <br/>The study is intended to sound a warning bell. Technology trolling seeped in silently under the radar, growing to extraordinary dimensions before lawmakers had time to react. In contrast, life sciences trolling is predictable and in its infancy. If reforms are implemented before the problem proliferates throughout the industry, legislators and regulators have a chance to cabin the activity before it becomes deeply entrenched and before too much harm occurs.</p><h4 id="Hthat2019skeytothenuclearcomplex" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>that’s key to the nuclear complex</span></h4><p>Warren <strong>Miller et al 7</strong>, Research Professor and Associate Director, Nuclear Security Science and Policy Institute, Texas A26M University, 1/18/7, "Nuclear’s Human Element," <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www2.ans.org/pi/fine/docs/finereport.pdf  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www2.ans.org/pi/fine/docs/finereport.pdf%27" tppabs="http://www2.ans.org/pi/fine/docs/finereport.pdf"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www2.ans.org/pi/fine/docs/finereport.pdf</span></a></span><br/>The situation in the world today is extremely complex as it relates to nuclear technology <br/>AND<br/>); and energy security concerns driving nations toward more diverse electricity production portfolios. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>At the same time, concerns about the potential malevolent use of nuclear technology have <br/>AND<br/>and people who are literate, trained, and educated in nuclear processes. <br/>The United States must have appropriate numbers of high?quality NSE graduates for the <br/>AND<br/>must serve as a steward for the national nuclear research and education enterprise. &nbsp;<br/>For the purposes of this study, NSE includes the disciplines of nuclear engineering, <br/>AND<br/>is based on fundamental areas related to the interaction of radiation with matter.<br/>THE DOE ROLE IN US NSE EDUCATION <br/>Although &nbsp;university?based &nbsp;NSE &nbsp;programs across the country receive support from various state and <br/>AND<br/>) interest in radiation effects on humans in space is a notable exception~. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>It is true that university?based NSE programs often conduct research that is only <br/>AND<br/>, and nuclear weapons design, is not available outside DOE/NE. &nbsp;<br/>DOE support of graduate programs in NSE is particularly important.

In this scenario, public life will be at the mercy of market forces, as the extracted profits benefit the few, writes Rajesh Makwana.<br/>The thrust of international policy behind the phenomenon of economic globalization is neoliberal in nature. Being hugely profitable to corporations and the wealthy elite, neoliberal polices are propagated through the IMF, World Bank and WTO. Neoliberalism favours the free-market as the most efficient method of global resource allocation. Consequently it favours large-scale, corporate commerce and the privatization of resources.<br/>There has been much international attention recently on neoliberalism. Its ideologies have been rejected by influential countries in Latin America and its moral basis is now widely questioned. Recent protests against the WTO, IMF and World Bank were essentially protests against the neoliberal policies that these organizations implement, particularly in low-income countries.<br/>The neoliberal experiment has failed to combat extreme poverty, has exacerbated global inequality, and is hampering international aid and development efforts. This article presents an overview of neoliberalism and its effect on low income countries.<br/>Introduction <br/>After the Second World War, corporate enterprises helped to create a wealthy class in society which enjoyed excessive political influence on their government in the US and Europe. Neoliberalism surfaced as a reaction by these wealthy elites to counteract post-war policies that favoured the working class and strengthened the welfare state.<br/>Neoliberal policies advocate market forces and commercial activity as the most efficient methods for producing <br/>AND<br/>corporations and affluent countries to secure their financial advantage within the world economy.<br/>The policies were most ardently enforced in the US and Europe in the1980s during the <br/>AND<br/>, economic and political leverage, they continue to further their neoliberal objectives.<br/>There is a consensus between the financial elite, neoclassical economists and the political classes <br/>AND<br/>the most likely means of reducing poverty and inequality in the poorest regions.<br/>There is a huge discrepancy between the measurable result of economic globalization and its proposed <br/>AND<br/>economic growth per capita grew to over 8 between 1980 and 2000.)<br/>Neoliberalism has also been unable to address growing levels of global inequality. Over the last 25 years, the income inequalities have increased dramatically, both within and between countries. Between 1980 and 1998, the income of richest 10 as share of poorest 10 became 19 more unequal; and the income of richest 1 as share of poorest 1 became 77 more unequal (again, not including China).<br/>The shortcomings of neoliberal policy are also apparent in the well documented economic disasters suffered <br/>AND<br/>and medical expertise throughout the region and with other countries around the world.<br/>The dramatic economic and social improvement seen in these countries has not stopped them from <br/>AND<br/>economic dominance has been and continues to be the USA’s main economic objective.<br/>According to Maria Páez Victor:<br/>"Since 1846 the United States has carried out no fewer than 50 military invasions and destabilizing operations involving 12 different Latin American countries. Yet, none of these countries has ever had the capacity to threaten US security in any significant way. &nbsp;The US intervened because of perceived threats to its economic control and expansion. &nbsp;For this reason it has also supported some of the region’s most vicious dictators such as Batista, Somoza, Trujillo, and Pinochet."<br/>As a result of corporate and US influence, the key international bodies that developing <br/>AND<br/>project contracts. They all gain considerably from the neo-liberal model.<br/>So influential are corporations at this time that many of the worst violators of human rights have even entered a Global Compact with the United Nations, the world’s foremost humanitarian body. Due to this international convergence of economic ideology, it is no coincidence that the assumptions that are key to increasing corporate welfare and growth are the same assumptions that form the thrust of mainstream global economic policy.<br/>However, there are huge differences between the neoliberal dogma that the US and EU <br/>AND<br/>to achieving development by imposing an ideology that suits their own economic needs.<br/>The US and EU also provide huge subsidies to many sectors of industry. These devastate small industries in developing countries, particularly farmers who cannot compete with the price of subsidized goods in international markets. Despite their neoliberal rhetoric, most ’capitalist’ countries have increased their levels of state intervention over the past 25 years, and the size of their government has increased. The requirement is to ’do as I say, not as I do’.<br/>Given the tiny proportion of individuals that benefit from neoliberal policies, the chasm between what is good for the economy and what serves the public good is growing fast. Decisions to follow these policies are out of the hands of the public, and the national sovereignty of many developing countries continues to be violated, preventing them from prioritizing urgent national needs.<br/>Below we examine the false assumptions of neoliberal policies and their effect on the global economy.<br/>Economic Growth<br/>Economic growth, as measured in GDP, is the yardstick of economic globalization which <br/>AND<br/>economic growth is the only way to prosper a country and reduce poverty.<br/>Logically, however, a model for continual financial growth is unsustainable. Corporations have to go to extraordinary lengths in order to reflect endless growth in their accounting books. As a result, finite resources are wasted and the environment is dangerously neglected. The equivalent of two football fields of natural forest is cleared each second by profit hungry corporations.<br/>Economic growth is also used by the World Bank and government economists to measure progress <br/>AND<br/>growth have proved impossible due to the inadequacy of the statistical measures employed.<br/>The mandate for economic growth is the perfect platform for corporations which, as a result, have grown rapidly in their economic activity, profitability and political influence. Yet this very model is also the cause of the growing inequalities seen across the globe. The privatization of resources and profits by the few at the expense of the many, and the inability of the poorest people to afford market prices, are both likely causes.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HOuralternativeistodecolonizeeconomicengagement.Questioningthepoliticsofspaceandknowledgethatmakeengagementaneconomictoolofmanipulationiskeytosustainabledevelopment.-1" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Our alternative is to decolonize economic engagement.

Just consider what’s in the pipeline now that could be used to protect Americans against infectious diseases, including bioterrorism. A Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Research Association survey found 137 new medicines for infectious diseases in drug company research and development pipelines, including 19 antibiotics and 42 vaccines.<br/>With regard to anthrax, instead of having to rush a sample to a lab where it takes hours or even days to culture, biotech companies have created test strips using antibody technologies that can confirm the presence of anthrax in 15 minutes or less, allowing decontamination and treatment to begin immediately. Similar test strips are being developed for the detection of smallpox as well.<br/>The biotech company EluSys Therapeutics is working on an exciting technique which would "implement instant immunity." EluSys joins two monoclonal antibodies chemically together so that they act like biological double-sided tape. One antibody sticks to toxins, viruses, or bacteria while the other binds to human red blood cells. The red blood cells carry the pathogen or toxin to the liver for destruction and return unharmed to the normal blood circulation.<br/>In one test, the EluSys treatment reduced the viral load in monkeys one million-fold in less than an hour. The technology could be applied to a number of bioterrorist threats, such as dengue fever, Ebola and Marburg viruses, and plague. Of course, the EluSys treatment would not just be useful for responding to bioterrorist attacks, but also could treat almost any infection or poisoning.<br/>Further down the development road are technologies that could rapidly analyze a pathogen’s DNA, and then guide the rapid synthesis of drugs like the ones being developed by EluSys that can bind, or disable, segments of DNA crucial to an infectious organism’s survival. Again, this technology would be a great boon for treating infectious diseases and might be a permanent deterrent to future bioterrorist attacks.<br/>Seizing Bayer’s patent now wouldn’t just cost that company and its stockholders a little bit <br/>AND<br/>they couldn’t be sure of earning enough profits to pay back their costs.<br/>Consider what happened during the Clinton health care fiasco, which threatened to impose price <br/>AND<br/>, America’s best biodefense is a vital and profitable pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry.&nbsp;</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HPatenttrollspreventinternetinnovation" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Patent trolls prevent internet innovation</span></h4><p><strong>Dawson 13</strong> – cofounder of the Internet Infrastructure Coalition (Christian, 6/5, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.i2coalition.com/patent-trolls-hurt-internet-freedom/)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.i2coalition.com/patent-trolls-hurt-internet-freedom/)%27" tppabs="http://www.i2coalition.com/patent-trolls-hurt-internet-freedom/)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.i2coalition.com/patent-trolls-hurt-internet-freedom/)</span></a></span><br/>I come from the open source world, which has been the most innovative space <br/>AND<br/>.

"For us, that’s important. Other issues aren’t as far along as that one."<br/>The Leadership Group is seeking higher pleading standards that would dissuade patent trolls from filing frivolous suits, shifting of legal fees to plaintiffs of spurious suits, improved records as to who owns patents, and protection against suits for companies that use technologies that are the subject of patent claims, according to briefing document prepared by the organization.<br/>The Silcion Valley Leadership Group divides its lobbying force of executives into small groups and has scheduled 64 meetings with legislators, including 16 with senators, according to briefing documents. The event is sponsored by a group of companies that includes SAP, Microsoft Corp., Verizon, AT26T and Virgin America. Participants pay a fee.<br/>Guardino said his group’s lobbying has yielded results in the past, including the government decision to place a U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in San Jose and funding for the extension of Bay Area Rapid Transit south toward the city.<br/>"While many would think advocating in D.C. is like watching grass grow, we have actually seen crops harvested on these trips," he said, noting that securing the PTO’s location took 5 ½ years.<br/>The delegation, led by Leadership Group chairman Steve Berglund, CEO of Trimble Navigation, and Vice Chairman Greg Becker, president at Silicon Valley Bank, is visiting a Congress on the mend. It has emerged from brinksmanship between the Democrats and Republicans that led to a government shutdown from Oct. 1 through Oct. 16.<br/>Still, with senate seats in play for the Nov. 4 election, posturing and defensive tactics may mean the window is closing on more controversial issues this year.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HBipartisanCompromisewillbesimilartothehousebill2013includesfeeshifting" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Bipartisan Compromise will be similar to the house bill – includes fee shifting</span></h4><p><strong>Pappas 4/24</strong> (Peter C, Rollcall News, "The Senate and Patent Reform: The Time Is Now | Commentary," 2014, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.rollcall.com/news/the_senate_and_patent_reform_the_time_is_now_commentary-232363-1.html?pos=oopih)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.rollcall.com/news/the_senate_and_patent_reform_the_time_is_now_commentary-232363-1.html?pos=oopih)%27" tppabs="http://www.rollcall.com/news/the_senate_and_patent_reform_the_time_is_now_commentary-232363-1.html?pos=oopih)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.rollcall.com/news/the_senate_and_patent_reform_the_time_is_now_commentary-232363-1.html?pos=oopih)</span></a></span></p><p>Recently, word from the Senate Judiciary Committee is that negotiators have reached a bipartisan <br/>AND<br/>when innovation is such a critical driver of economic growth and global competitiveness.</p><h4 id="HWinnersdon2019twinandPCtheoryistrue" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Winners don’t win and PC theory is true</span></h4><p>Todd Eberly is coordinator of Public Policy Studies and assistant professor in the Department of Political Science at St. Mary’s College of Maryland.

"Our No. 1 economic driver is international trade. Anything we can do to enhance and protect it is in our best interest."<br/>There are no rules forbidding public-private partnerships, said Chris Wilson, a trade expert at the Mexico Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. "It’s more a matter of creating a stable legal framework that everyone can refer to."<br/>One example of how this could work is underway along the California-Mexico border, where a group of investors have government approval to build an enclosed pedestrian bridge from San Diego to the Tijuana airport. In return for paying a toll, users will be able avoid traffic tie-ups elsewhere along the border. The walkway is scheduled to open next year.<br/>Congress has yet to act on any specific legislation to spur similar endeavors.
