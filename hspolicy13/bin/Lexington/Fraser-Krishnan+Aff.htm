The last few weeks of 2013 witnessed a rapid deterioration of the diplomatic goodwill that China had built among its maritime neighbors for decades, threatening regional stability and risking an arms race with the US and Japan.<br/>China’s declaration of a vast air-defense identification zone over disputed territories in the East China Sea was extremely contentious. The Chinese action was far more aggressive than had been acknowledged in the media.<br/>First, China has claimed more islands and waterways than it could actually possess under the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea. Seeing no challenge to the projection of its offshore power, China called the East and South China seas areas of its "core concern" in 2010, built garrisons in strategic islands, and invested in a deep-sea navy to compete with the US in western Pacific.<br/>When US Vice-President Joe Biden failed to persuade Chinese President Xi Jinping to abandon the newly imposed air-defense identification zone, China may interpret the US concession as a green light to the creation of another zone in the South China Sea, which would threaten the security of the Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam.<br/>Second, no institutional mechanism exists under current international laws to deal with the overlapping claims to maritime territories in East Asia. The latest diplomatic tensions arise due to a longstanding territorial conflict in which China proclaims to have sovereignty control over its maritime frontier.<br/>The sovereignty disputes have sharpened the irreconcilable differences between China and neighbors over control of maritime space, especially groups of resource-rich islands, and over maritime jurisdiction related to actions taking place at international waters. Unless there is a multilateral framework capable of mediating conflicts among the claimant states, maritime rifts will get intensified in 2014.<br/>Because of the escalating tensions, the East and South China seas have become a new battleground of US-Chinese rivalries. Detecting the rising discontent over Chinese offshore power projection, the US has not only clarified the status of the East and South China seas as open transportation corridors for all countries, but also supported Japan, South Korea, and the ASEAN to deal with China through multilateral negotiations, rather than bilateral talks that would only favor China.<br/>To the US and its allies, freedom of the seas is an important international law that guarantees the freedom of navigation for vessels of all countries on the high sea, and this is fundamental to the existing global system. Any nation’s attempt to make an open-ocean zone its territorial sovereignty goes against the principle of freedom of the seas.<br/>Fear of being marginalized, China condemned the ASEAN for siding with the US and Japan, and in so bullying Southeast Asia, China undercut decade-long diplomatic reassurances and confidence-building efforts. So far, China succeeded in using Cambodia to out-maneuverer the claimant countries of the ASEAN, especially Vietnam and the Philippines. This tactic was based on a premise that the ASEAN lacked a political will to confront China.<br/>However, China may have misjudged the international situation and overplayed its hands in declaring the new air zone. President Xi Jinping’s confidence has to do with the country’s strength as the second largest economy in the world, the biggest buyer of US Treasury bounds, and the seemingly least affected nation in the 2008 global financial crisis.<br/>But making other countries politically submissive is different from the art of winning trust and exercising leadership. China’s refusal to back down in maritime sovereignty disputes reveals the remnants of the Cold War thinking and the insensitivity towards many neighbors’ desires for peace.2</p><h4 id="HThatescalatestogreatpowernuclearwar" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>That escalates to great power nuclear war</span></h4><p><strong>Chakraborty 10</strong> (Tuhin Subhro Chakraborty, Research Associate at Rajiv Gandhi Institute for Contemporary Studies (RGICS), his primary area of work is centered on East Asia and International Relations.

But after two decades of sustained military modernization, the Chinese military has fundamentally changed its strategy in just the last year or so. According to Fuell, recent writings by PLA officers indicate "a growing confidence within the PLA that they can more-readily withstand U.S. involvement."<br/>The preemptive strike is off the table—and with it, the risk of a full-scale American counterattack. Instead, Beijing believes it can attack Taiwan or another neighbor while also bloodlessly deterring U.S. intervention. It would do so by deploying such overwhelmingly strong military forces—ballistic missiles, aircraft carriers, jet fighters and the like—that Washington dare not get involved.<br/>The knock-on effects of deterring America could be world-changing. "Backing away from our commitments to protect Taiwan, Japan or the Philippines would be tantamount to ceding East Asia to China’s domination," Roger Cliff, a fellow at the Atlantic Council, said at the same U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission hearing on Jan. 30.<br/>Worse, the world’s liberal economic order—and indeed, the whole notion of democracy—could suffer irreparable harm.

A proposed technical assistance program could help public sector entities build the bases on which they can develop both mitigation and adaptation greenhouse gas projects. <br/>Mitigation projects are the priority of the program since they are intended to directly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Adaptation projects are important as well, and it is recommended they be developed as "capacity building" initiatives to assist municipalities better manage the current realities of climate change.

Prevailing political thinking in Washington—and to a certain extent in Mexico City—and the current economic situation are not conducive to creating supranational structures; so while Europe bursts with a cumbersome and bloated institutional life, North America remains anemic by comparison. <br/>Its mere existence and capacity for reform given its small size and overhead make NADB <br/>AND<br/>areas where it can be a vital funding and capacity-building instrument. <br/>Mexico has sought a broader mandate for NADB since 2000.

Expand the mandate to include additional infrastructure sectors: <br/>The Bank requires a more flexible mandate that takes into account a broader set of criteria that do not focus excessively on quantifiable environmental benefits. Currently the Board sets very high environmental benefit thresholds on projects. Factors relating to the broader goals of infrastructure improvement and economic development should be considered in addition to environmental criteria in a balanced way. <br/>Some sectors are more amenable than others for bilateral cooperation. Water—and environmental <br/>AND<br/>, coordination and harmonization issues should continue to be part of NADB’s focus. <br/>The Bank should become more fully engaged with the development and expansion of ports of entry and border crossings. In the context of security imperatives, investments aimed at facilitating the construction and improvement of crossings through public-private partnerships might be the most important contribution to the border’s development today. <br/>The need for legislation to authorize further expansion into other infrastructure sectors has been debated. Some suggest it is simply an issue for the governments to resolve. However, given the restrictive interpretations of the charter, if a favorable legislative climate develops its amendment would be advisable if broad mandate expansion were to be considered. <br/>A lingering question is how much of a BECC certification process should be applied to projects in new sectors. Public and stakeholder participation in project development, approval and support has been a fundamental contribution of BECC over the years, but there is a concern—particularly among private sector investors—that it delays the funding process unduly. Expedited NADB lending approval processes will also be critical in order to foster more private sector participation. <br/>As new sectors are addressed, it will be crucial to find even more creative ways to mitigate risks, foster long-term financing in the local currency, and leverage funds from different sources. A key role for the NADB will be to help enhance project conditions and provide guarantees in order to link with private financial markets where affordable long-term funds in a multi-year programming context might be available.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h4 id="HTheplansolvesrenewablesdevelopment2014-financingandtechnicalassistancearekey" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>The plan solves renewables development—-financing and technical assistance are key</span></h4><p><strong>Wood 10</strong> — Duncan Wood, is the Director of the Mexico Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.

Its 2009 meeting in Monterrey, NL, had a significant emphasis on renewable energy at the border. The energy work table, for example, committed itself to three broad goals in the area:<br/>• identify and promote a United States?Mexico border region program for renewable energy by exchanging information on policies and financial incentives;<br/>• work with federal bi?national organizations, the Border Environment Cooperation Commission, the North American Development Bank and international organizations to facilitate project development; <br/>• identify financial opportunities for at least one renewable energy project before 2010.<br/>More importantly in terms of the long term vision of the BGC was the presentation <br/>AND<br/>improvement and prosperity, and to the potential for cross border RE flows.<br/>The Plan emphasized the further development of border renewable energy projects, and laid out a number of policy proposals (see table below), including the creation of a "geo?referenced database of renewable energy resources" as a necessary step on the road to fully developing RE along the border. But, perhaps the most important contribution of the Plan was to redefine the scope of the border region:<br/>The Plan contains an innovation regarding space: Rather than limiting itself to the area <br/>AND<br/>billion, equivalent to third?largest national economy in the world.59<br/>This redefinition of the border region is of vital importance for expanding renewable energy activities <br/>AND<br/>projects that could benefit from assistance from the NADBank and from the BGC.</p></div></div></td><td>2/17/14</td></tr><tr><td style="width:100%; word-break:break-all; word-break:break-word;"><div><p><input onclick="saveEntry(11)" src="../../xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" tppabs="http://hspolicy13.debatecoaches.org/xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" style="float:right;" title="Save" type="image" value="Save"></input>

But today this complex process faces serious domestic and international challenges which, if not overcome, will lead to reduced economic growth and ultimately a decline in living standards for future generations of Americans. <br/>Manufacturing’s innovation process is the key to past, present and future prosperity and higher <br/>AND<br/>living standards, most of it is hidden from view and poorly understood.<br/>Manufacturing’s innovation process provides enormous benefits for the entire U.S. economy:<br/>- Grows the Economy - Manufacturing growth spawns more additional economic activity and jobs than any other economic sector. Every 241 of final demand for manufactured goods generates an additional 240.67 in other manufactured products and 240.76 in products and services from nonmanufacturing sectors.<br/>- Invents the Future - Manufacturers are responsible for almost two-thirds of all private sector R26D – 24127 billion in 2002. Spillovers from this R26D benefit other manufacturing and nonmanufacturing firms. R26D spillovers are enhanced by geographic proximity. <br/>- Generates Productivity Increases - Manufacturing productivity gains are historically higher than those of any other economic sector – over the past two decades, manufacturing averaged twice the annual productivity gains of the rest of the private sector. These gains enable Americans to do more with less, increase our ability to compete, and facilitate higher wages for all employees. <br/>- Provides More Rewarding Employment - Manufacturing salaries and benefits average 2454,000, higher than the average for the total private sector. Two factors in particular attract workers to manufacturing: higher pay and benefits, and opportunities for advanced education and training. <br/>- Pays the Taxes - Manufacturing has been an important contributor to regional economic growth and tax receipts at all levels of government.

Their advantage is the proximity to the United States and to Western ports that ship to the Asian markets. They have access to a large, high-tech workforce in Tijuana, made up of engineers, technicians and software developers.<br/>But the main reason the companies come to Baja is simple: The cost of that highly skilled labor is low — about one-third of what it is in the U.S.<br/>Currently, the Baja aerospace industry employs more than 10,000 machine operators and technicians.

A proposed technical assistance program could help public sector entities build the bases on which they can develop both mitigation and adaptation greenhouse gas projects. <br/>Mitigation projects are the priority of the program since they are intended to directly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Adaptation projects are important as well, and it is recommended they be developed as "capacity building" initiatives to assist municipalities better manage the current realities of climate change.

Prevailing political thinking in Washington—and to a certain extent in Mexico City—and the current economic situation are not conducive to creating supranational structures; so while Europe bursts with a cumbersome and bloated institutional life, North America remains anemic by comparison. <br/>Its mere existence and capacity for reform given its small size and overhead make NADB <br/>AND<br/>areas where it can be a vital funding and capacity-building instrument. <br/>Mexico has sought a broader mandate for NADB since 2000. President Felipe Calderón has <br/>AND<br/>VI National Convention, American Chamber of Commerce; February 27, 2007). <br/>Some progress has been made along Pres. Calderon’s line of thinking.

Expand the mandate to include additional infrastructure sectors: <br/>The Bank requires a more flexible mandate that takes into account a broader set of criteria that do not focus excessively on quantifiable environmental benefits. Currently the Board sets very high environmental benefit thresholds on projects. Factors relating to the broader goals of infrastructure improvement and economic development should be considered in addition to environmental criteria in a balanced way. <br/>Some sectors are more amenable than others for bilateral cooperation. Water—and environmental <br/>AND<br/>, coordination and harmonization issues should continue to be part of NADB’s focus. <br/>The Bank should become more fully engaged with the development and expansion of ports of entry and border crossings. In the context of security imperatives, investments aimed at facilitating the construction and improvement of crossings through public-private partnerships might be the most important contribution to the border’s development today. <br/>The need for legislation to authorize further expansion into other infrastructure sectors has been debated. Some suggest it is simply an issue for the governments to resolve. However, given the restrictive interpretations of the charter, if a favorable legislative climate develops its amendment would be advisable if broad mandate expansion were to be considered. <br/>A lingering question is how much of a BECC certification process should be applied to projects in new sectors. Public and stakeholder participation in project development, approval and support has been a fundamental contribution of BECC over the years, but there is a concern—particularly among private sector investors—that it delays the funding process unduly. Expedited NADB lending approval processes will also be critical in order to foster more private sector participation. <br/>As new sectors are addressed, it will be crucial to find even more creative ways to mitigate risks, foster long-term financing in the local currency, and leverage funds from different sources. A key role for the NADB will be to help enhance project conditions and provide guarantees in order to link with private financial markets where affordable long-term funds in a multi-year programming context might be available.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h4 id="HAdditionally2CtheplancatalyzesrenewablesdevelopmentwithMexico2014theNADBankiskeytofinancingandtechnicalassistance." class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Additionally, the plan catalyzes renewables development with Mexico — the NADBank is key to financing and technical assistance.</span></h4><p><strong>Wood 10</strong> — Duncan Wood, is the Director of the Mexico Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.

Its 2009 meeting in Monterrey, NL, had a significant emphasis on renewable energy at the border. The energy work table, for example, committed itself to three broad goals in the area:<br/>• identify and promote a United States?Mexico border region program for renewable energy by exchanging information on policies and financial incentives;<br/>• work with federal bi?national organizations, the Border Environment Cooperation Commission, the North American Development Bank and international organizations to facilitate project development; <br/>• identify financial opportunities for at least one renewable energy project before 2010.<br/>More importantly in terms of the long term vision of the BGC was the presentation <br/>AND<br/>improvement and prosperity, and to the potential for cross border RE flows.<br/>The Plan emphasized the further development of border renewable energy projects, and laid out a number of policy proposals (see table below), including the creation of a "geo?referenced database of renewable energy resources" as a necessary step on the road to fully developing RE along the border. But, perhaps the most important contribution of the Plan was to redefine the scope of the border region:<br/>The Plan contains an innovation regarding space: Rather than limiting itself to the area <br/>AND<br/>billion, equivalent to third?largest national economy in the world.59<br/>This redefinition of the border region is of vital importance for expanding renewable energy activities <br/>AND<br/>projects that could benefit from assistance from the NADBank and from the BGC.</p></div></div></td><td>1/9/14</td></tr><tr><td style="width:100%; word-break:break-all; word-break:break-word;"><div><p><input onclick="saveEntry(12)" src="../../xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" tppabs="http://hspolicy13.debatecoaches.org/xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" style="float:right;" title="Save" type="image" value="Save"></input>

In the presentation, the argument is made that the primary reason this project deficit exists is due to:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>limited resources for project development, <br/>2. lack of capacity building, at the most fundamental level, in the public and public-private sectors, and <br/>3. lack of technical assistance program to address this deficit <br/>Specifically targeting a technical assistance program for renewable energy, energy efficiency, and transportation projects to achieve GHG reductions would be invaluable in promoting an environment for effective climate action in border communities. A proposed technical assistance program could help public sector entities build the bases on which they can develop both mitigation and adaptation greenhouse gas projects. <br/>Mitigation projects are the priority of the program since they are intended to directly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Adaptation projects are important as well, and it is recommended they be developed as "capacity building" initiatives to assist municipalities better manage the current realities of climate change. Ultimately, these project types do need technical assistance funds, and the funds will need a highly capacitated and experienced program manager.&nbsp;</li></ol><h4 id="H229Globalmodeling2014U.S.-Mexicocooperationpersuadesdevelopingeconomiestotransition.-2" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>2) Global modeling — U.S.-Mexico cooperation persuades developing economies to transition.</span></h4><p><strong>Selee 12</strong> — Vice President for Programs and Senior Advisor to the Mexico Institute, and Wilson, associate with the <br/>Mexico Institute (Andrew and Christopher, November, Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, "A New Agenda With Mexico," <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/a_new_agenda_with_mexico.pdf)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/a_new_agenda_with_mexico.pdf)%27" tppabs="http://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/a_new_agenda_with_mexico.pdf)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/a_new_agenda_with_mexico.pdf)</span></a></span></p><p>Over the past few years, the U.S. and Mexican governments have <br/>AND<br/>the developed and developing worlds, and between North America and Latin America.&nbsp;</p><h4 id="HThat2019skeytosolveclimatechange2014U.S.investmentinrenewablesiskey.-2" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>That’s key to solve climate change — U.S. investment in renewables is key.</span></h4><p><strong>Passell 12</strong> (Peter Passell, the Economics Editor of Democracy Lab, is a Senior Fellow at the Milken Institute, 5/23/12, "Two Worlds, One Climate," <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/05/23/two_worlds_one_climate?page=full)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/05/23/two_worlds_one_climate?page=full)%27" tppabs="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/05/23/two_worlds_one_climate?page=full)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/05/23/two_worlds_one_climate?page=full)</span></a></span></p><p>Climate change, we are often told, is everyone’s problem.

At one point she ~a coastal engineer~ said, ’You’re frustrating me. Why &nbsp;don’t you just tell me the answer?’ You know better than that. You’re not a politician. So &nbsp;that’s an example of how we were asked." <br/> <br/>This statement suggests that the role of scientists should end at the door of the &nbsp;decision-maker. Even though the practices of resource managers and city workers &nbsp;legitimate and reinforce the importance of science, scientists cannot (and should not) act &nbsp;as policy advisors. The presentation of science and policy as autonomous spheres of &nbsp;practice, even though they are widely understood and accepted as intimately intertwined, &nbsp;is the heart of the "science effect."<br/>&nbsp;The importance of this phenomenon is twofold. First, the nature of the <br/>AND<br/>This extended quote from a regional research scientist in &nbsp;Seattle captures this sentiment: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>"I try to be very clear about the fact that we cannot predict the <br/>AND<br/>our &nbsp;future,’ And that’s just the way you have to be."<br/>Importantly, I do not wish to claim that this is an inappropriate relationship. &nbsp;Indeed, good environmental policies are based on sound scientific information. Rather, &nbsp;the point here is that the "science effect" necessities a careful distinction between what is &nbsp;scientific fact and what is the perception of politicians. Scientists, it seems, walk the line &nbsp;of science and policy with great caution. <br/>Second, because of the need for objective and reliable scientific basis in climate &nbsp;policy, only those that produce or utilize this type of information are relevant<br/>for political &nbsp;practice. The City must go to great lengths to justify their environmental <br/>AND<br/>of action, the causes and &nbsp;consequences of which can be independently verified. &nbsp;<br/>Importantly, the three framings of science in Seattle presented here have forged a &nbsp;progressive <br/>AND<br/>effect" can often suggest that those scientists are no longer &nbsp;truly objective.<br/>&nbsp;Recently, some organizations have begun to integrate science and policy more &nbsp;aggressively. <br/>AND<br/>arrangements of their engagements, however, is one of separation and &nbsp;independence.<br/>&nbsp;Perhaps, the example provided by the City of Seattle and regional climate &nbsp;scientists <br/>AND<br/>experiences to scientific inquiry, are incorporated into the making of climate policy. &nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;</p><h4 id="HCreatingaglobalethicalcommitmenttofuturegenerationsistheONLYwaytoappreciatethemoralscopeofclimatechange2013governmentpolicyactionmustbetheprimarymoralfocustocreatechangeandunifysupport" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Creating a global ethical commitment to future generations is the ONLY way to appreciate the moral scope of climate change – government policy action must be the primary moral focus to create change and unify support</span></h4><p>Callicott 11 – (Oct. 2011, J.

Prevailing political thinking in Washington—and to a certain extent in Mexico City—and the current economic situation are not conducive to creating supranational structures; so while Europe bursts with a cumbersome and bloated institutional life, North America remains anemic by comparison. <br/>Its mere existence and capacity for reform given its small size and overhead make NADB <br/>AND<br/>areas where it can be a vital funding and capacity-building instrument. <br/>Mexico has sought a broader mandate for NADB since 2000. President Felipe Calderón has <br/>AND<br/>VI National Convention, American Chamber of Commerce; February 27, 2007). <br/>Some progress has been made along Pres. Calderon’s line of thinking. In 2008 <br/>AND<br/>part of their economic stimulus initiatives that will render synergies if closely coordinated. <br/>A drawn-out debate has taken place among environmentalists along the border who would <br/>AND<br/>sectors would enhance the Bank’s ability to respond to projects lacking credit capacity.<br/>Below are ten of the actions and policy initiatives that have been debated in recent years with regard to achieving an expanded and more effective role for NADB: <br/>A. Expand the mandate to include additional infrastructure sectors: <br/>The Bank requires a more flexible mandate that takes into account a broader set of criteria that do not focus excessively on quantifiable environmental benefits. Currently the Board sets very high environmental benefit thresholds on projects. Factors relating to the broader goals of infrastructure improvement and economic development should be considered in addition to environmental criteria in a balanced way. <br/>Some sectors are more amenable than others for bilateral cooperation. Water—and environmental <br/>AND<br/>, coordination and harmonization issues should continue to be part of NADB’s focus. <br/>The Bank should become more fully engaged with the development and expansion of ports of entry and border crossings. In the context of security imperatives, investments aimed at facilitating the construction and improvement of crossings through public-private partnerships might be the most important contribution to the border’s development today. <br/>The need for legislation to authorize further expansion into other infrastructure sectors has been debated. Some suggest it is simply an issue for the governments to resolve. However, given the restrictive interpretations of the charter, if a favorable legislative climate develops its amendment would be advisable if broad mandate expansion were to be considered. <br/>A lingering question is how much of a BECC certification process should be applied to projects in new sectors. Public and stakeholder participation in project development, approval and support has been a fundamental contribution of BECC over the years, but there is a concern—particularly among private sector investors—that it delays the funding process unduly. Expedited NADB lending approval processes will also be critical in order to foster more private sector participation. <br/>As new sectors are addressed, it will be crucial to find even more creative ways to mitigate risks, foster long-term financing in the local currency, and leverage funds from different sources. A key role for the NADB will be to help enhance project conditions and provide guarantees in order to link with private financial markets where affordable long-term funds in a multi-year programming context might be available.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h4 id="HTheplansolvesrenewablesdevelopment2014-financingandtechnicalassistancearekey-1" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>The plan solves renewables development—-financing and technical assistance are key</span></h4><p><strong>Wood 10</strong> — Duncan Wood, is the Director of the Mexico Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.

Its 2009 meeting in Monterrey, NL, had a significant emphasis on renewable energy at the border. The energy work table, for example, committed itself to three broad goals in the area:<br/>• identify and promote a United States?Mexico border region program for renewable energy by exchanging information on policies and financial incentives;<br/>• work with federal bi?national organizations, the Border Environment Cooperation Commission, the North American Development Bank and international organizations to facilitate project development; <br/>• identify financial opportunities for at least one renewable energy project before 2010.<br/>More importantly in terms of the long term vision of the BGC was the presentation <br/>AND<br/>improvement and prosperity, and to the potential for cross border RE flows.<br/>The Plan emphasized the further development of border renewable energy projects, and laid out a number of policy proposals (see table below), including the creation of a "geo?referenced database of renewable energy resources" as a necessary step on the road to fully developing RE along the border. But, perhaps the most important contribution of the Plan was to redefine the scope of the border region:<br/>The Plan contains an innovation regarding space: Rather than limiting itself to the area <br/>AND<br/>billion, equivalent to third?largest national economy in the world.59<br/>This redefinition of the border region is of vital importance for expanding renewable energy activities <br/>AND<br/>projects that could benefit from assistance from the NADBank and from the BGC.</p></div></div></td><td>4/12/14</td></tr><tr><td style="width:100%; word-break:break-all; word-break:break-word;"><div><p><input onclick="saveEntry(15)" src="../../xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" tppabs="http://hspolicy13.debatecoaches.org/xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" style="float:right;" title="Save" type="image" value="Save"></input>

Prevailing political thinking in Washington—and to a certain extent in Mexico City—and the current economic situation are not conducive to creating supranational structures; so while Europe bursts with a cumbersome and bloated institutional life, North America remains anemic by comparison. <br/>Its mere existence and capacity for reform given its small size and overhead make NADB <br/>AND<br/>areas where it can be a vital funding and capacity-building instrument. <br/>Mexico has sought a broader mandate for NADB since 2000. President Felipe Calderón has <br/>AND<br/>VI National Convention, American Chamber of Commerce; February 27, 2007). <br/>Some progress has been made along Pres. Calderon’s line of thinking. In 2008 <br/>AND<br/>part of their economic stimulus initiatives that will render synergies if closely coordinated. <br/>A drawn-out debate has taken place among environmentalists along the border who would <br/>AND<br/>sectors would enhance the Bank’s ability to respond to projects lacking credit capacity.<br/>Below are ten of the actions and policy initiatives that have been debated in recent years with regard to achieving an expanded and more effective role for NADB: <br/>A. Expand the mandate to include additional infrastructure sectors: <br/>The Bank requires a more flexible mandate that takes into account a broader set of criteria that do not focus excessively on quantifiable environmental benefits. Currently the Board sets very high environmental benefit thresholds on projects. Factors relating to the broader goals of infrastructure improvement and economic development should be considered in addition to environmental criteria in a balanced way. <br/>Some sectors are more amenable than others for bilateral cooperation. Water—and environmental <br/>AND<br/>, coordination and harmonization issues should continue to be part of NADB’s focus. <br/>The Bank should become more fully engaged with the development and expansion of ports of entry and border crossings. In the context of security imperatives, investments aimed at facilitating the construction and improvement of crossings through public-private partnerships might be the most important contribution to the border’s development today. <br/>The need for legislation to authorize further expansion into other infrastructure sectors has been debated. Some suggest it is simply an issue for the governments to resolve. However, given the restrictive interpretations of the charter, if a favorable legislative climate develops its amendment would be advisable if broad mandate expansion were to be considered. <br/>A lingering question is how much of a BECC certification process should be applied to projects in new sectors. Public and stakeholder participation in project development, approval and support has been a fundamental contribution of BECC over the years, but there is a concern—particularly among private sector investors—that it delays the funding process unduly. Expedited NADB lending approval processes will also be critical in order to foster more private sector participation. <br/>As new sectors are addressed, it will be crucial to find even more creative ways to mitigate risks, foster long-term financing in the local currency, and leverage funds from different sources. A key role for the NADB will be to help enhance project conditions and provide guarantees in order to link with private financial markets where affordable long-term funds in a multi-year programming context might be available.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h3 id="Hnew" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>new</span></h3><h4 id="HCONTENTION_:MDBs"

So far, the truce has largely held, although three rockets did hit southern Israel from the Gaza Strip on Monday.<br/>The cabinet meeting began at about 11 P.M. Sunday and adjourned at about 3 A.M. Monday morning. The ministers were briefed by senior defense officials, but were not asked to approve any further military action. Instead, the meeting focused on ways to contain the situation and prevent an escalation.<br/>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Ehud Barak offered various arguments for why Israel must exercise restraint - its international isolation, the fact that the Iron Dome rocket interception system still offers only partial defense, and the fear of worsening the diplomatic crisis with Egypt. Under these circumstances, Netanyahu said, all-out war against Hamas-run Gaza would be inadvisable.<br/>Prior to the cabinet meeting, several ministers had called for a harsher Israeli response to the rocket fire; and that is largely what prompted Netanyahu to convene the cabinet Sunday night: By having the full cabinet approve the decision to refrain from further military action, he hoped to block criticism from within the government.<br/>What emerged most clearly from Netanyahu’s and Barak’s statements to the cabinet was that Israel lacks the international legitimacy needed for a large-scale operation in Gaza. The diplomatic crisis with Egypt further constrains Israel’s freedom of action.<br/>"The prime minister thinks it would be wrong to race into a total war in Gaza right now," one of Netanyahu’s advisors said. "We are preparing to respond if the fire continues, but Israel will not be dragged into places it doesn’t want to be."<br/>Several Netanyahu aides detailed the constraints on Israeli military action, most of which are diplomatic.<br/>"There’s a sensitive situation in the Middle East, which is one big boiling pot; there’s the international arena; there’s the Palestinian move in the Untied Nations in September," when the Palestinians hope to obtain UN recognition as a state, one advisor enumerated. "We have to pick our way carefully."<br/>But there were also military constraints, the aides noted. For one, the Israel Defense Forces do not yet have enough Iron Dome batteries to defend the home front.<br/>"If we had even one more battery, we could defend another medium-sized city," one aide said. "That’s precisely why we need to prepare instead of rushing into war."</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HNoimpacttoIranprolif2Cit2019sallposturingandnoonewilluseweapons" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>No impact to Iran prolif, it’s all posturing and no one will use weapons</span></h4><p><strong>Copley 13</strong><br/>~Gregory, director of Australia’s new grand strategy research organization, the Future Directions Institute (FDI) (originally known as the Centre for International Strategic Analysis: CISA), in Perth, Western Australia.

She called new polling data showing a 64 percent to 57 percent enthusiasm gap between Republicans and Democrats "pretty sobering."<br/>In midterm elections, Democrats typically lag Republicans in intensity by 10-15 points, but the gap is 17 points, she said.<br/>A new George Washington University Battleground Poll, for example, found that just 36 percent of voters 18-29 are "extremely likely" to vote in the midterm elections. It’s 38 percent for single women. Both were key Obama support groups in his two presidential elections.<br/>The voter enthusiasm gap played out in the recent special election in Florida’s 13th Congressional District, where the GOP surprised the Democrats with an effective get-out-the-vote program — and victory.<br/>Adding to the Democratic woes is the historic pattern of losses in the president’s party during his sixth year and just the fact that Obama isn’t on the ballot. "There is a huge turnout disadvantage and challenge," said Lake, adding, "there is always a challenge in turnout in an off year, but it’s really dramatic this time."<br/>Worse, she said, as Democrats give up hopes of winning back the House to save the Senate, there is growing concerns that the GOP could hit House Democrats starved of money.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HForeignpolicydistractionswrecktheagenda" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Foreign policy distractions wreck the agenda</span></h4><p>Dana <strong>Milbank 4/24</strong>, Delaware Online News Journal, "What’s missing from Obama’s Asia trip?

Like Rasputin (or Whac-A-Mole,) it keeps coming back even after it has been bludgeoned and obliterated by facts and logic. I feel compelled to whack this mole once more.<br/>The meme is what Matthew Yglesias, writing in 2006, referred to as "<br/>AND<br/>Dan Rostenkowski and Bill Bradley to get tax reform, and so on.<br/>If only Obama had dealt with Congress the way LBJ did—persuading, cajoling<br/>AND<br/>have a fiscal deal that would solve the long-term debt problem.<br/>If only the proponents of this theory would step back and look at the realities of all these presidencies (or would read or reread the Richard Neustadt classic, Presidential Power.)<br/>I do understand the sentiment here and the frustration over the deep dysfunction that has taken over our politics. It is tempting to believe that a president could overcome the tribalism, polarization, and challenges of the permanent campaign, by doing what other presidents did to overcome their challenges. It is not as if passing legislation and making policy was easy in the old days.<br/>But here is the reality, starting with the Johnson presidency. I do not <br/>AND<br/>rights to Medicare to elementary and secondary education reform, than any other.<br/>LBJ had a lot to do with the agenda, and the accomplishments. But <br/>AND<br/>on final passage of key bills to ensure the legitimacy of the actions.<br/>Johnson deserves credit for horse-trading (for example, finding concessions to give <br/>AND<br/>cajoling and persuading and horse-trading in the world did not matter.<br/>Now briefly consider other presidents. Ronald Reagan was a master negotiator, and he <br/>AND<br/>, who put together immigration legislation with limited involvement by the White House.<br/>As for Bill Clinton, he was as politically adept as any president in modern <br/>AND<br/>in the majority, and ended shortly after they had accomplished that goal.<br/>When Obama had the numbers, not as robust as LBJ’s but robust enough, <br/>AND<br/>like health reform and raising taxes as part of a broad budget deal.<br/>Could Obama have done more to bond with lawmakers? Sure, especially with members <br/>AND<br/>.
