A military al¶ liance has not yet¶ been established, but¶ with¶ the creation of a¶ U¶ .¶ S¶ .¶ Northern Command, and the re¶ structuring of¶ U.S.¶ security policies under the aegis of the De¶ partment of Homeland Security,¶ Mexican territory¶ has become a de facto part of the¶ U¶ .¶ S¶ .¶ homeland¶ to protect; a sort of thick and extended border,¶ though which potential or suspicious enemies, illegal goods, and people, ought to be detected¶ and deterred in order to prevent harm to the¶ U¶ .¶ S¶ .¶ (Morales 2008¶ a¶ , 147¶ -¶ 68).¶ 26¶ Similar to the¶ situation witnessed during WWII, oil and energy resources are part of this renewed geopolitical¶ alliance, but not necessarily its core. Once again, Mexico is functioning as a sort of buffer¶ space¶ —¶ providing strategic resources to the¶ U¶ .¶ S¶ .¶ wh¶ ile helping to filter and deter threats and¶ possible attacks.¶ Since the implementation of NAFTA, however, some American scholars prefer to consider¶ Mexico a “pivotal” or “critical” state rather than a simple buffer zone. Pivotal states are to be¶ understood as those nations that are not “great powers,” per se, but rat¶ her emerging or¶ developing economies that are critical to U S interests. They are strategic and important for¶ 26¶ Established Oct. 1, 2002, the U.S. Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) provides command and control of¶ Department of Defense (DOD) homeland defense efforts and coordinates defense support of civil authorities.¶ USNORTHCOM’s area¶ of monitoring includes air, land and sea approaches and encompasses the continental United¶ States, Alaska, Canada, Mexico and the¶ surrounding water out to approximately 500 nautical miles. It also includes¶ the Gulf of Mexico, the Straits of Florida, porti¶ ons of the Caribbean region to include The Bahamas, Puerto Rico¶ and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Furthermore, the commander of USNORTHCOM is responsible for theater security¶ cooperation with Canada, Mexico, and The Bahamas (See:¶ <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.northcom.mil/home.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.northcom.mil/home.html%27" tppabs="http://www.northcom.mil/home.html"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.northcom.mil/home.html</span></a></span>¶ ). It is in this sense,¶ that Canada, Mexico and the Bahamas have become a critical surrounding of the U¶ .¶ S¶ .¶ homeland to be protected¶ .¶ The Energy Factor in Mexico¶ -¶ U.S.¶ Relations¶ 31¶ American interests and regional and international stability due to a confluence of factors, not all¶ of which have to be present, such as: 1) geos¶ trategic importance; 2) uncertain evolution; 3)¶ potentially conveying significant beneficial or harmful¶ effects on their regions; and 4¶ ) the¶ possibilities for playing a key role on cross¶ -¶ cutting multilateral negotiations (Chase et al. 1999,¶ 6¶ -¶ 7).¶ Mexican¶ scholars and practitioners prefer to conceive of Mexico as a “middle power” or a¶ “commercial power” (Rico 2010, 112; González 2010; Espinosa 2010), but in recent decades, the¶ country has become pivotal for enhancing or jeopardizing American interests. NAFT¶ A has¶ transformed Mexico’s economy and the pattern of trade specialization with the¶ U¶ .¶ S¶ .¶ and Canada,¶ and the SPP has made the country a strategic¶ U¶ .¶ S¶ .¶ partner for combating old and new foes. While¶ Mexico’s geopolitical and geo¶ -¶ economical positions of the c¶ ountry were evident, there was¶ uncertainty about how the country would develop and what the impact on the region would be.¶ Pivots are by definition “wobbly” or “tippy,” that is, they could evolve toward confident, stable¶ regional powers or, to the contrary¶ , become unstable, unable to maintain local or regional order,¶ and lapse into chaos (Chase et al. 1999, 7). Unfortunately, since the inception of SPP, Mexico¶ has moved to an unstable and problematic scenario, which has prompted the¶ U¶ .¶ S¶ .¶ to treat security¶ w¶ ith its southern neighbor on a bilateral basis.¶ Indeed, the trilateral approach envisioned by SPP in both energy issues and security concerns¶ faded out with the Obama administration (2008¶ -¶ 2012). Trade, energy, and security concerns¶ remain on the North Ame¶ rican agenda but not as a trilateral policy issue, as originally envisioned¶ by SPP. A new era of bilateralism has emerged in which the violence and security concerns¶ related to the activities of transnational criminal organizations dominate the¶ U¶ .¶ S¶ .¶ -¶ Mexico¶ agenda.¶ For the past two years, “border security” has been the top priority between the two countries,¶ while trade and energy issues have become secondary.¶ Today, Mexico is an unstable and uncertain pivot. At risk is not only the decline of Mexico’s oil¶ output and consequently of exports, but the proliferation of “lawless spaces” ruled by local and¶ international organized crime organizations. During WWII and the Cold War years, Mexico¶ became a reliable buffer to¶ U¶ .¶ S¶ .¶ interests, despite government nationa¶ listic and revolutionary¶ The Energy Factor in Mexico¶ -¶ U.S.¶ Relations¶ 32¶ rhetoric, which the¶ U¶ .¶ S¶ .¶ accepted and tolerated even when it transcended Mexico’s international¶ and regional positions. At present, the domestic political situation of the country seems to be¶ more fragile and complicated, and the e¶ ntanglement of the country with¶ U¶ .¶ S¶ .¶ international¶ interests and concerns much more complex. As Peter Smith, a respected American scholar on¶ Mexico, put it some years ago: If Mexico functions as a “critical state” to¶ U¶ .¶ S¶ .¶ interests, the¶ ultimate goal of Wa¶ shington is to support development and political stability south of the border.¶ This could be done¶ —¶ as hypothesized by Smith¶ —¶ by lifting all cross¶ -¶ borders restrictions to labor¶ migration and by legalizing the sale and consumption of drugs. Smith, of course,¶ realizes that¶ these two policy options are not feasible at present times, so he envisions a cooperative scenario¶ between the two nations building on NAFTA and other bilateral commitments (Smith 2009, 240¶ -¶ 243). The worst scenario would be, of course, an es¶ calation of violence and instability in the¶ country, with a more aggressive capture of political elites by organized crime interests, and with¶ the cancelation of Mexico’s democratic and civic liberties. Amid such pessimism, there is hope¶ in that both Mexic¶ an and American civil societies share the same interests, since neither desires a¶ further degradation of the political situation in Mexico. The challenge is to construct new¶ institutional architecture through which the two countries can work for both their¶ own and¶ mutual interests in the near future. <br/>Heg solves multiple scenarios for nuclear war <br/>Brooks et al 13<br/>Stephen G.

In 2010, Mexico was the seventh-largest producer of oil in the world and the third largest in the Western Hemisphere. 39 The Mexican government depends heavily on oil revenues, which provide 30 to 40 of the government’s fiscal revenues, but oil production in Mexico is declining rapidly. Many industry experts state that Mexican oil production has peaked and that the country’s production will continue to decline in the coming years. 40 The Mexican government has used oil revenues from its state oil company, Pétroleos Mexicanos (Pemex), for government operating expenses, which has come at the expense of needed reinvestment in the company itself. Because the government relies so heavily on oil income, any decline in production has major fiscal implications. In 2008, the government enacted new legislation that sought to reform the country’s oil sector, which was nationalized in 1938, 41 and to help increase production capability. The reforms permit Pemex to create incentive-based service contracts with private companies. Some analysts contend, however, that the reforms did not go far enough and that they do little to help the company address its major challenges. 42 Mexico’s President-elect Enrique Peña Nieto of the centrist Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) has vowed to convince his party, which nationalized the industry and has blocked previous attempts at reforming the energy sector, and the PRI-aligned oil workers’ union, to allow further energy reforms to move forward. The narrow margin of Peña Nieto’s victory and his coalition’s apparent failure to capture a majority in either chamber of the Mexican Congress, however, may make it difficult to reform the energy sector. Another issue that may block energy reforms from moving forward is the nationalist left’s strong showing in the July 1, 2012, elections. The leftist coalition led by the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) has the second-largest bloc in the lower house of the Mexican Congress and remains staunchly opposed to increasing private involvement in Pemex. 43 Most experts contend that Pemex has only the capacity to produce in shallow waters and needs to bring in new technologies and know-how through private investment to allow the company to successfully explore and produce in the deep waters in the Gulf of Mexico. 44 The lack of further reforms is reportedly keeping Mexico from allowing much-needed foreign investment for oil exploration. Though the performance-based contracts are expected to increase production and reserves, Pemex faces serious challenges in finding new, productive wells and also lacks resources for investment in increasing engineering capacity and exploration.<br/>Renewables investment brings vast economic benefit to Mexico – creates jobs, income, and tax revenue that gets funneled into public goods<br/>Wood 12 (Duncan Wood, 5/20/12 Department of International Affairs, Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México, Senior Advisor, Mexico Institute Renewable Energy Initiative, "RE-Energizing the Border: Renewable Energy, Green Jobs and Border Infrastructure Project," Wilson Center, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/RE_Energizing_Border_Wood.pdf-http://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/RE_Energizing_Border_Wood.pdf)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path excluded from retrieval by the project\%27s Exclusions properties.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/RE_Energizing_Border_Wood.pdf-http://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/RE_Energizing_Border_Wood.pdf)%27" tppabs="http://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/RE_Energizing_Border_Wood.pdf-http://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/RE_Energizing_Border_Wood.pdf)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/RE_Energizing_Border_Wood.pdf-http://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/RE_Energizing_Border_Wood.pdf)</span></a></span><br/>Economic spillover: It is clear that the development of renewable energy projects brings economic <br/>AND<br/>and businesses, but also implies a potential obstacle due to financing limitations.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>Mexican economic collapse kills US and Mexico’s manufacturing sectors<br/>Villarreal ’10 ~9/16/10, M.

Norton Schwartz and a bevy of other government and industry speakers. ¶ He offered a sneak preview of his symposium presentation and answered various questions about the future of technology and warfare in early August. ¶ "The superiority of convergent technologies will prevent war," Doctor Canton said, claiming their power would present an overwhelming deterrent to potential adversaries. While saying that the U.S. will build these super systems faster and better than other nations, he acknowledged that a new arms race is already under way. ¶ "It will be a new MAD for the 21st century," he said, referring to the Cold War-era acronym for Mutually Assured Destruction, the idea that a nuclear first strike would trigger an equally deadly response. It’s commonly held that this knowledge has essentially prevented any rational state from launching a nuclear attack. ¶ Likewise, Doctor Canton said he believes rational nation states, considering this imminent technology explosion, will see the futility of nation-on-nation warfare in the near future. Plus there’s the "socio-economic linking of the global market system." ¶ "The fundamental macroeconomics on the planet favor peace, security, capitalism and prosperity," he said. Doctor Canton projects that nations, including those not currently allied, will work together in using these smart technologies to prevent non-state actors from engaging in disruptive and deadly acts. ¶ As a futurist, Doctor Canton and his team study and predict many things, but their main area of expertise — and the one in which he’s personally most interested — is advanced and emerging technology. ¶ "I see that as the key catalyst of strategic change on the planet, and it will be for the next 100 years," he said. He focuses on six specific technology areas: "nano, bio, IT, neuro, quantum and robotics;" those he expects to converge in so powerful a way. ¶&nbsp;</p><p>Manufacturing capabilities key to technology necessary for U.S. deterrence<br/>O’Hanlon et al 12 (Mackenzie Eaglen, American Enterprise Institute Rebecca Grant, IRIS Research Robert P.

The long border shared by the two countries, so often seen as a point of conflict due to the thorny issues of migration, drugs and security, holds the potential to benefit both states through the trade in renewable energy from wind, geothermal, biomass and solar sources. But the promise of collaboration in the sector goes far beyond the border.

At the same time, Mexican President Vicente Fox (2000-2006), the first &nbsp;president to be elected from an opposition party in 71 years, has sought to strengthen &nbsp;the relationship with the United States through what some have called a "grand &nbsp;bargain." Under this proposed bargain, the United States would regularize the status &nbsp;of undocumented Mexican workers in the United States and economically assist the &nbsp;less developed partner in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), &nbsp;while Mexico would be more cooperative in efforts to control the illegal traffic of &nbsp;drugs, people, and goods into the United States. &nbsp;The southern neighbor is linked with the United States through trade and &nbsp;investment, migration and tourism, environment and health concerns, and family and &nbsp;cultural relationships. It is the second most important trading partner of the United &nbsp;States, and this trade is critical to many U.S. industries and border communities. It &nbsp;is a major source of undocumented migrants and illicit drugs and a possible avenue &nbsp;for the entry of terrorists into the United States.

Meeting in Washington, U.S. President Barack Obama, Canada’s President Stephen Harper and Mexico’s President Felipe Calderon committed their governments to enhance their collective energy security, to facilitate "seamless energy flows on the interconnected grid" and to promote trade and investment in clean energy technologies. They will cooperate in expanding cooperation "to create clean energy jobs and combat climate change," the leaders said in a joint statement. "Enhanced electricity interconnection in the Americas would advance the goals of the Energy and Climate Partnership of the Americas to reduce energy poverty and increase the use of renewable sources of energy," the three leaders said. They recognized Mexico’s leadership in supporting inter-connections in Central America and reaffirmed their support "to bring affordable, reliable, and increasingly renewable power to businesses and homes in Central America and the Caribbean while opening wider markets for clean energy and green technology." During a joint news conference this afternoon, President Obama said, "Between us, we represent nearly half-a-billion citizens, from Nunavut in the Canadian north to Chiapas in southern Mexico. In between, the diversity of our peoples and cultures is extraordinary. But wherever they live, they wake up every day with similar hopes – to provide for their families, to be safe in their communities, to give their children a better life. And in each of our countries, the daily lives of our citizens are shaped profoundly by what happens in the other two. And that’s why we’re here."

Not only do they present a study with a striking conclusion, driven by data, free of theoretical or ideological bias, but they also do something quite unfashionable: they bear good news. Social scientists really are not supposed to do that. Our job is, if not to be Malthusians, then at least to point out disturbing trends, looming catastrophes, and the imbecility and mendacity of policy makers. And then it is to say why, if people listen to us, things will get better. We do this as if our careers depended upon it, and perhaps they do; for if all is going to be well, what need then for us? Our colleagues at Simon Fraser University are brave indeed. That may sound like a setup, but it is not. I shall challenge neither the data nor the general conclusion that violent conflict around the world has been decreasing in fits and starts since the Second World War. When it comes to violent conflict among and within countries, things have been getting better. (The trends have not been linear—Figure 1.1 actually shows that the frequency of interstate wars peaked in the 1980s—but the 65-year movement is clear.) Instead I shall accept that Mack et al. are correct on the macro-trends, and focus on their explanations they advance for these remarkable trends. With apologies to any readers of this forum who recoil from academic debates, this might get mildly theoretical and even more mildly methodological. Concerning international wars, one version of the "nuclear-peace" theory is not in fact laid to rest by the data. It is certainly true that nuclear-armed states have been involved in many wars. They have even been attacked (think of Israel), which falsifies the simple claim of "assured destruction"—that any nuclear country A will deter any kind of attack by any country B because B fears a retaliatory nuclear strike from A. But the most important "nuclear-peace" claim has been about mutually assured destruction, which obtains between two robustly nuclear-armed states. The claim is that (1) rational states having second-strike capabilities—enough deliverable nuclear weaponry to survive a nuclear first strike by an enemy—will have an overwhelming incentive not to attack one another; and (2) we can safely assume that nuclear-armed states are rational. It follows that states with a second-strike capability will not fight one another. Their colossal atomic arsenals neither kept the United States at peace with North Vietnam during the Cold War nor the Soviet Union at peace with Afghanistan. But the argument remains strong that those arsenals did help keep the United States and Soviet Union at peace with each other. Why non-nuclear states are not deterred from fighting nuclear states is an important and open question. But in a time when calls to ban the Bomb are being heard from more and more quarters, we must be clear about precisely what the broad trends toward peace can and cannot tell us. They may tell us nothing about why we have had no World War III, and little about the wisdom of banning the Bomb now. Regarding the downward trend in international war, Professor Mack is friendlier to more palatable theories such as the "democratic peace" (democracies do not fight one another, and the proportion of democracies has increased, hence less war); the interdependence or "commercial peace" (states with extensive economic ties find it irrational to fight one another, and interdependence has increased, hence less war); and the notion that people around the world are more anti-war than their forebears were. Concerning the downward trend in civil wars, he favors theories of economic growth (where commerce is enriching enough people, violence is less appealing—a logic similar to that of the "commercial peace" thesis that applies among nations) and the end of the Cold War (which end reduced superpower support for rival rebel factions in so many Third-World countries). These are all plausible mechanisms for peace. What is more, none of them excludes any other; all could be working toward the same end. That would be somewhat puzzling, however. Is the world just lucky these days? How is it that an array of peace-inducing factors happens to be working coincidentally in our time, when such a magical array was absent in the past? The answer may be that one or more of these mechanisms reinforces some of the others, or perhaps some of them are mutually reinforcing. Some scholars, for example, have been focusing on whether economic growth might support democracy and vice versa, and whether both might support international cooperation, including to end civil wars. We would still need to explain how this charmed circle of causes got started, however. And here let me raise another factor, perhaps even less appealing than the "nuclear peace" thesis, at least outside of the United States. That factor is what international relations scholars call hegemony—specifically American hegemony. A theory that many regard as discredited, but that refuses to go away, is called hegemonic stability theory. The theory emerged in the 1970s in the realm of international political economy. It asserts that for the global economy to remain open—for countries to keep barriers to trade and investment low—one powerful country must take the lead. Depending on the theorist we consult, "taking the lead" entails paying for global public goods (keeping the sea lanes open, providing liquidity to the international economy), coercion (threatening to raise trade barriers or withdraw military protection from countries that cheat on the rules), or both. The theory is skeptical that international cooperation in economic matters can emerge or endure absent a hegemon. The distastefulness of such claims is self-evident: they imply that it is good for everyone the world over if one country has more wealth and power than others. More precisely, they imply that it has been good for the world that the United States has been so predominant. There is no obvious reason why hegemonic stability theory could not apply to other areas of international cooperation, including in security affairs, human rights, international law, peacekeeping (UN or otherwise), and so on. What I want to suggest here—suggest, not test—is that American hegemony might just be a deep cause of the steady decline of political deaths in the world. How could that be? After all, the report states that United States is the third most war-prone country since 1945. Many of the deaths depicted in Figure 10.4 were in wars that involved the United States (the Vietnam War being the leading one). Notwithstanding politicians’ claims to the contrary, a candid look at U.S. foreign policy reveals that the country is as ruthlessly self-interested as any other great power in history. The answer is that U.S. hegemony might just be a deeper cause of the proximate causes outlined by Professor Mack. Consider economic growth and openness to foreign trade and investment, which (so say some theories) render violence irrational. American power and policies may be responsible for these in two related ways. First, at least since the 1940s Washington has prodded other countries to embrace the market capitalism that entails economic openness and produces sustainable economic growth. The United States promotes capitalism for selfish reasons, of course: its own domestic system depends upon growth, which in turn depends upon the efficiency gains from economic interaction with foreign countries, and the more the better. During the Cold War most of its allies accepted some degree of market-driven growth. Second, the U.S.-led western victory in the Cold War damaged the credibility of alternative paths to development—communism and import-substituting industrialization being the two leading ones—and left market capitalism the best model. The end of the Cold War also involved an end to the billions of rubles in Soviet material support for regimes that tried to make these alternative models work. (It also, as Professor Mack notes, eliminated the superpowers’ incentives to feed civil violence in the Third World.) What we call globalization is caused in part by the emergence of the United States as the global hegemon. The same case can be made, with somewhat more difficulty, concerning the spread of democracy. Washington has supported democracy only under certain conditions—the chief one being the absence of a popular anti-American movement in the target state—but those conditions have become much more widespread following the collapse of communism. Thus in the 1980s the Reagan administration—the most anti-communist government America ever had—began to dump America’s old dictator friends, starting in the Philippines. Today Islamists tend to be anti-American, and so the Obama administration is skittish about democracy in Egypt and other authoritarian Muslim countries. But general U.S. material and moral support for liberal democracy remains strong.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>Impact turns inevitable-&nbsp;</p><p>a.

I am both powerful and powerless. &nbsp;I live in the moment. &nbsp;I live in the past.<br/>?<br/>Student and Debate<br/>I am a very involved member of my community, having been an active leader on my debate team, sports broadcasting organization, community service projects, and my Jewish youth program. I have really treasured my activity within debate because of the global awareness comparative analysis skills that I have garnered. But, I am so much more than a debater. I love sports because of the competitive spirit present at games and involved in following the seasons. However, I am not a self-centered individual. I have collected over 2000 water bottles for the homeless in Nashville in addition to collecting hygienic goods for the homeless as well. As proud as I am of all of these activities, my involvement in my Jewish youth group, AZA, has been a way of evoking my most central trait, my Judaism. I treasure my ability to hang out with other Jewish teenagers as I am surrounded by many white, Christian males at my high school. My Judaism has been a large facet in all of my life, starting with my family.<br/>I am proud to be a part of a family of five living in Nashville, Tennessee. Though many people may know me as hesitant and cautious with my thoughts, I hold nothing back when I say that I enjoy the presence of my immediate family and I savor the special visits to see extended family on certain occasions. One of my favorite events is our annual Thanksgiving feast during which over fifty members of my family will gather in one city for such a beautiful time of year. We all laugh, recount the past year, and most importantly watch football. However, there is so much more to our reunions often than simply watching football and talking in person about the year’s past events. Recently, this marvelous weekend has been completed with a family member’s bar or bat mitzvah, the rite of passage for a Jewish teenager. These events always add a special flare to my family because, while everyone in the country finishes the bulk of their celebration on the presiding Thursday, we are willing to continue the party through the weekend. But, we see this more through a supportive and celebratory lens for every member than a lens that utilizes the weekend for personal enjoyment. None of these connections would ever have been able to derive themselves had it not been for my family’s predominant religion and our commitment to observing it as a group.<br/>I had previously mentioned my family’s love for football. My passion for sports has grown so much beyond just the one sport. An avid fan of all four major sports, hockey, football, basketball, and baseball, I crave nothing more than to sit down and watch games for hours on end. Unfortunately, given my genes, I am not the most athletic and will never be able to participate competitively in these sports myself. When this realization hit me in middle school, I was at a loss for how to approach the situation. A young boy who had always shined athletically next to his Jewish friends no longer had the opportunity to pursue sports successfully. However, once I reached high school. I had the chance to join a Jewish, high school fraternity called AZA. As it is part of an international order, we had many opportunities to go to scheduled events with other Jewish men from different cities. At these conventions, there were planned basketball tournaments during which I had the opportunity to play a lot!! While to most people this simply seems I am overstating my enjoyment. But, to my Jewish friends who, because of their lack of coordination and athleticism, do not get the chance to play regularly, this convention could not have been more opportune. <br/>Though the extended visits and the basketball games are all perks of being Jewish, there have been deeper significances and even some major setbacks to my minority status.<br/>For one, the Jewish community is the strongest community that I have ever felt a part of. The fact that everyone is a recognized minority in every region of the United States makes each member’s presence special and much appreciated. Therefore, no matter someone’s monetary or family conditions, the Jewish community always opens the door for its members. The reason why I value the Jewish community so much is because it offers me a connection that I cannot find at school. Though my friends are very supportive, they will never understand the rituals of holidays or the practices during times of sadness like mourning. While mourning seems like a devastating time period to go through, Jewish law actually makes it very manageable to handle. At daily services, a ritual prayer is said for those undergoing a period of mourning. However, this cannot be said alone. Rather ten members of the community must be present and rise during the prayer because it offers support to the inflicted individual. When my grandmother passed away, my dad practiced this ritual every day for the customary year following the death. I felt a rejuvenating warmth because of my community’s willingness to support my family in our time of need, a feeling that only my religion can offer. <br/>But, it would be foolish for me to ignore the challenges that I have faced through my Judaism. There is one story that I will never forget. During my freshman year when I still thought that I had a chance of being athletic, I was on my school’s rowing team. And there was this one kid who thought that it would be funny to make fun of me in general and then to target my religion as a whole. Given that everyone around me predominantly white and Christian, I thought that I would just get made fun of more if I directly told the kid that I was offended and hurt by his comments. But then one time it really hit a low point. He told me that you think you are so special because of the holocaust. I don’t care whether he thought that this was funny or that it had no significance because it still stung within me. But, I told no one other than my parents for fear that it would only result in more harmful jokes.<br/>His “joke” really rang in me because my grandfather actually escaped the Holocaust. In 1937, he was living in Lithuania. The antisemitism was not only worst in Lithuania than all of the other countries, but also increased gradually as time progressed. His family of five applied for visas. And then they waited. They waited and waited and were denied access to them for years. Finally, in 1940, they were granted access to leave the country. In the summer of 1941, the Lithuanians themselves began to turn their own neighbors into the Nazis and take violent actions against their own residents. He was fortunate to get out of the country prior to the devastation but his journey was not over. He still had to ride through Nazi run Italy and then right under the nose of his executioners in Germany. But, he fortunately reached Portugal and quickly got on a boat that allowed him to come to America. Once he reached America, he was lucky enough that his extended family could provide the expenses for him to move directly to Memphis, Tennessee. He couldn’t speak the language let alone acclimate to the culture. He was not deterred. He was motivated to succeed in his academic adventures and he did. He finished as the valedictorian of his high school class and went on to become a doctor for over fifty years. Though he ended up living a stable life because of his advanced education, he never would have reached this level had it not been for his motivation. In other words, anything is possible for anyone as long as he or she has the desire to prevail.&nbsp;</p><p>The status quo is filled with pain-centered research.
