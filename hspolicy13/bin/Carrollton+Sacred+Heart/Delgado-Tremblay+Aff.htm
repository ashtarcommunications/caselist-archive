A question that calls to mind what it means to originate from an island from which you cannot return. To ask “why are you still Cuban” is to ask me what is “Cuba” and it is here that the historical relationship between the US and Cuba must be examined. De los Angeles explains this beginning in 1999<br/>de los Angeles Torres, Professor Latin American Studies at University of Illinois, ’99 (Maria, “In the Land of Mirrors: Cuban Exile Politics in the United States” University of Michigan Press)<br/>My Continued Quest for Coherence: Politics and Identity For years to talk about xenophobia <br/>AND<br/>searching for coherence, to begin reconciling with our enemies—and ourselves.<br/>Current debates about Cuba are too simplistic.

For me, a member of the Cuban diaspora, the answer is not so simple. To escape persecution, my family fled Cuba listening to both cheers from family and sneered accusations of betrayal. My parents vow they won’t return until they see the end of the regime. The current dichotomy can only be ruptured by realizing identity is more complex than the binary that currently holds the Cuban diaspora’s identity hostage<br/>de los Angeles Torres, Professor Latin American Studies at University of Illinois, ’99 (Maria, “In the Land of Mirrors: Cuban Exile Politics in the United States” University of Michigan Press)<br/>Despite these new barriers, I continue to travel to the island when I can<br/>AND<br/>political, and emotional spaces in which my dual identities can be joined.<br/>This outweighs – the search for the Cuban identity allowed a rediscovery of who we are which allows constructive relationships with the Other<br/>Hall, Professor Sociology at Open University, ’90 (Stuart, “Cultural Identity and Diaspora” pub in ‘Colonial Discourse and Postcolonial Theory: A Reader’ by Williams, Patrick and Laura Chrisman, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.unipa.it/~michele.cometa/hall_cultural_identity.pdf)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.unipa.it/~michele.cometa/hall_cultural_identity.pdf)%27" tppabs="http://www.unipa.it/~michele.cometa/hall_cultural_identity.pdf)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.unipa.it/~michele.cometa/hall_cultural_identity.pdf)</span></a></span><br/>There is, however, a second, related but different view of cultural identity<br/>AND<br/>, of the metropolitan world - always 'South' to someone else's El Norte.</p><p>Advocacy<br/>Voting aff is to endorse the desirability of a bridge connecting the Cuba of Miami to the Cuba of Havana. <br/>Sullivan 13 – Specialist in Latin American Affairs (Mark P.

For example<br/>AND<br/>order to expand categories of travel to Cuba or lift travel restrictions altogether.<br/>Solvency<br/>The bridge we advocate is not literal, but the travel we endorse is. Lifting restrictions that prevent the Cuban diaspora in the US from being able to travel back to Cuba helps address the (dis)engagement that currently persists. A better understanding of my past exposes the contradictions of the current binary of politically extreme choices because the Cuban identity lies in both my home state of Cuba and my host state here in the US. It is only through this fusion that the Cuban diaspora can discover who we truly are.<br/>Duany, Professor Anthro at University of Puerto Rico, ’97 (Jorge, January, “From the Cuban Ajiaco to the Cuban-American Hyphen: Changing Discourses of National Identity on the Island and in the Diaspora” Cuba Studies Association Occasional Papers)<br/>Behar and Leon's compilation contains numerous transnational narratives tracing the construction and reconstruction of Cuban <br/>AND<br/>heart of Miami, just as Miami lives in the heart of Cuba.<br/>I know there may be a Cuban home for me in Miami and there may be a Cuban home for me in Havana.

L. Rev. 205, HeinOnline)<br/>Cubans are nothing if not bordered. Cubans on the island are not free to <br/>AND<br/>, and crossing one can be seen as tantamount to crossing the other.<br/>Diasporic travel back to Cuba serves as a form of reconciliation that refuses to accept the bipolar narratives that currently characterize our identity. In addition to giving the Cuban diaspora a sense of who they are, this helps dismantle current structures of Euroheteropatriarchy by reclaiming our voice from current ideologies of oppression that claim to speak for us<br/>Valdes, Professor Law at University of Miami, ‘3 (Francisco- Director Center for Hispanic and Caribbean Legal Studies, “Diaspora and Deadlock, Miami and Havana: Coming to Terms with Dreams and Dogmas” Florida Law Review, 55 Fla.

First, by issuing financial support in the form of loans, ¶ guarantees, risk insurance, and financing to product exporters and project developers, it has ¶ directly facilitated the building of power plants, the development of oilfields, and the ¶ operations of several cement factories. Ninety-eight percent of its energy portfolio financing ¶ goes to fossil-fuel based nonrenewable energy projects, the results of which are significant ¶ levels of carbon-dioxide emissions. ¶ The Bank itself reports that the amount of CO2¶ from projects that it supports will reach 425 million tonnes per year by 2012, with its contribution to global CO2¶ production ¶ peaking at 1.4 per year, according to its assumptions.127 Even though the 425 million ¶ tonnes estimate is conservative because it excludes emissions resulting from capital industrial ¶ projects and oil and gas extraction projects that also emit heavily, it remains significant.128¶ Many countries with lower levels of emissions have adopted programs to reduce their GHG ¶ emissions, including most of the countries in the European Union.129¶ The Bank claims that the projects it supports would have gone forward even if it had ¶ withheld financing. This claim requires that either other ECAs or private banks would have ¶ financed the projects; if the latter, then the Bank’s current energy financing practices violate¶ its stated claim to fill in financing gaps.130 But even if other ECAs would have otherwise ¶ financed the Bank’s projects, the Bank itself is responsible for the projects in its portfolio ¶ and thus bears responsibility for the continued operations of its GHG-emitting projects. ¶ Second, a lending policy that exports old technology to countries just beginning to ¶ develop their infrastructure sets back the future implementation of more carbon-efficient ¶ technology. The Bank’s heavy support of fossil-fuel combusting power and industrial ¶ projects both takes support away from the renewable energy sector and establishes longlasting infrastructure that will continue to rely on GHG-emitting technology. This slows ¶ down efforts to reduce GHG emissions: the opportunity cost of supporting nonrenewable, ¶ fossil-fuel based energy projects is the support of renewable technology. Because 98 of ¶ power-sector projects receiving support are from fossil-fuel sources, very little is being ¶ directed towards renewable energy projects. ¶ Third, when developed-country ECAs, such as the Bank, finance fossil-fuel ¶ technologies in developing countries, they weaken opportunities for multilateral agreements ¶ which might reduce carbon dioxide emissions. During the Kyoto negotiations, the U.S. and ¶ other developed nations asked for commitments on the part of developing countries to ¶ address GHG emissions. The United States Congress even justified its stance on Kyoto by ¶ declaring that it would not take part in a GHG reductions plan that did not include ¶ developing countries in binding commitments.131 At the same time, the ECAs of developed ¶ countries continue to “facilitate energy-intensive development” and act counter to their¶ nations’ public stances that advocate the reduction of emissions.132¶ This kind of policy inconsistency undermines the credibility of developed-nation ¶ representatives who seek to negotiate GHG emissions reductions agreements and undercuts ¶ the current progress being made to help developing countries adopt renewable energy and ¶ energy efficiency technologies. Because the financial flows directed by ECAs are so vast, the ¶ small efforts such as the Global Environment Facility (GEF) of the U.N. Framework ¶ Convention on Climate Change are effectively negated.133 A lack of developed-nation ¶ credibility and the overwhelming of current renewable energy technology transfer programs ¶ could then pose significant barriers to the developing nations’ participation in, and assent to, ¶ future multilateral agreements to reduce GHG<br/>Certainty is key to Ex Im<br/>Gong 6 – JD @ Berkeley, BA @ Princeton<br/>(Karis Anne, “EXPORTING SUSTAINABILITY: A proposal to reduce the climate impact of the Export?Import Bank of the United States,” <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.princeton.edu/~mauzeral/wws402d_s06/FinalDraftKarisGong.pdf)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.princeton.edu/~mauzeral/wws402d_s06/FinalDraftKarisGong.pdf)%27" tppabs="http://www.princeton.edu/~mauzeral/wws402d_s06/FinalDraftKarisGong.pdf)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.princeton.edu/~mauzeral/wws402d_s06/FinalDraftKarisGong.pdf)</span></a></span><br/>The observed dependency on the PTC to stimulate wind energy installation reveals ¶ the role <br/>AND<br/>instilling a sense of stability ¶ that would decrease their perception of risk.<br/>Uncertainty causes investment flight<br/>Felix 13 - coordinator of the Climate Change and Renewable Energy Practice in Mexico for Baker and McKenzie <br/>(Raul, “Assessing the Impact of Mexico's Biofuels Law,” Last Updated date, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://biomassmagazine.com/articles/1678/assessing-the-impact-of-mexico\%27s-biofuels-law)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://biomassmagazine.com/articles/1678/assessing-the-impact-of-mexico\%27s-biofuels-law)%27" tppabs="http://biomassmagazine.com/articles/1678/assessing-the-impact-of-mexico%27s-biofuels-law)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://biomassmagazine.com/articles/1678/assessing-the-impact-of-mexico's-biofuels-law)</span></a></span><br/>Although Mexico has yet to participate in large-scale biofuels projects, there is <br/>AND<br/>makers-instability that could cause certain investments to flee to other countries. <br/>Certainty is key to next-generation biofuels<br/>Mazza 7 – Research Director for Climate Solutions<br/>(Patrick, “Biofuels Market Breakthrough Opens Way to Cellulosic Fuels Revolution,” <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://climatesolutions.org/resources/reports/sustainable-biofuels/TheCellulosicRevolution.pdf  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://climatesolutions.org/resources/reports/sustainable-biofuels/TheCellulosicRevolution.pdf%27" tppabs="http://climatesolutions.org/resources/reports/sustainable-biofuels/TheCellulosicRevolution.pdf"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://climatesolutions.org/resources/reports/sustainable-biofuels/TheCellulosicRevolution.pdf</span></a></span><br/>Beyond that point, it is generally agreed, biofuels growth will depend on new <br/>AND<br/>the strong political constituencies ¶ required to move ethanol to the next stage.<br/>Uncertainty prevents commercial spillover – no commercialization of greentech<br/>Anadon et. al. 10 – Associate Director of Science, Technology, and Public Policy Program and Director of the Energy Technology Innovation Policy research group;

Policy ¶ measures include minimum renewable fuel usage requirements, blending and production tax ¶ credits, an import tariff, loans and loan guarantees, and research grants. One of the more ¶ prominent forms of federal policy support is the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS)—whereby a ¶ minimum volume of biofuels is to be used in the national transportation fuel supply each year. ¶ This report describes the general nature of the RFS mandate and its implementation, and outlines ¶ some emerging issues related to the continued growth of U.S. biofuels production needed to ¶ fulfill the expanding RFS mandate, as well as the emergence of potential unintended ¶ consequences of this rapid expansion. ¶ Congress first established the RFS with the enactment of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct, ¶ P.L. 109-58). This initial RFS (referred to as RFS1) mandated that a minimum of 4 billion gallons ¶ be used in 2006, rising to 7.5 billion gallons by 2012. Two years later, the Energy Independence ¶ and Security Act of 2007 (EISA, P.L. 110-140) greatly expanded the biofuel mandate volumes ¶ and extended the date through 2022. The expanded RFS (referred to as RFS2) required the annual ¶ use of 9 billion gallons of biofuels in 2008, rising to 36 billion gallons in 2022, with at least 16 ¶ billion gallons from cellulosic biofuels, and a cap of 15 billion gallons for corn-starch ethanol. ¶ In addition to the expanded volumes and extended date, RFS2 has three important distinctions ¶ from RFS1. First, the total renewable fuel requirement is divided into four separate, but nested ¶ categories—total renewable fuels, advanced biofuels, biomass-based diesel, and cellulosic ¶ biofuels—each with its own volume requirement. Second, biofuels qualifying under each ¶ category must achieve certain minimum thresholds of lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emission ¶ reductions, with certain exceptions applicable to existing facilities. Third, all renewable fuel must ¶ be made from feedstocks that meet an amended definition of renewable biomass, including ¶ certain land use restrictions.<br/>Environmental regulations check<br/>Gonzalex and Vera 6 - *George, JD, Bracewell and Giuliani, <strong>Manuel, JD, Bracewell and Giuliani<br/>(“Renewable energy in Mexico: Opportunity for mutual benefit,” <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.bizjournals.com/houston/stories/2006/09/11/focus2.html?page=all)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.bizjournals.com/houston/stories/2006/09/11/focus2.html?page=all)%27" tppabs="http://www.bizjournals.com/houston/stories/2006/09/11/focus2.html?page=all)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.bizjournals.com/houston/stories/2006/09/11/focus2.html?page=all)</span></a></span><br/>Renewable energy projects in Mexico represent a significant growth opportunity for U.S. companies, an innovative strategy for Mexican economic development and a substantial benefit for the environmental quality of both countries.¶ In the past two decades, Mexico has made tremendous strides toward improving its environmental quality and preserving its natural resource base, and, unlike the United States, in 2000 the country ratified the Kyoto Protocol. However, Mexico's rapidly growing population and economy, in addition to the obligations arising from Mexico's accession to the Kyoto Protocol, mean that environmental concerns remain a challenge.¶ Much of the discussion concerning such challenges centers on the North American Free Trade Agreement, which mandates that Mexico raise its environmental protection standards to those in the United States. NAFTA also provides business incentives and investment vehicles that, when combined with potential funding available through certain government sponsored programs, make renewable energy projects a viable way to achieve environmental goals.<br/>Corn ethanol exacerbates negative environmental impacts<br/>UCS 11 - Science-based nonprofit working for a healthy environment and a safer world<br/>(Union of Concerned Scientists, “Corn Ethanol’s Threat to Water Resources,” <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/clean_energy/ew3/corn-ethanol-and-water-quality.pdf)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/clean_energy/ew3/corn-ethanol-and-water-quality.pdf)%27" tppabs="http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/clean_energy/ew3/corn-ethanol-and-water-quality.pdf)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/clean_energy/ew3/corn-ethanol-and-water-quality.pdf)</span></a></span><br/>Corn’s Role in Climate Change¶ The heavy use of nitrogen fertilizer ¶ associated with agriculture in general, ¶ and corn production in particular, ¶ is a significant source of the heattrapping emissions responsible for ¶ global warming (Smith et al. 2007). ¶ In addition to the direct impact corn ¶ production has on our climate, the ¶ expanded use of corn for ethanol ¶ production has an indirect impact on ¶ land use globally, which exacerbates ¶ the problem (ERS 2011c). As forested ¶ land around the world is converted ¶ to agriculture in order to meet the ¶ increasing demand for food and fuel ¶ crops (West 2010), the trees that are ¶ cut down represent a potentially very ¶ large source of heat-trapping emissions (though the exact amount is ¶ difficult to project with a high degree ¶ of certainty) (Plevin et al. 2010).¶ The impacts of high ethanol ¶ demand¶ More intensive corn production.¶ Corn production has been increasing ¶ rapidly in recent years due primarily ¶ to the demand for ethanol (Figure 3). ¶ More demand for corn ethanol means ¶ higher prices for corn, which translates into changes in agricultural ¶ practices. For example, the cornsoybean rotations that were typical in ¶ the Corn Belt have given way to more ¶ intensive corn production, with either ¶ two years of corn between soybean ¶ plantings, or continuous corn (Secchi ¶ et al. 2009). More intensive corn ¶ production means higher rates of¶ fertilizer application and, with it, the ¶ potential for higher losses of nitrogen ¶ and phosphorus into ground and ¶ surface waters and, ultimately, the ¶ Mississippi River and Gulf of Mexico ¶ (Helmers et al. 2011; Secchi et al. ¶ 2011; Donner and Kucharik 2008).¶ Higher corn prices also lead to ¶ corn being planted on highly erodible ¶ and marginally productive land that ¶ had been set aside for natural vegetation under the federal Conservation ¶ Reserve Program for the past 10 years ¶ or more. Bringing this land back into ¶ production has a significantly negative ¶ impact on erosion, soil carbon, and ¶ wildlife habitat (Secchi et al. 2009).¶ Even after the corn has been ¶ processed into ethanol, the problems ¶ associated with excess nitrogen and ¶ phosphorus remain. Only the starch ¶ in the corn kernel is converted into ¶ fuel, leaving behind the fiber, protein, ¶ and nutrients—a product called distillers grains that is fed to livestock, ¶ poultry, and fish. Because the act of ¶ removing the starch concentrates the ¶ nutrients in this animal feed compared with whole corn, the animals’ ¶ manure will be phosphorus-rich ¶ and, if used as fertilizer, will further ¶ increase phosphorus pollution in surface waters (Simpson et al. 2008).</strong></p></div></div></td><td>3/1/14</td></tr><tr><td style="width:100%; word-break:break-all; word-break:break-word;"><div><p><input onclick="saveEntry(9)" src="../../xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" tppabs="http://hspolicy13.debatecoaches.org/xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" style="float:right;" title="Save" type="image" value="Save"></input>

Proquest) <br/>As a result, the most important political questions are simply not asked. It is assumed that U.S. military intervention is an act of "aggression," but no consideration is given to the aggression to which intervention is a response. The status quo ante in Afghanistan is not, as peace activists would have it, peace, but rather terrorist violence abetted by a regime--the Taliban--that rose to power through brutality and repression. This requires us to ask a question that most "peace" activists would prefer not to ask: What should be done to respond to the violence of a Saddam Hussein, or a Milosevic, or a Taliban regime? What means are likely to stop violence and bring criminals to justice? Calls for diplomacy and international law are well intended and important; they implicate a decent and civilized ethic of global order. But they are also vague and empty, because they are not accompanied by any account of how diplomacy or international law can work effectively to address the problem at hand. The campus left offers no such account. To do so would require it to contemplate tragic choices in which moral goodness is of limited utility. Here what matters is not purity of intention but the intelligent exercise of power. Power is not a dirty word or an unfortunate feature of the world. It is the core of politics. Power is the ability to effect outcomes in the world. Politics, in large part, involves contests over the distribution and use of power. To accomplish anything in the political world, one must attend to the means that are necessary to bring it about. And to develop such means is to develop, and to exercise, power. To say this is not to say that power is beyond morality. It is to say that power is not reducible to morality. As writers such as Niccolo Machiavelli, Max Weber, Reinhold Niebuhr, and Hannah Arendt have taught, an unyielding concern with moral goodness undercuts political responsibility. The concern may be morally laudable, reflecting a kind of personal integrity, but it suffers from three fatal flaws: (1) It fails to see that the purity of one's intention does not ensure the achievement of what one intends. Abjuring violence or refusing to make common cause with morally compromised parties may seem like the right thing; but if such tactics entail impotence, then it is hard to view them as serving any moral good beyond the clean conscience of their supporters; (2) it fails to see that in a world of real violence and injustice, moral purity is not simply a form of powerlessness; it is often a form of complicity in injustice. This is why, from the standpoint of politics--as opposed to religion--pacifism is always a potentially immoral stand. In categorically repudiating violence, it refuses in principle to oppose certain violent injustices with any effect; and (3) it fails to see that politics is as much about unintended consequences as it is about intentions; it is the effects of action, rather than the motives of action, that is most significant. Just as the alignment with "good" may engender impotence, it is often the pursuit of "good" that generates evil. This is the lesson of communism in the twentieth century: it is not enough that one's goals be sincere or idealistic; it is equally important, always, to ask about the effects of pursuing these goals and to judge these effects in pragmatic and historically contextualized ways. Moral absolutism inhibits this judgment. It alienates those who are not true believers. It promotes arrogance. And it undermines political effectiveness.</p><p>Their evidence describes authoritarian societies – genocide can't happen in a democracy, and if it does, it wouldn't escalate<br/>Economics and past interventions limit intervention<br/>Ben Ami, VP of Toledo International Centre for Peace, ’11 (Shlomo, July 1, “Arab Spring, Western Fall” Project Syndicate, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/benami55/English)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/benami55/English)%27" tppabs="http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/benami55/English)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/benami55/English)</span></a></span><br/>The old vocation of what Rudyard Kipling called the “White Man’s Burden” – the driving idea behind the West’s quest for global hegemony from the days of imperial expansion in the nineteenth century to the current, pathetically inconclusive, Libyan intervention – has clearly run out of steam. Politically and economically exhausted, and attentive to electorates clamoring for a shift of priorities to urgent domestic concerns, Europe and America are no longer very capable of imposing their values and interests through costly military interventions in faraway lands. US Secretary of Defense Robert Gates was stating the obvious when he recently lambasted NATO’s European members for their lukewarm response to the alliance’s missions, and for their poor military capabilities. (Ten weeks into the fighting in Libya, the Europeans were already running out of munitions.) He warned that if Europe’s attitude to NATO did not change, the Alliance would degenerate into “collective military irrelevance.” Europe’s reluctance to participate in military endeavors should not come as a revelation. The Old Continent has been immersed since World War II in a “post-historical” discourse that rules out the use of force as a way to resolve conflicts, let alone to bring about regime change. And now it is engaged in a fateful struggle to secure the very existence and viability of the European Union. As a result, Europe is retreating into a narrow regional outlook – and assuming that America will carry the burden of major global issues. But America itself is reconsidering its priorities. These are trying economic times for the US, largely owing to imperial overstretch financed by Chinese credit. Admiral Mike Mullen, the US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, recently defined America’s colossal fiscal deficits as the biggest threat to its national security. Indeed, at a time of painful budget cuts – the US is facing a $52 trillion shortfall on public pensions and health care in the coming decades – the US can no longer be expected to maintain its current level of global military engagement. But the fiscal crisis is not the whole story. The dire lessons of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan will shape future debate about America’s international role in the twenty-first century. At an address in February to cadets at the US Military Academy at West Point, Gates said that “any future defense secretary who advises the president to send a big American land army into Asia or into the Middle East or Africa should have his head examined.” Gates’s recent statements are by no means those of a lonely isolationist in an otherwise interventionist America. He expressed a widely perceived imperative for strategic reassessment. In 1947, in a landmark article, “The Sources of Soviet Conduct,” which he signed as “X,” George Kennan defined America’s foreign-policy strategy for the Cold War as one of containment and deterrence. It is difficult to imagine a more marked departure from Kennan’s concepts than a report recently released by the Pentagon – A National Strategic Narrative – authored by two active-duty military officers who signed as “Y.” The report can be dismissed as just the musings of two senior members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff writing in their “personal capacity.” But its real power stems from the degree to which it reflects America’s mood in an era of declining global influence and diminishing expectations regarding the relevance of military power to sustaining US global hegemony. Just as Kennan’s “X” article was fully reflective of the mood in America at the time, so the Narrative expresses the current American Zeitgeist. Thus, the idea that “Y” might turn out to be a latter-day “X” – defining the nature of America’s international role in the twenty-first century – may not be far-fetched. Conspicuously, there is much in the Narrative that coincides with Europe’s emphasis on soft power. The authors call for a shift from outdated Cold War strategies of “power and control” to one of civic engagement and sustainable prosperity. Security, they maintain, means more than defense. It means engagement whereby America should not seek “to bully, intimidate, cajole, or persuade others to accept our unique values or to share our national objectives.” America, “Y” argues, must first put its own house in order if it is to recover credible global influence as a beacon of prosperity and justice. This would require improving America’s diplomatic capabilities, as well as regaining international competitiveness through greater investment in education and infrastructure at home. The message emanating now from the US is not one of non-interventionism, but a strategy of restraint that assumes that there are limits to American power and seeks to minimize the risk of entanglement in foreign conflicts. As Gates put it in his West Point address, the US Army would no longer be “a Victorian nation-building constabulary designed to chase guerrillas, build schools, or sip tea.”<br/>US economic collapse causes the rise of transnational MNC’s – bigger internal link to biopolitical exploitation<br/>McCoy, History Prof at Wisconsin-Madison, ’10 (Alfred, December 6, “The Decline and Fall of the American Empire Four Scenarios for the End of the American Century by 2025” TomDispatch, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.commondreams.org/view/2010/12/06-1)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.commondreams.org/view/2010/12/06-1)%27" tppabs="http://www.commondreams.org/view/2010/12/06-1)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.commondreams.org/view/2010/12/06-1)</span></a></span><br/>Complicating matters even more, the economic, military, and technological trends outlined above will not operate in tidy isolation. As happened to European empires after World War II, such negative forces will undoubtedly prove synergistic. They will combine in thoroughly unexpected ways, create crises for which Americans are remarkably unprepared, and threaten to spin the economy into a sudden downward spiral, consigning this country to a generation or more of economic misery. As U.S. power recedes, the past offers a spectrum of possibilities for a future world order. At one end of this spectrum, the rise of a new global superpower, however unlikely, cannot be ruled out. Yet both China and Russia evince self-referential cultures, recondite non-roman scripts, regional defense strategies, and underdeveloped legal systems, denying them key instruments for global dominion. At the moment then, no single superpower seems to be on the horizon likely to succeed the U.S. In a dark, dystopian version of our global future, a coalition of transnational corporations, multilateral forces like NATO, and an international financial elite could conceivably forge a single, possibly unstable, supra-national nexus that would make it no longer meaningful to speak of national empires at all. While denationalized corporations and multinational elites would assumedly rule such a world from secure urban enclaves, the multitudes would be relegated to urban and rural wastelands. In Planet of Slums, Mike Davis offers at least a partial vision of such a world from the bottom up. He argues that the billion people already packed into fetid favela-style slums worldwide (rising to two billion by 2030) will make “the 'feral, failed cities' of the Third World… the distinctive battlespace of the twenty-first century.” As darkness settles over some future super-favela, “the empire can deploy Orwellian technologies of repression” as “hornet-like helicopter gun-ships stalk enigmatic enemies in the narrow streets of the slum districts… Every morning the slums reply with suicide bombers and eloquent explosions.”<br/>Survival guarantees value to life – it is only devalued when we assume biopower can devalue it<br/>Fassin, Professor Social Science Princeton, ’10 (Didier, Fall, “Ethics of Survival: A Democratic Approach to the Politics of Life” Humanity: An International Journal of Human Rights, Humanitarianism, and Development, Vol 1 No 1, Project Muse)<br/>&nbsp;“Long before the experience of survival that I am presently facing, I wrote that survival is an original concept which constitutes the very structure of what we call existence. We are, structurally speaking, survivors, marked by this structure of the trace, of the testament. That said, I would not endorse the view according to which survival is more on the side of death and the past than of life and the future. No, deconstruction is always on the side of the affirmation of life.”3 A few weeks before his death, Jacques Derrida gave his last interview in which he developed at length his conception of life as survival. Suffering from a terminal disease, he confided: “Since certain health problems are becoming more pressing, the question of survival and reprieve, which has always haunted me, literally, every moment of my life, in a concrete and tireless way, takes on a different color today.” In reference to a sentence he had used in one of his books (“I would finally like to know how to live”) he End Page 81 commented with a penetrating irony: “No, I never learned to live. Definitely not! Learning to live should mean learning to die. I never learned to accept death. I remain impervious to being educated in the wisdom of knowing how to die.” However, beyond the emergency of this “shrinking time of reprieve” (which he rejected with humor, saying, “we are not here for a health bulletin”), it is the more general problem of survival on which the philosopher wanted to meditate: “I have always been interested in the question of survival, the meaning of which does not add to life and death. It is originary: life is survival.” In fact, both dimensions were for him intimately related, the personal experience repeating the existential experience, the circumstantial ordeal making the structural reality more evident and more painful. How else to understand that on the verge of death, thinking about survival could become so insistent in this interview, until the final profession of faith? “Everything I say about survival as a complication of the opposition between life and death proceeds from an unconditional affirmation of life. Survival is life beyond life, life more than life, and the discourse I undertake is not about death. On the contrary, it is the affirmation of a living being who prefers life and therefore survival to death, because survival is not simply what remains; it is the most intense life possible.” I want to show that Derrida’s conception of life as survival, in its polysemy and even its ambiguity, may offer an alternative to conceptions of life which, from Benjamin to Agamben, and in a quite different perspective, from Lamarck to Canguilhem, have presented a seductive dualistic framework for the humanities and social sciences. Both visions are inherited from Aristotle. On the one hand, life is presented as biopolitical fact: “Behind the long strife-ridden process that leads to the recognition of rights and formal liberties stands the body of the sacred man with his double sovereign, his life that cannot be sacrificed yet may be killed,” affirms Giorgio Agamben in Homo Sacer, where he develops his theory of “bare life.”4 From the “politicization of life” in totalitarian systems to the “isolation of the sacred life” in contemporary democracies, he therefore establishes a continuum of the power over life. On the other hand, life is conceived as a biological phenomenon: “any datum of experience possible to trace as a history comprised between its birth and its death is living, is the object of biological knowledge,” writes Georges Canguilhem for the entry “Life” in the Encyclopedia Universalis.5 He presents life successively as “animation,” “mechanism,” “organization,” and “information,” in a chronological review of biological theories extending from ancient conceptions to contemporary genetics—and everyone knows that the genome is often said to be the “code of life.” In other words, these two readings present life as what can be put to death (for Agamben), and as what is comprised from birth to death (for Canguilhem). The social sciences have largely drawn from these two repertoires: the former has been used to comprehend the government of populations and human beings; the latter has nourished the sociology and anthropology of sciences and techniques. However different they may be, these two models rest on the same premises. Both treat life as a physical phenomenon, whether it is “bare life” or “biological life” (both philosophers insisting that it is the dimension shared with the entire animal kingdom). And both assume that life can be separated, for scientific or political reasons, from life as an existential phenomenon, whether it is called “qualified life” or “lived experience” (by Agamben End Page 82 and Canguilhem respectively).6 It seems to me that Derrida’s reflection shatters this distinction: “survival” mixes inextricably physical life, threatened by his cancer, and existential experience, expressed in his work. To survive is to be still fully alive and to live beyond death. It is the “unconditional affirmation” of life and the pleasure of living, and it is the hope of “surviving” through the traces left for the living. There is, I believe, in this revelation much more than the last testimony of a philosopher who did not accustom us to such clarity and simplicity. I see it as an ethical gesture through which life is rehabilitated in its most obvious and most ordinary dimension—life which has death for horizon but which is not separated from life as a social form, inscribed in a history, a culture, an experience. I consider the consequences of this gesture to be decisive for the humanities and social sciences: or so I want to argue here. Too often, in recent years, anthropologists and sociologists have tended, under the influence of the philosophical conceptions of life presented above, to take for granted the distinction between the forms of life they affirm—qualified life versus bare life or physical existence versus existential experience. Indeed this reductionism, when it is employed in the study of biological sciences, is fully justified, although its definition of life often seems hegemonic, or at least forgetful of other possibilities: some even speak of “life itself.” Conversely, when it is applied to the study of human government, it generally has the effect of disqualifying as inferior the lives of individuals or groups that society appears to reduce to their condition of “bare life”: refugees, excluded, marginalized, sick. Having been myself receptive to this dualism, and still sympathetic to the philosophers who proposed it, but also having observed among many colleagues and students the attraction exerted by this paradigm of bare life, I am sensitive not only to the intellectual risk but also to the ethical danger represented by its indiscriminate use in the humanities and social sciences. This is why I will concentrate my critical analysis on the biopolitical rather than biological reading of life. <br/>Biopower is inevitable.

In 1979, guerrilla opposition forces started to threaten the government of Afghanistan. The Soviets interfered trying to end the conflict, but instead, the conflict led to the Afghan War which lasted ten years, taking an enormous human and economic toll. Only after the Soviet withdrawal could the Afghan people take control of their government. The Soviets let the Afghan people take care of it themselves. It so happened to be that when the Soviets lifted their biopower, the Taliban seized control of the government and exerted far greater biopower than before. The truth is, however, that lifting a biopolitical constraint is an endless process. Foucault himself states the fact that it is impossible to be in a world without biopower, because as soon as a constraint has been lifted, another one sets into place. Foucault uses the historical example of the French revolution and how the French overthrew their government, a constraint that led to their suffering at the time, but then had to face a new governmental power. The power structures circulate if individualism is preserved, and that, Foucault explains, is the sole priority of a society: to ensure that it does circulate. As soon we try to infringe on a constraint and use power to limit it, we are stopping this cycle, only increasing biopower within the constraint itself.</p></div></div></td><td>2/17/14</td></tr><tr><td style="width:100%; word-break:break-all; word-break:break-word;"><div><p><input onclick="saveEntry(17)" src="../../xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" tppabs="http://hspolicy13.debatecoaches.org/xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" style="float:right;" title="Save" type="image" value="Save"></input>

It is a contribution to the longstanding ambition of depth psychology to develop a form of political and cultural analysis that will, in Freud's words, ‘understand the riddles of the world’. It has to be admitted that there is an equally longstanding reluctance in the non-psychological community to accept the many and varied ideas and suggestions concerning political matters that have been offered by analysts of all persuasions. I do not believe this can all be put down to resistance. There is something offensive above reductive interpretations of complex socio-political problems in exclusively psychological terms. The tendency to panpsychism on the part of some depth psychologists has led me to wonder if an adequate methodology and ethos actually exists with which to make an engagement of depth psychology with the public sphere possible. &nbsp;By ‘politics’ I mean the arrangements within a culture for the organization and distribution of power, especially economic power, and the way in which power is deployed to maintain the survival and enhance the quality of human life. Economic and political power includes control of processes of information and representation as well as the use of physical force and possession of vital resources such as land, food and water. On a more personal level, political power reflects the ability to choose freely whether to act and what action to take in a given situation. ‘Politics’ refers to the interplay between the personal and public dimensions of power. That is, there is an articulation between public, economic power and power as expressed on the personal, private level. This articulation is demonstrated in family organization, gender and race relations, and in religious and artistic assumptions as they affect the life of individuals. (I have also tried to be consistent in my use of the terms ‘culture’, ‘society’ and ‘collective’.)1 &nbsp;Here is an example of the difficulty with psychological reductionism to which I am referring. At a conference I attended in London in 1990, a distinguished psychoanalyst referred to the revolutionary students in Paris in 1968 as ‘functioning as a regressive group’. Now, for a large group of students to be said to regress, there must be, in the speaker's mind, some sort of normative developmental starting point for them to regress to. The social group is supposed to have a babyhood, as it were. Similarly, the speaker must have had in mind the possibility of a healthier, progressive group process — what a more mature group of revolutionary students would have looked like. But complex social and political phenomena do not conform to the individualistic, chronological, moralistic, pathologizing framework that is often imported. &nbsp;The problem stems from treating the entire culture, or large chunks of it, as if it were an individual or, worse, as if it were a baby. Psychoanalysts project a version of personality development couched in judgemental terms onto a collective cultural and political process. If we look in this manner for pathology in the culture, we will surely find it. As we are looking with a psychological theory in mind, then, lo and behold, the theory will explain the pathology. But this is a retrospective prophecy (to use a phrase of Freud's), twenty—twenty hindsight. In this psychoanalytic tautologizing there is really nothing much to get excited about. Too much psychological writing on the culture, my own included, has suffered from this kind of smug ‘correctness’ when the ‘material’ proves the theoretical point. Of course it does! If we are interested in envy or greed, then we will find envy or greed in capitalistic organization. If we set out to demonstrate the presence of archetypal patterns, such as projection of the shadow, in geopolitical relations, then, without a doubt, they will seem to leap out at us. We influence what we analyse and so psychological reflection on culture and politics needs to be muted; there is not so much ‘aha!’ as one hoped.<br/>Fear leads to threat aversion<br/>Stein 13 – Professor of Political Science and IR @ U of Toronto<br/>Jance, “THREAT PERCEPTION IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS,” The Oxford Handbook of Political Psychology, 2 nd ed.

Cognitive models have long informed the study of deterrence (Jervis, Lebow, and Stein, 1985; Lebow and Stein, 1994) but building emotions in to the explanation is shedding new light on old problems. 35 The credibility of threats, an essential component in theories of deterrence, compellence, and bargaining, is not only a property of the sender, as some formal models of signalling suggest, but also a function of the beliefs of the receiver (Mercer, 2010). And these beliefs are not only cognitive but emotional as well. The emotional cues that signals evoke—fear, anger—matter insofar as these emotions then prompt beliefs and action in turn. Research demonstrates that fear prompts uncertainty and risk-averse action while anger prompts certainty and risk-acceptance. Threats that evoke fear, unless they evoke loss-avoidance, are likely to prompt hesitancy and a riskaverse response; indeed, that is the purpose of most deterrent threats. Frightening threats are less likely to be successful, however, when they are designed to compel adversarial leaders to act.<br/>Overemphasis on psyche fails – ignores materiality and is ahistorical because it ignores other systems of power<br/>Mardorossian 2 – Prof of English @ UNY Buffalo<br/>Carine M , Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society, vol. 27, no. <br/>Ironically, the Foucauldian paradigm, which postmodernists often evoke to buttress their claims, itself helps make visible the reason why making women’s psyche the site of the analysis of rape or of rape prevention is a depoliticizing gesture for feminist politics. As Foucault’s work has shown, the history of the modern subject has been one of depoliticization carried out mostly through the construction of a psychologized and ahistorical subject. In the nineteenth century, medical, legal, religious, and social discourses came together to construct the now naturalized idea of sex as the secret of the individual’s being, thus concealing the “power/ knowledge” involved in creating the notion of sex as essence. Turning the “minor chronicle of sex” and “inconsequential bucolic pleasures” into the prediscursive core of the individual was a successful “ruse” of power that would keep the subject focused on changing the inner self rather than on addressing power relations. A whole system of institutional, cultural, and economic practices and social inequities was obscured when inner transformation was established as the only genuine means of achieving social change. The psychological and inner realm—that is, the individual’s “center”—overrode material considerations. Similarly, Nancy Armstrong’s Foucauldian reading of the history of the novel reveals the domestic novel to have been instrumental in producing the ideal of the modern individual as psychological reality. Written representations of the self replaced the aristocratic ideal of “the family name” with “moral value” and of attractive and opulent surface with psychological and emotional depth. Armstrong (1987) explains that, with its presumptions of naturalness, this new female ideal (which would become the prototype of the modern individual) removed subjectivity and sexuality from their place in political history. Indeed, “to define political resistance in such psychological terms was to remove it from the snarl of competing social and economic interests in which every individual was entangled” (1987, 252). In emphasizing inner life as the source of being and happiness, the middle class could justify social hierarchies in moral rather than economic terms. When postmodern analyses locate rape prevention inside women’s psyches, they ironically replicate modern techniques of power even as they seek to challenge them.</p><p>Turn – traditional security studies incorrectly deflate threats – the affirmative is necessary to reverse this trend<br/>Schweller 4 <br/>Randall L. Schweller, Associate Professor in the Department of Political Science at The Ohio State University, “Unanswered Threats A Neoclassical RealistTheory of Underbalancing,” International Security 29.2 (2004) 159-201, Muse<br/>Despite the historical frequency of underbalancing, little has been written on the subject. Indeed, Geoffrey Blainey's memorable observation that for "every thousand pages published on the causes of wars there is less than one page directly on the causes of peace" could have been made with equal veracity about overreactions to threats as opposed to underreactions to them.92 Library shelves are filled with books on the causes and dangers of exaggerating threats, ranging from studies of domestic politics to bureaucratic politics, to political psychology, to organization theory. By comparison, there have been few studies at any level of analysis or from any theoretical perspective that directly explain why states have with some, if not equal, regularity underestimated dangers to their survival. There may be some cognitive or normative bias at work here. Consider, for instance, that there is a commonly used word, paranoia, for the unwarranted fear that people are, in some way, "out to get you" or are planning to do oneharm. I suspect that just as many people are afflicted with the opposite psychosis: the delusion that everyone loves you when, in fact, they do not even like you. Yet, we do not have a familiar word for this phenomenon. Indeed, I am unaware of any word that describes this pathology (hubris and overconfidence come close, but they plainly define something other than what I have described). That noted, international relations theory does have a frequently used phrase for the pathology of states' underestimation of threats to their survival, the so-called Munich analogy. The term is used, however, in a disparaging way by theorists to ridicule those who employ it. The central claim is that the naïveté associated with Munich and the outbreak of World War II has become an overused and inappropriate analogy because few leaders are as evil and unappeasable as Adolf Hitler. Thus, the analogy either mistakenly causes leaders End Page 198 to adopt hawkish and overly competitive policies or is deliberately used by leaders to justify such policies and mislead the public. A more compelling explanation for the paucity of studies on underreactions to threats, however, is the tendency of theories to reflect contemporary issues as well as the desire of theorists and journals to provide society with policy- relevant theories that may help resolve or manage urgent security problems. Thus, born in the atomic age with its new balance of terror and an ongoing Cold War, the field of security studies has naturally produced theories of and prescriptions for national security that have had little to say about—and are, in fact, heavily biased against warnings of—the dangers of underreacting to or underestimating threats. After all, the nuclear revolution was not about overkill but, as Thomas Schelling pointed out, speed of kill and mutual kill.93 Given the apocalyptic consequences of miscalculation, accidents, or inadvertent nuclear war, small wonder that theorists were more concerned about overreacting to threats than underresponding to them. At a time when all of humankind could be wiped out in less than twenty-five minutes, theorists may be excused for stressing the benefits of caution under conditions of uncertainty and erring on the side of inferring from ambiguous actions overly benign assessments of the opponent's intentions. The overwhelming fear was that a crisis "might unleash forces of an essentially military nature that overwhelm the political process and bring on a war thatnobody wants. Many important conclusions about the risk of nuclear war, and thus about the political meaning of nuclear forces, rest on this fundamental idea."94 Now that the Cold War is over, we can begin to redress these biases in the literature. In that spirit, I have offered a domestic politics model to explain why threatened states often fail to adjust in a prudent and coherent way to dangerous changes in their strategic environment. The model fits nicely with recent realist studies on imperial under- and overstretch. Specifically, it is consistent with Fareed Zakaria's analysis of U.S. foreign policy from 1865 to 1889, when, he claims, the United States had the national power and opportunity to expand but failed to do so because it lacked sufficient state power (i.e., the state was weak relative to society).95 Zakaria claims that the United States did End Page 199 not take advantage of opportunities in its environment to expand because it lacked the institutional state strength to harness resources from society that were needed to do so. I am making a similar argument with respect to balancing rather than expansion: incoherent, fragmented states are unwilling and unable to balance against potentially dangerous threats because elites view the domestic risks as too high, and they are unable to mobilize the required resources from a divided society. The arguments presented here also suggest that elite fragmentation and disagreement within a competitive political process, which Jack Snyder cites as an explanation for overexpansionist policies, are more likely to produce underbalancing than overbalancing behavior among threatened incoherent states.96 This is because a balancing strategy carries certain political costs and risks with few, if any, compensating short-term political gains, and because the strategic environment is always somewhat uncertain. Consequently, logrolling among fragmented elites within threatened states is more likely to generate overly cautious responses to threats than overreactions to them. This dynamic captures the underreaction of democratic states to the rise of Nazi Germany during the interwar period.97 In addition to elite fragmentation, I have suggested some basic domestic-level variables that regularly intervene to thwart balance of power predictions.<br/>US power is comparatively benign<br/>Shaw 2 – Professor of IR @ Sussex<br/>Martin Shaw, professor of international relations at University of Sussex, April 7, Uses and Abuses of Anti-Imperialism in the Global Era, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.martinshaw.org/empire.htm  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.martinshaw.org/empire.htm%27" tppabs="http://www.martinshaw.org/empire.htm"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.martinshaw.org/empire.htm</span></a></span><br/>It is fashionable in some circles, among which we must clearly include the organizers of this conference, to argue that the global era is seeing 'a new imperialism' - that can be blamed for the problem of 'failed states' (probably among many others). Different contributors to this strand of thought name this imperialism in different ways, but novelty is clearly a critical issue. The logic of using the term imperialism is actually to establish continuity between contemporary forms of Western world power and older forms first so named by Marxist and other theorists a century ago. The last thing that critics of a new imperialism wish to allow is that Western power has changed sufficiently to invalidate the very application of this critical concept. Nor have many considered the possibility that if the concept of imperialism has a relevance today, it applies to certain aggressive, authoritarian regimes of the non-Western world rather than to the contemporary West. &nbsp;In this paper I fully accept that there is a concentration of much world power - economic, cultural, political and military - in the hands of Western elites. In my recent book, Theory of the Global State, I discuss the development of a 'global-Western state conglomerate' (Shaw 2000). I argue that 'global' ideas and institutions, whose significance characterizes the new political era that has opened with the end of the Cold War, depend largely - but not solely - on Western power. I hold no brief and intend no apology for official Western ideas and behaviour. And yet I propose that the idea of a new imperialism is a profoundly misleading, indeed ideological concept that obscures the realities of power and especially of empire in the twenty-first century. This notion is an obstacle to understanding the significance, extent and limits of contemporary Western power. It simultaneously serves to obscure many real causes of oppression, suffering and struggle for transformation against the quasi-imperial power of many regional states. &nbsp;In order to explore the intellectual and political problem that 'a new imperialism' poses it is necessary to do several things. Obviously, we must explore the old imperialism, but before we can do that we must look at the roots of the concept in the idea of empire itself. Indeed, my argument is that the coherence of the concept of 'imperialism' lay partly in its connection with the idea of empire. In analysing imperialism, classic Marxist writers (see Table 1) linked the new economic relations of late nineteenth-century world capitalism to the phenomenon of political empire. Late twentieth-century anti-imperialists have struggled with the problem that modern Western power has almost entirely abandoned formal empire. Hence the idea of neo-imperialism, rooted in economic exploitation buttressed only by indirect political dominance, has already a history of half a century. The problem that these critics have faced is that their chosen concept has become more and more abstracted from the real politics of empire. &nbsp;I argue that in the global era, this separation has finally become critical. This is for two related reasons. On the one hand, Western power has moved into new territory, largely uncharted -- and I argue unchartable -- with the critical tools of anti-imperialism. On the other hand, the politics of empire remain all too real, in classic forms that recall both modern imperialism and earlier empires, in many non-Western states, and they are revived in many political struggles today. Thus the concept of a 'new imperialism' fails to deal with both key post-imperial features of Western power and the quasi-imperial character of many non-Western states. The concept overstates Western power and understates the dangers posed by other, more authoritarian and imperial centres of power. Politically it identifies the West as the principal enemy of the world's people, when for many of them there are far more real and dangerous enemies closer to home.

Some of these existential risks are fairly well known, especially the natural ones. But others are obscure or even exotic. Most worrying to Bostrom is the subset of existential risks that arise from human technology, a subset that he expects to grow in number and potency over the next century.¶ Despite his concerns about the risks posed to humans by technological progress, Bostrom is no luddite. In fact, he is a longtime advocate of transhumanism---the effort to improve the human condition, and even human nature itself, through technological means. In the long run he sees technology as a bridge, a bridge we humans must cross with great care, in order to reach new and better modes of being. In his work, Bostrom uses the tools of philosophy and mathematics, in particular probability theory, to try and determine how we as a species might achieve this safe passage. What follows is my conversation with Bostrom about some of the most interesting and worrying existential risks that humanity might encounter in the decades and centuries to come, and about what we can do to make sure we outlast them.¶ Some have argued that we ought to be directing our resources toward humanity's existing problems, rather than future existential risks, because many of the latter are highly improbable. You have responded by suggesting that existential risk mitigation may in fact be a dominant moral priority over the alleviation of present suffering. Can you explain why? ¶ Bostrom: Well suppose you have a moral view that counts future people as being worth as much as present people. You might say that fundamentally it doesn't matter whether someone exists at the current time or at some future time, just as many people think that from a fundamental moral point of view, it doesn't matter where somebody is spatially---somebody isn't automatically worth less because you move them to the moon or to Africa or something. A human life is a human life. If you have that moral point of view that future generations matter in proportion to their population numbers, then you get this very stark implication that existential risk mitigation has a much higher utility than pretty much anything else that you could do. There are so many people that could come into existence in the future if humanity survives this critical period of time---we might live for billions of years, our descendants might colonize billions of solar systems, and there could be billions and billions times more people than exist currently. Therefore, even a very small reduction in the probability of realizing this enormous good will tend to outweigh even immense benefits like eliminating poverty or curing malaria, which would be tremendous under ordinary standards.<br/>Discourse doesn’t create security, it’s a response to real and material concerns – prefer our threat-specific internal links<br/>Glover 11 – University of Bradford, UK<br/>Nicholas, “Does Security exist outside of the speech act?,” <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.e-ir.info/2011/10/09/does-security-exist-outside-of-the-speech-act/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.e-ir.info/2011/10/09/does-security-exist-outside-of-the-speech-act/%27" tppabs="http://www.e-ir.info/2011/10/09/does-security-exist-outside-of-the-speech-act/"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.e-ir.info/2011/10/09/does-security-exist-outside-of-the-speech-act/</span></a></span><br/>Significant to this theory is Waver’s notion of societal security, which invokes community and identity as key analytical tenets. This concept refers to the presentation of community identity being threatened by dynamics such as population movements (Williams, 2003: 513). The emphasis on threat and societal identity—its’ sense of we-ness—reflects the Copenhagen School’s focus on a particular type of speech act and thus a specific security—one which understands the politics of enmity. The essence of security in this understanding is existential threats and the production of the “other” as a political enemy. Hence, the speech act is a security act and securitisation relies on a specific rhetorical structure which identifies threats, proposes emergency action and effects interunit relations by breaking free of rules (Williams, 2003: 514). Securitisation is structured by the differential capacity of actors to make socially effective claims about threats and accepted as convincing by an audience and by the empirical factors or situation to which these actors can make reference (Williams, 2003: 514). A successful securitising speech act depends on an adherence to the internal linguistic rules of the act and the legitimate positionality of the actor uttering the act. This narrow reading of the construction of security as a designation of threatening ‘others’ and the legitimation of emergency measures (military) by an elite actor, serves to reify the meaning of security and marginalises inclusive and non-statist definitions of values of security understood in particular contexts (McDonald, 2009: 579). For the Copenhagen School, security rests upon a symbiotic relationship between actor and audience. Hence, an issue is securitised when an audience accepts it as such. The significance of the audience in the process of securitisation is neatly encapsulated in the concept of intersubjectivity. A successful securitisation is decided by the audience of the speech act; it is they who must accept that something is an existential threat to a shared value (Buzan et al, 1998: 31). Speaking security does not guarantee success; therefore security rests among the subjects and their willingness to accept legitimacy of the discourse. The central problematic of the speech act theory relates to its’ casting of securitisation merely in terms of this discourse-legitimation-action sequence. Problematically, the classic application of the securitisation framework privileges the role of political leaders in the articulation and designation of threat and locates the logic of security among strategic actors imbued with intentionality. Such an image of strategic actors seeking to label threats as security and therefore justify emergency responses provides a narrow state-centric conception of the construction of security which fails to contextualise the processes involved and tackle the meaning of security. Hence, the Copenhagen School’s framework of securitisation focus overwhelmingly on the performative role of the speech act rather than the conditions in which securitisation itself becomes possible (Buzan and Waever, 2003: 72). Whilst alluding to the intersubjective nature of security, the focus on the speech act as performing security defines security less as a site of negotiation than one of articulation (McDonald, 2009: 572). The social construction of security cannot be comprehensively understood in isolation from the role of the audience and the social, political and historical contexts in which particular discourses of security become possible. Thierry Balzacq (2005) supports this essay’s view that the securitisation cannot merely be understood as a speech act, inasmuch as he contends that the articulation of security is one part of the securitisation process: it relies upon the acquiescence, consent or support of particular constituencies. Security then involves stages of identification and mobilisation (Paul Roe, 2009: 616), in which the securityness of a threat and the appropriate response to it are negotiated within an interactive process between actors and audiences. Hence security is contextual; different threats are privileged by different communities, particular securitisations are legitimated across time and space according to narratives of history, culture and identity and different voices are empowered or marginalised to define security and threat. Waever (1995: 57) argues that security is articulated only from a specific place, in an institutional voice, by elites. This state-centricism serves to marginalise the experiences and articulations of the powerless in global politics. Hansen (2000: 306) postulates that “a focus on speech acts means contributing to the silencing of women, whose suffering and engagement with security discourses is neglected in a framework that focuses on the articulation of the powerful”. This focus on dominant voices renders the speech act framework impotent in terms of grappling with the plight of the most vulnerable in world politics—and their experiences of and engagement with security and threat. This paper’s proclivity to a hermeneutic approach to security problematises the decisionistic (Williams, 2003: 521) approach to the ‘moment’ at which threats are designated. Securitisation does not occur only at particular instances; issues can become institutionalised as security issues or threats without dramatic moments of intervention (Bigo, 2002). Looking ‘beyond the moment’ of intervention allows one to assess more comprehensively why an actor represents an issue as a threat in a particular context and why a specific constituency accepts it as such. Hence security is not merely that which fulfils the criteria of securitisation (Ciuta, 2009: 303), it does not have an unchanging essence—but rather is the product of historical structures and processes of struggles for power (Lipschutz, 1995: 8) between societal groups with competing interests. Immigration as a security threat in Europe for example, was the product of long-term processes of institutionalisation and related heavily to the incorporation of immigration within the jurisdiction of security professionals such as the police (Bigo 2000). Moreover, there is no simple dichotomy between the political and security. Such a dichotomy is problematic in that suggests an either/or approach, whereby an issue is either a security threat or a political issue. Immigration in the UK is not seen by all constituencies as a threat to security. For some it is a risk and for others the casting of immigration as a threat is a wholly disputable discourse. Thus, the meaning of security is not fixed within the speech act of an elite group, but rather is open to argumentation and can be questioned on the grounds of truth, rightness and sincerity (Wyn-Jones, 1999: 110). Security as a speech act frames the concept within communicative action and legitimation— involving a presentation of evidence and a commitment to convincing others of the validity of one’s position in a process of justification. A theory so reliant on speech for its’ explanatory position fails to address the dynamics of security in a world where political communication is increasingly bound with images and in which televisual communication is an essential communicative medium. The construction of the terrorist for example in the Bush and Blair discourse post 9/11 is inextricable from the image dominated context in which it takes place and through which meaning is communicated. The nexus between the discursive construction of the terrorist as a deadly threat and televisual imagery working to the same end is emblemised by the construction of the terrorist attacks on 9/11 as “acts of war”. Hence one cannot understand Bush’s rhetorical move to construct the attacks as unprecedented and new forms of warfare thereby invoking the nation’s right to self-defence (Jackson, 2007: 356), without assessing the impact that the extraordinary and repeated images of that act had on reactions to it. Here in lies the fundamental merit and pitfall of the speech act theory. On the one hand it provides us with an innovative understanding of the metaphorical constitution of terrorism in discourse and on the other it remains closed to the impact different mediums of communication have on the securitisation process. Thus, language is only one means through which meaning is communicated (Moller, 2007: 180). Drawing on Michel Foucault, this essay problematises the reduction by the speech act theory, of securitisation to a purely linguistic rhetoric. The meaning we attach to security and our knowledge of what constitutes security exists within both the material and textual realms, for they are not mutually exclusive. Foucault (1980: 63) holds that once a discursive utterance is considered an action or as a practice, this then begins to verge on the territory of materiality and becomes more easily linked to the array of physical activities through which the diagnosis may be made initially. To illuminate his concept of discursive practices, Foucault invokes the notion of extra-discursive—which relates to the idea that similar discursive acts can occur in a multitude of ways and various different forms that stretch from the textual to material level of discursive practice. The speech act theory defines security as language—thus language becomes security. Such an over-concentration on language signals a myopia of text, an over-evaluation of the linguistic and representational powers of language in isolation from the material arrangements of power in which they are entrenched and that they in turn extend (Foucault Journal, 2001: 540). The over-evaluation by the speech act theory of the linguistic powers of language in isolation from the material context of power, in which they are intermeshed, is problematised by the Didier Bigo (2002). Bigo (2002: 65) holds that “security is constructed and applied to different issues and areas through a range of often routinised practices rather than only through speech acts that enable emergency measures”. Accordingly, practices of surveillance and border controls for example, can be central to the process of securitisation and are not simply those actions enabled by preceding speech acts (McDonald, 2009: 570). Recognising the role of physical systems in the construction of security, that is, the generation of meaning and the productive power of such systems—demands an acceptance that security exists outside of the speech act. Hence, the speech act framework of security problematically neglects physical action which can serve to communicate ideas about security in their own right (Hansen, 2000: 300-1). In summation, security is constructed through processes of social interaction, but cannot be defined narrowly as existing only within the speech act. Hence, the definition of security in terms of a discourse-action sequence is problematic, inasmuch as it fails to recognise the complexity of the construction of security in global politics. Assuming that security merely resides within the discursive positioning of threats, neglects the historical and social contexts in which security becomes possible. Thus, discourses of security are bound by the historical and social structures in which they are produced. The speech act then is just one dynamic of the securitisation process, the role of audiences, visual communication and physical practices must all be examined in order to understand how security is experienced in different contexts. Security exists within the interplay between self-identity and the construction of meaning, thus the feeling of threat and being secured is produced within all social structures. Security is what we make of it, different worldviews and discourses bound by social structures and communicated in diverse ways, deliver different discourses about security. Security can be constructed physically through bureaucratic systems, through the discourses of the state and within marginalised groups whose experience of threat and security may not be known or heard. Security therefore is not just a speech act.<br/>Can’t scale-up psycho-analysis to the state level<br/>Epstein 10 – senior lecturer in government and IR – University of Sydney<br/>Charlotte, “Who speaks? Discourse, the subject and the study of identity in international politics,” European Journal of International Relations XX(X) 1–24<br/>To be clear, this move is not intended to deny the intimate links between discourse and subjectivity. The earlier foray into Lacanian thought served precisely to underline the centrality of discourse to both the making and subsequent analysis of the subject. But by the same token it also drew out what is required to wield the discourse approach effec¬tively in IR. Indeed Lacan’s analysis emphasizes the sheer complexity of the dynamics of a highly individual phenomenon (identity), and consequently the difficulties in taking this level as the starting point for analysing all other levels at which identity is politically at play.13 As the discipline that positions itself at the highest level of analysis (the supra¬national), IR cannot maintain its focus at the level where some of the finer debates around subjectivity take place (see for example, Butler, 1997). The issue here is one of discipli-nary specificity, or, in other words, equipping IR for what it wants to do; and the solu¬tion proposed is one of suspension or bracketing. To restate this important point differently, at the individual level, subjectivities and subject-positions remain coextensive. The distinction between subject-positions and subjectivities becomes operative once the analysis shifts beyond the individual level. This distinction thus offers a theoretically cogent way of studying identity while bracket¬ing some of its more unwieldy dimensions that may, moreover, not be pertinent at the levels at which IR casts its focus. It renders the discourse approach operative for IR, because it makes it possible to study state identities, without having to presume that states have feelings, or indeed enter into questions of how much exactly are they like people, or what kind of selves do they possess. What the discourse approach analyses, then, is the ways in which actors — crucially, whether individuals or states — define themselves by stepping into a particular subject-position carved out by a discourse. In taking on the ‘I/we’ of that discourse, actors’ identities are produced in a very specific way. In doing so, they are establishing them¬selves as the subjects of particular discourses, such as the anti-whaling discourse, and thereby marking themselves as ‘anti-whalers’. How, then, do discursive subject-positions differ from Wendt’s (1999: 227–229) role identities, where the actor is similarly seen as stepping into institutionalized roles (such as professor and student)? The crucial differ¬ence is that the concept of subject-position does not harbour any assumption about any primordial self supporting these roles. Importantly, this is not to say that the self does not exist — that the professor or student have no selves — but simply that the concept is not relevant to the analysis of the discursive construction of identity, especially when taken to the interstate level.</p><p>This is a reason to ignore their arguments in the context of policy.<br/>Robinson 4 Andrew 2004 “The Politics of Lack” Blackwell Synergy</p><p>As should by now be clear, the central claims of Lacanian theory are ontological rather than political. &nbsp;Indeed, since Lacan’s work deals with politics only very occasionally, the entire project of using Lacan politically is fraught with hazards. &nbsp;With rare exceptions, Lacanian theorists put ontology in the driving seat, allowing it to guide their political theorizing. &nbsp;Political discourse and events are subsumed into a prior theoretical framework in a manner more reminiscent of an attempt to confirm already accepted assumptions than of an attempt to assess the theory itself. &nbsp;Among the authors discussed here, Zizek takes this furthest: &nbsp;the stuff of theory is ‘notions, which have a reality above and beyond any referent, so that, if reality dows not conform to the notions, it is “so much the worse for reality’ (in Butler, Laclau, and Zizek 2000, 244). &nbsp;The selection and interpretation of examples, whether in concrete analysis of political discourse or in theoretical exegesis, is often selective in a way which appears to confirm the general theory only because inconvenient counterexamples are ignored. &nbsp;The entire edifice often appears wholly a priori and non-falsifiable, and the case for its acceptance is extremely vague. &nbsp;Most often, the imperative to adopt a Lacanian as opposed to (say) a Rawlsian or an orthodox Marxist approach is couched in terms of dogmatically-posited demands that one accept the idea of constitutive lack. &nbsp;A failure to do so is simply denounced as ‘shirking’, ‘blindness’, inability to accept’ and so on. &nbsp;In this way, Lacanian theory renders itself almost immune to analytical critique on terms it would find acceptable. &nbsp;Furtehrmore, a slippage frequently emerges between the external ‘acceptance’ of antagonism and its subjective encouragement. &nbsp;For instance, Ernesto Laclau calls for a ‘symbolisation of impossibility as such as a positive value’ (in Butler, Laclau, and Zizek 2000, 1999, original emphasis).</p></div></div></td><td>12/7/13</td></tr><tr><td style="width:100%; word-break:break-all; word-break:break-word;"><div><p><input onclick="saveEntry(27)" src="../../xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" tppabs="http://hspolicy13.debatecoaches.org/xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" style="float:right;" title="Save" type="image" value="Save"></input>
