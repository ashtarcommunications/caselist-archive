Similarly, if Asian countries increasingly rely on the international trading system to maintain their food security, these trading relationships—such as with the United States and other major exporters—will likely have collateral political effects that will in turn have long-term strategic implications. Finally, rapid population growth in the Asia-Pacific region, while not necessarily a direct cause of food insecurity, will certainly reduce the margin of error for policymakers in the event that they indulge in poor agricultural planning or engage in other forms of food security miscalculation.</p><p>Extinction<br/>Yee and Storey 2 Herbert is a Professor of Politics and IR @ Hong Kong Baptist University, and Ian is a Lecturer in Defence Studies @ Deakin University. “The China Threat: Perceptions, Myths and Reality,” p. 5&nbsp;</p><p>The fourth factor contributing to the perception of a China threat is the fear of political and economic collapse in the PRC, resulting in territorial fragmentation, civil war and waves of refugees pouring into neighbouring countries. Naturally, any or all of these scenarios would have a profoundly negative impact on regional stability. Today the Chinese leadership faces a raft of internal problems, including the increasing political demands of its citizens, a growing population, a shortage of natural resources and a deterioration in the natural environment caused by rapid industrialization and pollution. These problems are putting a strain on the central government’s ability to govern effectively. Political disintegration or a Chinese civil war might result in millions of Chinese refugees seeking asylum in neighbouring countries. Such an unprecedented exodus of refugees from a collapsed PRC would no doubt put a severe strain on the limited resources of China’s neighbours. A fragmented China could also result in another nightmare scenario- nuclear weapons falling into the hands of irresponsible local provincial leaders or warlords. From this perspective, a disintegrating China would also pose a threat to its neighbours and the world.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>DHS</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>Manufacturing</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>Unemployment causes systemic suffering and death – that’s a D-Rule<br/>Dean Baker, Co-Director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, and Kevin Hassett, Senior Fellow and Director of Economic Policy Studies at the American Enterprise Institute, former served as a senior economist at the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and an associate professor of economics and finance at the Graduate School of Business of Columbia University, holds a Ph.D. in Economics from the University of Pennsylvania, 05-12-2012, “The Human Disaster of Unemployment,” <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.cepr.net/index.php/op-eds-and-columns/op-eds-and-columns/the-human-disaster-of-unemployment  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.cepr.net/index.php/op-eds-and-columns/op-eds-and-columns/the-human-disaster-of-unemployment%27" tppabs="http://www.cepr.net/index.php/op-eds-and-columns/op-eds-and-columns/the-human-disaster-of-unemployment"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.cepr.net/index.php/op-eds-and-columns/op-eds-and-columns/the-human-disaster-of-unemployment</span></a></span><br/>Long-term unemployment is experienced disproportionately by the young, the old, the less educated, and African-American and Latino workers.While older workers are less likely to be laid off than younger workers, they are about half as likely to be rehired. One result is that older workers have seen the largest proportionate increase in unemployment in this downturn. The number of unemployed people between ages 50 and 65 has more than doubled.The prospects for the re-employment of older workers deteriorate sharply the longer they are unemployed. A worker between ages 50 and 61 who has been unemployed for 17 months has only about a 9 percent chance of finding a new job in the next three months. A worker who is 62 or older and in the same situation has only about a 6 percent chance. As unemployment increases in duration, these slim chances drop steadily.The result is nothing short of a national emergency. Millions of workers have been disconnected from the work force, and possibly even from society. If they are not reconnected, the costs to them and to society will be grim.Unemployment is almost always a traumatic event, especially for older workers. A paper by the economists Daniel Sullivan and Till von Wachter estimates a 50 to 100 percent increase in death rates for older male workers in the years immediately following a job loss, if they previously had been consistently employed. This higher mortality rate implies that a male worker displaced in midcareer can expect to live about one and a half years less than a worker who keeps his job.There are various reasons for this rise in mortality. One is suicide. A recent study found that a 10 percent increase in the unemployment rate (say from 8 to 8.8 percent) would increase the suicide rate for males by 1.47 percent. This is not a small effect. Assuming a link of that scale, the increase in unemployment would lead to an additional 128 suicides per month in the United States. The picture for the long-term unemployed is especially disturbing. The duration of unemployment is the dominant force in the relationship between joblessness and the risk of suicide.Joblessness is also associated with some serious illnesses, although the causal links are poorly understood. Studies have found strong links between unemployment and cancer, with unemployed men facing a 25 percent higher risk of dying of the disease. Similarly higher risks have been found for heart disease and psychiatric problems.The physical and psychological consequences of unemployment are significant enough to affect family members. The economists Kerwin Charles and Melvin Stephens recently found an 18 percent increase in the probability of divorce following a husband’s job loss and 13 percent after a wife’s. Unemployment of parents also has a negative impact on achievement of their children. In the long run, children whose fathers lose a job when they are kids have reduced earnings as adults — about 9 percent lower annually than children whose fathers do not experience unemployment.We all understand how the human costs can be so high. For many people, their very identity is their occupation. Few events rival the emotional strain of job loss.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>Remittances</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>K</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>) Reps 1st = never emancipate, and placing them 1st shatters actual change.</p><p>Dewsbury ’03 (John-David Dewsbury -- School of Geographical Studies, University of Bristol -- Environment and Planning A 2003, volume 35, pages 1907-1932 -- <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.sages.unimelb.edu.au/news/mhgr/dewsbury.pdf)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.sages.unimelb.edu.au/news/mhgr/dewsbury.pdf)%27" tppabs="http://www.sages.unimelb.edu.au/news/mhgr/dewsbury.pdf)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.sages.unimelb.edu.au/news/mhgr/dewsbury.pdf)</span></a></span></p><p>That someone includes us -- the social scientists, the researchers, and the writers. In some way we are all false witnesses to what is there.(2) So, even though the philosophical drive moves against the apparently sterile setup of totalizing representations, the presentation of ideas is trapped within the structure it is trying to critique. In my opinion, this sterility is only apparent. Significantly, this appearance is valid from both sides: from the side of representational theory because of the belief in the representational structure as being able to give an account of everything; and from the side of nonrepresentational theory because of the danger of getting carried away with an absolute critique of representations. The apparent sterility comes from this last point: that in getting carried away with critique you fail to appreciate that the building blocks of representation are not sterile in themselves -- only when they are used as part of a system. The representational system, its structure and regulation of meaning, is not complete -- it needs constant maintenance, loyalty, and faith from those who practice it. In this regard, its power is in its pragmatic functions: easy communication of ideas (that restricts their potential extension), and sustainable, defensible, and consensual agreement on understanding (a certain kind of understanding, and hence a certain type of knowledge). The nonrepresentational argument comes into its own in asking us to revisit the performative space of representation in a manner that is more attuned to its fragile constitution. The point being that representation left critically unattended only allows for conceptual difference and not for a concept of difference as such. The former maintains existing ideological markers whilst the latter challenges us to invent new ones. For me, the project of nonrepresentational theory then, is to excavate the empty space between the lines of representational meaning in order to see what is also possible. The representational system is not wrong: rather, it is the belief that it offers complete understanding -- and that only it offers any sensible understanding at all -- that is critically flawed.&nbsp;</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>There’s always value to life –Prefer our ev because of Frankl’s subject position.</p><p>Phyllis D. Coontz, PhD Graduate School of Public and International Affairs University of Pittsburgh, et al, JOURNAL OF COMMUNITY HEALTH NURSING, 2001, 18(4), 235-246 – J-Stor</p><p>In the 1950s, psychiatrist and theorist Viktor Frankl (1963) described an existential theory of purpose and meaning in life. Frankl, a long-time prisoner in a concentration camp, re- lated several instances of transcendent states that he experienced in the midst of that terri- ble suffering using his own experiences and observations. He believed that these experi- ences allowed him and others to maintain their sense of dignity and self-worth. Frankl (1969) claimed that transcendence occurs by giving to others, being open to others and the environment, and coming to accept the reality that some situations are un- changeable. He hypothesized that life always has meaning for the individual; a person can always decide how to face adversity. Therefore, self-transcendence provides mean- ing and enables the discovery of meaning for a person (Frankl, 1963). Expanding Frankl's work, Reed (1991b) linked self-transcendence with mental health. Through a developmental process individuals gain an increasing understanding of who they are and are able to move out beyond themselves despite the fact that they are ex- periencing physical and mental pain. This expansion beyond the self occurs through in- trospection, concern about others and their well-being, and integration of the past and fu- ture to strengthen one's present life (Reed, 1991b).</p><p>They say their K “controls the vital internal link to the case”.

It is part of an attempt to make critical evaluation an intrinsic element of responsibility. Responsibility to this more fundamental ethic gives the ethic of consequences meaning. Consequentialism and responsibility are here drawn into what Schluchter, in terms that will be familiar to anyone conversant with constructivism in International Relations, has called a 'reflexive principle'. In the wilful Realist vision, scepticism and consequentialism are linked in an attempt to construct not just a more substantial vision of political responsibility, but also the kinds of actors who might adopt it, and the kinds of social structures that might support it. A consequentialist ethic is not simply a choice adopted by actors: it is a means of trying to foster particular kinds of self-critical individuals and societies, and in so doing to encourage a means by which one can justify and foster a politics of responsibility. The ethic of responsibility in wilful Realism thus involves a commitment to both autonomy and limitation, to freedom and restraint, to an acceptance of limits and the criticism of limits. Responsibility clearly involves prudence and an accounting for current structures and their historical evolution; but it is not limited to this, for it seeks ultimately the creation of responsible subjects within a philosophy of limits. Seen in this light, the Realist commitment to objectivity appears quite differently. Objectivity in terms of consequentialist analysis does not simply take the actor or action as given, it is a political practice — an attempt to foster a responsible self, undertaken by an analyst with a commitment to objectivity which is itself based in a desire to foster a politics of responsibility. Objectivity in the sense of coming to terms with the 'reality' of contextual conditions and likely outcomes of action is not only necessary for success, it is vital for self-reflection, for sustained engagement with the practical and ethical adequacy of one's views. The blithe, self-serving, and uncritical stances of abstract moralism or rationalist objectivism avoid self-criticism by refusing to engage with the intractability of the world 'as it is'. Reducing the world to an expression of their theoretical models, political platforms, or ideological programmes, they fail to engage with this reality, and thus avoid the process of self-reflection at the heart of responsibility. By contrast, Realist objectivity takes an engagement with this intractable 'object' that is not reducible to one's wishes or will as a necessary condition of ethical engagement, self-reflection, and self-creation.7 Objectivity is not a naive naturalism in the sense of scientific laws or rationalist calculation; it is a necessary engagement with a world that eludes one's will. A recognition of the limits imposed by 'reality' is a condition for a recognition of one's own limits — that the world is not simply an extension of one's own will. But it is also a challenge to use that intractability as a source of possibility, as providing a set of openings within which a suitably chastened and yet paradoxically energised will to action can responsibly be pursued. In the wilful Realist tradition, the essential opacity of both the self and the world are taken as limiting principles. Limits upon understanding provide chastening parameters for claims about the world and actions within it. But they also provide challenging and creative openings within which diverse forms of life can be developed: the limited unity of the self and the political order is the precondition for freedom. The ultimate opacity of the world is not to be despaired of: it is a condition of possibility for the wilful, creative construction of selves and social orders which embrace the diverse human potentialities which this lack of essential or intrinsic order makes possible.8 But it is also to be aware of the less salutary possibilities this involves. Indeterminacy is not synonymous with absolute freedom — it is both a condition of, and imperative toward, responsibility</p><p>Even if consequentialism is generally wrong, it’s accurate in the nuclear context</p><p>William H.

I have contended that nuclear deter- rence, viewed as a pure case, need not be impermissible, but I have not argued that current American strategic policy is morally legitimate, let alone wise. That strategy is a complex one, exercised in a complicated environment, and there are many difficult and important questions con- cerning the permissibility of aspects of that policy, for instance, the use of nuclear weapons to deter conventional aggression, which I have not touched upon. My focus has been, more simply, on the moral acceptability of the basic deterrent thinking which lies at the core of current policy. Of all the moral issues that face us today, however, nuclear policy is the one that, because of the complex factual issues and number of persons likely to be affected, most cries out to be handled in consequentialist terms. Although it is clearly good even on utilitarian grounds that we have a repugnance to making threats of immoral behavior, even where P6 would condone it, the limits of a narrowly deontological perspective are soon obvious. For one thing, such discussions do not easily integrate finely grained factual issues or questions of probability, such as the chances of a nuclear accident, into their overall moral assessments. Much hangs on the real, historical and political (as opposed to merely game-theoretically supposed), consequences of the contemporary practice of deterrence nuclear proliferation-and on assessing accurately the feasibility of al- ternatives to the current arms race. A moral theory with significant con- sequentialist strands would seem to be necessary to give these sorts of considerations their due.&nbsp;</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>A focus on representations destroys social change by ignoring political and material constraints<br/>Taft-Kaufman, 95 &nbsp;(Jill, professor, Department of Speech Communication And Dramatic Arts, at Central Michigan University, Southern Communication Journal, Spring, proquest)<br/>The postmodern passwords of "polyvocality," "Otherness," and "difference," unsupported by substantial analysis of the concrete contexts of subjects, creates a solipsistic quagmire. The political sympathies of the new cultural critics, with their ostensible concern for the lack of power experienced by marginalized people, aligns them with the political left. Yet, despite their adversarial posture and talk of opposition, their discourses on intertextuality and inter-referentiality isolate them from and ignore the conditions that have produced leftist politics--conflict, racism, poverty, and injustice. In short, as Clarke (1991) asserts, postmodern emphasis on new subjects conceals the old subjects, those who have limited access to good jobs, food, housing, health care, and transportation, as well as to the media that depict them. Merod (1987) decries this situation as one which leaves no vision, will, or commitment to activism. He notes that academic lip service to the oppositional is underscored by the absence of focused collective or politically active intellectual communities. Provoked by the academic manifestations of this problem Di Leonardo (1990) echoes Merod and laments: Has there ever been a historical era characterized by as little radical analysis or activism and as much radical-chic writing as ours? Maundering on about Otherness: phallocentrism or Eurocentric tropes has become a lazy academic substitute for actual engagement with the detailed histories and contemporary realities of Western racial minorities, white women, or any Third World population. (p. 530) Clarke's assessment of the postmodern elevation of language to the "sine qua non" of critical discussion is an even stronger indictment against the trend. Clarke examines Lyotard's (1984) The Postmodern Condition in which Lyotard maintains that virtually all social relations are linguistic, and, therefore, it is through the coercion that threatens speech that we enter the "realm of terror" and society falls apart. To this assertion, Clarke replies: I can think of few more striking indicators of the political and intellectual impoverishment of a view of society that can only recognize the discursive. If the worst terror we can envisage is the threat not to be allowed to speak, we are appallingly ignorant of terror in its elaborate contemporary forms. It may be the intellectual's conception of terror (what else do we do but speak?), but its projection onto the rest of the world would be calamitous....(pp. 2-27) &nbsp;The realm of the discursive is derived from the requisites for human life, which are in the physical world, rather than in a world of ideas or symbols.(4) Nutrition, shelter, and protection are basic human needs that require collective activity for their fulfillment. Postmodern emphasis on the discursive without an accompanying analysis of how the discursive emerges from material circumstances hides the complex task of envisioning and working towards concrete social goals (Merod, 1987). Although the material conditions that create the situation of marginality escape the purview of the postmodernist, the situation and its consequences are not overlooked by scholars from marginalized groups. Robinson (1990) for example, argues that "the justice that working people deserve is economic, not just textual" (p. 571). Lopez (1992) states that "the starting point for organizing the program content of education or political action must be the present existential, concrete situation" (p. 299). West (1988) asserts that borrowing French post-structuralist discourses about "Otherness" blinds us to realities of American difference going on in front of us (p. 170). Unlike postmodern "textual radicals" who Rabinow (1986) acknowledges are "fuzzy about power and the realities of socioeconomic constraints" (p. 255), most writers from marginalized groups are clear about how discourse interweaves with the concrete circumstances that create lived experience. People whose lives form the material for postmodern counter-hegemonic discourse do not share the optimism over the new recognition of their discursive subjectivities, because such an acknowledgment does not address sufficiently their collective historical and current struggles against racism, sexism, homophobia, and economic injustice. They do not appreciate being told they are living in a world in which there are no more real subjects. Ideas have consequences. Emphasizing the discursive self when a person is hungry and homeless represents both a cultural and humane failure. The need to look beyond texts to the perception and attainment of concrete social goals keeps writers from marginalized groups ever-mindful of the specifics of how power works through political agendas, institutions, agencies, and the budgets that fuel them.&nbsp;</p><p>They embrace anti-politics – this dooms their project, creates atrocity, and cedes politics to the Right.<br/>Boggs ’ 97 (CARL BOGGS – Professor and Ph.D. Political Science, National University, Los Angeles -- Theory and Society 26: 741-780)<br/>The false sense of empowerment that comes with such mesmerizing impulses is accompanied by a loss of public engagement, an erosion of citizenship and a depleted capacity of individuals in large groups to work for social change. As this ideological quagmire worsens, urgent problems that are destroying the fabric of American society will go unsolved &nbsp;-- perhaps even unrecognized -- only to fester more ominously into the future. And such problems (ecological crisis, poverty, urban decay, spread of infectious cannot be understood outside the larger social and global context diseases, technological displacement of workers) of internationalized markets, finance, and communications. &nbsp;Paradoxically, the widespread retreat from politics, often inspired by localist sentiment, comes at a time when agendas that ignore or side-step these global realities will, more than ever, be reduced to impotence. In his commentary on the state of citizenship today, Wolin refers to the increasing sublimation and dilution of politics, as larger numbers of people turn away from public concerns toward private ones. By diluting the life of common involvements, we negate the very idea of politics as a source of public ideals and visions.74 In the meantime, the fate of the world hangs in the balance. The unyielding truth is that, even as the ethos of anti-politics becomes more compelling and even fashionable in the United States, it is the vagaries of political power that will continue to decide the fate of human societies. This last point demands further elaboration. The shrinkage of politics hardly means that corporate colonization will be less of a reality, that social hierarchies will somehow disappear, or that gigantic state and military structures will lose their hold over people's lives. Far from it: the space abdicated by a broad citizenry, well-informed and ready to participate at many levels, can in fact be filled by authoritarian and reactionary elites &nbsp;-- an already familiar dynamic in many lesser- developed countries. The fragmentation and chaos of a Hobbesian world, not very far removed from the rampant individualism, social Darwinism, and civic violence that have been so much a part of the American landscape, could be the prelude to a powerful Leviathan designed to impose order in the face of disunity and atomized retreat. In this way the eclipse of politics might set the stage for a reassertion of politics in more virulent guise &nbsp;-- or it might help further rationalize the existing power structure. In either case, the state would likely become what Hobbes anticipated: the embodiment of those universal, collec- tive interests that had vanished from civil society.75&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>b.

And how should we equip young people to face these challenges? While we cannot be sure of the exact nature of the challenges, we can say unequivocally that humankind will face them together. If the end of the twentieth century marked the triumph of the capitalists, individualism, and personal responsibility, the new century will preset challenges that require collective action, unity, and enlightened self-interest. Confronting global warming, depleted natural resources, global super viruses, global crime syndicates, and multinational corporations with no conscience and no accountability will require cooperation, openness, honesty, compromise, and most of all solidarity – ideals not exactly cultivated in the twentieth century. We can no longer suffer to see life through the tiny lens of our own existence. Never in the history of the world has our collective fate been so intricately interwoven. Our very existence depends upon our ability to adapt to this new paradigm, to envision a more cohesive society. &nbsp;With humankind’s next great challenge comes also great opportunity. Ironically, modern individualism backed us into a corner. We have two choices, work together in solidarity or perish together in alienation. Unlike any other crisis before, the noose is truly around the neck of the whole world at once. Global super viruses will ravage rich and poor alike, developed and developing nations, white and black, woman, man, and child. Global warming and damage to the environment will affect climate change and destroy ecosystems across the globe. Air pollution will force gas masks on our faces, our depleted atmosphere will make a predator of the sun, and chemicals will invade and corrupt our water supplies. Every single day we are presented the opportunity to change our current course, to survive modernity in a manner befitting our better nature. Through zealous cooperation and radical solidarity we can alter the course of human events. Regarding the practical matter of equipping young people to face the challenges of a global, interconnected world, we need to teach cooperation, community, solidarity, balance and tolerance in schools. We need to take a holistic approach to education. Standardized test scores alone will not begin to prepare young people for the world they will inherit. The three staples of traditional education (reading, writing, and arithmetic) need to be supplemented by three cornerstones of a modern education, exposure, exposure, and more exposure. How can we teach solidarity? How can we teach community in the age of rugged individualism? How can we counterbalance crass commercialism and materialism? How can we impart the true meaning of power? These are the educational challenges we face in the new century. There is a longstanding dispute over how to properly quantify civic engagement. Some will say that today’s youth are less involved politically and hence demonstrate a lower degree of civic engagement. Others cite high volunteer rates among the youth and claim it demonstrates a high exhibition of civic engagement. And there are about a hundred other theories put forward on the subject of civic engagement and today’s youth. But one thing is for sure; today’s youth no longer see government and politics as an effective or valuable tool for affecting positive change in the world. Instead of criticizing this judgment, perhaps we should come to sympathize and even admire it. Author Kurt Vonnegut said, “There is a tragic flaw in our precious Constitution, and I don’t know what can be done to fix it. This is it: only nut cases want to be president.” Maybe the youth’s rejection of American politics isn’t a shortcoming but rather a rational and appropriate response to their experience. Consequently, the term civic engagement takes on new meaning for us today. In order to foster fundamental change on the systemic level, which we have already said is necessary for our survival in the twenty-first century, we need to fundamentally change our systems. Therefore, part of our challenge becomes convincing the youth that these systems, and by systems we mean government and commerce, have the potential for positive change. Civic engagement consequently takes on a more specific and political meaning in this context.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>c.

Both were faith based, inclined to be impervious toward evidence, and tilted toward moral absolutism. One proceeded from the premise that U.S. power was always benign, the other from the premise that it was always pernicious. One justified empire—if not necessarily by that name—on the ground that the alternatives were worse; the other saw empire every time the United States wielded power. But these two polar tendencies are not the only options. There is, at least embryonically, a patriotic left that stands, as Michael Tomasky has put it, “between Cheney and Chomsky.”5 It disputes U.S. policies, strategies, and tactics—vociferously. But it criticizes from the inside out, without discarding the hope, if not of redemption, at least of improvement. It looks to its intellectuals for, among other things, scrutiny of the conflicts among the powers, the chinks in the armor, the embryonic and waning forces, paradoxes of unintended consequences, the sense immured in the nonsense, and vice versa. It believes in security—the nation’s physical security as much as its economic security. It does not consider security to be somebody else’s business. When it deplores conditions that are deplorable, it makes it plain, in substance and tone, that the critic shares membership with the criticized. It acknowledges—and wrestles with—the dualities of America: the liberty and arrogance twinned, the bullying and tolerance, myopia and energy, standardization and variety, ignorance and inventiveness, the awful dark heart of darkness and the self-reforming zeal. It does not labor under the illusion that the world would be benign but for U.S. power or that capitalism is uniformly the most damaging economic system ever. It lives inside, with an indignation born of family feeling. Its anger is intimate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>Heg good</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>First, leadership is critical to democratization efforts</p><p>ALBRIGHT (Fmr Sect. Of State) ‘97<br/>Madeline, Federal News Service, 11 Feb., p. ln<em>wyo-tjc</em></p><p>Mr. Chairman, more than seven years have passed since the fall of the Berlin Wall and five years since the demise of the Soviet Union. Today, America is secure, our economy vibrant, and our ideals ascendant. Across the globe, the movement towards open societies and open markets is wider and deeper than ever before. Democracy's triumph is neither accidental nor irreversible; it is the result of sustained American leadership. It would not have been possible without the power of our example, the strength of our military, or the constancy and creativity of our diplomacy. That is the central lesson of the twentieth century -- and this lesson must continue to guide us if we are to safeguard our interests as we enter the twenty-first. Make no mistake: the interests served by American foreign policy are not the abstract inventions of State Department planners; they are the concrete real, ties of our daily lives. Think about it. Would the American people be as secure if weapons of mass destruction, instead of being controlled, fell into the wrong hands? That is precisely what would have happened if the Administration and Congress had not acted to ensure the dismantling of Iraq's nuclear weapons program, the freezing of North Korea's, and the securing of Russia's.</p><p>Second, democratic consolidation prevents war and extinction</p><p>&nbsp;CARNEGIE COMMISSION ON PREVENTING DEADLY CONFLICT 1995<br/>&nbsp;staff, “Promoting Democracy in the 1990’s”, Oct, p. online: <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.carnegie.org/sub/pubs/deadly/dia95_01.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.carnegie.org/sub/pubs/deadly/dia95_01.html%27" tppabs="http://www.carnegie.org/sub/pubs/deadly/dia95_01.html"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.carnegie.org/sub/pubs/deadly/dia95_01.html</span></a></span> <em>wyo-tjc</em></p><p>This hardly exhausts the lists of threats to our security and well-being in the coming years and decades. In the former Yugoslavia nationalist aggression tears at the stability of Europe and could easily spread. The flow of illegal drugs intensifies through increasingly powerful international crime syndicates that have made common cause with authoritarian regimes and have utterly corrupted the institutions of tenuous, democratic ones. Nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons continue to proliferate. The very source of life on Earth, the global ecosystem, appears increasingly endangered. Most of these new and unconventional threats to security are associated with or aggravated by the weakness or absence of democracy, with its provisions for legality, accountability, popular sovereignty, and openness.<br/>LESSONS OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY<br/>The experience of this century offers important lessons. Countries that govern themselves in a truly democratic fashion do not go to war with one another. They do not aggress against their neighbors to aggrandize themselves or glorify their leaders. Democratic governments do not ethnically "cleanse" their own populations, and they are much less likely to face ethnic insurgency. Democracies do not sponsor terrorism against one another. They do not build weapons of mass destruction to use on or to threaten one another. Democratic countries form more reliable, open, and enduring trading partnerships. In the long run they offer better and more stable climates for investment. They are more environmentally responsible because they must answer to their own citizens, who organize to protest the destruction of their environments. They are better bets to honor international treaties since they value legal obligations and because their openness makes it much more difficult to breach agreements in secret. Precisely because, within their own borders, they respect competition, civil liberties, property rights, and the rule of law, democracies are the only reliable foundation on which a new world order of international security and prosperity can be built.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>US heg solves – human rights, democracy and liberal values<br/>Ness 01 - lectures on security and peace building in the Department of International Relations in the College of Asia and the Pacific at the ANU, faculty at the Graduate School of International Studies, University of Denver in the US, Van Ness is a specialist on Chinese foreign policy and the international relations of the Asia-Pacific region, taught at four Japanese universities, including Keio University and the University of Tokyo.

Hegemony in this sense is maintained not only by a predominance of military and economic might but also by propagating particular norms and values. Cultural power is a key component of this concept of hegemony. In sustaining the US role as hegemon in East Asia, the propagation of human rights, democracy, and other liberal values by the United States therefore is as important as the maintaining of its military bases.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>&nbsp;Moreover, US strategic hegemony is linked inextricably with the expansion of the world market economy and the globalization of capitalist modes of production. Thomas Friedman concludes that ‘In the globalization system, the United States is now the sole and dominant superpower and all other nations are subordinate to it to one degree or another’. This is not an anarchic system. It is obviously true that the global system lacks an authoritative world government, but to infer from that fact that state-actors inevitably perceive the world as some approximation of anarchy is to misunderstand the nature of interstate relations in today’s world. Moreover, neither the global system nor the East Asian sub-system is multipolar in the sense that any of the other major powers, since the collapse of the Soviet Union ten years ago, has acted to provide an alternative to US power. To serve as an effective ‘pole’ in international politics, a state must be able to attract other states to join in concert to achieve common objectives.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>Primacy fills in for powerless institutions—key to solve genocide and mass violence globally<br/>Lieber 2005 – PhD from Harvard, Professor of Government and International Affairs at Georgetown, former consultant to the State Department and for National Intelligence Estimates (Robert, “The American Era”, pages 51-52, WEA)<br/>The United States possesses the military and economic means to act assertively on a global basis, but should it do so, and if so, how? In short, if the United States conducts itself in this way, will the world be safer and more stable, and is such a role in America’s national interest? Here, the anarchy problem is especially pertinent. The capacity of the United Nations to act, especially in coping with the most urgent and deadly problems, is severely limited, and in this sense, the demand for “global governance” far exceeds the supply. Since its inception in 1945, there have only been two occasions (Korea in 1950 and Kuwait in 1991) when the U.N. Security Council authorized the use of force, and in both instances the bulk of the forces were provided by the United States. In the most serious cases, especially those involving international terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, ethnic cleansing, civil war, and mass murder, if America does not take the lead, no other country or organization is willing or able to respond effectively. The deadly cases of Bosnia (1991–95) and Rwanda (1994) make this clear. In their own way, so did the demonstrations by the people of Liberia calling for American intervention to save them from the ravages of predatory militias in a failed state. And the weakness of the international reaction to ethnic cleansing, rape, and widespread killing in the Darfur region of Western Sudan provides a more recent example. <br/>Makes extinction invevitable<br/>Kenneth J. Campbell, assistant professor of political science and international relations at the University of Delaware, 2001, Genocide and the Global Village, p. 15-16<br/>Regardless of where or on how small a scale it begins, the crime of genocide is the complete ideological repudiation of, and a direct murderous assault upon, the prevailing liberal international order. Genocide is fundamentally incompatible with, and destructive of an open, tolerant, democratic, free market international order. As genocide scholar Herbert Hirsch has explained: The unwillingness of the world community to take action to end genocide and political massacres is not only immoral but also impractical. Without some semblance of stability, commerce, travel, and the international and intranational interchange of goods and information are subjected to severe disruptions. Where genocide is permitted to proliferate, the liberal international order cannot long survive. No group will be safe; every group will wonder when they will be next. Left unchecked, genocide threatens to destroy whatever security, democracy, and prosperity exists in the present international system. As Roger Smith notes: Even the most powerful nations—those armed with nuclear weapons—may end up in struggles that will lead (accidentally, intentionally, insanely) to the ultimate genocide in which they destroy not only each other, but humankind mankind itself, sewing the fate of the earth forever with a final genocidal effort. In this sense, genocide is a grave threat to the very fabric of the international system and must be stopped, even at some risk to lives and treasure. The preservation and growth of the present liberal international order is a vital interest for all of its members—states as well as non-states—whether or not those members recognize and accept the reality of that objective interest. Nation states, as the principal members of the present international order, are the only authoritative holders of violent enforcement powers. Non-state actors, though increasing in power relative to states, still do not possess the military force, or the democratic authority to use military force, which is necessary to stop determined perpetrators of mass murder. Consequently, nation-states have a special responsibility to prevent, suppress, and punish all malicious assaults on the fundamental integrity of the prevailing international order.</p><p>Hegemony is crucial to ending poverty and creating prosperity <br/>Thayer, ‘7 – Professor of Political Science at the University of Minnesota<br/>Bradley A. American Empire: A Debate. Routledge Press: Taylor and Francis Group, NY. Page # below in &nbsp;<br/>Perhaps the greatest testament to the benefits of the American Empire comes from Deepak Lal, a former Indian foreign service diplomat, researcher at the World Bank, prolific author, and now a professor who started his career confident in the socialist ideology of post-independence India that strongly condemned empire. He has abandoned the position of his youth and is now one of the strongest proponents of the American Empire. Lal has traveled the world and, in the course of his journeys, has witnessed great poverty and misery due to a lack of economic development. He realized that free markets were necessary for the development of poor countries, and this led him to recognize that his faith in socialism was wrong. Just as a conservative famously is said to be a liberal who has been mugged by reality, the hard "evidence and experience" that stemmed from "working and traveling in most parts of the Third World during my professional career" caused this profound change.6'<br/>Lal submits that the only way to bring relief to the desperately poor countries of the Third World is through the American Empire. Empires provide order, and this order "has been essential for the working of the benign processes of globalization, which promote prosperity."62 Globalization is the process of creating a common economic space, which leads to a growing integration of the world economy through the increasingly free movement of goods, capital, and labor. It is the responsibility of the United States, Lal argues, to use the LIED to promote the well-being of all economies, but particularly those in the Third World, so that they too may enjoy economic prosperity. 44 <br/>The effects of poverty outweigh nuclear war<br/>Abu-Jamal, journalist and political activist, ‘98<br/>Mumia, A Quiet and Deadly Violence, 9-19, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://wwwflashpoints.net/mQuietDeadlyViolence.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://wwwflashpoints.net/mQuietDeadlyViolence.html%27" tppabs="http://wwwflashpoints.net/mQuietDeadlyViolence.html"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://wwwflashpoints.net/mQuietDeadlyViolence.html</span></a></span>&nbsp;</p><p>We live, equally immersed, and to a deeper degree, in a nation that condones and ignores wide-ranging "structural' violence, of a kind that destroys human life with a breathtaking ruthlessness. Former Massachusetts prison official and writer, Dr. James Gilligan observes; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By "structural violence" I mean the increased rates of death and disability suffered by those who occupy the bottom rungs of society, as contrasted by those who are above them. Those excess deaths (or at least a demonstrably large proportion of them) are a function of the class structure; and that structure is itself a product of society's collective human choices, concerning how to distribute the collective wealth of the society. These are not acts of God. I am contrasting "structural" with "behavioral violence" by which I mean the non-natural deaths and injuries that are caused by specific behavioral actions of individuals against individuals, such as the deaths we attribute to homicide, suicide, soldiers in warfare, capital punishment, and so on. --(Gilligan, J., MD, Violence: Reflections On a National Epidemic (New York: Vintage, 1996), 192.) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This form of violence, not covered by any of the majoritarian, corporate, ruling-class protected media, is invisible to us and because of its invisibility, all the more insidious. How dangerous is it--really? Gilligan notes: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every fifteen years, on the average, as many people die because of relative poverty as would be killed in a nuclear war that caused 232 million deaths; and every single year, two to three times as many people die from poverty throughout the world as were killed by the Nazi genocide of the Jews over a six-year period. This is, in effect, the equivalent of an ongoing, unending, in fact accelerating, thermonuclear war, or genocide on the weak and poor every year of every decade, throughout the world. Gilligan, p. 196 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Worse still, in a thoroughly capitalist society, much of that violence became internalized, turned back on the Self, because, in a society based on the priority of wealth, those who own nothing are taught to loathe themselves, as if something is inherently wrong with themselves, instead of the social order that promotes this self-loathing. This intense self-hatred was often manifested in familial violence as when the husband beats the wife, the wife smacks the son, and the kids fight each other. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This vicious, circular, and invisible violence, unacknowledged by the corporate media, uncriticized in substandard educational systems, and un-understood by the very folks who suffer in its grips, feeds on the spectacular and more common forms of violence that the system makes damn sure -that we can recognize and must react to it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Hegemony is crucial to response to natural disasters decreasing the motivation for terrorism<br/>Thayer, ‘7 – Professor of Political Science at the University of Minnesota<br/>Bradley A. American Empire: A Debate. Routledge Press: Taylor and Francis Group, NY. Page # below in &nbsp;<br/>The U.S. military is the earth's "911 force"—it serves as the world's police; it is the global paramedic, and the planet's fire department. Whenever there is a natural disaster, earthquake, flood, typhoon, or tsunami, the United States assists the countries in need. In 1991, when flooding caused by cyclone Marian killed almost 140,000 people and left 5 million homeless in Bangladesh, the United States launched Operation Sea Angel to save stranded and starving people by supplying food, potable water, and medical assistance. U.S. forces are credited with saving over 200,000 lives in that operation. In 1999, torrential rains and flash flooding in Venezuela killed 30,000 people and left 140,000 homeless. The United States responded with Operation Fundamental Response, which brought water purification and hygiene equipment saving thousands. Also in 1999, Operation Strong Support aided Central Americans affected by Hurricane Mitch. That hurricane was the fourth-strongest ever recorded in the Atlantic and the worst natural disaster to strike Central America in the twentieth century. The magnitude of the devastation was tremendous, with about 10,000 people killed, 13,000 missing, and 2 million left homeless. It is estimated that 60 percent of the infrastructure in Honduras, Nicaragua, and Guatemala was destroyed. Again, the U.S. military came to the aid of the people affected. It is believed to have rescued about 700 people who otherwise would have died, while saving more from disease due to the timely arrival of medical supplies, food, water, blankets, and mobile shelters. In the next phase of Strong Support, military engineers rebuilt much of the infrastructure of those countries, including bridges, hospitals, roads, and schools. On the day after Christmas in 2004, a tremendous earthquake and tsunami occurred in the Indian Ocean near Sumatra and killed 300,000 people. The United States was the first to respond with aid. More importantly, Washington not only contributed a large amount of aid, $350 million, plus another $350 million provided by American citizens and corporations, but also—only days after the tsunami struck—used its military to help those in need. About 20,000 U.S. soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines responded by providing water, food, medical aid, disease treatment and prevention, as well as forensic assistance to help identify the bodies of those killed. Only the U.S. military could have accomplished this Herculean effort, and it is important to keep in mind that its costs were separate from the $350 million provided by the U.S. government and other money given by American citizens and corporations to relief organizations like the International Committee of the Red Cross/Red Crescent. The generosity of the United States has done more to help the country fight the war on terror than almost any other measure. Before the tsunami, 80 percent of Indonesian opinion was opposed to the United States; after it, 80 percent had a favorable opinion of the United States. In October 2005, an enormous earthquake struck Kashmir, killing about 74,000 people and leaving 3 million homeless. The U.S. military responded immediately, diverting helicopters fighting the war on terror in nearby Afghanistan to bring relief as soon as possible. To help those in need, the United States provided about $156 million in aid to Pakistan; and, as one might expect from those witnessing the generosity of the United States, it left a lasting impression about the United States. Whether in Indonesia or Kashmir, the money was well spent because it helped people in the wake of disasters, but it also had a real impact on the war on terror. 44-45<br/>Natural disasters threaten human extinction faster than any war scenario <br/>Sid-Ahmed, ‘5 – Yeah, it’s the same guy<br/>Mohamed. “The post-earthquake world.” Al-Ahram Weekly Online.

What happened in South Asia is the ecological equivalent of 9/11. Ecological problems like global warming and climatic disturbances in general threaten to make our natural habitat unfit for human life. The extinction of the species has become a very real possibility, whether by our own hand or as a result of natural disasters of a much greater magnitude than the Indian Ocean earthquake and the killer waves it spawned. Human civilisation has developed in the hope that Man will be able to reach welfare and prosperity on earth for everybody. But now things seem to be moving in the opposite direction, exposing planet Earth to the end of its role as a nurturing place for human life. Today, human conflicts have become less of a threat than the confrontation between Man and Nature. At least they are less likely to bring about the end of the human species. The reactions of Nature as a result of its exposure to the onslaughts of human societies have become more important in determining the fate of the human species than any harm it can inflict on itself. Until recently, the threat Nature represented was perceived as likely to arise only in the long run, related for instance to how global warming would affect life on our planet. Such a threat could take decades, even centuries, to reach a critical level. This perception has changed following the devastating earthquake and tsunamis that hit the coastal regions of South Asia and, less violently, of East Africa, on 26 December. This cataclysmic event has underscored the vulnerability of our world before the wrath of Nature and shaken the sanguine belief that the end of the world is a long way away. Gone are the days when we could comfort ourselves with the notion that the extinction of the human race will not occur before a long-term future that will only materialise after millions of years and not affect us directly in any way. We are now forced to live with the possibility of an imminent demise of humankind.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>Hegemony is vital Japanese foreign protection <br/>Thayer, ‘7 – Professor of Political Science at the University of Minnesota<br/>Bradley A.

Hence, we should strive to improve the decisionmaking approaches of administrative agencies. That is the spirit of my proposal. To be sure, neither the question of methodology, nor the quest for the best fit, are unique to the ESA.15 Yet the ESA presents them in thesharpest of contexts, pitting human enterprise against the fate of entire species. One would t-hink, therefore, that the search for the most productive methodological fit for the ESA would be undertaken in earnest by all who have an interest in the promise of species conservation—it should be a model for all other such journeys. What I find in the battle over ESA methodology, however, is mostly rhetoric, intended to disguise efforts to shift the substantive playing field. I dare say that many advocates of using the Scientific Method in the ESA would not know it if they saw it, and many proponents of employing the Precautionary Principle Method at every turn for the ESA are chronic Chicken Littles. It is time to move past these facades and open a genuine discourse on ESA methodology. &nbsp;II. GENERAL FRAMEWORKS FOR DECIDING HOW TO DECIDE People place a lot of stock in their “gut instinct” when making personal decisions. People choose mates, buy houses, pick stocks, and make all sorts of other vital professional and personal decisions based on their guts. “Playing it safe” is another common explanation people offer for their personal decisions. Furthermore, if we want to really run a decision through the wringer, there is the sheet of paper on which we list “pros” on one side and “cons” on the other. There is no shame in using any of these decisionmaking methods; indeed, people boast of the predictive powers of their guts and are happy to debate the pros and cons for hours. What is good enough for people, however, may not be good enough for federal agencies making decisions with sweeping socioeconomic ramifications. I doubt we would tolerate a federal agency openly saying it made such a decision based on its “gut instincts,” or just “because it wants to,” and leaving it at that. We expect more of agencies, but how much more? There are several frameworks we can employ, separately or together, to assist in deciding that question. One focuses on the level of confidence we seek in the agency’s decisions.

I would like to suggest that it is time for American social critics who are enamored with this group, those who actually want to be relevant, to recognize that they have a disease, and a disease regarding which I myself must remember to stay faithful to my own twelve step program of recovery. The disease is the need for elaborate theoretical "remedies" wrapped in neological and multi-syllabic jargon. These elaborate theoretical remedies are more "interesting," to be sure, than the pragmatically settled questions about what shape democracy should take in various contexts, or whether private property should be protected by the state, or regarding our basic human nature (described, if not defined (heaven forbid!), in such statements as "We don't like to starve" and "We like to speak our minds without fear of death" and "We like to keep our children safe from poverty"). As Rorty puts it, "When one of today's academic leftists says that some topic has been 'inadequately theorized,' you can be pretty certain that he or she is going to drag in either philosophy of language, or Lacanian psychoanalysis, or some neo-Marxist version of economic determinism. . . . These futile attempts to philosophize one's way into political relevance are a symptom of what happens when a Left retreats from activism and adopts a spectatorial approach to the problems of its country. Disengagement from practice produces theoretical hallucinations"(italics mine).(1) Or as John Dewey put it in his The Need for a Recovery of Philosophy, "I believe that philosophy in America will be lost between chewing a historical cud long since reduced to woody fiber, or an apologetics for lost causes, . . . . or a scholastic, schematic formalism, unless it can somehow bring to consciousness America's own needs and its own implicit principle of successful action."<br/>Those who suffer or have suffered from this disease Rorty refers to as the Cultural Left, which left is juxtaposed to the Political Left that Rorty prefers and prefers for good reason. Another attribute of the Cultural Left is that its members fancy themselves pure culture critics who view the successes of America and the West, rather than some of the barbarous methods for achieving those successes, as mostly evil, and who view anything like national pride as equally evil even when that pride is tempered with the knowledge and admission of the nation's shortcomings. In other words, the Cultural Left, in this country, too often dismiss American society as beyond reform and redemption. And Rorty correctly argues that this is a disastrous conclusion, i.e. disastrous for the Cultural Left. I think it may also be disastrous for our social hopes, as I will explain.<br/>Leftist American culture critics might put their considerable talents to better use if they bury some of their cynicism about America's social and political prospects and help forge public and political possibilities in a spirit of determination to, indeed, achieve our country - the country of Jefferson and King; the country of John Dewey and Malcom X; the country of Franklin Roosevelt and Bayard Rustin, and of the later George Wallace and the later Barry Goldwater. To invoke the words of King, and with reference to the American society, the time is always ripe to seize the opportunity to help create the "beloved community," one woven with the thread of agape into a conceptually single yet diverse tapestry that shoots for nothing less than a true intra-American cosmopolitan ethos, one wherein both same sex unions and faith-based initiatives will be able to be part of the same social reality, one wherein business interests and the university are not seen as belonging to two separate galaxies but as part of the same answer to the threat of social and ethical nihilism. We who fancy ourselves philosophers would do well to create from within ourselves and from within our ranks a new kind of public intellectual who has both a hungry theoretical mind and who is yet capable of seeing the need to move past high theory to other important questions that are less bedazzling and "interesting" but more important to the prospect of our flourishing - questions such as "How is it possible to develop a citizenry that cherishes a certain hexis, one which prizes the character of the Samaritan on the road to Jericho almost more than any other?" or "How can we square the political dogma that undergirds the fantasy of a missile defense system with the need to treat America as but one member in a community of nations under a "law of peoples?"<br/>The new public philosopher might seek to understand labor law and military and trade theory and doctrine as much as theories of surplus value; the logic of international markets and trade agreements as much as critiques of commodification, and the politics of complexity as much as the politics of power (all of which can still be done from our arm chairs.) This means going down deep into the guts of our quotidian social institutions, into the grimy pragmatic details where intellectuals are loathe to dwell but where the officers and bureaucrats of those institutions take difficult and often unpleasant, imperfect decisions that affect other peoples' lives, and it means making honest attempts to truly understand how those institutions actually function in the actual world before howling for their overthrow commences. This might help keep us from being slapped down in debates by true policy pros who actually know what they are talking about but who lack awareness of the dogmatic assumptions from which they proceed, and who have not yet found a good reason to listen to jargon-riddled lectures from philosophers and culture critics with their snobish disrespect for the so-called "managerial class."</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>Key to fairness – otherwise they can render 8 minutes of aff speech time irrelevant</p><p>Also most reciprocal – they can have their kritik – just must defend a policy option</p><p>Permute: Critically Endorse The Plan In The Intellectual Space Opened By The Alternative – The Net Benefit Is That The K By Itself Is A Self-Destructive Monism Of Perspective<br/>Murray, Professor Politics at the University of Wales, 1997 (Alastair J.H., Reconstructing Realism: Between Power Politics and Cosmopolitan Ethics, p. 193-6)<br/>For realism man remains, in the final analysis, limited by himself. As such, it emphasizes caution, and focuses not merely upon the achievement of long-term objectives, but also upon the resolution of more- immediate difficulties. Given that, in the absence of a resolution of such difficulties, longer-term objectives are liable to be unachievable, realism would seem to offer a more effective strategy of transition than relativism itself. Whereas, in constructivism, such strategies are divorced from an awareness of the immediate problems which obstruct such efforts, and, in critical theoretical perspectives, they are divorced from the current realities of international politics altogether, realism's emphasis on first addressing the immediate obstacles to development ensures that it at least generates strategies which offer us a tangible path to follow. If these strategies perhaps lack the visionary appeal of reflectivist proposals, emphasizing simply the necessity of a restrained moderate diplomacy in order to ameliorate conflicts between states, to foster a degree of mutual understanding in international relations, and, ultimately, to develop a sense of community which might underlie a more comprehensive international society, they at least seek to take advantage of the possibilities of reform in the current international system without jeopardizing the possibilities of order. Realism's gradualist reformism, the careful tending of what it regards as an essentially organic process, ultimately suggests the basis for a more sustainable strategy for reform than reflectivist perspectives, however dramatic, can offer. For the realist, then, if rationalist theories prove so conservative as to make their adoption problematic, critical theories prove so progressive as to make their adoption unattractive. If the former can justifiably be criticized for seeking to make a far from ideal order work more efficiently, thus perpetuating its existence and legitimating its errors, reflectivist theory can equally be criticized for searching for a tomorrow which may never exist, thereby endangering the possibility of establishing any form of stable order in the here and now. Realism's distinctive contribution thus lies in its attempt to drive a path between the two, a path which, in the process, suggests the basis on which some form of synthesis between rationalism and relativism might be achieved. Oriented in its genesis towards addressing the shortcomings in an idealist transformatory project, it is centrally motivated by concern to reconcile vision with practicality, to relate utopia and reality. Unifying technical and a practical stance, it combines aspects of the positivist methodology employed by problem-solving theory with the interpretative stance adopted by critical theory, avoiding the monism of perspective which leads to the self-destructive conflict between the two. Ultimately, it can simultaneously acknowledge the possibility of change in the structure of the international system and the need to probe the limits of the possible, and yet also question the proximity of any international transformation, emphasize the persistence of problems after such a transformation, and serve as a reminder of the need to grasp whatever semblance of order can be obtained in the mean time. Indeed, it is possible to say that realism is uniquely suited to serve as such an orientation. Simultaneously to critique contemporary resolutions of the problem of political authority as unsatisfactory and yet to support them as an attainable measure of order in an unstable world involves one in a contradiction which is difficult to accept. Yet, because it grasps the essential ambiguity of the political, and adopts imperfectionism as its dominant motif, realism can relate these two tasks in a way which allows neither to predominate, achieving, if not a reconciliation, then at least a viable synthesis. Perhaps the most famous realist refrain is that all politics are power politics. It is the all that is important here. Realism lays claim to a relevance across systems, and because it relies on a conception of human nature, rather than a historically specific structure of world politics, it can make good on this claim. If its observations about human nature are even remotely accurate, the problems that it addresses will transcend contingent formulations of the problem of political order. Even in a genuine cosmopolis, conflict might become technical, but it would not be eliminated altogether.67 The primary manifestations of power might become more economic or institutional rather than (para)military but, where disagreements occur and power exists, the employment of the one to ensure the satisfactory resolution of the other is inevitable short of a wholesale transformation of human behaviour. Power is ultimately of the essence of politics; it is not something which can be banished, only tamed and restrained. As a result, realism achieves a universal relevance to the problem of political action which allows it to relate the reformist zeal of critical theory, without which advance would be impossible, with the problem-solver's sensible caution that before reform is attempted, whatever measure of security is possible under contemporary conditions must first be ensured</p><p>Utopian fiat is bad – not reciprocal since we are stuck to the resolution – and also sidesteps the core literature base of the topic – also forces the 2AC to spend extra time to compensate</p><p>One size fits all views of the world like the kritik undermine any real understanding of the world – our vision is key<br/>Guzzini, Senior Research Fellow at the Copenhagen Peace Research Institute and Associate Professor of Political Science, International Relations, and European Studies at the Central European University in Budapest, 3-2K2 (Stefano, “The enduring dilemmas of realism in International Relations,” located at: <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.ciaonet.org/wps/gus02.pdf)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.ciaonet.org/wps/gus02.pdf)%27" tppabs="http://www.ciaonet.org/wps/gus02.pdf)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.ciaonet.org/wps/gus02.pdf)</span></a></span><br/>The negative implications of seeing realism on the level of observation differently defined than on the level of practice, double and not only simple negation, stem from the curious assumption that the language of observation has to imitate the language of practice for understanding it.111 This does not follow, however.

The particular under¬standing of language makes any security utterance potentially se¬curitizing. Consequently, enunciating security is never innocent or neutral. Of course, this does not have to result in a normative dilemma; it does so only if one wants to or has to utter security in a political context while wanting to avoid a securitization of a par¬ticular area. Someone may also employ security language with the intention of securitizing an area. This does not necessarily require a conservative interest in keeping the status quo or in establishing law and order. Securitization can also be performed with an emancipatory interest. Given the capacity of security language to priori¬tize questions and to mobilize people, one may employ it as a tac¬tical device to give human-rights questions a higher visibility, for example. It is also possible to mobilize security questions in nonse¬curity areas with the intention to change the conservative bias of the security language.

But such testimonials are usually from activists who were neither paralyzed nor numb in the first place, whose fear was maintained at reasonable levels by their own activism, and who derived new energy and reinforcement from what people in the adjacent seats may well have found intolerable. Our wager is that the fear speeches revitalize the committed into renewed action, startle the apathetic into fresh attention, and torment the terrorized and the numb into starker terror and deeper numbness.<br/>In a set of guidelines for “Helping People Deal With Terrifying Films,” Frances Peavey advised readers in 1981: “Do not stand up after the film is over and try to scare people with further horrifying facts. This is a violent act and does not encourage peace. When people are subjected to too much fear-provoking material, they tend toward numbing, forgetting or feeling so violated that they are hostile to the overall message.”(12) At that time Peavey still saw value in terrifying films, so long as the discussion afterward helped people deal with the feelings they aroused. In 1985, when few are apathetic but many are numbed by terror, the value of the films themselves is much reduced.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p> <br/>&nbsp;</p><p>2AC Private Property – Small Farms Add-On</p><p>Property rights key to ag development – its key to the survival of small farms&nbsp;</p><p>Hosemann 2k5<br/>(John Hosemann retired in June 2000 as chief economist and Director of the Public Policy Division of the American Farm Bureau Federation.

Given the variations in weather, pests, and the natural biological processes, it is essential that farm and ranch operators maintain the capacity to make production and marketing decisions quickly. These decisions can not be made without the right to own, use, and dispose of property. Socialized farming, dramatically illustrated by the failed central planning of the former Soviet Union, is inefficient at best, disastrous at worst. It leads to higher- cost output in terms of lost human capital, slower decision-making, and missed opportunities. &nbsp;United States agriculture has existed in a private property setting, and that is undoubtedly one reason for its success. However, over the past thirty years, the federal government has increased its role in farming through various subsidies and the regulation of land, water and air. Massive amounts of money were transferred to farmers from taxpayers to try to keep incomes to farmers higher than market forces would allow–over the last thirty years, an estimated $275 billion federal dollars have been transferred from taxpayers to farmers. In addition, the U.S. taxpayer has provided over the same period an estimated $85 billion to support agricultural research at public universities. Other government programs have reduced farm and agribusiness risks through subsidized credit, subsidized crop insurance programs, and subsidized domestic and export sales. Together, these programs have led to more output than would have otherwise been the case. &nbsp;Most of the government subsidies were adopted in the name of "saving the family farm," a political myth that has guided farm politicians since the 1930s. After almost 70 years of this myth, there are fewer family farms than ever. Indeed, most of the federal farm welfare has gone to larger- scale commercial farms, units with annual sales of $250,000 or more. The average net worth of these units is almost four times that of the average taxpayer, who provides these transfers. The economic returns to these farms are competitive with non-farm businesses of similar size. &nbsp;The industrialization of agriculture has permanently diverted agriculture from the small-farm Jeffersonian model. This industrialization has been driven by the need for food-processing firms to control all aspects of food production to assure quality for consumers and to meet the demands of federal food safety and product liability laws. &nbsp;The resulting concentration of livestock production in beef feedlots, vertical hog and poultry systems, and large dairy production units, has given rise to criticism by environmentalists, some consumers, and those within agriculture who favor small community-based farming and marketing. Yet the larger concentrated animal units are more likely to adopt advanced environmental systems because they can allocate the higher fixed costs (of, say, waste handling and disposal, an example here) investments over greater output. Smaller "family" farms are unable to make similar financial commitments. &nbsp;Without government subsidies, farm consolidations would have occurred due to economies of scale and the need for "conception to consumption" control of food processing. However, subsidies accelerated the process by disproportionately supporting large farms. Without government subsidies, technology would have advanced, but more of it would have taken place through on-farm trial and error research and experimentation, where the individual farmer took risks, rather than land grant universities and experiment stations. The rate of progress would have been slower. It is virtually impossible to separate the good and the bad impacts of these subsidies on the environment. &nbsp;As government subsidies supported agriculture, a network of constraining environmental regulations also emerged. Government regulation of land and water shifted from giving technical and educational support to conservation-minded farmers to the imposition of criminal penalties on farmers for carrying out routine farm practices. The cost of regulation to farmers may well be $20 billion per year, or more. &nbsp;Federal Intervention in Agriculture &nbsp;To understand environmental conditions in agriculture today, one must understand the modern history of federal intervention in agriculture, and the national and international conditions that shaped it. Perhaps the most important factor was the inflation that started in the late 1960s, when the Federal Reserve Bank essentially printed money to finance federal budget deficits. The goal was to fund both the Vietnam War and the "Great Society" social welfare programs. As typically occurs when the monetary supply is expanded beyond productivity gains, inflation began. It reached progressively higher levels during most of the 1970s. &nbsp;Commodity prices soared. Soybeans reached an historical high price of over ten dollars per bushel. (Today soybeans are in the four- to five-dollars per bushel range.) Inflationary expectations became the rule in farm business decision-making. Many farmers began speculating in land and machinery, betting that prices would go higher. Viewing inflation as a permanent condition, farmers increased their debt. The bidding for farmland by farmers and nonfarm speculators escalated. Used farm equipment often sold for as much or more than it cost when purchased new. As farmland prices increased, so did the assessed valuation for property tax purposes, and local governments jumped on the inflationary spending bandwagon. &nbsp;In their zeal to stay ahead of inflation, most farmers pursued short term decision-making to the detriment of the longer term decision-making. This affected the bedrock of land and water conservation: the environment. Aided by government farm programs, farmers clearcut and drained large tracts of forest land, particularly in the Mississippi River Delta region but also in the mid-Atlantic states. In the heartland, taking advantage of rising grain prices, farmers converted pastureland to cropland. Historically, pasture has generally been land with rougher terrain that is more prone to erosion. The inflationary period thus laid the foundation for criticisms of farm land and water resource use in the years ahead. &nbsp;The inflationary era set in motion political forces which remain today as farmers lobbied for and received higher guaranteed government prices that were repeatedly adjusted for inflation. But the inflation did not last forever. When it reached double-digit levels in 1979, Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker applied the monetary policy brakes by allowing interest rates to rise. Interest rates soon reached double-digit levels and began the process of slowing inflation, a process that continued during the 1980s and early 1990s. In fact, controlling inflation became the preoccupation of the Federal Reserve and most politicians and remains the major Fed concern today. &nbsp;As inflation came under control, farmers benefited from the lower costs of farm inputs, but the long-term economic damage to the farm sector during the inflationary period had been done. Many farmers had leveraged inflated land values into enormous debt loads that could not be serviced out of the output from crops and livestock. In 1986, the federal government bailed out the Farm Credit System (a quasi-governmental subsidized credit system for farmers and ranchers and agri-businesses). Interest rates on farm credit system loans were generally lower than market interest rates because the system could borrow money at the same rate as the federal government), which owned a substantial share of the speculative bad debt on farms. Debt restructuring became commonplace, and farms consolidated, shifting resources to operators with stronger financial positions. Once the economic stagnation of the late 1970s hit, the inflated prices produced a buildup of government commodity stocks. In 1983 the Payment-In-Kind (the federal PIK program gave certificates to farmers for the grain they had put in federal storage. The certificates could be used to redeem the grain to use on farms or to sell.) program was initiated to reduce government held commodity stocks as federal budget deficits soared.1 &nbsp;In addition to a tightened money supply, worldwide supply-driven deflation was beginning. Raw material prices, including farm commodity prices, declined worldwide, and continue in mid-2001 to remain low. The commodity price index was at or near its lowest level in fifteen years. The Federal Reserve preoccupied with fighting inflation, continued to tightened the money supply even further until the late 1990s. Farm prices were caught in this tidal wave of downward economic pressure. Yet American farmers were insulated by government programs. Between 1997 and 2002 under the 1996 farm law, farmers will have received over $104 billion in welfare transfers. &nbsp;Another factor affecting the farm economy during the past thirty years was the two major embargoes. Embargoes are government restrictions on exports. The first embargo in the early 1970s was a government response to inflated food prices, especially of soybeans and soy products. The government banned exports to bring prices down and appease angry consumers. The second embargo, in early 1980, was a grain embargo against the Soviet Union for its invasion of Afghanistan. At the farm level, both embargoes caused a drop in prices, which led farmers and their organizations to demand that the government do something to offset the negative price impact. &nbsp;Farm Policy: Short-Term Political Responses &nbsp;Against this backdrop, major farm laws were passed. Most of them were short-term political responses to events and policies external to the farm economy. But these federal welfare subsidies put the recipients in a better financial position to funnel some of the subsidies back into political campaigns to reelect politicians who faithfully protect the farm welfare payment system. This special interest perpetual motion machine gives farmers and their political incumbents (both Democrat and Republican) a big advantage at reelection time given the marginal value of the farm vote. Both parties became adept in the vote-getting business. &nbsp;Welfare transfers to farmers take a variety of forms.2 One of the mainstays of government farm programs until the 1996 low was target prices. Target prices were politically determined price levels. If market prices fell below these target prices, the federal government made up the difference through cash payments based on the production level at the farm. Government loan rates, also set by politicians, are the prices a farmer receives at harvest time for cotton, rice, corn, soybeans, wheat, other feedgrains, and sugar. If the market price is below the loan rate at the end of the contract period (usually 9 or 10 months), the government essentially buys the commodity at the loan rates. The government is stuck with it and stockpiles generally accumulate when prices are low. &nbsp;Because these price support programs are expensive, efforts have been made to limit their cost over the years. Thus, the 1973, 1978, 1981, and 1985 laws included acreage reduction programs (ARPs). (The 1996 farm law abandoned ARPs, giving farmers the flexibility to plant whatever mix of crops and acreage they chose.) By limiting acres for production, it was thought, federal outlays were controlled. &nbsp;The basic economic problem with acreage reduction and crop set-asides is that it changes the incentives of farmers. Giving up crop output is costly for the individual farm. So, in response to these limits, individual producers used more fertilizers, pesticides, and new technologies to maximize yields on the acres they were allowed to plant. Thus, acreage restrictions set the stage for potential environmental impacts, particularly the impact of water running off the intensively cropped acres and reaching streams and rivers. Furthermore, when ARPs and other set-asides are returned to production, substantially more soil preparation, weed and pest control are required before planting. &nbsp;Acreage reduction programs had another impact: They spurred more production by foreign competitors. This had its own environmental fallout, especially over the longer run. Particularly in the southern hemisphere, large areas of forestland and pastures were cleared for crop production. &nbsp;Conservation Reserve Program: Environmentalists' Success? &nbsp;By 1985, environmental critics of farm policy had built a strong case that the federal government's acreage reduction programs had increased the use of fertilizers and pesticides on the acres that farmers were allowed to cultivate. These chemicals have been alleged to pollute streams and rivers. &nbsp;To combat this problem, the 1985 farm law introduced the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). Ironically, this solution was another set-aside program, but one that would pay farmers to take erodible or marginal land out of production. &nbsp;The federal government rents the CRP acreage from landowners under ten- year contracts, paying farmers for agreeing to keep land fallow for ten years. For the most part, CRP acres return to weed and brush growth without much maintenance and upkeep. An estimated thirty-five million acres annually have been removed from crop production, at a cost of about $2 billion per year without proven real environmental gains. &nbsp;The CRP was a response not only to the environmental critics but also to farmers who were looking for another way to receive government payments. Hunters threw their political weight behind the CRP, too, because they believed it would expand habitat for hunting. 3 This latter point has been debatable. &nbsp;The environmental appeal was that by idling these cropland acres, soil and water would automatically improve since there would be no pesticides, fertilizers or soil erosion from the idled acreage. This assumption did not take into account the runoff from remaining acres which were more intensively cropped, however. Furthermore, this theory has not been proven scientifically. The CRP became yet another government program for transferring money. Some of it went to farmers but money also went to absentee landowners, retired farmers, and land speculators. &nbsp;In fact, realtors selling property around many large metropolitan areas sometimes use CRP payments as an enticement to urbanites to purchase rural properties. The payments come in because the land is not being farmed. In some instances, CRP payments offset the annual property tax payments. As with other federal programs, there is a contradiction: Environmental groups rail against urban expansion but, on the other hand, they support subsidies to encourage it. &nbsp;In addition to farm program subsidies like the CRP, direct cost-sharing subsidies have supported farmers' efforts to carry out specific conservation practices such as building stock and retention ponds, grass waterways, and contour terraces. &nbsp;For example, corn and soybeans are now planted in marginal production areas. With the government's soybean loan rate higher than the corn loan rate, the incentive is to plant more soybean acres. Minimum tillage and no-tillage technologies coupled with the introduction of genetically modified seeds have enabled producers to produce soybeans, corn, and cotton more cheaply, and government incentives encourage them to do it on some lands with erosion and water runoff problems. &nbsp;Environmental Regulations Bring Conflict &nbsp;Major environmental laws have also affected environmental conditions on the farm, although most of these effects came long after passage of the pollution control laws. For farmers, the first major environmental regulations were those governing the use of chemicals in fruits and vegetable production under amendments to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA, in 1972). Reentry rules were adopted governing the length of time between chemical applications and when hired farm workers could reenter the treated fields. When the Environmental Protection Agency was formed, one of its first acts was a ban on the pesticide DDT in 1972, followed by other bans on chemicals the agency considered harmful. &nbsp;The first major conflict between farmers and the Clean Water Act was the arbitrary enforcement of wetland rules by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in the 1980s. The definition of "waters of the United States" was expanded by the federal government to include, literally, isolated mud puddles in the midst of cropping areas. This expansion of federal control got the attention of farmers because most farmers have producing areas which are wet at least twenty-one days during some part of the year and under the government's regulatory definition, that&nbsp;</em></p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2AC Private Property – Small Farms Add-On</p><p>could be a wetland. &nbsp;Gradually, federal environmental involvement in agriculture shifted away from technical support and education to the criminalization of environmental rules, especially under the Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act. This shift was at basic odds with the tradition <br/>in agriculture of having land-grant universities and the Soil Conservation Service define conservation problems, conduct research on alternative solutions, and use the federal/state Cooperative Extension Service to educate farmers about how to solve the problem at hand. Contour farming, grass waterways, retention ponds, stock ponds, and forestry practices, are good examples of this effort. Farm ponds are often described as man-made wetlands. &nbsp;Expansion of federal regulatory controls in the 1980s, including restrictions under the Endangered Species Act and the Clean Water Act, gave rise to the property rights movement across the country. Generally those who became most active in the movement were farmers and landowners who had experienced a direct confrontation with federal authorities over some regulatory restriction of their cropland, pastureland or forest land. Mixed Environmental Results &nbsp;The shift in federal enforcement of land and water use rules has had the unintended consequence of increasing farm size, reinforcing the natural tendency toward consolidation and the effects of government subsidies. Farm units have grown larger to accommodate the higher scientific, legal, and other costs of federal environmental intervention. Today many larger poultry, hog, and dairy operations have water quality programs that meet or exceed federal and state standards.&nbsp;</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>Loss of small farms causes extinction</p><p>Boyce 4 (James K.

Or, to be more precise, there can be and should be a future for them.Given the dependence of 'modern' low-diversity agriculture on 'traditional' high-diversity agriculture, the long-term food security of humankind will depend on small farms and their continued provision of the environmental service of in situ conservation of crop genetic diversity. Policies to support small farms can be advocated, therefore, not merely as a matter of sympathy, or nostalgia, or equity. Such policies are also a matter of human survival. The diversity that underpins the sustainability of world agriculture did not fall from the sky. It was bequeathed to us by the 400 generations of farmerswho have carried on the process of artificial selection since plants were first domesticated.Until recently, we took this diversity for granted. The ancient reservoirs of crop genetic diversity, plant geneticist Jack Harlan (1975, p. 619) wrote three decades ago, 'seemed to most people as inexhaustible as oil in Arabia.' Yet, Harlan warned, 'the speed which enormous crop diversity can be essentially wiped out is astonishing.' The central thesis of this essay is thatefforts to conserve in situ diversity must go hand-in-hand with efforts to support the small farmers around the world who sustain this diversity. Economists and environmentalists alike by and large have neglected this issue. In thrall to a myopic notion of efficiency, many economists fail to appreciate that diversity is the sine qua non of resilience and sustainability.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>And Collapse of US agriculture makes all your impacts inevitable and culminates in human extinction</p><p>Lugar 2k<br/>(Richard, a US Senator from Indiana, is Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and a member and former chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. “calls for a new green revolution to combat global warming and reduce world instability,” pg online @ <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.unep.org/OurPlanet/imgversn/143/lugar.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.unep.org/OurPlanet/imgversn/143/lugar.html%27" tppabs="http://www.unep.org/OurPlanet/imgversn/143/lugar.html"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.unep.org/OurPlanet/imgversn/143/lugar.html</span></a></span> <em>ghs-ef)<br/>In a world confronted by global terrorism, turmoil in the Middle East, burgeoning nuclear threats and other crises, it is easy to lose sight of the long-range challenges. But we do so at our peril. One of the most daunting of them is meeting the world’s need for food and energy in this century. At stake is not only preventing starvation and saving the environment, but also world peace and security. History tells us that states may go to war over access to resources, and that poverty and famine have often bred fanaticism and terrorism. Working to feed the world will minimize factors that contribute to global instability and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. &nbsp;&nbsp;With the world population expected to grow from 6 billion people today to 9 billion by mid-century, the demand for affordable food will increase well beyond current international production levels. People in rapidly developing nations will have the means greatly to improve their standard of living and caloric intake. Inevitably, that means eating more meat. This will raise demand for feed grain at the same time that the growing world population will need vastly more basic food to eat. &nbsp;Complicating a solution to this problem is a dynamic that must be better understood in the West: developing countries often use <br/>limited arable land to expand cities to house their growing populations. As good land disappears, people destroy timber resources and even rainforests as they try to create more arable land to feed themselves. The long-term environmental consequences could be disastrous for the entire globe. &nbsp;&nbsp;Productivity revolution &nbsp;To meet the expected demand for food over the next 50 years, we in the United States will have to grow roughly three times more food on the land we have. That’s a tall order. My farm in Marion County, Indiana, for example, yields on average 8.3 to 8.6 tonnes of corn per hectare – typical for a farm in central Indiana. To triple our production by 2050, we will have to produce an annual average of 25 tonnes per hectare. &nbsp;&nbsp;Can we possibly boost output that much? Well, it’s been done before. Advances in the use of fertilizer and water, improved machinery and better tilling techniques combined to generate a threefold increase in yields since 1935 – on our farm back then, my dad produced 2.8 to 3 tonnes per hectare. Much US agriculture has seen similar increases. &nbsp;&nbsp;But of course there is no guarantee that we can achieve those results again. Given the urgency of expanding food production to meet world demand, we must invest much more in scientific research and target that money toward projects that promise to have significant national and global impact. For the United States, that will mean a major shift in the way we conduct and fund agricultural science. Fundamental research will generate the innovations that will be necessary to feed the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;The United States can take a leading position in a productivity revolution. And our success at increasing food production may play a decisive humanitarian role in the survival of billions of people and the health of our planet.</em></p></div></div></td><td>9/16/13</td></tr><tr><td style="width:100%; word-break:break-all; word-break:break-word;"><div><p><input onclick="saveEntry(7)" src="../../xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" tppabs="http://hspolicy13.debatecoaches.org/xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" style="float:right;" title="Save" type="image" value="Save"></input>
