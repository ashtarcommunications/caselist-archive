But this course of action wouldn’t address most of the concerns about drones.<br/>Taliban control would be far more disruptive to the daily lives of those living in <br/>AND<br/>which to continue its operations against American and Afghan forces across the border.<br/>The second option would be for Pakistan’s military to assert control over the region. However, its last serious attempt to do so — the Swat Valley campaign of 2009 — utilized armored vehicles, artillery and airstrikes to try to dislodge about 5,000 Taliban fighters. This resulted in the displacement of more than 1 million civilians who fled the army’s indiscriminate firepower.<br/>Last year, mere rumors that the Pakistani military was planning a campaign in Waziristan caused thousands to flee. Pakistan lacks both the desire and the capacity to pursue another campaign to gain control of the tribal areas, and any attempt to conduct such a campaign would be a humanitarian nightmare for the civilians who live there.<br/>The third option would be for the United States to use ground troops and special forces to conduct counterinsurgency operations in the tribal areas. Even if Pakistan were willing to publicly consent to American ground forces on its territory, an issue that it has carefully finessed in the context of drone operations, it is unlikely that this option would alleviate any of the frequently voiced concerns about the use of drones.<br/>If operations in Afghanistan are any guide, using ground troops would result in as many or more civilian casualties than the current drone campaign and would be more deeply unpopular in Pakistan — not to mention that it would result in higher U.S. casualties. Ground operations in territory controlled by the Taliban would still rely heavily on drone surveillance, and most raids would occur at night.<br/>Such operations in Afghanistan were so unpopular and disruptive of daily life that President Hamid Karzai insisted that continued Afghan cooperation with the United States was contingent on Afghan control over night raids.<br/>The final option is the continued use of drones. Even according to the least <br/>AND<br/>drones have done this while consistently improving their accuracy and reducing civilian casualties.<br/>After examining the alternatives, it is clear that drones remain the best option available to minimize the negative effects of the conflict on civilians while continuing to disrupt the Taliban and deny it control of territory in the tribal areas.</p><p>Pakistani instability escalates to nuclear war.<br/>Pitt 09 – a New York Times and internationally bestselling author of two books: "War on Iraq: What Team Bush Doesn’t Want You to Know" and "The Greatest Sedition Is Silence."

Spies became soldiers.<br/>Mazzetti writes that after 9/11, the C.I.A. director morphed into "a military commander running a clandestine, global war with a skeleton staff and very little oversight." Why did the C.I.A., as Gen. James Cartwright asked when he was the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, need to build "a second Air Force"?<br/>Leon Panetta made the C.I.A. far more militarized and then went to the Pentagon. When an actual military commander, David Petraeus, became head spook in 2011, he embraced the drone program, pushed to expand the fleet and conducted the first robo-targeted killing of an American citizen.<br/>"A spy agency that on September 11, 2001, had been decried as bumbling and risk-averse had, under the watchful eye of four successive C.I.A. directors, gone on a killing spree," Mazzetti writes.<br/>The C.I.A. now has a drone base in Saudi Arabia, and both the Pentagon and the spy agency are running parallel drone wars in Yemen, each fighting for resources. And the Pentagon continues its foray into human spying. As W. George Jameson, a lawyer who spent 33 years at the C.I.A., lamented: "Everything is backwards. You’ve got an intelligence agency fighting a war and a military organization trying to gather on-the-ground intelligence."<br/>Mazzetti observes that the C.I.A., playing catch-up through so much of the Arab Spring, has turned a perilous corner, where a new generation at Langley much prefers "the adrenaline rush of being at the front lines" hunting and killing to the more patient, tedious, "gentle" work of intelligence gathering and espionage. Relying on foreign spies for counterterrorism information can blind you to what is really happening on the ground.<br/>Ross Newland, a career clandestine officer, told Mazzetti that the allure of killing people by remote control is "catnip," and that the agency should have given up Predators and Reapers long ago. The death robots have turned the C.I.A. into the villain in places like Pakistan, Newland said, where the agency’s mission is supposed to be nurturing relationships to gather intelligence.</p><p>Institutional inertia means now is key<br/>Scahill 12 – (11/14, Jeremy, Puffin Foundation Writing Fellow at The Nation Institute, an award-winning investigative journalist, author of Dirty Wars and Blackwater, "The Petraeus Legacy: A Paramilitary CIA?" <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.thenation.com/article/171247/petraeus-legacy-paramilitary-cia~~23axzz2YPwmfs7A-http://www.thenation.com/article/171247/petraeus-legacy-paramilitary-cia)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path excluded from retrieval by the project\%27s Exclusions properties.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.thenation.com/article/171247/petraeus-legacy-paramilitary-cia~~23axzz2YPwmfs7A-http://www.thenation.com/article/171247/petraeus-legacy-paramilitary-cia)%27" tppabs="http://www.thenation.com/article/171247/petraeus-legacy-paramilitary-cia~~23axzz2YPwmfs7A-http://www.thenation.com/article/171247/petraeus-legacy-paramilitary-cia)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.thenation.com/article/171247/petraeus-legacy-paramilitary-cia~~23axzz2YPwmfs7A-http://www.thenation.com/article/171247/petraeus-legacy-paramilitary-cia)</span></a></span>&nbsp;</p><p>While much of the media focus on l’affaire Petraeus has centered on the CIA director’s <br/>AND<br/>to the helm of the CIA, is a symbol of this evolution.<br/>"I would not say that CIA has been taken over by the military, but I would say that the CIA has become more militarized," Philip Giraldi, a retired career CIA case officer, told The Nation.

At the core, it is a conventional military action. <br/>The Pakistanis today complain of a drone campaign out of control and they are right<br/>AND<br/>technologically-driven covert operation has arguably reached the point of no return. <br/>This is not an intelligence approach; it is a military one. Today’s CIA <br/>AND<br/>, but increasingly the intelligence agencies are cast as adjuncts to the military.<br/>The high "operational tempo" demanded by Director Michael Hayden, Panetta’s predecessor, in fact required the CIA to work more like the military, discarding careful intelligence work in favor of "actionable intelligence," further emphasizing technical collection programs. Under Director David Petraeus, another general, it is a safe prediction that this trend will continue. <br/>Under Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, the Pentagon moved strongly to supplant CIA operations<br/>AND<br/>to say this has been made easier as the agency became more militarized. <br/>In Presidents’ Secret Wars, written amid the excesses of Reagan-era covert operations<br/>AND<br/>refine its decision devices, and be placed within a proper legal framework. <br/>This brings us to the final, legal questions. I have consistently held, and still do, that no legal authority for covert operations exists under the U.S. Constitution. The underpinning for presidential approval of covert operations rests entirely on the ambiguous "such other functions" clause of the National Security Act of 1947. The CIA’s own General Counsel concluded on multiple occasions that covert operations did not fall within the scope of that language. <br/>Should the President instead rely upon his authority as Commander in Chief of the armed <br/>AND<br/>, but the fact remains that it is the law of the land. <br/>Alternatively, were the CIA to be construed as an unofficial armed force for the purpose of conducting paramilitary action – which is, after all, an act of force – then the Constitution (Article I, Section 8) expressly reserves to the Congress all authority to issue "Letters of Marque." The eighteenth century equivalent of grants of unofficial combatant status, given to privateers, Letters of Marque authorize the use of force by private individuals (read CIA operatives). <br/>The system of "presidential findings" ("Memoranda of Notification") that exists today was cobbled together through the 1970s and 1980s by a Congress anxious to assert some sort of oversight and an Executive eager to avoid it. These presidential findings are functional equivalents of Letters of Marque. Since statutory law does not and cannot supersede the Constitution, the current system still fails to meet constitutional requirements. <br/>Congress and the Executive spent more than a decade from the 1980s into the 1990s <br/>AND<br/>issue left outstanding in the 1990s – what constituted "current" notification. <br/>The proper constitutional solution under Article I, Section 8, is to craft a mechanism for congressional approval of presidential findings. That would locate responsibility squarely and settle the matter of definitions. Congress would be entitled to whatever information is required to reach its decisions, and its affirmative action would give covert operations a degree of political cover they presently lack. <br/>The legitimate vehicle for the expression of this formula is a CIA charter, or <br/>AND<br/>long overdue, and its necessity has only been confirmed by recent excesses.</p><p>There’s no substantive difference between CIA and DOD control <br/>Waxman 13 – (3/20, Matthew, law professor at Columbia Law School, co-chair, Roger Hertog Program on Law and National Security, Adjunct Senior Fellow for Law and Foreign Policy at the Council on Foreign Relations, member of the Hoover Institution Task Force on National Security and Law, "Going Clear," Foreign Policy, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/03/20/going_clear?wp_login_redirect=0)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/03/20/going_clear?wp_login_redirect=0)%27" tppabs="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/03/20/going_clear?wp_login_redirect=0)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/03/20/going_clear?wp_login_redirect=0)</span></a></span></p><p>Although technically "covert" and carried out under statutory and presidential authorities designed to <br/>AND<br/>is in charge because of the secrecy and impunity with which it operates.<br/>In truth, critics often underestimate oversight of CIA activities and overestimate the openness of <br/>AND<br/>Congress to speak more clearly and openly about general policy in this area.<br/>With regard to the legal rules that govern targeting, it may be that shifting <br/>AND<br/>do, on account of tradition, institutional culture, and legal requirements.</p></div></div></td><td>3/28/14</td></tr><tr><td style="width:100%; word-break:break-all; word-break:break-word;"><div><p><input onclick="saveEntry(81)" src="../../xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" tppabs="http://opencaselist13.paperlessdebate.com/xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" style="float:right;" title="Save" type="image" value="Save"></input>

Why do I think so?<br/>One obvious reason is the lack of common external enemy. Historically, that is the only reason why the United States was willing to commit troops to Europe, and it is therefore no surprise that America’s military presence in Europe has declined steadily ever since the Soviet Union broke up. Simply put: there is no threat to Europe that the Europeans cannot cope with on their own, and thus little role for Americans to play.<br/>In addition, the various imperial adventures that NATO has engaged in since 1992 haven’t <br/>AND<br/>positive that the alliance can accomplish anywhere else, then what’s it for?<br/>Lastly, transatlantic security cooperation will decline because the United States will be shifting its <br/>AND<br/>U.S. foreign policy establishment, and Europe will get less. &nbsp;<br/>This trend will be reinforced by demographic and generational changes on both sides of the Atlantic, as the percentage of Americans with strong ancestral connections to Europe declines and as the generation that waged the Cold War leaves the stage.

John McCain, R-Ariz., a senior Armed Services Committee member, told Defense News on Wednesday, just before Congress left for a weeklong recess, that he will push the issue when the panel crafts its 2015 Pentagon policy bill in coming months.<br/>"We’re going to have that debate," McCain said in a brief interview. "There is no doubt about it."<br/>McCain’s comments come weeks after he expressed disgust with language reportedly inserted into the classified portion of a Pentagon-funding section of an omnibus spending bill blocking the shift of the drone program from the CIA to the military.<br/>The administration of President Barack Obama last year signaled it wanted to move most — or all — of the program from the spy agency to the military. But that plan hit a number of legal and operational snags, and was not fully completed before Congress passed the omnibus.<br/>But McCain says the fight isn’t over.<br/>"I would like to make sure they are cooperating with other countries," McCain said, referring to concerns among some lawmakers and analysts that the Obama administration avoids getting clearance from leaders of countries before flying drones into their airspace.<br/>"Mostly, I want to see it moved over to DoD. That’s my primary goal," McCain said.<br/>Many analysts say that other than possibly taking up a new immigration reform measure, Congress likely is finished with major legislation this year. The mid-term election cycle is in full swing, and both parties seem content to battle it out back home after five years of bitter partisan fights here.<br/>But Congress is expected, as it has for 52 consecutive years, to pass a defense authorization bill. And McCain’s intentions will revive a battle between two powerful camps on Capitol Hill.<br/>Lawmakers on both sides of the debate have strong opinions about whether it is the job of the military or intelligence community to kill al-Qaida leaders and operatives. And behind the issue of whether the CIA should be firing missiles from remotely piloted aircraft is a simmering congressional turf war between the chambers’ Armed Services and Intelligence committees.<br/>If the Defense Department is handed control of the CIA’s armed drone fleet and strike missions against al-Qaida targets, it would also gain what intelligence analysts say is the program’s sizable budget and control over one of the White House’s primary tactics for combating the terrorist group.<br/>On one side are pro-military lawmakers like McCain. They believe the military should be the US entity charged with killing America’s foes, and that the CIA should get back to collecting and analyzing intelligence.<br/>On the other side are members like Senate Intelligence Committee Chairwoman Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. These members, largely Democrats, are skeptical of the military’s ability to use what they see as the CIA’s rigorous decision process before carrying out armed strikes. ?&nbsp;</p><p>Obama is currently losing – gets blamed for Congress’ reversal</p></div></div></td><td>3/28/14</td></tr><tr><td style="width:100%; word-break:break-all; word-break:break-word;"><div><p><input onclick="saveEntry(78)" src="../../xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" tppabs="http://opencaselist13.paperlessdebate.com/xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" style="float:right;" title="Save" type="image" value="Save"></input>

Every poll showed that drone strikes were acceptable to a majority within the US. Across all eight polls, the lowest value for approval (53) was nearly twice as large as the highest value for disapproval (28).¶ These results for the 2013 US polls stand in marked contrast to the results from nineteen other countries polled in 2012 by Pew Research’s Global Attitudes Project. In no other country is there majority support for US drone strikes. In the UK and India, opinion is close to evenly split, but all other countries show strong majorities opposed to the drone strikes. In predominantly Muslim countries, approval of US drone strikes is often in single digits.¶ Although the eight US polls cover only six months of 2013, it is possible to see some change in US opinion about drone strikes against terrorists. The three YouGov/Huffington Post polls indicate a slight increase in disapproval (18 opposed rising to 22), with the Wall Street Journal/NBC polls showing a similar increase (12 opposed rising to 16). Neither of these trends is particularly large.¶ Combining the three YouGov/Huffington polls with three other polls using similar wording does show an increase over time in the percentage of respondents who disapprove of the drone strikes (18 rising to 28). It is interesting to note that neither the Approve nor Unsure responses show anywhere near this clear a trend; the Unsure and Approve categories fluctuate considerably (having ranges of 24 points and 23 points, respectively). The consistent trend for Disapprove percentages, compared with the inconsistent fluctuations of Unsure and Approve percentages, hints that those who are opposed are more certain of their opinion than others.¶ Thus drones are generally favored by the American public, and the military has found them to be the weapon of choice for asymmetric warfare. However, opposition to drone attacks is high in other countries, and there seems to be growing segment of the US population that is against the use of drones to kill suspected terrorists. The greater consistency of US opponents of drone strikes may give them a political strength beyond their numbers in comparison to the supporters, whose polling numbers fluctuate more. Should drones’ unpopularity in the United States continue to increase, and their unpopularity in other countries persist, they may well become politically impractical, no matter how convenient and cost-effective the technology may be.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HMovingtoTitle10DODauthorityensuresdronelegitimacy2013allowsoversightandguaranteespoliticalbacking." class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Moving to Title 10 DOD authority ensures drone legitimacy – allows oversight and guarantees political backing.</span></h4><p>Waxman 13 – (3/20, Matthew, law professor at Columbia Law School, co-chair, Roger Hertog Program on Law and National Security, Adjunct Senior Fellow for Law and Foreign Policy at the Council on Foreign Relations, member of the Hoover Institution Task Force on National Security and Law, "Going Clear," Foreign Policy, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/03/20/going_clear?wp_login_redirect=0)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/03/20/going_clear?wp_login_redirect=0)%27" tppabs="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/03/20/going_clear?wp_login_redirect=0)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/03/20/going_clear?wp_login_redirect=0)</span></a></span></p><p>So, moving operations to the Pentagon may modestly improve transparency and compliance with the <br/>AND<br/>too, the proposed reforms would put the remaining policy on stronger footing.&nbsp;</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HAlsosolvesinternationalopinionandlegalchallenges2013createsPERCEPTIONofinternationallawcompliance." class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Also solves international opinion and legal challenges – creates PERCEPTION of international law compliance.</span></h4><p>Nauman 12 – (2013, Joshua, JD, LLM, Commander, Judge Advocate General’s Corps, U.S. Navy, "Civilians on the Battlefield: By Using U.S. Civilians in the War on Terror, Is the Pot Calling the Kettle Black?" 91 Neb.

Speci?cally, a critical component of a broader strategy to prevent a nuclear terrorist attack will involve measures directed at weakening al Qaeda’s leaders and eliminating — or at the very least restricting — their sanctuary in the FATA. Because obtaining or building a nuclear device and delivering it to a target would be a dif?cult and expensive operation,89 it is highly likely that any credible plot will originate with al Qaeda’s central leadership, whether its operatives attempt to carry out such an attack on their own or instead ?nance, organize, and coordinate the efforts of one or more af?liates. By themselves, al Qaeda’s various franchises and especially local extremists would likely ?nd an attack of this scale beyond their abilities. In fact, the group’s franchises might not even be tasked to help with such a large and important operation, beyond providing limited logistical support. According to Bruce Hoffman, "high value, ’spectacular’ attacks are entrusted only to al Qaeda’s professional cadre: the most dedicated, committed, and absolutely reliable elements of the movement."90 Therefore, to the extent that its sanctuary in the FATA has allowed al Qaeda’s leadership to regain its strength and plan future operations, the probability that the group might be able to conduct a catastrophic attack at some point in the future has correspondingly increased.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HAttackingtheAlQaedacoreiskey2013they2019reresponsibleforEVERYmajorterroristattacksince92F11" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Attacking the Al Qaeda core is key – they’re responsible for EVERY major terrorist attack since 9/11</span></h4><p>Hoffman 13 – (7/17, Bruce, PhD, international relations, professor, Director of the Center for Security Studies and Director of the Security Studies Program at Georgetown University’s Edmund A.

In an accidental or unauthorized launch or detonation, system safeguards or procedures to maintain control over nuclear weapons fail in such a way that a nuclear weapon or missile launches or explodes without direction from leaders. In a deliberate first attack, the attacking nation decides to attack based on accurate information about the state of affairs. In an inadvertent attack, the attacking nation mistakenly concludes that it is under attack and launches nuclear weapons in what it believes is a counterattack.3 (Brinkmanship strategies incorporate elements of all of the above, in that they involve intentional manipulation of risks from otherwise accidental or inadvertent launches.4 ) ¶ Over the years, nuclear strategy was aimed primarily at minimizing risks of intentional attack through development of deterrence capabilities, though numerous measures were also taken to reduce probabilities of accidents, unauthorized attack, and inadvertent war. For purposes of deterrence, both U.S. and Soviet/Russian forces have maintained significant capabilities to have some forces survive a first attack by the other side and to launch a subsequent counterattack. However, concerns about the extreme disruptions that a first attack would cause in the other side’s forces and command-and-control capabilities led to both sides’ development of capabilities to detect a first attack and launch a counter-attack before suffering damage from the first attack.5¶ Many people believe that with the end of the Cold War and with improved relations between the United States and Russia, the risk of East-West nuclear war was significantly reduced.6 However, it has also been argued that inadvertent nuclear war between the United States and Russia has continued to present a substantial risk.7 While the United States and Russia are not actively threatening each other with war, they have remained ready to launch nuclear missiles in response to indications of attack.8¶ False indicators of nuclear attack could be caused in several ways. First, a wide range of events have already been mistakenly interpreted as indicators of attack, including weather phenomena, a faulty computer chip, wild animal activity, and control-room training tapes loaded at the wrong time.9 Second, terrorist groups or other actors might cause attacks on either the United States or Russia that resemble some kind of nuclear attack by the other nation by actions such as exploding a stolen or improvised nuclear bomb,10 especially if such an event occurs during a crisis between the United States and Russia.11 A variety of nuclear terrorism scenarios are possible.12 Al Qaeda has sought to obtain or construct nuclear weapons and to use them against the United States.13 Other methods could involve attempts to circumvent nuclear weapon launch control safeguards or exploit holes in their security.14¶ It has long been argued that the probability of inadvertent nuclear war is significantly higher during U.S.-Russian crisis conditions,15 with the Cuban Missile Crisis being a prime historical example. It is possible that U.S.-Russian relations will significantly deteriorate in the future, increasing nuclear tensions. There are a variety of ways for a third party to raise tensions between the United States and Russia, making one or both nations more likely to misinterpret events as attacks.16</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HAlQaedawantsnuclearweapons." class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Al Qaeda wants nuclear weapons.</span></h4><p>Bunn et al. 11 (May 2011. &nbsp;Matthew Bunn, associate professor, at Harvard Kennedy School and Co- Principal Investigator of Project on Managing the Atom at Harvard’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs; Colonel Yuri Morozov, prof @ Russian Academy of Military Sciences former chief of General Staff of the Russian military; Rolf Mowatt-Larssen.

In a world that includes terrorists with global reach, effective nuclear security and accounting measures are needed wherever nuclear weapons, plutonium, or HEU exist. All countries with such stockpiles on their soil should ensure that they are at least protected against a modest group of well-armed, well-trained outsiders; a wellplaced insider; and both outsiders and an insider working together, using a broad range of tactics. Countries that face more substantial adversary threats—Pakistan being an obvious example—need to provide even higher levels of protection.9¶ Unfortunately, in many countries around the world, the security measures in place today are demonstrably not sufficient to protect against the kinds of threats terrorists and thieves have already shown they can pose. For example, a U.S. team visiting a foreign site with a Category I quantity of HEU from 2005 to 2010 found that there were no fences around the perimeter, no sensors to detect intrusions, no video surveillance systems to help guards assess the cause of alarms generated by sensors, and no vehicle barriers.10 (It is a reasonable bet that this facility also did not have an on-site armed response team to protect it from armed attackers.) The U.S. team recommended that all of these basic security measures be put in place, which the country agreed to do. But when a team of congressional auditors visited in 2010-11, some of the improvements were still under way. The fact that such glaring weaknesses still existed at a site with Category I materials years after the September 11, 2001 (9/11), attacks speaks volumes about the urgent work still ahead to plug nuclear security weak points around the world. Indeed, I would argue that every country with nuclear weapons or weapons-usable nuclear materials—including the United States—has more to do to ensure that these items are effectively protected.¶ PUNCTUATING COMPLACENT EQUILIBRIUM: THE U.S. CASE¶ If political turmoil is not the most important driver of nuclear security problems, what is? In a word, complacency—the belief that nuclear terrorism is not a serious threat, and that whatever security measures are in place today are already sufficient. The history of nuclear security is a story of punctuated equilibrium, with long stretches of complacency and little change punctuated by moments when something—typically, a major incident of some kind—made it possible to move the system to a higher-security state, from which it would then begin to drift slowly into complacency again. The results of incidents and other events are mediated by the different political cultures and institutions in different countries, so that one country might react to an incident by establishing substantial new security rules, while another might react by having participants in the system offer explanations why it could never happen again.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HScenario2isPakistan" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Scenario 2 is Pakistan</span></h4><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HTitle10shiftsolvesPakistaniblowback2013enableseffectivepublicrelations." class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Title 10 shift solves Pakistani blowback – enables effective public relations.</span></h4><p>Zenko 13 – (Apr. 2013, Micah, PhD, Douglas Dillon fellow in the Center for Preventive Action at the Council on Foreign Relations, formerly at the Harvard Kennedy School and the Brookings Institution, "POLICY INNOVATION MEMORANDUM NO. 31," Council on Foreign Relations, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.cfr.org/drones/transferring-cia-drone-strikes-pentagon/p30434)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.cfr.org/drones/transferring-cia-drone-strikes-pentagon/p30434)%27" tppabs="http://www.cfr.org/drones/transferring-cia-drone-strikes-pentagon/p30434)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.cfr.org/drones/transferring-cia-drone-strikes-pentagon/p30434)</span></a></span><br/>¶ The main objection to consolidating lead executive authority in DOD is that it would eliminate the possibility of deniability for U.S. covert operations. However, any diplomatic or public relations advantages from deniability that once existed are minimal or even nonexistent given the widely reported targeted killings in Pakistan and Yemen. For instance, because CIA drone strikes cannot be acknowledged, the United States has effectively ceded its strategic communications efforts to the Pakistani army and intelligence service, nongovernmental organizations, and the Taliban. Moreover, Pakistani and Yemeni militaries have often taken advantage of this communications vacuum by shifting the blame of civilian casualties caused by their own airstrikes (or others, like those reportedly conducted by Saudi Arabia in Yemen) to the U.S. government. This perpetuates and exacerbates animosity in civilian populations toward the United States. If the United States acknowledged its drone strikes and collateral damage—only possible under DOD Title 10 authorities—then it would not be held responsible for airstrikes conducted by other countries.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HSolvesPakistanioppositiontotheprogram." class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Solves Pakistani opposition to the program.</span></h4><p>Fair et al. 13 – (1/23, C.

But this course of action wouldn’t address most of the concerns about drones.¶ Taliban control would be far more disruptive to the daily lives of those living in the tribal region than drones are. Public meetings, unless authorized by the Taliban, would be rare and extremely dangerous. The Taliban’s shooting of a 14-year-old girl for attending school speaks volumes about access to education under Taliban rule. And the detention and execution of undesirable individuals would continue, albeit under the guise of heresy rather than spying. Also, ceding the territory to Taliban control would provide the Afghan Taliban with a safe haven from which to continue its operations against American and Afghan forces across the border.¶ The second option would be for Pakistan’s military to assert control over the region. However, its last serious attempt to do so — the Swat Valley campaign of 2009 — utilized armored vehicles, artillery and airstrikes to try to dislodge about 5,000 Taliban fighters. This resulted in the displacement of more than 1 million civilians who fled the army’s indiscriminate firepower.¶ Last year, mere rumors that the Pakistani military was planning a campaign in Waziristan caused thousands to flee. Pakistan lacks both the desire and the capacity to pursue another campaign to gain control of the tribal areas, and any attempt to conduct such a campaign would be a humanitarian nightmare for the civilians who live there.¶ The third option would be for the United States to use ground troops and special forces to conduct counterinsurgency operations in the tribal areas. Even if Pakistan were willing to publicly consent to American ground forces on its territory, an issue that it has carefully finessed in the context of drone operations, it is unlikely that this option would alleviate any of the frequently voiced concerns about the use of drones.¶ If operations in Afghanistan are any guide, using ground troops would result in as many or more civilian casualties than the current drone campaign and would be more deeply unpopular in Pakistan — not to mention that it would result in higher U.S. casualties. Ground operations in territory controlled by the Taliban would still rely heavily on drone surveillance, and most raids would occur at night.¶ Such operations in Afghanistan were so unpopular and disruptive of daily life that President Hamid Karzai insisted that continued Afghan cooperation with the United States was contingent on Afghan control over night raids.¶ The final option is the continued use of drones. Even according to the least favorable numbers presented by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, drones have effectively disrupted the leadership structure of the Taliban and Al Qaeda in Pakistan by killing scores of senior leaders and operational commanders. And the drones’ constant presence continues to deny the Taliban a safe haven in which it can train and organize its forces for operations in Afghanistan. Most important, drones have done this while consistently improving their accuracy and reducing civilian casualties.¶ After examining the alternatives, it is clear that drones remain the best option available to minimize the negative effects of the conflict on civilians while continuing to disrupt the Taliban and deny it control of territory in the tribal areas.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HPakistaniinstabilityescalatestonuclearwar." class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Pakistani instability escalates to nuclear war.</span></h4><p>Pitt 09 – a New York Times and internationally bestselling author of two books: "War on Iraq: What Team Bush Doesn’t Want You to Know" and "The Greatest Sedition Is Silence."

Insurgencies and terrorist organizations dominate the media and U.S. security concerns driving national policy and U.S. troop deployments. One problem state that is demanding more U.S. policy and military attention is Pakistan. Since Pakistan’s partition from India in 1947, the state has remained rife with instability. During these six decades, Pakistan has endured the death and assassination of key leaders, weak governmental institutions, four military coups, the emergence of radical Islam, civil war, and conventional conflicts with India. Today, terrorism, insurgency, and the state’s possession of nuclear weapons reinforce the significance of ensuring Pakistan’s long-term stability. Yet, it remains unclear whetherthese events and characteristics will eventually lead to state failure in Pakistan. As a result, a pressing need exists to identify and examine the primary sources of instability in Pakistan. Therefore, an analysis of domestic, regional, and international events in Pakistan may uncover critical evidence that impliesthat the state’s future is daunting. ¶ Essentially, Pakistan’s instability is a result of the combined effects of domestic, regional, and international hardships that have affected the state’s political stability, economic performance, and security. These unrelenting problems lie at the foundation of a state whose welfare is directly linked to U.S. interests in the region. Unfortunately, much of the evidence suggests that Pakistan is currently a fragile state, exhibiting the political, economic, and social indicators that place the state on the brink of failure.¶ Perhaps the illusion of a democratic government, coupled with a strong security apparatus found in the Pakistani Army keep U.S. concerns at a manageable level. In reality, however, these characteristics merely create a façade that hides a threat that is perhaps more dangerous than any we currently face. Therefore, this study attempts to highlight and explain many of Pakistan’s problems under the framework of assessing the likelihood of state failure. Until there is a shared understanding of Pakistan’sturbulent history, and a clear image of the state’s enduring problems emerges, the future of Pakistan may remain a mystery.¶ Methodology¶ State failure is a legitimate threat to both global and regional stability. As such, Pakistan’s geo-political situation creates a unique challenge in that this unstable state is a vital link between Central and South Asia. Given its regional importance and the state’s historical and current problems, this monograph seeks to determine the likelihood of state failure in Pakistan. This task requires a detailed analysis of Pakistan in the years prior to partition through the state’s current or ongoing troubles. From this, a single-country case study methodology provides the best "contextual description" of the state and may be useful in explaining specific causal mechanisms of instability in Pakistan. 1 Specifically, an overview of the existing literature on the characteristics of state failure, a historical description of the various hardships – domestic, regional, and international - encountered by Pakistan, and an analysis of several key drivers of the state’s instability will help the author build a plausible argument that leads to only one conclusion: that Pakistan is on the brink of failure. Yet, if state failure is in fact a likely scenario in Pakistan’s future, this phenomenon would certainly create additional problems that extend well beyond the state’s borders. Most importantly, the success of ongoing military operations in Afghanistan relies heavily on stability in Pakistan leaving the U.S. military the immediate recipient of the negative consequences associated with state failure.¶ The initial step in developing the structure for this investigation involves an overview of past scholarly research on state failure. This review will provide a theoretical foundation to frame the subsequent analysis of Pakistan as a fragile orfailing state. Numerous definitions of state failure exist, including varying levels of failure such as weak, fragile, and collapsed states. In addition, examining the indicators of failure as well as the criteria and methods for measuring failure will help to explain why some states fail while others may only possess the possibility of failure. Various resources, including numerous books, professional journals, and other electronic or web-based resources add to the body of literature concerning failed states. Ultimately, this literature review will provide the essential basis for comparison when attempting to determine whether Pakistan is merely weak, in transition, or on the brink of state failure.¶ Although the state is barely sixty-two years old, Pakistan’s short history provides ample evidence that suggests a potentially bleak outlook. In order to solidify this claim, a description of Pakistan’s turbulent history may reveal why this adolescent state is "one of the least stable polities in the world."2 The section entitled "A History of Instability: Pakistan’s Troubled Past," provides a detailed description of various domestic, regional, and international events that set the conditions for instability in the state. Specifically, this historical analysis will describe Pakistan’s partition with India and this event’s associated problems, the state’s difficulty with drafting and maintaining a constitution, Pakistan’s ongoing conflict with India over control of the Kashmir region, and finally the consequences of foreign state influence focusing primarily on the significance of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 and the advent of Islamic extremism under President Zia ul-Haq.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HThere2019snosubstantivedifferencebetweenCIAandDODcontrol"

They had an arsenal of unmanned drones capable of scouring the earth to watch the enemy – and, yes, they could be armed. Back then, the Air Force didn’t want them, but the C.I.A. did. And they were ready.¶ The C.I.A. was designed to focus on figuring out what needs to be done, how it could be done and what the consequences would be.¶ The C.I.A. had a directorate of case officers whose personality and training made them experts in getting information from reticent people. They had been taught to use the art of persuasion, not coercion, but if the president wanted sticks rather than carrots, they could and would adapt.¶ Uniquely, the C.I.A. had a network of officers in place, worldwide, ready to do what was needed – and they were quick learners. The C.I.A. has always been willing and able to morph into whatever the policymakers of the time want it to be. It is a flexible, can-do cadre of officers, selected and trained to think outside the box, assess a problem and solve it.¶ But by asking the C.I.A. to do all of these things, something else has to give. No matter how many resources you throw at it, the agency cannot maintain its core mission if its focus is diverted in too many directions.¶ Since its creation, the C.I.A. has given policymakers its best estimate of the plans, intentions and capabilities of foreign nations and entities that seek to do us harm. To do that, its officers recruit human assets, develop innovative technology and apply expert analysis to the fruits of the collection.¶ Thus, the C.I.A.’s core mission was to assess and predict. We designed the agency to focus on figuring out what needs to be done, whether and how it could be done and, most important, what the consequences of those actions would likely be.¶ The focus of the men and women of the C.I.A. – indeed, the entire culture of the agency – has been hijacked for purposes that are contrary to its original mission. It does not take an intelligence expert to imagine the vast amount of human and technical resources it has taken to identify and locate 2,500 people that were found to have met the standards to justify killing them, according to a recent Times article, and to conduct operations to do so.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HCIAintelligenceiskeytoAmericanmilitarypower2013solveseveryimpact" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>CIA intelligence is key to American military power – solves every impact</span></h4><p>Tenet 97 – (George, former CIA director, DCI Remarks: Does America Need the CIA?

Zegart is co-director of the Center for International Security and Cooperation, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, and professor of political economy at Stanford’s Graduate School of Business</p><p>3. There’s a reason the CIA has the word "Central" in its name. It was created in 1947 to integrate all the disparate pieces of intelligence floating around military intelligence agencies, the State Dept. and the Justice Dept. In 1941, clues to the Japanese attack at Pearl Harbor were scattered throughout the U.S. government, but no one agency had the job of putting them together. That became CIA’s mission. It may not have performed that mission well, but it’s the best we’ve got. 4. CIA is also the lead agency for human intelligence collection. And let’s face it, human intelligence is more important than ever. In the Cold War, most good intelligence involved counting things like Soviet missiles. Today, good intelligence requires getting inside our enemies’ heads. It doesn’t help much to know how many box cutters or truck bombs al Qaeda owns. President Obama seems to get what Yglesias does not: he needs the CIA now more than ever. He’s got the fullest plate in modern history, with two wars, one whopper economic crisis, terrorists, nuclear proliferators, and failing states. Intelligence does not predict the future, but it bounds the uncertainty of it to help the president make better decisions. Sometimes the CIA is tragically wrong. Sometimes it’s ugly. But make no mistake: the CIA is vital to protecting American lives and interests.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HIntelcapabilitycrucialtoresolvingmultipleconflicts" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Intel capability crucial to resolving multiple conflicts</span></h4><p>Vickers 13<br/>STATEMENT OF DR.

He does not recognize, first, the impact of the distribution of power and, second and related, the value of US power. The impact of the system on violence is significant (Waltz 1979). Including changes in the distribution of power and alliance problems that contributed to World Wars I and II, the bipolarity of the Cold War, and most importantly, the rise of China, Pinker largely misses the influence of the system in promoting and, after World War II, suppressing violence.¶ Accordingly, while Pinker is sensitive to the importance of power in a domestic context—the Leviathan is good for safety and the decline of violence—he neglects the role of power in the international context, specifically he neglects US power as a force for stability. So, if a liberal Leviathan is good for domestic politics, a liberal Leviathan should be as well for international politics. The primacy of the United States provides the world with that liberal Leviathan and has four major positive consequences for international politics (Thayer 2006).¶ In addition to ensuring the security of the United States and its allies, American primacy within the international system causes many positive outcomes for the world. The first has been a more peaceful world. During the Cold War, US leadership reduced friction among many states that were historical antagonists, most notably France and West Germany. Today, American primacy and the security blanket it provides reduce nuclear proliferation incentives and help keep a number of complicated relationships stable such as between Greece and Turkey, Israel and Egypt, South Korea and Japan, India and Pakistan, Indonesia and Australia. Wars still occur where Washington’s interests are not seriously threatened, such as in Darfur, but a Pax Americana does reduce war’s likelihood—particularly the worst form—great power wars.¶ Second, American power gives the United States the ability to spread democracy and many of the other positive forces Pinker identifies. Doing so is a source of much good for the countries concerned as well as the United States because liberal democracies are more likely to align with the United States and be sympathetic to the American worldview. In addition, once states are governed democratically, the likelihood of any type of conflict is significantly reduced. This is not because democracies do not have clashing interests. Rather, it is because they are more transparent, more likely to want to resolve things amicably in concurrence with US leadership.¶ Third, along with the growth of the number of democratic states around the world has been the growth of the global economy. With its allies, the United States has labored to create an economically liberal worldwide network characterized by free trade and commerce, respect for international property rights, mobility of capital, and labor markets. The economic stability and prosperity that stems from this economic order is a global public good.¶ Fourth, and finally, the United States has been willing to use its power not only to advance its interests but to also promote the welfare of people all over the globe. The United States is the earth’s leading source of positive externalities for the world. The US military has participated in over 50 operations since the end of the Cold War—and most of those missions have been humanitarian in nature. Indeed, the US military is the earth’s "911 force"—it serves, de facto, as the world’s police, the global paramedic, and the planet’s fire department.¶ There is no other state, group of states, or international organizations that can provide these global benefits. Without US power, the liberal order created by the United States will end just as assuredly. But, the waning of US power, at least in relative terms, introduces additional problems for Pinker concerning the decline of violence in the international realm. Given the importance of the distribution of power in international politics, and specifically US power for stability, there is reason to be concerned about the future as the distribution of relative power changes and not to the benefit of the United States.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HEngagementiscomparativelythebeststrategy2013criticsignorenon-militarybenefitsandexcluderelevantdata." class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Engagement is comparatively the best strategy – critics ignore non-military benefits and exclude relevant data.</span></h4><p>Brooks et al. 13 – (2013, Stephen, Associate Professor of Government at Dartmouth College, G.

The U.S. military conducts similar strikes, usually through Joint Special Operations Command, including in Yemen and Somalia. Many argue that these strikes are illegal or counterproductive — regardless of who conducts them — because they deny targeted suspects legal process, violate national sovereignty, cause collateral damage, and fuel radicalism. Others believe, however, that these problems are compounded when the CIA is in charge because of the secrecy and impunity with which it operates.¶ In truth, critics often underestimate oversight of CIA activities and overestimate the openness of military operations. Even if the Pentagon conducts all U.S. drone strikes, the operational details will still be shrouded in secrecy, the CIA will still provide targeting information, and much of the congressional oversight will still be conducted behind closed doors (though it will shift from the intelligence committees to the armed services committees). The CIA is also subject to some statutory congressional reporting requirements that the Defense Department is not. That said, moving all strikes under Defense Department control and eliminating their officially covert status will probably allow executive branch officials and members of Congress to speak more clearly and openly about general policy in this area.¶ With regard to the legal rules that govern targeting, it may be that shifting operations to the Defense Department will promote stricter compliance. In a 2012 speech, the CIA general counsel stated that the agency conducts its operations "in a manner consistent with the...basic principles in the law of armed conflict" — not that the CIA is legally required to comply with the rules — which led many to wonder whether the agency was operating outside their bounds. The military is also much better practiced than the CIA in applying the law of armed conflict and assessing collateral damage. Even if the CIA has in reality been fully compliant, it is in the U.S. interest to promote these international legal rules by communicating unambiguously and demonstrating its own normative commitment to them.
