Geopolitical Strategic Considerations Bearing on Judicial Interpretation<br/>Before the United States Supreme Court Justices form an opinion on the legality of national security decisions by the POTUS, they should immerse themselves in judicially-noticeable facts concerning what national security expert, Bruce Berkowitz, in the subtitle of his recent book, calls the "challengers, competitors, and threats to America's future." n23 Not that the Justices need to become experts in national security affairs, n24 but every Supreme Court Justice should be aware of the following five basic national security facts and conceptions before sitting in judgment on presiprudential national security determinations.<br/>(1) "National security policy . . . is … themselves with regional powers." n27<br/>(2) "Yet, as worrisome as these immediate concerns may be, the long-term challenges are even harder to deal with, and the stakes are higher. Whereas the main Cold War threat--the Soviet Union--was brittle, most of the potential adversaries and challengers America now faces are resilient." n28<br/>(3) "The most important task … advantage, they do not." n30<br/>(4) While "keeping the strategic advantage may not have the idealistic ring of making the world safe for democracy and does not sound as decisively macho as maintaining American hegemony," n31 maintaining the American "strategic advantage is critical, because it is essential for just about everything else America hopes to achieve--promoting freedom, protecting the homeland, defending its values, preserving peace, and so on." n32<br/>(5) The United States requires … focus its own resources." n34<br/>&nbsp;*888 &nbsp;As further serious preparation for engaging in the jurisprudence of American national security presiprudence in hotly contested cases and controversies that may end up on their docket, our Supreme Court Justices should understand that, as Walter Russell Mead pointed out in an important essay a few years ago, n35 the average American can be understood as a Jacksonian pragmatist on national security issues. n36 "Americans are determined to keep the world at a distance, while not isolating ourselves from it completely. If we need to take action abroad, we want to do it on our terms." n37 Thus, recent social science survey data paints "a picture of a country whose practical people take a practical approach to knowledge about national security. Americans do not bother with the details most of the time because, for most Americans, the details do not matter most the time." n38 Indeed, since the American people "do know the outlines of the big picture and what we need to worry about in national security affairs so we know when we need to pay greater attention and what is at stake. This is the kind of knowledge suited to a Jacksonian." n39<br/>Turning to how the Supreme … his national security executive subordinates.</p><p>6<br/>Ex ante review devastates targeted killing – ex ante review makes strikes ineffective and causes broad rulings that eliminate the program<br/>Groves 13 (Steven, Bernard and Barbara Lomas Senior Research Fellow in the Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom, a division of the Kathryn and Shelby Cullom Davis Institute for International Studies, at The Heritage Foundation.¶ , "Drone Strikes: The Legality of US Targeting Terrorists Abroad," Heritage Foundation, April 10, www.heritage.org/research/reports/2013/04/drone-strikes-the-legality-of-us-targeting-terrorists-abroad)<br/>The proponents of a drone court … established to oversee targeting decisions.</p><p>Geographic limits on terrorist strikes make CT ineffective – create safe havens<br/>Corn 13<br/>Geoffrey Corn, Professor of Law and Presidential Research Professor, South Texas College of Law, 3/15/13, Statement before the Senate Armed Services Committee, CQ Research Service<br/>3.

Geopolitical Strategic Considerations Bearing on Judicial Interpretation<br/>Before the United States Supreme Court Justices form an opinion on the legality of national security decisions by the POTUS, they should immerse themselves in judicially-noticeable facts concerning what national security expert, Bruce Berkowitz, in the subtitle of his recent book, calls the "challengers, competitors, and threats to America's future." n23 Not that the Justices need to become experts in national security affairs, n24 but every Supreme Court Justice should be aware of the following five basic national security facts and conceptions before sitting in judgment on presiprudential national security determinations.<br/>(1) "National security policy . . . is … themselves with regional powers." n27<br/>(2) "Yet, as worrisome as these immediate concerns may be, the long-term challenges are even harder to deal with, and the stakes are higher. Whereas the main Cold War threat--the Soviet Union--was brittle, most of the potential adversaries and challengers America now faces are resilient." n28<br/>(3) "The most important task … advantage, they do not." n30<br/>(4) While "keeping the strategic advantage may not have the idealistic ring of making the world safe for democracy and does not sound as decisively macho as maintaining American hegemony," n31 maintaining the American "strategic advantage is critical, because it is essential for just about everything else America hopes to achieve--promoting freedom, protecting the homeland, defending its values, preserving peace, and so on." n32<br/>(5) The United States requires … focus its own resources." n34<br/>&nbsp;*888 &nbsp;As further serious preparation for engaging in the jurisprudence of American national security presiprudence in hotly contested cases and controversies that may end up on their docket, our Supreme Court Justices should understand that, as Walter Russell Mead pointed out in an important essay a few years ago, n35 the average American can be understood as a Jacksonian pragmatist on national security issues. n36 "Americans are determined to keep the world at a distance, while not isolating ourselves from it completely. If we need to take action abroad, we want to do it on our terms." n37 Thus, recent social science survey data paints "a picture of a country whose practical people take a practical approach to knowledge about national security. Americans do not bother with the details most of the time because, for most Americans, the details do not matter most the time." n38 Indeed, since the American people "do know the outlines of the big picture and what we need to worry about in national security affairs so we know when we need to pay greater attention and what is at stake. This is the kind of knowledge suited to a Jacksonian." n39<br/>Turning to how the Supreme … his national security executive subordinates.</p><p>American decline destroys the economic order and global institutions <br/>Kagan 12 (Robert Kagan, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, “Why the World Needs America,” 2/11/12) <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203646004577213262856669448.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203646004577213262856669448.html#printMode%27" tppabs="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203646004577213262856669448.html#printMode"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203646004577213262856669448.html#printMode</span></a></span><br/>Foreign-policy pundits increasingly argue … both it and themselves alive.</p><p>7<br/>International climate agreement and domestic … is judicially enforced climate action<br/>Borden 10-1 (Theresa, "A glboal solution to climate change: the possible impact of Bond v.

Why non-nuclear states are not deterred from fighting nuclear states is an important and open question. But in a time when calls to ban the Bomb are being heard from more and more quarters, we must be clear about precisely what the broad trends toward peace can and cannot tell us.

Military Leadership And Decisionmaking Would Suffer War is the province of chance. “If we now consider briefly the subjective nature of war—the means by which war has to be fought—it will look more than ever like a gamble . . . in the whole range of human activities, war most closely resembles a game of cards.” Clausewitz, 86-87. Within this field of human endeavor, the most successful armies are those led by decisive commanders who visualize the operational environment and make rapid, sound decisions. Combat leadership involves the motivation of others to risk their lives, and only the most decisive and confident leaders can inspire this kind of self-sacrifice. Leadership is the multiplying and unifying element of combat power. Confident, competent, and informed leadership intensifies the effectiveness of all other elements of combat power by formulating sound operational ideas and assuring discipline and motivation in the force . . . Leadership in today’s operational environment is often the difference between success and failure. Dept. of the Army, Field Manual 3-0, Operations, at ¶¶ 4-6 - 4-8 (2008), available at <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.army.mil/fm3-0/fm3-0.pdf.  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.army.mil/fm3-0/fm3-0.pdf.%27" tppabs="http://www.army.mil/fm3-0/fm3-0.pdf."><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.army.mil/fm3-0/fm3-0.pdf.</span></a></span> Battle command is a subset of combat leadership—it is how wartime leaders operationalize their intent and transmit their guidance to subordinate units. Battle command is the art and science of understanding, visualizing, describing, directing, leading, and assessing forces to impose the commander’s will on a hostile, thinking, and adaptive enemy. Battle command applies leadership to translate decisions into actions—by synchronizing forces and warfighting functions in time, space, and purpose—to accomplish missions. Battle command is guided by professional judgment gained from experience, knowledge, education, intelligence, and intuition. It is driven by commanders. Id. at ¶ 5-9. Battlefield decisionmaking involves the visualization of the battlefield and all its components, the deliberate assessment of operational risk, and the selection of a course of action which accepts certain risks in order to achieve tactical, operational or strategic success. Id. at ¶ 5-10; see also Gen. Frederick M. Franks, Jr., Battle Command: A Commander’s Perspective, Military Review, May-June 1996, at 120-121. “Given the inherently uncertain nature of war, the object of planning is not to eliminate or minimize uncertainty but to foster decisive and effective action in the midst of such uncertainty.” Army Field Manual 3-07, Stability Operations, at ¶ 4-4 (2008), available at <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://usacac.army.mil/cac2/repository/FM307/FM307.pdf.  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://usacac.army.mil/cac2/repository/FM307/FM307.pdf.%27" tppabs="http://usacac.army.mil/cac2/repository/FM307/FM307.pdf."><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://usacac.army.mil/cac2/repository/FM307/FM307.pdf.</span></a></span> In bringing this case, Plaintiff asks this Court to substitute itself as the battlefield commander, and to second-guess the strategic, operational and tactical decisions made by this nation’s military chain of command in the campaign against Al Qaeda. Judicial decisionmaking is incompatible with military decisionmaking. Rather than produce rapid, confident, decisive actions, judicial resolution of this matter would produce deliberate and measured decisions which are the product of adversarial process, and which would reflect judicial considerations, not strategic or tactical ones. Also, judicial involvement may induce risk aversion among commanders, who would worry about how their actions might be judged in courtrooms far removed from the battlefield, and thus hedge their battlefield decisions in order to protect themselves and their units from future judicial scrutiny. This is particularly true of Plaintiff’s prayer for relief, which calls upon the Court to enjoin the Government from using lethal force “except in circumstances in which they present concrete, specific, and imminent threats to life or physical safety, and there are no means other than lethal force that could reasonably be employed to neutralize the threats.” Such decisions about the use of force can often be made by soldiers in a split-second, on the basis of intuition and training. The specter of judicial involvement will affect the way soldiers and leaders approach these decisions, potentially complicating and slowing their decisions by injecting judicial considerations which have no place on the battlefield.</p><p>Impact is nuclear war<br/>Knowles 9 – Acting Assistant Professor, New York University School of Law (Robert, Spring, “American Hegemony and the Foreign Affairs Constitution”, 41 Ariz.

Nevertheless, there are a number of known examples where drones appear to have made a significant difference in helping the Yemeni government cope with AQAP while reducing that organization’s ability to conduct international terrorism. <br/>Two of these instances are especially compelling and deserve special consideration. They are:<br/>(1) the September 2011 death of terrorist leader Anwar al Awlaki, and <br/>(2) the use of drones to support Yemen’s May-June 2012 offensive against AQAP insurgents and members of the AQAP insurgent organization, Ansar al Shariah, which by early 2012 had seized power in a number of southern Yemeni towns and cities. 6<br/>The death of Awlaki in a drone strike is especially informative when considering the value of these systems.7 Despite Awlaki’s US citizenship, President Obama was reported by Newsweek to have considered him a higher priority for capture or elimination than Ayman al Zawahiri, bin Laden’s replacement as the leader of “al Qaeda central.”8 Federal prosecutors, in a case involving an alleged Awlaki associate, maintain that he was the mastermind behind a variety of terrorist activities including the 2009 “Christmas bomber” plot. 9 In this effort, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, a terrorist operative and Awlaki “student” attempted to demolish a Detroit-bound passenger jet that left Amsterdam with 280 people aboard. This plan failed, and Abdulmutallab was badly burned when a bomb sewn into his underwear did not detonate properly. He was then restrained by airline personnel and arrested when the aircraft landed.10 This unsuccessful plot appears to have had the diabolical purpose of provoking US leadership to invade Yemen in response to these innocent deaths. Such an intervention with ground troops could have produced catastrophic results. Yemen is a highly nationalistic country of 24 million people and 60 million firearms. Any intervention there could last for years and expand rather than diminish the ranks of AQAP. This disaster was well worth avoiding on both foreign policy and humanitarian grounds.&nbsp;</p><p>Drone strikes take out aqap<br/>Emker 13 – (1/14, Stacey, senior editor, Journal … helped in avoiding catastrophic mistakes.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>1NR</p><p>Structural factors mean the transatlantic partnership will inevitably fall – and that’s ok – the plan can’t change this<br/>Walt 11 (Stephen M.

But the reality today is that the technology will transform civil aviation, in many of the same ways and for the same reasons that another robotic technology, driverless cars (which Google is busily plying up and down the streets of San Francisco, but which started as a DARPA project). UAVs will eventually move into many roles in ordinary aviation, because it is cheaper, relatively safer, more reliable – and it will eventually include cargo planes, crop dusting, border patrol, forest fire patrols, and many other tasks. There is a reason for this – the avionics involved are simply not so complicated as to be beyond the abilities of many, many states. Military applications will carry drones many different directions, from next-generation unmanned fighter aircraft able to operate against other craft at much higher G stresses to tiny surveillance drones. But the flying-around technology for aircraft that are generally sizes flown today is not that difficult, and any substantial state that feels like developing them will be able to do so.<br/>But the point is that … that are … more discriminating.<br/>The real place where states divide in their technological abilities with respect to drones is not about avionics or weapons – but the third, crucial conceptual element of a drone: sensor capabilities. Those are capabilities in both hardware, the kinds of signals that can be taken in from the real world (video, radar, infrared, etc.), and software, the kinds of analytic integration that can be achieved, coupled with other streams from outside the drone, such as general telecomm monitoring. That is an area in which the US has a significant edge – the Chinese, Russians, India, or for that matter, Germany or France, could do it if desired, though everyone will find it easier to steal it and reverse engineer.<br/>Worth noting, as well, something that is rarely noted: today’s sensor technologies work well over deserts and largely bare mountains. They have not been developed for seeing through forest or jungle cover. Moreover, none of this takes account of a central reason why the US is successful with drones in Pakistan – the investment over years in an on-the-ground intelligence network that permits targeting in the first place: the focus on drones as technology in the Shane piece doesn’t not pay enough attention to this crucial, non-technological element. &nbsp;The recent Reuters piece on the ground-level intelligence piece makes it clear that purely focusing on the technology gives a profoundly misleading picture of drones and their capabilities.<br/>But again, let’s ask, why … who want it are limited.<br/>The real arms race in drones will take place, not around drones themselves, but in counters to drones. Drones are effective, in their current form, against non-state actors, terrorists, low tech insurgents, because they have no air-defense systems. The game changer in Afghanistan against Soviet helicopters was American-supplied Stinger missiles. When some state designs and starts handing out some form of air-defense system to non-state actors, then the arms race in drones actually begins. It begins with re-designs of slow, noisy surveillance craft designed to operate at high altitude over long periods of time. It takes into account one of the most likely forms of counter to drones – viruses or other malware that interferes with the communications links that control the drones – shades of the malware discovered in drone systems recently.<br/>It is indeed likely that … too vulnerable today), surprising to me.</p><p>Other countries will just cheat…come on now<br/>Lerner ‘13<br/>BEN LERNER, 3.25.13, American Spectator, “Judging ‘Drones’ From Afar,” <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://spectator.org/archives/2013/03/25/judging-drones-from-afar  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://spectator.org/archives/2013/03/25/judging-drones-from-afar%27" tppabs="http://spectator.org/archives/2013/03/25/judging-drones-from-afar"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://spectator.org/archives/2013/03/25/judging-drones-from-afar</span></a></span><br/>Whatever the potential motivations for … how this often plays out.</p><p>The norms don’t work- they’re unenforceable and don’t <br/>Lerner ‘13<br/>BEN LERNER, 3.25.13, American Spectator, “Judging ‘Drones’ From Afar,” <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://spectator.org/archives/2013/03/25/judging-drones-from-afar  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://spectator.org/archives/2013/03/25/judging-drones-from-afar%27" tppabs="http://spectator.org/archives/2013/03/25/judging-drones-from-afar"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://spectator.org/archives/2013/03/25/judging-drones-from-afar</span></a></span><br/>And who would enforce the … others to dictate its outcome.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>The US model is fine now <br/>Anderson 13 – (5/24, Kenneth, Professor of Law, Washington College of Law, American University Member, Task Force on National Security and Law, The Hoover Institution, Stanford University, “The Case for Drones,” Real Clear Politics)</p><p>This critique often leads, however, … be responsible.

As horrifying as the Mumbai attacks were, they are not likely to drive India and Pakistan into an armed international conflict. The media frenzy over an imminent nuclear war seems the result of the media being superficially knowledgeable about the history of Indian-Pakistani relations, of feeling compelled to follow the most sensationalistic story, and being recently brainwashed into thinking that the only way to respond to a major terrorist attack was the American way – a war.<br/>Here are four reasons why the Mumbai attacks will not result in a war:</p><ol><li>For both countries, a war … militant Islamic outfits have not.<br/>Groups based in the tribal regions bordering Afghanistan have orchestrated frequent deadly suicide bombings and clashes with the Pakistani military, including the attack that killed ex-Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in 2007. The battle that the Pakistani government faces now is not against its traditional enemy India, but against militants bent on destroying the Pakistani state and creating a Taliban-style regime in Pakistan. In order to deal with this threat, it must strengthen the structures of a democratic, inclusive political system that can also address domestic problems and inequalities. On the other hand, the threat of Pakistani based terrorists to India is significant. However, suicide bombings and attacks are also carried out by Indian Islamic militants, and vast swaths of rural India are under the de facto control of the Maoist guerrillas known as the Naxalites. Hindu fundamentalists pose a serious threat to the safety of many Muslim and Christian Indians and to the idea of India as a diverse, secular, democratic society. Separatist insurgencies in Kashmir and in parts of the northeast have dragged on for years. And like Pakistan, India faces significant challenges in addressing sharp social and economic inequalities.

Perhaps we hope that they will convey urgency and seriousness of purpose. But what we too rarely account for is that black people (in particular) are not seen as human – therefore the urgency that we seek is by definition unattainable. The state will not be rushing in any time soon to provide needed resources. Public Enemy illustrated this brilliantly years ago with their song “911 is a joke.” Black lives are unfortunately seen as disposable.

The Dangers of judicial Intervention Faced with the prospect that congressional participation can sometimes play a salutary role in avoiding unnecessary wars, an antecedent question naturally arises. Should the courts decide if such a congressional role would be appropriate? Indeed, a recurring theme running through much of the Congress-first literature is that judicial intervention is necessary to vindicate the congressional role in initiating conflicts. But if one accepts the signaling model developed here, there are significant reasons why one ought to be wary of a judicial role in resolving war powers controversies. First, under our model of international crisis bargaining, judicial review would likely undermine the value of signals sent by the President when he seeks legislative authorization to go to war. In other words, it is the fact that the signal is both costly and discretionary that often makes it valuable. Once one understands that regime characteristics can influence the informational value of signaling, it makes sense that the President should have the maximum flexibility to choose less costly signals when dealing with rogue states or terrorist organizations. The alternative- a judicial rule that mandates costly signals in all circumstances, even when such signals have little or no informational value to the foreign adversary-would dilute the overall value of such signals. Second, judicial review would preclude the possibility of beneficial bargaining between the President and Congress by forcing warmaking into a procedural straitjacket. In this picture, judicial review would constrain the political branches to adopt only the tying hands type of signal regardless of the nature or stage of an international crisis. But the supposed restraining effect attributed to the tying hands signal can vary considerably depending on whether the democracy is deciding to initiate an international crisis or is already in the midst of an escalating crisis. Requiring legislative authorization may make it less likely that the democracy will be willing to back out of a conflict once it starts. Thus, tying hand signals and judicial insistence that the President seek legislative authorization will contribute to greater international instability once a conflict has already started.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>1nc 4<br/>Obama is shifting from drones to detention<br/>Dillow 13 (Clay, “Obama Set To Reboot Drone Strike Policy And Retool The War On Terror “, 5/23/13, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2013-05/obama-set-reboot-drone-strike-policy-and-retool-war-terror)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2013-05/obama-set-reboot-drone-strike-policy-and-retool-war-terror)%27" tppabs="http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2013-05/obama-set-reboot-drone-strike-policy-and-retool-war-terror)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2013-05/obama-set-reboot-drone-strike-policy-and-retool-war-terror)</span></a></span></p><p>These three topics are deeply … unseen robots in the sky.&nbsp;</p><p>Restricted detention leads to increased drone use<br/>Chesney 11 (Robert, Charles I.

More seriously, they ¶ neglect basic and fundamental principles of American constitutional law, and they assume ¶ incorrectly that the traditional processes have proven ineffective. The idea that there is a class ¶ of individuals for whom neither the normal civilian or military criminal justice systems suffice ¶ presupposes that such a class of individuals is readily identifiable—and in a manner that does ¶ not necessarily pre-judge their guilt. The idea that national security courts are a proper third ¶ way for dealing with such individuals presupposes that the purported defects in the current ¶ system are ones that cannot adequately be remedied within the confines of that system, and ¶ yet can be remedied in new tribunals without violating the Constitution. ¶ We believe that the government can accomplish its legitimate goals using existing laws and ¶ legal procedures without resorting to such sweeping and radical departures from an American ¶ constitutional tradition that has served us effectively for over two centuries. We separately ¶ address below proposals for a national security court for criminal prosecutions of terrorism ¶ suspects and proposals for such a court to review preventive detention decisions, and the ¶ reasons why each should be rejected¶ II. CRIMINAL TRIALS FOR TERRORISM SUSPECTS¶ Advocates of national security courts that would try terrorism suspects claim that traditional ¶ Article III courts are unequipped to handle these cases. This claim has not been substantiated, ¶ and is made in the face of a significant — and growing — body of evidence to the contrary. A ¶ recent report released by Human Rights First persuasively demonstrates that our existing ¶ federal courts are competent to try these cases. The report examines more than 120 ¶ international terrorism cases brought in the federal courts over the past fifteen years. It finds ¶ that established federal courts were able to try these cases without sacrificing either national ¶ security or the defendants’ rights to a fair trial.3¶ The report documents how federal courts have ¶ successfully dealt with classified evidence under the Classified Information Procedures Act ¶ (CIPA) without creating any security breaches. It further concludes that courts have been able ¶ to enforce the government’s Brady obligations to share exculpatory evidence with the accused, ¶ deal with Miranda warning issues, and provide means for the government to establish a chain ¶ of custody for physical evidence, all without jeopardizing national security. ¶ Of course, our traditional federal courts have not always done everything that the government ¶ would like them to do. They are, after all, constrained by well-established constitutional limits ¶ on prosecutorial power. For example, no federal court would permit the prosecution to present ¶ witnesses without protecting the defendant’s constitutional right to confront those witnesses ¶ against him or her.4¶ Nor would a federal court permit the prosecution to rely on a coerced ¶ confession in violation of a defendant’s Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. But ¶ creating a new set of courts would not repeal existing constitutional rights. Conversely, to the ¶ extent that the existing rules are not constitutionally compelled, ordinary federal courts (or ¶ Congress, where applicable) can modify them when it is shown that the modification is ¶ necessary to accommodate the government’s legitimate interests. ¶ Most importantly, there is the intrinsic and inescapable problem of definition. Whereas the ¶ argument for specialized courts for tax and patent law is that expert judges are particularly ¶ necessary given the complex subject-matter, proposals for specialized courts for terrorism trials ¶ are based on the asserted need for relaxed procedural and evidentiary rules and are justified on ¶ the ground that terrorists do not deserve full constitutional protections.5¶ This creates two ¶ fundamental constitutional problems. First, justifying departures from constitutional protections ¶ on the basis that the trials are for terrorists undermines the presumption of innocence for these ¶ individuals. Second, if a conviction were obtained in a national security court using procedural ¶ and evidentiary rules that imposed a lesser burden on the government, then the defendant would be subjected to trial before a national security court based upon less of a showing than ¶ would be required in a traditional criminal proceeding. The result would be to apply less due ¶ process to the question of guilt or innocence, which, by definition, would increase the risk of ¶ error. And, if the government must make a preliminary showing that meets traditional rules of ¶ procedure and evidence in order to trigger the jurisdiction of a national security court, such a ¶ showing would also enable it to proceed via the traditional criminal process. ¶ National security courts for criminal prosecutions are not just unnecessary; they are also ¶ dangerous. They run the risk of creating a separate and unequal criminal justice system for a ¶ particular class of suspects,6¶ who will be brought before such specialized courts based on the ¶ very allegations they are contesting. Such a system undermines the presumption of innocence ¶ for these defendants, and risks a broader erosion of defendants’ rights that could spread to ¶ traditional Article III trials.7¶ It was Justice Frankfurter who wrote that “It is a fair summary of ¶ history to say that the safeguards of liberty have frequently been forged in controversies ¶ involving not very nice people.”8¶ Committee members strongly believe that the shadow of ¶ ten’;;’nnnnrrorism must not be the basis for abandoning these fundamental tenets of justice and ¶ fairness.</p><p>More funding overcomes logistical barriers<br/>Inderfurth 9<br/>Ashley Inderfurth and Wayne Massey, American Bar Association Standing Committee on Law and National Security, Due Process and Terrorism Series, Trying Terrorists in Article III Courts, Challenges and Lessons Learned, A Post-Workshop Report July 2009<br/>In addition to evidentiary challenges, terrorism trials conducted in Article III courts pose a number of practical challenges in managing the courtroom, the defendant, and the jury. While there are no codified methods for managing ter- rorism trials, judges and other court officials have created a variety of successful ad hoc procedures. The ad hoc procedures include methods for protecting juries and the courtroom, protecting the security of classified information, and control- ling public disclosures. However, a number of major dilemmas remain. For example, terrorism trials continue to require huge commitments of both time and resources. There are also serious issues associated with the conditions of deten- tion of terrorist suspects that are largely unresolved. Furthermore, managing individual and courthouse security remains a problematic endeavor because the cases may be highly publicized.¶ The logistical problems a judge faces in managing terrorism trials can be divided generally into three categories, though there is substantial overlap between them. First, the court must manage its own ability to fairly adjudicate the trial, a responsibility made more difficult due to non-security-cleared clerks and large amounts of classified and sensitive evidence. Second, the court must manage the defendant, including the defendant’s isolated conditions of detention, cultural and language barriers, and right to proceed pro se. Third, the court must manage the jury, including its selection, security, and its needs and perceptions during the trial.¶ In beginning the discussion, the participants generally agreed that trial management issues in the Article III framework have been either exaggerated or resolved successfully on an ad hoc basis, at least for the cases actually pursued in the regular Article III courts (several discussants asserted that the government has forgone criminal prosecutions at times because of insurmountable, or at least very difficult, issues not handled by an Article III court to date). Discussants repeatedly emphasized that the need for flexibility is paramount because often the best results have been reached in Article III terrorism trials through cooperation and compromise on the part of the government, the defense, and the court. The most significant practical challenges to the viability of Article III courts in conducting terrorism trials are the extreme trial lengths and the high costs. Some terrorism trials last a period of months, placing great strain on the court’s resources and the jurors’ lives.37 While significant challenges remain, the discussants generally agreed that with sufficient allocation of resources, most of the logistical and practical challenges posed by terrorism trials could be handled in Article III courts.</p><div

In the IPCC’s 2001 report was a graph that purported to show the earth’s mean temperature since the year 1000. A yet more extreme version of the hockey stick graph made the cover of the Fiftieth Anniversary Report of the United Nation’s World Meteorological Organization. To the surprise of everyone who knew about the strong evidence for the little ice age and the medieval climate optimum, the graph showed a nearly constant temperature from the year 1000 until about 150 years ago, when the temperature began to rise abruptly like the blade of a hockey stick. The inference was that this was due to the anthropogenic “pollutant” CO2.<br/>This damnatia memoriae of inconvenient … A. W.

Among the files released were e-mails between members of the power structure of the climate crusade, “the team.” These files were, or should have been, very embarrassing to their senders and recipients.

My experience is that nation-states are generally either encouraged or deterred by their sort of cost-benefit calculation, and so I -- as other countries develop drones of their own, I think that they will make their own decisions on how they -- on how they use them, looking at the United States' experience but drawing on their own -- on their -- on their own interests and fears. I think that nonstate organizations, terrorist groups, extremist groups, are not deterrable, and they look at U.S. norms in order to find weaknesses in them, not to -- not to be led by them. And they -- if a terrorist group can get hold of drone technology, it will use it against us every way we can.

The Dangers of judicial Intervention Faced with the prospect that congressional participation can sometimes play a salutary role in avoiding unnecessary wars, an antecedent question naturally arises. Should the courts decide if such a congressional role would be appropriate? Indeed, a recurring theme running through much of the Congress-first literature is that judicial intervention is necessary to vindicate the congressional role in initiating conflicts. But if one accepts the signaling model developed here, there are significant reasons why one ought to be wary of a judicial role in resolving war powers controversies. First, under our model of international crisis bargaining, judicial review would likely undermine the value of signals sent by the President when he seeks legislative authorization to go to war. In other words, it is the fact that the signal is both costly and discretionary that often makes it valuable. Once one understands that regime characteristics can influence the informational value of signaling, it makes sense that the President should have the maximum flexibility to choose less costly signals when dealing with rogue states or terrorist organizations. The alternative- a judicial rule that mandates costly signals in all circumstances, even when such signals have little or no informational value to the foreign adversary-would dilute the overall value of such signals. Second, judicial review would preclude the possibility of beneficial bargaining between the President and Congress by forcing warmaking into a procedural straitjacket. In this picture, judicial review would constrain the political branches to adopt only the tying hands type of signal regardless of the nature or stage of an international crisis. But the supposed restraining effect attributed to the tying hands signal can vary considerably depending on whether the democracy is deciding to initiate an international crisis or is already in the midst of an escalating crisis. Requiring legislative authorization may make it less likely that the democracy will be willing to back out of a conflict once it starts. Thus, tying hand signals and judicial insistence that the President seek legislative authorization will contribute to greater international instability once a conflict has already started.</p><p>Political question doctrine key to maintain “one voice” in foreign policy, that’s key to US credibility <br/>Abebe 12 (Daniel, Professor of Law, University of Chicago Law School, JD Harvard Law School, PhD in Political Science, University of Chicago, “One Voice or Many?

Let’s start … every region of the world.<br/>By these military and economic measures, at least, the United States today is not remotely like Britain circa 1900, when that empire’s relative decline began to become apparent.

Why non-nuclear states are not deterred from fighting nuclear states is an important and open question. But in a time when calls to ban the Bomb are being heard from more and more quarters, we must be clear about precisely what the broad trends toward peace can and cannot tell us.

I think that nonstate organizations, terrorist groups, extremist groups, are not deterrable, and they look at U.S. norms in order to find weaknesses in them, not to -- not to be led by them.

In so doing, the Court has expanded its authority vis-A-vis the President. Obama administration efforts to moot al-Marri and to relocate Uighur detainees (thereby¶ mooting that litigation) speak to the administration's desire to avoid¶ Supreme Court rulings that might limit the scope of presidential¶ power. Unlike the Bush administration (whose politically tone deaf¶ arguments paved the way for anti-administration rulings), 84 the Obama administration understands that the Court has become a player¶ in the enemy combatant issue.¶ What is striking here, is that the Court never took more than it¶ could get-it carved out space for itself without risking the nation's¶ security or political backlash. Its 2004 and 2006 rulings provided ample opportunity for the President to pursue his enemy combatant initiative. Its 2008 ruling in Boumediene, while clearly constraining the¶ political branches, reflected the views of the new Democratic majority¶ in Congress and (to a lesser extent) the views of presidential candidates Obama and McCain. 8 Its decision to steer clear of early Obt &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ama-era disputes likewise avoids the risks of a costly backlash while¶ creating incentives for the Obama administration to take judicial authority into account (by settling these cases outside of court).186 Put¶ another way, by taking prevailing social and political forces into account, the Court was able to flex its muscles without meaningfully¶ undermining the policy preferences of the President and Congress.</p><p>Collapses the economy – kills corporate seperateness, deters investment, causes retaliation<br/>Rutledge 13 (Peter, Counsel of Record, Professor at University of Georgia College of Law,"RIEF OF THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, THE NATIONAL FOREIGN TRADE COUNCIL, THE FEDERATION OF GERMAN INDUSTRIES, THE ASSOCIATION OF GERMAN CHAMBERS OF INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE, AND THE ORGANIZATION FOR INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT AS AMICI CURIAE IN SUPPORT OF THE PETITIONER," www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publications/supreme_court_preview/briefs-v2/11-965_pet_amcu_us-coc_etal.authcheckdam.pdf)<br/>Second, holding that corporations are amenable to general jurisdiction only in forums where they are “at home” has salutary effects on foreign commerce.

Such investment “creates well-paid jobs, contributes to economic growth, boosts produc- tivity and supports American communities.” State- ment by President Barack Obama on the United States Commitment to Open Investment Policy (June 20, 2011).¶ Extraordinary assertions of jurisdiction can frus- trate this commerce-promotion objective. “Overseas firms . . . could be deterred from doing business here.” Stoneridge Inv. Partners, LLC v. Scientific-Atlanta, 552 U.S. 148, 164 (2008); cf. Japan Line, Ltd. v. Los Angeles County, 441 U.S. 434 (1979). While such concerns often are articulated in the context of prescriptive jurisdiction, the commerce-frustrating effects of the capacious approach to general adjudica- tory jurisdiction exemplified by Judge Reinhardt’s panel opinion are potentially far worse. Whereas prescriptive jurisdiction rules subject foreign com- panies to account for specific claims, general jurisdiction rules make them answerable in the forum’s courts for all claims regardless of where they occurred. This makes the foreign company a tempting target for plaintiffs, who may simply join the foreign company in litigation as a part of an effort to obtain settlement leverage. Even if a lower court¶ 19¶ eventually dismisses the foreign company from the case, such relief may come only after costly and burdensome jurisdictional discovery, as this case well illustrates, see Pet. App. 80a. Thus, as the United States Government has acknowledged, extraordinary assertions of general jurisdiction “may dissuade foreign companies from doing business in the United States thereby depriving United States consumers of the full benefits of foreign trade.” Brief for the United States as Amicus Curiae Supporting Petitioners in Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S.A. v. Brown, No. 10-76 (“Goodyear Brief ”) at 12.¶ The threat to foreign-commerce promotion affects domestic companies too. As the judges dissenting from rehearing en banc correctly recognized, sweep- ing assertions of jurisdiction over foreign companies threaten U.S. companies with retaliatory assertions by foreign courts. Pet. App. 144a. Concern about retaliation against American companies has prompted this Court to proceed cautiously when permitting the exercise of prescriptive jurisdiction over foreign com- panies. See, e.g., Japan Line, 441 U.S. at 450; McCulloch v. Sociedad Nacional de Marineros de Honduras, 372 U.S. 10, 17 (1963). Those same concerns should animate the rules governing ad- judicatory jurisdiction. European officials recently revised the rules governing the adjudicatory jurisdic- tion of member-state courts and considered changes to the rules governing jurisdiction over companies, like those in the United States, not organized in member states. See Council Regulation 2012/1215, art. 6, 2012 O.J. (L351) 1, 7 (EU); Commission of the European Communities, Green Paper on the Review of Council Regulation (EC) 44/2001 on Jurisdiction and the Recognition and Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters at 3-4 (Apr. 21,¶ 20¶ 2009). Foreign jurisdictional rules are far less likely to reflect a hostile approach toward U.S. companies if our own rules regarding adjudicatory jurisdiction over foreign companies are similarly measured.</p><p>Global economic crisis causes war---statistics and empirics <br/>Royal 10 – Jedediah Royal, Director of Cooperative Threat Reduction at the U.S. Department of Defense, 2010, “Economic Integration, Economic Signaling and the Problem of Economic Crises,” in Economics of War and Peace: Economic, Legal and Political Perspectives, ed.

Indeed, whether used by states, terror groups or dispersed in industrial accidents, they tend to be far less destructive than conventional weapons. 'If we stopped speculating about things that might happen in the future and looked instead at what has happened in the past, we'd see that our fears about WMD are misplaced', he says. &nbsp;Yet such fears remain widespread. Post-9/11, American and British leaders have issued dire warnings about terrorists getting hold of WMD and causing mass murder and mayhem. President George W Bush has spoken of terrorists who, 'if they ever gained weapons of mass destruction', would 'kill hundreds of thousands, without hesitation and without mercy' (1). &nbsp;The British government has spent £28million on stockpiling millions of smallpox vaccines, even though there's no evidence that terrorists have got access to smallpox, which was eradicated as a natural disease in the 1970s and now exists only in two high-security labs in America and Russia (2). In 2002, British nurses became the first in the world to get training in how to deal with the victims of bioterrorism (3). &nbsp;The UK Home Office's 22-page pamphlet on how to survive a terror attack, published last month, included tips on what to do in the event of a 'chemical, biological or radiological attack' ('Move away from the immediate source of danger', it usefully advised). Spine-chilling books such as Plague Wars: A True Story of Biological Warfare, The New Face of Terrorism: Threats From Weapons of Mass Destruction and The Survival Guide: What to Do in a Biological, Chemical or Nuclear Emergency speculate over what kind of horrors WMD might wreak. TV docudramas, meanwhile, explore how Britain might cope with a smallpox assault and what would happen if London were 'dirty nuked' (4). &nbsp;The term 'weapons of mass destruction' refers to three types of weapons: nuclear, chemical and biological. A chemical weapon is any weapon that uses a manufactured chemical, such as sarin, mustard gas or hydrogen cyanide, to kill or injure. A biological weapon uses bacteria or viruses, such as smallpox or anthrax, to cause destruction - inducing sickness and disease as a means of undermining enemy forces or inflicting civilian casualties. We find such weapons repulsive, because of the horrible way in which the victims convulse and die - but they appear to be less 'destructive' than conventional weapons. &nbsp;'We know that nukes are massively destructive, there is a lot of evidence for that', says Rapoport. But when it comes to chemical and biological weapons, 'the evidence suggests that we should call them "weapons of minimum destruction", not mass destruction', he says. &nbsp;Chemical weapons have most commonly been used by states, in military warfare. Rapoport explored various state uses of chemicals over the past hundred years: both sides used them in the First World War; Italy deployed chemicals against the Ethiopians in the 1930s; the Japanese used chemicals against the Chinese in the 1930s and again in the Second World War; Egypt and Libya used them in the Yemen and Chad in the postwar period; most recently, Saddam Hussein's Iraq used chemical weapons, first in the war against Iran (1980-1988) and then against its own Kurdish population at the tail-end of the Iran-Iraq war. &nbsp;In each instance, says Rapoport, chemical weapons were used more in desperation than from a position of strength or a desire to cause mass destruction. 'The evidence is that states rarely use them even when they have them', he has written. 'Only when a military stalemate has developed, which belligerents who have become desperate want to break, are they used.' (5) As to whether such use of chemicals was effective, Rapoport says that at best it blunted an offensive - but this very rarely, if ever, translated into a decisive strategic shift in the war, because the original stalemate continued after the chemical weapons had been deployed. &nbsp;He points to the example of Iraq. The Baathists used chemicals against Iran when that nasty trench-fought war had reached yet another stalemate. As Efraim Karsh argues in his paper 'The Iran-Iraq War: A Military Analysis': 'Iraq employed chemical weapons only in vital segments of the front and only when it saw no other way to check Iranian offensives. Chemical weapons had a negligible impact on the war, limited to tactical rather than strategic effects.' (6) &nbsp;According to Rapoport, this 'negligible' impact of chemical weapons on the direction of a war is reflected in the disparity between the numbers of casualties caused by chemicals and the numbers caused by conventional weapons. It is estimated that the use of gas in the Iran-Iraq war killed 5,000 - but the Iranian side suffered around 600,000 dead in total, meaning that gas killed less than one per cent. &nbsp;The deadliest use of gas occurred in the First World War but, as Rapoport points out, it still only accounted for five per cent of casualties. Studying the amount of gas used by both sides from1914-1918 relative to the number of fatalities gas caused, Rapoport has written: 'It took a ton of gas in that war to achieve a single enemy fatality. Wind and sun regularly dissipated the lethality of the gases. Furthermore, those gassed were 10 to 12 times as likely to recover than those casualties produced by traditional weapons.' (7) &nbsp;Indeed, Rapoport discovered that some earlier documenters of the First World War had a vastly different assessment of chemical weapons than we have today - they considered the use of such weapons to be preferable to bombs and guns, because chemicals caused fewer fatalities. One wrote: 'Instead of being the most horrible form of warfare, it is the most humane, because it disables far more than it kills, ie, it has a low fatality ratio.' (8) 'Imagine that', says Rapoport, 'WMD being referred to as more humane'. He says that the contrast between such assessments and today's fears shows that actually looking at the evidence has benefits, allowing 'you to see things more rationally'. &nbsp;According to Rapoport, even Saddam's use of gas against the Kurds of Halabja in 1988 - the most recent use by a state of chemical weapons and the most commonly cited as evidence of the dangers of 'rogue states' getting their hands on WMD - does not show that unconventional weapons are more destructive than conventional ones. Of course the attack on Halabja was horrific, but he points out that the circumstances surrounding the assault remain unclear. &nbsp;'The estimates of how many were killed vary greatly', he tells me. 'Some say 400, others say 5,000, others say more than 5,000. The fighter planes that attacked the civilians used conventional as well as unconventional weapons; I have seen no study which explores how many were killed by chemicals and how many were killed by firepower. We all find these attacks repulsive, but the death toll may actually have been greater if conventional bombs only were used. We know that conventional weapons can be more destructive.' &nbsp;Rapoport says that terrorist use of chemical and biological weapons is similar to state use - in that it is rare and, in terms of causing mass destruction, not very effective. He cites the work of journalist and author John Parachini, who says that over the past 25 years only four significant attempts by terrorists to use WMD have been recorded. The most effective WMD-attack by a non-state group, from a military perspective, was carried out by the Tamil Tigers of Sri Lanka in 1990. They used chlorine gas against Sri Lankan soldiers guarding a fort, injuring over 60 soldiers but killing none. &nbsp;The Tamil Tigers' use of chemicals angered their support base, when some of the chlorine drifted back into Tamil territory - confirming Rapoport's view that one problem with using unpredictable and unwieldy chemical and biological weapons over conventional weapons is that the cost can be as great 'to the attacker as to the attacked'. The Tigers have not used WMD since.</p><p>Gave up bioweapons<br/>Palmquist 2008 (Matt, “How and why the threat of bioterrorism has been so greatly exaggerated.” 5-19-08. <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.miller-mccune.com/politics/bioterror-in-context-355)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.miller-mccune.com/politics/bioterror-in-context-355)%27" tppabs="http://www.miller-mccune.com/politics/bioterror-in-context-355)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.miller-mccune.com/politics/bioterror-in-context-355)</span></a></span><br/>Clark: The more I looked into it, I thought, "Jeez, what are these guys talking about?" What are the odds that a terrorist group, no matter how well financed, would be able to create a bioterror weapon? I began looking into what it takes to really make a successful bioterrorism agent, and I just became very skeptical of this whole thing. The (United States ) military gave up bioweapons 30 years ago. They're too undependable; they're too hard to use; they're too hard to make. Then I started checking around, and I found there's a whole literature out there of people who've been screaming for years that this whole bioterrorism thing is really overblown; it's not practical; it's never going to work. Aum Shinrikyo couldn't get it to work; those guys put millions and millions of dollars into it. So you think of a bunch of guys sitting in a cave in Afghanistan &nbsp;– &nbsp;they're sure as hell not going to do it. Is any government going to do it? No. So that made me very skeptical, and I went back to Oxford and said, "This whole thing's a crock." And they said, "But that's even more interesting!"<br/>M-M: Thus the question mark at the end of the title, Bracing for Armageddon?<br/>Clark: Yeah, exactly. Scientifically, it is a crock. And this really verges into the political, but we've spent $50 billion on it. So Oxford paid for me to take a trip back East and talk to a bunch of these voices that haven't been heard and interview them.<br/>M-M: How much research was involved?<br/>Clark: A couple of years. The science is pretty straightforward on paper. The kind of an organization you'd have to put together, with the varying expertise that is required to make one of these things and deploy it, takes a whole group of people with all kinds of different skills, from engineers to meteorologists. That's just not going to happen. You can run an airplane into an office tower, and you get instant everything you could ever possibly hope for. So why would anybody sit around for years and years? The Aum Shinrikyo guys tried for six, seven years and couldn't get it to work. And a lot of them had Ph.D.s.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>1NR</p><p>National security deference issues will be in the political spotlight – guarantees a link<br/>Chesney 9 (Robert M., Professor, University of Texas School of Law, October, “NATIONAL SECURITY FACT DEFERENCE”, 95 Va.

Military Leadership And Decisionmaking Would Suffer War is the province of chance. “If we now consider briefly the subjective nature of war—the means by which war has to be fought—it will look more than ever like a gamble . . . in the whole range of human activities, war most closely resembles a game of cards.” Clausewitz, 86-87. Within this field of human endeavor, the most successful armies are those led by decisive commanders who visualize the operational environment and make rapid, sound decisions. Combat leadership involves the motivation of others to risk their lives, and only the most decisive and confident leaders can inspire this kind of self-sacrifice. Leadership is the multiplying and unifying element of combat power. Confident, competent, and informed leadership intensifies the effectiveness of all other elements of combat power by formulating sound operational ideas and assuring discipline and motivation in the force . . . Leadership in today’s operational environment is often the difference between success and failure.

Battle command is the art and science of understanding, visualizing, describing, directing, leading, and assessing forces to impose the commander’s will on a hostile, thinking, and adaptive enemy. Battle command applies leadership to translate decisions into actions—by synchronizing forces and warfighting functions in time, space, and purpose—to accomplish missions. Battle command is guided by professional judgment gained from experience, knowledge, education, intelligence, and intuition. It is driven by commanders. Id. at ¶ 5-9. Battlefield decisionmaking involves the visualization of the battlefield and all its components, the deliberate assessment of operational risk, and the selection of a course of action which accepts certain risks in order to achieve tactical, operational or strategic success. Id. at ¶ 5-10; see also Gen. Frederick M. Franks, Jr., Battle Command: A Commander’s Perspective, Military Review, May-June 1996, at 120-121. “Given the inherently uncertain nature of war, the object of planning is not to eliminate or minimize uncertainty but to foster decisive and effective action in the midst of such uncertainty.” Army Field Manual 3-07, Stability Operations, at ¶ 4-4 (2008), available at <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://usacac.army.mil/cac2/repository/FM307/FM307.pdf.  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://usacac.army.mil/cac2/repository/FM307/FM307.pdf.%27" tppabs="http://usacac.army.mil/cac2/repository/FM307/FM307.pdf."><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://usacac.army.mil/cac2/repository/FM307/FM307.pdf.</span></a></span> In bringing this case, Plaintiff asks this Court to substitute itself as the battlefield commander, and to second-guess the strategic, operational and tactical decisions made by this nation’s military chain of command in the campaign against Al Qaeda. Judicial decisionmaking is incompatible with military decisionmaking. Rather than produce rapid, confident, decisive actions, judicial resolution of this matter would produce deliberate and measured decisions which are the product of adversarial process, and which would reflect judicial considerations, not strategic or tactical ones. Also, judicial involvement may induce risk aversion among commanders, who would worry about how their actions might be judged in courtrooms far removed from the battlefield, and thus hedge their battlefield decisions in order to protect themselves and their units from future judicial scrutiny. This is particularly true of Plaintiff’s prayer for relief, which calls upon the Court to enjoin the Government from using lethal force “except in circumstances in which they present concrete, specific, and imminent threats to life or physical safety, and there are no means other than lethal force that could reasonably be employed to neutralize the threats.” Such decisions about the use of force can often be made by soldiers in a split-second, on the basis of intuition and training. The specter of judicial involvement will affect the way soldiers and leaders approach these decisions, potentially complicating and slowing their decisions by injecting judicial considerations which have no place on the battlefield.</p><p>Unit cohesion – that’s key. &nbsp;Also risk aversion.<br/>VFW 10 (The Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States, Brief of The veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States As amicus curiae in support of defendants and dismissal, 09/30/10, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.lawfareblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/VFW_Brief_PACER.pdf)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.lawfareblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/VFW_Brief_PACER.pdf)%27" tppabs="http://www.lawfareblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/VFW_Brief_PACER.pdf)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.lawfareblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/VFW_Brief_PACER.pdf)</span></a></span><br/>As a member organization comprised of … their mission and their safety.&nbsp;</p><p>Risk aversion key – kills perceptions of resolve<br/>Gerson 09 - Research analyst @ Center for Naval Analyses, a federally funded research center, where he focuses on deterrence, nuclear strategy, counterproliferation, and arms control MICHAEL S.

The Dangers of judicial Intervention Faced with the prospect that congressional participation can sometimes play a salutary role in avoiding unnecessary wars, an antecedent question naturally arises. Should the courts decide if such a congressional role would be appropriate? Indeed, a recurring theme running through much of the Congress-first literature is that judicial intervention is necessary to vindicate the congressional role in initiating conflicts. But if one accepts the signaling model developed here, there are significant reasons why one ought to be wary of a judicial role in resolving war powers controversies. First, under our model of international crisis bargaining, judicial review would likely undermine the value of signals sent by the President when he seeks legislative authorization to go to war. In other words, it is the fact that the signal is both costly and discretionary that often makes it valuable. Once one understands that regime characteristics can influence the informational value of signaling, it makes sense that the President should have the maximum flexibility to choose less costly signals when dealing with rogue states or terrorist organizations. The alternative- a judicial rule that mandates costly signals in all circumstances, even when such signals have little or no informational value to the foreign adversary-would dilute the overall value of such signals. Second, judicial review would preclude the possibility of beneficial bargaining between the President and Congress by forcing warmaking into a procedural straitjacket. In this picture, judicial review would constrain the political branches to adopt only the tying hands type of signal regardless of the nature or stage of an international crisis. But the supposed restraining effect attributed to the tying hands signal can vary considerably depending on whether the democracy is deciding to initiate an international crisis or is already in the midst of an escalating crisis. Requiring legislative authorization may make it less likely that the democracy will be willing to back out of a conflict once it starts. Thus, tying hand signals and judicial insistence that the President seek legislative authorization will contribute to greater international instability once a conflict has already started.</p><p>Not about leaks its about SPECIFIC SUITS on information<br/>VFW 10 (The Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States, Brief of The veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States As amicus curiae in support of defendants and dismissal, 09/30/10, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.lawfareblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/VFW_Brief_PACER.pdf)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.lawfareblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/VFW_Brief_PACER.pdf)%27" tppabs="http://www.lawfareblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/VFW_Brief_PACER.pdf)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.lawfareblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/VFW_Brief_PACER.pdf)</span></a></span><br/>D. Special Operations Require Protection … operations forces—Army Rangers and <br/>Special Forces, Navy SEALs, Air Force parajumpers and combat controllers, and Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance personnel, among others. These elite warriors conduct highly dangerous missions today in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other countries around the world. By definition, special operations “are operations conducted in hostile, denied, or politically sensitive environments to achieve military, diplomatic, informational, and/or economic objectives employing military capabilities for which there is no broad conventional force requirement. These operations often require covert, clandestine, or low-visibility capabilities.” U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Joint Pub. 3-05, Doctrine for Joint Special Operations, at I-1 (2003), available at <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/new_pubs/jp3_05.pdf.  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/new_pubs/jp3_05.pdf.%27" tppabs="http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/new_pubs/jp3_05.pdf."><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/new_pubs/jp3_05.pdf.</span></a></span> Special operations are differentiated from conventional operations in many ways, but foremost among these are their “degree of physical and political risk, operational techniques, mode of employment, independence from friendly support, and dependence on detailed operational intelligence and indigenous assets.” Id. “Surprise is often the most important principle in the conduct of successful special operations and the survivability of employed special operations forces,” and the very nature of special operations requires “high levels of security . . . to protect the clandestine/covert nature of missions.” Id. at I-6. More than mission accomplishment is at stake—“given their operating size, special operations teams are more vulnerable to potential hostile reaction to their presence than larger conventional units,” and therefore the protection of sources and methods is essential for the survival of special operations forces. Id. To preserve this element of surprise, special operations forces must broadly conceal their tactics, techniques and procedures, including information about unit locations and movements, targeting decisions, and operational plans for future missions. Disclosure of this information would allow this nation’s adversaries to defend themselves more effectively, potentially inflicting more casualties upon U.S. special operations forces. Such disclosure would also provide information about how the U.S. military gathers information about its adversaries, enabling terrorist groups like Al Qaeda to alter its communications and activities in order to evade future detection and action by the U.S. Government. Such harm would not be limited to just this instance or terrorist group group; these disclosures would also provide future terrorist adversaries and military adversaries with insight into U.S. special operations capabilities which would enable them to counter such capabilities in future conflicts. Cf. Public Declaration of Robert M. Gates, Secretary of Defense, Govt. Exhibit 4, September 23, 2010, at ¶¶ 6-7. In this matter, the Plaintiff asks the Court to pull back the veil on the U.S. special operations community, exposing special operations sources and methods to the public, including this nation’s enemies. This would do tremendous harm to current special operations personnel, including VFW members, who are operating abroad in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere, and who depend on stealth, security and surprise for their survival and mission accomplishment. Further, in his prayer for relief, Plaintiff asks the Court to order the disclosure of “the criteria that are used in determining whether the government will carry out the targeted killing of a U.S. citizen.” As Secretary Gates states in his public declaration filed by the Government, without confirming or denying any allegation made by Plaintiff, this type of information “constitutes highly sensitive and classified military information that cannot be disclosed without causing serious harm to the national security of the United States.” Id. at ¶ 5. These criteria necessarily reflect the sources, methods and analytic processes used to produce them, and would tend to reveal other information about military sources and methods which are essential to the success and survival of special operations personnel.&nbsp;</p><p>Special forces are key to … nuclear strikes which cause extinction <br/>Jim Thomas 13, Vice President and Director of Studies at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, and Chris Dougherty is a Research Fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, 2013, “BEYOND THE RAMPARTS THE FUTURE OF U.S. SPECIAL OPERATIONS FORCES,” <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.csbaonline.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/SOF-Report-CSBA-Final.pdf  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.csbaonline.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/SOF-Report-CSBA-Final.pdf%27" tppabs="http://www.csbaonline.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/SOF-Report-CSBA-Final.pdf"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.csbaonline.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/SOF-Report-CSBA-Final.pdf</span></a></span><br/>Finally, if the United States … when confronting WMD-armed adversaries.</p><p>Prolif snowballs – empirics prove<br/>Kroenig 12 (Matthew Kroenig, Assistant Professor of Government, Georgetown University and Stanton Nuclear Security Fellow, Council on Foreign Relations, June 4, 2012, “The history of proliferation optimism: does it have a future?” <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://npolicy.org/article_file/The_History_of_Proliferation_Optimism.pdf)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://npolicy.org/article_file/The_History_of_Proliferation_Optimism.pdf)%27" tppabs="http://npolicy.org/article_file/The_History_of_Proliferation_Optimism.pdf)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://npolicy.org/article_file/The_History_of_Proliferation_Optimism.pdf)</span></a></span></p><p>Further proliferation. &nbsp;Nuclear proliferation poses … a strategically important and volatile region.</p><p>Failure of counterinsurgency is a misnomer<br/>Wohlforth, 07 – Olin Fellow in International Security Studies at Yale &nbsp;(William, “Unipolar Stability”, Harvard International Review, Spring, &nbsp;<span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://hir.harvard.edu/articles/1611/)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://hir.harvard.edu/articles/1611/)%27" tppabs="http://hir.harvard.edu/articles/1611/)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://hir.harvard.edu/articles/1611/)</span></a></span></p><p>To begin with, the challenge of converting power-as-resources into power-as-influence is not a uniquely US problem.

Yet in 2007, its inability to suppress the Iraqi counterinsurgency and civil war seems to have revealed feet of clay. All the hard data on US military superiority—its over one-half of global defense spending, some 70 percent of global military RandD, and dominance in information-intensive warfare—now appear in a new light.

Disability is not inevitable. Only two things are always temporary: life, and youth. Everything else is conditional, contextual, and/or statistical. Definitions of ability/disability are exceedingly complex; even definitions of "aging" are less obvious than they might immediately appear.<br/>Ability is not always temporary. Two large groups of people are able-bodied <br/>AND<br/>permanent either: the world is full of people who are temporarily disabled.<br/>To return to our catch-phrase, "temporarily able-bodied" is <br/>AND<br/>pain say they "feel old," when what they feel is pain.</p><p>More evidence <br/>HOPE 2009 (Kinsey, identifies as mentally and physically disabled, "The Body Is Not The Only Aspect That Can Be Abled," Genderbitch: Musings of a Trans Chick, Nov 16, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://genderbitch.wordpress.com/2009/11/16/the-case-for-cab-m/)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://genderbitch.wordpress.com/2009/11/16/the-case-for-cab-m/)%27" tppabs="http://genderbitch.wordpress.com/2009/11/16/the-case-for-cab-m/)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://genderbitch.wordpress.com/2009/11/16/the-case-for-cab-m/)</span></a></span><br/>There’s something that twigs me out a bit about the abbreviation TAB. But first, for those not in the know, let’s go over what it means.<br/>It means Temporarily Able Bodied. It summarizes fairly well the counter situation to many <br/>AND<br/>tool used for discourse and community in the same way that PWD does.<br/>It also explains the temporal nature of not possessing disabilities. It just takes an <br/>AND<br/>being abled, it’s also one of the most frequently erased and ignored.)<br/>But there is a flaw. A serious, even ableist flaw in the terminology. And that is what twigs me out.<br/>Have you noticed it yet? Temporarily Abled Bodied. You might say, "<br/>AND<br/>(learning disability), Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and a host of other zones.<br/>Then there’s the issue my partner pointed out when helping me proofread this post. Even temporarily is problematic. Some folk never have a disability. Aging doesn’t do too much to them in those terms and some folk have things calm down or disappear. "Currently" is the word being suggested to fix this, so I’m just going to slide that into the terms right now.<br/>This is, obviously, a problem. And it’s one that’s very simple to <br/>AND<br/>including all the aspects that are subject to it. Body and Mind.<br/>So I suggest this: Currently Able Bodied/Minded. Or CAB/M <br/>AND<br/>all PWD folk, intersection or primary line, either and any way.<br/>So there it is. The case for CAB/M, instead of TAB (or even just CAB). I hope it catches on.

Geopolitical Strategic Considerations Bearing on Judicial Interpretation<br/>Before the United States Supreme Court Justices form an opinion on the legality of national security decisions by the POTUS, they should immerse themselves in judicially-noticeable facts concerning what national security expert, Bruce Berkowitz, in the subtitle of his recent book, calls the "challengers, competitors, and threats to America's future." n23 Not that the Justices need to become experts in national security affairs, n24 but every Supreme Court Justice should be aware of the following five basic national security facts and conceptions before sitting in judgment on presiprudential national security determinations.<br/>(1) "National security policy . . . is … themselves with regional powers." n27<br/>(2) "Yet, as worrisome as these immediate concerns may be, the long-term challenges are even harder to deal with, and the stakes are higher. Whereas the main Cold War threat--the Soviet Union--was brittle, most of the potential adversaries and challengers America now faces are resilient." n28<br/>(3) "The most important task … advantage, they do not." n30<br/>(4) While "keeping the strategic advantage may not have the idealistic ring of making the world safe for democracy and does not sound as decisively macho as maintaining American hegemony," n31 maintaining the American "strategic advantage is critical, because it is essential for just about everything else America hopes to achieve--promoting freedom, protecting the homeland, defending its values, preserving peace, and so on." n32<br/>(5) The United States requires … focus its own resources." n34<br/>&nbsp;*888 &nbsp;As further serious preparation for engaging in the jurisprudence of American national security presiprudence in hotly contested cases and controversies that may end up on their docket, our Supreme Court Justices should understand that, as Walter Russell Mead pointed out in an important essay a few years ago, n35 the average American can be understood as a Jacksonian pragmatist on national security issues. n36 "Americans are determined to keep the world at a distance, while not isolating ourselves from it completely. If we need to take action abroad, we want to do it on our terms." n37 Thus, recent social science survey data paints "a picture of a country whose practical people take a practical approach to knowledge about national security. Americans do not bother with the details most of the time because, for most Americans, the details do not matter most the time." n38 Indeed, since the American people "do know the outlines of the big picture and what we need to worry about in national security affairs so we know when we need to pay greater attention and what is at stake. This is the kind of knowledge suited to a Jacksonian." n39<br/>Turning to how the Supreme … his national security executive subordinates.</p><p>norms</p><p>No norm creation or national security threat from drone prolif – won’t be used by terrorists or in state based conflict<br/>Lewis and Crawford 13 – (Michael, Professor of Law at Ohio Northern University Pettit College of Law, and Emily, PhD, post-doctoral fellow and associate at the Sydney Centre for International Law, &nbsp;“Drones and Distinction: How IHL Encouraged the Rise of Drones,” Georgetown Journal of International Law, Vol. 44)<br/>Before discussing the legal merits … target individuals across the globe.” 168</p><p>China won’t use drones offensively<br/>Erickson 13, associate professor – Naval War College, associate in research – Fairbank Centre @ Harvard, 5/23/13<br/>(Andrew, China Has Drones.

Brooks, Assistant Professor of Government at Dartmouth, and William C. Wohlforth, Associate Professor of Government at Dartmouth, 2008, World Out of Balance: International Relations and the Challenge of American Primacy, p. 201-206<br/>First, empirical studies find no … established a committee to monitor compliance.<br/>That said, there is also evidence of resistance to U.S. attempts to rewrite rules or exempt itself from rules. Arguably the most salient example of this is the International Criminal Court (ICC). During the negotiations on the Rome Convention in the late 1990s, the United States explicitly sought to preserve great-power control over ICC jurisdiction. U.S. representatives argued that the United States needed protection from a more independent ICC in order to continue to provide the public good of global military intervention. When this logic failed to persuade the majority, U.S. officials shifted to purely legal arguments, but, as noted, these foundered on the inconsistency created by Washington’s strong support of war crimes tribunals for others. The Rome Convention rejected the U.S. view in favor of the majority position granting the ICC judicial panel authority to refer cases to court’s jurisdiction.78 By 2007, 130 states had signed the treaty and over 100 were full-fledged parties to it.<br/>President Clinton signed the treaty, but declined to submit it to the Senate for ratification. The Bush administration “unsigned” it in order legally to be able to take action to undermine it. The United States then persuaded over 75 countries to enter into agreements under which they undertake not to send any U.S. citizen to the ICC without the United States’ consent; importantly, these agreements do not obligate the United States to investigate or prosecute any American accused of involvement in war crimes. This clearly undermines the ICC, especially given that about half the states that have signed these special agreements with the United States are also parties to the Rome Statute. 79 At the same time, the EU and other ICC supporters pressured governments not to sign special agreements with the United States, and some 45 have refused to do so—about half losing U.S. military assistance as a result. In April 2005, the United States chose not to veto a UN Security Council resolution referring the situation in Darfur, Sudan, to the ICC. To many observers, this suggests that inconsistency may yet undermine U.S. opposition to the court.80 If the U.S. campaign to thwart the court fails, and there is no compromise solution that meets some American concerns, the result will be a small but noticeable constraint: U.S. citizens involved in what might be construed as war crimes and who are not investigated and prosecuted by the U.S. legal system may have to watch where they travel.<br/>The upshot as of 2007 was something of a stalemate on the ICC, demonstrating the limits of both the United States’ capability to quash a new legal institution it doesn’t like and the Europeans’ ability to legitimize such an institution without the United States’ participation. Similar stalemates characterize other high-profile arguments over other new international legal instruments, such as the Kyoto Protocol on Climate Change and the Ottawa Landmine Convention. Exactly as constructivists suggest, these outcomes lend credence to the argument that power does not translate unproblematically into legitimacy. What the larger pattern of evidence on rule breaking shows, however, is that this is only one part of the story; the other part involves rule breaking with few, if any, legitimacy costs, and the frequent use of go-it-alone power to revise or create rules.<br/>AN EROSION OF THE ORDER?<br/>The second general evidence pattern … interests of the United States.83<br/>Regarding international finance, the balance between the constraining and enabling properties of rules and institutions is even more favorable to the United States, and there is little evidence of general legitimacy costs. The United States retains a privileged position of influence within the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. An example of how the scope of these institutions can expand under the radar screen of most legitimacy scholarship is International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID)—the major dispute settlement mechanism for investment treaties. Part of theWorld Bank group of institutions, it was established in 1966, and by 1991 it had considered only 26 disputes. With the dramatic growth in investment treaties in the 1990s, however, the ICSID came into its own. Between 1998 and 2004, over 121 disputes were registered with the Center.84 This increase reflects the rapidly growing scope of international investment law. And these new rules and treaties overwhelmingly serve to protect investors’ rights, in which the United States has a powerful interest given how much it invests overseas.<br/>Looking beyond the economic realm, … pursued compensating strategies more energetically.</p><p>Legitimacy is inevitable and isn’t key to cooperation anyway<br/>Wohlforth 9 — Daniel Webster Professor of Government, &nbsp;Dartmouth. &nbsp;BA in IR, MA in IR and MPhil and PhD in &nbsp;pol sci, Yale (William and Stephen Brooks, Reshaping the World Order, March / April 2009, Foreign Affairs Vol. 88, Iss. 2; pg. 49, 15 pgs)<br/>FOR ANALYSTS such as Zbigniew … reform of the international system.&nbsp;</p><p>NSA scandals destroy US ability to exert soft power <br/>Migranyan 7/5 (Andranik, director of the Institute for Democracy and Cooperation in New York and professor at the Institute of International Relations in Moscow, a former member of the Public Chamber and a former member of the Russian Presidential Council. “Scandals Harm U.S. Soft Power,” 2013, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/scandals-harm-us-soft-power-8695)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/scandals-harm-us-soft-power-8695)%27" tppabs="http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/scandals-harm-us-soft-power-8695)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/scandals-harm-us-soft-power-8695)</span></a></span></p><p>For the past few months, … governance—with a more critical eye.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p><strong>*2NC</strong>*</p><p>US will always deter China---even if they acted it would only cause a diplomatic fuss<br/>Vu Duc ‘13 "Khanh Vu Duc is a Vietnamese-Canadian lawyer who researches on Vietnamese politics, international relations and international law.

But the argument remains strong that those arsenals did help keep the United States and Soviet Union at peace with each other. Why non-nuclear states are not deterred from fighting nuclear states is an important and open question. But in a time when calls to ban the Bomb are being heard from more and more quarters, we must be clear about precisely what the broad trends toward peace can and cannot tell us. They may tell us nothing about why we have had no World War III, and little about the wisdom of banning the Bomb now.<br/>Regarding the downward trend in … , including to end civil wars.<br/>We would still need to explain how this charmed circle of causes got started, however. And here let me raise another factor, perhaps even less appealing than the “nuclear peace” thesis, at least outside of the United States. That factor is what international relations scholars call hegemony—specifically American hegemony.<br/>A theory that many regard … for liberal democracy remains strong.</p><p>Social science proves—multipolarity supports the natural incentive to seek status by fighting<br/>Wohlforth, 09 – professor of government at Dartmouth (William, “Unipolarity, Status Competition, and Great Power War,” World Affairs, January, project muse)<br/>The upshot is a near scholarly consensus that unpolarity’s consequences for great power conflict are indeterminate and that a power shift resulting in a return to bipolarity or multipolarity will not raise the specter of great power war. This article questions the consensus on two counts. First, I show that it depends crucially on a dubious assumption about human motivation. Prominent theories of war are based on the assumption that people are mainly motivated by the instrumental pursuit of tangible ends such as physical security and material prosperity. This is why such theories seem irrelevant to interactions among great powers in an international environment that diminishes the utility of war for the pursuit of such ends. Yet we know thatpeople are motivated by a great many noninstrumental motives, not least by concerns regarding their social status. 3 As John Harsanyi noted, “Apart from economic payoffs, social status (social rank) seems to be the most important incentive and motivating force of social behavior.”4 This proposition rests on much firmer scientific ground now than when Harsanyi expressed it a generation ago, as cumulating research shows thathumans appear to be hardwired for sensitivity to status and that relative standing is a powerful and independent motivator of behavior.5 End Page 29 &nbsp;Second, I question the dominant view that status quo evaluations are relatively independent of the distribution of capabilities. If the status of states depends in some measure on their relative capabilities, and if states derive utility from status, then different distributions of capabilities may affect levels of satisfaction, just as different income distributions may affect levels of status competition in domestic settings. 6 Building on research in psychology and sociology, I argue that even capabilities distributions among major powers foster ambiguous status hierarchies, which generate more dissatisfaction and clashes over the status quo. And the more stratified the distribution of capabilities, the less likely such status competition is. Unipolarity thus generates far fewer incentives than either bipolarity or multipolarity for direct great power positional competition over status. Elites in the other major powers continue to prefer higher status, but in a unipolar system they face comparatively weak incentives to translatethat preference into costly action. And the absence of such incentives matters because social status is a positional good—something whose value depends on how much one has in relation to others.7 “If everyone has high status,” Randall Schweller notes, “no one does.”8 While one actor might increase its status, all cannot simultaneously do so. High status is thus inherently scarce, and competitions for status tend to be zero sum.9</p><p>Type II errors outweigh – Congress voted against entering some of the most important wars that stabilized the current international order, i.e. WWII<br/>Nzelibe and Yoo 13 (Jide Nzelibe, Assistant Professor of Law, Northwestern University Law School, and John Yoo, Professor of Law, University of California at Berkeley School of Law, “Rational War and Constitutional Design,” The Yale Law Journal, Vol. 115, No. 9, 12/8/13)</p><ol><li>FUNCTIONAL PURPOSES OF THE … benefits claimed by its proponents.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>Waxman goes neg, concludes that … of the new security environment<br/>Waxman &nbsp;- their author - 13 – Matthew Waxman, Law Professor at Columbia Law School, "The Most Puzzling Line of the President’s Speech", Lawfare Blog, 9-11, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.lawfareblog.com/2013/09/the-most-puzzling-line-of-the-presidents-speech/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.lawfareblog.com/2013/09/the-most-puzzling-line-of-the-presidents-speech/%27" tppabs="http://www.lawfareblog.com/2013/09/the-most-puzzling-line-of-the-presidents-speech/"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.lawfareblog.com/2013/09/the-most-puzzling-line-of-the-presidents-speech/</span></a></span></p><p>I recently posted my new paper on The Constitutional Power to Threaten War (forthcoming, Yale Law Journal). The basic idea is that existing debate and legal scholarship about constitutional war powers focuses overwhelmingly on the President’s and Congress’s share of power to initiate military engagements. It ignores the allocation of legal power to threaten military force or war, even though threats – to coerce or deter enemies and to reassure allies – is one of the most important ways in which the United States government wields its military might.¶ Here are three issues discussed in the paper that relate to Syria and the President’s relations with Congress, including his request for force authorization. Note as a preliminary matter that although the immediate issue for Congress is whether to authorize a proposed package of attacks on Syria, more generally it is being asked now (or should be asked) to buy into the President’s strategy of enforcing the norm against using chemical weapons with U.S. military power.¶ First, a point about constraints on the President: Whatever one thinks about the President’s constitutional authority to make good on his threat against Syria with military force, I’ve not heard anyone question his authority to have unilaterally issued the threat to begin with – that is, his authority to draw a red line on chemical weapon use and imply that the United States would respond forcefully. Most would agree, though, the President has been politically constrained in what he’s communicated through words and actions to the Syrian government, U.S. allies, and others.¶ Some of that political constraint has probably come from Congress all along, and even if Congress were unlikely to wield formal legislative power to terminate or cut-off funds from a Syria operation that the President might launch on his own, Congress’s influence derives in part from its institutional position to make things difficult for the President, and even from influential members’ ability to speak out publicly in ways that might undermine the credibility of presidential threats. Law helps constitute the processes of political struggles in any area of public policy, but what is special here in the context of deterrent strategy is the added importance of foreign audiences – including adversaries and allies, alike – observing and reacting to those politics, too.<br/>Their Card Ends<br/>Second, while Congress’s political and … is better for communicating that <br/>threat credibly – a legally agile president or a legally constrained one? &nbsp;How does the process of seeking legislative authorization affect how signals are understood by adversaries as well as allies and partners?</p><p>The plan would uniquely decimate … global nuclear war more likely<br/>WAXMAN 2013 - law professor at Columbia Law School, co-chairs the Roger Hertog Program on Law and National Security (Matthew Waxman, “The Constitutional Power to Threaten War,” August 27, 2013, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2316777)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2316777)%27" tppabs="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2316777)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2316777)</span></a></span><br/>As a prescriptive matter, Part II … of presidential threats to escalate.</p><p>This is a neg card <br/>Posner – their author – &nbsp;&nbsp;10 (Eric A.

Torture violates the law. So what happens next? Many people think the answer is straightforward. The agents and the president would face trial, conviction, jail time. The law is the law, and applies to everyone.¶ But there is a tradition of liberal political thought that suggests otherwise. Many of the American founders, influenced by Locke, believed in executive prerogative—the doctrine that the president enjoys the power to do what he believes is necessary to protect the country from threats to its security. The Constitution gives lawmaking authority to Congress, but general laws passed during times of peace cannot anticipate all the contingencies that arise in an emergency, and Congress is ill-equipped to pass new laws after the emergency has begun. If the president does not have discretion to take emergency actions that lack legal authorization or even violate existing laws, he will not be able to protect the nation. But if the president does have discretion to take actions he believes are necessary during an emergency, what prevents him from crowning himself dictator?¶ Benjamin Kleinerman offers a way out of this dilemma. He argues that the president needs the discretionary power to disregard the law during emergencies, but also that actions taken pursuant to this power should not be regarded as within his legal power. The president may use his “extra-constitutional” authority to take such actions if they are necessary to protect the nation; the actions must be taken during “extraordinary” rather than ordinary times, and they must not reflect the president’s personal views about what is morally important or politically expedient. If the president does not satisfy these conditions, the public must pressure Congress to impeach him. If he does satisfy them, his actions undergo a kind of constitutional baptism that washes away the taint of illegality.¶ Consider the example of Abraham Lincoln, who is Kleinerman’s hero. In the Emancipation Proclamation, Lincoln confiscated the property of slave owners without congressional authorization or legal process—a clear violation of the law at the time. But the Emancipation Proclamation was a military necessity in the war against the Confederacy. It was not motivated by a moral repugnance of slavery; that is why Lincoln did not emancipate all slaves, such as those in the friendly border states. And because this action took place during extraordinary times, it did not set a precedent that the executive can unilaterally confiscate property whenever it wants to do so. Lincoln acted outside of the Constitution, but because the people ultimately validated his actions, his actions became constitutional. (For unexplained reasons, it was sufficient that Northerners delivered this validation while Southerners remained mute.)¶ Kleinerman lambasts George W. Bush for not following this formula and instead claiming constitutional authority to protect the country using whatever means necessary. But Kleinerman cannot make up his mind about the ill consequences of Bush’s actions. He says that Bush has created dangerous precedents that will allow future executives to engage in abuse, but also that Bush might inspire a legalistic backlash that will prevent future executives from protecting the nation, and even that Bush will have created insufficient discretion for future executives because even Bush’s lawyers acknowledge that certain legal constraints remain. All three cannot be the case. Meanwhile, Lincoln, according to Kleinerman, avoided these bad consequences by acting extra-constitutionally. Lincoln established no legal precedents, while preserving maximal extra-constitutional discretion to address emergencies in the future. But why should it matter whether the precedent is legal or political?¶ To support this argument, Kleinerman makes some tricky assumptions about political psychology. He claims that the public is apathetic about government but fretful about security. If an emergency strikes, people eagerly put their faith in a president who takes a muscular response. If they believe that the president has the legal right to disregard statutes in emergencies, they are likely to acquiesce in an executive response that is unwise and even abusive. If they believe that the president has no such right, so that the president will have to claim extra-constitutional powers to break the law, they will be in a better position to judge the extent to which he upholds constitutional values, so that constitutional structures may be re-established when normal times return. Congress, in turn, can more easily impeach a president who abuses his discretionary power if emergency actions taken by the executive are regarded as extra-constitutional than if they are regarded as legal under the Constitution. ¶ <br/>Their card ends<br/>This is pretty fancy footwork … impeachment or at the polls.</p><p>Plan allows Congress to vocally … destroys international perception of U.S. resolve<br/>Waxman 8/25/13 Matthew Waxman, Professor of Law @ Columbia and Adjunct Senior Fellow for Law and Foreign Policy @ CFR, citing William Howell, Sydney Stein Professor in American Politics @ U-Chicago, and Jon Pevehouse, Professor of Political Science @ U-Wisconsin-Madison, “The Constitutional Power to Threaten War,” Forthcoming in Yale Law Journal, vol. 123, August 25, 2013, SSRN<br/>When members of Congress vocally oppose … &nbsp;involve vital strategic interests.145</p><p>Executive flexibility and ability to … to solve multiple nuclear threats<br/>Li 9 Zheyao, J.D. candidate, Georgetown University Law Center, 2009; B.A., political science and history, Yale University, 2006.

But in a time when calls to ban the Bomb are being heard from more and more quarters, we must be clear about precisely what the broad trends toward peace can and cannot tell us.

These highly visible patrols disrupt trade off China's coast, and result in skyrocketing insurance rates for shipping companies. Several days into the contingency, which involves over ten thousand US military personnel, an intelligence estimate concludes that a Chinese conventional strike against US air patrols and naval assets is imminent. The United States conducts a preemptive strike against anti-air and anti-sea systems on the Chinese mainland. The US strike is far more successful than Chinese military leaders thought possible; a new source of intelligence to the United States—unknown to Chinese leadership—allowed the US military to severely degrade Chinese targeting and situational awareness capabilities. Many of the weapons that China relied on to dissuade escalatory US military action are now reduced to single-digit-percentage readiness. Estimates for repairs and replenishments are stated in terms of weeks, and China's confidence in readily available, but “dumber,” weapons is low due to the dispersion and mobility of US forces. Word of the successful US strike spreads among the Chinese and Taiwanese publics. The Chinese Government concludes that for the sake of preserving its domestic strength, and to signal resolve to the US and Taiwanese Governments while minimizing further economic disruption, it should escalate dramatically with the use of an extremely small-yield nuclear device against a stationary US military asset in the Pacific region.<br/>This short story reflects a future … methodological canon of the discipline.</p><p>Specifically true for nuclear miscalc<br/>Mahnken and Junio 13 – (2013, Thomas, PhD, Jerome E.

The Dangers of judicial Intervention Faced with the prospect that congressional participation can sometimes play a salutary role in avoiding unnecessary wars, an antecedent question naturally arises. Should the courts decide if such a congressional role would be appropriate? Indeed, a recurring theme running through much of the Congress-first literature is that judicial intervention is necessary to vindicate the congressional role in initiating conflicts. But if one accepts the signaling model developed here, there are significant reasons why one ought to be wary of a judicial role in resolving war powers controversies. First, under our model of international crisis bargaining, judicial review would likely undermine the value of signals sent by the President when he seeks legislative authorization to go to war. In other words, it is the fact that the signal is both costly and discretionary that often makes it valuable. Once one understands that regime characteristics can influence the informational value of signaling, it makes sense that the President should have the maximum flexibility to choose less costly signals when dealing with rogue states or terrorist organizations. The alternative- a judicial rule that mandates costly signals in all circumstances, even when such signals have little or no informational value to the foreign adversary-would dilute the overall value of such signals. Second, judicial review would preclude the possibility of beneficial bargaining between the President and Congress by forcing warmaking into a procedural straitjacket. In this picture, judicial review would constrain the political branches to adopt only the tying hands type of signal regardless of the nature or stage of an international crisis. But the supposed restraining effect attributed to the tying hands signal can vary considerably depending on whether the democracy is deciding to initiate an international crisis or is already in the midst of an escalating crisis.

These highly visible patrols disrupt trade off China's coast, and result in skyrocketing insurance rates for shipping companies. Several days into the contingency, which involves over ten thousand US military personnel, an intelligence estimate concludes that a Chinese conventional strike against US air patrols and naval assets is imminent. The United States conducts a preemptive strike against anti-air and anti-sea systems on the Chinese mainland. The US strike is far more successful than Chinese military leaders thought possible; a new source of intelligence to the United States—unknown to Chinese leadership—allowed the US military to severely degrade Chinese targeting and situational awareness capabilities. Many of the weapons that China relied on to dissuade escalatory US military action are now reduced to single-digit-percentage readiness. Estimates for repairs and replenishments are stated in terms of weeks, and China's confidence in readily available, but “dumber,” weapons is low due to the dispersion and mobility of US forces. Word of the successful US strike spreads among the Chinese and Taiwanese publics. The Chinese Government concludes that for the sake of preserving its domestic strength, and to signal resolve to the US and Taiwanese Governments while minimizing further economic disruption, it should escalate dramatically with the use of an extremely small-yield nuclear device against a stationary US military asset in the Pacific region.<br/>This short story reflects a future … methodological canon of the discipline.</p><p>Specifically true for nuclear miscalc<br/>Mahnken and Junio 13 – (2013, Thomas, PhD, Jerome E.

Geopolitical Strategic Considerations Bearing on Judicial Interpretation<br/>Before the United States Supreme Court Justices form an opinion on the legality of national security decisions by the POTUS, they should immerse themselves in judicially-noticeable facts concerning what national security expert, Bruce Berkowitz, in the subtitle of his recent book, calls the "challengers, competitors, and threats to America's future." n23 Not that the Justices need to become experts in national security affairs, n24 but every Supreme Court Justice should be aware of the following five basic national security facts and conceptions before sitting in judgment on presiprudential national security determinations.<br/>(1) "National security policy . . . is … themselves with regional powers." n27<br/>(2) "Yet, as worrisome as these immediate concerns may be, the long-term challenges are even harder to deal with, and the stakes are higher. Whereas the main Cold War threat--the Soviet Union--was brittle, most of the potential adversaries and challengers America now faces are resilient." n28<br/>(3) "The most important task … advantage, they do not." n30<br/>(4) While "keeping the strategic advantage may not have the idealistic ring of making the world safe for democracy and does not sound as decisively macho as maintaining American hegemony," n31 maintaining the American "strategic advantage is critical, because it is essential for just about everything else America hopes to achieve--promoting freedom, protecting the homeland, defending its values, preserving peace, and so on." n32<br/>(5) The United States requires … focus its own resources." n34<br/>&nbsp;*888 &nbsp;As further serious preparation for engaging in the jurisprudence of American national security presiprudence in hotly contested cases and controversies that may end up on their docket, our Supreme Court Justices should understand that, as Walter Russell Mead pointed out in an important essay a few years ago, n35 the average American can be understood as a Jacksonian pragmatist on national security issues. n36 "Americans are determined to keep the world at a distance, while not isolating ourselves from it completely. If we need to take action abroad, we want to do it on our terms." n37 Thus, recent social science survey data paints "a picture of a country whose practical people take a practical approach to knowledge about national security. Americans do not bother with the details most of the time because, for most Americans, the details do not matter most the time." n38 Indeed, since the American people "do know the outlines of the big picture and what we need to worry about in national security affairs so we know when we need to pay greater attention and what is at stake.

The Dangers of judicial Intervention Faced with the prospect that congressional participation can sometimes play a salutary role in avoiding unnecessary wars, an antecedent question naturally arises. Should the courts decide if such a congressional role would be appropriate? Indeed, a recurring theme running through much of the Congress-first literature is that judicial intervention is necessary to vindicate the congressional role in initiating conflicts. But if one accepts the signaling model developed here, there are significant reasons why one ought to be wary of a judicial role in resolving war powers controversies. First, under our model of international crisis bargaining, judicial review would likely undermine the value of signals sent by the President when he seeks legislative authorization to go to war. In other words, it is the fact that the signal is both costly and discretionary that often makes it valuable. Once one understands that regime characteristics can influence the informational value of signaling, it makes sense that the President should have the maximum flexibility to choose less costly signals when dealing with rogue states or terrorist organizations. The alternative- a judicial rule that mandates costly signals in all circumstances, even when such signals have little or no informational value to the foreign adversary-would dilute the overall value of such signals. Second, judicial review would preclude the possibility of beneficial bargaining between the President and Congress by forcing warmaking into a procedural straitjacket. In this picture, judicial review would constrain the political branches to adopt only the tying hands type of signal regardless of the nature or stage of an international crisis. But the supposed restraining effect attributed to the tying hands signal can vary considerably depending on whether the democracy is deciding to initiate an international crisis or is already in the midst of an escalating crisis. Requiring legislative authorization may make it less likely that the democracy will be willing to back out of a conflict once it starts. Thus, tying hand signals and judicial insistence that the President seek legislative authorization will contribute to greater international instability once a conflict has already started.</p><p>That creates unlimited legislative role … the case in the SQ <br/>John Yoo 8, Cal Berkeley law prof, The Powers of War and Peace, 244-9<br/>Non-self-execution provides a ready … , the environment, and human rights.&nbsp;</p><p>Extinction <br/>Michael Panzer 8, 25-year veteran of the markets who has worked for for HSBC, Soros Funds, ABN Amro, Dresdner Bank, and J.P.

Scientists looked at emission plans from 192 nations and calculated what would happen to global warming. The projections take into account 80 percent emission cuts from the U.S. and Europe by 2050, which are not sure things. The U.S. figure is based on a bill that passed the House of Representatives but is running into resistance in the Senate, where debate has been delayed by health care reform efforts. Carbon dioxide, mostly from the burning of fossil fuels such as coal and oil, is the main cause of global warming, trapping the sun's energy in the atmosphere. The world's average temperature has already risen 1.4 degrees since the 19th century. Much of projected rise in temperature is because of developing nations, which aren't talking much about cutting their emissions, scientists said at a United Nations press conference Thursday. China alone adds nearly 2 degrees to the projections. "We are headed toward very serious changes in our planet," said Achim Steiner, head of the U.N.'s environment program, which issued the update on Thursday. The review looked at some 400 peer-reviewed papers on climate over the last three years. &nbsp;Even if the developed world cuts its emissions by 80 percent and the developing world cuts theirs in half by 2050, as some experts propose, the world is still facing a 3-degree increase by the end of the century, said Robert Corell, a prominent U.S. climate scientist who helped oversee the update. &nbsp;Corell said the most likely agreement out of the international climate negotiations in Copenhagen in December still translates into a nearly 5-degree increase in world temperature by the end of the century. European leaders and the Obama White House have set a goal to limit warming to just a couple degrees. &nbsp;The U.N.'s environment program unveiled the update on peer-reviewed climate change science to tell diplomats how hot the planet is getting. The last big report from the Nobel Prize-winning Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change came out more than two years ago and is based on science that is at least three to four years old, Steiner said. &nbsp;Global warming is speeding up, especially in the Arctic, and that means that some top-level science projections from 2007 are already out of date and overly optimistic. Corell, who headed an assessment of warming in the Arctic, said global warming "is accelerating in ways that we are not anticipating." &nbsp;Because Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets are melting far faster than thought, it looks like the seas will rise twice as fast as projected just three years ago, Corell said. He said seas should rise about a foot every 20 to 25 years.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>Prefer our ev – their authors are too short-term and ignore adaptation <br/>Goklany 11 (Indur M., science and technology policy analyst for the US Dept of the Interior, “Misled on Climate Change: How the UN IPCC (and others) Exaggerate the Impacts of Global Warming” December 2011, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://goklany.org/library/Reason20CC20and20Development202011.pdf)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://goklany.org/library/Reason20CC20and20Development202011.pdf)%27" tppabs="http://goklany.org/library/Reason20CC20and20Development202011.pdf)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://goklany.org/library/Reason20CC20and20Development202011.pdf)</span></a></span></p><p>A third approach would be to fix the root cause of why developing countries are deemed to be most at-risk, namely, poverty. Sustained economic growth would, as is evident from the experience of developed countries, address virtually all problems of poverty, not just that portion exacerbated by global warming. It is far more certain that sustainable economic growth will provide greater benefits than emission reductions: while there is no doubt that poverty leads to disease and death, there is substantial doubt regarding the reality and magnitude of the negative impact of global warming. This is especially true as assessments often ignore improvements in adaptive capacity. Of these three approaches, human well-being in poorer countries is likely to be advanced most effectively by sustained economic development and least by emission reductions. In addition, because of the inertia of the climate system, economic development is likely to bear fruit faster than any emission reductions. These figures also indicate that the compound effect of economic development and technological change can result in quite dramatic improvements even over the relatively short period for which these figures were developed. Figure 5, for instance, covered 26 years. By contrast, climate change impacts analyses frequently look 50 to 100 years into the future. Over such long periods, the compounded effect could well be spectacular. Longer term analyses of climate-sensitive indicators of human well-being show that the combination of economic growth and technological change can, over decades, reduce negative impacts on human beings by an order of magnitude, that is, a factor of ten, or more. In some instances, this combination has virtually eliminated such negative impacts. But, since impact assessments generally fail to fully account for increases in economic development and technological change, they substantially overestimate future net damages from global warming. It may be argued that the high levels of economic development depicted in Figure 6 are unlikely. But if that’s the case, then economic growth used to drive the IPCC’s scenarios are equally unlikely, which necessarily means that the estimates of emissions, temperature increases, and impacts and damages of GW projected by the IPCC are also overestimates. B. Secular Technological Change The second major reason why future adaptive capacity has been underestimated (and the impacts of global warming systematically overestimated) is that few impact studies consider secular technological change. 25 Most assume that no new technologies will come on line, although some do assume greater adoption of existing technologies with higher GDP per capita and, much less frequently, a modest generic improvement in productivity. 26 Such an assumption may have been appropriate during the Medieval Warm Period, when the pace of technological change was slow, but nowadays technological change is fast (as indicated in Figures 1 through 5) and, arguably, accelerating. 27 It is unlikely that we will see a halt to technological change unless so-called precautionary policies are instituted that count the costs of technology but ignore its benefits, as some governments have already done for genetically modified crops and various pesticides. So how much of a difference in impact would consideration of both economic development and technological change have made? If impacts were to be estimated for five or so years into the future, ignoring changes in adaptive capacity between now and then probably would not be fatal because neither economic development nor technological change would likely advance substantially during that period. However, the time horizon of climate change impact assessments is often on the order of 35–100 years or more. The Fast Track Assessments use a base year of 1990 to estimate impacts for 2025, 2055 and 2085. Over such periods one ought to expect substantial advances in adaptive capacity due to increases in economic development, technological change and human capital. As already noted, retrospective assessments indicate that over the span of a few decades, changes in economic development and technologies can substantially reduce, if not eliminate, adverse environmental impacts and improve human well-being, as measured by a variety of objective indicators. 41 Thus, not fully accounting for changes in the level of economic development and secular technological change would understate future adaptive capacity, which then could overstate impacts by one or more orders of magnitude if the time horizon is several decades into the future. The assumption that there would be little or no improved or new technologies that would become available between 1990 and 2100 (or 2200), as assumed in most climate change impact assessments, is clearly naïve. In fact, a comparison of today’s world against the world of 1990 (the base year used in most impacts studies to date) shows that even during this brief 20-year span, this assumption is invalid for many, if not most, human enterprises. Since 1990, for example, the portion of the developing world’s population living in absolute poverty declined from 42 to 25, and in sub-Saharan Africa Internet users increased from 0 to 50 million, while cellular phone users went from 0 per 100 to 33 per 100.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>Empirically denied, no solvency because it’s natural, and no impact <br/>Lieberman 7 – Senior Policy Analyst at The Heritage Foundation's Roe Institute for Economic Policy Studies. JD from George Washington. (Ben, 9/11, lexis)<br/>As far as ozone depletion is concerned, the thinning of the ozone layer that occurred throughout the 1980s apparently stopped in the early 1990s, too soon to credit the Montreal Protocol. A 1998 World Meteorological Organization (WMO) report said: "Since 1991, the linear downward trend observed during the 1980s has not continued, but rather total column ozone has been almost constant." However, the same report noted that the stratospheric concentrations of the offending compounds were still increasing through 1998. This lends credence to the skeptical view, widely derided at the time of the Montreal Protocol, that natural variations better explain the fluctuations in the global ozone layer. More importantly, the feared increase in ground level UVB radiation has also failed to materialize. Keep in mind that ozone depletion, in and of itself, doesn't really harm human health or the environment. It was the concern that an eroded ozone layer will allow more of the sun's damaging UVB rays to reach the Earth that led to the Montreal Protocol. But WMO concedes no statistically significant long-term trends have been detected, noting earlier this year that "outside the polar regions, ozone depletion has been relatively small, hence, in many places, increases in UV due to this depletion are difficult to separate from the increases caused by other factors, such as changes in cloud and aerosol." In short, the impact of ozone depletion on UVB over populated regions is so small it's hard to detect. <br/>Needless to say, if UVB hasn't gone up, then the fears of increased UVB-induced harm are unfounded. Indeed, the much-hyped acceleration in skin cancer rates hasn't been documented. U.S. National Cancer Institute statistics show malignant melanoma incidence and mortality, which had been undergoing a long-term increase that predates ozone depletion, has actually been leveling off during the putative ozone crisis. Further, no ecosystem or species was ever shown to be seriously harmed by ozone depletion. This is true even in Antarctica, where the largest seasonal ozone losses, the so-called Antarctic ozone hole, occur annually. Also forgotten is a long list of truly ridiculous claims, such as the one from Al Gore's 1992 book "Earth in the Balance" that, thanks to the Antarctic ozone hole, "hunters now report finding blind rabbits; fisherman catch blind salmon."</p><p>No impact – radiation increase is trivial<br/>Singer, 95 (S.

They have succumbed to tales of blind sheep and rabbits, plankton death, and the disappearance of frogs--all blamed on ozone depletion. Yet a little common sense could help to stem the tide of scare stories, punitive regulations, and politically motivated Nobel prizes. From the very outset it has been clear that the feared global ozone depletion would lead to a trivial increase of ultraviolet radiation at the Earth's surface, equivalent to moving just 60 miles closer to the equator, the distance from Washington to Richmond. This equivalence has been openly acknowledged by ozone scientists in press conferences and Congressional hearings. It puts the lie to fears of cataract epidemics, immune system failures, and various ecological disasters. The problem now is that the action of the Swedish Academy is being viewed as a scientific endorsement, not only of ozone depletion but of all of the horror stories put out by activist groups. Awarding the Nobel prize with the science still unsettled only says that facts are irrelevant, that data don't matter.

What Effect Has the U.S. Constitution Had on the Recently Adopted Constitutions of Other Nations?, 29 May 2013, www.heritage.org/research/lecture/2013/05/model-resource-or-outlier-what-effect-has-the-us-constitution-had-on-the-recently-adopted-constitutions-of-other-nations<br/>Unsurprisingly, attempting to gauge one constitution’s “influence” on another involves various conceptual and methodological challenges. To illustrate, a highly generic constitution may be generic because others have followed its lead, because it has modeled others, or simply by coincidence. That said, if two constitutions are becoming increasingly dissimilar, by definition, one cannot be following the other. That is, neither is exerting influence on the other (at least not in a positive way).<br/>This is the phenomenon we observed in comparing the U.S. Constitution to the rest of the world; based on the rights index, the U.S. has become less similar to the world since 1946 and, with a current index of 0.30, is less similar now than at any point during the studied period. This phenomenon has occurred even among current American allies; among countries in regions with close cultural and historic ties to the U.S. (namely, Latin America and Western Europe); and among democracies. Only among common law countries is constitutional similarity higher than it was after World War II, but even that similarity has decreased since the 1960s.<br/>Rights provisions are not the only constitutional elements that have lost favor with the rest of the world; structural provisions pioneered by American constitutionalism—such as federalism, presidentialism, and judicial review—have also been losing their global appeal.<br/>For instance, in the early 20th century, 22 percent of constitutions provided for federalistic systems, while today, just 12 percent do.<br/>A similar trend has occurred for presidentialism, another American innovation. Since the end of World War II, the percentage of countries employing purely presidential systems has declined, mainly in favor of mixed systems, which were a favorite of former Soviet bloc countries.<br/>Finally, though judicial review is not mentioned in the U.S. Constitution, it has proved the most popular American structural innovation. But though the popularity of judicial review in general has exploded over the past six decades, most countries have opted for the European style of review (which designates a single, constitutional court which alone has the power to nullify laws inconsistent with the constitution) over the American model (in which all courts are empowered to strike unconstitutional laws). In 1946, over 80 percent of countries exercised American-style constitutional review; today, fewer than half do.<br/>Reasons for the Decline<br/>It appears that several factors are driving the U.S. Constitution’s increasing atypicality. First, while in 2006 the average national constitutions contained 34 rights (of the 60 we identify), the U.S. Constitution contains relatively few—just 21—and the rights it does contain are often themselves atypical.<br/>Just one-third of constitutions provide for church and state separation, as does the U.S. Establishment Clause, and only 2 percent of constitutions (including, e.g., Mexico and Guatemala) contain a “right to bear arms.” Conversely, the U.S. Constitution omits some of the most globally popular rights, such as women’s rights, the right to social security, the right to food, and the right to health care.<br/>These peculiarities, together with the fact that the U.S. Constitution is both old and particularly hard to amend, have led some to characterize the Constitution as simply antiquated or obsolete.</p><p>Modeling fails – constitutions must be endogenous<br/>Mila Versteeg 13, Associate Professor at the University of Virginia School of Law.

To the contrary, I tend to resist the notion that constitutional design based on a standardized template is generally desirable. Rather, I adhere to the view that constitutions should be written with popular input and tailored to the needs, traditions, values, and interests of the society they govern. There is no “one-size-fits-all” constitution.<br/>Indeed, history and the literature have documented the adverse effects of foreign values being inserted into a citizenry that is unprepared to accept them.

There have been enormously destructive plagues, such as the Black Death, smallpox, and now AIDS, but none has come close to destroying the entire human race. There is a biological reason. Natural selection favors germs of limited lethality; they are fitter in an evolutionary sense because their genes are more likely to be spread if the germs do not kill their hosts too quickly. The AIDS virus is an example of a lethal virus, wholly natural, that by lying dormant yet infectious in its host for years maximizes its spread. Yet there is no danger that AIDS will destroy the entire human race. The likelihood of a natural pandemic that would cause the extinction of the human race is probably even less today than in the past (except in prehistoric times, when people lived in small, scattered bands, which would have limited the spread of disease), despite wider human contacts that make it more difficult to localize an infectious disease. The reason is improvements in medical science. But the comfort is a small one. Pandemics can still impose enormous losses and resist prevention and cure: the lesson of the AIDS pandemic. And there is always a lust time. That the human race has not yet been destroyed by germs created or made more lethal by modern science, as distinct from completely natural disease agents such as the flu and AIDS viruses, is even less reassuring. We haven't had these products long enough to be able to infer survivability from our experience with them. A recent study suggests that as immunity to smallpox declines because people am no longer being vaccinated against it, monkeypox may evolve into "a successful human pathogen," (9) yet one that vaccination against smallpox would provide at least some protection against; and even before the discovery of the smallpox vaccine, smallpox did not wipe out the human race. What is new is the possibility that science, bypassing evolution, will enable monkeypox to be "juiced up" through gene splicing into a far more lethal pathogen than smallpox ever was.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p><strong>*2NC</strong>*</p><p>SARS proves intervening actors check<br/>Nishiura 05 (H Nishiura Bangkok School of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University,Thailand , K Patanarapelert, M Sriprom, W Sarakorn, S Sriyab , Department of Mathematics, Faculty of Science, Mahidol University and I Ming Tang Institute of Science and Technology for Research and Development, Mahidol University “EVIDENCE BASED PUBLIC HEALTH POLICY AND PRACTICE Modelling potential responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome in Japan: the role of initial attack size, precaution, and quarantine” <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.hawaii.edu/hivandaids/Modelling_Potential_Responses_to_Sev  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.hawaii.edu/hivandaids/Modelling_Potential_Responses_to_Sev%27" tppabs="http://www.hawaii.edu/hivandaids/Modelling_Potential_Responses_to_Sev"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.hawaii.edu/hivandaids/Modelling_Potential_Responses_to_Sev</span></a></span> ere_Acute_Respiratory_Syndrome_in_Japan.pdf August 29, 2005)</p><p>There has been an intensive … workers as was pointed out.</p><p>Countermeasures and basic biology … show how absurd this impact is<br/>Coates 2009 – former adjunct professor at George Washington University, President of the Kanawha Institute for the Study of the Future and was President of the International Association for Impact Assessment and was President of the Association for Science, Technology and Innovation, M.S., Hon D., FWAAS, FAAAS, (Joseph F., Futures 41, 694-705, "Risks and threats to civilization, humankind, and the earth”, ScienceDirect, WEA)</p><p>Could diseases in animals be … effects comprising a threat to stability.</p><p>The IFR supplies enough clean energy to solve warming<br/>Blees et al 11 (Charles Archambeau , Randolph Ware, Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences, Tom Blees, National Center for Atmospheric Research, Barry Brook, Yoon Chang, University of Colorado, Jerry Peterson, Argonne National Laboratory, Robert Serafin Joseph Shuster Tom Wigley, “IFR: An optimized approach to meeting global energy needs (Part I)” 2/1/11) <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://bravenewclimate.com/2011/02/01/ifr-optimized-source-for-global-energy-needs-part-i/)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://bravenewclimate.com/2011/02/01/ifr-optimized-source-for-global-energy-needs-part-i/)%27" tppabs="http://bravenewclimate.com/2011/02/01/ifr-optimized-source-for-global-energy-needs-part-i/)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://bravenewclimate.com/2011/02/01/ifr-optimized-source-for-global-energy-needs-part-i/)</span></a></span><br/>Fossil fuels currently supply about 80 … an important passive safety feature.</p><p>Electricity is the foundational thing to solve to reduce emissions<br/>Brook et al 9 (Barry Brook, Professor of Climate Change University of Adelaide, Tom Blees, George Stanford, nuclear reactor physicist, retired from Argonne National Laboratory, and GLR Cowan, “Response to an Integral Fast Reactor (IFR) critique,” 2/21/9) <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://bravenewclimate.com/2009/02/21/response-to-an-integral-fast-reactor-ifr-critique/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://bravenewclimate.com/2009/02/21/response-to-an-integral-fast-reactor-ifr-critique/%27" tppabs="http://bravenewclimate.com/2009/02/21/response-to-an-integral-fast-reactor-ifr-critique/"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://bravenewclimate.com/2009/02/21/response-to-an-integral-fast-reactor-ifr-critique/</span></a></span><br/>6.

If we need to take action abroad, we want to do it on our terms.”37 Thus, recent social science survey data paints “a picture of a country whose practical people take a practical approach to knowledge about national security. Americans do not bother with the details most of the time because, for most Americans, the details do not matter most the time.”38 Indeed, since the American people “do know the outlines of the big picture and what we need to worry about in national security affairs so we know when we need to pay greater attention and what is at stake.

If those governments are overthrown, their hypothetical successors will surely be much less willing to collaborate with the West, which knows that, if such thing ever happens, the Middle Eastern balance of power would dramatically change, not to mention that the price of oil would skyrocket.<br/>Israel fears a nuclear Iran would mean the end of the Israeli monopoly over nuclear weapons in the region. An Iran armed with nuclear weapons (even if it is ruled by hardline Mahmud Ahmadinejad) would not be foolish enough to attack Israel first because Teheran is well aware of Israel's menacing stockpile of nuclear weapons.<br/>So what the Israeli government … seduce Syria away from Iran.<br/>On the other hand, the West is not afraid of a nuclear Iran per se. One can infer that from their refusal to do anything meaningful to prevent the acquisition of nuclear weapons by States like India, Israel or Pakistan. Rather, the Americans and the Europeans cannot accept a 'Pax Iranica' in the Middle East because Teheran would, de facto, control a zone which contains the world's largest oil reserves, a resource the Western economies have to import because their domestic supplies are not enough to meet their consumption needs.<br/>In case of an Israeli … the middle of a powder keg.</p><p>2<br/>The United States congress should clarify that the first use of drones is only acceptable either in self-defense or in response to an attack by a non-state actor located within a state when that state has consented to the United States’ carrying out targeted killing operations within the state’s borders or that state is unwilling or unable to neutralize such actors.&nbsp;</p><p>Congress affirming legality and declaring the right to use drones in self-defense solves the case and avoids a partisan backlash- there is universal support for drone usage in national security contexts.<br/>Anderson ‘10<br/>Kenneth Anderson, Professor of Law, Washington College of Law, American University, and Research Fellow, The Hoover Institution, Stanford University and Member of its Task Force on National Security and the Law, 3/18/10, Rise of the Drones: Unmanned Systems and the Future of War, digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1002andcontext=pub_disc_cong<br/>• Fourth, Congress has vital … , and very legitimate sovereign state.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>3<br/>Text: The Executive Branch of the United States should assign review of drone operations to the Intelligence Advisory Board to establish their efficacy and justifiability ex post.

The game of favoritism toward Israel has not proven wise for Washington, and soon it will be shown to be an even greater folly.”<br/>“There will be disastrous consequences for U.S.-Saudi relations if the United States vetoes U.N. recognition of a Palestinian state,” huffed Turki.<br/>Turki’s op-ed came about a month after Saudi security consultant Nawaf Obaid ominously declared that Saudi Arabia, angered over American’s “ill-conceived response” to the Arab protests and support for Israel, had brought the “oil for security arrangement” between the countries to an end. Obaid works for Turki at the King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies in Riyadh. Saudi Arabia, he concluded, would “recalibrate the partnership.”<br/>So what’s going on here? … for its main Arab ally.<br/>Turki has often taken an abrasive approach to the US, as has his employee Obaid. In answer to a question about religious persecution of Christians in Saudi Arabia at the Council on Foreign Relations in 2006, Turki parried, choosing instead to suggest that Christians accept Muhammad as a prophet and the Koran as divine. Which means, if you know something about Islam, that they would become Muslims. According to Turki then, Christians should either convert to Islam or shut up.<br/>When the US was discussing drawing down in Iraq, Turki and Obaid struck again, warning the US against a withdrawal: “Since America came into Iraq uninvited, it should not leave Iraq uninvited", Turki told a conference in 2006. Obaid threatened that Saudi Arabia would intervene on the side of the Sunnis should a US withdrawal leave the Shiites on top.<br/>Turki also had no compunction about attacking US policy in Afghanistan as inept.”<br/>The problem is the Saudis … threatened by some Saudi officials.</p><p>Lack of trust irrelevant – they’re totally dependant<br/>David Miller 11, public policy fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, 6-19-<br/>2011, “U.S.-Saudi Arabia Relationship Changes with the Times,” NPR, Lexis.<br/>I don't think, frankly, they … , and to preserve their relationship.&nbsp;</p><p>No oil shocks – newest research.<br/>Kahn 11 Jeremy Kahn, Boston Globe, Crude reality Will a Middle Eastern oil disruption crush the economy?

To be sure, there are few cases of drone strikes involving American citizens such as Anwar al-Awlaki and it would probably not be any great burden in the war on terror to have those instances reviewed by a court. The danger is that this would be the establishment of a dangerous precedent, with judges soon being called upon to approve all drone strikes, whether the targets are American citizens or not. There is already a fair amount of bureaucracy to vet such strikes and minimize collateral damage, which sometimes results in the suspects making an escape before approval to fire a Hellfire missile can be obtained. Introducing judges into the mix would make such operations intolerably slow and unwieldy. If judges were given power to review military or CIA strikes taking place outside the country, where would this trend end? With troops having to read detainees on a foreign battlefield their Miranda rights? With judges having to approve in advance all military plans—including armored offensives and artillery barrages—to make sure they don’t infringe on someone’s civil rights? Such scenarios are not asoutlandish crazy as they sound.

Military decisions are, at heart, political ones, McNeal says, and they are rightly made by the branch of government whose top official, the president, faces voters. (A case in point: Republicans suffered at the ballot box in 2006 and 2008 as a result of the public’s displeasure with the Iraq war.) “If you’re a politician,” McNeal says of a drone court, “this is great. Because you aren’t on the hook for anything.” By and large, federal judges don’t want to be in this position. They worry about damaging the integrity of the bench. Retired Judge James Robertson, who served on the U.S. Appeals Court in Washington, argued in The Washington Post that the Constitution forbids the judiciary from issuing advisory opinions. “Federal courts rule on specific disputes between adversary parties,” he wrote. “They do not make or approve policy; that job is reserved to Congress and the executive.” The FISA court is a different animal, because approving surveillance is related to Fourth Amendment protections on search warrants. Still, Americans don’t have to grant the White House complete latitude to operate its targeted-killing program. Another idea that has marshaled some support is an inspector general empowered to review operations after the fact. If administration officials know that someone else ultimately will be auditing their decisions, Chesney says, that may be enough of a check on their conduct.

If one accepts the criteria for targeting a U.S. citizen set forth in the Attorney General’s speech a year ago, it has several parts: (1) the target is a senior operational leader of al Qaeda or associated forces who is actively engaged in planning to kill Americans, (2) the individual poses an imminent threat to the United States, (3) capture is not feasible; and (4) the operation would be conducted in a manner consistent with applicable law of war principles.10 Starting with the last of these criteria: this one is implicit in every military operation, This includes consideration of, for example, the type of weapon used, and the elimination or minimization of collateral damage. Often, these matters are, and should be, left to the discretion of the military commander in direct control of the operation, along with the time, place and manner of the operation. Even if the overall approval of the operation comes from the President or Secretary of Defense, this particular aspect of it is not something that we should normally seek to micromanage from Washington; likewise, there is also not much to be gained by having a federal judge try to review these details in advance. Next, there are the questions of feasibility of capture and imminence. These really are up-to-the-minute, real time assessments of the type I believe Judge Bates was referring to when he said that courts are “institutionally ill-equipped ‘to assess the nature of battlefield decisions.’”11 Indeed, I have seen feasibility of capture of a particular objective change several times in one night. Nor are these questions ones of a legal nature, by the way. Judges are accustomed to making legal determinations based on a defined, settled set of facts – a picture that has already been painted; not a moving target, which is what we are literally talking about here. These are not one-time-only judgments and we want military and national security officials to continually assess and reassess these two questions up until the last minute before an operation. If these types of continual reassessments must be submitted to a member of the Article III branch of government for evaluation, I &nbsp;believe we compromise our government’s ability to conduct these operations effectively. &nbsp;The costs will outweigh the benefits. &nbsp;In that event, I believe we will also discourage the type of continual reevaluation I’m referring to.</p><p>Drone decisions are made in ticking time bomb situations – the plan causes strikes on leaders to be called off<br/>Bloomberg 13 ("Why a Drone Court Won't Work," February 18, www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-02-18/why-a-drone-court-won-t-work.html<br/>Given the ticking-time-bomb nature of drone strikes, seeking judicial approval for an individual strike is impractical. More likely, a judge would have to sign off on adding an individual to the administration’s “kill list” of targets. To get approval, the administration would be obligated to make a case that the person is an imminent threat and that capture wouldn’t be possible. (It’s unclear whether the protocol would apply to all targeted people or just to U.S. citizens such as Anwar al-Awlaki.)<br/>Such a system would ostensibly have two benefits: increasing the legitimacy of the drone war and placing a check on the executive branch’s power to decide life and death. On closer examination, both advantages prove illusory.<br/>First, few outraged Pakistanis would be assuaged by the distinction of judicial scrutiny, and civil libertarians would point out that the target is never given a chance to make a case before the judge. This lack of an “adversarial setting” for the subject might be defensible in the case of FISA warrants, but the stakes here are far higher than a simple wiretap.<br/>As for the balance of powers, that is where we dive into constitutional hot water. Constitutional scholars agree that the president is sworn to use his “defensive power” to protect the U.S. and its citizens from any serious threat, and nothing in the Constitution gives Congress or the judiciary a right to stay his hand. It also presents a slippery slope: If a judge can call off a drone strike, can he also nix a raid such as the one that killed Osama bin Laden? If the other branches want to scrutinize the president’s national security decisions in this way, they can only do so retrospectively.</p><p>Ex ante review prevents use of drones against senior leadership<br/>DOJ 13 (Department of Justice, "Lawfulness of a Lethal Operation Directed Against a US Citizen Who Is a SEnior Operational Leader of Al-Qa'ida or an Associated Force," msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/msnbc/sections/news/020413_DOJ_White_Paper.pdf)<br/>Finally, the Department notes that under the circumstances described in this papr, there exists no appropriate judicial forum to evaluate these constitutional considerations. It is well established that “matters intimately related to foreign policy and national security are rarely proper subjects for judicial intervention,” Haig v. Agee, 453 US 280, 292 (1981), because such matters “frequently turn on standards that defy the judicial application,” or “involve the exercise of a discretion demonstrably committed to the executive or legislature,” Baker v. Carr, 369 US 186, 211 (1962). Were a court to intervene here, it might be required inappropriately to issue an ex ante commend to the President and officials responsible for operations with respect to their specific tactical judgment to mount a potential lethal operation against a senior operational leader of al-Qa’ida or its associated forces. And judicial enforcement of such orders would require the Court to supervise inherently predictive judgments by the President and his national security advisors as to when and how to use force against a member of an enemy force against which Congress has authorized the use of force.</p><p>Ex ante judicial review prevents necessary and legal drone strikes<br/>Vladeck 13 (Steve, Steve Vladeck is a professor of law and the associate dean for scholarship at American University Washington College of Law. A 2004 graduate of Yale Law School, Steve clerked for Judge Marsha Berzon on the Ninth Circuit and Judge Rosemary Barkett on the Eleventh Circuit. In addition to serving as a senior editor of the Journal of National Security Law and Policy, Steve is also the co-editor of Aspen Publishers’ leading National Security Law and Counterterrorism Law casebooks., "Why a drone Court Won't Work - But (Nominal) Damages Might..."www.lawfareblog.com/2013/02/why-a-drone-court-wont-work/)<br/>In my view, the adversity issue is the deepest legal flaw in “drone court” proposals. But the idea of an ex ante judicial process for signing off on targeted killing operations may also raise some serious separation of powers concerns insofar as such review could directly interfere with the Executive’s ability to carry out ongoing military operations…¶ First, and most significantly, even though I am not a particularly strong defender of unilateral (and indefeasible) presidential war powers, I do think that, if the Constitution protects any such authority on the part of the President (another big “if”), it includes at least some discretion when it comes to the “defensive” war power, i.e., the President’s power to use military force to defend U.S. persons and territory, whether as part of an ongoing international or non-international armed conflict or not. And although the Constitution certainly constrains how the President may use that power, it’s a different issue altogether to suggest that the Constitution might forbid him for acting at all without prior judicial approval–especially in cases where the President otherwise would have the power to use lethal force.¶ This ties together with the related point of just how difficult it would be to actually have meaningful ex ante review in a context in which time is so often of the essence. If, as I have to think is true, many of the opportunities for these kinds of operations are fleeting–and often open and close within a short window–then a requirement of judicial review in all cases might actually prevent the government from otherwise carrying out authority that most would agree it has (at least in the appropriate circumstances). This possibility is exactly why FISA itself was enacted with a pair of emergency provisions (one for specific emergencies; one for the beginning of a declared war), and comparable emergency exceptions in this context would almost necessarily swallow the rule. Indeed, the narrower a definition of imminence that we accept, the more this becomes a problem, since the time frame in which the government could simultaneously demonstrate that a target (1) poses such a threat to the United States; and (2) cannot be captured through less lethal measures will necessarily be a vanishing one. Even if judicial review were possible in that context, it’s hard to imagine that it would produce wise, just, or remotely reliable decisions.</p><p>Too many quickly changing factors, the plan would prevent actually “puling the trigger” with drones<br/>Taylor 13 (Paul, Senior Fellow at the Center for Policy and Research and an alumnus of Seton Hall Law School and the Whitehead School of Diplomacy and International Relations, "TransparentPolicy - National Security Blog by the Center for Policy and Research at Seton Hall University, March 23, &nbsp;transparentpolicy.org/2013/03/former-dod-lawyer-frowns-on-drone-court/)<br/>Johnson also notes that even the determination of the facts is fraught with problems. The first three of Holder’s criteria for the legality of a targeted killing operation, feasibility of capture, imminence of threat, and senior leadership in an enemy organization, are time-sensitive determinations. Feasibility, Johnson notes from personal experience, can change several times in one night. That imminence may change over time is obvious to anyone with a dictionary. And while a target’s position as a senior leader in al-Qaeda is unlikely to change very often, it does on occasion (take the case of Mokhtar Belmokhtar). Requiring a court to determine these facts in advance would also require that the executive would have to notify the court when any change has occurred that might effect that determination. Meanwhile, use of ex post review would allow the court to look at a single point in time, when the executive “pulled the trigger” on the operation, thus crystallizing the facts and obviating this problem.</p><p>Creates additional hurdles that prevents acting quickly on new information<br/>Taylor 13 (Paul, Paul is a Senior Fellow at the Center for Policy and Research and an alumnus of Seton Hall Law School and the Whitehead School of Diplomacy and International Relations., "A FISC For Drones?" TransparentPolicy, &nbsp;February 9, transparentpolicy.org/2013/02/a-fisc-for-drones/<br/>I’m not sure that it does. Names may be placed on the list at any time, conceivably as the result of a time sensitive push within the intelligence community. While I am not an expert in the process of targeting decisions, I think that the executive may need to be able to act quickly on new information that indicates that a subject is targetable. Ex ante review would place an additional hurdle between the decisive intelligence and the operation. Chesney seems to realize this by admitting the need for an “exigent circumstances exemption.” But this exception would itself mean defaulting back to an ex post review.</p><p>Aff kills the drone program – uncertainty and inability to make real time decisions<br/>Johnson 13 (Jeh Charles, Former Pentagon General Counsel, "Keynote address at the Center on National Security at Fordham Law School:," March 18<sub>www.lawfareblog.com/2013/03/jeh-johnson-speech-on-a-drone-court-some-pros-and-cons/)<br/>On the other hand, if the proposal is to include all targeted lethal force off the “hot battlefield,” that is a different matter. &nbsp;In that event, in the current world environment, the judge will have supplanted the senior legal official of a national security agency from a large part of his or her &nbsp;job. &nbsp;To do that conscientiously and effectively, one judge or another on this court should consider getting an office in the Pentagon or other agency, and plan on spending a lot of time there, be continually available, ever vigilant, and have continual, around-the-clock access to secure communications, counterterrorism personnel and executive branch lawyers, to hear presentations, receive intelligence, probe intelligence officers for weaknesses in the intelligence, and ask lots of other questions. This is not something to be done “on the papers,” as they say in court.¶ Next, if the court’s jurisdiction is limited to U.S. citizens, there is the question of exactly what the court is to decide. If one accepts the criteria for targeting a U.S. citizen set forth in the Attorney General’s speech a year ago, it has several parts:¶ (1) the target is a senior operational leader of al Qaeda or associated forces who is actively engaged in planning to kill Americans,¶ (2) the individual poses an imminent threat to the United States,¶ (3) capture is not feasible; and¶ (4) the operation would be conducted in a manner consistent with applicable law of war principles.10¶ Starting with the last of these criteria: this one is implicit in every military operation, This includes consideration of, for example, the type of weapon used, and the elimination or minimization of collateral damage.

These really are up-to-the-minute, real time assessments of the type I believe Judge Bates was referring to when he said that courts are “institutionally ill-equipped ‘to assess the nature of battlefield decisions.’”11 Indeed, I have seen feasibility of capture of a particular objective change several times in one night. Nor are these questions ones of a legal nature, by the way.¶ Judges are accustomed to making legal determinations based on a defined, settled set of facts – a picture that has already been painted; not a moving target, which is what we are literally talking about here. These are not one-time-only judgments and we want military and national security officials to continually assess and reassess these two questions up until the last minute before an operation. If these types of continual reassessments must be submitted to a member of the Article III branch of government for evaluation, I believe we compromise our government’s ability to conduct these operations effectively. The costs will outweigh the benefits. In that event, I believe we will also discourage the type of continual reevaluation I’m referring to.¶ That leaves the question of whether the objective is in fact a senior leader of al Qaeda, plotting to kill Americans. Of those I have identified, this one is actually the simplest and most straight-forward, but it is the only one that could plausibly be referred to a court, in my view. But it is not a question unique to U.S. citizens. Whether an objective is a combatant and part of the congressionally-declared enemy is a question we should ask in every instance. Is it, therefore, really worth submitting to a court?¶ Other considerations:¶ Many like to draw distinctions between on and off a so-called “hot battlefield.” In my view, the distinction is becoming increasingly stale. On the one “hot” battlefield left since 2001, Afghanistan, the U.S. is winding down operations, while al Qaeda has migrated to Yemen and north Africa. Further, I can envision a lot of debate and uncertainty about what constitutes the “hot battlefield?” Is it U.S. boots on the ground? If so, how many? Why should that be the test? What about Libya in 2011, for example? The distinction makes sense for developing policy, but I caution against the development of different legal regimes and standards on this basis.¶ Next, a minor point: the phrase “drone court” is a catchy phrase that fits on the bumper-sticker, but it’s a conceptual misnomer. The activity we are talking about is not limited to unmanned aerial vehicles. Targeted lethal force can be, and is, conducted from a several other types of platforms, including manned aircraft.¶ Then there are the constitutional issues. Again, this depends in large part on the scope of what we are considering. I agree with the analysis of Professors Vladeck and Epps on the subject.12 Article II of the Constitution states that the President “shall” be the Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces. That is his burden and responsibility. He may delegate his war-fighting authority within his chain of command, but he cannot assign part of it away to another branch of government, nor have it taken away by an act of Congress. The Article III problems are just as serious: the judiciary does not exist to issue advisory opinions or offer legal advice to the President; they exist to resolve live cases or controversies.13¶ Many refer to the FISA court by analogy, to say that the FISA court, too, does not resolve cases or controversies between parties; it also authorizes surveillance based on classified, ex parte submissions. But this judicial activity has its roots in the warrant requirement in the Fourth Amendment. What FISA judges do is an extension of what judges do every day ex parte in the domestic law enforcement context when they issue search warrants.14 The idea of judicial authorization of lethal force against an enemy combatant, particularly during armed conflict, has no similar roots in an activity typically performed by the judiciary. To the contrary, the idea is motivated by a desire to rein in the President’s constitutional authority to engage in armed conflict and protect the nation, which is the very reason it has constitutional problems.¶ Next, any requirement to submit certain objectives to a national security court must contain exceptions for the Executive Branch to act on its own in exigent circumstances. Again, is it therefore worth it?¶ Also, beware of creating the wrong set of incentives for those who must conduct these operations. A lawful military objective may include an individual, whether his name or his citizenship are known; it may also include a location (like a terrorist training camp) or an object (like a truck filled with explosives). &nbsp;By creating a separate legal regime with additional requirements for an objective if his name or citizenship becomes known, what disincentives do we create for an operator to know for certain the identity of those likely to be present at a terrorist training camp or behind the wheel of the truck bomb? &nbsp;Or, must the government refrain from an attack on what it knows to be an active and dangerous training camp if an al Qaeda terrorist who might be a U.S. citizen wanders in?</sub></p><p>The aff applies a standard of review akin to that used by a criminal prosecution means that the aff can’t answer any of our “real-time decisionmaking” links that are necessary to effective drone use<br/>Guiora 12 (Amos N. Guiora, Targeted Killing: When Proportionality Gets All Out of Proportion, 45 Case W. Res. J. Int'l L. 235, 240 (2012))<br/>The solution to this search for an actionable guideline is the strict scrutiny standard. What is strict scrutiny, and how is it to be implemented in the context of operational counterterrorism? Why is there a need, if at all, for an additional standard articulating self-defense? The strict scrutiny standard would enable operational engagement of a non-state actor predicated on intelligence information that would meet admissibility standards akin to a court of law. The strict scrutiny test seeks to strike a balance enabling the state to act sooner but subject to significant restrictions.<br/>The ability to act sooner is limited, however, by the requirement that intelligence information must be reliable, viable, valid, and corroborated. The strict scrutiny standard proposes that for states to act as early as possible in order to prevent a possible terrorist attack the information must meet admissibility standards similar to the rules of evidence. The intelligence must be reliable, material, and probative.<br/>*240 The proposal is predicated on the understanding that while states need to engage in operational counterterrorism, mistakes regarding the correct interpretation and analysis of intelligence information can lead to tragic mistakes. Adopting admissibility standards akin to the criminal law minimizes operational error.<br/>Rather than relying on the executive branch making decisions in a “closed world” devoid of oversight and review, the intelligence information justifying the proposed action must be submitted to a court that would ascertain the information's admissibility. The discussion before the court would necessarily be conducted ex parte; however, the process of preparing and submitting available intelligence information to a court would significantly contribute to minimizing operational error that otherwise would occur.</p><p>Judicial review of targeted killings would destroy unit cohesion, cause risk aversion, undermine mission effectiveness, and disclose key intel sources---all of those destroy effective drone ops <br/>Larry Maher 10, Quartermaster General, Veterans of Foreign Wars, et al, 9/30/10, BRIEF OF THE VETERANS OF FOREIGN WARS OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE IN SUPPORT OF DEFENDANTS AND DISMISSAL, Nasser al-Aulaqi, Plaintiff, vs. Barack H.

Such judicial interference with the Executive Branch and its constitutional war powers has dangerous implications for national security and our armed forces. Litigation over combat activities would undermine unit cohesion, the core of combat effectiveness at the small unit level. Judicial scrutiny of combat decision making—including strategic, operational and tactical decisions—would induce risk aversion and second-guessing among America’s military leaders, degrading their effectiveness. And, in the sensitive field of special operations, cases such as this may compromise the sources and methods used by America’s elite warriors, potentially threatening both their mission and their safety. Because of the importance of these issues, and the serious threat that this suit and similar litigation pose to national defense, the VFW is submitting this amicus curiae brief in order to share with the Court its perspective on the reasons why this action should be dismissed for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.<br/>SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT<br/>The VFW agrees with the Government’s arguments regarding why this suit is barred, including by the political question doctrine. Rather than repeating those arguments, this amicus brief seeks to add perspective to the reasons why suits like the present action would threaten national security by interfering with ongoing military operations. Allowing this case to proceed would contravene the core military principle of “unity of command,” and undermine the military’s chain of command, creating uncertainty for subordinate leaders and soldiers. Such litigation also would adversely affect unit cohesion, the glue which binds small units together in the heat of battle, and enables them to survive and accomplish their missions. Further, litigation of cases such as this would undermine battlefield decisionmaking by subjecting tactical, operational and strategic decisions to second-guessing by courts far removed from the battlefield. And, to the extent this case will involve the activities of special operations forces, the VFW urges the Court to tread with particular caution, because of the need to protect the extremely sensitive sources and methods utilized by our nation’s elite forces.</p><p>Physicists conclude that it’s easy, material is available – terrorist weapons don’t require the same high standards that make regular weapons so complex<br/>Zimmerman and Pluta 06 – (2006, Peter, PhD, experimental nuclear and elementary particle physics, Emeritus Professor of Science and Security at King's College London, former Chief Scientist of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Anna, researcher, Center for Science and Security at King's College London, PhD candidate, “Nuclear terrorism: A disheartening dissent,” Survival: Global Politics and Strategy Volume 48, Issue 2, 2006, taylor and francis)<br/>It seems certain that at some price nuclear explosive material is available to well funded terrorists, even if there have been no documented incidents in which nuclear explosive material has been sold in useful quantities. With access to fissile materials, in particular HEU or reasonably clean Pu-239, many authors have claimed that improvised nuclear devices29 are comparatively easy to build.30 The principal physicists who are exponents of the ‘easy-to-build’ idea are Theodore B. Taylor, a former fission-weapons designer at Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, and Nobel Laureate Luis Alvarez. Alvarez notably suggested that a nuclear explosion could result if one appropriately sized and shaped piece of U-235 metal were dropped on a second properly sized and shaped piece;31 Taylor, in John McPhee's The Curve of Binding Energy, claimed that, given the material, building a bomb is ‘very easy. Double underlined. Very easy’.32 It is likely that both experts spoke somewhat loosely for effect, because at the time they wrote the official position was that no terrorist could build a nuclear device because constructing a nuclear weapon required an effort on the scale of the Manhattan Project together with a team of scientists of the calibre of those at Los Alamos from 1942 to 1945.<br/>Time has shown that states can go nuclear with smaller projects, and certainly with less brilliant scientists. In part this reduction in required effort and talent is because very large amounts of information about the construction of nuclear weapons as well as the fast-reactor physics needed to compute the behaviour of nuclear devices have become public. This publication sometimes occurred deliberately, as in the historic 1954 Atoms for Peaceconference or the 1970s-era International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluationstudy. Sometimes the information oozed out, as in the McPhee book, and sometimes it was effectively re-invented.33 Many details can now be found in the physics literature.34<br/>There are crucial differences between nuclear weapons built by a state for use in a military stockpile and devices constructed by groups for use in single dramatic acts of terror. A military device must be reliable(it must explode when detonated); it must be predictable(the yield attained must be substantially the same across a complete production run of weapons so that troops using the weapons can choose the one which will best do the job); and it must be safe(a military weapon must be safe to handle and not detonate in common accidents; above all it must not detonate with nuclear yield when the detonation has not been authorised).<br/>A bomb built by a terrorist need not be especially reliable, and it certainly need not be particularly predictable. That is, any yield falling somewhere between 100 tonnes (0.1kt) and 20,000 tonnes (ZOkt) of TNT will almost certainly be considered adequate by the terror group concerned. Surely the strike group would prefer a larger yield to a smaller one, all things being equal; but a 100-tonne explosion will be very nearly as effective as a tool of terror as a 20kt one. Most importantly, it will be perceived as nuclear, and it will contaminate a very large area with radioactive fallout (some, of course, being the unfissioned nuclear material itself). We assume that the terror cell will be concerned with its own safety while assembling the device and transporting it to target, but we do not believe that any terrorist group would or even could attempt to reach the safety levels demanded of an American weapon 35<br/>In 1977 the US Congress's Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) studied nuclear proliferation and safeguards. In its report the OTA panel concluded that an appropriate technical team for building an improvised nuclear device was two people, one of whom was a skilled machinist and the other a physicist.36 If the fissile fuel for the device is uranium enriched to 50 or more, this is a plausible, if stressing, scenario that has been explored in some detail in fiction.37</p><p>Only requires 19 people and 1 year – physics is easy and the barriers are vastly exaggerated.<br/>Zimmerman and Lewis 06 – (10/10, Peter, PhD, experimental nuclear and elementary particle physics, Emeritus Professor of Science and Security at King's College London, former Chief Scientist of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Jeffrey, Director, Nuclear Strategy and Nonproliferation Initiative, New America Foundation, former Executive Director, Project on Managing the Atom/Science, Technology, and Public Policy Program, Belfer Center, Harvard University, “The Bomb in the Backyard,” Foreign Policy, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2006/10/10/the_bomb_in_the_backyard?page=0  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2006/10/10/the_bomb_in_the_backyard?page=0%27" tppabs="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2006/10/10/the_bomb_in_the_backyard?page=0"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2006/10/10/the_bomb_in_the_backyard?page=0</span></a></span>,1)</p><p>The constraint we have placed on our would-be bomb-makers is a total of 19 persons -- the same number of hijackers who orchestrated the September 11 attacks -- working over the course of a year in the United States. We estimate that a three-person physics team, including a relatively senior physicist and two postdoctoral students, would be capable of rendering the design in three to six months. Their salaries during the course of a year would total approximately $200,000. In addition to the physics team, the project could comprise a few small engineering teams to address the following: casting the uranium for the device, constructing the proper gun, assembling the supercritical mass of uranium, overseeing the electronics, and finally, the actual detonation.<br/>In many respects, the most difficult task for nuclear terrorists would be casting the uranium metal, which melts at high temperatures, into appropriate shapes. The metallurgy team would include at least one person with experience in advanced casting techniques. A vacuum furnace is probably required to reduce oxygen contamination and prevent the uranium from igniting. The team would likely need to practice using either natural uranium or some surrogate before casting the final core. The group could find the vacuum furnace to fit their specifications by searching on the Internet, and could probably purchase it for less than $50,000.<br/>The actual pit -- or core of the weapon containing the highly enriched uranium -- could be fabricated quickly. When China built its first nuclear bomb in 1964, a single technician named Yuan Gongfu used a lathe to shape the highly enriched uranium in just one night. New or used lathes large enough to properly finish the roughly cast pit can be bought on the Internet, even on eBay, for $10,000. These instruments are probably as capable as the one Yuan used more than 40 years ago. Computer-controlled machine tools are not necessary. Our terrorist outfit could probably find all the standard machine shop equipment it would need in any university physics department. None of the tools requires special licenses to purchase.<br/>The machining group would also have the task of designing and building the required structure for the device and assembling the whole. This requires at least two or three people able to carry out such common laboratory tasks as welding, brazing, and hard soldering. One member of the group should bring the skills of a draftsman, and preferably good abilities to use computers to design complex shapes.<br/>To detonate a nuclear bomb, terrorists do not need to fashion the right type of gun. "Team Gun" would likely consist of three or four people, at least one of whom is familiar with the interior ballistics of guns in the appropriate size range. Their principal task would be to find a surplus artillery piece of the correct size and to build a projectile. Such recoilless rifles are widely available in the United States and Canada as military surplus, though they require a license to purchase. A hobbyist could easily refurbish a recoilless rifle for just a few thousand dollars. In all likelihood, the gun team would want to test-fire the gun with a dummy nuclear projectile to verify its actual speed. One or two shots should suffice. Barrel life, usually hundreds of shots without maintenance, would not pose a problem. It is unlikely to take more than six months for such a group to adapt and test a reliable gun.<br/>Meanwhile, the electronics team would likely include one or two technicians and probably be headed by an engineer with at least a baccalaureate degree in electrical engineering or experimental physics. Its principal job would be to design the circuitry that arms and fires the device at the desired point, and which prevents it from detonating accidentally. In addition, the group would need to assemble or purchase, install, and calibrate neutron detectors to be used in testing the device.<br/>The terror group will also require a large, remote area for their "mini-Los Alamos." Their biggest concern would be the noise caused by firing the gun during their tests. We would choose a 150-acre ranch in an isolated area -- relatively small compared to the 500,000 acre ranch that Japanese doomsday cult Aum Shinrikyo purchased in Australia. We estimate that such a ranch might be purchased for $150,000 in remote areas of the United States, such as Texas or Wyoming, and require another $50,000 in temporary improvements to build the foundry, machine shop, electronics lab, and other equipment.<br/>Once complete, the nuclear device itself is likely to be less than 9 feet long. Although it would not fit easily in a sedan, it could be transported in a van or small panel truck with, say, a couple drivers and a couple more people to keep an eye on the device. The plotters could target any number of major metropolitan areas and would be free to choose based entirely on their desire to travel unobtrusively and undetected, presumably across a large fraction of the United States. Nevertheless, the transportation phase of the operation would pose significant risks for the terrorists. For the first time, the device would be moved, most likely on public roads, with little security.<br/>The plotters would want to travel on busy roads so as to lose themselves in the traffic stream. In the event that the government became aware of the plot, it would seek to install targeted roadblocks. These checkpoints would force the terrorists to back roads, where they may be likely to attract the attention of local police. The trip would consume no more than 40 driving hours, and could easily be completed in four to five days traveling between dawn and dusk. The cost to deliver the device using a typical rental truck from our hypothetical Wyoming ranch to, say, New York City or Washington, D.C., would be less than $3,000.<br/>At this point, the project would have employed roughly 17 people full time for about one year. Purchasing the necessary items -- from land to supplies, and surplus gun barrels to vacuum casting equipment -- is a specialized business, particularly because the purchases could be traced by law enforcement. The plotters would want to avoid being personally involved in purchasing supplies, so there could be a need for one or two specialists who would be responsible for clandestine procurement. Even so, the entire active team would number no more than 19 people.</p><p>Theft is large scale and ongoing<br/>Bunn 13 – (2013, Matthew, PhD, Professor of Practice; Co-Principal Investigator, Project on Managing the Atom, Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, Harvard, “Beyond Crises: The Unending Challenge of Controlling Nuclear Weapons and Materials,” in Nuclear Weapons Security Crises: What Does History Teach? Ed. Henry D. Sokolski. Strategic Studies Institute, U.S. Army War College, 253-278)</p><p>Theft of highly enriched uranium and plutonium, the essential ingredients of nuclear weapons, is not a hypothetical worry—it is an ongoing reality. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has documented some 18 cases of theft or loss of plutonium or highly enriched uranium (HEU) from 1993-2007 that were confirmed by the states concerned. See Table 1.1 (These cases involving real weapons-usable nuclear material are only one small part of the broader phenomenon of illicit trafficking of nuclear and radioactive materials; the IAEA has reported hundreds of situations involving other materials.) Three of these cases (New Jersey, in 2005; Fukui, Japan, in 2005; and Hennigsdorf, Germany, in 2006) involve inadvertent loss, leaving 15 involving instances of intentional theft and smuggling. Of those, five involve less than a gram of material, and are included here only because of the possibility that these are samples of larger stocks available to the smugglers—as smugglers often claim is the case.<br/>Unfortunately, after 2008, the IAEA stopped issuing public updates of this list of HEU and plutonium incidents. This does not mean, however, that incidents stopped occurring. The Georgian government has confirmed that in March 2010, Georgian agents seized approximately 18 grams of HEU just below 90-percent enrichment from smugglers who crossed into Georgia from Armenia. The smugglers reportedly claimed that more was available.2 In June 2011, authorities in Moldova arrested six people who reportedly had 4.4 grams of weapons-grade HEU. The smugglers claimed to have access to nine kilograms of HEU, which they were willing to sell for $31 million. Moldovan officials report that “members of the ring, who have not yet been detained, have one kilogram of uranium.” This case appears to involve a real buyer–still at large–and the possibility that there are kilograms of weapongrade HEU in the smugglers’ hands, making it potentially the most serious case in years.3<br/>In addition to these cases confirmed to the IAEA, there is strong evidence that a number of additional thefts have occurred—including confessions and convictions for some of the perpetrators—which the states concerned have not confirmed to the IAEA. In particular, there was a well-documented theft of 1.5 kilograms of 90-percent-enriched HEU in 1992 (described in detail below), and two thefts from Russian naval facilities in 1993 that are not included in the IAEA database. Thus, there appear to be approximately 20 well-documented cases of actual theft and smuggling of plutonium or HEU in the public record.4 At the classified level, the U.S. Government regards a significant number of additional cases as confirmed.<br/>To these cases of actual theft and smuggling of plutonium and HEU must be added a substantial number of attempts, attacks, and intrusions that have taken place over the years. These include, among others: the still-unexplained apparent loss of hundreds of kilograms of HEU at the Nuclear Materials and Equipment Corporation (NUMEC) in the mid-1960s (which the balance of the evidence suggests was a theft by senior facility officials on behalf of Israel);5 a 1982 incident in which an insider at the Koeberg nuclear power plant in South Africa planted and detonated explosives on the steel pressure vessel (before fuel had been loaded, intended only to raise alarm, not to spread radioactivity);6 incidents in 2001 in which terrorist teams carried out reconnaissance at Russian nuclear weapons storage sites, and apparently also on nuclear weapon transport trains;7 and a 2007 intrusion in South Africa in which two teams of armed men attacked the Pelindaba site, where hundreds of kilograms of HEU are stored (with one of the teams penetrating a 10,000 volt security fence, disabling intrusion detectors, going to the emergency control center and shooting a worker there after a struggle, and departing without ever being engaged by site security forces).8</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>Delivery into the US is impossible to stop – too many border crossings<br/>Bunn and Wier 06 (Matthew Bunn and Anthony Wier, on the staff of the Managing the Atom Project at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government, are the coauthors of Securing the Bomb: An Agenda for Action (2004). &nbsp;“The Seven Myths of Nuclear Terrorism,” Harvard Belfer Center, available for download here: <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/658/seven_myths_of_nuclear_terrorism.html)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/658/seven_myths_of_nuclear_terrorism.html)%27" tppabs="http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/658/seven_myths_of_nuclear_terrorism.html)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/658/seven_myths_of_nuclear_terrorism.html)</span></a></span></p><p>While some investment in improving border detection capabilities is certainly worthwhile, this last line of defense will always be a very porous one. The physics of nuclear materials and nuclear weapons, the geography of the huge and complex American borders, and the economics of the global flow of people and goods conspire to make the terrorists’ job easy and the defenders’ job very difficult. Once stolen, the nuclear material for a bomb could be any- where, and it is very difficult to detect, especially if shielding is used to limit radiation emissions. &nbsp;Typical nuclear weapons are not large, and could readily be smuggled across America’s or other nations’ borders. The nuclear material needed for a bomb could easily fit in a suitcase. Even an assembled bomb could fit in a van, a cargo container, or a yacht sailed into a US harbor. Or the materials could be smuggled in and the bomb built at the site of its intended use. Terrorists have routinely used truck bombs that were physically larger than even a crude terrorist nuclear bomb would need to be. America’s borders stretch for thousands of miles, and millions of trucks, trains, ships, and airplanes in which nuclear material might be hidden cross them every year. Hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants and thousands of tons of illegal drugs cross US borders every year, despite billions of dollars of investment in trying to stop them. (Some have said that the easiest way to bring nuclear material into the United States would be to hide it in a bale of marijuana.) Every nation’s border is vulnerable to various types of illicit movement, be it drugs, terrorists, or the material needed to unleash nuclear terror. The radiation from plutonium, and especially from HEU, is weak and difficult to detect at any significant distance, particularly if the material is surrounded with shielding. Technology does exist, and is being further developed, to make it possible to detect HEU or plutonium in objects right in front of the detectors (as might be possible at controlled border crossings), including finding hidden nuclear material in everything from airline baggage to cargo containers. Programs are now under way to put these kinds of detection capabilities into place at an increasing number of sites. &nbsp;But these capabilities should not be exaggerated. While US Customs officers have been equipped with “radiation pagers,” these would have essentially no chance of detecting HEU with even minor shielding, even if it were in a bag directly in front of the inspector. More sophisticated equipment that can detect both HEU and plutonium is being purchased—but it will be years before such equipment is installed and in use at all the major ports and border crossings into the United States. Two points are crucial to understand. First, inspecting cargo as it arrives in the United States is not good enough: if a bomb were on a boat sailing into a major US harbor, it could wreak horrible devastation before the ship ever pulled up to the dock to be inspected. That is why many of the new initiatives after the 9-11 attacks involve putting detectors in place at foreign ports that ship to the United States. But it will take an immense and continuing effort to ensure that detection at these ports is effective, that there are no ready possibilities for bribing a customs official to let a container through uninspected and that already inspected containers cannot be tampered with. Second, and more fundamentally, the number of possible pathways to smuggle a nuclear bomb or its ingredients into the United States is immense, and intelligent adversaries will choose whichever pathway remains undefended. If an effective system were put in place to make it very difficult to get nuclear material into the country in a cargo container without detection—and the country is a long way from that point today—then terrorists would bring their bomb in on a yacht, a fishing boat, or by some other means.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p><strong>*1NR</strong>*<br/>More ev they’ll hold off --- … hawks can’t admit it publicly <br/>Dreyfuss 9-13 (Bob,- foreign policy and defense writer for The Nation magazine “Did the Israel Lobby Agree to Hold Off on New Iran Sanctions?”)<br/>In other words, he understands it—… talk to top administration brass.&nbsp;</p><p>Congress is holding off --- but capital is key <br/>Bidwell 11-12 (Christopher,- senior fellow for nonproliferation law and policy at the Federation of American Scientists “Iran is negotiating with the wrong US officials”)<br/>So where does Congress stand … tougher sanction laws may ensue.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Obama push is working --- they’ll hold off now but it’s close <br/>Gray 11-11 (Rosie,- reporter for BuzzFeed Politics “White House Applies Presidential Pressure On Iran Skeptic”)<br/>WASHINGTON — The president and vice … brought us to this point.”</p><p>Senate is holding off now <br/>CSM 9-14 (Christian Science Monitor,- “Iran nuclear deal: If Congress plays bad cop, will that help diplomacy?”)<br/>A growing number of senators … Nations Security Council plus Germany. <br/> <br/>capital<br/>Yes Political Capital</p><p>Milbank 10-18 (Dana,- politics writer for the Washington Post “Now, lead from the front”)<br/>The gloating was a bit unseemly, but the president is entitled to savor a victory lap.

Pa. L. Rev. 1165<br/>Capitalizing on the strategic benefits … killings outside the conflict zone.<br/>Their Card Starts<br/>Legal scholars, policymakers, and state actors are embroiled in a heated debate about whether the conflict with al Qaeda is concentrated within specific geographic boundaries or extends to wherever al Qaeda members and associated forces may go. The United States' expansive view of the conflict, coupled with its broad definition of the enemy, has led to a legitimate concern about the creep of war. Conversely, the European and human rights view, which confines the conflict to a limited geographic region, ignores the potentially global nature of the threat and unduly constrains the state's ability to respond. Neither the law of international armed conflict (governing conflicts between states) nor the law of noninternational armed conflict (traditionally understood to govern intrastate conflicts) provides the answers that are so desperately needed.<br/>The zone approach proposed by this Article fills the international law gap, effectively mediating the multifaceted liberty and security interests at stake. It recognizes the broad sweep of the conflict, but distinguishes between zones of active hostilities and other areas in determining which rules apply. Specifically, it offers a set of standards that would both limit and legitimize the use of out-of-battlefield targeted killings and law of war-based detentions, subjecting their use to an individualized threat assessment, a least-harmful-means test, and significant procedural safeguards. This *1234 approach confines the use of out-of-battlefield targeted killings and detention without charge to extraordinary situations in which the security of the state so demands. It thus limits the use of force as a first resort, protects against the unnecessary erosion of peacetime norms and institutions, and safeguards individual liberty. At the same time, the zone approach ensures that the state can effectively respond to grave threats to its security, wherever those threats are based.<br/>The United States has already adopted a number of policies that distinguish between zones of active hostilities and elsewhere, implicitly recognizing the importance of this distinction. By adopting the proposed framework as a matter of law, the United States can begin to set the standards and build an international consensus as to the rules that ought to apply, not only to this conflict, but to future conflicts. The likely reputational, security, and foreign policy gains make acceptance of this framework a worthy endeavor.</p><p>Restricting location for drone strikes unnecessarily hampers counter-terror operations.
