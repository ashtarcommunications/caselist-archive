States have used this tool, secretly or not, throughout history. In recent years, targeted killing has generated new controversy as two states in particular—Israel and the United States—have struggled against opponents embedded in civilian populations. As a matter of express policy, Israel engages in targeted killing of persons it deems members of terrorist organizations involved in attacks on Israel. The United States, less expressly, has adopted a similar policy against al Qaeda—particularly in the border areas of Afghanistan and Pakistan, where the CIA has used unmanned Predator drones to fire Hellfire missiles to kill al Qaeda leaders and affiliates.

But in a candid interview four months later, Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz acknowledged that weapons of mass destruction were simply "the one issue that everyone could agree on." The intelligence community was raising no alarms about the subject when the Bush administration came into office; indeed, the 2001 edition of the community's comprehensive statement on worldwide threats did not even mention the possibility of Iraqi nuclear weapons or any stockpiles of chemical or biological weapons. The administration did not request the (ultimately flawed) October 2002 intelligence estimate on Iraqi unconventional weapons programs that was central to the official case for invasion -- Democrats in Congress did, and only six senators and a handful of representatives bothered to look at it before voting on the war, according to staff members who kept custody of the copies. Neither Bush nor Condoleezza Rice, then his national security advisor, read the entire estimate at the time, and in any case the public relations rollout of the war was already under way before the document was written.

Zakheim is a former official of the United States government. Born December 18, 1948 in Brooklyn, New York, Zakheim earned his bachelor's degree in government from Columbia University in 1970, and his doctorate in economics and politics at St. Antony's College, Oxford University. He has been an adjunct professor at the National War College, Yeshiva University, Columbia University and Trinity College, where he was presidential scholar. He served in various Department of Defense posts during the Reagan administration, including Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Planning and Resources from 1985 to 1987. There was some controversy in both the US and Israel over Zakheim's involvement in ending the Israeli fighter program, the IAI Lavi. He argued that Israeli and U.S. interests would be best served by having Israel purchase F-16 fighters, rather than investing in an entirely new aircraft.</p><p>American reliability was already … be very long in coming.&nbsp;</p><p>Congress isn’t better at selecting wars or deterring adventurism – empirically proven<br/>Jide Nzelibe 6, Asst.

Like a single spacecraft, the Earth can no longer afford to have a 'crew' divided into two parts: the rich, privileged, wellfed, well-educated, on the one hand, and the poor, deprived, starving, sick and uneducated, on the other. Dangerous 'zero-sum-games' (which mostly prove to be “negative-sum-games”) can hardly be played any more by visible or invisible wars in the world society. Because of global interdependencies, the apparent winner becomes also a loser. The real choice for the world society is between negative- and positive-sum-games: i.e. between, on the one hand, continuation of visible and “invisible wars”, as long as this is possible at all, and, on the other, transformation of the world order by demilitarisation and democratization. No ideological or terminological camouflage can conceal this real dilemma any more, which is to be faced not in the distant future, by the next generations, but in the coming years, because of global terrorism soon having nuclear and other mass destructive weapons, and also due to irreversible changes in natural environment.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>Utilitarianism = Racism</p><p>Rhetoric of utilitarian good occludes the cognitive biases that render objective calculation impossible – only those who can be measured against our own lives are considered <br/>Mignolo 07 (Walter, argentinian semiotician and prof at Duke, “The De-Colonial Option and the Meaning of Identity in Politics” online)</p><p>The rhetoric of …of human lives; that is, according to a racist classification.5</p><p>Framework Stuff</p><p>Concludes neg – their reading of the Owen evidence relies on a conflation of theory and picture that Owen critiques later in the article – understanding ontology in terms of “being-in-the-world” is distinct from debates over which formal theory like realism best describes the ontological character of states – interrogating the formar is logically prior to policies and theories which means Owen agrees with our sequencing args on framework.<br/>Owen, 2AC Author, 02 – (2002, David, Reader of Political Theory, University of Southampton, “Re-orienting International Relations: On Pragmatism, Pluralism and Practical Reasoning,” Millennium Vol 31 No 3 2002 p. 653-73, sage)</p><p>It should be noted that I am not …seeks to address and so, also, mistakes postmodern IR theory for a directly competing theoretical stance which can, in principle, be assimilated to its own research programme.</p><p>Alt Stuff</p><p>The 2AC has conceded a structuring claim about the world – technological enframing structures our perception of reality – alternate modes of revealing are foreclosed and technology is made to seem inevitable and necessary – destructively breaking the vicious cycle constitutes positive change toward sustainability – that’s Joronen</p><p>Passive non-violence is political praxis – “letting be” has historically produced effective and non-manipulative forms of political action around the world<br/>Joronen 11 – (2011, Mikko, PhD, Department of Geography, University of Turku, “Dwelling in the Sites of Finitude: Resisting the Violence of the Metaphysical Globe,” Antipode Volume 43, Issue 4, pages 1127–1154, September 2011, wiley)</p><p>In spite of …limitedness and finitude (see also Irwin 2008:170, 188–189).</p><p>The falsity of security is its largest vulnerability – negativity and dissent can crack open fissures in security logic and break its domination at the level of individual subjects<br/>Burke 02 (Anthony, School of Political Science and International Studies, University of Queensland, Alternatives: Global, Local, Political 27.1)</p><p>It is perhaps easy to become despondent, but as countless struggles for freedom, justice, and social transformation have proved, a sense of seriousness can be tempered with the knowledge that many tools are …possibilities might be.</p><p>Aff can’t solve terrorism</p><p>Even if they win they have a empirical defense of terrorism as a threat – they DON’T have anything remotely sufficient to prove they solve<br/>Matthews 13 (Dylan Matthews covers taxes, poverty, campaign finance, higher education, and all things data.

To couch it in the terms of the aporetic logic that animates it, the phantasm-event comes into being at the surface that is also its depth.

Building on the guidelines proposed by Wohlstetter (1964, 1968) and Elmore (1985) for the making of sound policy, namely, to see the world through the lens of the other so as to anticipate what others might conclude and do, the book critiques the very notion of hegemony.
