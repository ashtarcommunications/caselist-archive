Not toys or models, but real flying machines.<br/>It’s a classic and common phase in the life cycle of a military innovation: <br/>AND<br/>the United States; it’s a precedent Washington does not want anyone following.<br/>America, the world’s leading democracy and a country built on a legal and moral framework unlike any other, has adopted a war-making process that too often bypasses its traditional, regimented, and rigorously overseen military in favor of a secret program never publicly discussed, based on legal advice never properly vetted. The Obama administration has used its executive power to refuse or outright ignore requests by congressional overseers, and it has resisted monitoring by federal courts.<br/>To implement this covert program, the administration has adopted a tool that lowers the <br/>AND<br/>-states involved but also destabilize entire regions and potentially upset geopolitical order.<br/>Hyperbole? Consider this: Iran, with the approval of Damascus, carries out <br/>AND<br/>learned it by watching you. In Pakistan, Yemen, and Afghanistan.<br/>This is the unintended consequence of American drone warfare. For all of the attention <br/>AND<br/>uses of one of the most awesome military robotics capabilities of this generation.<br/>THE WRONG QUESTION <br/>The United States is the indisputable leader in drone technology and long-range strike<br/>AND<br/>billions of dollars that have gone into establishing and maintaining such a capability.<br/>That level of superiority leads some national security officials to downplay concerns about other nations’ <br/>AND<br/>the unparalleled intelligence-collection and data-analysis underpinning the aircraft’s mission.<br/>"There is what I think is just an unconstrained focus on a tool as <br/>AND<br/>who are interpreting the information that’s coming off the sensors on the aircraft."<br/>The analysts are part of the global architecture that makes precision strikes, and targeted <br/>AND<br/>) outweigh the reward (judged by the value of the threat eliminated).<br/>"Is that a shovel or a rifle? Is that a Taliban member or <br/>AND<br/>. We can orbit long enough to be pretty sure about our target."<br/>Other countries, groups, and even individuals can and do fly drones. But no state or group has nearly the sophisticated network of intelligence and data analysis that gives the United States its strategic advantage. Although it would be foolish to dismiss the notion that potential U.S. adversaries aspire to attain that type of war-from-afar, pinpoint-strike capability, they have neither the income nor the perceived need to do so.<br/>That’s true, at least today. It’s also irrelevant. Others who employ drones are likely to carry a different agenda, one more concerned with employing a relatively inexpensive and ruthlessly efficient tool to dispatch an enemy close at hand.<br/>"It would be very difficult for them to create the global-strike architecture <br/>AND<br/>long-duration surveillance and potentially strike inside and right on its border."<br/>And that’s a NATO ally seeking the capability to conduct missions that would run afoul <br/>AND<br/>uses the aircraft to strike Lashkar-e-Taiba militants near Kashmir?<br/>"We don’t like other states using lethal force outside their borders. It’s destabilizing. It can lead to a sort of wider escalation of violence between two states," said Micah Zenko, a security policy and drone expert at the Council on Foreign Relations. "So the proliferation of drones is not just about the protection of the United States. It’s primarily about the likelihood that other states will increasingly use lethal force outside of their borders."<br/>LOWERING THE BAR<br/>Governments have covertly killed for ages, whether they maintained an official hit list or <br/>AND<br/>American security experts point to Russia as well, although Moscow disputes this.<br/>In the 1960s, the U.S. government was involved to differing levels <br/>AND<br/>late as 2001, Washington’s stated policy was to oppose Israel’s targeted killings.)<br/>When America adopted targeted killing again—first under the Bush administration after the September 11 attacks and then expanded by President Obama—the tools of the trade had changed. No longer was the CIA sending poison, pistols, and toxic cigars to assets overseas to kill enemy leaders. Now it could target people throughout al-Qaida’s hierarchy with accuracy, deliver lethal ordnance literally around the world, and watch the mission’s completion in real time.<br/>The United States is smartly using technology to improve combat efficacy, and to make <br/>AND<br/>, defense hawks and spendthrifts alike would criticize it if it did not.<br/>"If you believe that these folks are legitimate terrorists who are committing acts of <br/>AND<br/>Do we have the debate if an aircraft pilot drops a particular bomb?"<br/>But defense analysts argue—and military officials concede—there is a qualitative difference <br/>AND<br/>States would not have pursued an equivalent number of manned strikes in Pakistan.<br/>And what’s true for the United States will be true as well for other countries that own and arm remote piloted aircraft.<br/>"The drones—the responsiveness, the persistence, and without putting your personnel at risk—is what makes it a different technology," Zenko said. "When other states have this technology, if they follow U.S. practice, it will lower the threshold for their uses of lethal force outside their borders. So they will be more likely to conduct targeted killings than they have in the past."<br/>The Obama administration appears to be aware of and concerned about setting precedents through its targeted-strike program. When the development of a disposition matrix to catalog both targets and resources marshaled against the United States was first reported in 2012, officials spoke about it in part as an effort to create a standardized process that would live beyond the current administration, underscoring the long duration of the counterterrorism challenge.<br/>Indeed, the president’s legal and security advisers have put considerable effort into establishing rules <br/>AND<br/>lead somebody to be subject for an engagement by the United States government."<br/>BEHIND CLOSED DOORS<br/>The argument against public debate is easy enough to understand: Operational secrecy is necessary<br/>AND<br/>public debate, which is going to be a hard one to win."<br/>But by keeping legal and policy positions secret, only partially sharing information even with congressional oversight committees, and declining to open a public discussion about drone use, the president and his team are asking the world to just trust that America is getting this right. While some will, many people, especially outside the United States, will see that approach as hypocritical, coming from a government that calls for transparency and the rule of law elsewhere.<br/>"I know these people, and I know how much they really, really <br/>AND<br/>would be giving you a different rendering, and much more uncertain rendering."<br/>That’s only part of the problem with the White House’s trust-us approach. <br/>AND<br/>) an imminent threat of violent attack 5) against the United States.<br/>But that’s not who is being targeted.<br/>Setting aside the administration’s redefining of "imminence" beyond all recognition, the majority <br/>AND<br/>States (another precedent that might be eagerly seized upon in the future).<br/>U.S. defense and intelligence officials reject any suggestion that the targets are <br/>AND<br/>new Secretary of State John Kerry criticized during his confirmation hearing this year.<br/>Human-rights groups might be loudest in their criticism of both the program and <br/>AND<br/>by principles and rules of the Constitution and of the Bill of Rights."<br/>PEER PRESSURE<br/>Obama promised in his 2013 State of the Union to increase the drone program’s transparency<br/>AND<br/>of the legal memos the Justice Department drafted in support of targeted killing.<br/>But, beyond that, it’s not certain Obama will do anything more to shine light on this program. Except in situations where leaks help it tell a politically expedient story of its skill at killing bad guys, the administration has done little to make a case to the public and the world at large for its use of armed drones.<br/>Already, what’s become apparent is that the White House is not interested in changing <br/>AND<br/>largely off the table now, according to intelligence officials and committee members.<br/>Under discussion within the administration and on Capitol Hill is a potential program takeover by <br/>AND<br/>provide no guarantee of greater transparency for the public, or even Congress.<br/>And if the administration is not willing to share with lawmakers who are security-cleared to know, it certainly is not prepared to engage in a sensitive discussion, even among allies, that might begin to set the rules on use for a technology that could upend stability in already fragile and strategically significant places around the globe. Time is running out to do so.<br/>"The history of technology development like this is, you never maintain your lead very long. Somebody always gets it," said David Berteau, director of the International Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "They’re going to become cheaper. They’re going to become easier. They’re going to become interoperable," he said. "The destabilizing effects are very, very serious."<br/>Berteau is not alone. Zenko, of the Council on Foreign Relations, has <br/>AND<br/>angles on this question are why you see them in conflict right now."<br/>That’s in part a symptom of the "technological optimism" that often plagues the U.S. security community when it establishes a lead over its competitors, noted Georgetown University’s Kai-Henrik Barth. After the 1945 bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the United States was sure it would be decades before the Soviets developed a nuclear-weapon capability. It took four years.<br/>With drones, the question is how long before the dozens of states with the <br/>AND<br/>nations have gone down the pathway of first only surveillance and then arming."<br/>The opportunity to write rules that might at least guide, if not restrain, <br/>AND<br/>—to be closer to certain that their target is the right one.<br/>But even without raising standards, tightening up drone-specific restrictions in the standing <br/>AND<br/>, or 15 years—might find helpful in arguing against another’s actions.<br/>A not-insignificant faction of U.S. defense and intelligence experts, <br/>AND<br/>some weapons, including land mines, blinding lasers, and nuclear bombs.<br/>Arguably more significant than spotty legal regimes, however, is the behavior of the <br/>AND<br/>policy that it did most recently on "enhanced interrogation" of terrorists.<br/>The case against open, transparent rule-making is that it might only hamstring <br/>AND<br/>operations manual for other nations but a legal and moral one as well.</p><p>Geographic restrictions are key<br/>Rosa Brooks, Professor of Law, Georgetown University Law Center, Bernard L.

The Rule of Law <br/>At root, the idea of "rule of law" is fairly simple, <br/>AND<br/>processes and rules that reflect basic notions of justice, humanity and fairness.<br/>Precisely what constitutes a fair process is debatable, but most would agree that at <br/>AND<br/>Civil and Political Rights, to which the United States is a party.<br/>In ordinary circumstances, this bundle of universally acknowledged rights (together with international law <br/>AND<br/>States government called this an act of murder—an unlawful political assassination.<br/>B. Targeted Killing and the Law of Armed Conflict<br/>Of course, sometimes the "ordinary" legal rules do not apply. In <br/>AND<br/>the principles of necessity, humanity, proportionality,29 and distinction.30<br/>It is worth briefly explaining these principles. The principle of necessity requires parties to <br/>AND<br/>in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage expected to be gained.<br/>Finally, the principle of discrimination or distinction requires that parties to a conflict direct their actions only against combatants and military objectives, and take appropriate steps to distinguish between combatants and non-combatants.31<br/>This is a radical oversimplification of a very complex body of law.32 But <br/>AND<br/>by military necessity34 — but there are far fewer constraints on state behavior.<br/>Technically, the law of war is referred to using the Latin term "lex specialis" – special law. It is applicable in—and only in — special circumstances (in this case, armed conflict), and in those special circumstances, it supersedes "ordinary law," or "lex generalis," the "general law" that prevails in peacetime. We have one set of laws for "normal" situations, and another, more flexible set of laws for "extraordinary" situations, such as armed conflicts.<br/>None of this poses any inherent problem for the rule of law. Having one body of rules that tightly restricts the use of force and another body of rules that is far more permissive does not fundamentally undermine the rule of law, as long as we have a reasonable degree of consensus on what circumstances trigger the "special" law, and as long as the "special law" doesn’t end up undermining the general law.<br/>To put it a little differently, war, with its very different rules, <br/>AND<br/>, and between places where there’s war and places where there’s no war.<br/>Let me return now to the question of drones and targeted killings. When all <br/>AND<br/>Libyan military targets is no more controversial than the use of manned aircraft.<br/>That is because our core rule of law concerns have mostly been satisfied: we <br/>AND<br/>in the event of error or abuse (the various governments involved).35<br/>Once you take targeted killings outside hot battlefields, it’s a different story. The <br/>AND<br/>any time — with regard to any person the administration deems a combatant.<br/>The trouble is, no one outside a very small group within the US executive <br/>AND<br/>of the time, the US will not even officially acknowledge targeted killings.<br/>This leaves all the key rule-of-law questions related to the ongoing <br/>AND<br/>determinations, and what is the precise chain of command for such decisions?<br/>I think the rule of law problem here is obvious: when "armed conflict<br/>AND<br/>are they, as some human rights groups have argued, unlawful murder?<br/>C. Targeted Killing and the International Law of Self-Defense <br/>When faced with criticisms of the law of war framework as a justification for targeted <br/>AND<br/>that the defensive force used is otherwise consistent with law of war principles.<br/>Like law of war-based arguments, this general principle is superficially uncontroversial: if someone overseas is about to launch a nuclear weapon at New York City, no one can doubt that the United States has a perfect right (and the president has a constitutional duty) to use force if needed to prevent that attack, regardless of the attacker’s nationality.<br/>But once again, the devil is in the details. To start with, what constitutes an "imminent" threat? Traditionally, both international law and domestic criminal law understand that term narrowly: 37 to be "imminent," a threat cannot be distant or speculative.38 But much like the Bush Administration before it, the Obama Administration has put forward an interpretation of the word "imminent" that bears little relation to traditional legal concepts.<br/>According to a leaked 2011 Justice Department white paper39—the most detailed legal justification that has yet become public— the requirement of imminence "does not require the United States to have clear evidence that a specific attack on U.S. persons and interests will take place in the immediate future." This seems, in itself, like a substantial departure from accepted international law definitions of imminence.<br/>But the White Paper goes even further, stating that "certain members of al <br/>AND<br/>identity or status (a familiar part of the law of armed conflict).<br/>That concept of imminence has been called Orwellian, and although that is an overused epithet, in this context it seems fairly appropriate. According to the Obama Administration, "imminent" no longer means "immediate," and in fact the very absence of clear evidence indicating specific present or future attack plans becomes, paradoxically, the basis for assuming that attack may perpetually be "imminent."<br/>The 2011 Justice Department White Paper notes that the use of force in self-defense must comply with general law of war principles of necessity, proportionality, humanity, and distinction. The White Paper offers no guidance on the specific criteria for determining when an individual is a combatant (or a civilian participating directly in hostilities), however. It also offers no guidance on how to determine if a use of force is necessary or proportionate.<br/>From a traditional international law perspective, this necessity and proportionality inquiry relates both to <br/>AND<br/>American citizen abroad — or against non-citizens, for that matter?<br/>As I have noted, it is impossible for outsiders to fully evaluate US drone strikes, since so much vital information remains classified. In most cases, we know little about the identities; activities or future plans of those targeted. Nevertheless, given the increased frequency of US targeted killings in recent years, it seems reasonable to wonder whether the Administration conducts a rigorous necessity or proportionality analysis in all cases.<br/>So far, the leaked 2011 Justice Department White Paper represents the most detailed legal <br/>AND<br/>citizens are less exacting than those the Administration views as applicable to citizens.<br/>Defenders of administration targeted killing policy acknowledge that the criteria for determining how to answer these many questions have not been made public, but insist that this should not be cause for concern. The Administration has reportedly developed a detailed "playbook" outlining the targeting criteria and procedures,40, and insiders insist that executive branch officials go through an elaborate process in which they carefully consider every possible issue before determining that a drone strike is lawful.41<br/>No doubt they do, but this is somewhat cold comfort. Formal processes tend to further normalize once-exceptional activities — and "trust us" is a rather shaky foundation for the rule of law. Indeed, the whole point of the rule of law is that individual lives and freedom should not depend solely on the good faith and benevolence of government officials.<br/>As with law of war arguments, stating that US targeted killings are clearly legal under traditional self-defense principles requires some significant cognitive dissonance. Law exists to restrain untrammeled power. It is no doubt possible to make a plausible legal argument justifying each and every U.S. drone strike — but this merely suggests that we are working with a legal framework that has begun to outlive its usefulness.<br/>The real question isn’t whether U.S. drone strikes are "legal."

It also could elevate the threat to neighbors with territorial disputes with Beijing, including Vietnam, Japan, India and the Philippines. China says its drones are capable of carrying bombs and missiles as well as conducting reconnaissance, potentially turning them into offensive weapons in a border conflict.<br/>China’s increased use of drones also adds to concerns about the lack of internationally recognized standards for drone attacks. The United States has widely employed drones as a means of eliminating terror suspects in Pakistan and the Arabian Peninsula.<br/>"China is following the precedent set by the U.S. The thinking is that, `If the U.S. can do it, so can we. They’re a big country with security interests and so are we’," said Siemon Wezeman, a senior fellow at the arms transfers program at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute in Sweden, or SIPRI.<br/>"The justification for an attack would be that Beijing too has a responsibility for the safety of its citizens. There needs to be agreement on what the limits are," he said.<br/>Though China claims its military posture is entirely defensive, its navy and civilian maritime services have engaged in repeated standoffs with ships from other nations in the South China and East China seas. India, meanwhile, says Chinese troops have set up camp almost 20 kilometers (12 miles) into Indian-claimed territory.<br/>It isn’t yet known exactly what China’s latest drones are capable of, because, like most Chinese equipment, they remain untested in battle.<br/>The military and associated aerospace firms have offered little information, although in an interview last month with the official Xinhua News Agency, Yang Baikui, chief designer at plane maker COSIC, said Chinese drones were closing the gap but still needed to progress in half a dozen major areas, from airframe design to digital linkups.<br/>Executives at COSIC and drone makers ASN, Avic, and the 611 Institute declined to be interviewed by The Associated Press, citing their military links. The Defense Ministry’s latest report on the status of the military released in mid-April made no mention of drones, and spokesman Yang Yujun made only the barest acknowledgement of their existence in response to a question.<br/>"Drones are a new high-tech form of weaponry employed and used by many militaries around the world," Yang said. "China’s armed forces are developing weaponry and equipment for the purpose of upholding territorial integrity, national security and world peace. It will pose no threat to any country."<br/>Drones are already patrolling China’s borders, and a navy drone was deployed to the western province of Sichuan to provide aerial surveillance following last month’s deadly earthquake there.<br/>They may also soon be appearing over China’s maritime claims, including Japanese-controlled East China Sea islands that China considers its own. That could sharpen tensions in an area where Chinese and Japanese patrol boats already confront each other on a regular basis and Japan frequently scrambles fighters to tail Chinese manned aircraft.</p><p>SCS conflict causes extinction<br/><strong>Wittner 11</strong> (Lawrence S.

If that is correct, the organization will remain a threat for a very long time. Al-Qaeda has morphed or sprung offshoots to Saharan Africa and parts of Southeast Asia.

A recent poll shows that while most Americans approve of drone strikes, in 17 out of 20 countries, more than half of those surveyed disapprove of them.<br/>My study of leadership decapitation in 90 counter-insurgencies since the 1970s shows that when militant leaders are captured or killed militant attacks decrease, terrorist campaigns end sooner, and their outcomes tend to favor the government or third-party country, not the militants.<br/>Those opposed to drone strikes often cite the June 2009 one that targeted Pakistani Taliban <br/>AND<br/>cited drone strikes as a key motivation for his May 2010 attempted attack.<br/>Compared to manned aircraft, drones have some advantages as counter-insurgency tools, such as lower costs, longer endurance and the lack of a pilot to place in harm’s way and risk of capture. These characteristics can enable a more deliberative targeting process that serves to minimize unintentional casualties. But the weapons employed by drones are usually identical to those used via manned aircraft and can still kill civilians—creating enmity that breeds more terrorists.<br/>Yet many insurgents and terrorists have been taken off the battlefield by U.S. drones and special-operations forces. Besides Mehsud, the list includes Anwar al-Awlaki of al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula; al-Qaida deputy leader Abu Yahya al-Li-bi; and, of course, al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden. Given that list, it is possible that the drone program has prevented numerous attacks by their potential followers, like Shazad.<br/>What does the removal of al-Qaida leadership mean for U.S. national security? Though many in al-Qaida’s senior leadership cadre remain, the historical record suggests that "decapitation" will likely weaken the organization and could cripple its ability to conduct major attacks on the U.S. homeland.<br/>Killing terrorist leaders is not necessarily a knockout blow, but can make it harder for terrorists to attack the U.S. Members of al-Qaida’s central leadership, once safely amassed in northwestern Pakistan while America shifted its focus to Iraq, have been killed, captured, forced underground or scattered to various locations with little ability to communicate or move securely.<br/>Recently declassified correspondence seized in the bin Laden raid shows that the relentless pressure from the drone campaign on al-Qaida in Pakistan led bin Laden to advise al-Qaida operatives to leave Pakistan’s Tribal Areas as no longer safe. Bin Laden’s letters show that U.S. counterterrorism actions, which had forced him into self-imposed exile, had made running the organization not only more risky, but also more difficult.<br/>As al-Qaida members trickle out of Pakistan and seek sanctuary elsewhere, the U.S. military is ramping up its counterterrorism operations in Somalia and Yemen, while continuing its drone campaign in Pakistan. Despite its controversial nature, the U.S. counter-terrorism strategy has demonstrated a degree of effectiveness.<br/>The Obama administration is committed to reducing the size of the U.S. military’s footprint overseas by relying on drones, special operations forces, and other intelligence capabilities. These methods have made it more difficult for al-Qaida remnants to reconstitute a new safe haven, as Osama bin Laden did in Afghanistan in 1996, after his ouster from Sudan.</p><p>Decapitation works—-studies<br/><strong>Johnston 12</strong> (Patrick B.

urgently needs publicly to declare the legal rationale behind its use of drones, and defend that legal rationale in the international community, which is increasingly convinced that parts, if not all, of its use is a violation of international law.<br/>• Second, the legal rationale offered by the United States government needs to take <br/>AND<br/>future reasons for using force that have no relationship to the current situation.<br/>• Third, the proper legal rationale for the use of force in drone operations in special, sometimes covert, operations outside of traditional zones of armed conflict is the customary international law doctrine of self-defense, rather than the narrower law of armed conflict.<br/>• Fourth, Congress has vital roles to play here, mostly in asserting the

The United States might assert in these cases that the armed conflict goes <br/>AND<br/>. The three main contending legal views at this point are as follows:<br/>• One legal view (the traditional view and that presumably taken by the Obama <br/>AND<br/>a combatant, other things being equal, surely cannot be at issue.<br/>• A second legal view directly contradicts the first, and says that the legal <br/>AND<br/>some place where, to some extent, it is protected against attack.<br/>• A third legal view (to which I subscribe) says that armed conflict <br/>AND<br/>do not rise to the sustained levels of fighting that legally define hostilities.<br/>• Why is self-defense the appropriate legal doctrine for attacks taking place away <br/>AND<br/>the law’s threshold definition – but instead the law of self-defense.<br/>• Is self-defense law simply a standardless license wantonly to kill?

Pa. L. Rev. 1165</p><p>One might be skeptical that a nation like the United States would ever accept such constraints on the exercise of its authority. There are, however, several reasons why doing so would be in the United States’ best interest.<br/>First, as described in Section II.B, the general framework is largely consistent with current U.S. practice since 2006. The United States has, as a matter of policy, adopted important limits on its use of out-of-battlefield targeting and law-of-war detention suggesting an implicit recognition of the value and benefits of restraint.<br/>Second, while the proposed substantive and procedural safeguards are more stringent than those that <br/>AND<br/>detention without charge and targeted killing can yield legitimacy and security benefits. n218<br/>Third, limiting the exercise of these authorities outside zones of active hostilities better accommodates <br/>AND<br/>development of an international consensus as to the rules that ought to apply.<br/>Fourth, such self-imposed restrictions are more consistent with the United States’ long-standing role as a champion of human rights and the rule of law a role that becomes difficult for the United States to play when viewed as supporting broad-based law-of-war authority that gives it wide latitude to employ force as a first resort and bypass otherwise applicable human rights and domestic law enforcement norms.<br/>Fifth, and critically, while the United States might be confident that it will <br/>AND<br/>American citizen, the United States would have few principled grounds for objecting.</p><p>Congressional restriction key to credibility and signal<br/>Kenneth Anderson, Professor of Law, Washington College of Law, American University, and Research Fellow, The Hoover Institution, Stanford University and Member of its Task Force on National Security and the Law, 5/11/2009, Targeted Killing in U.S. Counterterrorism Strategy and Law, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.brookings.edu/~~/media/research/files/papers/2009/5/1120counterterrorism20anderson/0511_counterterrorism_anderson.pdf  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.brookings.edu/~~/media/research/files/papers/2009/5/1120counterterrorism20anderson/0511_counterterrorism_anderson.pdf%27" tppabs="http://www.brookings.edu/~~/media/research/files/papers/2009/5/1120counterterrorism20anderson/0511_counterterrorism_anderson.pdf"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.brookings.edu/~~/media/research/files/papers/2009/5/1120counterterrorism20anderson/0511_counterterrorism_anderson.pdf</span></a></span></p><p>What Should Congress Do?<br/>Does this analysis offer any practical policy prescriptions for Congress and the administration?

The assertion, that is, that the United States sees its conduct as permissible for itself and for others. And it is the putting of congressional strength</p><p>&nbsp;behind the official statements of the executive branch as the opinio juris of the United States, its authoritative view of what international law is on this subject.

It has since gone through multiple iterations.<br/>The initial concept followed on the federal full-scale Top Official ("TopOff") exercises, used to train government officials to respond to domestic crises.165 It adapted a Tabletop Exercise, designed with the help of exercise officials at DHS and FEMA, to the law school environment. The Tabletop used one storyline to push on specific legal questions, as students, assigned roles in the discussion, sat around a table and for six hours engaged with the material.<br/>The problem with the Tabletop Exercise was that it was too static, and the <br/>AND<br/>focused on specific legal issues, even as it controlled for external chaos.<br/>The opportunity to provide a more full experience for the students came with the creation of first a one-day, and then a multi-day simulation. The course design and simulation continues to evolve. It offers a model for achieving the pedagogical goals outlined above, in the process developing a rigorous training ground for the next generation of national security lawyers.166<br/>A. Course Design<br/>The central idea in structuring the NSL Sim 2.0 course was to bridge <br/>AND<br/>and legal education) and flexible (responsive to student input and decisionmaking).<br/>Perhaps the most significant weakness in the use of any constructed universe is the problem <br/>AND<br/>student decisions themselves must drive the evolution of events within the simulation.168<br/>Additionally, while authenticity matters, it is worth noting that at some level the <br/>AND<br/>that would be much more difficult to do in a regular practice setting.<br/>NSL Sim 2.0 takes as its starting point the national security pedagogical goals discussed above. It works backwards to then engineer a classroom, cyber, and physical/simulation experience to delve into each of these areas. As a substantive matter, the course focuses on the constitutional, statutory, and regulatory authorities in national security law, placing particular focus on the interstices between black letter law and areas where the field is either unsettled or in flux.<br/>A key aspect of the course design is that it retains both the doctrinal and <br/>AND<br/>giving students the opportunity to develop depth and breadth prior to the exercise.<br/>In order to capture problems related to adaptation and evolution, addressing goal ~1<br/>AND<br/>Law to build the cyber portal used for NSL Sim 2.0.<br/>The twin goals of adaptation and evolution require that students be given a significant amount <br/>AND<br/>execution of the play, further developing their understanding of national security law.<br/>Throughout the simulation, the Control Team is constantly reacting to student choices. When unexpected decisions are made, professors may choose to pursue the evolution of the story to accomplish the pedagogical aims, or they may choose to cut off play in that area (there are various devices for doing so, such as denying requests, sending materials to labs to be analyzed, drawing the players back into the main storylines, and leaking information to the media).<br/>A total immersion simulation involves a number of scenarios, as well as systemic noise<br/>AND<br/>but to embrace them as part of the challenge facing national security lawyers.<br/>The simulation itself is problem-based, giving players agency in driving the evolution <br/>AND<br/>, generating in turn a set of new issues that must be addressed.<br/>The written and oral components of the simulation conform to the fourth pedagogical goal – <br/>AND<br/>simulation – and to deliver a 90 second oral briefing after the session.<br/>To replicate the high-stakes political environment at issue in goals (1) <br/>AND<br/>many different considerations that decisionmakers take into account in the national security domain.<br/>Scenarios are selected with high consequence events in mind, to ensure that students recognize <br/>AND<br/>to emphasize the broader political context within which national security law is practiced.<br/>Both anticipated and unanticipated decisions give rise to ethical questions and matters related to the <br/>AND<br/>exercise itself hitting the aim of the integration of the various pedagogical goals.<br/>Finally, there are multiple layers of feedback that players receive prior to, during<br/>AND<br/>, while another Control Team member may reject a FISC application as insufficient.<br/>The simulation goes beyond this, however, focusing on teaching students how to develop <br/>AND<br/>uncertainty, tension with colleagues, mistakes, and successes in the future.<br/>B. Substantive Areas: Interstices and Threats<br/>As a substantive matter, NSL Sim 2.0 is designed to take account <br/>AND<br/>weapons and pandemic disease also come within the doctrinal part of the course.<br/>The simulation itself is based on five to six storylines reflecting the interstices between different areas of the law. The storylines are used to present a coherent, non-linear scenario that can adapt to student responses. Each scenario is mapped out in a three to seven page document, which is then checked with scientists, government officials, and area experts for consistency with how the scenario would likely unfold in real life.<br/>For the biological weapons and pandemic disease emphasis, for example, one narrative might <br/>AND<br/>through press releases, weather updates, private communications, and the like.<br/>The five to six storylines, prepared by the Control Team in consultation with experts<br/>AND<br/>, giving the Control Team a birds-eye view of the progression.<br/>C. How It Works<br/>As for the nuts and bolts of the simulation itself, it traditionally begins outside of class, in the evening, on the grounds that national security crises often occur at inconvenient times and may well involve limited sleep and competing demands.171 Typically, a phone call from a Control Team member posing in a role integral to one of the main storylines, initiates play.<br/>Students at this point have been assigned dedicated simulation email addresses and provided access to <br/>AND<br/>relevant student teams. The Control Team has access to the complete site.<br/>For the next two (or three) days, outside of student initiatives (<br/>AND<br/>, or technology concerns, while setting the stage for the breaking crisis.<br/>The third (or fourth) day of play takes place entirely at Georgetown Law<br/>AND<br/>releases. Students use their own laptop computers for team decisions and communication.<br/>As the storylines unfold, the Control Team takes on a variety of roles, <br/>AND<br/>the simulation unfolded, and how the students performed in their various capacities.<br/>At the end of the day, the exercise terminates and an immediate hotwash is held, in which players are first debriefed on what occurred during the simulation. Because of the players’ divergent experiences and the different roles assigned to them, the students at this point are often unaware of the complete picture.

All the later generations have the task of actualizing the still-untapped normative substance of the system of rights.59<br/>A constitutional order and its interpretive history represent a community’s attempt to render the terms <br/>AND<br/>enter the community and as new circumstances, problems, and perspectives emerge.<br/>The stakes involved in sustaining a broad and inclusive constitutional discourse turn out to be <br/>AND<br/>role of citizens as legislators of the order to which they are subject.<br/>~Dignity~ can be established only within the framework of a constitutional state, something that never emerges of its own accord. Rather, this framework must be created by the citizens themselves using the means of positive law and must be protected and developed under historically changing conditions. As a modern legal concept, human dignity is associated with the status that citizens assume in the self-created political order.62<br/>Although the implications of invoking dignity (as opposed to, say, autonomy) as the normative core of democratic constitutionalism are unclear,63 plainly Habermas remains committed to strongly intersubjective conceptions of democratic constitutionalism, to an intersubjectivity that continues to be legally and politically mediated (a dimension largely absent from Honneth’s successor theory of intersubectivity).<br/>What all of this suggests is a constitutional politics in which citizens are empowered to <br/>AND<br/>rearticulation of basic norms is necessary for the very emergence of generalizable interests.<br/>Despite offering an admirably systematic synthesis of radical democracy and the constitutional rule of law<br/>AND<br/>administration of constitutional issues as it exists in the United States and Germany.<br/>This is evident in Habermas’ embrace of figures from liberal constitutional theory. He does <br/>AND<br/>placing vast decision-making powers in the hands of the judiciary.7<br/>There is more than a little here that should make Habermas uncomfortable. Firstly, <br/>AND<br/>of law through technical interpretation and rational intuition into a fixed moral order.<br/>Also puzzling is the degree of influence exercised by civil society in the development of <br/>AND<br/>conception of constitutionalism could unlock greater democratic freedom and rationally integrated social identities.<br/>Given these problems in Habermas’ theory, the innovations that Benhabib makes to his conception <br/>AND<br/>as-use theories, emphasizes how meaning is inevitably transformed through repetition:<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process of repeating a term or a concept, we never simply <br/>AND<br/>its dissolution as the original and its preservation through its continuous deployment.80<br/>Recalling the reciprocal relationship that Hegel hints at between the narrow "political" constitution <br/>AND<br/>events and has the tendency to have a destabilizing effect on authority.82<br/>It is telling, however, that Benhabib’s examples of democratic iterations are exclusively centered <br/>AND<br/>with questions of moral rights and collective identities without subordinating or conflating them.<br/>4.?Conclusion<br/>Some readers may find the general notion of reinvigorating a politics of constitutionalism quixotic. <br/>AND<br/>to aim at recapturing while critiquing more legalistic and authoritarian models of law.<br/>This is not to deny the possibility that democratic iterations themselves may be regressive or <br/>AND<br/>, without the triumphalist pretension of ever being able to fully do so.</p><p>6) Legal interventions work and the alt is worse<br/>Joseph <strong>Margulies and</strong> Hope <strong>Metcalf 11</strong>, Joe is a law prof at Northwestern, Hope is a lecturer at Yale Law, "Terrorizing Academia", Journal of Legal Education, Volume 60, Number 3 (February 2011)</p><p>From the vantage of 2010, it appears the interventionist position—our position—<br/>AND<br/>of the complicated tendency of narratives to generate backlash and counter-narratives.<br/>But there is another tendency we must resist, and that is the impulse to <br/>AND<br/>the law should be, but how it functions and whom it serves.</p><p>7) The alt doesn’t influence legal decisionmaking and results in tyranny<br/>Paul <strong>Passavant</strong>, Ph.D., Hobart and William Smith College Associate Professor of Political Science, December 20<strong>10</strong>, Yoo’s Law, Sovereignty, and Whatever, Constellations &nbsp;Volume 17, Issue 4, pages 549–571</p><p>For some on the left, it has become conventional to celebrate, if not <br/>AND<br/>of language as pure means beyond a preoccupation with true or false propositions.<br/>In his best-known work, Agamben links sovereignty to the production of rightless subjects and the Nazi death camps. He urges us to rethink the very ontological basis of politics in the West, creating a human being beyond sovereignty or law, in order to avoid perilous outcomes. One key to surpassing the logic of sovereignty, according to Agamben, is whatever being’s positive relation to the singularities of life and the multiplicities of communication.<br/>Whatever being is also being outside of law. If "law" persists in this "coming community," it would be a "law" that has become deactivated and deposed from its prior purposes. "Law" will have become an object for play – something to be toyed with the way that children might come upon a disused object and play with it by putting it to uses disconnected from whatever purpose this object might once have had.<br/>Why does the fact of playful communicative possibilities lead to either more democracy or a <br/>AND<br/>this instance shows, does not lead necessarily to outcomes friendly to democracy.<br/>In this essay, I investigate how playing with the multiplicity of communicative possibilities can, contrary to Agamben’s expectations, actually facilitate aspirations for unitary sovereign power. My argument unfolds in the context of the legal arguments put forward by Bush administration lawyer John Yoo, particularly those enabling torturous interrogations.<br/>Those, like Agamben, who favor interpretive pluralism in itself rarely, if ever<br/>AND<br/>pure mediality that Agamben describes and to which he contends politics should aspire?<br/>In this paper, I describe how Yoo gestures toward pure mediality, as he <br/>AND<br/>consistently in the direction of absolute presidential decisionism to be open to whatever.<br/>Instead, Yoo’s work may capture a broader development within our society that Agamben describes <br/>AND<br/>1974, and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) of 1978.<br/>In contrast, almost no one seems to have noticed that the Bush administration claimed <br/>AND<br/>constitutional "illiterates."5 Perhaps law is being deposed as Agamben suggests.<br/>Both Agamben’s and Fein’s observations may also indicate a failure of what Michel Foucault would <br/>AND<br/>in contemporary society and describes this as the decline of symbolic efficiency.8<br/>In sum, there appears to be a phenomenon emerging in contemporary society that a <br/>AND<br/>kind of threat that whatever being poses to the state or to sovereignty.<br/>Contrary to Agamben’s contentions, I find that whatever being is no threat at all <br/>AND<br/>recalling that this was the purpose of the U.S. Constitution.</p><p>9) Bare life is a bad theory because it can’t account for the effect of legal interventions like the aff<br/>Jef <strong>Huysmans 8</strong>, Senior Lecturer in the Department of Politics and International Studies (POLIS) at the Open University, UK, The Jargon of Exception—On Schmitt, Agamben and the Absence of Political Society, International Political Sociology (2008) 2, 165–183</p><p>Even if one would argue that Agamben’s framing of the current political conditions are valuable <br/>AND<br/>as the central processes through which individualized bodily resistances gain their sociopolitical signi?cance.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h2 id="H2ACBanDrones" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>2AC Ban Drones</span></h2><p>4) Can’t solve prolif – it’s like a non-nuclear state trying to convince Russia to sign an arms reduction treaty<br/>Anderson 13 Kenneth <strong>Anderson</strong>, professor of international law at Washington College of Law, American University, and visiting fellow at the Hoover Institution, and Matthew Waxman, a professor of law at Columbia Law School and an adjunct senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, 4/9/<strong>13</strong>, Law and Ethics for Autonomous weapon Systems: Why a Ban Won’t Work and How the Laws of War Can, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.hoover.org/publications/monographs/144241  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.hoover.org/publications/monographs/144241%27" tppabs="http://www.hoover.org/publications/monographs/144241"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.hoover.org/publications/monographs/144241</span></a></span></p><p>Conclusion<br/>The incremental development and deployment of autonomous weapon systems is inevitable, and any attempt <br/>AND<br/>international-national dialogue designed to foster common standards and spread best practices.<br/>Taken as a whole, these policy proposals reflect a rather traditional approach— relying on the gradual evolution and adaptation of long-standing law of armed conflict principles—to regulate what seems to many like a revolutionary technological and ethical predicament. That is in part because the challenge of regulating apparently radical innovations in weaponry within a long-standing legal and ethical framework is hardly novel.<br/>Some view the emergence of automated and autonomous weapon systems as a crisis for the law and ethics of war. To the contrary, provided we start now to incorporate legal and ethical norms adapted to weapons that incorporate emerging technologies of automation, the incremental movement from automation to machine autonomy can be both regulated and made to serve the ends of law on the battlefield.</p><p>5) Empirics – norms have to come first<br/>Josh <strong>Calder 13</strong>, partner at the futures consulting firm Foresight Alliance, Why Armed Drones Won’t Be Banned, February 5, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.wfs.org/blogs/josh-calder/why-armed-drones-wont-be-banned  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.wfs.org/blogs/josh-calder/why-armed-drones-wont-be-banned%27" tppabs="http://www.wfs.org/blogs/josh-calder/why-armed-drones-wont-be-banned"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.wfs.org/blogs/josh-calder/why-armed-drones-wont-be-banned</span></a></span></p><p>But that won’t be enough to get them banned.

Drones, on the other hand, will become steadily more capable.<br/>Accelerating computing power will drive this process, and remotely controlled and robotic systems will become better than humans at ever more tasks. A researcher on NOVA’s "Rise of the Drones" pointed out that a human takes 80 milliseconds to react, while a drone can respond to a situation in one millisecond. In many combat situations, that will decide who gets destroyed.<br/>Going forward<br/>As a result, there is almost no chance that the world’s militaries will not adopt them wholeheartedly. This need not result in a deterioration of human rights, however. These factors might help:<br/>Governments using drones and combat robots need to be told by other states and by their citizens that it matters how they are used.<br/>The international community should continue to strengthen norms about civilian casualties, for instance supporting prosecutions in the International Criminal Court; norm changes have been significant over the last 50 years.<br/>Leaders and military officers who deploy robotic systems should be held responsible for both the deployment decision and its outcomes, so that that they have concrete incentives to act responsibly.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>4) Links to politics- causes massive controversy<br/><strong>Goldsmith 13&nbsp;</strong>(Jack, Lawfare, "More on Drone Shift from CIA to DOD," March 21, 2013, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.lawfareblog.com/2013/03/more-on-drone-shift-from-dod-to-cia/)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.lawfareblog.com/2013/03/more-on-drone-shift-from-dod-to-cia/)%27" tppabs="http://www.lawfareblog.com/2013/03/more-on-drone-shift-from-dod-to-cia/)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.lawfareblog.com/2013/03/more-on-drone-shift-from-dod-to-cia/)</span></a></span></p><p>Following up on Wells’ post, I increasingly think that the shift in drone authorities <br/>AND<br/>details here) could have large consequences for the success of any shift.</p><p>DoD Shift doesn’t solve either advantage<br/><strong>Zakaria 13&nbsp;</strong>(Rafia, Aljazeera, "President Obama: The drones don’t work, they just make it worse," March 26, 2013, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2013/03/201332685936147309.html)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2013/03/201332685936147309.html)%27" tppabs="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2013/03/201332685936147309.html)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2013/03/201332685936147309.html)</span></a></span></p><p>Moving the drone program from the CIA to the Department of Defense is thus being <br/>AND<br/>the world, wherever a possible or even supposed threat can be identified.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h2 id="H2acSecurity" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>2ac Security</span></h2><p>One speech act doesn’t cause securitization – it’s an ongoing process<br/>Ghughunishvili 10<br/>Securitization of Migration in the United States after 9/11: Constructing Muslims and Arabs as Enemies &nbsp;Submitted to Central European University Department of International Relations European Studies In partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts Supervisor: Professor Paul Roe <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.etd.ceu.hu/2010/ghughunishvili_irina.pdf-http://www.etd.ceu.hu/2010/ghughunishvili_irina.pdf  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path excluded from retrieval by the project\%27s Exclusions properties.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.etd.ceu.hu/2010/ghughunishvili_irina.pdf-http://www.etd.ceu.hu/2010/ghughunishvili_irina.pdf%27" tppabs="http://www.etd.ceu.hu/2010/ghughunishvili_irina.pdf-http://www.etd.ceu.hu/2010/ghughunishvili_irina.pdf"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.etd.ceu.hu/2010/ghughunishvili_irina.pdf-http://www.etd.ceu.hu/2010/ghughunishvili_irina.pdf</span></a></span></p><p>As provided by the Copenhagen School securitization theory is comprised by speech act, acceptance <br/>AND<br/>the same language as the securitizing actors and can relate to their speeches.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s inevitable<br/>Mearsheimer 1, Poli.

Critics have suggested with increasing volume that the president, mired in a second-term slump, may be losing the support of the progressive base that has underpinned his electoral success.<br/>They say the president’s inability to win over his allies in Congress on arguably the biggest foreign policy and economic decisions of his second term illustrate either that Obama is a lame duck, or that his third-way neoliberalism has fallen out of vogue with the young progressives who now dominate the Democratic Party.<br/>Last week, the AFL-CIO adopted a resolution harshly critical of the way the president was implementing Obama-Care. Earlier this summer, top Democrats openly questioned why the president had doubled down on surveillance programs begun during the George W. Bush administration. Even external events, like last week’s Democratic primary victory for progressive Bill de Blasio over establishment candidates in the New York mayoral race, have been cited as evidence of shifting sands.</p><p>2) Zero risk of a budget resolution<br/>Stan <strong>Collendar</strong>, Journalist, <strong>9/16</strong>/13, This Year’s Budget Fight Isn’t About The Budget, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://ourfuture.org/20130916/this-years-budget-fight-isnt-about-the-budget  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://ourfuture.org/20130916/this-years-budget-fight-isnt-about-the-budget%27" tppabs="http://ourfuture.org/20130916/this-years-budget-fight-isnt-about-the-budget"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://ourfuture.org/20130916/this-years-budget-fight-isnt-about-the-budget</span></a></span></p><p>There are many reasons why the budget fight that will take pace over the next few weeks and months will be more difficult than any of the close-to-debacles that have occurred in recent years.<br/>The reasons include John Boehner (R-OH), who was already the weakest <br/>AND<br/>further spending reductions, standing pat at current levels or spending increases impossible.<br/>Add to this "crisis fatigue." So many actual or man-made economic and financial disasters have occurred in recent years that the kinds of things that used to scare Congress and the White House into compromising — like possible federal defaults and government shutdowns — no longer motivate them to act.<br/>But none of these admittedly depressing factors are what makes this year’s budget cliffhanger so difficult. This year the biggest complication is that the budget fight isn’t really about the budget: It’s about ObamaCare, and that makes it hard to see what kind of arrangement will garner enough votes to avoid the kind of shutdown and debt ceiling disasters that have been only narrowly averted the past few years.<br/>It’s one thing if the debate is just about coming up with a spending cap or deficit limit. If, for example, one side wants spending at 2420 and the other wants 2410, there should be some number between those two that eventually will make a deal possible.<br/>But what happens when, like now, the budget is the legislative vehicle but the real debate is over something else entirely? What that happens, there is no number that will satisfy everyone in the debate and the budget process — which is designed to compromise numbers rather than policy — becomes an incredibly in effective way to negotiate.<br/>That’s when all of the other factors I noted above kick in. If the <br/>AND<br/>supported. And that’s if a deal of some kind is even possible.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p> &nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>3) Whatever capital the plan costs Obama, its not relevant to the fiscal fights<br/>Ed <strong>Kilgore</strong>, Washington Monthly, <strong>9/5</strong>/13, Obama’s Political Capital, www.washingtonmonthly.com/political-animal-a/2013_09/obamas_political_capital046735.php~23</p><p>An even hoarier meme than the no-win-war complaint is naturally emerging in Washington as everyone recalibrates his or her assumptions about how the year will end: Obama’s limited "political capital" that he might have used on the fiscal front will now be "spread thin" or "stretched to the breaking point" by the need to make a case for military action against Syria. Politico’s Brown and Sherman give it a full airing today:<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President Barack Obama faced a heavy lift in Congress this fall when his agenda included only budget issues and immigration reform.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now with Syria in the mix, the president appears ready to spend a lot of the political capital that he would have kept in reserve for his domestic priorities.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A resolution authorizing the use of force in Syria won’t make it through the House or the Senate without significant cajoling from the White House. That means Obama, who struggles to get Congress to follow his lead on almost everything, could burn his limited leverage convincing Democrats and Republicans to vote for an unpopular military operation that even the president says he could carry out with or without their approval.<br/>Now this may be true with respect to congressional Democrats if Obama ultimately needs them <br/>AND<br/>he can. But he has no "political capital" to spend.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>4) If a deal is reached, its because of necessity not capital<br/>Ruth <strong>Marcus</strong>, RCP, <strong>9/20</strong>/13, On Debt Ceiling, a Different Feel, www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2013/09/20/on_debt_ceiling_a_different_feel_120005.html</p><p>But leaving the government unable to borrow enough money to pay the debts it has already incurred is a different matter entirely. Breaching the debt ceiling evokes words like catastrophic and unthinkable, which is why it has never happened.<br/>And why the notion that it might is so surprising. Astonishing, actually. Washington is used to government by crisis and deadline. Our creaky system is capable of rousing itself only when the train is bearing down the tracks.<br/>So my usual way of analyzing these moments is to reason backward: The debt ceiling must be raised.<br/>Therefore it will be. The situation will seem to be at an unbreakable stalemate until, suddenly, a solution appears. Everyone will breathe a sigh of relief — until the inevitable next act in our political psychodrama.

After weeks of trying to rally Congress to support him on a fast-changing policy in Syria, President Barack Obama may have broken the bank on what political capital he has left in his second term.<br/>Congressman Steve Israel, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said he was surprised by how politicized the vote for military authorization in Syria has become.<br/>Several Democratic representatives, including former veterans Rep. Tammy Duckworth and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, oppose authorization.<br/>"It’s military families like mine that are the first to bleed when our nation makes this kind of commitment," Duckworth said in a statement.<br/>But Israel said Obama is not hurting his credibility with Democratic members of the House, adding that after a Democratic caucus briefing, the party is now focused on Russia’s diplomatic proposal to disarm Syria of its stockpile of nuclear weapons.<br/>"Our focus on both sides of the aisle right now, quite honestly, is on ensuring that this is a legitimate, transparent, verifiable proposal," said Israel.<br/>But much of the Democratic caucus, people Israel helped get elected in the last cycle, are against the president.<br/>Asked if that lack of support stems from a distant relationship with the president, Israel said no, saying it is the shadow of Iraq that is driving Democrats’ doubts on authorizing a strike against Syria.<br/>"It has more to do with the concern that many of my colleagues had with intelligence in the prior administration," said Israel. There "is a sense that we’ve been down this road. We’re dubious when the intelligence community tells us that there are weapons of mass destruction. Been there done that."<br/>Moreover, Israel adds, a relationship with the president should not play a role in evaluating a vote of this nature.<br/>"The relationship actually should be put aside when you’re making decisions on whether to commit force," said Israel. "You’ve got to make a judgment not based on do I like this president, but do I believe the intelligence, and do I believe that his recommendation is the most appropriate course for the national security interests of this country?"<br/>Obama’s lack of support on Syria could cast a shadow on other legislative agendas, such as the upcoming debt ceiling debate.<br/>"The issue is not whether the President of the United States has expended his political capital. The issue is whether House Republicans are willing to spend any of theirs," said Israel.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>9) Alignment means congress is down with the plan too<br/>Douglas <strong>Kriner</strong>, Assistant Profess of Political Science at Boston University, 20<strong>10</strong>, After the Rubicon: Congress, Presidents, and the Politics of Waging War, p. 59-60</p><p>Presidents and politicos alike have long recognized Congress’s ability to reduce the political costs that <br/>AND<br/>.S. interests or the constitutionality of the War Powers Resolution."36</p><p> &nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>11) And its empirically proven he’ll avoid the fight<br/>William <strong>Howell and&nbsp;</strong>Jon <strong>Pevehouse</strong>, Associate Professors at the Harris School of Public Policy at the University of Chicago, 200<strong>7</strong>, When Congress Stops Wars, Foreign Affairs, EBSCO</p><p>After all, when presidents anticipate congressional resistance they will not be able to overcome<br/>AND<br/>Pace, so as to avoid a clash with Congress over his reappointment.</p><p> &nbsp;<br/>14) No Impact<br/><strong>Fisher Investments 12</strong> (Fisher Investments is an independent investment adviser serving both individual and institutional investors, 12/10/12, Debt Ceiling Worries Are Overblown: Opinion, www.thestreet.com/story/11787447/1/debt-ceiling-worries-are-overblown-opinion.html)</p><p>The debt ceiling debate seems to have returned from the dead.

In fact, any claims that not passing a CR will result in a "shutting down" of the government "is an entirely inaccurate description" according to the DOJ.~1~<br/>Such a lapse in funding would be neither catastrophic nor unprecedented, but it would pare down government services to those most essential for "the safety of human life or the protection of property."

But don’t worry about it.<br/>That’s the message the House Republican leadership and its allies are spreading as Congress moves toward a fiscal showdown with President Barack Obama and the Democrats, a clash with huge political and economic ramifications for both parties.<br/>Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.), Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and their allies are instead privately urging rank and file to forgo a clash over government funding — and a possible government shutdown — and instead dig in against Obama and the Democratic Senate when the debt ceiling needs to be lifted sometime next month.<br/>Boehner and his top lieutenants believe that digging in for a fight over the debt ceiling gives them more leverage against Obama and Democrats. Republicans hope to take advantage of Obama’s desire to blunt 2420 billion in sequester cuts that kick in Jan. 1 to reach a broader budget deal with the White House.<br/>There’s even been chatter in and around leadership about holding a vote on a debt ceiling bill before the government funding measure — a way to satiate conservatives’ budget-cutting hunger and help avoid a government shutdown.<br/>Center stage in all of this is funding Obamacare. Roughly 30 Republicans refused to vote for a government funding bill if it provides money for the health care law. GOP leadership thought giving those lawmakers a vote on defunding the law and kicking it over the Senate would be enough.<br/>They were wrong.<br/>Now instead of leadership’s strategy of moving the fight to the Senate, Republicans are coalescing around having the battle in the House. That’s why leadership’s strategy is far from certain to work.<br/>According to internal House GOP counts, roughly two-dozen House Republicans are refusing to vote for a continuing resolution that funds Obamacare. After rejecting Cantor’s funding plan — which would’ve funded the government at the 24988 billion level while including nonbinding language defunding Obamacare — dozens of Republicans have signed on to a bill by Rep. Tom Graves (R-Ga.), which funds the government at 24967 billion in 2014 while delaying implementation of Obamacare until 2015.<br/>Those aren’t the only challenges.<br/>House GOP leadership has acknowledged to Democrats that it has no idea how it’s going to cobble together a package to boost the debt ceiling, so urging a fight there is far from a fireproof move.<br/>Early discussions have begun over the debt ceiling, and Republicans want their opening bid to tie elements of entitlement reform to the debt ceiling, a laughable request for Democrats and the White House.<br/>But Boehner admitted to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) in a private session last week that he is not even sure he has the votes to pass a debt ceiling package with entitlement cuts. He also admitted that passing a CR will be a heavy lift.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h2 id="H2014xt7E236syriathumper" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>—xt ~236 syria thumper</span></h2><p>Syria overwhelms <br/>Ed <strong>Morrissey</strong>, Hot Air, 8/28/<strong>13</strong>, Bipartisan House coalition demands Congressional approval on Syria strike, hotair.com/archives/2013/08/28/bipartisan-house-coalition-demands-congressional-approval-on-syria-strike/</p><p>Rising discontent among members of Congress over being bypassed on Syria has a distinctly bipartisan <br/>AND<br/>. &nbsp;The group contains a dozen Democrats, and that number may rise:<br/>A growing bipartisan coalition in Congress is coming together to "strongly urge" President Obama "to consult and receive authorization from Congress before ordering the use of U.S. military force in Syria."<br/>In a letter that will be sent to the president later today, Rep.

This year the biggest complication is that the budget fight isn’t really about the budget: It’s about ObamaCare, and that makes it hard to see what kind of arrangement will garner enough votes to avoid the kind of shutdown and debt ceiling disasters that have been only narrowly averted the past few years.<br/>It’s one thing if the debate is just about coming up with a spending cap or deficit limit. If, for example, one side wants spending at 2420 and the other wants 2410, there should be some number between those two that eventually will make a deal possible.<br/>But what happens when, like now, the budget is the legislative vehicle but the real debate is over something else entirely?

That means Obama, who struggles to get Congress to follow his lead on almost everything, could burn his limited leverage convincing Democrats and Republicans to vote for an unpopular military operation that even the president says he could carry out with or without their approval.<br/>Now this may be true with respect to congressional Democrats if Obama ultimately needs them <br/>AND<br/>he can. But he has no and#34;political capitaland#34; to spend.</p><p>4) If a deal is reached, its because of necessity not capital<br/>Ruth <strong>Marcus</strong>, RCP, <strong>9/20</strong>/13, On Debt Ceiling, a Different Feel, www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2013/09/20/on_debt_ceiling_a_different_feel_120005.html</p><p>But leaving the government unable to borrow enough money to pay the debts it has already incurred is a different matter entirely. Breaching the debt ceiling evokes words like catastrophic and unthinkable, which is why it has never happened.<br/>And why the notion that it might is so surprising. Astonishing, actually. Washington is used to government by crisis and deadline. Our creaky system is capable of rousing itself only when the train is bearing down the tracks.<br/>So my usual way of analyzing these moments is to reason backward: The debt ceiling must be raised.<br/>Therefore it will be. The situation will seem to be at an unbreakable stalemate until, suddenly, a solution appears. Everyone will breathe a sigh of relief — until the inevitable next act in our political psychodrama. Panic, solve, repeat.</p><p><strong>6) The prior Syria debate was sufficient to deplete Obama’s capital<br/>Jake&nbsp;</strong>Tapper<strong>, CNN,&nbsp;</strong>9/12<strong>/13, Has Obama paid political price for Syria?, thelead.blogs.cnn.com/2013/09/12/has-obama-paid-political-price-for-syria/</strong></p><p>Has Obama paid political price for Syria?<br/>Political capital does not come cheap in Washington, D.C. After weeks of trying to rally Congress to support him on a fast-changing policy in Syria, President Barack Obama may have broken the bank on what political capital he has left in his second term.<br/>Congressman Steve Israel, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said he was surprised by how politicized the vote for military authorization in Syria has become.<br/>Several Democratic representatives, including former veterans Rep. Tammy Duckworth and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, oppose authorization.<br/>and#34;It’s military families like mine that are the first to bleed when our nation makes this kind of commitment,and#34; Duckworth said in a statement.<br/>But Israel said Obama is not hurting his credibility with Democratic members of the House, adding that after a Democratic caucus briefing, the party is now focused on Russia’s diplomatic proposal to disarm Syria of its stockpile of nuclear weapons.<br/>and#34;Our focus on both sides of the aisle right now, quite honestly, is on ensuring that this is a legitimate, transparent, verifiable proposal,and#34; said Israel.<br/>But much of the Democratic caucus, people Israel helped get elected in the last cycle, are against the president.<br/>Asked if that lack of support stems from a distant relationship with the president, Israel said no, saying it is the shadow of Iraq that is driving Democrats’ doubts on authorizing a strike against Syria.<br/>and#34;It has more to do with the concern that many of my colleagues had with intelligence in the prior administration,and#34; said Israel. There and#34;is a sense that we’ve been down this road. We’re dubious when the intelligence community tells us that there are weapons of mass destruction. Been there done that.and#34;<br/>Moreover, Israel adds, a relationship with the president should not play a role in evaluating a vote of this nature.<br/>and#34;The relationship actually should be put aside when you’re making decisions on whether to commit force,and#34; said Israel. and#34;You’ve got to make a judgment not based on do I like this president, but do I believe the intelligence, and do I believe that his recommendation is the most appropriate course for the national security interests of this country?and#34;<br/>Obama’s lack of support on Syria could cast a shadow on other legislative agendas, such as the upcoming debt ceiling debate.<br/>and#34;The issue is not whether the President of the United States has expended his political capital. The issue is whether House Republicans are willing to spend any of theirs,and#34; said Israel.</p><p>9) Alignment means congress is down with the plan too<br/>Douglas <strong>Kriner</strong>, Assistant Profess of Political Science at Boston University, 20<strong>10</strong>, After the Rubicon: Congress, Presidents, and the Politics of Waging War, p. 59-60</p><p>Presidents and politicos alike have long recognized Congress’s ability to reduce the political costs that <br/>AND<br/>.S. interests or the constitutionality of the War Powers Resolution.and#34;36</p><p>11) And its empirically proven he’ll avoid the fight<br/>William <strong>Howell and&nbsp;</strong>Jon <strong>Pevehouse</strong>, Associate Professors at the Harris School of Public Policy at the University of Chicago, 200<strong>7</strong>, When Congress Stops Wars, Foreign Affairs, EBSCO</p><p>After all, when presidents anticipate congressional resistance they will not be able to overcome<br/>AND<br/>Pace, so as to avoid a clash with Congress over his reappointment.</p><p>13) Economic collapse doesn’t cause war<br/>Jervis, professor of political science – Columbia University, ’11<br/>(Robert, Force in Our Times,and#34; Survival, Vol. 25, No. 4, p. 403-425)</p><p>Even if war is still seen as evil, the security community could be dissolved <br/>AND<br/>times bring about greater economic conflict, it will not make war thinkable.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h1 id="H1AR" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>1AR</span></h1><p>and#34;Restrictionsand#34; control when and how operations occur~—-this also answers their enforcement T violation~<br/><strong>Lobel</strong>, professor of law at the University of Pittsburgh, <strong>2008</strong><br/>(Jules, and#34;Conflicts Between the Commander in Chief and Congress: Concurrent Power over the Conduct of War,and#34; Ohio State Law Journal, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/students/groups/oslj/files/2012/04/69.3.lobel_.pdf)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/students/groups/oslj/files/2012/04/69.3.lobel_.pdf)%27" tppabs="http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/students/groups/oslj/files/2012/04/69.3.lobel_.pdf)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/students/groups/oslj/files/2012/04/69.3.lobel_.pdf)</span></a></span></p><p>The Framers of the Constitution intended that Congress have substantial power to control the conduct <br/>AND<br/>decide whether the President’s policies and strategies are those the nation should follow.</p><p>Restriction includes conditions on action<br/><strong>CAA 8</strong>,COURT OF APPEALS OF ARIZONA, DIVISION ONE, DEPARTMENT A, STATE OF ARIZONA, Appellee, v.

But don’t worry about it.<br/>That’s the message the House Republican leadership and its allies are spreading as Congress moves toward a fiscal showdown with President Barack Obama and the Democrats, a clash with huge political and economic ramifications for both parties.<br/>Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.), Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and their allies are instead privately urging rank and file to forgo a clash over government funding — and a possible government shutdown — and instead dig in against Obama and the Democratic Senate when the debt ceiling needs to be lifted sometime next month.<br/>Boehner and his top lieutenants believe that digging in for a fight over the debt ceiling gives them more leverage against Obama and Democrats. Republicans hope to take advantage of Obama’s desire to blunt 2420 billion in sequester cuts that kick in Jan. 1 to reach a broader budget deal with the White House.<br/>There’s even been chatter in and around leadership about holding a vote on a debt ceiling bill before the government funding measure — a way to satiate conservatives’ budget-cutting hunger and help avoid a government shutdown.<br/>Center stage in all of this is funding Obamacare. Roughly 30 Republicans refused to vote for a government funding bill if it provides money for the health care law. GOP leadership thought giving those lawmakers a vote on defunding the law and kicking it over the Senate would be enough.<br/>They were wrong.<br/>Now instead of leadership’s strategy of moving the fight to the Senate, Republicans are coalescing around having the battle in the House. That’s why leadership’s strategy is far from certain to work.<br/>According to internal House GOP counts, roughly two-dozen House Republicans are refusing to vote for a continuing resolution that funds Obamacare. After rejecting Cantor’s funding plan — which would’ve funded the government at the 24988 billion level while including nonbinding language defunding Obamacare — dozens of Republicans have signed on to a bill by Rep. Tom Graves (R-Ga.), which funds the government at 24967 billion in 2014 while delaying implementation of Obamacare until 2015.<br/>Those aren’t the only challenges.<br/>House GOP leadership has acknowledged to Democrats that it has no idea how it’s going to cobble together a package to boost the debt ceiling, so urging a fight there is far from a fireproof move.<br/>Early discussions have begun over the debt ceiling, and Republicans want their opening bid to tie elements of entitlement reform to the debt ceiling, a laughable request for Democrats and the White House.<br/>But Boehner admitted to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) in a private session last week that he is not even sure he has the votes to pass a debt ceiling package with entitlement cuts. He also admitted that passing a CR will be a heavy lift.</p><h2 id="H2014xt7E233pcirrelevant" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>—xt ~233 pc irrelevant</span></h2><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>There aren’t even talks to hammer out a compromise in21<br/>Norm <strong>Ornstein</strong>, AEI Senior Fellow, <strong>9/19</strong>/13, The Sequester Is a Disaster, and Congress’s Next Move May Be Worse, www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/09/the-sequester-is-a-disaster-and-congresss-next-move-may-be-worse/279819/</p><p>As readers of my past columns know, I was not exactly optimistic as we <br/>AND<br/>majorities for anything on the spending front as the new fiscal year approaches.<br/>In a misguided attempt to mollify his radicals and avoid a government shutdown over the <br/>AND<br/>push their crusade to crush Obamacare by holding the debt-ceiling hostage.<br/>Would a Government Shutdown Really Be All That Bad for Republicans?

In each case, India responded in a manner that did not escalate the conflict. Any incursion into Pakistan was extremely limited. An Indian intervention in a civil war in Pakistan would be subject to the same limitations — at least so long as the Pakistani army maintains its integrity.<br/>Given the new US–India ties, the most important factor in determining the <br/>AND<br/>some influence in Afghanistan, especially working with elements of the Northern Alliance.<br/>India and Afghanistan already have a strategic partnership agreement in place that creates the framework for their bilateral relationship to grow, but the degree of actual cooperation will depend on how Pakistan and the Taliban react. If Indian interests in Afghanistan come under attack, New Delhi might have to pull back. The Indian government has been quite clear about not sending troops to Afghanistan.<br/>If the United States shifts its policy to where it has to choose Kabul over Islamabad, in effect reviving the demand for an independent Pashtunistan, India is likely to be much more supportive of US and Afghan goals. The policy shift, however, carries the risk of a full-fledged proxy war with Pakistan in Afghanistan, but should not involve the prospect of a direct Indian intervention in Pakistan itself.<br/>India is not likely to initiate an intervention that causes the Pakistani state to fail<br/>AND<br/>government or by the radicals — from taking control of the entire country.<br/>Lieven’s analysis is more persuasive than the widespread view that Pakistan is about to fail <br/>AND<br/>out a Pakistani civil war while covertly coordinating policy with the United States.<br/>Signature strikes key to targeted killing effectiveness and preventing safe havens. <br/>Philip <strong>Mudd</strong>, former senior official at the CIA and the FBI.

In truth, the roots of the conflict — and the reasons it has not yet exploded — are much deeper. Put simply, China cannot afford military conflict with any of its Asian neighbors.<br/>It is not that China believes it would lose such a spat; the country <br/>AND<br/>, from authorizing the use of deadly force in the Diaoyu Islands theater.<br/>For over three decades, Beijing has promoted peace and stability in Asia to facilitate <br/>AND<br/>Today, China’s economy is second only to that of the United States.<br/>The fundamentals of Deng’s grand economic strategy are still revered in Beijing. But any <br/>AND<br/>thus little reason to think that China is readying for war with Japan.<br/>At the same time, the specter of rising Chinese nationalism, although often seen <br/>AND<br/>in China and, almost as quickly, catalyze popular protests against Japan.<br/>Demonstrators would call for blood, and if the government (fearing economic instability) did not extract enough, citizens would agitate against Beijing itself. Those in Zhongnanhai, the Chinese leadership compound in Beijing, would find themselves between a rock and a hard place.<br/>It is possible that Xi lost track of these basic facts during the fanfare of his rise to power and in the face of renewed Japanese assertiveness. It is also possible that the Chinese state is more rotten at the core than is understood. That is, party elites believe that a diversionary war is the only way to hold on to power — damn the economic and social consequences.<br/>But Xi does not seem blind to the principles that have served Beijing so well over the last few decades. Indeed, although he recently warned unnamed others about infringing upon China’s "national core interests" during a foreign policy speech to members of the Politburo, he also underscored China’s commitment to "never pursue development at the cost of sacrificing other country’s interests" and to never "benefit ourselves at others’ expense or do harm to any neighbor."</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h1 id="H2NC" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>2NC</span></h1><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h2 id="H2NC2014-AT:ObjectFiat" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>2NC—-AT: Object Fiat</span></h2><p>This is the key academic question<br/><strong>Sinnar</strong>, assistant professor of law at Stanford Law School, May <strong>2013</strong><br/>(Shirin, "Protecting Rights from Within?

There’s no indication this time will be any different. <br/>A total of nine suspected drone strikes reportedly have been recorded in Yemen since late July, taking out dozens of alleged Al Qaeda operatives and other militants. The most recent strike was on Saturday. The Washington Post reported last week that the strikes were authorized by the Obama administration in connection with the ongoing terror threat. <br/>If challenged on the strikes, the president is likely to argue that the operation is contained and does not require congressional authorization. He has in the past. <br/>This debate flared during the 2011 operation in Libya, when the administration launched a series of air and drone strikes in support of the campaign against Muammar Qaddafi.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Obama will fight Congress on drones—empirically tied to the issue.</strong><br/><strong>Glaser 13</strong> (John, "Congress Considers Limiting President’s Drone Authority", February 05, 2013, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://news.antiwar.com/2013/02/05/congress-considers-limiting-presidents-drone-authority/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://news.antiwar.com/2013/02/05/congress-considers-limiting-presidents-drone-authority/%27" tppabs="http://news.antiwar.com/2013/02/05/congress-considers-limiting-presidents-drone-authority/"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://news.antiwar.com/2013/02/05/congress-considers-limiting-presidents-drone-authority/</span></a></span>, ZBurdette)</p><p>A small but growing opposition in Congress to the Obama administration’s targeted killing policies is beginning to demand hearings and accountability, after a leaked legal memo this week revealed the President’s rationale for assassinating US citizens.<br/>"It has to be in the agenda of this Congress to reconsider the scope of action of drones and use of deadly force by the United States around the world because the original authorization of use of force, I think, is being strained to its limits," said Senator Chris Coons, a Democrat.<br/>According to congressional aides the Senate Foreign Relations Committee likely will hold hearings on US drone policy in the near future.<br/>Rep. Steny Hoyer, the No. 2 Democrat in the House, said Tuesday that "it deserves a serious look at how we make the decisions in government to take out, kill, eliminate, whatever word you want to use, not just American citizens but other citizens as well."<br/>A bipartisan group of 11 senators wrote a letter to President Obama requesting he provide his administration’s official legal memos justifying the use of armed drones to kill American citizens without due process.<br/>The request was issued on Monday, the same day that NBC News published an exclusive story based on a leaked Department of Justice "white paper" that was provided to Senate committees months ago.<br/>The memo, while not the official documents the senators have repeatedly requested, laid out the government’s case for targeted assassinations of US citizens accused of being terrorists even when there is no active intelligence accusing them of carrying out a specific terrorist attack.<br/>"We ask that you direct the Justice Department to provide Congress, specifically the Judiciary and Intelligence Committees, with any and all legal opinions that lay out the executive branch’s official understanding of the President’s authority to deliberately kill American citizens," the eight Democrats and three Republicans wrote.<br/>"We should be concerned when the White House is acting as judge, jury and executioner," Naureen Shah, a lecturer at Columbia Law School said. "And there’s no one outside of the White House who has real oversight over that process. What’s put forward here is there’s no role for the courts, not even after the fact."<br/>"Anyone should be concerned when the president and his lawyers make up their own interpretation of the law or their own rules," Mary Ellen O’Connell, a law professor at the University of Notre Dame and an authority on international law and the use of force told NBC News.<br/>"This is a very, very dangerous thing that the president has done," she added.<br/>The senators even suggested that they would hold up the nominations of Chuck Hagel and John Brennan if the President does not comply.<br/>"The executive branch’s cooperation on this matter will help avoid an unnecessary confrontation that could affect the Senate’s consideration of nominees for national security positions," they warned.<br/>As Marcy Wheeler points out, this is at least the 12th time this group of senators has requested the Obama administration’s legal documents on this matter.

Johnston is an associate political scientist at the RAND Corporation, a nonprofit, nonpartisan research institution. He is the author of "Does Decapitation Work? Assessing the Effectiveness of Leadership Targeting in Counterinsurgency Campaigns," published in International Security (Spring 2012)., 8/22/2012, "Drone Strikes Keep Pressure on al-Qaida", www.rand.org/blog/2012/08/drone-strikes-keep-pressure-on-al-qaida.html)</p><p>Should the U.S. continue to strike at al-Qaida’s leadership with drone attacks? A recent poll shows that while most Americans approve of drone strikes, in 17 out of 20 countries, more than half of those surveyed disapprove of them.<br/>My study of leadership decapitation in 90 counter-insurgencies since the 1970s shows that when militant leaders are captured or killed militant attacks decrease, terrorist campaigns end sooner, and their outcomes tend to favor the government or third-party country, not the militants.<br/>Those opposed to drone strikes often cite the June 2009 one that targeted Pakistani Taliban <br/>AND<br/>cited drone strikes as a key motivation for his May 2010 attempted attack.<br/>Compared to manned aircraft, drones have some advantages as counter-insurgency tools, such as lower costs, longer endurance and the lack of a pilot to place in harm’s way and risk of capture. These characteristics can enable a more deliberative targeting process that serves to minimize unintentional casualties. But the weapons employed by drones are usually identical to those used via manned aircraft and can still kill civilians—creating enmity that breeds more terrorists.<br/>Yet many insurgents and terrorists have been taken off the battlefield by U.S. drones and special-operations forces. Besides Mehsud, the list includes Anwar al-Awlaki of al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula; al-Qaida deputy leader Abu Yahya al-Li-bi; and, of course, al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden. Given that list, it is possible that the drone program has prevented numerous attacks by their potential followers, like Shazad.<br/>What does the removal of al-Qaida leadership mean for U.S. national security? Though many in al-Qaida’s senior leadership cadre remain, the historical record suggests that "decapitation" will likely weaken the organization and could cripple its ability to conduct major attacks on the U.S. homeland.<br/>Killing terrorist leaders is not necessarily a knockout blow, but can make it harder for terrorists to attack the U.S. Members of al-Qaida’s central leadership, once safely amassed in northwestern Pakistan while America shifted its focus to Iraq, have been killed, captured, forced underground or scattered to various locations with little ability to communicate or move securely.<br/>Recently declassified correspondence seized in the bin Laden raid shows that the relentless pressure from the drone campaign on al-Qaida in Pakistan led bin Laden to advise al-Qaida operatives to leave Pakistan’s Tribal Areas as no longer safe. Bin Laden’s letters show that U.S. counterterrorism actions, which had forced him into self-imposed exile, had made running the organization not only more risky, but also more difficult.<br/>As al-Qaida members trickle out of Pakistan and seek sanctuary elsewhere, the U.S. military is ramping up its counterterrorism operations in Somalia and Yemen, while continuing its drone campaign in Pakistan. Despite its controversial nature, the U.S. counter-terrorism strategy has demonstrated a degree of effectiveness.<br/>The Obama administration is committed to reducing the size of the U.S. military’s footprint overseas by relying on drones, special operations forces, and other intelligence capabilities. These methods have made it more difficult for al-Qaida remnants to reconstitute a new safe haven, as Osama bin Laden did in Afghanistan in 1996, after his ouster from Sudan.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HDronesareoperationallyeffectiveandalternativesareworse2014establishingaclearstrikepolicysolvescriticism." class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Drones are operationally effective and alternatives are worse—establishing a clear strike policy solves criticism.</span></h4><p>Byman 13 (Daniel Byman, Brookings Institute Saban Center for Middle East Policy, Research Director, and Foreign Policy, Senior Fellow, July/Aug 2013, "Why Drones Work: The Case for the Washington’s Weapon of Choice", www.brookings.edu/research/articles/2013/06/17-drones-obama-weapon-choice-us-counterterrorism-byman)</p><p>Despite President Barack Obama’s recent call to reduce the United States’ reliance on drones, <br/>AND<br/>indiscriminately bomb civilian areas or use scorched-earth tactics against militant groups. <br/> <br/>Risk of nuclear terrorism is real and high now <br/>Bunn 13 (Matthew, Valentin Kuznetsov, Martin B.

CONTROLLING THE RECOURSE TO WAR BY MODIFYING JUS IN BELLO, Yearbook of International Humanitarian Law / Volume 12</p><p>A substantial literature exists on the conflation of jus ad bellum and jus in bello. However, the consequences for the former side of the equation – the resort to war – is generally under-examined. Instead, academic commentary has focused on the effects of compliance with humanitarian rules in armed conflict and, in particular, the equality of application principle. In this section, I attempt to help correct that imbalance.<br/>In the following analysis, I use the (admittedly provocative) short-hand labels of ’desirable’ and ’undesirable’ wars. The former consists of efforts that aim to promote the general welfare of foreign populations such as humanitarian interventions and, on some accounts, peacekeeping operations. The latter – undesirable wars – include conflicts that result from security spirals that serve neither state’s interest and also include predatory acts of aggression.<br/>4.1.1 Decreased likelihood of ’desirable wars’<br/>A central question in debates about humanitarian intervention is whether the international community should be <br/>AND<br/>short, all ’interventions to protect civilians from wholesale slaughter’ are affected.<br/>Two developments render desirable interventions less likely. First, consider implications of the Kosovo <br/>AND<br/>one would most want to incentivize to initiate and participate in humanitarian interventions.<br/>The second development shares many of these same consequences. Consider the implications of the <br/>AND<br/>disproportionately affect the very states that take international human rights obligations most seriously.<br/>Notably, in these cases, the disincentives might weigh most heavily on third parties<br/>AND<br/>the international regime should prefer to be involved in these kinds of interventions.<br/>The developments regulating jus ad bellum through jus in bello also threaten to make ’<br/>AND<br/>result from the pressures created by Type I erosions of the separation principle.<br/>First, increasing the tax on humanitarian interventions (the Kosovo Commission/ICISS approach<br/>AND<br/>language (in resolutions and the like) espousing or emphasizing humanitarian objectives.<br/>Second, the elevation of self-regarding – security and strategic – frameworks over <br/>AND<br/>international disputes exert significant influence on whether conflicts will eventually culminate in war.<br/>Third, a large body of empirical research demonstrates that states will routinely engage in <br/>AND<br/>demands for increased bellicosity, unintended security spirals, and military violence.103<br/>Importantly, these effects may result even if one is skeptical about the power of <br/>AND<br/>states entering into disastrous military campaigns that their leaders did not initially intend.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HSelf-defenseregimecollapsecausesglobalwar2014USTKlegalregimekey2014onlyCongresssolvesinternationalnormdevelopment" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Self-defense regime collapse causes global war—US TK legal regime key—only Congress solves international norm development</span></h4><p>Beau <strong>Barnes</strong>, J.D., Boston University School of Law, Spring 20<strong>12</strong>, REAUTHORIZING THE "WAR ON TERROR": THE LEGAL AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS OF THE AUMF’S COMING OBSOLESCENCE, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27https://www.jagcnet.army.mil/DOCLIBS/MILITARYLAWREVIEW.NSF/20a66345129fe3d885256e5b00571830/b7396120928e9d5e85257a700042abb5/24FILE/By20Beau20D.20Barnes.pdf  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed using an unsupported protocol (e.g., gopher).  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27https://www.jagcnet.army.mil/DOCLIBS/MILITARYLAWREVIEW.NSF/20a66345129fe3d885256e5b00571830/b7396120928e9d5e85257a700042abb5/24FILE/By20Beau20D.20Barnes.pdf%27" tppabs="https://www.jagcnet.army.mil/DOCLIBS/MILITARYLAWREVIEW.NSF/20a66345129fe3d885256e5b00571830/b7396120928e9d5e85257a700042abb5/24FILE/By20Beau20D.20Barnes.pdf"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">https://www.jagcnet.army.mil/DOCLIBS/MILITARYLAWREVIEW.NSF/20a66345129fe3d885256e5b00571830/b7396120928e9d5e85257a700042abb5/24FILE/By20Beau20D.20Barnes.pdf</span></a></span></p><p>Therefore, the more likely result is that the Executive Branch, grappling with the <br/>AND<br/>prove legally fragile, destabilizing to the international political order, or both.</p><ol><li>Effect on Domestic Law and Policy<br/>Congress’s failure to reauthorize military force would lead to bad domestic law and even worse <br/>AND<br/>be to continue to rely on the September 18, 2001, AUMF.<br/>Second, basing U.S. counterterrorism efforts on the President’s constitutional authority as <br/>AND<br/>would lack stability—confounding cooperation with allies and hindering negotiations with adversaries.<br/>There are, of course, many situations where the president’s position as Commander in <br/>AND<br/>conflict than the public might otherwise ~be~ willing to support."140<br/>In a world without a valid AUMF, the United States could base its continued <br/>AND<br/>problems."141 Only then can the President’s efforts be sustained and legitimate.<br/>2.

It has since gone through multiple iterations.<br/>The initial concept followed on the federal full-scale Top Official ("TopOff") exercises, used to train government officials to respond to domestic crises.165 It adapted a Tabletop Exercise, designed with the help of exercise officials at DHS and FEMA, to the law school environment. The Tabletop used one storyline to push on specific legal questions, as students, assigned roles in the discussion, sat around a table and for six hours engaged with the material.<br/>The problem with the Tabletop Exercise was that it was too static, and the <br/>AND<br/>focused on specific legal issues, even as it controlled for external chaos.<br/>The opportunity to provide a more full experience for the students came with the creation of first a one-day, and then a multi-day simulation. The course design and simulation continues to evolve. It offers a model for achieving the pedagogical goals outlined above, in the process developing a rigorous training ground for the next generation of national security lawyers.166<br/>A. Course Design<br/>The central idea in structuring the NSL Sim 2.0 course was to bridge <br/>AND<br/>and legal education) and flexible (responsive to student input and decisionmaking).<br/>Perhaps the most significant weakness in the use of any constructed universe is the problem <br/>AND<br/>student decisions themselves must drive the evolution of events within the simulation.168<br/>Additionally, while authenticity matters, it is worth noting that at some level the <br/>AND<br/>that would be much more difficult to do in a regular practice setting.<br/>NSL Sim 2.0 takes as its starting point the national security pedagogical goals discussed above. It works backwards to then engineer a classroom, cyber, and physical/simulation experience to delve into each of these areas. As a substantive matter, the course focuses on the constitutional, statutory, and regulatory authorities in national security law, placing particular focus on the interstices between black letter law and areas where the field is either unsettled or in flux.<br/>A key aspect of the course design is that it retains both the doctrinal and <br/>AND<br/>giving students the opportunity to develop depth and breadth prior to the exercise.<br/>In order to capture problems related to adaptation and evolution, addressing goal ~1<br/>AND<br/>Law to build the cyber portal used for NSL Sim 2.0.<br/>The twin goals of adaptation and evolution require that students be given a significant amount <br/>AND<br/>execution of the play, further developing their understanding of national security law.<br/>Throughout the simulation, the Control Team is constantly reacting to student choices. When unexpected decisions are made, professors may choose to pursue the evolution of the story to accomplish the pedagogical aims, or they may choose to cut off play in that area (there are various devices for doing so, such as denying requests, sending materials to labs to be analyzed, drawing the players back into the main storylines, and leaking information to the media).<br/>A total immersion simulation involves a number of scenarios, as well as systemic noise<br/>AND<br/>but to embrace them as part of the challenge facing national security lawyers.<br/>The simulation itself is problem-based, giving players agency in driving the evolution <br/>AND<br/>, generating in turn a set of new issues that must be addressed.<br/>The written and oral components of the simulation conform to the fourth pedagogical goal – <br/>AND<br/>simulation – and to deliver a 90 second oral briefing after the session.<br/>To replicate the high-stakes political environment at issue in goals (1) <br/>AND<br/>many different considerations that decisionmakers take into account in the national security domain.<br/>Scenarios are selected with high consequence events in mind, to ensure that students recognize <br/>AND<br/>to emphasize the broader political context within which national security law is practiced.<br/>Both anticipated and unanticipated decisions give rise to ethical questions and matters related to the <br/>AND<br/>exercise itself hitting the aim of the integration of the various pedagogical goals.<br/>Finally, there are multiple layers of feedback that players receive prior to, during<br/>AND<br/>, while another Control Team member may reject a FISC application as insufficient.<br/>The simulation goes beyond this, however, focusing on teaching students how to develop <br/>AND<br/>uncertainty, tension with colleagues, mistakes, and successes in the future.<br/>B. Substantive Areas: Interstices and Threats<br/>As a substantive matter, NSL Sim 2.0 is designed to take account <br/>AND<br/>weapons and pandemic disease also come within the doctrinal part of the course.<br/>The simulation itself is based on five to six storylines reflecting the interstices between different areas of the law. The storylines are used to present a coherent, non-linear scenario that can adapt to student responses. Each scenario is mapped out in a three to seven page document, which is then checked with scientists, government officials, and area experts for consistency with how the scenario would likely unfold in real life.<br/>For the biological weapons and pandemic disease emphasis, for example, one narrative might <br/>AND<br/>through press releases, weather updates, private communications, and the like.<br/>The five to six storylines, prepared by the Control Team in consultation with experts<br/>AND<br/>, giving the Control Team a birds-eye view of the progression.<br/>C. How It Works<br/>As for the nuts and bolts of the simulation itself, it traditionally begins outside of class, in the evening, on the grounds that national security crises often occur at inconvenient times and may well involve limited sleep and competing demands.171 Typically, a phone call from a Control Team member posing in a role integral to one of the main storylines, initiates play.<br/>Students at this point have been assigned dedicated simulation email addresses and provided access to <br/>AND<br/>relevant student teams. The Control Team has access to the complete site.<br/>For the next two (or three) days, outside of student initiatives (<br/>AND<br/>, or technology concerns, while setting the stage for the breaking crisis.<br/>The third (or fourth) day of play takes place entirely at Georgetown Law<br/>AND<br/>releases. Students use their own laptop computers for team decisions and communication.<br/>As the storylines unfold, the Control Team takes on a variety of roles, <br/>AND<br/>the simulation unfolded, and how the students performed in their various capacities.<br/>At the end of the day, the exercise terminates and an immediate hotwash is held, in which players are first debriefed on what occurred during the simulation. Because of the players’ divergent experiences and the different roles assigned to them, the students at this point are often unaware of the complete picture.

This play-it-safe strategy hinges on voters turning out in droves to voice their displeasure with President Obama’s health care law and his administration’s domestic-surveillance policies, among other things.<br/>But such an approach is unacceptable to the most conservative members of the House GOP. After two weeks of private deliberations, and fresh off a mini-retreat this week organized by the Republican Study Committee, conservatives are united in their resolve to make 2014 more about Republicans’ "bold, positive vision" and less about Obama’s failures.<br/>"I’m convinced Republicans have the best vision for America’s future," Rep. Kevin Brady of Texas said outside of Wednesday’s RSC meeting. "We’ve spent a lot of time opposing the president’s policies, but it’s time to share our vision if we want to win in November."<br/>That sentiment has echoed among conservative lawmakers all week, and it ramped up during <br/>AND<br/>reform plan, a welfare-reform package, and a privacy bill.<br/>"I don’t want to play prevent defense," Scalise said, according to members in attendance. "I want to play offense."<br/>Asked to explain the remark later in an interview, Scalise said, "Usually teams that play prevent defense lose the game."<br/>But Boehner’s team doesn’t share that view. GOP leadership has done everything possible in recent months to keep the electorate’s attention on the Democrats, especially highlighting the disastrous rollout of President Obama’s health care law and Republican oversight efforts on the IRS scandal and Benghazi attacks. Leadership officials are intent on keeping the American public "talking about Obamacare" all the way until November.<br/>Besides, already fewer than 90 work days remain in the legislative session. Even if leadership officials were to embrace an ambitious agenda, they see little time to implement it.<br/>"We have to do a budget, we have to do appropriations, we have to do debt ceiling. There are a lot of issues that are hanging out there that have to be done that dominate a lot of the calendar," said Rep. James Lankford, the Republican policy chairman and a member of leadership.<br/>That said, many of the conservatives’ policy objectives for 2014 are likely dead on arrival in Cambridge anyway.</p><p>No momentum and no vote – supporters admit <br/>Greg <strong>Sargent</strong>, Washington Post, <strong>1/15</strong>, "Push for Iran sanctions bill losing momentum?" www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2014/01/15/push-for-iran-sanctions-bill-losing-momentum/-<span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2014/01/15/push-for-iran-sanctions-bill-losing-momentum/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2014/01/15/push-for-iran-sanctions-bill-losing-momentum/%27" tppabs="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2014/01/15/push-for-iran-sanctions-bill-losing-momentum/"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2014/01/15/push-for-iran-sanctions-bill-losing-momentum/</span></a></span><br/> <br/>Harry Reid and Senate Dem leadership aides have been telling reporters that there are no plans for a vote on a new bill to impose sanctions on Iran — a vote the White House fears could derail diplomacy and make war more likely.<br/>Yet it may actually be even worse than this for proponents of the bill. Even Senators who support the measure are no longer pushing for any vote, and have no plans to do so for the foreseeable future, a Democratic Senator who favors the bill tells me.<br/>"At the moment, there’s no rush to put the bill on the floor," says this Senator, who asked for anonymity to be candid about the real state of play on the measure. "I’m not aware of any deadline in anyone’s head."<br/>It’s unclear whether any of the bill’s Democratic supporters are even privately pushing for a vote on it at this point, in the wake of the recent announcement that the six month deal curbing Iran’s nukes is set to move forward.<br/>One Senator who favors the bill — Richard Blumenthal — has publicly confirmed he’s having second thoughts in the wake of that announcement.<br/>And there is clearly more movement behind the scenes.

New sanctions would likely kill negotiations for a final deal, the White House warned lawmakers, and increase the chances of an armed conflict with Iran.<br/>But Senate majority leader Harry Reid has given no indication that he will bring the bill up for a vote, and the pressure to do so is falling now that top Democrats have intensified opposition to the proposed legislation.

But in light of the unresolved issues that must be addressed, it would be unwise to bet that events will unfold as planned. Unrealistic expectations about the Iran deal need to be revised downward.<br/>In Geneva on November 24, Iran and the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council—China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States—plus Germany agreed to a Joint Plan of Action. For good reason, the world welcomed this initial agreement because it squarely put Iran and the powers on a road to end the crisis through diplomacy.<br/>The deal calls for Tehran and the powers to negotiate the "final step" <br/>AND<br/>period of time.

If differences result in a stalemate, Iran’s hardliners could gain the upper hand, continue pursuing unfettered nuclear development, and eventually terminate the initial accord. Alternatively, U.S. lawmakers could respond to a lack of progress by adding to Iran’s sanctions burden, which would likewise doom the negotiation.

Analysis<br/>Under a restrictive interpretation of the U.N. Charter, Israel would not <br/>AND<br/>whether an Israeli preemptive strike would be acceptable under modern international law. n360</li><li>Customary International Law<br/>The Caroline doctrine, which underlies the customary international law analysis of anticipatory self-<br/>AND<br/>nuclear attack would meet the "necessity" requirement of the Caroline doctrine.<br/>Proportionality requires that action should not exceed what is minimally necessary to respond to a threat. n365 It would be in Israel’s diplomatic interests to respond with only the minimum required to avert the threat of nuclear attack. A preemptive strike that neutralizes Iran’s nuclear program and does not exceed the immediate threat to Israel to pursue "broader offensive or strategic goals" would satisfy the requirement of proportionality. n366<br/>With the assumption that an Israeli preemptive strike would meet both the necessity and proportionality <br/>AND<br/>and the 1981 Israeli attack on Osirak, which was uniformly condemned. n368<br/>As discussed in Part III.B, several threats were present in the &nbsp;~*<br/>AND<br/>that seem to meet the "imminence" requirement of customary international law.<br/>Israel, taken in the light most favorable to an argument for legitimacy, may <br/>AND<br/>appear to be any further corroborations of an intention to attack Israel. n371<br/>Developing nuclear weapons, because of their first-strike capabilities, may be tantamount <br/>AND<br/>only moderately resembles the threat posed by Egypt preceding the Six Day War.<br/>The present situation between Israel and Iran more closely resembles Israel’s attack on the Osirak <br/>AND<br/>an even stronger argument for an "imminent attack" by Iran today.<br/>The presence of these factors, without more, does not rise to the "<br/>AND<br/>weapons - should they come into Iran’s possession - against the Israeli state.<br/>While Israel may have a stronger argument for imminence today than it did in 1981, the present situation bears much stronger resemblance to the 1981 Osirak incident, where imminence was clearly not found, than to the 1967 Six Day War. As the Iranian threat against Israel does not rise to the imminence required by the Caroline doctrine, an Israeli preemptive strike against Iran would not be legal under customary international law.<br/>&nbsp;~*319~ <br/>2. Sadoff’s Framework<br/>The analytical framework proposed by David Sadoff offers an analysis of anticipatory self-defense <br/>AND<br/>be sufficiently imminent to justify an act of anticipatory self-defense. n378<br/>First, assessing the nature and scale of an Iranian nuclear attack is fairly straightforward. Israel fears facing the threat of "first strike" nuclear attack, which would leave little or no time for Israel to respond defensively once launched. n379 Israel would likely receive little to no warning of a nuclear launch. Such an attack could decimate the entirety of the Israeli state. The nature and scale of the threat is likely the gravest threat imaginable.<br/>The "likelihood" of the attack, however, is much more ambiguous. <br/>AND<br/>any intention to attack and does not presently have the capacity to attack.<br/>The third factor in gauging the threat, timing, is interspersed with the likelihood factor. Sadoff suggests similar questions for the assessment of these two components. n387 This seems appropriate. If an attack is not very likely to occur, then it is moot to consider whether the timing of an attack is sufficiently immediate to justify a pre-emptive strike.<br/>3. Considerations<br/>Under the analyses of both the customary international law and Sadoff’s frameworks, an Israeli <br/>AND<br/>Sadoff framework, using preemptive force to deter an attack would be justified.<br/>Also significant to the Caroline doctrine’s approach is that there are more options available to <br/>AND<br/>-defense where there is no actual imminence of a threatened attack. n394<br/>&nbsp;~*322~ &nbsp;Second, the rules that govern use of force must be <br/>AND<br/>that should bind, these laws lose their normative and prescriptive value. n395<br/>Expansive overhaul of the modern international legal order is not the solution. Customary international <br/>AND<br/>law to develop at a pace with which international consensus can keep up.<br/>Incorporating legitimacy into modern international law is a priority. Legitimacy ensures the general acceptance <br/>AND<br/>and non-state actors, including the nongovernmental organizations and the press.<br/>Furthermore, the international community needs predictability and transparency in modern international law to assure <br/>AND<br/>of force, which will result in predictability and transparency in future evaluations.<br/>Under both traditional and alternative analyses, Israel would not be presently justified to preemptively <br/>AND<br/>thus foiling the trigger that would lead the world into World War III.</li></ol><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h2 id="HSolvency-1" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Solvency</span></h2><h2 id="H2ACCircumvention" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>2AC Circumvention</span></h2><p>&nbsp;(No impact – separation of legal regimes solves even if Obama creates new zones)</p><p>No circumvention<br/>David J. <strong>Barron 8</strong>, Professor of Law at Harvard Law School and Martin S.

Johnston is an associate political scientist at the RAND Corporation, a nonprofit, nonpartisan research institution. He is the author of "Does Decapitation Work? Assessing the Effectiveness of Leadership Targeting in Counterinsurgency Campaigns," published in International Security (Spring 2012)., 8/22/2012, "Drone Strikes Keep Pressure on al-Qaida", www.rand.org/blog/2012/08/drone-strikes-keep-pressure-on-al-qaida.html)</p><p>Should the U.S. continue to strike at al-Qaida’s leadership with drone attacks? A recent poll shows that while most Americans approve of drone strikes, in 17 out of 20 countries, more than half of those surveyed disapprove of them.<br/>My study of leadership decapitation in 90 counter-insurgencies since the 1970s shows that when militant leaders are captured or killed militant attacks decrease, terrorist campaigns end sooner, and their outcomes tend to favor the government or third-party country, not the militants.<br/>Those opposed to drone strikes often cite the June 2009 one that targeted Pakistani Taliban <br/>AND<br/>cited drone strikes as a key motivation for his May 2010 attempted attack.<br/>Compared to manned aircraft, drones have some advantages as counter-insurgency tools, such as lower costs, longer endurance and the lack of a pilot to place in harm’s way and risk of capture. These characteristics can enable a more deliberative targeting process that serves to minimize unintentional casualties. But the weapons employed by drones are usually identical to those used via manned aircraft and can still kill civilians—creating enmity that breeds more terrorists.<br/>Yet many insurgents and terrorists have been taken off the battlefield by U.S. drones and special-operations forces. Besides Mehsud, the list includes Anwar al-Awlaki of al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula; al-Qaida deputy leader Abu Yahya al-Li-bi; and, of course, al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden. Given that list, it is possible that the drone program has prevented numerous attacks by their potential followers, like Shazad.<br/>What does the removal of al-Qaida leadership mean for U.S. national security? Though many in al-Qaida’s senior leadership cadre remain, the historical record suggests that "decapitation" will likely weaken the organization and could cripple its ability to conduct major attacks on the U.S. homeland.<br/>Killing terrorist leaders is not necessarily a knockout blow, but can make it harder for terrorists to attack the U.S. Members of al-Qaida’s central leadership, once safely amassed in northwestern Pakistan while America shifted its focus to Iraq, have been killed, captured, forced underground or scattered to various locations with little ability to communicate or move securely.<br/>Recently declassified correspondence seized in the bin Laden raid shows that the relentless pressure from the drone campaign on al-Qaida in Pakistan led bin Laden to advise al-Qaida operatives to leave Pakistan’s Tribal Areas as no longer safe. Bin Laden’s letters show that U.S. counterterrorism actions, which had forced him into self-imposed exile, had made running the organization not only more risky, but also more difficult.<br/>As al-Qaida members trickle out of Pakistan and seek sanctuary elsewhere, the U.S. military is ramping up its counterterrorism operations in Somalia and Yemen, while continuing its drone campaign in Pakistan. Despite its controversial nature, the U.S. counter-terrorism strategy has demonstrated a degree of effectiveness.<br/>The Obama administration is committed to reducing the size of the U.S. military’s footprint overseas by relying on drones, special operations forces, and other intelligence capabilities. These methods have made it more difficult for al-Qaida remnants to reconstitute a new safe haven, as Osama bin Laden did in Afghanistan in 1996, after his ouster from Sudan.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HDronesareoperationallyeffectiveandalternativesareworse2014establishingaclearstrikepolicysolvescriticism.-1" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Drones are operationally effective and alternatives are worse—establishing a clear strike policy solves criticism.</span></h4><p>Byman 13 (Daniel Byman, Brookings Institute Saban Center for Middle East Policy, Research Director, and Foreign Policy, Senior Fellow, July/Aug 2013, "Why Drones Work: The Case for the Washington’s Weapon of Choice", www.brookings.edu/research/articles/2013/06/17-drones-obama-weapon-choice-us-counterterrorism-byman)</p><p>Despite President Barack Obama’s recent call to reduce the United States’ reliance on drones, <br/>AND<br/>indiscriminately bomb civilian areas or use scorched-earth tactics against militant groups. <br/> <br/>Risk of nuclear terrorism is real and high now <br/>Bunn 13 (Matthew, Valentin Kuznetsov, Martin B.

CONTROLLING THE RECOURSE TO WAR BY MODIFYING JUS IN BELLO, Yearbook of International Humanitarian Law / Volume 12</p><p>A substantial literature exists on the conflation of jus ad bellum and jus in bello. However, the consequences for the former side of the equation – the resort to war – is generally under-examined. Instead, academic commentary has focused on the effects of compliance with humanitarian rules in armed conflict and, in particular, the equality of application principle. In this section, I attempt to help correct that imbalance.<br/>In the following analysis, I use the (admittedly provocative) short-hand labels of ’desirable’ and ’undesirable’ wars. The former consists of efforts that aim to promote the general welfare of foreign populations such as humanitarian interventions and, on some accounts, peacekeeping operations.

In our contemporary world of written instruments, the interaction of hard and soft law should be viewed in this light.<br/>With this background, we now turn to clarify the definition of hard and soft law, and elaborate the conventional depictions of their respective advantages and complementary interaction. We then turn to address the scope conditions under which states and other actors deploy hard and soft law as complements or antagonists, and the hypotheses derived from our theoretical framework.<br/>B. Defining Hard and Soft Law Along a Spectrum<br/>In our previous scholarship, we have demonstrated the complexities inherent in defining hard and <br/>AND<br/>illogical because law by definition cannot be "more or less binding."62<br/>In the world of practice, however, actors are faced not with a binary <br/>AND<br/>an agreement a "harder" or "softer" legal character.65<br/>Hard and soft law can thus be distinguished in terms of variation along a spectrum<br/>AND<br/>a "focal point" around which parties can reassess their positions.71<br/>Although some scholars have questioned this characterization of law in terms of these three attributes<br/>AND<br/>particularly useful for our analyses of how hard and soft law interact.74<br/>C.

It has since gone through multiple iterations.<br/>The initial concept followed on the federal full-scale Top Official ("TopOff") exercises, used to train government officials to respond to domestic crises.165 It adapted a Tabletop Exercise, designed with the help of exercise officials at DHS and FEMA, to the law school environment. The Tabletop used one storyline to push on specific legal questions, as students, assigned roles in the discussion, sat around a table and for six hours engaged with the material.<br/>The problem with the Tabletop Exercise was that it was too static, and the <br/>AND<br/>focused on specific legal issues, even as it controlled for external chaos.<br/>The opportunity to provide a more full experience for the students came with the creation of first a one-day, and then a multi-day simulation. The course design and simulation continues to evolve. It offers a model for achieving the pedagogical goals outlined above, in the process developing a rigorous training ground for the next generation of national security lawyers.166<br/>A. Course Design<br/>The central idea in structuring the NSL Sim 2.0 course was to bridge <br/>AND<br/>and legal education) and flexible (responsive to student input and decisionmaking).<br/>Perhaps the most significant weakness in the use of any constructed universe is the problem <br/>AND<br/>student decisions themselves must drive the evolution of events within the simulation.168<br/>Additionally, while authenticity matters, it is worth noting that at some level the <br/>AND<br/>that would be much more difficult to do in a regular practice setting.<br/>NSL Sim 2.0 takes as its starting point the national security pedagogical goals discussed above. It works backwards to then engineer a classroom, cyber, and physical/simulation experience to delve into each of these areas. As a substantive matter, the course focuses on the constitutional, statutory, and regulatory authorities in national security law, placing particular focus on the interstices between black letter law and areas where the field is either unsettled or in flux.<br/>A key aspect of the course design is that it retains both the doctrinal and <br/>AND<br/>giving students the opportunity to develop depth and breadth prior to the exercise.<br/>In order to capture problems related to adaptation and evolution, addressing goal ~1<br/>AND<br/>Law to build the cyber portal used for NSL Sim 2.0.<br/>The twin goals of adaptation and evolution require that students be given a significant amount <br/>AND<br/>execution of the play, further developing their understanding of national security law.<br/>Throughout the simulation, the Control Team is constantly reacting to student choices. When unexpected decisions are made, professors may choose to pursue the evolution of the story to accomplish the pedagogical aims, or they may choose to cut off play in that area (there are various devices for doing so, such as denying requests, sending materials to labs to be analyzed, drawing the players back into the main storylines, and leaking information to the media).<br/>A total immersion simulation involves a number of scenarios, as well as systemic noise<br/>AND<br/>but to embrace them as part of the challenge facing national security lawyers.<br/>The simulation itself is problem-based, giving players agency in driving the evolution <br/>AND<br/>, generating in turn a set of new issues that must be addressed.<br/>The written and oral components of the simulation conform to the fourth pedagogical goal – <br/>AND<br/>simulation – and to deliver a 90 second oral briefing after the session.<br/>To replicate the high-stakes political environment at issue in goals (1) <br/>AND<br/>many different considerations that decisionmakers take into account in the national security domain.<br/>Scenarios are selected with high consequence events in mind, to ensure that students recognize <br/>AND<br/>to emphasize the broader political context within which national security law is practiced.<br/>Both anticipated and unanticipated decisions give rise to ethical questions and matters related to the <br/>AND<br/>exercise itself hitting the aim of the integration of the various pedagogical goals.<br/>Finally, there are multiple layers of feedback that players receive prior to, during<br/>AND<br/>, while another Control Team member may reject a FISC application as insufficient.<br/>The simulation goes beyond this, however, focusing on teaching students how to develop <br/>AND<br/>uncertainty, tension with colleagues, mistakes, and successes in the future.<br/>B. Substantive Areas: Interstices and Threats<br/>As a substantive matter, NSL Sim 2.0 is designed to take account <br/>AND<br/>weapons and pandemic disease also come within the doctrinal part of the course.<br/>The simulation itself is based on five to six storylines reflecting the interstices between different areas of the law. The storylines are used to present a coherent, non-linear scenario that can adapt to student responses. Each scenario is mapped out in a three to seven page document, which is then checked with scientists, government officials, and area experts for consistency with how the scenario would likely unfold in real life.<br/>For the biological weapons and pandemic disease emphasis, for example, one narrative might <br/>AND<br/>through press releases, weather updates, private communications, and the like.<br/>The five to six storylines, prepared by the Control Team in consultation with experts<br/>AND<br/>, giving the Control Team a birds-eye view of the progression.<br/>C. How It Works<br/>As for the nuts and bolts of the simulation itself, it traditionally begins outside of class, in the evening, on the grounds that national security crises often occur at inconvenient times and may well involve limited sleep and competing demands.171 Typically, a phone call from a Control Team member posing in a role integral to one of the main storylines, initiates play.<br/>Students at this point have been assigned dedicated simulation email addresses and provided access to <br/>AND<br/>relevant student teams. The Control Team has access to the complete site.<br/>For the next two (or three) days, outside of student initiatives (<br/>AND<br/>, or technology concerns, while setting the stage for the breaking crisis.<br/>The third (or fourth) day of play takes place entirely at Georgetown Law<br/>AND<br/>releases. Students use their own laptop computers for team decisions and communication.<br/>As the storylines unfold, the Control Team takes on a variety of roles, <br/>AND<br/>the simulation unfolded, and how the students performed in their various capacities.<br/>At the end of the day, the exercise terminates and an immediate hotwash is held, in which players are first debriefed on what occurred during the simulation. Because of the players’ divergent experiences and the different roles assigned to them, the students at this point are often unaware of the complete picture. The judges and formal observers then offer reflections on the simulation and determine which teams performed most effectively.<br/>Over the next few classes, more details about the simulation emerge, as students <br/>AND<br/>opportunities for learning in the future. The course then formally ends.172 <br/>Learning, however, continues beyond the temporal confines of the semester. Students who <br/>AND<br/>concerns.

Assessing the Effectiveness of Leadership Targeting in Counterinsurgency Campaigns," published in International Security (Spring 2012)., 8/22/2012, "Drone Strikes Keep Pressure on al-Qaida", www.rand.org/blog/2012/08/drone-strikes-keep-pressure-on-al-qaida.html)</p><p>Should the U.S. continue to strike at al-Qaida's leadership with drone attacks? A recent poll shows that while most Americans approve of drone strikes, in 17 out of 20 countries, more than half of those surveyed disapprove of them.<br/>My study of leadership decapitation in 90 counter-insurgencies since the 1970s shows that when militant leaders are captured or killed militant attacks decrease, terrorist campaigns end sooner, and their outcomes tend to favor the government or third-party country, not the militants.<br/>Those opposed to drone strikes often cite the June 2009 one that targeted Pakistani Taliban <br/>AND<br/>cited drone strikes as a key motivation for his May 2010 attempted attack.<br/>Compared to manned aircraft, drones have some advantages as counter-insurgency tools, such as lower costs, longer endurance and the lack of a pilot to place in harm's way and risk of capture. These characteristics can enable a more deliberative targeting process that serves to minimize unintentional casualties. But the weapons employed by drones are usually identical to those used via manned aircraft and can still kill civilians—creating enmity that breeds more terrorists.<br/>Yet many insurgents and terrorists have been taken off the battlefield by U.S. drones and special-operations forces. Besides Mehsud, the list includes Anwar al-Awlaki of al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula; al-Qaida deputy leader Abu Yahya al-Li-bi; and, of course, al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden. Given that list, it is possible that the drone program has prevented numerous attacks by their potential followers, like Shazad.<br/>What does the removal of al-Qaida leadership mean for U.S. national security? Though many in al-Qaida's senior leadership cadre remain, the historical record suggests that "decapitation" will likely weaken the organization and could cripple its ability to conduct major attacks on the U.S. homeland.<br/>Killing terrorist leaders is not necessarily a knockout blow, but can make it harder for terrorists to attack the U.S. Members of al-Qaida's central leadership, once safely amassed in northwestern Pakistan while America shifted its focus to Iraq, have been killed, captured, forced underground or scattered to various locations with little ability to communicate or move securely.<br/>Recently declassified correspondence seized in the bin Laden raid shows that the relentless pressure from the drone campaign on al-Qaida in Pakistan led bin Laden to advise al-Qaida operatives to leave Pakistan's Tribal Areas as no longer safe. Bin Laden's letters show that U.S. counterterrorism actions, which had forced him into self-imposed exile, had made running the organization not only more risky, but also more difficult.<br/>As al-Qaida members trickle out of Pakistan and seek sanctuary elsewhere, the U.S. military is ramping up its counterterrorism operations in Somalia and Yemen, while continuing its drone campaign in Pakistan. Despite its controversial nature, the U.S. counter-terrorism strategy has demonstrated a degree of effectiveness.<br/>The Obama administration is committed to reducing the size of the U.S. military's footprint overseas by relying on drones, special operations forces, and other intelligence capabilities. These methods have made it more difficult for al-Qaida remnants to reconstitute a new safe haven, as Osama bin Laden did in Afghanistan in 1996, after his ouster from Sudan.</p><p>Drones are operationally effective and alternatives are worse—establishing a clear strike policy solves criticism. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>Byman 13 (Daniel Byman, Brookings Institute Saban Center for Middle East Policy, Research Director, and Foreign Policy, Senior Fellow, July/Aug 2013, “Why Drones Work: The Case for the Washington's Weapon of Choice”, www.brookings.edu/research/articles/2013/06/17-drones-obama-weapon-choice-us-counterterrorism-byman)</p><p>Despite President Barack Obama’s recent call to reduce the United States’ reliance on drones, <br/>AND<br/>indiscriminately bomb civilian areas or use scorched-earth tactics against militant groups. <br/> <br/>Risk of nuclear terrorism is real and high now <br/>Bunn 13 (Matthew, Valentin Kuznetsov, Martin B.

BELLO, Yearbook of International Humanitarian Law / Volume 12</p><p>A substantial literature exists on the conflation of jus ad bellum and jus in bello. However, the consequences for the former side of the equation – the resort to war – is generally under-examined. Instead, academic commentary has focused on the effects of compliance with humanitarian rules in armed conflict and, in particular, the equality of application principle. In this section, I attempt to help correct that imbalance.<br/>In the following analysis, I use the (admittedly provocative) short-hand labels of ‘desirable’ and ‘undesirable’ wars. The former consists of efforts that aim to promote the general welfare of foreign populations such as humanitarian interventions and, on some accounts, peacekeeping operations. The latter – undesirable wars – include conflicts that result from security spirals that serve neither state’s interest and also include predatory acts of aggression.<br/>4.1.1 Decreased likelihood of ‘desirable wars’<br/>A central question in debates about humanitarian intervention is whether the international community should be <br/>AND<br/>short, all ‘interventions to protect civilians from wholesale slaughter’ are affected.<br/>Two developments render desirable interventions less likely.

But with few exceptions, the targeting and firing decisions of armed robotic systems remain tightly under the control of human operators. This may soon change.<br/>Autonomous weapons are robotic systems that, once activated, can select and engage targets <br/>AND<br/>attack on an adversary’s strategic forces. Autonomous weapons may fight each other.<br/>Just as the emergence of low-cost, high-performance information technology has been the most important driver of technological advance over the past half-century—including the revolution in military affairs already seen in the 1980s and displayed to the world during the 1991 Gulf War—so the emergence of artificial intelligence and autonomous robotics will likely be the most important development in both civilian and military technology to unfold over the next few decades.<br/>Proponents of autonomous weapons argue that technology will gradually take over combat decision making: <br/>AND<br/>fast, and the factors involved are too complex for real human comprehension.”<br/>Almost nobody favors a future in which humans have lost control over war machines. <br/>AND<br/>would cheat on agreements.

This is known as the principle of proportionality.<br/>“Losing Humanity” argues that technical limitations mean robots could not reliably distinguish civilians <br/>AND<br/>from now are unknown and highly controversial within both expert and lay communities.<br/>While it may not satisfy the reified principle of distinction, proponents of autonomous weapons <br/>AND<br/>to persuade many people that their use in weapons is a net benefit.<br/>Judgment of proportionality seems at first an even greater challenge, and some argue that <br/>AND<br/>this would be to degrade human judgment almost to the level of machines.<br/>On the other hand, IBM’s Watson computer (Ferruci et al., 2010) <br/>AND<br/>decisions that most people would judge as reasonable, most of the time.<br/>“Losing Humanity” also argues that robots, necessarily lacking emotion,2 would be unable to empathize and thus unable to accurately interpret human behavior or be affected by compassion. An important case of the latter is when soldiers refuse orders to put down rebellions. Robots would be ideal tools of repression and dictatorship.<br/>If robot soldiers become available on the world market, it is likely that repressive <br/>AND<br/>hands of dictators, both by restricting their availability and stigmatizing their use.<br/>Accountability is another much-discussed issue. Clearly, a robot cannot be held <br/>AND<br/>since a robot cannot be punished, it cannot be a legal combatant.<br/>These are some of the issues most likely to be discussed within the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons. However, US Defense Department policy (2012) preemptively addresses many of these issues by directing that “autonomous and semi-autonomous weapon systems shall be designed to allow commanders and operators to exercise appropriate levels of human judgment over the use of force.”<br/>Under the US policy, commanders and operators are responsible for using autonomous weapons in <br/>AND<br/>-approves the immediate development, acquisition, and use of such weapons.<br/>Although the policy does not define “appropriate levels,” it applies this rubric even <br/>AND<br/>it to individual states to determine what levels of human judgment are appropriate.<br/>Demanding human control and responsibility<br/>As diplomatic discussions about killer robot regulation get under way, a good deal of time is apt to be lost in confusion about terms, definitions, and scope. “Losing Humanity” seeks to ban “fully autonomous weapons,” and Heyns’s report used the term “lethal autonomous robotics.” The US policy directive speaks of “autonomous and semi-autonomous weapon systems,” and the distinction between these is ambiguous (Gubrud, 2013). The Geneva mandate is to discuss “lethal autonomous weapon systems.”<br/>Substantive questions include whether non-lethal weapons and those that target only matériel are within the scope of discussion. Legacy weapons such as simple mines may be regarded as autonomous, or distinguished as merely automatic, on grounds that their behavior is fully predictable by designers.3 Human-supervised autonomous and semi-autonomous weapon systems, as defined by the United States, raise issues that, like fractal shapes, appear more complex the more closely they are examined.<br/>Instead of arguing about how to define what weapons should be banned, it may <br/>AND<br/>and a human has determined that it is an appropriate and legal target.<br/>A second principle is that a human commander must be responsible and accountable for the decision, and if the commander acts through another person who operates a weapon system, that person must be responsible and accountable for maintaining control of the system. “Responsible” refers here to a moral and legal obligation, and “accountable” refers to a formal system for accounting of actions. Both elements are essential to the approach.<br/>Responsibility implies that commanders and operators may not blame inadequacies of technological systems for any <br/>AND<br/>to prevent unintended engagements, the operator must refuse to operate the system.<br/>Accountability can be demonstrated by states that comply with this principle. They need only maintain records showing that each engagement was properly authorized and executed. If a violation is alleged, selected records can be unsealed in a closed inquiry conducted by an international body (Gubrud and Altmann, 2013).4<br/>This framing, which focuses on human control and responsibility for the decision to use violent force, is both conceptually simple and morally compelling. What remains then is to set standards for adequate information to be presented to commanders, and to require positive action by operators of a weapon system. Those standards should also address any circumstances under which other parties—designers and manufacturers, for instance—might be held responsible for an unintended engagement.<br/>There is at least one exceptional circumstance in which human control may be applied less <br/>AND<br/>be delayed as long as possible to allow time for an override decision.<br/>The strategic need for robot arms control<br/>Principles of humanity may be the strongest foundation for an effective ban of autonomous weapons, but they are not necessarily the most compelling reason why a ban must be sought. The perceived military advantages of autonomy are so great that major powers are likely to strongly resist prohibition, but by the same token, autonomous weapons pose a severe threat to global peace and security.<br/>Although humans have (for now) superior capabilities for perception in complex environments and <br/>AND<br/>expensive, and their replacement by robots is expected to yield cost savings.<br/>While today’s relatively sparse use of drones, in undefended airspace, to target irregular <br/>AND<br/>the use of sea-based drones to attack targets inland as well.<br/>In a cold war, small robots could be used for covert infiltration, surveillance<br/>AND<br/>nuclear-capable and potentially unmanned, which would almost certainly mean autonomous.<br/>There can be no real game-changers in the nuclear stalemate. Yet the <br/>AND<br/>race would be global in scope, as the drone race already is.<br/>Since robots are regarded as expendable, they may be risked in provocative adventures. Recently, China has warned that if Japan makes good on threats to shoot down Chinese drones that approach disputed islands, it could be regarded as an act of war. Similarly, forward-basing of missile interceptors (Lewis and Postol, 2010) or other strategic weapons on unmanned platforms would risk misinterpretation as a signal of imminent attack, and could invite preemption.<br/>Engineering the stability of a robot confrontation would be a wickedly hard problem even for <br/>AND<br/>speed, the potential for events to spiral out of control is obvious.<br/>The way out<br/>Given the military significance of autonomous weapons, substantial pressure from civil society will be needed before the major powers will seriously consider accepting hard limits, let alone prohibition.

Deputy Defense Secretary William Lynn, in a speech in New York last month, promised the report would be driven by current Afghanistan and Iraq war needs, placing an emphasis on ground troops and counterinsurgency operations and less on the modernization of weapons systems.<br/>If that proves to be the case, it would amount to a Pentagon about-face since the last QDR, released in 2006, which had a rather short shelf life. The last edition was replete with proposals for spending on a laundry list of military modernization programs, much of which were to be scrapped or scaled back after the Department of Defense decided a year later to increase ground troop strength and emphasize counterinsurgency operations.<br/>The fiasco associated with the last QDR may be explainable, at least in part, on the change of leadership at the Pentagon. Donald Rumsfeld was pushed out as secretary of defense and his replacement, Robert Gates, who continues to serve in the Obama administration after having been appointed by George W Bush, emphasized planning for the wars the US was actually fighting instead the wars Rumsfeld would have liked the US to be fighting.<br/>Somewhere between strategy and reality<br/>But observers fret that a gap between strategy and reality has become embedded in the QDR process, and that the 2010 edition will be no different.<br/>The QDR was instituted in the late 1990s with the admirable purpose of institutionalizing strategic thinking among Department of Defense echelons.<br/>"QDRs help Secretaries of Defense to set out their strategic vision for the department, and better align the military posture with the strategy," Jim Thomas, vice president for strategic studies at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a non-partisan Washington think tank, told ISN Security Watch. But "the results of QDRs have been mixed."<br/>Why? "Past QDRs have generally done a better job of articulating strategic approaches than aligning the military posture - investments, force structure, basing - with the strategy," Thomas explained. "There are powerful institutional forces in the military, Congress and industry supporting status quo investment programs and force structures, but there are rarely strong countervailing forces for new program starts or developing new types of forces."<br/>Indeed, there is a school of thought that believes that the QDR as a strategic planning tool is doomed to failure.<br/>A report recently released by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a bipartisan Washington think tank, concluded that the goals of the QDR - to serve as a means to develop new policies, capabilities and initiatives - "have so far been unrealized." The report is less than optimistic that the 2010 QDR will turn things around.<br/>"The issues the QDR must address have been greatly complicated by the Department of Defense’s past failures to develop effective plans, programs, and budgets; carry out effective systems analysis; develop credible cost estimates; and create timely and meaningful future year defense plans," the report said.<br/>"Past reviews have been decoupled from meaningful budget figures, realistic force plans, honest procurement decisions, and metrics to measure the success of their recommendations.

If problems with the health-care law continue, you will start to hear Democrats from states in which Obama is unpopular distance themselves even more from him.<br/>If the law’s image improves, you will hear less of that.

Not toys or models, but real flying machines.<br/>It’s a classic and common phase in the life cycle of a military innovation: <br/>AND<br/>the United States; it’s a precedent Washington does not want anyone following.<br/>America, the world’s leading democracy and a country built on a legal and moral framework unlike any other, has adopted a war-making process that too often bypasses its traditional, regimented, and rigorously overseen military in favor of a secret program never publicly discussed, based on legal advice never properly vetted. The Obama administration has used its executive power to refuse or outright ignore requests by congressional overseers, and it has resisted monitoring by federal courts.<br/>To implement this covert program, the administration has adopted a tool that lowers the <br/>AND<br/>-states involved but also destabilize entire regions and potentially upset geopolitical order.<br/>Hyperbole? Consider this: Iran, with the approval of Damascus, carries out <br/>AND<br/>learned it by watching you. In Pakistan, Yemen, and Afghanistan.<br/>This is the unintended consequence of American drone warfare. For all of the attention <br/>AND<br/>uses of one of the most awesome military robotics capabilities of this generation.<br/>THE WRONG QUESTION <br/>The United States is the indisputable leader in drone technology and long-range strike<br/>AND<br/>billions of dollars that have gone into establishing and maintaining such a capability.<br/>That level of superiority leads some national security officials to downplay concerns about other nations’ <br/>AND<br/>the unparalleled intelligence-collection and data-analysis underpinning the aircraft’s mission.<br/>"There is what I think is just an unconstrained focus on a tool as <br/>AND<br/>who are interpreting the information that’s coming off the sensors on the aircraft."<br/>The analysts are part of the global architecture that makes precision strikes, and targeted <br/>AND<br/>) outweigh the reward (judged by the value of the threat eliminated).<br/>"Is that a shovel or a rifle? Is that a Taliban member or <br/>AND<br/>. We can orbit long enough to be pretty sure about our target."<br/>Other countries, groups, and even individuals can and do fly drones. But no state or group has nearly the sophisticated network of intelligence and data analysis that gives the United States its strategic advantage. Although it would be foolish to dismiss the notion that potential U.S. adversaries aspire to attain that type of war-from-afar, pinpoint-strike capability, they have neither the income nor the perceived need to do so.<br/>That’s true, at least today. It’s also irrelevant. Others who employ drones are likely to carry a different agenda, one more concerned with employing a relatively inexpensive and ruthlessly efficient tool to dispatch an enemy close at hand.<br/>"It would be very difficult for them to create the global-strike architecture <br/>AND<br/>long-duration surveillance and potentially strike inside and right on its border."<br/>And that’s a NATO ally seeking the capability to conduct missions that would run afoul <br/>AND<br/>uses the aircraft to strike Lashkar-e-Taiba militants near Kashmir?<br/>"We don’t like other states using lethal force outside their borders. It’s destabilizing. It can lead to a sort of wider escalation of violence between two states," said Micah Zenko, a security policy and drone expert at the Council on Foreign Relations. "So the proliferation of drones is not just about the protection of the United States. It’s primarily about the likelihood that other states will increasingly use lethal force outside of their borders."<br/>LOWERING THE BAR<br/>Governments have covertly killed for ages, whether they maintained an official hit list or <br/>AND<br/>American security experts point to Russia as well, although Moscow disputes this.<br/>In the 1960s, the U.S. government was involved to differing levels <br/>AND<br/>late as 2001, Washington’s stated policy was to oppose Israel’s targeted killings.)<br/>When America adopted targeted killing again—first under the Bush administration after the September 11 attacks and then expanded by President Obama—the tools of the trade had changed. No longer was the CIA sending poison, pistols, and toxic cigars to assets overseas to kill enemy leaders. Now it could target people throughout al-Qaida’s hierarchy with accuracy, deliver lethal ordnance literally around the world, and watch the mission’s completion in real time.<br/>The United States is smartly using technology to improve combat efficacy, and to make <br/>AND<br/>, defense hawks and spendthrifts alike would criticize it if it did not.<br/>"If you believe that these folks are legitimate terrorists who are committing acts of <br/>AND<br/>Do we have the debate if an aircraft pilot drops a particular bomb?"<br/>But defense analysts argue—and military officials concede—there is a qualitative difference <br/>AND<br/>States would not have pursued an equivalent number of manned strikes in Pakistan.<br/>And what’s true for the United States will be true as well for other countries that own and arm remote piloted aircraft.<br/>"The drones—the responsiveness, the persistence, and without putting your personnel at risk—is what makes it a different technology," Zenko said. "When other states have this technology, if they follow U.S. practice, it will lower the threshold for their uses of lethal force outside their borders. So they will be more likely to conduct targeted killings than they have in the past."<br/>The Obama administration appears to be aware of and concerned about setting precedents through its targeted-strike program. When the development of a disposition matrix to catalog both targets and resources marshaled against the United States was first reported in 2012, officials spoke about it in part as an effort to create a standardized process that would live beyond the current administration, underscoring the long duration of the counterterrorism challenge.<br/>Indeed, the president’s legal and security advisers have put considerable effort into establishing rules <br/>AND<br/>lead somebody to be subject for an engagement by the United States government."<br/>BEHIND CLOSED DOORS<br/>The argument against public debate is easy enough to understand: Operational secrecy is necessary<br/>AND<br/>public debate, which is going to be a hard one to win."<br/>But by keeping legal and policy positions secret, only partially sharing information even with congressional oversight committees, and declining to open a public discussion about drone use, the president and his team are asking the world to just trust that America is getting this right. While some will, many people, especially outside the United States, will see that approach as hypocritical, coming from a government that calls for transparency and the rule of law elsewhere.<br/>"I know these people, and I know how much they really, really <br/>AND<br/>would be giving you a different rendering, and much more uncertain rendering."<br/>That’s only part of the problem with the White House’s trust-us approach. <br/>AND<br/>) an imminent threat of violent attack 5) against the United States.<br/>But that’s not who is being targeted.<br/>Setting aside the administration’s redefining of "imminence" beyond all recognition, the majority <br/>AND<br/>States (another precedent that might be eagerly seized upon in the future).<br/>U.S. defense and intelligence officials reject any suggestion that the targets are <br/>AND<br/>new Secretary of State John Kerry criticized during his confirmation hearing this year.<br/>Human-rights groups might be loudest in their criticism of both the program and <br/>AND<br/>by principles and rules of the Constitution and of the Bill of Rights."<br/>PEER PRESSURE<br/>Obama promised in his 2013 State of the Union to increase the drone program’s transparency<br/>AND<br/>of the legal memos the Justice Department drafted in support of targeted killing.<br/>But, beyond that, it’s not certain Obama will do anything more to shine light on this program. Except in situations where leaks help it tell a politically expedient story of its skill at killing bad guys, the administration has done little to make a case to the public and the world at large for its use of armed drones.<br/>Already, what’s become apparent is that the White House is not interested in changing <br/>AND<br/>largely off the table now, according to intelligence officials and committee members.<br/>Under discussion within the administration and on Capitol Hill is a potential program takeover by <br/>AND<br/>provide no guarantee of greater transparency for the public, or even Congress.<br/>And if the administration is not willing to share with lawmakers who are security-cleared to know, it certainly is not prepared to engage in a sensitive discussion, even among allies, that might begin to set the rules on use for a technology that could upend stability in already fragile and strategically significant places around the globe. Time is running out to do so.<br/>"The history of technology development like this is, you never maintain your lead very long. Somebody always gets it," said David Berteau, director of the International Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "They’re going to become cheaper. They’re going to become easier. They’re going to become interoperable," he said. "The destabilizing effects are very, very serious."<br/>Berteau is not alone. Zenko, of the Council on Foreign Relations, has <br/>AND<br/>angles on this question are why you see them in conflict right now."<br/>That’s in part a symptom of the "technological optimism" that often plagues the U.S. security community when it establishes a lead over its competitors, noted Georgetown University’s Kai-Henrik Barth. After the 1945 bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the United States was sure it would be decades before the Soviets developed a nuclear-weapon capability. It took four years.<br/>With drones, the question is how long before the dozens of states with the <br/>AND<br/>nations have gone down the pathway of first only surveillance and then arming."<br/>The opportunity to write rules that might at least guide, if not restrain, <br/>AND<br/>—to be closer to certain that their target is the right one.<br/>But even without raising standards, tightening up drone-specific restrictions in the standing <br/>AND<br/>, or 15 years—might find helpful in arguing against another’s actions.<br/>A not-insignificant faction of U.S. defense and intelligence experts, <br/>AND<br/>some weapons, including land mines, blinding lasers, and nuclear bombs.<br/>Arguably more significant than spotty legal regimes, however, is the behavior of the <br/>AND<br/>policy that it did most recently on "enhanced interrogation" of terrorists.<br/>The case against open, transparent rule-making is that it might only hamstring <br/>AND<br/>operations manual for other nations but a legal and moral one as well.</p><p>Geographic restrictions are key<br/>Rosa Brooks, Professor of Law, Georgetown University Law Center, Bernard L.

The Rule of Law <br/>At root, the idea of "rule of law" is fairly simple, <br/>AND<br/>processes and rules that reflect basic notions of justice, humanity and fairness.<br/>Precisely what constitutes a fair process is debatable, but most would agree that at <br/>AND<br/>Civil and Political Rights, to which the United States is a party.<br/>In ordinary circumstances, this bundle of universally acknowledged rights (together with international law <br/>AND<br/>States government called this an act of murder—an unlawful political assassination.<br/>B. Targeted Killing and the Law of Armed Conflict<br/>Of course, sometimes the "ordinary" legal rules do not apply. In <br/>AND<br/>the principles of necessity, humanity, proportionality,29 and distinction.30<br/>It is worth briefly explaining these principles. The principle of necessity requires parties to <br/>AND<br/>in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage expected to be gained.<br/>Finally, the principle of discrimination or distinction requires that parties to a conflict direct their actions only against combatants and military objectives, and take appropriate steps to distinguish between combatants and non-combatants.31<br/>This is a radical oversimplification of a very complex body of law.32 But <br/>AND<br/>by military necessity34 — but there are far fewer constraints on state behavior.<br/>Technically, the law of war is referred to using the Latin term "lex specialis" – special law. It is applicable in—and only in — special circumstances (in this case, armed conflict), and in those special circumstances, it supersedes "ordinary law," or "lex generalis," the "general law" that prevails in peacetime. We have one set of laws for "normal" situations, and another, more flexible set of laws for "extraordinary" situations, such as armed conflicts.<br/>None of this poses any inherent problem for the rule of law. Having one body of rules that tightly restricts the use of force and another body of rules that is far more permissive does not fundamentally undermine the rule of law, as long as we have a reasonable degree of consensus on what circumstances trigger the "special" law, and as long as the "special law" doesn’t end up undermining the general law.<br/>To put it a little differently, war, with its very different rules, <br/>AND<br/>, and between places where there’s war and places where there’s no war.<br/>Let me return now to the question of drones and targeted killings. When all <br/>AND<br/>Libyan military targets is no more controversial than the use of manned aircraft.<br/>That is because our core rule of law concerns have mostly been satisfied: we <br/>AND<br/>in the event of error or abuse (the various governments involved).35<br/>Once you take targeted killings outside hot battlefields, it’s a different story. The <br/>AND<br/>any time — with regard to any person the administration deems a combatant.<br/>The trouble is, no one outside a very small group within the US executive <br/>AND<br/>of the time, the US will not even officially acknowledge targeted killings.<br/>This leaves all the key rule-of-law questions related to the ongoing <br/>AND<br/>determinations, and what is the precise chain of command for such decisions?<br/>I think the rule of law problem here is obvious: when "armed conflict<br/>AND<br/>are they, as some human rights groups have argued, unlawful murder?<br/>C. Targeted Killing and the International Law of Self-Defense <br/>When faced with criticisms of the law of war framework as a justification for targeted <br/>AND<br/>that the defensive force used is otherwise consistent with law of war principles.<br/>Like law of war-based arguments, this general principle is superficially uncontroversial: if someone overseas is about to launch a nuclear weapon at New York City, no one can doubt that the United States has a perfect right (and the president has a constitutional duty) to use force if needed to prevent that attack, regardless of the attacker’s nationality.<br/>But once again, the devil is in the details. To start with, what constitutes an "imminent" threat? Traditionally, both international law and domestic criminal law understand that term narrowly: 37 to be "imminent," a threat cannot be distant or speculative.38 But much like the Bush Administration before it, the Obama Administration has put forward an interpretation of the word "imminent" that bears little relation to traditional legal concepts.<br/>According to a leaked 2011 Justice Department white paper39—the most detailed legal justification that has yet become public— the requirement of imminence "does not require the United States to have clear evidence that a specific attack on U.S. persons and interests will take place in the immediate future." This seems, in itself, like a substantial departure from accepted international law definitions of imminence.<br/>But the White Paper goes even further, stating that "certain members of al <br/>AND<br/>identity or status (a familiar part of the law of armed conflict).<br/>That concept of imminence has been called Orwellian, and although that is an overused epithet, in this context it seems fairly appropriate. According to the Obama Administration, "imminent" no longer means "immediate," and in fact the very absence of clear evidence indicating specific present or future attack plans becomes, paradoxically, the basis for assuming that attack may perpetually be "imminent."<br/>The 2011 Justice Department White Paper notes that the use of force in self-defense must comply with general law of war principles of necessity, proportionality, humanity, and distinction. The White Paper offers no guidance on the specific criteria for determining when an individual is a combatant (or a civilian participating directly in hostilities), however. It also offers no guidance on how to determine if a use of force is necessary or proportionate.<br/>From a traditional international law perspective, this necessity and proportionality inquiry relates both to <br/>AND<br/>American citizen abroad — or against non-citizens, for that matter?<br/>As I have noted, it is impossible for outsiders to fully evaluate US drone strikes, since so much vital information remains classified. In most cases, we know little about the identities; activities or future plans of those targeted. Nevertheless, given the increased frequency of US targeted killings in recent years, it seems reasonable to wonder whether the Administration conducts a rigorous necessity or proportionality analysis in all cases.<br/>So far, the leaked 2011 Justice Department White Paper represents the most detailed legal <br/>AND<br/>citizens are less exacting than those the Administration views as applicable to citizens.<br/>Defenders of administration targeted killing policy acknowledge that the criteria for determining how to answer these many questions have not been made public, but insist that this should not be cause for concern. The Administration has reportedly developed a detailed "playbook" outlining the targeting criteria and procedures,40, and insiders insist that executive branch officials go through an elaborate process in which they carefully consider every possible issue before determining that a drone strike is lawful.41<br/>No doubt they do, but this is somewhat cold comfort. Formal processes tend to further normalize once-exceptional activities — and "trust us" is a rather shaky foundation for the rule of law. Indeed, the whole point of the rule of law is that individual lives and freedom should not depend solely on the good faith and benevolence of government officials.<br/>As with law of war arguments, stating that US targeted killings are clearly legal under traditional self-defense principles requires some significant cognitive dissonance. Law exists to restrain untrammeled power. It is no doubt possible to make a plausible legal argument justifying each and every U.S. drone strike — but this merely suggests that we are working with a legal framework that has begun to outlive its usefulness.<br/>The real question isn’t whether U.S. drone strikes are "legal." The real question is this: Do we really want to live in a world in which the U.S. government’s justification for killing is so malleable?<br/>5. Setting Troubling International Precedents<br/>Here is an additional reason to worry about the U.S. overreliance on <br/>AND<br/>human rights records, such as Russia and China—are taking notice.<br/>Right now, the United States has a decided technological advantage when it comes to <br/>AND<br/>for how to foment instability and –literally — get away with murder.<br/>Take the issue of sovereignty. Sovereignty has long been a core concept of the <br/>AND<br/>or in self-defense "in the event of an armed attack."<br/>The 2011 Justice Department White Paper asserts that targeted killings carried out by the United <br/>AND<br/>unable" to suppress that threat, the logic is in fact circular.<br/>It goes like this: The United States — using its own malleable definition of <br/>AND<br/>posed by Person X and the use of force again presents no problem.<br/>This is a legal theory that more or less eviscerates traditional notions of sovereignty, <br/>AND<br/>them to justify the killing of dissidents, rivals, or unwanted minorities?</p><p>Collapse of zone of conflict clarity results in escalatory war and miscalaculation<br/><strong>Dean 13</strong><br/>Adriana Dean, University of Southern California in Philosophy, Politics and Law, 2013, Targeted Killings Behind the Veil of Ignorance, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.academia.edu/3832442/Targeted_Killings_Behind_the_Veil_of_Ignorance  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.academia.edu/3832442/Targeted_Killings_Behind_the_Veil_of_Ignorance%27" tppabs="http://www.academia.edu/3832442/Targeted_Killings_Behind_the_Veil_of_Ignorance"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.academia.edu/3832442/Targeted_Killings_Behind_the_Veil_of_Ignorance</span></a></span></p><p>While there are some justifiable points for the targeted killing program that individuals behind the <br/>AND<br/>that certain components and the resulting implications of the program are categorically unfair.&nbsp;</p><p>Those conflicts go nuclear<br/>Michael J <strong>Boyle 13</strong>, Assistant Professor of Political Science at La Salle University, former Lecturer in International Relations and Research Fellow at the Centre for the Study of Terrorism and Political Violence at the University of St Andrews, PhD from Cambridge University, January 2013, "The costs and consequences of drone warfare," International Affairs 89: 1 (2013) 1–29, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/public/International20Affairs/2013/89_1/89_1Boyle.pdf  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/public/International20Affairs/2013/89_1/89_1Boyle.pdf%27" tppabs="http://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/public/International20Affairs/2013/89_1/89_1Boyle.pdf"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/public/International20Affairs/2013/89_1/89_1Boyle.pdf</span></a></span></p><p>A second consequence of the spread of drones is that many of the traditional concepts <br/>AND<br/>powers, thus magnifying the risks of a spiral of conflict between them.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>Turkey follows US precedent to strike the PKK – collapses negotiations and Erdogan’s presidency <br/>Stein 13 (Aaron, Ph.D candidate at King’s College, London and the Nonproliferation Program Director at the Center for Economics and Foreign Policy Studies an independent think tank in Istanbul, "Turkey’s Negotiations with the Kurdistan Workers’ Party and Armed Drones" February 26, 2013, Turkey Wonk Blog)</p><p>Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has recently re-intiated peace talks with Abdullah Ocalan <br/>AND<br/>backlash from Turkish nationalists (An important AKP voting bloc by the way).<br/>The talks, despite having made some progress, broke down after President Abdullah Gul <br/>AND<br/>end of the talks and the re-militarization of the Kurdish issue.<br/>This time around, Erdogan has opted to publicize the talks, which has, <br/>AND<br/>Union reforms and deepening the country’s democratic system (Both AKP campaign themes).<br/>Erdogan, I am assuming, is betting that if he solves the PKK problem<br/>AND<br/>the recent attack, see this blog post by the excellent Frederike Geerdink).<br/>The AKP, however, receives a tremendous amount of political support from nationalists. <br/>AND<br/>penalty and the need to open chapters for Turkey’s stalled European Union bid.<br/>However, because the AKP has shown an incredible ability to set Turkey’s political agenda – using coordinated leaks, trial balloons, and speeches, which are framed by overarching themes like justice and development (The translation of the AKP’s name) – I believe that the AKP is capable of keeping its coalition together and ending the conflict with the PKK.

It also could elevate the threat to neighbors with territorial disputes with Beijing, including Vietnam, Japan, India and the Philippines. China says its drones are capable of carrying bombs and missiles as well as conducting reconnaissance, potentially turning them into offensive weapons in a border conflict.<br/>China’s increased use of drones also adds to concerns about the lack of internationally recognized standards for drone attacks. The United States has widely employed drones as a means of eliminating terror suspects in Pakistan and the Arabian Peninsula.<br/>"China is following the precedent set by the U.S. The thinking is that, `If the U.S. can do it, so can we. They’re a big country with security interests and so are we’," said Siemon Wezeman, a senior fellow at the arms transfers program at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute in Sweden, or SIPRI.<br/>"The justification for an attack would be that Beijing too has a responsibility for the safety of its citizens. There needs to be agreement on what the limits are," he said.<br/>Though China claims its military posture is entirely defensive, its navy and civilian maritime services have engaged in repeated standoffs with ships from other nations in the South China and East China seas. India, meanwhile, says Chinese troops have set up camp almost 20 kilometers (12 miles) into Indian-claimed territory.<br/>It isn’t yet known exactly what China’s latest drones are capable of, because, like most Chinese equipment, they remain untested in battle.<br/>The military and associated aerospace firms have offered little information, although in an interview last month with the official Xinhua News Agency, Yang Baikui, chief designer at plane maker COSIC, said Chinese drones were closing the gap but still needed to progress in half a dozen major areas, from airframe design to digital linkups.<br/>Executives at COSIC and drone makers ASN, Avic, and the 611 Institute declined to be interviewed by The Associated Press, citing their military links. The Defense Ministry’s latest report on the status of the military released in mid-April made no mention of drones, and spokesman Yang Yujun made only the barest acknowledgement of their existence in response to a question.<br/>"Drones are a new high-tech form of weaponry employed and used by many militaries around the world," Yang said. "China’s armed forces are developing weaponry and equipment for the purpose of upholding territorial integrity, national security and world peace. It will pose no threat to any country."<br/>Drones are already patrolling China’s borders, and a navy drone was deployed to the western province of Sichuan to provide aerial surveillance following last month’s deadly earthquake there.<br/>They may also soon be appearing over China’s maritime claims, including Japanese-controlled East China Sea islands that China considers its own.

Introduction In 2011, Harvard’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs and <br/>AND<br/>the intention to acquire and use nuclear weapons is as strong as ever.</p><p>Drones solve safe havens – prevents an attack in the US<br/><strong>Johnston 12</strong> (Patrick B. Johnston is an associate political scientist at the RAND Corporation, a nonprofit, nonpartisan research institution. He is the author of "Does Decapitation Work? Assessing the Effectiveness of Leadership Targeting in Counterinsurgency Campaigns," published in International Security (Spring 2012)., 8/22/2012, "Drone Strikes Keep Pressure on al-Qaida", www.rand.org/blog/2012/08/drone-strikes-keep-pressure-on-al-qaida.html)</p><p>Should the U.S. continue to strike at al-Qaida’s leadership with drone attacks? A recent poll shows that while most Americans approve of drone strikes, in 17 out of 20 countries, more than half of those surveyed disapprove of them.<br/>My study of leadership decapitation in 90 counter-insurgencies since the 1970s shows that when militant leaders are captured or killed militant attacks decrease, terrorist campaigns end sooner, and their outcomes tend to favor the government or third-party country, not the militants.<br/>Those opposed to drone strikes often cite the June 2009 one that targeted Pakistani Taliban <br/>AND<br/>cited drone strikes as a key motivation for his May 2010 attempted attack.<br/>Compared to manned aircraft, drones have some advantages as counter-insurgency tools, such as lower costs, longer endurance and the lack of a pilot to place in harm’s way and risk of capture. These characteristics can enable a more deliberative targeting process that serves to minimize unintentional casualties. But the weapons employed by drones are usually identical to those used via manned aircraft and can still kill civilians—creating enmity that breeds more terrorists.<br/>Yet many insurgents and terrorists have been taken off the battlefield by U.S. drones and special-operations forces. Besides Mehsud, the list includes Anwar al-Awlaki of al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula; al-Qaida deputy leader Abu Yahya al-Li-bi; and, of course, al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden. Given that list, it is possible that the drone program has prevented numerous attacks by their potential followers, like Shazad.<br/>What does the removal of al-Qaida leadership mean for U.S. national security? Though many in al-Qaida’s senior leadership cadre remain, the historical record suggests that "decapitation" will likely weaken the organization and could cripple its ability to conduct major attacks on the U.S. homeland.<br/>Killing terrorist leaders is not necessarily a knockout blow, but can make it harder for terrorists to attack the U.S. Members of al-Qaida’s central leadership, once safely amassed in northwestern Pakistan while America shifted its focus to Iraq, have been killed, captured, forced underground or scattered to various locations with little ability to communicate or move securely.<br/>Recently declassified correspondence seized in the bin Laden raid shows that the relentless pressure from the drone campaign on al-Qaida in Pakistan led bin Laden to advise al-Qaida operatives to leave Pakistan’s Tribal Areas as no longer safe. Bin Laden’s letters show that U.S. counterterrorism actions, which had forced him into self-imposed exile, had made running the organization not only more risky, but also more difficult.<br/>As al-Qaida members trickle out of Pakistan and seek sanctuary elsewhere, the U.S. military is ramping up its counterterrorism operations in Somalia and Yemen, while continuing its drone campaign in Pakistan. Despite its controversial nature, the U.S. counter-terrorism strategy has demonstrated a degree of effectiveness.<br/>The Obama administration is committed to reducing the size of the U.S. military’s footprint overseas by relying on drones, special operations forces, and other intelligence capabilities. These methods have made it more difficult for al-Qaida remnants to reconstitute a new safe haven, as Osama bin Laden did in Afghanistan in 1996, after his ouster from Sudan.</p><p>Decapitation works—-studies<br/><strong>Johnston 12</strong> (Patrick B.

There are, however, several reasons why doing so would be in the United States’ best interest.<br/>First, as described in Section II.B, the general framework is largely consistent with current U.S. practice since 2006. The United States has, as a matter of policy, adopted important limits on its use of out-of-battlefield targeting and law-of-war detention suggesting an implicit recognition of the value and benefits of restraint.<br/>Second, while the proposed substantive and procedural safeguards are more stringent than those that <br/>AND<br/>detention without charge and targeted killing can yield legitimacy and security benefits. n218<br/>Third, limiting the exercise of these authorities outside zones of active hostilities better accommodates <br/>AND<br/>development of an international consensus as to the rules that ought to apply.<br/>Fourth, such self-imposed restrictions are more consistent with the United States’ long-standing role as a champion of human rights and the rule of law a role that becomes difficult for the United States to play when viewed as supporting broad-based law-of-war authority that gives it wide latitude to employ force as a first resort and bypass otherwise applicable human rights and domestic law enforcement norms.<br/>Fifth, and critically, while the United States might be confident that it will <br/>AND<br/>American citizen, the United States would have few principled grounds for objecting.</p><p>Congressional restriction key to credibility and signal<br/>Kenneth Anderson, Professor of Law, Washington College of Law, American University, and Research Fellow, The Hoover Institution, Stanford University and Member of its Task Force on National Security and the Law, 5/11/2009, Targeted Killing in U.S. Counterterrorism Strategy and Law, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.brookings.edu/~~/media/research/files/papers/2009/5/1120counterterrorism20anderson/0511_counterterrorism_anderson.pdf  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.brookings.edu/~~/media/research/files/papers/2009/5/1120counterterrorism20anderson/0511_counterterrorism_anderson.pdf%27" tppabs="http://www.brookings.edu/~~/media/research/files/papers/2009/5/1120counterterrorism20anderson/0511_counterterrorism_anderson.pdf"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.brookings.edu/~~/media/research/files/papers/2009/5/1120counterterrorism20anderson/0511_counterterrorism_anderson.pdf</span></a></span></p><p>What Should Congress Do?<br/>Does this analysis offer any practical policy prescriptions for Congress and the administration?

And that’s a troubling trajectory for Democrats feeling the pressure of reelection next year.<br/>Historically, presidents whose approval plummets in their second term don’t recover. Such was the case for Harry Truman back in 1950, according to Gallup surveys. After reaching a high of 46 percent in July of 1950, the 33rd president’s approval never rose above 35 percent during the last two-and-a-half years of his presidency. The precipitous drop coincided with America’s involvement in the Korean War.<br/>Another war helped bring about a more recent president’s downfall. George W. Bush never topped 50 percent after March 2005 and spent most his remaining tenure mired in the low to mid-30s, thanks in part to the unpopularity of the Iraq War. His approval further declined near the end of his presidency, when the financial crisis of 2008 left the economy in tatters.<br/>In fact, no president in the last 60 years has watched his approval ratings <br/>AND<br/>. But it also never fell to lows experienced by Truman or Bush.<br/>"In a second term, once a president’s numbers decline, they never come back up," Ed Goeas, a Republican pollster, told reporters last week during a breakfast hosted by the Christian Science Monitor. "There’s a good reason for that: they don’t have a reelection campaign going on. They don’t have the air cover on air. They’re not putting back together a campaign in contrast to the opposition."<br/>Goeas suggested Obama has reached a similar point-of-no-return in <br/>AND<br/>three-day rolling sample that showed it bottoming out at 39 percent.<br/>Obama and his supporters like to say he’ll never face reelection again, so his numbers don’t matter. But other Democrats — namely red-state Sens. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, Mark Pryor of Arkansas of North, Kay Hagan of North Carolina and Mark Begich of Alaska — will face voters again, during next year’s midterms. And a slumping president has been nothing but bad news for his party colleagues.</p><p>Dem infighting now<br/>Charles <strong>Hurt</strong>, Washington Times, <strong>11/12/</strong>13, HURT: It’s the Democrats, not the GOP, facing a looming civil war, www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/nov/12/hurt-its-the-democrats-not-the-gop-facing-a-loomin/</p><p>Despite what the hysterical media will tell you, those distant blasts you heard last week rolling from New York City to Richmond were not cannon fire from the ongoing civil war within the Republican Party. They were the first shots fired in the civil war that is about to break wide open within the Democratic Party.<br/>The hyperventilating media have gone from simply jaundiced sideline observers to outright cheerleaders, breathlessly fanning the flames of discord within the GOP at every turn. Who knew The New York Times cares so much about Republican politicians from Texas and Utah? Of course, they don’t. Unless those conservative Texans and Utahans are in a knife fight with establishment Republicans in Washington.<br/>Last Tuesday’s Democratic routs in Virginia and in New York City, the media squealed with delight, was final proof that the Republican Party is finished. Not only in sophisticated places like New York City, but also important battleground states like Virginia.<br/>Now it is certainly true that Republicans have suffered some humiliating defeats of late. Chief among them has been their inability in three elections to win the argument against Obamacare. Now that Americans have met Obamacare, we realize just how pathetic Republicans had to have been to lose that fight.<br/>All of that pain caused in recent years by the tea party and the conservative purists throwing overboard so many of the whorish politicians in their own midst who came to Washington only to be corrupted will pay off down the road. The growing new voices in the Republican Party sound more and more reasonable and principled by the day, especially with the hot disaster that has become of centralized socialist medicine.<br/>Some of those battles are still yet to come, but at least the party is on the road to recovery.<br/>Not so the Democrats. Flush with victories of their opponents’ making in recent years, they have gotten a little fat and lazy, and now they’re overreaching.<br/>Terry McAuliffe was cruising to a double-digit win in Virginia — only to have Obamacare raise its ugly head and nearly snatch victory away at the last minute.<br/>In New York City, voters elected an unreconstructed old-school liberal from the days of Austin Powers. New Yorkers are not nearly the doctrinaire liberals that many people tend to believe. They like politicians who make their sprawling, unruly city work. Just as soon as the crime, trash piles and taxes start rising, they will be ready to throw Bill DiBlasio out.<br/>Democrats in the Senate realize the trouble they are in, which is why they marched down to the White House last week to blast President Obama over the political stink bomb of a health care law that he has dumped into their laps just in time for their 2014 re-election campaigns.<br/>Best of all, the Clintons realize this, too. Tuesday’s explosive interview where former President Clinton called on Mr. Obama to "honor" his "commitment" and allow people to keep their health insurance plans if they like them was not only another blast in the Democratic civil war, it was the opening salvo by the Clinton campaign to throw Mr. Obama under the bus.</p></div></div></td><td>11/16/13</td></tr><tr><td style="width:100%; word-break:break-all; word-break:break-word;"><div><p><input onclick="saveEntry(6)" src="../../xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" tppabs="http://opencaselist13.paperlessdebate.com/xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" style="float:right;" title="Save" type="image" value="Save"></input>

Assessing the Effectiveness of Leadership Targeting in Counterinsurgency Campaigns," published in International Security (Spring 2012)., 8/22/2012, "Drone Strikes Keep Pressure on al-Qaida", www.rand.org/blog/2012/08/drone-strikes-keep-pressure-on-al-qaida.html)</p><p>Should the U.S. continue to strike at al-Qaida’s leadership with drone attacks? A recent poll shows that while most Americans approve of drone strikes, in 17 out of 20 countries, more than half of those surveyed disapprove of them.<br/>My study of leadership decapitation in 90 counter-insurgencies since the 1970s shows that when militant leaders are captured or killed militant attacks decrease, terrorist campaigns end sooner, and their outcomes tend to favor the government or third-party country, not the militants.<br/>Those opposed to drone strikes often cite the June 2009 one that targeted Pakistani Taliban <br/>AND<br/>cited drone strikes as a key motivation for his May 2010 attempted attack.<br/>Compared to manned aircraft, drones have some advantages as counter-insurgency tools, such as lower costs, longer endurance and the lack of a pilot to place in harm’s way and risk of capture. These characteristics can enable a more deliberative targeting process that serves to minimize unintentional casualties. But the weapons employed by drones are usually identical to those used via manned aircraft and can still kill civilians—creating enmity that breeds more terrorists.<br/>Yet many insurgents and terrorists have been taken off the battlefield by U.S. drones and special-operations forces. Besides Mehsud, the list includes Anwar al-Awlaki of al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula; al-Qaida deputy leader Abu Yahya al-Li-bi; and, of course, al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden. Given that list, it is possible that the drone program has prevented numerous attacks by their potential followers, like Shazad.<br/>What does the removal of al-Qaida leadership mean for U.S. national security? Though many in al-Qaida’s senior leadership cadre remain, the historical record suggests that "decapitation" will likely weaken the organization and could cripple its ability to conduct major attacks on the U.S. homeland.<br/>Killing terrorist leaders is not necessarily a knockout blow, but can make it harder for terrorists to attack the U.S. Members of al-Qaida’s central leadership, once safely amassed in northwestern Pakistan while America shifted its focus to Iraq, have been killed, captured, forced underground or scattered to various locations with little ability to communicate or move securely.<br/>Recently declassified correspondence seized in the bin Laden raid shows that the relentless pressure from the drone campaign on al-Qaida in Pakistan led bin Laden to advise al-Qaida operatives to leave Pakistan’s Tribal Areas as no longer safe. Bin Laden’s letters show that U.S. counterterrorism actions, which had forced him into self-imposed exile, had made running the organization not only more risky, but also more difficult.<br/>As al-Qaida members trickle out of Pakistan and seek sanctuary elsewhere, the U.S. military is ramping up its counterterrorism operations in Somalia and Yemen, while continuing its drone campaign in Pakistan. Despite its controversial nature, the U.S. counter-terrorism strategy has demonstrated a degree of effectiveness.<br/>The Obama administration is committed to reducing the size of the U.S. military’s footprint overseas by relying on drones, special operations forces, and other intelligence capabilities. These methods have made it more difficult for al-Qaida remnants to reconstitute a new safe haven, as Osama bin Laden did in Afghanistan in 1996, after his ouster from Sudan.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HDronesareoperationallyeffectiveandalternativesareworse2014establishingaclearstrikepolicysolvescriticism.-2" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Drones are operationally effective and alternatives are worse—establishing a clear strike policy solves criticism.</span></h4><p>Byman 13 (Daniel Byman, Brookings Institute Saban Center for Middle East Policy, Research Director, and Foreign Policy, Senior Fellow, July/Aug 2013, "Why Drones Work: The Case for the Washington’s Weapon of Choice", www.brookings.edu/research/articles/2013/06/17-drones-obama-weapon-choice-us-counterterrorism-byman)</p><p>Despite President Barack Obama’s recent call to reduce the United States’ reliance on drones, <br/>AND<br/>indiscriminately bomb civilian areas or use scorched-earth tactics against militant groups. <br/> <br/>Risk of nuclear terrorism is real and high now <br/>Bunn 13 (Matthew, Valentin Kuznetsov, Martin B.

CONTROLLING THE RECOURSE TO WAR BY MODIFYING JUS IN BELLO, Yearbook of International Humanitarian Law / Volume 12</p><p>A substantial literature exists on the conflation of jus ad bellum and jus in bello. However, the consequences for the former side of the equation – the resort to war – is generally under-examined. Instead, academic commentary has focused on the effects of compliance with humanitarian rules in armed conflict and, in particular, the equality of application principle. In this section, I attempt to help correct that imbalance.<br/>In the following analysis, I use the (admittedly provocative) short-hand labels of ’desirable’ and ’undesirable’ wars. The former consists of efforts that aim to promote the general welfare of foreign populations such as humanitarian interventions and, on some accounts, peacekeeping operations. The latter – undesirable wars – include conflicts that result from security spirals that serve neither state’s interest and also include predatory acts of aggression.<br/>4.1.1 Decreased likelihood of ’desirable wars’<br/>A central question in debates about humanitarian intervention is whether the international community should be <br/>AND<br/>short, all ’interventions to protect civilians from wholesale slaughter’ are affected.<br/>Two developments render desirable interventions less likely. First, consider implications of the Kosovo <br/>AND<br/>one would most want to incentivize to initiate and participate in humanitarian interventions.<br/>The second development shares many of these same consequences.

George Miller of California, Louise Slaughter of New York and Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut said of the measure, introduced last week: "Our constituents did not send us to Washington to ship their jobs overseas, and Congress will not be a rubber stamp for another flawed trade deal that will hang the middle class out to dry."<br/>Their comments echoed those of dozens of Democrats who greeted the bill with a raft of complaints, saying that advancing huge trade deals is out of step with their party’s more populist election-year message of economic inequality.<br/>The free-trade push joins a growing list of policies Obama has championed that are unpopular with Democrats, not the least of which have been agreeing to steep fiscal cuts, using drones abroad, failing to rein in eavesdropping on Americans by the National Security Agency and abandoning the public option in the landmark 2010 heath care overhaul, for which the president has bled support.<br/>The problem isn’t just Obama’s trade policy but also its execution, congressional sources said.</p><p>Plan doesn’t cost capital<br/>Douglas <strong>Kriner</strong>, Assistant Profess of Political Science at Boston University, 20<strong>10</strong>, After the Rubicon: Congress, Presidents, and the Politics of Waging War, p. 59-60</p><p>Presidents and politicos alike have long recognized Congress’s ability to reduce the political costs that <br/>AND<br/>.S. interests or the constitutionality of the War Powers Resolution."36</p><p>If Obama is focusing capital on <ins>_¬¬¬¬</ins>_, it disproves Obama would initiate a fight over the plan&nbsp;</p><p>He’ll avoid the fight<br/>William <strong>Howell and&nbsp;</strong>Jon <strong>Pevehouse</strong>, Associate Professors at the Harris School of Public Policy at the University of Chicago, 200<strong>7</strong>, When Congress Stops Wars, Foreign Affairs, EBSCO</p><p>After all, when presidents anticipate congressional resistance they will not be able to overcome<br/>AND<br/>Pace, so as to avoid a clash with Congress over his reappointment.</p><p>Obamacare outweighs AND solves the link – it determines PC and the survival of every agenda item<br/>Sean <strong>Sullivan 12-23</strong>, Washington Post, Joe Manchin’s Obamacare fears — and why they matter, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2013/12/23/joe-manchins-obamacare-fears-and-why-they-matter/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2013/12/23/joe-manchins-obamacare-fears-and-why-they-matter/%27" tppabs="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2013/12/23/joe-manchins-obamacare-fears-and-why-they-matter/"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2013/12/23/joe-manchins-obamacare-fears-and-why-they-matter/</span></a></span></p><p>That of course, is a sort of worst-case-scenario view. But preparing for the worst possible scenario is what red and swing state Democrats like Manchin will be doing throughout the course of the next year. If problems with the health-care law continue, you will start to hear Democrats from states in which Obama is unpopular distance themselves even more from him.<br/>If the law’s image improves, you will hear less of that. And that will mean more political capital for Obama to address issues like the economy — or maybe even immigration.<br/>Then, Republicans eager to shepherd immigration reform may grow increasingly open to working with the president on a modest bill that meets his requirements. And there may be more common fiscal ground to be found for congressional Republicans and the White House — some of which was paved in the bipartisan budget plan that passed this year.<br/>But for now at least, the health-care law looks to remain the dominant issue. And how it proceeds headed into the new year will determine a lot, even on issues that have nothing to do with health care.</p><p>Obama won’t exert capital<br/>Maureen <strong>Dowd</strong>, NYTimes, 4/20/<strong>13</strong>, No Bully in the Pulpit, www.nytimes.com/2013/04/21/opinion/sunday/dowd-president-obama-is-no-bully-in-the-pulpit.html?partner=rssnyt26emc=rss26_r=126</p><p>Unfortunately, he still has not learned how to govern.<br/>How is it that the president won the argument on gun safety with the public and lost the vote in the Senate? It’s because he doesn’t know how to work the system. And it’s clear now that he doesn’t want to learn, or to even hire some clever people who can tell him how to do it or do it for him.<br/>It’s unbelievable that with 90 percent of Americans on his side, he could get only 54 votes in the Senate. It was a glaring example of his weakness in using leverage to get what he wants. No one on Capitol Hill is scared of him.<br/>Even House Republicans who had no intention of voting for the gun bill marveled privately that the president could not muster 60 votes in a Senate that his party controls.<br/>President Obama thinks he can use emotion to bring pressure on Congress. But that’s not how adults with power respond to things. He chooses not to get down in the weeds and pretend he values the stroking and other little things that matter to lawmakers.<br/>After the Newtown massacre, he and his aides hashed it out and decided he would look cold and unsympathetic if he didn’t push for some new regulations. To thunderous applause at the State of the Union, the president said, "The families of Newtown deserve a vote." Then, as usual, he took his foot off the gas, lost momentum and confided his pessimism to journalists.<br/>The White House had a defeatist mantra: This is tough. We need to do it. But we’re probably going to lose.<br/>When you go into a fight saying you’re probably going to lose, you’re probably going to lose.<br/>The president once more delegated to the vice president. Couldn’t he have come to the Hill himself to lobby with the families and Joe Biden?<br/>The White House should have created a war room full of charts with the names of pols they had to capture, like they had in "The American President."

It has since gone through multiple iterations.<br/>The initial concept followed on the federal full-scale Top Official ("TopOff") exercises, used to train government officials to respond to domestic crises.165 It adapted a Tabletop Exercise, designed with the help of exercise officials at DHS and FEMA, to the law school environment. The Tabletop used one storyline to push on specific legal questions, as students, assigned roles in the discussion, sat around a table and for six hours engaged with the material.<br/>The problem with the Tabletop Exercise was that it was too static, and the <br/>AND<br/>focused on specific legal issues, even as it controlled for external chaos.<br/>The opportunity to provide a more full experience for the students came with the creation of first a one-day, and then a multi-day simulation. The course design and simulation continues to evolve. It offers a model for achieving the pedagogical goals outlined above, in the process developing a rigorous training ground for the next generation of national security lawyers.166<br/>A. Course Design<br/>The central idea in structuring the NSL Sim 2.0 course was to bridge <br/>AND<br/>and legal education) and flexible (responsive to student input and decisionmaking).<br/>Perhaps the most significant weakness in the use of any constructed universe is the problem <br/>AND<br/>student decisions themselves must drive the evolution of events within the simulation.168<br/>Additionally, while authenticity matters, it is worth noting that at some level the <br/>AND<br/>that would be much more difficult to do in a regular practice setting.<br/>NSL Sim 2.0 takes as its starting point the national security pedagogical goals discussed above. It works backwards to then engineer a classroom, cyber, and physical/simulation experience to delve into each of these areas. As a substantive matter, the course focuses on the constitutional, statutory, and regulatory authorities in national security law, placing particular focus on the interstices between black letter law and areas where the field is either unsettled or in flux.<br/>A key aspect of the course design is that it retains both the doctrinal and <br/>AND<br/>giving students the opportunity to develop depth and breadth prior to the exercise.<br/>In order to capture problems related to adaptation and evolution, addressing goal ~1<br/>AND<br/>Law to build the cyber portal used for NSL Sim 2.0.<br/>The twin goals of adaptation and evolution require that students be given a significant amount <br/>AND<br/>execution of the play, further developing their understanding of national security law.<br/>Throughout the simulation, the Control Team is constantly reacting to student choices. When unexpected decisions are made, professors may choose to pursue the evolution of the story to accomplish the pedagogical aims, or they may choose to cut off play in that area (there are various devices for doing so, such as denying requests, sending materials to labs to be analyzed, drawing the players back into the main storylines, and leaking information to the media).<br/>A total immersion simulation involves a number of scenarios, as well as systemic noise<br/>AND<br/>but to embrace them as part of the challenge facing national security lawyers.<br/>The simulation itself is problem-based, giving players agency in driving the evolution <br/>AND<br/>, generating in turn a set of new issues that must be addressed.<br/>The written and oral components of the simulation conform to the fourth pedagogical goal – <br/>AND<br/>simulation – and to deliver a 90 second oral briefing after the session.<br/>To replicate the high-stakes political environment at issue in goals (1) <br/>AND<br/>many different considerations that decisionmakers take into account in the national security domain.<br/>Scenarios are selected with high consequence events in mind, to ensure that students recognize <br/>AND<br/>to emphasize the broader political context within which national security law is practiced.<br/>Both anticipated and unanticipated decisions give rise to ethical questions and matters related to the <br/>AND<br/>exercise itself hitting the aim of the integration of the various pedagogical goals.<br/>Finally, there are multiple layers of feedback that players receive prior to, during<br/>AND<br/>, while another Control Team member may reject a FISC application as insufficient.<br/>The simulation goes beyond this, however, focusing on teaching students how to develop <br/>AND<br/>uncertainty, tension with colleagues, mistakes, and successes in the future.<br/>B. Substantive Areas: Interstices and Threats<br/>As a substantive matter, NSL Sim 2.0 is designed to take account <br/>AND<br/>weapons and pandemic disease also come within the doctrinal part of the course.<br/>The simulation itself is based on five to six storylines reflecting the interstices between different areas of the law. The storylines are used to present a coherent, non-linear scenario that can adapt to student responses. Each scenario is mapped out in a three to seven page document, which is then checked with scientists, government officials, and area experts for consistency with how the scenario would likely unfold in real life.<br/>For the biological weapons and pandemic disease emphasis, for example, one narrative might <br/>AND<br/>through press releases, weather updates, private communications, and the like.<br/>The five to six storylines, prepared by the Control Team in consultation with experts<br/>AND<br/>, giving the Control Team a birds-eye view of the progression.<br/>C. How It Works<br/>As for the nuts and bolts of the simulation itself, it traditionally begins outside of class, in the evening, on the grounds that national security crises often occur at inconvenient times and may well involve limited sleep and competing demands.171 Typically, a phone call from a Control Team member posing in a role integral to one of the main storylines, initiates play.<br/>Students at this point have been assigned dedicated simulation email addresses and provided access to <br/>AND<br/>relevant student teams. The Control Team has access to the complete site.<br/>For the next two (or three) days, outside of student initiatives (<br/>AND<br/>, or technology concerns, while setting the stage for the breaking crisis.<br/>The third (or fourth) day of play takes place entirely at Georgetown Law<br/>AND<br/>releases. Students use their own laptop computers for team decisions and communication.<br/>As the storylines unfold, the Control Team takes on a variety of roles, <br/>AND<br/>the simulation unfolded, and how the students performed in their various capacities.<br/>At the end of the day, the exercise terminates and an immediate hotwash is held, in which players are first debriefed on what occurred during the simulation. Because of the players’ divergent experiences and the different roles assigned to them, the students at this point are often unaware of the complete picture. The judges and formal observers then offer reflections on the simulation and determine which teams performed most effectively.<br/>Over the next few classes, more details about the simulation emerge, as students <br/>AND<br/>opportunities for learning in the future. The course then formally ends.172 <br/>Learning, however, continues beyond the temporal confines of the semester. Students who <br/>AND<br/>concerns. And it builds a strong community of individuals with common interests.<br/>CONCLUSION<br/>The legal academy has, of late, been swept up in concern about the <br/>AND<br/>both the expression of government authority and the effort to limit the same.<br/>The one-size fits all approach currently dominating the conversation in legal education, <br/>AND<br/>greater nuance in the discussion of the adequacy of the current pedagogical approach.<br/>With this approach in mind, I have here suggested six pedagogical goals for national <br/>AND<br/>to ensure that they will be most effective when they enter the field.<br/>The problem with the current structures in legal education is that they fall short, <br/>AND<br/>in other areas of experiential education, such as clinics and moot court.<br/>It is in an effort to address these concerns that I developed the simulation model <br/>AND<br/>undoubtedly necessary, it suggests one potential direction for the years to come.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>The alt’s pacificism lets injustice go unstopped – we can acknowledge that all violence is tragic while still recognizing that it’s necessary in some instances<br/>Debra Bergoffen, Professor of Philosophy and a member of the Women’s Studies and Cultural Studies programs at George Mason University, Spring 2008, The Just War Tradition: Translating the Ethics of Human Dignity into Political Practices, Hypatia Volume 23, Number 2<br/> <br/>The just war tradition is riddled with ambiguities.

This play-it-safe strategy hinges on voters turning out in droves to voice their displeasure with President Obama’s health care law and his administration’s domestic-surveillance policies, among other things.<br/>But such an approach is unacceptable to the most conservative members of the House GOP. After two weeks of private deliberations, and fresh off a mini-retreat this week organized by the Republican Study Committee, conservatives are united in their resolve to make 2014 more about Republicans’ "bold, positive vision" and less about Obama’s failures.<br/>"I’m convinced Republicans have the best vision for America’s future," Rep. Kevin Brady of Texas said outside of Wednesday’s RSC meeting. "We’ve spent a lot of time opposing the president’s policies, but it’s time to share our vision if we want to win in November."<br/>That sentiment has echoed among conservative lawmakers all week, and it ramped up during <br/>AND<br/>reform plan, a welfare-reform package, and a privacy bill.<br/>"I don’t want to play prevent defense," Scalise said, according to members in attendance. "I want to play offense."<br/>Asked to explain the remark later in an interview, Scalise said, "Usually teams that play prevent defense lose the game."<br/>But Boehner’s team doesn’t share that view. GOP leadership has done everything possible in recent months to keep the electorate’s attention on the Democrats, especially highlighting the disastrous rollout of President Obama’s health care law and Republican oversight efforts on the IRS scandal and Benghazi attacks.

Not toys or models, but real flying machines.<br/>It’s a classic and common phase in the life cycle of a military innovation: <br/>AND<br/>the United States; it’s a precedent Washington does not want anyone following.<br/>America, the world’s leading democracy and a country built on a legal and moral framework unlike any other, has adopted a war-making process that too often bypasses its traditional, regimented, and rigorously overseen military in favor of a secret program never publicly discussed, based on legal advice never properly vetted. The Obama administration has used its executive power to refuse or outright ignore requests by congressional overseers, and it has resisted monitoring by federal courts.<br/>To implement this covert program, the administration has adopted a tool that lowers the <br/>AND<br/>-states involved but also destabilize entire regions and potentially upset geopolitical order.<br/>Hyperbole? Consider this: Iran, with the approval of Damascus, carries out <br/>AND<br/>learned it by watching you. In Pakistan, Yemen, and Afghanistan.<br/>This is the unintended consequence of American drone warfare. For all of the attention <br/>AND<br/>uses of one of the most awesome military robotics capabilities of this generation.<br/>THE WRONG QUESTION <br/>The United States is the indisputable leader in drone technology and long-range strike<br/>AND<br/>billions of dollars that have gone into establishing and maintaining such a capability.<br/>That level of superiority leads some national security officials to downplay concerns about other nations’ <br/>AND<br/>the unparalleled intelligence-collection and data-analysis underpinning the aircraft’s mission.<br/>"There is what I think is just an unconstrained focus on a tool as <br/>AND<br/>who are interpreting the information that’s coming off the sensors on the aircraft."<br/>The analysts are part of the global architecture that makes precision strikes, and targeted <br/>AND<br/>) outweigh the reward (judged by the value of the threat eliminated).<br/>"Is that a shovel or a rifle? Is that a Taliban member or <br/>AND<br/>. We can orbit long enough to be pretty sure about our target."<br/>Other countries, groups, and even individuals can and do fly drones. But no state or group has nearly the sophisticated network of intelligence and data analysis that gives the United States its strategic advantage. Although it would be foolish to dismiss the notion that potential U.S. adversaries aspire to attain that type of war-from-afar, pinpoint-strike capability, they have neither the income nor the perceived need to do so.<br/>That’s true, at least today. It’s also irrelevant. Others who employ drones are likely to carry a different agenda, one more concerned with employing a relatively inexpensive and ruthlessly efficient tool to dispatch an enemy close at hand.<br/>"It would be very difficult for them to create the global-strike architecture <br/>AND<br/>long-duration surveillance and potentially strike inside and right on its border."<br/>And that’s a NATO ally seeking the capability to conduct missions that would run afoul <br/>AND<br/>uses the aircraft to strike Lashkar-e-Taiba militants near Kashmir?<br/>"We don’t like other states using lethal force outside their borders. It’s destabilizing. It can lead to a sort of wider escalation of violence between two states," said Micah Zenko, a security policy and drone expert at the Council on Foreign Relations. "So the proliferation of drones is not just about the protection of the United States. It’s primarily about the likelihood that other states will increasingly use lethal force outside of their borders."<br/>LOWERING THE BAR<br/>Governments have covertly killed for ages, whether they maintained an official hit list or <br/>AND<br/>American security experts point to Russia as well, although Moscow disputes this.<br/>In the 1960s, the U.S. government was involved to differing levels <br/>AND<br/>late as 2001, Washington’s stated policy was to oppose Israel’s targeted killings.)<br/>When America adopted targeted killing again—first under the Bush administration after the September 11 attacks and then expanded by President Obama—the tools of the trade had changed. No longer was the CIA sending poison, pistols, and toxic cigars to assets overseas to kill enemy leaders. Now it could target people throughout al-Qaida’s hierarchy with accuracy, deliver lethal ordnance literally around the world, and watch the mission’s completion in real time.<br/>The United States is smartly using technology to improve combat efficacy, and to make <br/>AND<br/>, defense hawks and spendthrifts alike would criticize it if it did not.<br/>"If you believe that these folks are legitimate terrorists who are committing acts of <br/>AND<br/>Do we have the debate if an aircraft pilot drops a particular bomb?"<br/>But defense analysts argue—and military officials concede—there is a qualitative difference <br/>AND<br/>States would not have pursued an equivalent number of manned strikes in Pakistan.<br/>And what’s true for the United States will be true as well for other countries that own and arm remote piloted aircraft.<br/>"The drones—the responsiveness, the persistence, and without putting your personnel at risk—is what makes it a different technology," Zenko said. "When other states have this technology, if they follow U.S. practice, it will lower the threshold for their uses of lethal force outside their borders. So they will be more likely to conduct targeted killings than they have in the past."<br/>The Obama administration appears to be aware of and concerned about setting precedents through its targeted-strike program. When the development of a disposition matrix to catalog both targets and resources marshaled against the United States was first reported in 2012, officials spoke about it in part as an effort to create a standardized process that would live beyond the current administration, underscoring the long duration of the counterterrorism challenge.<br/>Indeed, the president’s legal and security advisers have put considerable effort into establishing rules <br/>AND<br/>lead somebody to be subject for an engagement by the United States government."<br/>BEHIND CLOSED DOORS<br/>The argument against public debate is easy enough to understand: Operational secrecy is necessary<br/>AND<br/>public debate, which is going to be a hard one to win."<br/>But by keeping legal and policy positions secret, only partially sharing information even with congressional oversight committees, and declining to open a public discussion about drone use, the president and his team are asking the world to just trust that America is getting this right. While some will, many people, especially outside the United States, will see that approach as hypocritical, coming from a government that calls for transparency and the rule of law elsewhere.<br/>"I know these people, and I know how much they really, really <br/>AND<br/>would be giving you a different rendering, and much more uncertain rendering."<br/>That’s only part of the problem with the White House’s trust-us approach. <br/>AND<br/>) an imminent threat of violent attack 5) against the United States.<br/>But that’s not who is being targeted.<br/>Setting aside the administration’s redefining of "imminence" beyond all recognition, the majority <br/>AND<br/>States (another precedent that might be eagerly seized upon in the future).<br/>U.S. defense and intelligence officials reject any suggestion that the targets are <br/>AND<br/>new Secretary of State John Kerry criticized during his confirmation hearing this year.<br/>Human-rights groups might be loudest in their criticism of both the program and <br/>AND<br/>by principles and rules of the Constitution and of the Bill of Rights."<br/>PEER PRESSURE<br/>Obama promised in his 2013 State of the Union to increase the drone program’s transparency<br/>AND<br/>of the legal memos the Justice Department drafted in support of targeted killing.<br/>But, beyond that, it’s not certain Obama will do anything more to shine light on this program. Except in situations where leaks help it tell a politically expedient story of its skill at killing bad guys, the administration has done little to make a case to the public and the world at large for its use of armed drones.<br/>Already, what’s become apparent is that the White House is not interested in changing <br/>AND<br/>largely off the table now, according to intelligence officials and committee members.<br/>Under discussion within the administration and on Capitol Hill is a potential program takeover by <br/>AND<br/>provide no guarantee of greater transparency for the public, or even Congress.<br/>And if the administration is not willing to share with lawmakers who are security-cleared to know, it certainly is not prepared to engage in a sensitive discussion, even among allies, that might begin to set the rules on use for a technology that could upend stability in already fragile and strategically significant places around the globe. Time is running out to do so.<br/>"The history of technology development like this is, you never maintain your lead very long. Somebody always gets it," said David Berteau, director of the International Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "They’re going to become cheaper. They’re going to become easier. They’re going to become interoperable," he said. "The destabilizing effects are very, very serious."<br/>Berteau is not alone. Zenko, of the Council on Foreign Relations, has <br/>AND<br/>angles on this question are why you see them in conflict right now."<br/>That’s in part a symptom of the "technological optimism" that often plagues the U.S. security community when it establishes a lead over its competitors, noted Georgetown University’s Kai-Henrik Barth. After the 1945 bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the United States was sure it would be decades before the Soviets developed a nuclear-weapon capability. It took four years.<br/>With drones, the question is how long before the dozens of states with the <br/>AND<br/>nations have gone down the pathway of first only surveillance and then arming."<br/>The opportunity to write rules that might at least guide, if not restrain, <br/>AND<br/>—to be closer to certain that their target is the right one.<br/>But even without raising standards, tightening up drone-specific restrictions in the standing <br/>AND<br/>, or 15 years—might find helpful in arguing against another’s actions.<br/>A not-insignificant faction of U.S. defense and intelligence experts, <br/>AND<br/>some weapons, including land mines, blinding lasers, and nuclear bombs.<br/>Arguably more significant than spotty legal regimes, however, is the behavior of the <br/>AND<br/>policy that it did most recently on "enhanced interrogation" of terrorists.<br/>The case against open, transparent rule-making is that it might only hamstring <br/>AND<br/>operations manual for other nations but a legal and moral one as well.</p><p>Geographic restrictions are key<br/>Rosa Brooks, Professor of Law, Georgetown University Law Center, Bernard L.

The Rule of Law <br/>At root, the idea of "rule of law" is fairly simple, <br/>AND<br/>processes and rules that reflect basic notions of justice, humanity and fairness.<br/>Precisely what constitutes a fair process is debatable, but most would agree that at <br/>AND<br/>Civil and Political Rights, to which the United States is a party.<br/>In ordinary circumstances, this bundle of universally acknowledged rights (together with international law <br/>AND<br/>States government called this an act of murder—an unlawful political assassination.<br/>B. Targeted Killing and the Law of Armed Conflict<br/>Of course, sometimes the "ordinary" legal rules do not apply. In <br/>AND<br/>the principles of necessity, humanity, proportionality,29 and distinction.30<br/>It is worth briefly explaining these principles. The principle of necessity requires parties to <br/>AND<br/>in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage expected to be gained.<br/>Finally, the principle of discrimination or distinction requires that parties to a conflict direct their actions only against combatants and military objectives, and take appropriate steps to distinguish between combatants and non-combatants.31<br/>This is a radical oversimplification of a very complex body of law.32 But <br/>AND<br/>by military necessity34 — but there are far fewer constraints on state behavior.<br/>Technically, the law of war is referred to using the Latin term "lex specialis" – special law. It is applicable in—and only in — special circumstances (in this case, armed conflict), and in those special circumstances, it supersedes "ordinary law," or "lex generalis," the "general law" that prevails in peacetime. We have one set of laws for "normal" situations, and another, more flexible set of laws for "extraordinary" situations, such as armed conflicts.<br/>None of this poses any inherent problem for the rule of law. Having one body of rules that tightly restricts the use of force and another body of rules that is far more permissive does not fundamentally undermine the rule of law, as long as we have a reasonable degree of consensus on what circumstances trigger the "special" law, and as long as the "special law" doesn’t end up undermining the general law.<br/>To put it a little differently, war, with its very different rules, <br/>AND<br/>, and between places where there’s war and places where there’s no war.<br/>Let me return now to the question of drones and targeted killings. When all <br/>AND<br/>Libyan military targets is no more controversial than the use of manned aircraft.<br/>That is because our core rule of law concerns have mostly been satisfied: we <br/>AND<br/>in the event of error or abuse (the various governments involved).35<br/>Once you take targeted killings outside hot battlefields, it’s a different story. The <br/>AND<br/>any time — with regard to any person the administration deems a combatant.<br/>The trouble is, no one outside a very small group within the US executive <br/>AND<br/>of the time, the US will not even officially acknowledge targeted killings.<br/>This leaves all the key rule-of-law questions related to the ongoing <br/>AND<br/>determinations, and what is the precise chain of command for such decisions?<br/>I think the rule of law problem here is obvious: when "armed conflict<br/>AND<br/>are they, as some human rights groups have argued, unlawful murder?<br/>C. Targeted Killing and the International Law of Self-Defense <br/>When faced with criticisms of the law of war framework as a justification for targeted <br/>AND<br/>that the defensive force used is otherwise consistent with law of war principles.<br/>Like law of war-based arguments, this general principle is superficially uncontroversial: if someone overseas is about to launch a nuclear weapon at New York City, no one can doubt that the United States has a perfect right (and the president has a constitutional duty) to use force if needed to prevent that attack, regardless of the attacker’s nationality.<br/>But once again, the devil is in the details. To start with, what constitutes an "imminent" threat? Traditionally, both international law and domestic criminal law understand that term narrowly: 37 to be "imminent," a threat cannot be distant or speculative.38 But much like the Bush Administration before it, the Obama Administration has put forward an interpretation of the word "imminent" that bears little relation to traditional legal concepts.<br/>According to a leaked 2011 Justice Department white paper39—the most detailed legal justification that has yet become public— the requirement of imminence "does not require the United States to have clear evidence that a specific attack on U.S. persons and interests will take place in the immediate future." This seems, in itself, like a substantial departure from accepted international law definitions of imminence.<br/>But the White Paper goes even further, stating that "certain members of al <br/>AND<br/>identity or status (a familiar part of the law of armed conflict).<br/>That concept of imminence has been called Orwellian, and although that is an overused epithet, in this context it seems fairly appropriate. According to the Obama Administration, "imminent" no longer means "immediate," and in fact the very absence of clear evidence indicating specific present or future attack plans becomes, paradoxically, the basis for assuming that attack may perpetually be "imminent."<br/>The 2011 Justice Department White Paper notes that the use of force in self-defense must comply with general law of war principles of necessity, proportionality, humanity, and distinction. The White Paper offers no guidance on the specific criteria for determining when an individual is a combatant (or a civilian participating directly in hostilities), however. It also offers no guidance on how to determine if a use of force is necessary or proportionate.<br/>From a traditional international law perspective, this necessity and proportionality inquiry relates both to <br/>AND<br/>American citizen abroad — or against non-citizens, for that matter?<br/>As I have noted, it is impossible for outsiders to fully evaluate US drone strikes, since so much vital information remains classified. In most cases, we know little about the identities; activities or future plans of those targeted. Nevertheless, given the increased frequency of US targeted killings in recent years, it seems reasonable to wonder whether the Administration conducts a rigorous necessity or proportionality analysis in all cases.<br/>So far, the leaked 2011 Justice Department White Paper represents the most detailed legal <br/>AND<br/>citizens are less exacting than those the Administration views as applicable to citizens.<br/>Defenders of administration targeted killing policy acknowledge that the criteria for determining how to answer these many questions have not been made public, but insist that this should not be cause for concern. The Administration has reportedly developed a detailed "playbook" outlining the targeting criteria and procedures,40, and insiders insist that executive branch officials go through an elaborate process in which they carefully consider every possible issue before determining that a drone strike is lawful.41<br/>No doubt they do, but this is somewhat cold comfort. Formal processes tend to further normalize once-exceptional activities — and "trust us" is a rather shaky foundation for the rule of law. Indeed, the whole point of the rule of law is that individual lives and freedom should not depend solely on the good faith and benevolence of government officials.<br/>As with law of war arguments, stating that US targeted killings are clearly legal under traditional self-defense principles requires some significant cognitive dissonance. Law exists to restrain untrammeled power. It is no doubt possible to make a plausible legal argument justifying each and every U.S. drone strike — but this merely suggests that we are working with a legal framework that has begun to outlive its usefulness.<br/>The real question isn’t whether U.S. drone strikes are "legal."

It also could elevate the threat to neighbors with territorial disputes with Beijing, including Vietnam, Japan, India and the Philippines. China says its drones are capable of carrying bombs and missiles as well as conducting reconnaissance, potentially turning them into offensive weapons in a border conflict.<br/>China’s increased use of drones also adds to concerns about the lack of internationally recognized standards for drone attacks. The United States has widely employed drones as a means of eliminating terror suspects in Pakistan and the Arabian Peninsula.<br/>"China is following the precedent set by the U.S. The thinking is that, `If the U.S. can do it, so can we. They’re a big country with security interests and so are we’," said Siemon Wezeman, a senior fellow at the arms transfers program at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute in Sweden, or SIPRI.<br/>"The justification for an attack would be that Beijing too has a responsibility for the safety of its citizens. There needs to be agreement on what the limits are," he said.<br/>Though China claims its military posture is entirely defensive, its navy and civilian maritime services have engaged in repeated standoffs with ships from other nations in the South China and East China seas. India, meanwhile, says Chinese troops have set up camp almost 20 kilometers (12 miles) into Indian-claimed territory.<br/>It isn’t yet known exactly what China’s latest drones are capable of, because, like most Chinese equipment, they remain untested in battle.<br/>The military and associated aerospace firms have offered little information, although in an interview last month with the official Xinhua News Agency, Yang Baikui, chief designer at plane maker COSIC, said Chinese drones were closing the gap but still needed to progress in half a dozen major areas, from airframe design to digital linkups.<br/>Executives at COSIC and drone makers ASN, Avic, and the 611 Institute declined to be interviewed by The Associated Press, citing their military links. The Defense Ministry’s latest report on the status of the military released in mid-April made no mention of drones, and spokesman Yang Yujun made only the barest acknowledgement of their existence in response to a question.<br/>"Drones are a new high-tech form of weaponry employed and used by many militaries around the world," Yang said. "China’s armed forces are developing weaponry and equipment for the purpose of upholding territorial integrity, national security and world peace. It will pose no threat to any country."<br/>Drones are already patrolling China’s borders, and a navy drone was deployed to the western province of Sichuan to provide aerial surveillance following last month’s deadly earthquake there.<br/>They may also soon be appearing over China’s maritime claims, including Japanese-controlled East China Sea islands that China considers its own. That could sharpen tensions in an area where Chinese and Japanese patrol boats already confront each other on a regular basis and Japan frequently scrambles fighters to tail Chinese manned aircraft.</p><p>SCS conflict causes extinction<br/><strong>Wittner 11</strong> (Lawrence S.

Johnston is an associate political scientist at the RAND Corporation, a nonprofit, nonpartisan research institution. He is the author of "Does Decapitation Work? Assessing the Effectiveness of Leadership Targeting in Counterinsurgency Campaigns," published in International Security (Spring 2012)., 8/22/2012, "Drone Strikes Keep Pressure on al-Qaida", www.rand.org/blog/2012/08/drone-strikes-keep-pressure-on-al-qaida.html)</p><p>Should the U.S. continue to strike at al-Qaida’s leadership with drone attacks? A recent poll shows that while most Americans approve of drone strikes, in 17 out of 20 countries, more than half of those surveyed disapprove of them.<br/>My study of leadership decapitation in 90 counter-insurgencies since the 1970s shows that when militant leaders are captured or killed militant attacks decrease, terrorist campaigns end sooner, and their outcomes tend to favor the government or third-party country, not the militants.<br/>Those opposed to drone strikes often cite the June 2009 one that targeted Pakistani Taliban <br/>AND<br/>cited drone strikes as a key motivation for his May 2010 attempted attack.<br/>Compared to manned aircraft, drones have some advantages as counter-insurgency tools, such as lower costs, longer endurance and the lack of a pilot to place in harm’s way and risk of capture. These characteristics can enable a more deliberative targeting process that serves to minimize unintentional casualties. But the weapons employed by drones are usually identical to those used via manned aircraft and can still kill civilians—creating enmity that breeds more terrorists.<br/>Yet many insurgents and terrorists have been taken off the battlefield by U.S. drones and special-operations forces. Besides Mehsud, the list includes Anwar al-Awlaki of al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula; al-Qaida deputy leader Abu Yahya al-Li-bi; and, of course, al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden. Given that list, it is possible that the drone program has prevented numerous attacks by their potential followers, like Shazad.<br/>What does the removal of al-Qaida leadership mean for U.S. national security? Though many in al-Qaida’s senior leadership cadre remain, the historical record suggests that "decapitation" will likely weaken the organization and could cripple its ability to conduct major attacks on the U.S. homeland.<br/>Killing terrorist leaders is not necessarily a knockout blow, but can make it harder for terrorists to attack the U.S. Members of al-Qaida’s central leadership, once safely amassed in northwestern Pakistan while America shifted its focus to Iraq, have been killed, captured, forced underground or scattered to various locations with little ability to communicate or move securely.<br/>Recently declassified correspondence seized in the bin Laden raid shows that the relentless pressure from the drone campaign on al-Qaida in Pakistan led bin Laden to advise al-Qaida operatives to leave Pakistan’s Tribal Areas as no longer safe. Bin Laden’s letters show that U.S. counterterrorism actions, which had forced him into self-imposed exile, had made running the organization not only more risky, but also more difficult.<br/>As al-Qaida members trickle out of Pakistan and seek sanctuary elsewhere, the U.S. military is ramping up its counterterrorism operations in Somalia and Yemen, while continuing its drone campaign in Pakistan. Despite its controversial nature, the U.S. counter-terrorism strategy has demonstrated a degree of effectiveness.<br/>The Obama administration is committed to reducing the size of the U.S. military’s footprint overseas by relying on drones, special operations forces, and other intelligence capabilities.

groups attacking U.S. interests in the region and beyond, drones will remain an essential tool for fighting global terrorism. Numbering over three hundred and fifty since 2004, drone strikes in Pakistan have killed more than two dozen Al Qaeda operatives and hundreds of militants targeting U.S. and coalition forces.<br/>President Obama made clear in his May 23 speech at the National Defense University that <br/>AND<br/>that by preemptively striking at terrorists, many innocent lives had been saved.<br/>The most compelling evidence of the efficacy of the drone program came from Osama bin Laden himself, who shortly before his death contemplated moving Al Qaeda operatives from Pakistan into forested areas of Afghanistan in an attempt to escape the drones’ reach, according to Peter Bergen, renowned author of Manhunt: The Ten-Year Search for Bin Laden from 9/11 to Abbottabad.<br/>How to Reduce the Need for Drones<br/>The continuation of drone strikes signals U.S. frustration with Pakistan’s unwillingness to crack down consistently and comprehensively on groups that find sanctuary in Pakistan’s tribal areas. There continue to be close ties between the Pakistan military and the Taliban-allied Haqqani Network, which attacks U.S. forces in Afghanistan and undermines the overall U.S. and NATO strategy there.<br/>The most recent U.S. drone attack inside Pakistani territory occurred last week against militants from the Haqqani Network located in North Waziristan, along the border with Afghanistan. In early June, drone missiles also targeted a group of fighters in Pakistan that were preparing to cross over into Afghanistan. On both occasions, the Pakistani Foreign Ministry condemned the attacks as counterproductive and said they raised serious questions about human rights.<br/>No doubt a better alternative to the drones would be Pakistani action against terrorist sanctuaries. But Pakistan has stonewalled repeated U.S. requests for operations against the Haqqani network.<br/>In addition to continuing drone strikes as necessary, the U.S. should further condition military aid to Pakistan based on its willingness to crack down on the Haqqani Network. In early June, the House of Representatives approved language in the FY 2014 National Defense Authorization Act that conditions reimbursement of Coalition Support Funds (CSF) pending Pakistani actions against the Haqqani network. Hopefully, the language will be retained in the final bill.<br/>The United States provides CSF funds to reimburse Pakistan for the costs associated with stationing some one hundred thousand Pakistani troops along the border with Afghanistan. Pakistan has received over 2410 billion in CSF funding over the last decade. One must question the worth of having troops stationed in this region if they refuse to go after one of the most dangerous terrorist groups.<br/>Details of the relationship between the Pakistan military and the Haqqani Network are laid out <br/>AND<br/>helps to sustain the Haqqani group and enhance its effectiveness on the battlefield.<br/>Drones Help Pakistan<br/>It is no secret that the drone strikes often benefit the Pakistani state. On <br/>AND<br/>-up to the May elections, declaring a goal of killing democracy.<br/>Complicating the picture even further is the fact that Pakistan’s support for the Haqqani network indirectly benefits the Pakistani Taliban. The Haqqanis play a pivotal role in the region by simultaneously maintaining ties with Al Qaeda, Pakistani intelligence and anti-Pakistan groups like the TTP. With such a confused and self-defeating Pakistani strategy, Washington has no choice but to rely on the judicious use of drone strikes.<br/>Complicated Relationship<br/>The U.S. will need to keep a close eye on the tribal <br/>AND<br/>will remain of vital strategic interest for Washington for many years to come.<br/>Though the drone issue will continue to be a source of tension in the relationship, it is doubtful that it alone would derail ties. The extent to which the United States will continue to rely on drone strikes ultimately depends on Islamabad’s willingness to develop more decisive and comprehensive counterterrorism policies that include targeting groups like the Haqqani Network.</p><p>Extinction<br/>William Pitt 9 is a New York Times and internationally bestselling author of two books: "War on Iraq: What Team Bush Doesn’t Want You to Know" and "The Greatest Sedition Is Silence", 5/8, "Unstable Pakistan Threatens the World," <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.arabamericannews.com/news/index.php?mod=article26cat=commentary26article=2183  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.arabamericannews.com/news/index.php?mod=article26cat=commentary26article=2183%27" tppabs="http://www.arabamericannews.com/news/index.php?mod=article26cat=commentary26article=2183"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.arabamericannews.com/news/index.php?mod=article26cat=commentary26article=2183</span></a></span>,&nbsp;</p><p>But a suicide bomber in Pakistan rammed a car packed with explosives into a jeep <br/>AND<br/>Pakistan, however, needs to be placed immediately on the front burner.&nbsp;</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h2 id="HPlan-5" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Plan</span></h2><p>Plan: The United States Federal Government should restrict executive authority for targeted killing as a first resort outside zones of active hostilities.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h2 id="HSolvency-3" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Solvency</span></h2><p>CONTENTION FOUR: SOLVENCY</p><p>Plan’s mechanism is key to consensus-building on targeted killing norms<br/>Jennifer Daskal, Fellow and Adjunct Professor, Georgetown Center on National Security and the Law, Georgetown University Law Center, April 2013, ARTICLE: THE GEOGRAPHY OF THE BATTLEFIELD: A FRAMEWORK FOR DETENTION AND TARGETING OUTSIDE THE "HOT" CONFLICT ZONE, 161 U.

There are, however, several reasons why doing so would be in the United States’ best interest.<br/>First, as described in Section II.B, the general framework is largely consistent with current U.S. practice since 2006. The United States has, as a matter of policy, adopted important limits on its use of out-of-battlefield targeting and law-of-war detention suggesting an implicit recognition of the value and benefits of restraint.<br/>Second, while the proposed substantive and procedural safeguards are more stringent than those that <br/>AND<br/>detention without charge and targeted killing can yield legitimacy and security benefits. n218<br/>Third, limiting the exercise of these authorities outside zones of active hostilities better accommodates <br/>AND<br/>development of an international consensus as to the rules that ought to apply.<br/>Fourth, such self-imposed restrictions are more consistent with the United States’ long-standing role as a champion of human rights and the rule of law a role that becomes difficult for the United States to play when viewed as supporting broad-based law-of-war authority that gives it wide latitude to employ force as a first resort and bypass otherwise applicable human rights and domestic law enforcement norms.<br/>Fifth, and critically, while the United States might be confident that it will <br/>AND<br/>American citizen, the United States would have few principled grounds for objecting.</p><p>Congressional restriction key to credibility and signal<br/>Kenneth Anderson, Professor of Law, Washington College of Law, American University, and Research Fellow, The Hoover Institution, Stanford University and Member of its Task Force on National Security and the Law, 5/11/2009, Targeted Killing in U.S. Counterterrorism Strategy and Law, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.brookings.edu/~~/media/research/files/papers/2009/5/1120counterterrorism20anderson/0511_counterterrorism_anderson.pdf  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.brookings.edu/~~/media/research/files/papers/2009/5/1120counterterrorism20anderson/0511_counterterrorism_anderson.pdf%27" tppabs="http://www.brookings.edu/~~/media/research/files/papers/2009/5/1120counterterrorism20anderson/0511_counterterrorism_anderson.pdf"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.brookings.edu/~~/media/research/files/papers/2009/5/1120counterterrorism20anderson/0511_counterterrorism_anderson.pdf</span></a></span></p><p>What Should Congress Do?<br/>Does this analysis offer any practical policy prescriptions for Congress and the administration?

Not toys or models, but real flying machines.<br/>It’s a classic and common phase in the life cycle of a military innovation: <br/>AND<br/>the United States; it’s a precedent Washington does not want anyone following.<br/>America, the world’s leading democracy and a country built on a legal and moral framework unlike any other, has adopted a war-making process that too often bypasses its traditional, regimented, and rigorously overseen military in favor of a secret program never publicly discussed, based on legal advice never properly vetted. The Obama administration has used its executive power to refuse or outright ignore requests by congressional overseers, and it has resisted monitoring by federal courts.<br/>To implement this covert program, the administration has adopted a tool that lowers the <br/>AND<br/>-states involved but also destabilize entire regions and potentially upset geopolitical order.<br/>Hyperbole? Consider this: Iran, with the approval of Damascus, carries out <br/>AND<br/>learned it by watching you. In Pakistan, Yemen, and Afghanistan.<br/>This is the unintended consequence of American drone warfare. For all of the attention <br/>AND<br/>uses of one of the most awesome military robotics capabilities of this generation.<br/>THE WRONG QUESTION <br/>The United States is the indisputable leader in drone technology and long-range strike<br/>AND<br/>billions of dollars that have gone into establishing and maintaining such a capability.<br/>That level of superiority leads some national security officials to downplay concerns about other nations’ <br/>AND<br/>the unparalleled intelligence-collection and data-analysis underpinning the aircraft’s mission.<br/>"There is what I think is just an unconstrained focus on a tool as <br/>AND<br/>who are interpreting the information that’s coming off the sensors on the aircraft."<br/>The analysts are part of the global architecture that makes precision strikes, and targeted <br/>AND<br/>) outweigh the reward (judged by the value of the threat eliminated).<br/>"Is that a shovel or a rifle? Is that a Taliban member or <br/>AND<br/>. We can orbit long enough to be pretty sure about our target."<br/>Other countries, groups, and even individuals can and do fly drones. But no state or group has nearly the sophisticated network of intelligence and data analysis that gives the United States its strategic advantage. Although it would be foolish to dismiss the notion that potential U.S. adversaries aspire to attain that type of war-from-afar, pinpoint-strike capability, they have neither the income nor the perceived need to do so.<br/>That’s true, at least today. It’s also irrelevant. Others who employ drones are likely to carry a different agenda, one more concerned with employing a relatively inexpensive and ruthlessly efficient tool to dispatch an enemy close at hand.<br/>"It would be very difficult for them to create the global-strike architecture <br/>AND<br/>long-duration surveillance and potentially strike inside and right on its border."<br/>And that’s a NATO ally seeking the capability to conduct missions that would run afoul <br/>AND<br/>uses the aircraft to strike Lashkar-e-Taiba militants near Kashmir?<br/>"We don’t like other states using lethal force outside their borders. It’s destabilizing. It can lead to a sort of wider escalation of violence between two states," said Micah Zenko, a security policy and drone expert at the Council on Foreign Relations. "So the proliferation of drones is not just about the protection of the United States. It’s primarily about the likelihood that other states will increasingly use lethal force outside of their borders."<br/>LOWERING THE BAR<br/>Governments have covertly killed for ages, whether they maintained an official hit list or <br/>AND<br/>American security experts point to Russia as well, although Moscow disputes this.<br/>In the 1960s, the U.S. government was involved to differing levels <br/>AND<br/>late as 2001, Washington’s stated policy was to oppose Israel’s targeted killings.)<br/>When America adopted targeted killing again—first under the Bush administration after the September 11 attacks and then expanded by President Obama—the tools of the trade had changed. No longer was the CIA sending poison, pistols, and toxic cigars to assets overseas to kill enemy leaders. Now it could target people throughout al-Qaida’s hierarchy with accuracy, deliver lethal ordnance literally around the world, and watch the mission’s completion in real time.<br/>The United States is smartly using technology to improve combat efficacy, and to make <br/>AND<br/>, defense hawks and spendthrifts alike would criticize it if it did not.<br/>"If you believe that these folks are legitimate terrorists who are committing acts of <br/>AND<br/>Do we have the debate if an aircraft pilot drops a particular bomb?"<br/>But defense analysts argue—and military officials concede—there is a qualitative difference <br/>AND<br/>States would not have pursued an equivalent number of manned strikes in Pakistan.<br/>And what’s true for the United States will be true as well for other countries that own and arm remote piloted aircraft.<br/>"The drones—the responsiveness, the persistence, and without putting your personnel at risk—is what makes it a different technology," Zenko said. "When other states have this technology, if they follow U.S. practice, it will lower the threshold for their uses of lethal force outside their borders.

Except in situations where leaks help it tell a politically expedient story of its skill at killing bad guys, the administration has done little to make a case to the public and the world at large for its use of armed drones.<br/>Already, what’s become apparent is that the White House is not interested in changing <br/>AND<br/>largely off the table now, according to intelligence officials and committee members.<br/>Under discussion within the administration and on Capitol Hill is a potential program takeover by <br/>AND<br/>provide no guarantee of greater transparency for the public, or even Congress.<br/>And if the administration is not willing to share with lawmakers who are security-cleared to know, it certainly is not prepared to engage in a sensitive discussion, even among allies, that might begin to set the rules on use for a technology that could upend stability in already fragile and strategically significant places around the globe.

The Rule of Law <br/>At root, the idea of "rule of law" is fairly simple, <br/>AND<br/>processes and rules that reflect basic notions of justice, humanity and fairness.<br/>Precisely what constitutes a fair process is debatable, but most would agree that at <br/>AND<br/>Civil and Political Rights, to which the United States is a party.<br/>In ordinary circumstances, this bundle of universally acknowledged rights (together with international law <br/>AND<br/>States government called this an act of murder—an unlawful political assassination.<br/>B. Targeted Killing and the Law of Armed Conflict<br/>Of course, sometimes the "ordinary" legal rules do not apply. In <br/>AND<br/>the principles of necessity, humanity, proportionality,29 and distinction.30<br/>It is worth briefly explaining these principles. The principle of necessity requires parties to <br/>AND<br/>in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage expected to be gained.<br/>Finally, the principle of discrimination or distinction requires that parties to a conflict direct their actions only against combatants and military objectives, and take appropriate steps to distinguish between combatants and non-combatants.31<br/>This is a radical oversimplification of a very complex body of law.32 But <br/>AND<br/>by military necessity34 — but there are far fewer constraints on state behavior.<br/>Technically, the law of war is referred to using the Latin term "lex specialis" – special law. It is applicable in—and only in — special circumstances (in this case, armed conflict), and in those special circumstances, it supersedes "ordinary law," or "lex generalis," the "general law" that prevails in peacetime. We have one set of laws for "normal" situations, and another, more flexible set of laws for "extraordinary" situations, such as armed conflicts.<br/>None of this poses any inherent problem for the rule of law. Having one body of rules that tightly restricts the use of force and another body of rules that is far more permissive does not fundamentally undermine the rule of law, as long as we have a reasonable degree of consensus on what circumstances trigger the "special" law, and as long as the "special law" doesn’t end up undermining the general law.<br/>To put it a little differently, war, with its very different rules, <br/>AND<br/>, and between places where there’s war and places where there’s no war.<br/>Let me return now to the question of drones and targeted killings. When all <br/>AND<br/>Libyan military targets is no more controversial than the use of manned aircraft.<br/>That is because our core rule of law concerns have mostly been satisfied: we <br/>AND<br/>in the event of error or abuse (the various governments involved).35<br/>Once you take targeted killings outside hot battlefields, it’s a different story. The <br/>AND<br/>any time — with regard to any person the administration deems a combatant.<br/>The trouble is, no one outside a very small group within the US executive <br/>AND<br/>of the time, the US will not even officially acknowledge targeted killings.<br/>This leaves all the key rule-of-law questions related to the ongoing <br/>AND<br/>determinations, and what is the precise chain of command for such decisions?<br/>I think the rule of law problem here is obvious: when "armed conflict<br/>AND<br/>are they, as some human rights groups have argued, unlawful murder?<br/>C. Targeted Killing and the International Law of Self-Defense <br/>When faced with criticisms of the law of war framework as a justification for targeted <br/>AND<br/>that the defensive force used is otherwise consistent with law of war principles.<br/>Like law of war-based arguments, this general principle is superficially uncontroversial: if someone overseas is about to launch a nuclear weapon at New York City, no one can doubt that the United States has a perfect right (and the president has a constitutional duty) to use force if needed to prevent that attack, regardless of the attacker’s nationality.<br/>But once again, the devil is in the details. To start with, what constitutes an "imminent" threat? Traditionally, both international law and domestic criminal law understand that term narrowly: 37 to be "imminent," a threat cannot be distant or speculative.38 But much like the Bush Administration before it, the Obama Administration has put forward an interpretation of the word "imminent" that bears little relation to traditional legal concepts.<br/>According to a leaked 2011 Justice Department white paper39—the most detailed legal justification that has yet become public— the requirement of imminence "does not require the United States to have clear evidence that a specific attack on U.S. persons and interests will take place in the immediate future." This seems, in itself, like a substantial departure from accepted international law definitions of imminence.<br/>But the White Paper goes even further, stating that "certain members of al <br/>AND<br/>identity or status (a familiar part of the law of armed conflict).<br/>That concept of imminence has been called Orwellian, and although that is an overused epithet, in this context it seems fairly appropriate. According to the Obama Administration, "imminent" no longer means "immediate," and in fact the very absence of clear evidence indicating specific present or future attack plans becomes, paradoxically, the basis for assuming that attack may perpetually be "imminent."<br/>The 2011 Justice Department White Paper notes that the use of force in self-defense must comply with general law of war principles of necessity, proportionality, humanity, and distinction. The White Paper offers no guidance on the specific criteria for determining when an individual is a combatant (or a civilian participating directly in hostilities), however. It also offers no guidance on how to determine if a use of force is necessary or proportionate.<br/>From a traditional international law perspective, this necessity and proportionality inquiry relates both to <br/>AND<br/>American citizen abroad — or against non-citizens, for that matter?<br/>As I have noted, it is impossible for outsiders to fully evaluate US drone strikes, since so much vital information remains classified. In most cases, we know little about the identities; activities or future plans of those targeted. Nevertheless, given the increased frequency of US targeted killings in recent years, it seems reasonable to wonder whether the Administration conducts a rigorous necessity or proportionality analysis in all cases.<br/>So far, the leaked 2011 Justice Department White Paper represents the most detailed legal <br/>AND<br/>citizens are less exacting than those the Administration views as applicable to citizens.<br/>Defenders of administration targeted killing policy acknowledge that the criteria for determining how to answer these many questions have not been made public, but insist that this should not be cause for concern. The Administration has reportedly developed a detailed "playbook" outlining the targeting criteria and procedures,40, and insiders insist that executive branch officials go through an elaborate process in which they carefully consider every possible issue before determining that a drone strike is lawful.41<br/>No doubt they do, but this is somewhat cold comfort. Formal processes tend to further normalize once-exceptional activities — and "trust us" is a rather shaky foundation for the rule of law. Indeed, the whole point of the rule of law is that individual lives and freedom should not depend solely on the good faith and benevolence of government officials.<br/>As with law of war arguments, stating that US targeted killings are clearly legal under traditional self-defense principles requires some significant cognitive dissonance. Law exists to restrain untrammeled power. It is no doubt possible to make a plausible legal argument justifying each and every U.S. drone strike — but this merely suggests that we are working with a legal framework that has begun to outlive its usefulness.<br/>The real question isn’t whether U.S. drone strikes are "legal." The real question is this: Do we really want to live in a world in which the U.S. government’s justification for killing is so malleable?<br/>5. Setting Troubling International Precedents<br/>Here is an additional reason to worry about the U.S. overreliance on <br/>AND<br/>human rights records, such as Russia and China—are taking notice.<br/>Right now, the United States has a decided technological advantage when it comes to <br/>AND<br/>for how to foment instability and –literally — get away with murder.<br/>Take the issue of sovereignty. Sovereignty has long been a core concept of the <br/>AND<br/>or in self-defense "in the event of an armed attack."<br/>The 2011 Justice Department White Paper asserts that targeted killings carried out by the United <br/>AND<br/>unable" to suppress that threat, the logic is in fact circular.<br/>It goes like this: The United States — using its own malleable definition of <br/>AND<br/>posed by Person X and the use of force again presents no problem.<br/>This is a legal theory that more or less eviscerates traditional notions of sovereignty, <br/>AND<br/>them to justify the killing of dissidents, rivals, or unwanted minorities?</p><p>Collapse of zone of conflict clarity results in escalatory war and miscalaculation<br/><strong>Dean 13</strong><br/>Adriana Dean, University of Southern California in Philosophy, Politics and Law, 2013, Targeted Killings Behind the Veil of Ignorance, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.academia.edu/3832442/Targeted_Killings_Behind_the_Veil_of_Ignorance  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.academia.edu/3832442/Targeted_Killings_Behind_the_Veil_of_Ignorance%27" tppabs="http://www.academia.edu/3832442/Targeted_Killings_Behind_the_Veil_of_Ignorance"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.academia.edu/3832442/Targeted_Killings_Behind_the_Veil_of_Ignorance</span></a></span></p><p>While there are some justifiable points for the targeted killing program that individuals behind the <br/>AND<br/>that certain components and the resulting implications of the program are categorically unfair.&nbsp;</p><p>Those conflicts go nuclear<br/>Michael J <strong>Boyle 13</strong>, Assistant Professor of Political Science at La Salle University, former Lecturer in International Relations and Research Fellow at the Centre for the Study of Terrorism and Political Violence at the University of St Andrews, PhD from Cambridge University, January 2013, "The costs and consequences of drone warfare," International Affairs 89: 1 (2013) 1–29, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/public/International20Affairs/2013/89_1/89_1Boyle.pdf  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/public/International20Affairs/2013/89_1/89_1Boyle.pdf%27" tppabs="http://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/public/International20Affairs/2013/89_1/89_1Boyle.pdf"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/public/International20Affairs/2013/89_1/89_1Boyle.pdf</span></a></span></p><p>A second consequence of the spread of drones is that many of the traditional concepts <br/>AND<br/>powers, thus magnifying the risks of a spiral of conflict between them.</p><p>Drones cause SCS and ECS conflict – US precedent is key<br/><strong>Bodeen 13</strong> (Christopher, Beijing correspondent for The Associated Press, 5/3/2013, "China’s Drone Program Appears To Be Moving Into Overdrive", www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/03/china-drone-program_n_3207392.html)<br/> <br/>Chinese aerospace firms have developed dozens of drones, known also as unmanned aerial vehicles<br/>AND<br/>rapidly and on the cusp of widespread use for surveillance and combat strikes.<br/>"My sense is that China is moving into large-scale deployments of UAVs," said Ian Easton, co-author of a recent report on Chinese drones for the Project 2049 Institute security think tank.<br/>China’s move into large-scale drone deployment displays its military’s growing sophistication and could challenge U.S. military dominance in the Asia-Pacific. It also could elevate the threat to neighbors with territorial disputes with Beijing, including Vietnam, Japan, India and the Philippines. China says its drones are capable of carrying bombs and missiles as well as conducting reconnaissance, potentially turning them into offensive weapons in a border conflict.<br/>China’s increased use of drones also adds to concerns about the lack of internationally recognized standards for drone attacks. The United States has widely employed drones as a means of eliminating terror suspects in Pakistan and the Arabian Peninsula.<br/>"China is following the precedent set by the U.S. The thinking is that, `If the U.S. can do it, so can we. They’re a big country with security interests and so are we’," said Siemon Wezeman, a senior fellow at the arms transfers program at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute in Sweden, or SIPRI.<br/>"The justification for an attack would be that Beijing too has a responsibility for the safety of its citizens. There needs to be agreement on what the limits are," he said.<br/>Though China claims its military posture is entirely defensive, its navy and civilian maritime services have engaged in repeated standoffs with ships from other nations in the South China and East China seas. India, meanwhile, says Chinese troops have set up camp almost 20 kilometers (12 miles) into Indian-claimed territory.<br/>It isn’t yet known exactly what China’s latest drones are capable of, because, like most Chinese equipment, they remain untested in battle.<br/>The military and associated aerospace firms have offered little information, although in an interview last month with the official Xinhua News Agency, Yang Baikui, chief designer at plane maker COSIC, said Chinese drones were closing the gap but still needed to progress in half a dozen major areas, from airframe design to digital linkups.<br/>Executives at COSIC and drone makers ASN, Avic, and the 611 Institute declined to be interviewed by The Associated Press, citing their military links. The Defense Ministry’s latest report on the status of the military released in mid-April made no mention of drones, and spokesman Yang Yujun made only the barest acknowledgement of their existence in response to a question.<br/>"Drones are a new high-tech form of weaponry employed and used by many militaries around the world," Yang said. "China’s armed forces are developing weaponry and equipment for the purpose of upholding territorial integrity, national security and world peace. It will pose no threat to any country."<br/>Drones are already patrolling China’s borders, and a navy drone was deployed to the western province of Sichuan to provide aerial surveillance following last month’s deadly earthquake there.<br/>They may also soon be appearing over China’s maritime claims, including Japanese-controlled East China Sea islands that China considers its own. That could sharpen tensions in an area where Chinese and Japanese patrol boats already confront each other on a regular basis and Japan frequently scrambles fighters to tail Chinese manned aircraft.</p><p>SCS conflict causes extinction<br/><strong>Wittner 11</strong> (Lawrence S.

Johnston is an associate political scientist at the RAND Corporation, a nonprofit, nonpartisan research institution. He is the author of "Does Decapitation Work? Assessing the Effectiveness of Leadership Targeting in Counterinsurgency Campaigns," published in International Security (Spring 2012)., 8/22/2012, "Drone Strikes Keep Pressure on al-Qaida", www.rand.org/blog/2012/08/drone-strikes-keep-pressure-on-al-qaida.html)</p><p>Should the U.S. continue to strike at al-Qaida’s leadership with drone attacks? A recent poll shows that while most Americans approve of drone strikes, in 17 out of 20 countries, more than half of those surveyed disapprove of them.<br/>My study of leadership decapitation in 90 counter-insurgencies since the 1970s shows that when militant leaders are captured or killed militant attacks decrease, terrorist campaigns end sooner, and their outcomes tend to favor the government or third-party country, not the militants.<br/>Those opposed to drone strikes often cite the June 2009 one that targeted Pakistani Taliban <br/>AND<br/>cited drone strikes as a key motivation for his May 2010 attempted attack.<br/>Compared to manned aircraft, drones have some advantages as counter-insurgency tools, such as lower costs, longer endurance and the lack of a pilot to place in harm’s way and risk of capture. These characteristics can enable a more deliberative targeting process that serves to minimize unintentional casualties. But the weapons employed by drones are usually identical to those used via manned aircraft and can still kill civilians—creating enmity that breeds more terrorists.<br/>Yet many insurgents and terrorists have been taken off the battlefield by U.S. drones and special-operations forces. Besides Mehsud, the list includes Anwar al-Awlaki of al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula; al-Qaida deputy leader Abu Yahya al-Li-bi; and, of course, al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden. Given that list, it is possible that the drone program has prevented numerous attacks by their potential followers, like Shazad.<br/>What does the removal of al-Qaida leadership mean for U.S. national security? Though many in al-Qaida’s senior leadership cadre remain, the historical record suggests that "decapitation" will likely weaken the organization and could cripple its ability to conduct major attacks on the U.S. homeland.<br/>Killing terrorist leaders is not necessarily a knockout blow, but can make it harder for terrorists to attack the U.S. Members of al-Qaida’s central leadership, once safely amassed in northwestern Pakistan while America shifted its focus to Iraq, have been killed, captured, forced underground or scattered to various locations with little ability to communicate or move securely.<br/>Recently declassified correspondence seized in the bin Laden raid shows that the relentless pressure from the drone campaign on al-Qaida in Pakistan led bin Laden to advise al-Qaida operatives to leave Pakistan’s Tribal Areas as no longer safe. Bin Laden’s letters show that U.S. counterterrorism actions, which had forced him into self-imposed exile, had made running the organization not only more risky, but also more difficult.<br/>As al-Qaida members trickle out of Pakistan and seek sanctuary elsewhere, the U.S. military is ramping up its counterterrorism operations in Somalia and Yemen, while continuing its drone campaign in Pakistan. Despite its controversial nature, the U.S. counter-terrorism strategy has demonstrated a degree of effectiveness.<br/>The Obama administration is committed to reducing the size of the U.S. military’s footprint overseas by relying on drones, special operations forces, and other intelligence capabilities. These methods have made it more difficult for al-Qaida remnants to reconstitute a new safe haven, as Osama bin Laden did in Afghanistan in 1996, after his ouster from Sudan.</p><p>Decapitation works—-studies<br/><strong>Johnston 12</strong> (Patrick B.

groups attacking U.S. interests in the region and beyond, drones will remain an essential tool for fighting global terrorism. Numbering over three hundred and fifty since 2004, drone strikes in Pakistan have killed more than two dozen Al Qaeda operatives and hundreds of militants targeting U.S. and coalition forces.<br/>President Obama made clear in his May 23 speech at the National Defense University that <br/>AND<br/>that by preemptively striking at terrorists, many innocent lives had been saved.<br/>The most compelling evidence of the efficacy of the drone program came from Osama bin Laden himself, who shortly before his death contemplated moving Al Qaeda operatives from Pakistan into forested areas of Afghanistan in an attempt to escape the drones’ reach, according to Peter Bergen, renowned author of Manhunt: The Ten-Year Search for Bin Laden from 9/11 to Abbottabad.<br/>How to Reduce the Need for Drones<br/>The continuation of drone strikes signals U.S. frustration with Pakistan’s unwillingness to crack down consistently and comprehensively on groups that find sanctuary in Pakistan’s tribal areas. There continue to be close ties between the Pakistan military and the Taliban-allied Haqqani Network, which attacks U.S. forces in Afghanistan and undermines the overall U.S. and NATO strategy there.<br/>The most recent U.S. drone attack inside Pakistani territory occurred last week against militants from the Haqqani Network located in North Waziristan, along the border with Afghanistan. In early June, drone missiles also targeted a group of fighters in Pakistan that were preparing to cross over into Afghanistan. On both occasions, the Pakistani Foreign Ministry condemned the attacks as counterproductive and said they raised serious questions about human rights.<br/>No doubt a better alternative to the drones would be Pakistani action against terrorist sanctuaries. But Pakistan has stonewalled repeated U.S. requests for operations against the Haqqani network.<br/>In addition to continuing drone strikes as necessary, the U.S. should further condition military aid to Pakistan based on its willingness to crack down on the Haqqani Network. In early June, the House of Representatives approved language in the FY 2014 National Defense Authorization Act that conditions reimbursement of Coalition Support Funds (CSF) pending Pakistani actions against the Haqqani network. Hopefully, the language will be retained in the final bill.<br/>The United States provides CSF funds to reimburse Pakistan for the costs associated with stationing some one hundred thousand Pakistani troops along the border with Afghanistan. Pakistan has received over 2410 billion in CSF funding over the last decade. One must question the worth of having troops stationed in this region if they refuse to go after one of the most dangerous terrorist groups.<br/>Details of the relationship between the Pakistan military and the Haqqani Network are laid out <br/>AND<br/>helps to sustain the Haqqani group and enhance its effectiveness on the battlefield.<br/>Drones Help Pakistan<br/>It is no secret that the drone strikes often benefit the Pakistani state. On <br/>AND<br/>-up to the May elections, declaring a goal of killing democracy.<br/>Complicating the picture even further is the fact that Pakistan’s support for the Haqqani network indirectly benefits the Pakistani Taliban. The Haqqanis play a pivotal role in the region by simultaneously maintaining ties with Al Qaeda, Pakistani intelligence and anti-Pakistan groups like the TTP. With such a confused and self-defeating Pakistani strategy, Washington has no choice but to rely on the judicious use of drone strikes.<br/>Complicated Relationship<br/>The U.S. will need to keep a close eye on the tribal <br/>AND<br/>will remain of vital strategic interest for Washington for many years to come.<br/>Though the drone issue will continue to be a source of tension in the relationship, it is doubtful that it alone would derail ties. The extent to which the United States will continue to rely on drone strikes ultimately depends on Islamabad’s willingness to develop more decisive and comprehensive counterterrorism policies that include targeting groups like the Haqqani Network.</p><p>Extinction<br/>William Pitt 9 is a New York Times and internationally bestselling author of two books: "War on Iraq: What Team Bush Doesn’t Want You to Know" and "The Greatest Sedition Is Silence", 5/8, "Unstable Pakistan Threatens the World," <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.arabamericannews.com/news/index.php?mod=article26cat=commentary26article=2183  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.arabamericannews.com/news/index.php?mod=article26cat=commentary26article=2183%27" tppabs="http://www.arabamericannews.com/news/index.php?mod=article26cat=commentary26article=2183"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.arabamericannews.com/news/index.php?mod=article26cat=commentary26article=2183</span></a></span>,&nbsp;</p><p>But a suicide bomber in Pakistan rammed a car packed with explosives into a jeep <br/>AND<br/>Pakistan, however, needs to be placed immediately on the front burner.&nbsp;</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h2 id="HPlan-6" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Plan</span></h2><p>Plan: The United States Federal Government should restrict executive authority for targeted killing as a first resort outside zones of active hostilities.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h2 id="HSolvency-4" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Solvency</span></h2><p>CONTENTION FOUR: SOLVENCY</p><p>Plan’s mechanism is key to consensus-building on targeted killing norms<br/>Jennifer Daskal, Fellow and Adjunct Professor, Georgetown Center on National Security and the Law, Georgetown University Law Center, April 2013, ARTICLE: THE GEOGRAPHY OF THE BATTLEFIELD: A FRAMEWORK FOR DETENTION AND TARGETING OUTSIDE THE "HOT" CONFLICT ZONE, 161 U.

The United States has, as a matter of policy, adopted important limits on its use of out-of-battlefield targeting and law-of-war detention suggesting an implicit recognition of the value and benefits of restraint.<br/>Second, while the proposed substantive and procedural safeguards are more stringent than those that <br/>AND<br/>detention without charge and targeted killing can yield legitimacy and security benefits. n218<br/>Third, limiting the exercise of these authorities outside zones of active hostilities better accommodates <br/>AND<br/>development of an international consensus as to the rules that ought to apply.<br/>Fourth, such self-imposed restrictions are more consistent with the United States’ long-standing role as a champion of human rights and the rule of law a role that becomes difficult for the United States to play when viewed as supporting broad-based law-of-war authority that gives it wide latitude to employ force as a first resort and bypass otherwise applicable human rights and domestic law enforcement norms.<br/>Fifth, and critically, while the United States might be confident that it will <br/>AND<br/>American citizen, the United States would have few principled grounds for objecting.</p><p>Congressional restriction key to credibility and signal<br/>Kenneth Anderson, Professor of Law, Washington College of Law, American University, and Research Fellow, The Hoover Institution, Stanford University and Member of its Task Force on National Security and the Law, 5/11/2009, Targeted Killing in U.S. Counterterrorism Strategy and Law, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.brookings.edu/~~/media/research/files/papers/2009/5/1120counterterrorism20anderson/0511_counterterrorism_anderson.pdf  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.brookings.edu/~~/media/research/files/papers/2009/5/1120counterterrorism20anderson/0511_counterterrorism_anderson.pdf%27" tppabs="http://www.brookings.edu/~~/media/research/files/papers/2009/5/1120counterterrorism20anderson/0511_counterterrorism_anderson.pdf"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.brookings.edu/~~/media/research/files/papers/2009/5/1120counterterrorism20anderson/0511_counterterrorism_anderson.pdf</span></a></span></p><p>What Should Congress Do?<br/>Does this analysis offer any practical policy prescriptions for Congress and the administration?

So don’t be too surprised if the US and Japan go to war with China next year over the uninhabited rocks that Japan calls the Senkakus and China calls the Diaoyu islands. And don’t assume the war would be contained and short.<br/>Of course we should all hope that common sense prevails.<br/>It seems almost laughably unthinkable that the world’s three richest countries - two of them <br/>AND<br/>wealth and power of Athens, and the fear this caused in Sparta.<br/>The analogy with Asia today is uncomfortably close and not at all reassuring. No one in 431BC really wanted a war, but when Athens threatened one of Sparta’s allies over a disputed colony, the Spartans felt they had to intervene. They feared that to step back in the face of Athens’ growing power would fatally compromise Sparta’s position in the Greek world, and concede supremacy to Athens.<br/>The Senkakus issue is likewise a symptom of tensions whose cause lies elsewhere, in China’s growing challenge to America’s long-standing leadership in Asia, and America’s response. In the past few years China has become both markedly stronger and notably more assertive. America has countered with the strategic pivot to Asia. Now, China is pushing back against President Barack Obama’s pivot by targeting Japan in the Senkakus.<br/>The Japanese themselves genuinely fear that China will become even more overbearing as its strength grows, and they depend on America to protect them. But they also worry whether they can rely on Washington as China becomes more formidable. China’s ratcheting pressure over the Senkakus strikes at both these anxieties.<br/>The push and shove over the islands has been escalating for months. Just before Japan’s recent election, China flew surveillance aircraft over the islands for the first time, and since the election both sides have reiterated their tough talk.<br/>Where will it end? The risk is that, without a clear circuit-breaker, the escalation will continue until at some point shots are exchanged, and a spiral to war begins that no one can stop. Neither side could win such a war, and it would be devastating not just for them but for the rest of us.<br/>No one wants this, but the crisis will not stop by itself. One side or other, or both, will have to take positive steps to break the cycle of action and reaction. This will be difficult, because any concession by either side would so easily be seen as a backdown, with huge domestic political costs and international implications.<br/>It would therefore need real political strength and skill, which is in short supply all round - especially in Tokyo and Beijing, which both have new and untested leaders. And each side apparently hopes that they will not have to face this test, because they expect the other side will back down first.<br/>Beijing apparently believes that if it keeps pushing, Washington will persuade Tokyo to make concessions over the disputed islands in order to avoid being dragged into a war with China, which would be a big win for them. Tokyo on the other hand fervently hopes that, faced with firm US support for Japan, China will have no choice but to back down.<br/>And in Washington, too, most people seem to think China will back off. They argue that China needs America more than America needs China, and that Beijing will back down rather than risk a break with the US which would devastate China’s economy.<br/>Unfortunately, the Chinese seem to see things differently. They believe America will not risk a break with China because America’s economy would suffer so much.<br/>These mutual misconceptions carry the seeds of a terrible miscalculation, as each side underestimates <br/>AND<br/>the kind of issues that great powers have often gone to war over.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h2 id="HTerror-3" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Terror</span></h2><p>Wrong<br/><strong>Hoffman 13</strong> (Bruce, director of the Center for Security Studies at Georgetown University’s Walsh School of Foreign Service, 17 July 2013, "Al Qaeda’s Uncertain Future," Studies in Conflict 26 Terrorism, Volume 36, Issue 8, Taylor 26 Francis)</p><p>The fundamental argument presented in this article, however, advocates a more cautious, <br/>AND<br/>, having, despite all odds, survived for nearly a quarter century.<br/>In this respect, the "Arab Spring," and especially the ongoing unrest and <br/>AND<br/>needed to ensure its continued existence for at least the next five years.<br/>Throughout its history, the oxygen that Al Qaeda depends on has ineluctably been its <br/>AND<br/>complementing its existing outposts in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Yemen, and Somalia.<br/>It must also be noted that the Al Qaeda Core has stubbornly survived despite predictions <br/>AND<br/>, before more expansively declaring that "we’re close to dismantling them."12</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h2 id="HK" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>K</span></h2><p>1) The ballot should simulate the effects of the 1AC —they should only defend the squo or a competitive advocacy based off plan action—key to fairness and relevant decision making</p><p>2) That’s the best way to determine if an approach has value<br/>Donohue 13 Laura K. <strong>Donohue</strong>, Associate Professor of Law, Georgetown Law, 4/11/<strong>13</strong>, National Security Law Pedagogy and the Role of Simulations, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://jnslp.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/National-Security-Law-Pedagogy-and-the-Role-of-Simulations.pdf  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://jnslp.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/National-Security-Law-Pedagogy-and-the-Role-of-Simulations.pdf%27" tppabs="http://jnslp.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/National-Security-Law-Pedagogy-and-the-Role-of-Simulations.pdf"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://jnslp.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/National-Security-Law-Pedagogy-and-the-Role-of-Simulations.pdf</span></a></span></p><p>The concept of simulations as an aspect of higher education, or in the law <br/>AND<br/>full course at Georgetown Law. It has since gone through multiple iterations.<br/>The initial concept followed on the federal full-scale Top Official ("TopOff") exercises, used to train government officials to respond to domestic crises.165 It adapted a Tabletop Exercise, designed with the help of exercise officials at DHS and FEMA, to the law school environment. The Tabletop used one storyline to push on specific legal questions, as students, assigned roles in the discussion, sat around a table and for six hours engaged with the material.<br/>The problem with the Tabletop Exercise was that it was too static, and the <br/>AND<br/>focused on specific legal issues, even as it controlled for external chaos.<br/>The opportunity to provide a more full experience for the students came with the creation of first a one-day, and then a multi-day simulation. The course design and simulation continues to evolve. It offers a model for achieving the pedagogical goals outlined above, in the process developing a rigorous training ground for the next generation of national security lawyers.166<br/>A. Course Design<br/>The central idea in structuring the NSL Sim 2.0 course was to bridge <br/>AND<br/>and legal education) and flexible (responsive to student input and decisionmaking).<br/>Perhaps the most significant weakness in the use of any constructed universe is the problem <br/>AND<br/>student decisions themselves must drive the evolution of events within the simulation.168<br/>Additionally, while authenticity matters, it is worth noting that at some level the <br/>AND<br/>that would be much more difficult to do in a regular practice setting.<br/>NSL Sim 2.0 takes as its starting point the national security pedagogical goals discussed above. It works backwards to then engineer a classroom, cyber, and physical/simulation experience to delve into each of these areas. As a substantive matter, the course focuses on the constitutional, statutory, and regulatory authorities in national security law, placing particular focus on the interstices between black letter law and areas where the field is either unsettled or in flux.<br/>A key aspect of the course design is that it retains both the doctrinal and <br/>AND<br/>giving students the opportunity to develop depth and breadth prior to the exercise.<br/>In order to capture problems related to adaptation and evolution, addressing goal ~1<br/>AND<br/>Law to build the cyber portal used for NSL Sim 2.0.<br/>The twin goals of adaptation and evolution require that students be given a significant amount <br/>AND<br/>execution of the play, further developing their understanding of national security law.<br/>Throughout the simulation, the Control Team is constantly reacting to student choices. When unexpected decisions are made, professors may choose to pursue the evolution of the story to accomplish the pedagogical aims, or they may choose to cut off play in that area (there are various devices for doing so, such as denying requests, sending materials to labs to be analyzed, drawing the players back into the main storylines, and leaking information to the media).<br/>A total immersion simulation involves a number of scenarios, as well as systemic noise<br/>AND<br/>but to embrace them as part of the challenge facing national security lawyers.<br/>The simulation itself is problem-based, giving players agency in driving the evolution <br/>AND<br/>, generating in turn a set of new issues that must be addressed.<br/>The written and oral components of the simulation conform to the fourth pedagogical goal – <br/>AND<br/>simulation – and to deliver a 90 second oral briefing after the session.<br/>To replicate the high-stakes political environment at issue in goals (1) <br/>AND<br/>many different considerations that decisionmakers take into account in the national security domain.<br/>Scenarios are selected with high consequence events in mind, to ensure that students recognize <br/>AND<br/>to emphasize the broader political context within which national security law is practiced.<br/>Both anticipated and unanticipated decisions give rise to ethical questions and matters related to the <br/>AND<br/>exercise itself hitting the aim of the integration of the various pedagogical goals.<br/>Finally, there are multiple layers of feedback that players receive prior to, during<br/>AND<br/>, while another Control Team member may reject a FISC application as insufficient.<br/>The simulation goes beyond this, however, focusing on teaching students how to develop <br/>AND<br/>uncertainty, tension with colleagues, mistakes, and successes in the future.<br/>B. Substantive Areas: Interstices and Threats<br/>As a substantive matter, NSL Sim 2.0 is designed to take account <br/>AND<br/>weapons and pandemic disease also come within the doctrinal part of the course.<br/>The simulation itself is based on five to six storylines reflecting the interstices between different areas of the law. The storylines are used to present a coherent, non-linear scenario that can adapt to student responses. Each scenario is mapped out in a three to seven page document, which is then checked with scientists, government officials, and area experts for consistency with how the scenario would likely unfold in real life.<br/>For the biological weapons and pandemic disease emphasis, for example, one narrative might <br/>AND<br/>through press releases, weather updates, private communications, and the like.<br/>The five to six storylines, prepared by the Control Team in consultation with experts<br/>AND<br/>, giving the Control Team a birds-eye view of the progression.<br/>C. How It Works<br/>As for the nuts and bolts of the simulation itself, it traditionally begins outside of class, in the evening, on the grounds that national security crises often occur at inconvenient times and may well involve limited sleep and competing demands.171 Typically, a phone call from a Control Team member posing in a role integral to one of the main storylines, initiates play.<br/>Students at this point have been assigned dedicated simulation email addresses and provided access to <br/>AND<br/>relevant student teams. The Control Team has access to the complete site.<br/>For the next two (or three) days, outside of student initiatives (<br/>AND<br/>, or technology concerns, while setting the stage for the breaking crisis.<br/>The third (or fourth) day of play takes place entirely at Georgetown Law<br/>AND<br/>releases. Students use their own laptop computers for team decisions and communication.<br/>As the storylines unfold, the Control Team takes on a variety of roles, <br/>AND<br/>the simulation unfolded, and how the students performed in their various capacities.<br/>At the end of the day, the exercise terminates and an immediate hotwash is held, in which players are first debriefed on what occurred during the simulation. Because of the players’ divergent experiences and the different roles assigned to them, the students at this point are often unaware of the complete picture. The judges and formal observers then offer reflections on the simulation and determine which teams performed most effectively.<br/>Over the next few classes, more details about the simulation emerge, as students <br/>AND<br/>opportunities for learning in the future. The course then formally ends.172 <br/>Learning, however, continues beyond the temporal confines of the semester. Students who <br/>AND<br/>concerns.

Johnston is an associate political scientist at the RAND Corporation, a nonprofit, nonpartisan research institution. He is the author of "Does Decapitation Work? Assessing the Effectiveness of Leadership Targeting in Counterinsurgency Campaigns," published in International Security (Spring 2012)., 8/22/2012, "Drone Strikes Keep Pressure on al-Qaida", www.rand.org/blog/2012/08/drone-strikes-keep-pressure-on-al-qaida.html)</p><p>Should the U.S. continue to strike at al-Qaida's leadership with drone attacks? A recent poll shows that while most Americans approve of drone strikes, in 17 out of 20 countries, more than half of those surveyed disapprove of them.<br/>My study of leadership decapitation in 90 counter-insurgencies since the 1970s shows that when militant leaders are captured or killed militant attacks decrease, terrorist campaigns end sooner, and their outcomes tend to favor the government or third-party country, not the militants.<br/>Those opposed to drone strikes often cite the June 2009 one that targeted Pakistani Taliban <br/>AND<br/>cited drone strikes as a key motivation for his May 2010 attempted attack.<br/>Compared to manned aircraft, drones have some advantages as counter-insurgency tools, such as lower costs, longer endurance and the lack of a pilot to place in harm's way and risk of capture. These characteristics can enable a more deliberative targeting process that serves to minimize unintentional casualties. But the weapons employed by drones are usually identical to those used via manned aircraft and can still kill civilians—creating enmity that breeds more terrorists.<br/>Yet many insurgents and terrorists have been taken off the battlefield by U.S. drones and special-operations forces. Besides Mehsud, the list includes Anwar al-Awlaki of al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula; al-Qaida deputy leader Abu Yahya al-Li-bi; and, of course, al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden. Given that list, it is possible that the drone program has prevented numerous attacks by their potential followers, like Shazad.<br/>What does the removal of al-Qaida leadership mean for U.S. national security? Though many in al-Qaida's senior leadership cadre remain, the historical record suggests that "decapitation" will likely weaken the organization and could cripple its ability to conduct major attacks on the U.S. homeland.<br/>Killing terrorist leaders is not necessarily a knockout blow, but can make it harder for terrorists to attack the U.S. Members of al-Qaida's central leadership, once safely amassed in northwestern Pakistan while America shifted its focus to Iraq, have been killed, captured, forced underground or scattered to various locations with little ability to communicate or move securely.<br/>Recently declassified correspondence seized in the bin Laden raid shows that the relentless pressure from the drone campaign on al-Qaida in Pakistan led bin Laden to advise al-Qaida operatives to leave Pakistan's Tribal Areas as no longer safe. Bin Laden's letters show that U.S. counterterrorism actions, which had forced him into self-imposed exile, had made running the organization not only more risky, but also more difficult.<br/>As al-Qaida members trickle out of Pakistan and seek sanctuary elsewhere, the U.S. military is ramping up its counterterrorism operations in Somalia and Yemen, while continuing its drone campaign in Pakistan. Despite its controversial nature, the U.S. counter-terrorism strategy has demonstrated a degree of effectiveness.<br/>The Obama administration is committed to reducing the size of the U.S. military's footprint overseas by relying on drones, special operations forces, and other intelligence capabilities. These methods have made it more difficult for al-Qaida remnants to reconstitute a new safe haven, as Osama bin Laden did in Afghanistan in 1996, after his ouster from Sudan.</p><p>Drones are operationally effective and alternatives are worse—establishing a clear strike policy solves criticism. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>Byman 13 (Daniel Byman, Brookings Institute Saban Center for Middle East Policy, Research Director, and Foreign Policy, Senior Fellow, July/Aug 2013, “Why Drones Work: The Case for the Washington's Weapon of Choice”, www.brookings.edu/research/articles/2013/06/17-drones-obama-weapon-choice-us-counterterrorism-byman)</p><p>Despite President Barack Obama’s recent call to reduce the United States’ reliance on drones, <br/>AND<br/>indiscriminately bomb civilian areas or use scorched-earth tactics against militant groups. <br/> <br/>Risk of nuclear terrorism is real and high now <br/>Bunn 13 (Matthew, Valentin Kuznetsov, Martin B.

uncontrollable conflict escalation<br/>Ryan Goodman, Anne and Joel Ehrenkranz Professor of Law, New York University School of Law, December 2009, CONTROLLING THE RECOURSE TO WAR BY MODIFYING JUS IN BELLO, Yearbook of International Humanitarian Law / Volume 12</p><p>A substantial literature exists on the conflation of jus ad bellum and jus in bello. However, the consequences for the former side of the equation – the resort to war – is generally under-examined. Instead, academic commentary has focused on the effects of compliance with humanitarian rules in armed conflict and, in particular, the equality of application principle. In this section, I attempt to help correct that imbalance.<br/>In the following analysis, I use the (admittedly provocative) short-hand labels of ‘desirable’ and ‘undesirable’ wars. The former consists of efforts that aim to promote the general welfare of foreign populations such as humanitarian interventions and, on some accounts, peacekeeping operations. The latter – undesirable wars – include conflicts that result from security spirals that serve neither state’s interest and also include predatory acts of aggression.<br/>4.1.1 Decreased likelihood of ‘desirable wars’<br/>A central question in debates about humanitarian intervention is whether the international community should be <br/>AND<br/>short, all ‘interventions to protect civilians from wholesale slaughter’ are affected.<br/>Two developments render desirable interventions less likely.

Consider the implications of the <br/>AND<br/>disproportionately affect the very states that take international human rights obligations most seriously.<br/>Notably, in these cases, the disincentives might weigh most heavily on third parties<br/>AND<br/>the international regime should prefer to be involved in these kinds of interventions.<br/>The developments regulating jus ad bellum through jus in bello also threaten to make ‘<br/>AND<br/>result from the pressures created by Type I erosions of the separation principle.<br/>First, increasing the tax on humanitarian interventions (the Kosovo Commission/ICISS approach<br/>AND<br/>language (in resolutions and the like) espousing or emphasizing humanitarian objectives.<br/>Second, the elevation of self-regarding – security and strategic – frameworks over <br/>AND<br/>international disputes exert significant influence on whether conflicts will eventually culminate in war.<br/>Third, a large body of empirical research demonstrates that states will routinely engage in <br/>AND<br/>demands for increased bellicosity, unintended security spirals, and military violence.103<br/>Importantly, these effects may result even if one is skeptical about the power of <br/>AND<br/>states entering into disastrous military campaigns that their leaders did not initially intend.</p><p>Self-defense regime collapse causes global war—US TK legal regime key—only Congress solves international norm development<br/>Beau Barnes, J.D., Boston University School of Law, Spring 2012, REAUTHORIZING THE “WAR ON TERROR”: THE LEGAL AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS OF THE AUMF’S COMING OBSOLESCENCE, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27https://www.jagcnet.army.mil/DOCLIBS/MILITARYLAWREVIEW.NSF/20a66345129fe3d885256e5b00571830/b7396120928e9d5e85257a700042abb5/$FILE/By20Beau20D.20Barnes.pdf  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed using an unsupported protocol (e.g., gopher).  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27https://www.jagcnet.army.mil/DOCLIBS/MILITARYLAWREVIEW.NSF/20a66345129fe3d885256e5b00571830/b7396120928e9d5e85257a700042abb5/$FILE/By20Beau20D.20Barnes.pdf%27" tppabs="https://www.jagcnet.army.mil/DOCLIBS/MILITARYLAWREVIEW.NSF/20a66345129fe3d885256e5b00571830/b7396120928e9d5e85257a700042abb5/$FILE/By20Beau20D.20Barnes.pdf"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">https://www.jagcnet.army.mil/DOCLIBS/MILITARYLAWREVIEW.NSF/20a66345129fe3d885256e5b00571830/b7396120928e9d5e85257a700042abb5/$FILE/By20Beau20D.20Barnes.pdf</span></a></span></p><p>Therefore, the more likely result is that the Executive Branch, grappling with the <br/>AND<br/>prove legally fragile, destabilizing to the international political order, or both.</p><ol><li>Effect on Domestic Law and Policy<br/>Congress’s failure to reauthorize military force would lead to bad domestic law and even worse <br/>AND<br/>be to continue to rely on the September 18, 2001, AUMF.<br/>Second, basing U.S. counterterrorism efforts on the President’s constitutional authority as <br/>AND<br/>would lack stability—confounding cooperation with allies and hindering negotiations with adversaries.<br/>There are, of course, many situations where the president’s position as Commander in <br/>AND<br/>conflict than the public might otherwise be willing to support.”140<br/>In a world without a valid AUMF, the United States could base its continued <br/>AND<br/>problems.”141 Only then can the President’s efforts be sustained and legitimate.<br/>2.

This is known as the principle of proportionality.<br/>“Losing Humanity” argues that technical limitations mean robots could not reliably distinguish civilians <br/>AND<br/>from now are unknown and highly controversial within both expert and lay communities.<br/>While it may not satisfy the reified principle of distinction, proponents of autonomous weapons <br/>AND<br/>to persuade many people that their use in weapons is a net benefit.<br/>Judgment of proportionality seems at first an even greater challenge, and some argue that <br/>AND<br/>this would be to degrade human judgment almost to the level of machines.<br/>On the other hand, IBM’s Watson computer (Ferruci et al., 2010) <br/>AND<br/>decisions that most people would judge as reasonable, most of the time.<br/>“Losing Humanity” also argues that robots, necessarily lacking emotion,2 would be unable to empathize and thus unable to accurately interpret human behavior or be affected by compassion. An important case of the latter is when soldiers refuse orders to put down rebellions. Robots would be ideal tools of repression and dictatorship.<br/>If robot soldiers become available on the world market, it is likely that repressive <br/>AND<br/>hands of dictators, both by restricting their availability and stigmatizing their use.<br/>Accountability is another much-discussed issue. Clearly, a robot cannot be held <br/>AND<br/>since a robot cannot be punished, it cannot be a legal combatant.<br/>These are some of the issues most likely to be discussed within the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons. However, US Defense Department policy (2012) preemptively addresses many of these issues by directing that “autonomous and semi-autonomous weapon systems shall be designed to allow commanders and operators to exercise appropriate levels of human judgment over the use of force.”<br/>Under the US policy, commanders and operators are responsible for using autonomous weapons in <br/>AND<br/>-approves the immediate development, acquisition, and use of such weapons.<br/>Although the policy does not define “appropriate levels,” it applies this rubric even <br/>AND<br/>it to individual states to determine what levels of human judgment are appropriate.<br/>Demanding human control and responsibility<br/>As diplomatic discussions about killer robot regulation get under way, a good deal of time is apt to be lost in confusion about terms, definitions, and scope. “Losing Humanity” seeks to ban “fully autonomous weapons,” and Heyns’s report used the term “lethal autonomous robotics.” The US policy directive speaks of “autonomous and semi-autonomous weapon systems,” and the distinction between these is ambiguous (Gubrud, 2013). The Geneva mandate is to discuss “lethal autonomous weapon systems.”<br/>Substantive questions include whether non-lethal weapons and those that target only matériel are within the scope of discussion. Legacy weapons such as simple mines may be regarded as autonomous, or distinguished as merely automatic, on grounds that their behavior is fully predictable by designers.3 Human-supervised autonomous and semi-autonomous weapon systems, as defined by the United States, raise issues that, like fractal shapes, appear more complex the more closely they are examined.<br/>Instead of arguing about how to define what weapons should be banned, it may <br/>AND<br/>and a human has determined that it is an appropriate and legal target.<br/>A second principle is that a human commander must be responsible and accountable for the decision, and if the commander acts through another person who operates a weapon system, that person must be responsible and accountable for maintaining control of the system. “Responsible” refers here to a moral and legal obligation, and “accountable” refers to a formal system for accounting of actions. Both elements are essential to the approach.<br/>Responsibility implies that commanders and operators may not blame inadequacies of technological systems for any <br/>AND<br/>to prevent unintended engagements, the operator must refuse to operate the system.<br/>Accountability can be demonstrated by states that comply with this principle. They need only maintain records showing that each engagement was properly authorized and executed. If a violation is alleged, selected records can be unsealed in a closed inquiry conducted by an international body (Gubrud and Altmann, 2013).4<br/>This framing, which focuses on human control and responsibility for the decision to use violent force, is both conceptually simple and morally compelling. What remains then is to set standards for adequate information to be presented to commanders, and to require positive action by operators of a weapon system. Those standards should also address any circumstances under which other parties—designers and manufacturers, for instance—might be held responsible for an unintended engagement.<br/>There is at least one exceptional circumstance in which human control may be applied less <br/>AND<br/>be delayed as long as possible to allow time for an override decision.<br/>The strategic need for robot arms control<br/>Principles of humanity may be the strongest foundation for an effective ban of autonomous weapons, but they are not necessarily the most compelling reason why a ban must be sought. The perceived military advantages of autonomy are so great that major powers are likely to strongly resist prohibition, but by the same token, autonomous weapons pose a severe threat to global peace and security.<br/>Although humans have (for now) superior capabilities for perception in complex environments and <br/>AND<br/>expensive, and their replacement by robots is expected to yield cost savings.<br/>While today’s relatively sparse use of drones, in undefended airspace, to target irregular <br/>AND<br/>the use of sea-based drones to attack targets inland as well.<br/>In a cold war, small robots could be used for covert infiltration, surveillance<br/>AND<br/>nuclear-capable and potentially unmanned, which would almost certainly mean autonomous.<br/>There can be no real game-changers in the nuclear stalemate. Yet the <br/>AND<br/>race would be global in scope, as the drone race already is.<br/>Since robots are regarded as expendable, they may be risked in provocative adventures. Recently, China has warned that if Japan makes good on threats to shoot down Chinese drones that approach disputed islands, it could be regarded as an act of war. Similarly, forward-basing of missile interceptors (Lewis and Postol, 2010) or other strategic weapons on unmanned platforms would risk misinterpretation as a signal of imminent attack, and could invite preemption.<br/>Engineering the stability of a robot confrontation would be a wickedly hard problem even for <br/>AND<br/>speed, the potential for events to spiral out of control is obvious.<br/>The way out<br/>Given the military significance of autonomous weapons, substantial pressure from civil society will be needed before the major powers will seriously consider accepting hard limits, let alone prohibition.

It has since gone through multiple iterations.<br/>The initial concept followed on the federal full-scale Top Official (“TopOff”) exercises, used to train government officials to respond to domestic crises.165 It adapted a Tabletop Exercise, designed with the help of exercise officials at DHS and FEMA, to the law school environment. The Tabletop used one storyline to push on specific legal questions, as students, assigned roles in the discussion, sat around a table and for six hours engaged with the material.<br/>The problem with the Tabletop Exercise was that it was too static, and the <br/>AND<br/>focused on specific legal issues, even as it controlled for external chaos.<br/>The opportunity to provide a more full experience for the students came with the creation of first a one-day, and then a multi-day simulation. The course design and simulation continues to evolve. It offers a model for achieving the pedagogical goals outlined above, in the process developing a rigorous training ground for the next generation of national security lawyers.166<br/>A. Course Design<br/>The central idea in structuring the NSL Sim 2.0 course was to bridge <br/>AND<br/>and legal education) and flexible (responsive to student input and decisionmaking).<br/>Perhaps the most significant weakness in the use of any constructed universe is the problem <br/>AND<br/>student decisions themselves must drive the evolution of events within the simulation.168<br/>Additionally, while authenticity matters, it is worth noting that at some level the <br/>AND<br/>that would be much more difficult to do in a regular practice setting.<br/>NSL Sim 2.0 takes as its starting point the national security pedagogical goals discussed above. It works backwards to then engineer a classroom, cyber, and physical/simulation experience to delve into each of these areas. As a substantive matter, the course focuses on the constitutional, statutory, and regulatory authorities in national security law, placing particular focus on the interstices between black letter law and areas where the field is either unsettled or in flux.<br/>A key aspect of the course design is that it retains both the doctrinal and <br/>AND<br/>giving students the opportunity to develop depth and breadth prior to the exercise.<br/>In order to capture problems related to adaptation and evolution, addressing goal 1<br/>AND<br/>Law to build the cyber portal used for NSL Sim 2.0.<br/>The twin goals of adaptation and evolution require that students be given a significant amount <br/>AND<br/>execution of the play, further developing their understanding of national security law.<br/>Throughout the simulation, the Control Team is constantly reacting to student choices. When unexpected decisions are made, professors may choose to pursue the evolution of the story to accomplish the pedagogical aims, or they may choose to cut off play in that area (there are various devices for doing so, such as denying requests, sending materials to labs to be analyzed, drawing the players back into the main storylines, and leaking information to the media).<br/>A total immersion simulation involves a number of scenarios, as well as systemic noise<br/>AND<br/>but to embrace them as part of the challenge facing national security lawyers.<br/>The simulation itself is problem-based, giving players agency in driving the evolution <br/>AND<br/>, generating in turn a set of new issues that must be addressed.<br/>The written and oral components of the simulation conform to the fourth pedagogical goal – <br/>AND<br/>simulation – and to deliver a 90 second oral briefing after the session.<br/>To replicate the high-stakes political environment at issue in goals (1) <br/>AND<br/>many different considerations that decisionmakers take into account in the national security domain.<br/>Scenarios are selected with high consequence events in mind, to ensure that students recognize <br/>AND<br/>to emphasize the broader political context within which national security law is practiced.<br/>Both anticipated and unanticipated decisions give rise to ethical questions and matters related to the <br/>AND<br/>exercise itself hitting the aim of the integration of the various pedagogical goals.<br/>Finally, there are multiple layers of feedback that players receive prior to, during<br/>AND<br/>, while another Control Team member may reject a FISC application as insufficient.<br/>The simulation goes beyond this, however, focusing on teaching students how to develop <br/>AND<br/>uncertainty, tension with colleagues, mistakes, and successes in the future.<br/>B.

The storylines are used to present a coherent, non-linear scenario that can adapt to student responses. Each scenario is mapped out in a three to seven page document, which is then checked with scientists, government officials, and area experts for consistency with how the scenario would likely unfold in real life.<br/>For the biological weapons and pandemic disease emphasis, for example, one narrative might <br/>AND<br/>through press releases, weather updates, private communications, and the like.<br/>The five to six storylines, prepared by the Control Team in consultation with experts<br/>AND<br/>, giving the Control Team a birds-eye view of the progression.<br/>C. How It Works<br/>As for the nuts and bolts of the simulation itself, it traditionally begins outside of class, in the evening, on the grounds that national security crises often occur at inconvenient times and may well involve limited sleep and competing demands.171 Typically, a phone call from a Control Team member posing in a role integral to one of the main storylines, initiates play.<br/>Students at this point have been assigned dedicated simulation email addresses and provided access to <br/>AND<br/>relevant student teams. The Control Team has access to the complete site.<br/>For the next two (or three) days, outside of student initiatives (<br/>AND<br/>, or technology concerns, while setting the stage for the breaking crisis.<br/>The third (or fourth) day of play takes place entirely at Georgetown Law<br/>AND<br/>releases. Students use their own laptop computers for team decisions and communication.<br/>As the storylines unfold, the Control Team takes on a variety of roles, <br/>AND<br/>the simulation unfolded, and how the students performed in their various capacities.<br/>At the end of the day, the exercise terminates and an immediate hotwash is held, in which players are first debriefed on what occurred during the simulation. Because of the players’ divergent experiences and the different roles assigned to them, the students at this point are often unaware of the complete picture.

Typically, they pass by unanimous votes.<br/>But now Aipac, as the group is known, once again finds itself in a very public standoff with the White House. Its top priority, a Senate bill to impose new sanctions on Iran, has stalled after stiff resistance from President Obama, and in what amounts to a tacit retreat, Aipac has stopped pressuring Senate Democrats to vote for the bill.<br/>Officials at the group insist it never called for an immediate vote and say the legislation may yet pass if Mr. Obama’s effort to negotiate a nuclear agreement with Iran fails or if Iran reneges on its interim deal with the West. But for the moment, Mr. Obama has successfully made the case that passing new sanctions against Tehran now could scuttle the nuclear talks and put America on the road to another war.<br/>In doing so, the president has raised questions about the effectiveness of Aipac’s tactics and even its role as the unchallenged voice of the pro-Israel lobby in Washington. Jewish leaders say that pro-Israel groups disagreed on how aggressively to push the legislation, even if all the groups favor additional sanctions.<br/>“Some of us see the object as being to target Iran,” said Abraham H. Foxman, the national director of the Anti-Defamation League. “We’re not out there to target the president; we’re out there to target Iran.”<br/>With neither side spoiling for a fight or ready to back down, Mr. Foxman said, the sanctions campaign is stalled. Lawmakers confirm that the political climate on Capitol Hill has changed since the bill’s sponsors and Aipac made their push in December.<br/>Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, a staunch supporter of Israel, is one of 16 Democrats who signed on to the bill, along with 43 of the Senate’s 45 Republicans, bringing it to within a few votes of a veto-proof majority. Now Mr. Blumenthal says the Senate should hold off on a vote to give Mr. Obama breathing room for diplomacy.<br/>“There’s been an unquestionable, undeniable shift in the perception of national security,” Mr. Blumenthal said. “I’m sensitive to the feelings, the resistance, the aversion of the general public to any kind of American military engagement.”<br/>On Monday, 70 House Democrats sent Mr. Obama a letter backing his diplomatic efforts and opposing new sanctions.

But in light of the unresolved issues that must be addressed, it would be unwise to bet that events will unfold as planned. Unrealistic expectations about the Iran deal need to be revised downward.<br/>In Geneva on November 24, Iran and the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council—China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States—plus Germany agreed to a Joint Plan of Action. For good reason, the world welcomed this initial agreement because it squarely put Iran and the powers on a road to end the crisis through diplomacy.<br/>The deal calls for Tehran and the powers to negotiate the “final step” <br/>AND<br/>period of time.

If differences result in a stalemate, Iran’s hardliners could gain the upper hand, continue pursuing unfettered nuclear development, and eventually terminate the initial accord. Alternatively, U.S. lawmakers could respond to a lack of progress by adding to Iran’s sanctions burden, which would likewise doom the negotiation.

President Obama has staked the success of his foreign policy on this bold gamble. But discussion about the nuclear deal has diverted attention from an even riskier bet that Obama has placed: the idea that Iran can become a cooperative partner in regional security.<br/>Although they won’t say so publicly, Mr. Obama and Secretary of State John <br/>AND<br/>when the “Concert of Europe” worked together to stabilize that Continent.<br/>As a first step, Mr. Kerry has made no secret of his desire to involve Iran in Syrian peace talks, scheduled to convene next week in Geneva. And much more than previous administrations, this one has refrained from countering Iranian machinations in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon.<br/>There are two main reasons for this attempted shift. One is simply the desire of the president to extricate the United States from the Middle East. The other reason, arguably more important, is fear of Al Qaeda: The White House undoubtedly sees Iran and its Shiite allies as potential partners in the fight against Sunni jihadism.<br/>The Obama strategy is breathtakingly ambitious. It is also destined to fail.<br/>First, it ignores the obvious fact that, unlike China at the time of <br/>AND<br/>threat to justify an alliance with the “capitalist imperialists” in Washington.<br/>The second major problem is that Iran has always harbored dreams of regional hegemony. There is no sign that the election of the “moderate” cleric Hassan Rouhani as president has changed anything.<br/>On the contrary, Iran is stepping up its support for militants in the region. There have been reports recently that Iran is smuggling sophisticated long-range missiles to Hezbollah via Syria and that it sent a ship, intercepted by the Bahraini authorities, loaded with armaments intended for Shiite opponents of the Sunni government in Bahrain.<br/>Iran under President Rouhani has done nothing to lessen its support for the regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria either. It has, in fact, gone “all in,” sending large numbers of its own operatives and its Hezbollah allies, along with copious munitions, to help the regime stay in power.<br/>Iran’s power play is engendering a violent pushback from Sunnis increasingly radicalized in the process. This is the third and final problem that will doom Obama’s outreach to Tehran.<br/>In Iraq, the Shiite prime minister, Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, who is surrounded by aides with ties to the Iranians, has been arresting prominent Sunnis in Anbar Province, thereby driving many of the tribal fighters who once fought Al Qaeda in Iraq back into an alliance with the terrorist group. Al Qaeda-linked fighters have now taken control of Falluja, a town that American forces secured in 2004 after a costly campaign.<br/>Jihadist influence now extends from western Iraq into neighboring Syria, where Sunnis are reacting just as violently to the Iranian-orchestrated offensive to keep Assad’s Alawite regime in power. With the United States providing little or no support to moderate opposition elements, extremist groups such as the Nusra Front and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (an offshoot of Al Qaeda in Iraq) are increasingly prominent among the rebel forces.<br/>The spillover from Syria is also affecting Lebanon, where Hezbollah has long been the <br/>AND<br/>, Rafik Hariri, was also killed by a car bomb in 2005.<br/>This shows what happens when the United States stands aloof and refuses to do more to counter Iranian power: America’s allies in the region take matters into their own hands. The result is the polarization of the entire region into pro- and anti-Iran blocs that feed a mushrooming cross-border civil war.<br/>The situation will only get worse if Iran is allowed to maintain its nuclear program with international blessing. Saudi Arabia has made clear that it is prepared to build its own bomb, while Israel has threatened to launch a unilateral strike on Iranian nuclear facilities.<br/>Mr. Obama’s hopes of using an opening to Iran to stabilize the Middle East will almost certainly backfire. Before long, America is likely to be forced back into its traditional, post-1979 role as the leader of a coalition to counter Iranian designs. The place to begin is in Syria, which is now ground zero in the struggle between the two regional blocs.<br/>Expansive self-defense regime enables Israel strike on Iran --- escalates and causes World War 3<br/>Slager 12 (Katherine, J.D.

Analysis<br/>Under a restrictive interpretation of the U.N. Charter, Israel would not <br/>AND<br/>whether an Israeli preemptive strike would be acceptable under modern international law. n360</li><li>Customary International Law<br/>The Caroline doctrine, which underlies the customary international law analysis of anticipatory self-<br/>AND<br/>nuclear attack would meet the "necessity" requirement of the Caroline doctrine.<br/>Proportionality requires that action should not exceed what is minimally necessary to respond to a threat. n365 It would be in Israel's diplomatic interests to respond with only the minimum required to avert the threat of nuclear attack. A preemptive strike that neutralizes Iran's nuclear program and does not exceed the immediate threat to Israel to pursue "broader offensive or strategic goals" would satisfy the requirement of proportionality. n366<br/>With the assumption that an Israeli preemptive strike would meet both the necessity and proportionality <br/>AND<br/>and the 1981 Israeli attack on Osirak, which was uniformly condemned. n368<br/>As discussed in Part III.B, several threats were present in the &nbsp;*<br/>AND<br/>that seem to meet the "imminence" requirement of customary international law.<br/>Israel, taken in the light most favorable to an argument for legitimacy, may <br/>AND<br/>appear to be any further corroborations of an intention to attack Israel. n371<br/>Developing nuclear weapons, because of their first-strike capabilities, may be tantamount <br/>AND<br/>only moderately resembles the threat posed by Egypt preceding the Six Day War.<br/>The present situation between Israel and Iran more closely resembles Israel's attack on the Osirak <br/>AND<br/>an even stronger argument for an "imminent attack" by Iran today.<br/>The presence of these factors, without more, does not rise to the "<br/>AND<br/>weapons - should they come into Iran's possession - against the Israeli state.<br/>While Israel may have a stronger argument for imminence today than it did in 1981, the present situation bears much stronger resemblance to the 1981 Osirak incident, where imminence was clearly not found, than to the 1967 Six Day War. As the Iranian threat against Israel does not rise to the imminence required by the Caroline doctrine, an Israeli preemptive strike against Iran would not be legal under customary international law.<br/>&nbsp;*319 <br/>2. Sadoff's Framework<br/>The analytical framework proposed by David Sadoff offers an analysis of anticipatory self-defense <br/>AND<br/>be sufficiently imminent to justify an act of anticipatory self-defense. n378<br/>First, assessing the nature and scale of an Iranian nuclear attack is fairly straightforward. Israel fears facing the threat of "first strike" nuclear attack, which would leave little or no time for Israel to respond defensively once launched. n379 Israel would likely receive little to no warning of a nuclear launch. Such an attack could decimate the entirety of the Israeli state. The nature and scale of the threat is likely the gravest threat imaginable.<br/>The "likelihood" of the attack, however, is much more ambiguous. <br/>AND<br/>any intention to attack and does not presently have the capacity to attack.<br/>The third factor in gauging the threat, timing, is interspersed with the likelihood factor. Sadoff suggests similar questions for the assessment of these two components. n387 This seems appropriate. If an attack is not very likely to occur, then it is moot to consider whether the timing of an attack is sufficiently immediate to justify a pre-emptive strike.<br/>3. Considerations<br/>Under the analyses of both the customary international law and Sadoff's frameworks, an Israeli <br/>AND<br/>Sadoff framework, using preemptive force to deter an attack would be justified.<br/>Also significant to the Caroline doctrine's approach is that there are more options available to <br/>AND<br/>-defense where there is no actual imminence of a threatened attack. n394<br/>&nbsp;*322 &nbsp;Second, the rules that govern use of force must be <br/>AND<br/>that should bind, these laws lose their normative and prescriptive value. n395<br/>Expansive overhaul of the modern international legal order is not the solution.

uncontrollable conflict escalation<br/>Ryan Goodman, Anne and Joel Ehrenkranz Professor of Law, New York University School of Law, December 2009, CONTROLLING THE RECOURSE TO WAR BY MODIFYING JUS IN BELLO, Yearbook of International Humanitarian Law / Volume 12</p><p>A substantial literature exists on the conflation of jus ad bellum and jus in bello. However, the consequences for the former side of the equation – the resort to war – is generally under-examined. Instead, academic commentary has focused on the effects of compliance with humanitarian rules in armed conflict and, in particular, the equality of application principle. In this section, I attempt to help correct that imbalance.<br/>In the following analysis, I use the (admittedly provocative) short-hand labels of ‘desirable’ and ‘undesirable’ wars. The former consists of efforts that aim to promote the general welfare of foreign populations such as humanitarian interventions and, on some accounts, peacekeeping operations. The latter – undesirable wars – include conflicts that result from security spirals that serve neither state’s interest and also include predatory acts of aggression.<br/>4.1.1 Decreased likelihood of ‘desirable wars’<br/>A central question in debates about humanitarian intervention is whether the international community should be <br/>AND<br/>short, all ‘interventions to protect civilians from wholesale slaughter’ are affected.<br/>Two developments render desirable interventions less likely. First, consider implications of the Kosovo <br/>AND<br/>one would most want to incentivize to initiate and participate in humanitarian interventions.<br/>The second development shares many of these same consequences. Consider the implications of the <br/>AND<br/>disproportionately affect the very states that take international human rights obligations most seriously.<br/>Notably, in these cases, the disincentives might weigh most heavily on third parties<br/>AND<br/>the international regime should prefer to be involved in these kinds of interventions.<br/>The developments regulating jus ad bellum through jus in bello also threaten to make ‘<br/>AND<br/>result from the pressures created by Type I erosions of the separation principle.<br/>First, increasing the tax on humanitarian interventions (the Kosovo Commission/ICISS approach<br/>AND<br/>language (in resolutions and the like) espousing or emphasizing humanitarian objectives.<br/>Second, the elevation of self-regarding – security and strategic – frameworks over <br/>AND<br/>international disputes exert significant influence on whether conflicts will eventually culminate in war.<br/>Third, a large body of empirical research demonstrates that states will routinely engage in <br/>AND<br/>demands for increased bellicosity, unintended security spirals, and military violence.103<br/>Importantly, these effects may result even if one is skeptical about the power of <br/>AND<br/>states entering into disastrous military campaigns that their leaders did not initially intend.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>A strong, adaptive LOAC regime is key to regulate inevitable autonomous weapons – the impact is global war and tyranny<br/>Mark Gubrud 14, prof at UNC-Chapel Hill, was a research fellow at Princeton specializing in arms control, Stopping killer robots, Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists January/February 2014 vol. 70 no.1 32-42<br/> <br/>Since the first lethal drone strike in 2001, the US use of remotely operated <br/>AND<br/>is now the most dynamic and destabilizing component of the global arms race.<br/>Drones and robots are enabled by embedded autonomous subsystems that keep engines in tune and antennas pointed at satellites, and some can navigate, walk, and maneuver in complex environments autonomously. But with few exceptions, the targeting and firing decisions of armed robotic systems remain tightly under the control of human operators. This may soon change.<br/>Autonomous weapons are robotic systems that, once activated, can select and engage targets <br/>AND<br/>attack on an adversary’s strategic forces. Autonomous weapons may fight each other.<br/>Just as the emergence of low-cost, high-performance information technology has been the most important driver of technological advance over the past half-century—including the revolution in military affairs already seen in the 1980s and displayed to the world during the 1991 Gulf War—so the emergence of artificial intelligence and autonomous robotics will likely be the most important development in both civilian and military technology to unfold over the next few decades.<br/>Proponents of autonomous weapons argue that technology will gradually take over combat decision making: <br/>AND<br/>fast, and the factors involved are too complex for real human comprehension.”<br/>Almost nobody favors a future in which humans have lost control over war machines. <br/>AND<br/>would cheat on agreements. This is the ideology of any arms race.<br/>Is autonomous warfare inevitable?<br/>Challenging the assumption of the inevitability of autonomous weapons and building on the work of <br/>AND<br/>The issue has been placed firmly on the global public and diplomatic agenda.<br/>Despite this impressive record of progress on an issue that was until recently virtually unknown<br/>AND<br/>, unrealized horror, one that some might hope will simply go away.<br/>Unless there is a strong push from civil society and from governments that have decided <br/>AND<br/>assumption that autonomous weapons will be programmed by humans is ultimately in doubt.<br/>Diplomats and public spokesmen may speak in one voice; warriors, engineers, and <br/>AND<br/>global arms race toward robotic arsenals that are increasingly out of human control.<br/>Humanitarian law vs. killer robots<br/>The public discussion launched by the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots has mostly centered on <br/>AND<br/>Rights Watch and International Human Rights Clinic at Harvard Law School, 2012).<br/>The principle of distinction, as enshrined in Additional Protocol I of the Geneva Conventions<br/>AND<br/>expected from the attack. This is known as the principle of proportionality.<br/>“Losing Humanity” argues that technical limitations mean robots could not reliably distinguish civilians <br/>AND<br/>from now are unknown and highly controversial within both expert and lay communities.<br/>While it may not satisfy the reified principle of distinction, proponents of autonomous weapons <br/>AND<br/>to persuade many people that their use in weapons is a net benefit.<br/>Judgment of proportionality seems at first an even greater challenge, and some argue that <br/>AND<br/>this would be to degrade human judgment almost to the level of machines.<br/>On the other hand, IBM’s Watson computer (Ferruci et al., 2010) <br/>AND<br/>decisions that most people would judge as reasonable, most of the time.<br/>“Losing Humanity” also argues that robots, necessarily lacking emotion,2 would be unable to empathize and thus unable to accurately interpret human behavior or be affected by compassion. An important case of the latter is when soldiers refuse orders to put down rebellions. Robots would be ideal tools of repression and dictatorship.<br/>If robot soldiers become available on the world market, it is likely that repressive <br/>AND<br/>hands of dictators, both by restricting their availability and stigmatizing their use.<br/>Accountability is another much-discussed issue. Clearly, a robot cannot be held <br/>AND<br/>since a robot cannot be punished, it cannot be a legal combatant.<br/>These are some of the issues most likely to be discussed within the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons. However, US Defense Department policy (2012) preemptively addresses many of these issues by directing that “autonomous and semi-autonomous weapon systems shall be designed to allow commanders and operators to exercise appropriate levels of human judgment over the use of force.”<br/>Under the US policy, commanders and operators are responsible for using autonomous weapons in <br/>AND<br/>-approves the immediate development, acquisition, and use of such weapons.<br/>Although the policy does not define “appropriate levels,” it applies this rubric even <br/>AND<br/>it to individual states to determine what levels of human judgment are appropriate.<br/>Demanding human control and responsibility<br/>As diplomatic discussions about killer robot regulation get under way, a good deal of time is apt to be lost in confusion about terms, definitions, and scope. “Losing Humanity” seeks to ban “fully autonomous weapons,” and Heyns’s report used the term “lethal autonomous robotics.” The US policy directive speaks of “autonomous and semi-autonomous weapon systems,” and the distinction between these is ambiguous (Gubrud, 2013). The Geneva mandate is to discuss “lethal autonomous weapon systems.”<br/>Substantive questions include whether non-lethal weapons and those that target only matériel are within the scope of discussion. Legacy weapons such as simple mines may be regarded as autonomous, or distinguished as merely automatic, on grounds that their behavior is fully predictable by designers.3 Human-supervised autonomous and semi-autonomous weapon systems, as defined by the United States, raise issues that, like fractal shapes, appear more complex the more closely they are examined.<br/>Instead of arguing about how to define what weapons should be banned, it may <br/>AND<br/>and a human has determined that it is an appropriate and legal target.<br/>A second principle is that a human commander must be responsible and accountable for the decision, and if the commander acts through another person who operates a weapon system, that person must be responsible and accountable for maintaining control of the system. “Responsible” refers here to a moral and legal obligation, and “accountable” refers to a formal system for accounting of actions. Both elements are essential to the approach.<br/>Responsibility implies that commanders and operators may not blame inadequacies of technological systems for any <br/>AND<br/>to prevent unintended engagements, the operator must refuse to operate the system.<br/>Accountability can be demonstrated by states that comply with this principle. They need only maintain records showing that each engagement was properly authorized and executed. If a violation is alleged, selected records can be unsealed in a closed inquiry conducted by an international body (Gubrud and Altmann, 2013).4<br/>This framing, which focuses on human control and responsibility for the decision to use violent force, is both conceptually simple and morally compelling. What remains then is to set standards for adequate information to be presented to commanders, and to require positive action by operators of a weapon system. Those standards should also address any circumstances under which other parties—designers and manufacturers, for instance—might be held responsible for an unintended engagement.<br/>There is at least one exceptional circumstance in which human control may be applied less <br/>AND<br/>be delayed as long as possible to allow time for an override decision.<br/>The strategic need for robot arms control<br/>Principles of humanity may be the strongest foundation for an effective ban of autonomous weapons, but they are not necessarily the most compelling reason why a ban must be sought. The perceived military advantages of autonomy are so great that major powers are likely to strongly resist prohibition, but by the same token, autonomous weapons pose a severe threat to global peace and security.<br/>Although humans have (for now) superior capabilities for perception in complex environments and <br/>AND<br/>expensive, and their replacement by robots is expected to yield cost savings.<br/>While today’s relatively sparse use of drones, in undefended airspace, to target irregular <br/>AND<br/>the use of sea-based drones to attack targets inland as well.<br/>In a cold war, small robots could be used for covert infiltration, surveillance<br/>AND<br/>nuclear-capable and potentially unmanned, which would almost certainly mean autonomous.<br/>There can be no real game-changers in the nuclear stalemate. Yet the <br/>AND<br/>race would be global in scope, as the drone race already is.<br/>Since robots are regarded as expendable, they may be risked in provocative adventures. Recently, China has warned that if Japan makes good on threats to shoot down Chinese drones that approach disputed islands, it could be regarded as an act of war.

It has since gone through multiple iterations.<br/>The initial concept followed on the federal full-scale Top Official (“TopOff”) exercises, used to train government officials to respond to domestic crises.165 It adapted a Tabletop Exercise, designed with the help of exercise officials at DHS and FEMA, to the law school environment. The Tabletop used one storyline to push on specific legal questions, as students, assigned roles in the discussion, sat around a table and for six hours engaged with the material.<br/>The problem with the Tabletop Exercise was that it was too static, and the <br/>AND<br/>focused on specific legal issues, even as it controlled for external chaos.<br/>The opportunity to provide a more full experience for the students came with the creation of first a one-day, and then a multi-day simulation. The course design and simulation continues to evolve. It offers a model for achieving the pedagogical goals outlined above, in the process developing a rigorous training ground for the next generation of national security lawyers.166<br/>A. Course Design<br/>The central idea in structuring the NSL Sim 2.0 course was to bridge <br/>AND<br/>and legal education) and flexible (responsive to student input and decisionmaking).<br/>Perhaps the most significant weakness in the use of any constructed universe is the problem <br/>AND<br/>student decisions themselves must drive the evolution of events within the simulation.168<br/>Additionally, while authenticity matters, it is worth noting that at some level the <br/>AND<br/>that would be much more difficult to do in a regular practice setting.<br/>NSL Sim 2.0 takes as its starting point the national security pedagogical goals discussed above. It works backwards to then engineer a classroom, cyber, and physical/simulation experience to delve into each of these areas. As a substantive matter, the course focuses on the constitutional, statutory, and regulatory authorities in national security law, placing particular focus on the interstices between black letter law and areas where the field is either unsettled or in flux.<br/>A key aspect of the course design is that it retains both the doctrinal and <br/>AND<br/>giving students the opportunity to develop depth and breadth prior to the exercise.<br/>In order to capture problems related to adaptation and evolution, addressing goal 1<br/>AND<br/>Law to build the cyber portal used for NSL Sim 2.0.<br/>The twin goals of adaptation and evolution require that students be given a significant amount <br/>AND<br/>execution of the play, further developing their understanding of national security law.<br/>Throughout the simulation, the Control Team is constantly reacting to student choices. When unexpected decisions are made, professors may choose to pursue the evolution of the story to accomplish the pedagogical aims, or they may choose to cut off play in that area (there are various devices for doing so, such as denying requests, sending materials to labs to be analyzed, drawing the players back into the main storylines, and leaking information to the media).<br/>A total immersion simulation involves a number of scenarios, as well as systemic noise<br/>AND<br/>but to embrace them as part of the challenge facing national security lawyers.<br/>The simulation itself is problem-based, giving players agency in driving the evolution <br/>AND<br/>, generating in turn a set of new issues that must be addressed.<br/>The written and oral components of the simulation conform to the fourth pedagogical goal – <br/>AND<br/>simulation – and to deliver a 90 second oral briefing after the session.<br/>To replicate the high-stakes political environment at issue in goals (1) <br/>AND<br/>many different considerations that decisionmakers take into account in the national security domain.<br/>Scenarios are selected with high consequence events in mind, to ensure that students recognize <br/>AND<br/>to emphasize the broader political context within which national security law is practiced.<br/>Both anticipated and unanticipated decisions give rise to ethical questions and matters related to the <br/>AND<br/>exercise itself hitting the aim of the integration of the various pedagogical goals.<br/>Finally, there are multiple layers of feedback that players receive prior to, during<br/>AND<br/>, while another Control Team member may reject a FISC application as insufficient.<br/>The simulation goes beyond this, however, focusing on teaching students how to develop <br/>AND<br/>uncertainty, tension with colleagues, mistakes, and successes in the future.<br/>B. Substantive Areas: Interstices and Threats<br/>As a substantive matter, NSL Sim 2.0 is designed to take account <br/>AND<br/>weapons and pandemic disease also come within the doctrinal part of the course.<br/>The simulation itself is based on five to six storylines reflecting the interstices between different areas of the law. The storylines are used to present a coherent, non-linear scenario that can adapt to student responses. Each scenario is mapped out in a three to seven page document, which is then checked with scientists, government officials, and area experts for consistency with how the scenario would likely unfold in real life.<br/>For the biological weapons and pandemic disease emphasis, for example, one narrative might <br/>AND<br/>through press releases, weather updates, private communications, and the like.<br/>The five to six storylines, prepared by the Control Team in consultation with experts<br/>AND<br/>, giving the Control Team a birds-eye view of the progression.<br/>C. How It Works<br/>As for the nuts and bolts of the simulation itself, it traditionally begins outside of class, in the evening, on the grounds that national security crises often occur at inconvenient times and may well involve limited sleep and competing demands.171 Typically, a phone call from a Control Team member posing in a role integral to one of the main storylines, initiates play.<br/>Students at this point have been assigned dedicated simulation email addresses and provided access to <br/>AND<br/>relevant student teams. The Control Team has access to the complete site.<br/>For the next two (or three) days, outside of student initiatives (<br/>AND<br/>, or technology concerns, while setting the stage for the breaking crisis.<br/>The third (or fourth) day of play takes place entirely at Georgetown Law<br/>AND<br/>releases. Students use their own laptop computers for team decisions and communication.<br/>As the storylines unfold, the Control Team takes on a variety of roles, <br/>AND<br/>the simulation unfolded, and how the students performed in their various capacities.<br/>At the end of the day, the exercise terminates and an immediate hotwash is held, in which players are first debriefed on what occurred during the simulation. Because of the players’ divergent experiences and the different roles assigned to them, the students at this point are often unaware of the complete picture. The judges and formal observers then offer reflections on the simulation and determine which teams performed most effectively.<br/>Over the next few classes, more details about the simulation emerge, as students <br/>AND<br/>opportunities for learning in the future. The course then formally ends.172 <br/>Learning, however, continues beyond the temporal confines of the semester. Students who <br/>AND<br/>concerns. And it builds a strong community of individuals with common interests.<br/>CONCLUSION<br/>The legal academy has, of late, been swept up in concern about the <br/>AND<br/>both the expression of government authority and the effort to limit the same.<br/>The one-size fits all approach currently dominating the conversation in legal education, <br/>AND<br/>greater nuance in the discussion of the adequacy of the current pedagogical approach.<br/>With this approach in mind, I have here suggested six pedagogical goals for national <br/>AND<br/>to ensure that they will be most effective when they enter the field.<br/>The problem with the current structures in legal education is that they fall short, <br/>AND<br/>in other areas of experiential education, such as clinics and moot court.<br/>It is in an effort to address these concerns that I developed the simulation model <br/>AND<br/>undoubtedly necessary, it suggests one potential direction for the years to come.</p><p>Pragmatic potential is a controlling factor for evaluating simulations<br/>Shelby 7 – Tommie Shelby, Professor of African and African American Studies and of Philosophy at Harvard, 2007, We Who Are Dark: The Philosophical Foundations of Black Solidarity</p><p>But African American philosophy does not typically make public policy recommendations.

If it serves to encourage the study of <br/>AND<br/>or worse, a fundamental level of organization and fundamental locus of power.<br/>The normative critique of the nation-state comes from two directions. From above, the cosmopolitan argument is that humanity as a whole, not the nation- state, should define the primary horizon of our moral imagination and political engagement (Nussbaum, 1996). From below, muticulturalism and identity politics celebrate group identities and privilege them over wider, more encompassing affiliations.<br/>One can distinguish stronger and weaker versions of the cosmopolitan argument.

Johnston is an associate political scientist at the RAND Corporation, a nonprofit, nonpartisan research institution. He is the author of "Does Decapitation Work? Assessing the Effectiveness of Leadership Targeting in Counterinsurgency Campaigns," published in International Security (Spring 2012)., 8/22/2012, "Drone Strikes Keep Pressure on al-Qaida", www.rand.org/blog/2012/08/drone-strikes-keep-pressure-on-al-qaida.html)</p><p>Should the U.S. continue to strike at al-Qaida's leadership with drone attacks? A recent poll shows that while most Americans approve of drone strikes, in 17 out of 20 countries, more than half of those surveyed disapprove of them.<br/>My study of leadership decapitation in 90 counter-insurgencies since the 1970s shows that when militant leaders are captured or killed militant attacks decrease, terrorist campaigns end sooner, and their outcomes tend to favor the government or third-party country, not the militants.<br/>Those opposed to drone strikes often cite the June 2009 one that targeted Pakistani Taliban <br/>AND<br/>cited drone strikes as a key motivation for his May 2010 attempted attack.<br/>Compared to manned aircraft, drones have some advantages as counter-insurgency tools, such as lower costs, longer endurance and the lack of a pilot to place in harm's way and risk of capture. These characteristics can enable a more deliberative targeting process that serves to minimize unintentional casualties. But the weapons employed by drones are usually identical to those used via manned aircraft and can still kill civilians—creating enmity that breeds more terrorists.<br/>Yet many insurgents and terrorists have been taken off the battlefield by U.S. drones and special-operations forces. Besides Mehsud, the list includes Anwar al-Awlaki of al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula; al-Qaida deputy leader Abu Yahya al-Li-bi; and, of course, al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden. Given that list, it is possible that the drone program has prevented numerous attacks by their potential followers, like Shazad.<br/>What does the removal of al-Qaida leadership mean for U.S. national security? Though many in al-Qaida's senior leadership cadre remain, the historical record suggests that "decapitation" will likely weaken the organization and could cripple its ability to conduct major attacks on the U.S. homeland.<br/>Killing terrorist leaders is not necessarily a knockout blow, but can make it harder for terrorists to attack the U.S. Members of al-Qaida's central leadership, once safely amassed in northwestern Pakistan while America shifted its focus to Iraq, have been killed, captured, forced underground or scattered to various locations with little ability to communicate or move securely.<br/>Recently declassified correspondence seized in the bin Laden raid shows that the relentless pressure from the drone campaign on al-Qaida in Pakistan led bin Laden to advise al-Qaida operatives to leave Pakistan's Tribal Areas as no longer safe. Bin Laden's letters show that U.S. counterterrorism actions, which had forced him into self-imposed exile, had made running the organization not only more risky, but also more difficult.<br/>As al-Qaida members trickle out of Pakistan and seek sanctuary elsewhere, the U.S. military is ramping up its counterterrorism operations in Somalia and Yemen, while continuing its drone campaign in Pakistan. Despite its controversial nature, the U.S. counter-terrorism strategy has demonstrated a degree of effectiveness.<br/>The Obama administration is committed to reducing the size of the U.S. military's footprint overseas by relying on drones, special operations forces, and other intelligence capabilities. These methods have made it more difficult for al-Qaida remnants to reconstitute a new safe haven, as Osama bin Laden did in Afghanistan in 1996, after his ouster from Sudan.</p><p>Drones are operationally effective and alternatives are worse—establishing a clear strike policy solves criticism. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>Byman 13 (Daniel Byman, Brookings Institute Saban Center for Middle East Policy, Research Director, and Foreign Policy, Senior Fellow, July/Aug 2013, “Why Drones Work: The Case for the Washington's Weapon of Choice”, www.brookings.edu/research/articles/2013/06/17-drones-obama-weapon-choice-us-counterterrorism-byman)</p><p>Despite President Barack Obama’s recent call to reduce the United States’ reliance on drones, <br/>AND<br/>indiscriminately bomb civilian areas or use scorched-earth tactics against militant groups. <br/> <br/>Risk of nuclear terrorism is real and high now <br/>Bunn 13 (Matthew, Valentin Kuznetsov, Martin B.

BELLO, Yearbook of International Humanitarian Law / Volume 12</p><p>A substantial literature exists on the conflation of jus ad bellum and jus in bello. However, the consequences for the former side of the equation – the resort to war – is generally under-examined. Instead, academic commentary has focused on the effects of compliance with humanitarian rules in armed conflict and, in particular, the equality of application principle. In this section, I attempt to help correct that imbalance.<br/>In the following analysis, I use the (admittedly provocative) short-hand labels of ‘desirable’ and ‘undesirable’ wars. The former consists of efforts that aim to promote the general welfare of foreign populations such as humanitarian interventions and, on some accounts, peacekeeping operations. The latter – undesirable wars – include conflicts that result from security spirals that serve neither state’s interest and also include predatory acts of aggression.<br/>4.1.1 Decreased likelihood of ‘desirable wars’<br/>A central question in debates about humanitarian intervention is whether the international community should be <br/>AND<br/>short, all ‘interventions to protect civilians from wholesale slaughter’ are affected.<br/>Two developments render desirable interventions less likely.

In fact, a ban is unnecessary and dangerous.<br/>No country has publicly revealed plans to use fully autonomous weapons, including drone-<br/>AND<br/>-defense system similarly responds to threats faster than human reaction times permit.<br/>Contrary to what some critics of autonomous weapons claim, there won't be an abrupt <br/>AND<br/>from full command, to partial command, to oversight and so on.<br/>This evolution is inevitable as sensors, computer analytics and machine learning improve; as states demand greater protection for their military personnel; and as similar technologies in civilian life prove that they are capable of complex tasks, such as driving cars or performing surgery, with greater safety than human operators.<br/>But critics like the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots believe that governments must stop this <br/>AND<br/>, they believe that these systems may operate in unpredictable, ruthless ways.<br/>Yet a ban is unlikely to work, especially in constraining states or actors most inclined to abuse these weapons. Those actors will not respect such an agreement, and the technological elements of highly automated weapons will proliferate.<br/>Moreover, because the automation of weapons will happen gradually, it would be nearly impossible to design or enforce such a ban. Because the same system might be operable with or without effective human control or oversight, the line between legal weapons and illegal autonomous ones will not be clear-cut.<br/>If the goal is to reduce suffering and protect human lives, a ban could <br/>AND<br/>rules. Autonomous weapons systems have the potential to address these human shortcomings.<br/>No one can say with certainty how much automated capabilities might gradually reduce the harm of warfare, but it would be wrong not to pursue such gains, and it would be especially pernicious to ban research into such technologies.<br/>That said, autonomous weapons warrant careful regulation. Each step toward automation needs to <br/>AND<br/>for how these systems are to be used and in what combat environments.<br/>If the past decade of the U.S. drone program has taught us <br/>AND<br/>strategic imperative to demonstrate new weapons' adherence to high legal and ethical standards.<br/>This approach will not work if the U.S. goes it alone. America should gather a coalition of like-minded partners to adapt existing international legal standards and develop best practices for applying them to autonomous weapons. The British government, for example, has declared its opposition to a treaty ban on autonomous weapons but is urging responsible states to develop common standards for the weapons' use within the laws of war.<br/>Autonomous weapons are not inherently unlawful or unethical.

It has since gone through multiple iterations.<br/>The initial concept followed on the federal full-scale Top Official (“TopOff”) exercises, used to train government officials to respond to domestic crises.165 It adapted a Tabletop Exercise, designed with the help of exercise officials at DHS and FEMA, to the law school environment. The Tabletop used one storyline to push on specific legal questions, as students, assigned roles in the discussion, sat around a table and for six hours engaged with the material.<br/>The problem with the Tabletop Exercise was that it was too static, and the <br/>AND<br/>focused on specific legal issues, even as it controlled for external chaos.<br/>The opportunity to provide a more full experience for the students came with the creation of first a one-day, and then a multi-day simulation. The course design and simulation continues to evolve. It offers a model for achieving the pedagogical goals outlined above, in the process developing a rigorous training ground for the next generation of national security lawyers.166<br/>A. Course Design<br/>The central idea in structuring the NSL Sim 2.0 course was to bridge <br/>AND<br/>and legal education) and flexible (responsive to student input and decisionmaking).<br/>Perhaps the most significant weakness in the use of any constructed universe is the problem <br/>AND<br/>student decisions themselves must drive the evolution of events within the simulation.168<br/>Additionally, while authenticity matters, it is worth noting that at some level the <br/>AND<br/>that would be much more difficult to do in a regular practice setting.<br/>NSL Sim 2.0 takes as its starting point the national security pedagogical goals discussed above. It works backwards to then engineer a classroom, cyber, and physical/simulation experience to delve into each of these areas. As a substantive matter, the course focuses on the constitutional, statutory, and regulatory authorities in national security law, placing particular focus on the interstices between black letter law and areas where the field is either unsettled or in flux.<br/>A key aspect of the course design is that it retains both the doctrinal and <br/>AND<br/>giving students the opportunity to develop depth and breadth prior to the exercise.<br/>In order to capture problems related to adaptation and evolution, addressing goal 1<br/>AND<br/>Law to build the cyber portal used for NSL Sim 2.0.<br/>The twin goals of adaptation and evolution require that students be given a significant amount <br/>AND<br/>execution of the play, further developing their understanding of national security law.<br/>Throughout the simulation, the Control Team is constantly reacting to student choices. When unexpected decisions are made, professors may choose to pursue the evolution of the story to accomplish the pedagogical aims, or they may choose to cut off play in that area (there are various devices for doing so, such as denying requests, sending materials to labs to be analyzed, drawing the players back into the main storylines, and leaking information to the media).<br/>A total immersion simulation involves a number of scenarios, as well as systemic noise<br/>AND<br/>but to embrace them as part of the challenge facing national security lawyers.<br/>The simulation itself is problem-based, giving players agency in driving the evolution <br/>AND<br/>, generating in turn a set of new issues that must be addressed.<br/>The written and oral components of the simulation conform to the fourth pedagogical goal – <br/>AND<br/>simulation – and to deliver a 90 second oral briefing after the session.<br/>To replicate the high-stakes political environment at issue in goals (1) <br/>AND<br/>many different considerations that decisionmakers take into account in the national security domain.<br/>Scenarios are selected with high consequence events in mind, to ensure that students recognize <br/>AND<br/>to emphasize the broader political context within which national security law is practiced.<br/>Both anticipated and unanticipated decisions give rise to ethical questions and matters related to the <br/>AND<br/>exercise itself hitting the aim of the integration of the various pedagogical goals.<br/>Finally, there are multiple layers of feedback that players receive prior to, during<br/>AND<br/>, while another Control Team member may reject a FISC application as insufficient.<br/>The simulation goes beyond this, however, focusing on teaching students how to develop <br/>AND<br/>uncertainty, tension with colleagues, mistakes, and successes in the future.<br/>B. Substantive Areas: Interstices and Threats<br/>As a substantive matter, NSL Sim 2.0 is designed to take account <br/>AND<br/>weapons and pandemic disease also come within the doctrinal part of the course.<br/>The simulation itself is based on five to six storylines reflecting the interstices between different areas of the law. The storylines are used to present a coherent, non-linear scenario that can adapt to student responses. Each scenario is mapped out in a three to seven page document, which is then checked with scientists, government officials, and area experts for consistency with how the scenario would likely unfold in real life.<br/>For the biological weapons and pandemic disease emphasis, for example, one narrative might <br/>AND<br/>through press releases, weather updates, private communications, and the like.<br/>The five to six storylines, prepared by the Control Team in consultation with experts<br/>AND<br/>, giving the Control Team a birds-eye view of the progression.<br/>C. How It Works<br/>As for the nuts and bolts of the simulation itself, it traditionally begins outside of class, in the evening, on the grounds that national security crises often occur at inconvenient times and may well involve limited sleep and competing demands.171 Typically, a phone call from a Control Team member posing in a role integral to one of the main storylines, initiates play.<br/>Students at this point have been assigned dedicated simulation email addresses and provided access to <br/>AND<br/>relevant student teams. The Control Team has access to the complete site.<br/>For the next two (or three) days, outside of student initiatives (<br/>AND<br/>, or technology concerns, while setting the stage for the breaking crisis.<br/>The third (or fourth) day of play takes place entirely at Georgetown Law<br/>AND<br/>releases. Students use their own laptop computers for team decisions and communication.<br/>As the storylines unfold, the Control Team takes on a variety of roles, <br/>AND<br/>the simulation unfolded, and how the students performed in their various capacities.<br/>At the end of the day, the exercise terminates and an immediate hotwash is held, in which players are first debriefed on what occurred during the simulation. Because of the players’ divergent experiences and the different roles assigned to them, the students at this point are often unaware of the complete picture. The judges and formal observers then offer reflections on the simulation and determine which teams performed most effectively.<br/>Over the next few classes, more details about the simulation emerge, as students <br/>AND<br/>opportunities for learning in the future. The course then formally ends.172 <br/>Learning, however, continues beyond the temporal confines of the semester. Students who <br/>AND<br/>concerns. And it builds a strong community of individuals with common interests.<br/>CONCLUSION<br/>The legal academy has, of late, been swept up in concern about the <br/>AND<br/>both the expression of government authority and the effort to limit the same.<br/>The one-size fits all approach currently dominating the conversation in legal education, <br/>AND<br/>greater nuance in the discussion of the adequacy of the current pedagogical approach.<br/>With this approach in mind, I have here suggested six pedagogical goals for national <br/>AND<br/>to ensure that they will be most effective when they enter the field.<br/>The problem with the current structures in legal education is that they fall short, <br/>AND<br/>in other areas of experiential education, such as clinics and moot court.<br/>It is in an effort to address these concerns that I developed the simulation model <br/>AND<br/>undoubtedly necessary, it suggests one potential direction for the years to come.</p><p>Ontology is a DESTRUCTIVE HISTORICAL FICTION – any GATEWAY claims are just TRICKS based on how we SHELVE BOOKS <br/>Shirky 5 Clay Shirky, teacher of NYU's graduate Interactive Telecommunications Program, 03/15/05 <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail470.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail470.html%27" tppabs="http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail470.html"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail470.html</span></a></span><br/>&nbsp;I hold a joint appointment at NYU, as an Associate Arts Professor at the Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP) and as a Distinguished Writer in Residence in the Journalism Department.
