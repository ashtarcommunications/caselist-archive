It has since gone through multiple iterations.<br/>The initial concept followed on the federal full-scale Top Official ("TopOff") exercises, used to train government officials to respond to domestic crises.165 It adapted a Tabletop Exercise, designed with the help of exercise officials at DHS and FEMA, to the law school environment. The Tabletop used one storyline to push on specific legal questions, as students, assigned roles in the discussion, sat around a table and for six hours engaged with the material.<br/>The problem with the Tabletop Exercise was that it was too static, and the <br/>AND<br/>focused on specific legal issues, even as it controlled for external chaos.<br/>The opportunity to provide a more full experience for the students came with the creation of first a one-day, and then a multi-day simulation. The course design and simulation continues to evolve. It offers a model for achieving the pedagogical goals outlined above, in the process developing a rigorous training ground for the next generation of national security lawyers.166<br/>A. Course Design<br/>The central idea in structuring the NSL Sim 2.0 course was to bridge <br/>AND<br/>and legal education) and flexible (responsive to student input and decisionmaking).<br/>Perhaps the most significant weakness in the use of any constructed universe is the problem <br/>AND<br/>student decisions themselves must drive the evolution of events within the simulation.168<br/>Additionally, while authenticity matters, it is worth noting that at some level the <br/>AND<br/>that would be much more difficult to do in a regular practice setting.<br/>NSL Sim 2.0 takes as its starting point the national security pedagogical goals discussed above. It works backwards to then engineer a classroom, cyber, and physical/simulation experience to delve into each of these areas. As a substantive matter, the course focuses on the constitutional, statutory, and regulatory authorities in national security law, placing particular focus on the interstices between black letter law and areas where the field is either unsettled or in flux.<br/>A key aspect of the course design is that it retains both the doctrinal and <br/>AND<br/>giving students the opportunity to develop depth and breadth prior to the exercise.<br/>In order to capture problems related to adaptation and evolution, addressing goal ~1<br/>AND<br/>Law to build the cyber portal used for NSL Sim 2.0.<br/>The twin goals of adaptation and evolution require that students be given a significant amount <br/>AND<br/>execution of the play, further developing their understanding of national security law.<br/>Throughout the simulation, the Control Team is constantly reacting to student choices. When unexpected decisions are made, professors may choose to pursue the evolution of the story to accomplish the pedagogical aims, or they may choose to cut off play in that area (there are various devices for doing so, such as denying requests, sending materials to labs to be analyzed, drawing the players back into the main storylines, and leaking information to the media).<br/>A total immersion simulation involves a number of scenarios, as well as systemic noise<br/>AND<br/>but to embrace them as part of the challenge facing national security lawyers.<br/>The simulation itself is problem-based, giving players agency in driving the evolution <br/>AND<br/>, generating in turn a set of new issues that must be addressed.<br/>The written and oral components of the simulation conform to the fourth pedagogical goal – <br/>AND<br/>simulation – and to deliver a 90 second oral briefing after the session.<br/>To replicate the high-stakes political environment at issue in goals (1) <br/>AND<br/>many different considerations that decisionmakers take into account in the national security domain.<br/>Scenarios are selected with high consequence events in mind, to ensure that students recognize <br/>AND<br/>to emphasize the broader political context within which national security law is practiced.<br/>Both anticipated and unanticipated decisions give rise to ethical questions and matters related to the <br/>AND<br/>exercise itself hitting the aim of the integration of the various pedagogical goals.<br/>Finally, there are multiple layers of feedback that players receive prior to, during<br/>AND<br/>, while another Control Team member may reject a FISC application as insufficient.<br/>The simulation goes beyond this, however, focusing on teaching students how to develop <br/>AND<br/>uncertainty, tension with colleagues, mistakes, and successes in the future.<br/>B. Substantive Areas: Interstices and Threats<br/>As a substantive matter, NSL Sim 2.0 is designed to take account <br/>AND<br/>weapons and pandemic disease also come within the doctrinal part of the course.<br/>The simulation itself is based on five to six storylines reflecting the interstices between different areas of the law. The storylines are used to present a coherent, non-linear scenario that can adapt to student responses. Each scenario is mapped out in a three to seven page document, which is then checked with scientists, government officials, and area experts for consistency with how the scenario would likely unfold in real life.<br/>For the biological weapons and pandemic disease emphasis, for example, one narrative might <br/>AND<br/>through press releases, weather updates, private communications, and the like.<br/>The five to six storylines, prepared by the Control Team in consultation with experts<br/>AND<br/>, giving the Control Team a birds-eye view of the progression.<br/>C. How It Works<br/>As for the nuts and bolts of the simulation itself, it traditionally begins outside of class, in the evening, on the grounds that national security crises often occur at inconvenient times and may well involve limited sleep and competing demands.171 Typically, a phone call from a Control Team member posing in a role integral to one of the main storylines, initiates play.<br/>Students at this point have been assigned dedicated simulation email addresses and provided access to <br/>AND<br/>relevant student teams. The Control Team has access to the complete site.<br/>For the next two (or three) days, outside of student initiatives (<br/>AND<br/>, or technology concerns, while setting the stage for the breaking crisis.<br/>The third (or fourth) day of play takes place entirely at Georgetown Law<br/>AND<br/>releases. Students use their own laptop computers for team decisions and communication.<br/>As the storylines unfold, the Control Team takes on a variety of roles, <br/>AND<br/>the simulation unfolded, and how the students performed in their various capacities.<br/>At the end of the day, the exercise terminates and an immediate hotwash is held, in which players are first debriefed on what occurred during the simulation. Because of the players’ divergent experiences and the different roles assigned to them, the students at this point are often unaware of the complete picture. The judges and formal observers then offer reflections on the simulation and determine which teams performed most effectively.<br/>Over the next few classes, more details about the simulation emerge, as students <br/>AND<br/>opportunities for learning in the future. The course then formally ends.172 <br/>Learning, however, continues beyond the temporal confines of the semester. Students who <br/>AND<br/>concerns. And it builds a strong community of individuals with common interests.<br/>CONCLUSION<br/>The legal academy has, of late, been swept up in concern about the <br/>AND<br/>both the expression of government authority and the effort to limit the same.<br/>The one-size fits all approach currently dominating the conversation in legal education, <br/>AND<br/>greater nuance in the discussion of the adequacy of the current pedagogical approach.<br/>With this approach in mind, I have here suggested six pedagogical goals for national <br/>AND<br/>to ensure that they will be most effective when they enter the field.<br/>The problem with the current structures in legal education is that they fall short, <br/>AND<br/>in other areas of experiential education, such as clinics and moot court.<br/>It is in an effort to address these concerns that I developed the simulation model <br/>AND<br/>undoubtedly necessary, it suggests one potential direction for the years to come.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h2 id="Hoff2" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>off 2</span></h2><p>Demands for presencing of those marked as abject reinscribes the Hegelian dialectic of life and death that makes the social death possible in the first place.<br/><strong>Peterson ’6</strong><br/>Christopher, "The Return of the Body: Judith Butler’s Dialectical Corporealism," Discourse, 28.2263, Spring 26 Fall 2006, pp. 153-177 (Article)</p><p>In contemporary cultural studies, the body is laden with intense desires and expectations. <br/>AND<br/>that very tradition that deconstruction has made it its mission to displace.11</p><p>Disawoval of finitude is the foundational condition for all American violence—the impact is ever-escalating cycles of destruction. <br/><strong>Peterson ’7</strong><br/>Christopher, Kindred Specters: Death, Mourning and American Affinity, University of Minnesota Press</p><p>The popularity of Six Feet Under notwithstanding, American culture tends not to acknowledge the <br/>AND<br/>life and death, to resist the racist and heterosexist disavowal of finitude.</p><p>The alternative is to vote negative to endorse the politics of spectrality.

Within weeks, the nation will default on its debt if an agreement isn’t reached to raise the federal debt limit.<br/>For some Republicans, those deadlines represent a leverage point that can be used to force Obama to slash his health care law. For others, they’re a zero hour at which the party will implode if it doesn’t cut a deal.<br/>Meanwhile, "on the looming fiscal issues, Democrats — both liberal and conservative, executive and congressional — are virtually 100 percent united," said Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.).<br/>Just a few days ago, all that Obama and his aides could talk about were Syria and Summers. Now, they’re bringing their party together and shining a white hot light on Republican disunity over whether to shut down the government and plunge the nation into default in a vain effort to stop Obamacare from going into effect.<br/>The squabbling among Republicans has gotten so vicious that a Twitter hashtag — ~23GOPvsGOPugliness — has become a thick virtual data file for tracking the intraparty insults. Moderates, and even some conservatives, are slamming Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, a tea party favorite, for ramping up grassroots expectations that the GOP will shut down the government if it can’t win concessions from the president to "defund" his signature health care law.<br/>"I didn’t go to Harvard or Princeton, but I can count," Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) tweeted, subtly mocking Cruz’s Ivy League education. "The defunding box canyon is a tactic that will fail and weaken our position."<br/>While it is well-timed for the White House to interrupt a bad slide, Obama’s singular focus on the budget battle is hardly a last-minute shift. Instead, it is a return to the narrative arc that the White House was working to build before the Syria crisis intervened.<br/>And it’s so important to the president’s strategy that White House officials didn’t consider postponing Monday’s rollout of the most partisan and high-stakes phase even when a shooter murdered a dozen people at Washington’s Navy Yard that morning.<br/>The basic storyline, well under way over the summer, was to have the <br/>AND<br/>leverage a debt-ceiling increase for Obamacare cuts would reverse progress made.<br/>The president is on firm ground, White House officials say, because he stands with the public in believing that the government shouldn’t shut down and that the country should pay its bills.</p><p>The plan causes an inter-branch fight that derails Obama’s agenda<br/>Douglas <strong>Kriner</strong>, Assistant Profess of Political Science at Boston University, 20<strong>10</strong>, After the Rubicon: Congress, Presidents, and the Politics of Waging War, p. 67-69</p><p>Raising or Lowering Political Costs by Affecting Presidential Political Capital<br/>Shaping both real and anticipated public opinion are two important ways in which Congress can <br/>AND<br/>were more important to the president than achieving unconditional victory over North Korea."<br/>While congressional support leaves the president’s reserve of political capital intact, congressional criticism saps <br/>AND<br/>that had suffered the highest casualty rates in the Iraq War.6°<br/>In addition to boding ill for the president’s perceived political capital and reputation, such <br/>AND<br/>a rear-guard action against congressional critics of the war in Iraq.<br/>When making their cost-benefit calculations, presidents surely consider these wider political costs of congressional opposition to their military policies.

Hungry people will fight to survive. Governments will use force to maintain internal order at home. This section considers the geopolitical repercussion of economic collapse, beginning with the United States.<br/>First, the U.S. government’s tax revenues would collapse with the depression<br/>AND<br/>foreign funding for the U.S. budget deficit would dry up.<br/>Consequently, the government would have to sharply curtail its spending, both at home <br/>AND<br/>might be the military that ultimately determines how the country would be governed.<br/>The political battle over America’s future would be bitter, and quite possibly bloody. It cannot be guaranteed that the U.S. Constitution would survive.<br/>Foreign affairs would also confront the United States with enormous challenges. During the Great <br/>AND<br/>could not finance its military in the same way it does at present.<br/>Therefore, either the United States would have to find an alternative funding method for its global military presence or else it would have to radically scale it back. Historically, empires were financed with plunder and territorial expropriation. The estates of the vanquished ruling classes were given to the conquering generals, while the rest of the population was forced to pay imperial taxes.<br/>The U.S. model of empire has been unique. It has financed <br/>AND<br/>The United States would have to maintain control over them whatever the price.<br/>In this global depression scenario, the price of oil could collapse to 243 <br/>AND<br/>given that mass unemployment would inevitably lead to a sharp spike in crime.<br/>Only after the Middle East oil was secured would the country know how much more of its global military presence it could afford to maintain.<br/>If international trade had broken down, would there be any reason for the United <br/>AND<br/>for U.S. protection. Retreat from Asia might become unavoidable.<br/>And Europe? What would a cost–benefit analysis conclude about the wisdom of the United States maintaining military bases there? What valued added does Europe provide to the United States? Necessity may mean Europe will have to defend itself.<br/>Should a New Great Depression put an end to the Pax Americana, the world <br/>AND<br/>(other than North Korea, which is largely a Chinese satellite state).<br/>However, in this disaster scenario, it is not certain that China would survive <br/>AND<br/>China’s provinces, ruled by warlords, were at war with one another.<br/>United or divided, China’s nuclear arsenal would make it Asia’s undisputed superpower if the <br/>AND<br/>be able to prevent mass migration southward, even if it wanted to.<br/>In Europe, severe economic hardship would revive the centuries-old struggle between the <br/>AND<br/>democratic institutions would hold up better this time that they did last time.<br/>England had an empire during the Great Depression. Now it only has banks. In a severe worldwide depression, the country— or, at least London—could become ungovernable. Frustration over poverty and a lack of jobs would erupt into anti-immigration riots not only in the United Kingdom but also across most of Europe.<br/>The extent to which Russia would menace its European neighbors is unclear. On the one hand, Russia would be impoverished by the collapse in oil prices and might be too preoccupied with internal unrest to threaten anyone. On the other hand, it could provoke a war with the goal of maintaining internal order through emergency wartime powers.<br/>Germany is very nearly demilitarized today when compared with the late 1930s. Lacking a nuclear deterrent of its own, it could be subject to Russian intimidation. While Germany could appeal for protection from England and France, who do have nuclear capabilities, it is uncertain that would buy Germany enough time to remilitarize before it became a victim of Eastern aggression.<br/>As for the rest of the world, its prospects in this disaster scenario can <br/>AND<br/>by an even more calamitous global war that killed approximately 60 million people.</p><h2 id="HXOCP" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>XO CP</span></h2><p>The executive branch of the United States federal government should issue and enforce an executive order to plan mandate.

It is unlikely that any future crisis will be met solely by the United States. Foreign countries and the United States are together on battlefield of Iraq and Afghanistan, and they will be in cyber space as well.<br/>Joint Publication 3-13 states:<br/>Allies and coalition partners recognize various ~information operations~ concepts and some have thorough <br/>AND<br/>and achievable IO strategy can be developed early in the planning process.73<br/>Foreign partners are critical to the success of U.S. military operations in all the domains. A new cyber doctrine will clarify the U.S. policy in cyberspace for all allies.<br/>IV. OTHER CONSIDERATIONS<br/>The most significant policy issues facing any cyberpower projection is the applicability of the Law of War (LOW). The legal questions must be examined and resolved in detail.74 The relationship between the laws of war and cyber operations will evolve, but a baseline policy position must involve the entire U.S. government.<br/>Scrutiny should focus on the definitions of "armed attack," as well as "distinction" and "proportionality" as applied to cyber operations.75 The U.N. Charter provides guidance for responses to armed attacks. The proper classification of cyber activity as an armed attack is much more difficult than the drafters of the U.N. Charter ever envisioned. These issues are ripe for debate and could be addressed in drafting the guiding principles for a national cyber doctrine.<br/>There is a presumption that the rules of engagement in cyber doctrine "will follow <br/>AND<br/>malicious actors consider that no boundaries exist between military and civilian targets."77<br/>The law frequently lags behind technology, but the consequences of adversarial actions against the United States and the responses of the Cyber Command illustrate the importance of establishing legitimate legal bases for defensive and offensive cyber operations. "The potentially nonlethal nature of cyber weapons may cloud the assessment of an attack’s legality, leading to more frequent violations of the principle of distinction in this new form of warfare than in conventional warfare."78<br/>For these reasons, legal experts in the national security sector must engage in the development of the new cyber doctrine.

Technology, Power Shifts, and the Strategic Logic of Legal Interpretation<br/>With these relationships between law and power in mind, the United States has an <br/>AND<br/>quo distribution of power built on traditional measures like military and economic might.<br/>It is not surprising that the United States seems inclined toward an interpretation of Articles <br/>AND</p><dl><dt>these strengths are therefore inextricably linked to new and emerging vulnerabilities.144<br/>Although some experts assess that the United States is currently strong relative to others in terms of offensive capabilities,145 several factors make the United States especially vulnerable to cyber-attack, including the informational and electronic interconnectedness of its military and public and private sectors, and political obstacles to curing some of these vulnerabilities through regulation.146 As the Obama administration’s 2010 National Security Strategy acknowledged:<br/>The very technologies that empower us to lead and create also empower those who would disrupt and destroy. They enable our military superiority . . . . Our daily lives and public safety depend on power and electric grids, but potential adversaries could use cyber vulnerabilities to disrupt them on a massive scale.147<br/>In other words, U.S. technological strengths create corresponding exposures to threats<br/>AND<br/>U.S. government reliance on other elements of a defensive strategy.<br/>In that light, U.S. legal interpretations and declaratory postures that define <br/>AND<br/>vast military edge (and it helps signal a willingness to do so).<br/>Put another way, the United States appears to be placing hedged bets about what <br/>AND<br/>, it may help articulate and deter the crossing of red lines.153<br/>In trying to explain what may be driving the U.S. interpretation, this Article is neither affirming nor denying this strategic logic, which is contingent on future capabilities and vulnerabilities that are both highly uncertain and shrouded in secrecy. Rather, it is trying to uncover and scrutinize some of the underlying assumptions.<br/>There are several strategic reasons for the United States to be cautious in considering interpretations <br/>AND<br/>reach consensus (the difficulties of which are discussed in the next Section).<br/>Depending on the relative risk of different types of future cyber-attack scenarios, <br/>AND<br/>international system by eroding normative constraints on military responses to nonmilitary harms.157<br/>As the following Section explores, it is very difficult to assess these risk balances because the global security environment is shifting dramatically and unpredictably. Moreover, even if the United States could assess the risks accurately, other states may be operating under different sets of strategic assumptions about that future.<br/>C. Divergent Interests and Implications for Charter Interpretation<br/>Assuming the United States decides firmly on a legal interpretation going forward, the redrawing <br/>AND<br/>of power for deterrence, self-defense, enforcement, and influence.<br/>Again, one should not divorce analysis of any proposed content of Articles 2(<br/>AND<br/>of built-in ~legal~ ambiguities as future political weapons."160<br/>That is, even if states widely share a common, minimum interest in restricting some cyber-attacks, states may have divergent interests regarding specific substantive content as well as the desired degree of clarity in the law. Salient differences will likely stem from asymmetries of geostrategic ambitions, internal and external commitment to legal norms generally, and the nature and extent of public-private institutional relationships.161<br/>In contrast to the United States, some states that are developing offensive cyber-<br/>AND<br/>Individually, though, they will have little power to promote those principles.<br/>Like the United States, other major actors may have much to lose from cyber<br/>AND<br/>concerns about military escalation of crises and divergent strategic assessments among themselves.172<br/>Differences in internal politics, ideology, and government control over information will also shape <br/>AND<br/>of cyber-attacks without some unlikely concessions by the United States.175<br/>From a policy standpoint, this should sound another cautionary note about efforts to build <br/>AND<br/>on a different set of objectives, capabilities, vulnerabilities, and constraints.</dt></dl><p>International law doesn’t change state action—no compliance and selective interpretation of the law. <br/><strong>Posner 12</strong> (Eric, law prof, Slate, "Obama’s Drone Dilemma", Oct. 8, 2012, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/view_from_chicago/2012/10/obama_s_drone_war_is_probably_illegal_will_it_stop_.single.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/view_from_chicago/2012/10/obama_s_drone_war_is_probably_illegal_will_it_stop_.single.html%27" tppabs="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/view_from_chicago/2012/10/obama_s_drone_war_is_probably_illegal_will_it_stop_.single.html"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/view_from_chicago/2012/10/obama_s_drone_war_is_probably_illegal_will_it_stop_.single.html</span></a></span>, ZBurdette)</p><p>The Wall Street Journal recently reported on debates within the Obama administration about the legality <br/>AND<br/>near the edge" of illegality but does not quite tumble over it.<br/>That is a questionable judgment.

Publicly and officially the country <br/>AND<br/>. But after the raid, the ISI stopped sending back the acknowledgments.<br/>Now what to do? The administration argues that consent can still be inferred despite the unanswered faxes. The reason is that "the Pakistani military continues to clear airspace for drones and doesn’t interfere physically with the unpiloted aircraft in flight"—meaning that Pakistan does not shoot down the drones or permit private aircraft to collide with them.<br/>We might call this "coerced consent." Consider it this way: You walk <br/>AND<br/>, it is deemed to consent to the bombing of its own territory.<br/>But don’t blame government lawyers like Koh for devising this theory.

It is too easy for states to characterize other states as long-term threats regardless of whether they are.

They have not cited the United Nations Charter, which flatly bans military interventions without Security Council approval, which the United States cannot obtain because of Russian and Chinese opposition.<br/>The Geneva Protocol of 1925 (which Syria ratified) and the Chemical Weapons Convention <br/>AND<br/>, that rule has been superseded by the U.N.

Of course it is. Nobody said it wasn’t. Risk is the probability of harm multiplied by its cost. The question thus has two parts: how likely are acts of violent, computer-executed sabotage, and how damaging could those acts be? Could computer network attacks rise to a level that sensible people would call "cyber-warfare"? <br/>The answer: probably not—for four reasons. <br/>First, facts matter. Facts must drive analysis, not fear. That means <br/>AND<br/>in store. Sometimes the unexpected happens. Which leads to reason two.<br/>Intentions matter. Most likely some states have the capability to hack critical infrastructure. <br/>AND<br/>the intensity of the damage would probably remain more limited than broadly assumed. <br/>Because, third, intelligence matters. Penetrating complex targets requires intelligence, highly detailed<br/>AND<br/>not available easily on the web. It also means targeting is bespoke.<br/>Lastly, of course, technology matters. Richard Bejtlich argues that "the power to access data via unauthorised means inherently contains the power to destroy that data". This is indeed true in conventional IT security, or espionage, where confidentiality, integrity and availability of data have to be protected, in this order of priority: C-I-A. But, as the opposition knows, the same does not apply for industrial control systems—the golden target in "cyber-warfare". <br/>For the engineers who run power plants, water facilities, or chemical factories, <br/>AND<br/>internet indeed are, but not the most critical ones like nuclear plants. <br/>In sum: stolen and occasionally deleted data are a problem of major proportions, not just a risk.

It has since gone through multiple iterations.<br/>The initial concept followed on the federal full-scale Top Official ("TopOff") exercises, used to train government officials to respond to domestic crises.165 It adapted a Tabletop Exercise, designed with the help of exercise officials at DHS and FEMA, to the law school environment. The Tabletop used one storyline to push on specific legal questions, as students, assigned roles in the discussion, sat around a table and for six hours engaged with the material.<br/>The problem with the Tabletop Exercise was that it was too static, and the <br/>AND<br/>focused on specific legal issues, even as it controlled for external chaos.<br/>The opportunity to provide a more full experience for the students came with the creation of first a one-day, and then a multi-day simulation. The course design and simulation continues to evolve. It offers a model for achieving the pedagogical goals outlined above, in the process developing a rigorous training ground for the next generation of national security lawyers.166<br/>A. Course Design<br/>The central idea in structuring the NSL Sim 2.0 course was to bridge <br/>AND<br/>and legal education) and flexible (responsive to student input and decisionmaking).<br/>Perhaps the most significant weakness in the use of any constructed universe is the problem <br/>AND<br/>student decisions themselves must drive the evolution of events within the simulation.168<br/>Additionally, while authenticity matters, it is worth noting that at some level the <br/>AND<br/>that would be much more difficult to do in a regular practice setting.<br/>NSL Sim 2.0 takes as its starting point the national security pedagogical goals discussed above. It works backwards to then engineer a classroom, cyber, and physical/simulation experience to delve into each of these areas. As a substantive matter, the course focuses on the constitutional, statutory, and regulatory authorities in national security law, placing particular focus on the interstices between black letter law and areas where the field is either unsettled or in flux.<br/>A key aspect of the course design is that it retains both the doctrinal and <br/>AND<br/>giving students the opportunity to develop depth and breadth prior to the exercise.<br/>In order to capture problems related to adaptation and evolution, addressing goal ~1<br/>AND<br/>Law to build the cyber portal used for NSL Sim 2.0.<br/>The twin goals of adaptation and evolution require that students be given a significant amount <br/>AND<br/>execution of the play, further developing their understanding of national security law.<br/>Throughout the simulation, the Control Team is constantly reacting to student choices. When unexpected decisions are made, professors may choose to pursue the evolution of the story to accomplish the pedagogical aims, or they may choose to cut off play in that area (there are various devices for doing so, such as denying requests, sending materials to labs to be analyzed, drawing the players back into the main storylines, and leaking information to the media).<br/>A total immersion simulation involves a number of scenarios, as well as systemic noise<br/>AND<br/>but to embrace them as part of the challenge facing national security lawyers.<br/>The simulation itself is problem-based, giving players agency in driving the evolution <br/>AND<br/>, generating in turn a set of new issues that must be addressed.<br/>The written and oral components of the simulation conform to the fourth pedagogical goal – <br/>AND<br/>simulation – and to deliver a 90 second oral briefing after the session.<br/>To replicate the high-stakes political environment at issue in goals (1) <br/>AND<br/>many different considerations that decisionmakers take into account in the national security domain.<br/>Scenarios are selected with high consequence events in mind, to ensure that students recognize <br/>AND<br/>to emphasize the broader political context within which national security law is practiced.<br/>Both anticipated and unanticipated decisions give rise to ethical questions and matters related to the <br/>AND<br/>exercise itself hitting the aim of the integration of the various pedagogical goals.<br/>Finally, there are multiple layers of feedback that players receive prior to, during<br/>AND<br/>, while another Control Team member may reject a FISC application as insufficient.<br/>The simulation goes beyond this, however, focusing on teaching students how to develop <br/>AND<br/>uncertainty, tension with colleagues, mistakes, and successes in the future.<br/>B. Substantive Areas: Interstices and Threats<br/>As a substantive matter, NSL Sim 2.0 is designed to take account <br/>AND<br/>weapons and pandemic disease also come within the doctrinal part of the course.<br/>The simulation itself is based on five to six storylines reflecting the interstices between different areas of the law. The storylines are used to present a coherent, non-linear scenario that can adapt to student responses. Each scenario is mapped out in a three to seven page document, which is then checked with scientists, government officials, and area experts for consistency with how the scenario would likely unfold in real life.<br/>For the biological weapons and pandemic disease emphasis, for example, one narrative might <br/>AND<br/>through press releases, weather updates, private communications, and the like.<br/>The five to six storylines, prepared by the Control Team in consultation with experts<br/>AND<br/>, giving the Control Team a birds-eye view of the progression.<br/>C. How It Works<br/>As for the nuts and bolts of the simulation itself, it traditionally begins outside of class, in the evening, on the grounds that national security crises often occur at inconvenient times and may well involve limited sleep and competing demands.171 Typically, a phone call from a Control Team member posing in a role integral to one of the main storylines, initiates play.<br/>Students at this point have been assigned dedicated simulation email addresses and provided access to <br/>AND<br/>relevant student teams. The Control Team has access to the complete site.<br/>For the next two (or three) days, outside of student initiatives (<br/>AND<br/>, or technology concerns, while setting the stage for the breaking crisis.<br/>The third (or fourth) day of play takes place entirely at Georgetown Law<br/>AND<br/>releases. Students use their own laptop computers for team decisions and communication.<br/>As the storylines unfold, the Control Team takes on a variety of roles, <br/>AND<br/>the simulation unfolded, and how the students performed in their various capacities.<br/>At the end of the day, the exercise terminates and an immediate hotwash is held, in which players are first debriefed on what occurred during the simulation. Because of the players’ divergent experiences and the different roles assigned to them, the students at this point are often unaware of the complete picture. The judges and formal observers then offer reflections on the simulation and determine which teams performed most effectively.<br/>Over the next few classes, more details about the simulation emerge, as students <br/>AND<br/>opportunities for learning in the future. The course then formally ends.172 <br/>Learning, however, continues beyond the temporal confines of the semester. Students who <br/>AND<br/>concerns.

Johnston is an associate political scientist at the RAND Corporation, a nonprofit, nonpartisan research institution. He is the author of "Does Decapitation Work? Assessing the Effectiveness of Leadership Targeting in Counterinsurgency Campaigns," published in International Security (Spring 2012)., 8/22/2012, "Drone Strikes Keep Pressure on al-Qaida", www.rand.org/blog/2012/08/drone-strikes-keep-pressure-on-al-qaida.html)</p><p>Should the U.S. continue to strike at al-Qaida’s leadership with drone attacks? A recent poll shows that while most Americans approve of drone strikes, in 17 out of 20 countries, more than half of those surveyed disapprove of them.<br/>My study of leadership decapitation in 90 counter-insurgencies since the 1970s shows that when militant leaders are captured or killed militant attacks decrease, terrorist campaigns end sooner, and their outcomes tend to favor the government or third-party country, not the militants.<br/>Those opposed to drone strikes often cite the June 2009 one that targeted Pakistani Taliban <br/>AND<br/>cited drone strikes as a key motivation for his May 2010 attempted attack.<br/>Compared to manned aircraft, drones have some advantages as counter-insurgency tools, such as lower costs, longer endurance and the lack of a pilot to place in harm’s way and risk of capture. These characteristics can enable a more deliberative targeting process that serves to minimize unintentional casualties. But the weapons employed by drones are usually identical to those used via manned aircraft and can still kill civilians—creating enmity that breeds more terrorists.<br/>Yet many insurgents and terrorists have been taken off the battlefield by U.S. drones and special-operations forces. Besides Mehsud, the list includes Anwar al-Awlaki of al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula; al-Qaida deputy leader Abu Yahya al-Li-bi; and, of course, al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden. Given that list, it is possible that the drone program has prevented numerous attacks by their potential followers, like Shazad.<br/>What does the removal of al-Qaida leadership mean for U.S. national security? Though many in al-Qaida’s senior leadership cadre remain, the historical record suggests that "decapitation" will likely weaken the organization and could cripple its ability to conduct major attacks on the U.S. homeland.<br/>Killing terrorist leaders is not necessarily a knockout blow, but can make it harder for terrorists to attack the U.S. Members of al-Qaida’s central leadership, once safely amassed in northwestern Pakistan while America shifted its focus to Iraq, have been killed, captured, forced underground or scattered to various locations with little ability to communicate or move securely.<br/>Recently declassified correspondence seized in the bin Laden raid shows that the relentless pressure from the drone campaign on al-Qaida in Pakistan led bin Laden to advise al-Qaida operatives to leave Pakistan’s Tribal Areas as no longer safe.

That may sound like a <br/>AND<br/>academic debates, this might get mildly theoretical and even more mildly methodological.<br/>Concerning international wars, one version of the "nuclear-peace" theory is not in fact laid to rest by the data. It is certainly true that nuclear-armed states have been involved in many wars. They have even been attacked (think of Israel), which falsifies the simple claim of "assured destruction"—that any nuclear country A will deter any kind of attack by any country B because B fears a retaliatory nuclear strike from A.<br/>But the most important "nuclear-peace" claim has been about mutually assured <br/>AND<br/>that states with a second-strike capability will not fight one another.<br/>Their colossal atomic arsenals neither kept the United States at peace with North Vietnam during <br/>AND<br/>War III, and little about the wisdom of banning the Bomb now.<br/>Regarding the downward trend in international war, Professor Mack is friendlier to more palatable <br/>AND<br/>superpower support for rival rebel factions in so many Third-World countries).<br/>These are all plausible mechanisms for peace. What is more, none of them <br/>AND<br/>and whether both might support international cooperation, including to end civil wars.<br/>We would still need to explain how this charmed circle of causes got started, however. And here let me raise another factor, perhaps even less appealing than the "nuclear peace" thesis, at least outside of the United States. That factor is what international relations scholars call hegemony—specifically American hegemony.<br/>A theory that many regard as discredited, but that refuses to go away, <br/>AND<br/>been good for the world that the United States has been so predominant.<br/>There is no obvious reason why hegemonic stability theory could not apply to other areas of international cooperation, including in security affairs, human rights, international law, peacekeeping (UN or otherwise), and so on. What I want to suggest here—suggest, not test—is that American hegemony might just be a deep cause of the steady decline of political deaths in the world.<br/>How could that be? After all, the report states that United States is the third most war-prone country since 1945. Many of the deaths depicted in Figure 10.4 were in wars that involved the United States (the Vietnam War being the leading one). Notwithstanding politicians’ claims to the contrary, a candid look at U.S. foreign policy reveals that the country is as ruthlessly self-interested as any other great power in history.<br/>The answer is that U.S. hegemony might just be a deeper cause <br/>AND<br/>War most of its allies accepted some degree of market-driven growth.<br/>Second, the U.S.-led western victory in the Cold War damaged <br/>AND<br/>in part by the emergence of the United States as the global hegemon.<br/>The same case can be made, with somewhat more difficulty, concerning the spread <br/>AND<br/>U.S. material and moral support for liberal democracy remains strong.</p><p>You should choose not to believe their impacts – psychology privileges the argument that the world is getting worse – but it’s conclusively not<br/>Steven Pinker 11, professor of psychology at Harvard, The Better Angels of our Nature, October, googlebooks</p><p>This book is about what may be the most important thing that has ever happened <br/>AND<br/>there could be anything good about civilization, modernity, and Western society.&nbsp;</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>But perhaps the main cause of the illusion of ever-present violence springs from <br/>AND<br/>terms of psychology and history: how human minds deal with changing circumstances.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h1 id="H1NR-2" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>1NR</span></h1><h2 id="HDA-3" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>DA</span></h2><p>The aff jeopardizes warfighting and undermines determination<br/>Eyago 05 &nbsp;Political Commentary – Sound Politics Reporter ~7/8, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.soundpolitics.com/archives/004721.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.soundpolitics.com/archives/004721.html%27" tppabs="http://www.soundpolitics.com/archives/004721.html"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.soundpolitics.com/archives/004721.html</span></a></span>, Sound Commentary on Current Events in Seattle, Puget Sound and Washington State~</p><p>Finally, I am angry at those who undermine our efforts to conduct this war<br/>AND<br/>our public leaders.

It has since gone through multiple iterations.<br/>The initial concept followed on the federal full-scale Top Official ("TopOff") exercises, used to train government officials to respond to domestic crises.165 It adapted a Tabletop Exercise, designed with the help of exercise officials at DHS and FEMA, to the law school environment. The Tabletop used one storyline to push on specific legal questions, as students, assigned roles in the discussion, sat around a table and for six hours engaged with the material.<br/>The problem with the Tabletop Exercise was that it was too static, and the <br/>AND<br/>focused on specific legal issues, even as it controlled for external chaos.<br/>The opportunity to provide a more full experience for the students came with the creation of first a one-day, and then a multi-day simulation. The course design and simulation continues to evolve. It offers a model for achieving the pedagogical goals outlined above, in the process developing a rigorous training ground for the next generation of national security lawyers.166<br/>A. Course Design<br/>The central idea in structuring the NSL Sim 2.0 course was to bridge <br/>AND<br/>and legal education) and flexible (responsive to student input and decisionmaking).<br/>Perhaps the most significant weakness in the use of any constructed universe is the problem <br/>AND<br/>student decisions themselves must drive the evolution of events within the simulation.168<br/>Additionally, while authenticity matters, it is worth noting that at some level the <br/>AND<br/>that would be much more difficult to do in a regular practice setting.<br/>NSL Sim 2.0 takes as its starting point the national security pedagogical goals discussed above. It works backwards to then engineer a classroom, cyber, and physical/simulation experience to delve into each of these areas. As a substantive matter, the course focuses on the constitutional, statutory, and regulatory authorities in national security law, placing particular focus on the interstices between black letter law and areas where the field is either unsettled or in flux.<br/>A key aspect of the course design is that it retains both the doctrinal and <br/>AND<br/>giving students the opportunity to develop depth and breadth prior to the exercise.<br/>In order to capture problems related to adaptation and evolution, addressing goal ~1<br/>AND<br/>Law to build the cyber portal used for NSL Sim 2.0.<br/>The twin goals of adaptation and evolution require that students be given a significant amount <br/>AND<br/>execution of the play, further developing their understanding of national security law.<br/>Throughout the simulation, the Control Team is constantly reacting to student choices. When unexpected decisions are made, professors may choose to pursue the evolution of the story to accomplish the pedagogical aims, or they may choose to cut off play in that area (there are various devices for doing so, such as denying requests, sending materials to labs to be analyzed, drawing the players back into the main storylines, and leaking information to the media).<br/>A total immersion simulation involves a number of scenarios, as well as systemic noise<br/>AND<br/>but to embrace them as part of the challenge facing national security lawyers.<br/>The simulation itself is problem-based, giving players agency in driving the evolution <br/>AND<br/>, generating in turn a set of new issues that must be addressed.<br/>The written and oral components of the simulation conform to the fourth pedagogical goal – <br/>AND<br/>simulation – and to deliver a 90 second oral briefing after the session.<br/>To replicate the high-stakes political environment at issue in goals (1) <br/>AND<br/>many different considerations that decisionmakers take into account in the national security domain.<br/>Scenarios are selected with high consequence events in mind, to ensure that students recognize <br/>AND<br/>to emphasize the broader political context within which national security law is practiced.<br/>Both anticipated and unanticipated decisions give rise to ethical questions and matters related to the <br/>AND<br/>exercise itself hitting the aim of the integration of the various pedagogical goals.<br/>Finally, there are multiple layers of feedback that players receive prior to, during<br/>AND<br/>, while another Control Team member may reject a FISC application as insufficient.<br/>The simulation goes beyond this, however, focusing on teaching students how to develop <br/>AND<br/>uncertainty, tension with colleagues, mistakes, and successes in the future.<br/>B. Substantive Areas: Interstices and Threats<br/>As a substantive matter, NSL Sim 2.0 is designed to take account <br/>AND<br/>weapons and pandemic disease also come within the doctrinal part of the course.<br/>The simulation itself is based on five to six storylines reflecting the interstices between different areas of the law. The storylines are used to present a coherent, non-linear scenario that can adapt to student responses. Each scenario is mapped out in a three to seven page document, which is then checked with scientists, government officials, and area experts for consistency with how the scenario would likely unfold in real life.<br/>For the biological weapons and pandemic disease emphasis, for example, one narrative might <br/>AND<br/>through press releases, weather updates, private communications, and the like.<br/>The five to six storylines, prepared by the Control Team in consultation with experts<br/>AND<br/>, giving the Control Team a birds-eye view of the progression.<br/>C. How It Works<br/>As for the nuts and bolts of the simulation itself, it traditionally begins outside of class, in the evening, on the grounds that national security crises often occur at inconvenient times and may well involve limited sleep and competing demands.171 Typically, a phone call from a Control Team member posing in a role integral to one of the main storylines, initiates play.<br/>Students at this point have been assigned dedicated simulation email addresses and provided access to <br/>AND<br/>relevant student teams. The Control Team has access to the complete site.<br/>For the next two (or three) days, outside of student initiatives (<br/>AND<br/>, or technology concerns, while setting the stage for the breaking crisis.<br/>The third (or fourth) day of play takes place entirely at Georgetown Law<br/>AND<br/>releases. Students use their own laptop computers for team decisions and communication.<br/>As the storylines unfold, the Control Team takes on a variety of roles, <br/>AND<br/>the simulation unfolded, and how the students performed in their various capacities.<br/>At the end of the day, the exercise terminates and an immediate hotwash is held, in which players are first debriefed on what occurred during the simulation. Because of the players’ divergent experiences and the different roles assigned to them, the students at this point are often unaware of the complete picture. The judges and formal observers then offer reflections on the simulation and determine which teams performed most effectively.<br/>Over the next few classes, more details about the simulation emerge, as students <br/>AND<br/>opportunities for learning in the future. The course then formally ends.172 <br/>Learning, however, continues beyond the temporal confines of the semester. Students who <br/>AND<br/>concerns. And it builds a strong community of individuals with common interests.<br/>CONCLUSION<br/>The legal academy has, of late, been swept up in concern about the <br/>AND<br/>both the expression of government authority and the effort to limit the same.<br/>The one-size fits all approach currently dominating the conversation in legal education, <br/>AND<br/>greater nuance in the discussion of the adequacy of the current pedagogical approach.<br/>With this approach in mind, I have here suggested six pedagogical goals for national <br/>AND<br/>to ensure that they will be most effective when they enter the field.<br/>The problem with the current structures in legal education is that they fall short, <br/>AND<br/>in other areas of experiential education, such as clinics and moot court.<br/>It is in an effort to address these concerns that I developed the simulation model <br/>AND<br/>undoubtedly necessary, it suggests one potential direction for the years to come.</p><p>Decision making—</p><p>Linking the ballot to a should question in combination with USFG simulation teaches the skills to organize pragmatic consequences and philosophical values into a course of action<br/><strong>Hanghoj 8</strong><br/><span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://static.sdu.dk/mediafiles/Files/Information_til/Studerende_ved_SDU/Din_uddannelse/phd_hum/afhandlinger/2009/ThorkilHanghoej.pdf  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://static.sdu.dk/mediafiles/Files/Information_til/Studerende_ved_SDU/Din_uddannelse/phd_hum/afhandlinger/2009/ThorkilHanghoej.pdf%27" tppabs="http://static.sdu.dk/mediafiles/Files/Information_til/Studerende_ved_SDU/Din_uddannelse/phd_hum/afhandlinger/2009/ThorkilHanghoej.pdf"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://static.sdu.dk/mediafiles/Files/Information_til/Studerende_ved_SDU/Din_uddannelse/phd_hum/afhandlinger/2009/ThorkilHanghoej.pdf</span></a></span> Thorkild Hanghøj, Copenhagen, 2008 Since this PhD project began in 2004, the present author has been affiliated with DREAM (Danish Research Centre on Education and Advanced Media Materials), which is located at the Institute of Literature, Media and Cultural Studies at the University of Southern Denmark.

But the list of Boehner’s past retreats offers a glimmer of hope, especially to advocates of immigration reform. Though it has languished in the House, an immigration overhaul passed with bipartisan support in the Senate, and was given a fresh push by Obama in the aftermath of the debt limit deal.<br/>The big mystery that immigration advocates need to figure out: What makes Boehner cave? Is there a common thread? Is there a sequence of buttons you can push that forces Boehner to relent?<br/>Two of this year’s caves happened when Boehner was backed up against hard deadlines: <br/>AND<br/>both times, but he was not willing to risk blowing the deadline.<br/>A third involved the response to an emergency: Hurricane Sandy. Conservative groups were <br/>AND<br/>the floor, allowing it to pass over the objections of 179 Republicans.<br/>The fourth cave occurred in order to further reform and expand a government program: <br/>AND<br/>weeks later, the House passed the Senate bill with 138 Republicans opposed.<br/>Unfortunately for immigration advocates, there is no prospect of widespread pain if reform isn’t passed. There is no immediate emergency, nor threat of economic collapse.<br/>But there is a deadline of sorts: The 2014 midterm elections.<br/>If we’ve learned anything about Boehner this month, it’s that he’s a party man to the bone. He dragged out the shutdown and debt limit drama for weeks, without gaining a single concession, simply so his most unruly and revolutionary-minded members would believe he fought the good fight and stay in the Republican family. What he won is party unity, at least for the time being.<br/>What Boehner lost for his Republicans is national respectability. Republican Party approval hit a record low in both the most recent NBC/Wall Street Journal poll and Gallup poll.<br/>Here’s where immigration advocates have a window of opportunity to appeal to Boehner’s party pragmatism. Their pitch: The best way to put this disaster behind them is for Republicans to score a big political victory. You need this.<br/>A year after the Republican brand was so bloodied that the Republican National Committee had to commission a formal "autopsy," party approval is the worst it has ever been. You’ve wasted a year. Now is the time to do something that some voters will actually like.<br/>There’s reason to hope he could be swayed. In each of the four cases in which he allowed Democrats to carry the day, he put the short-term political needs of the Republican Party over the ideological demands of right-wing activists.<br/>Boehner will have to do another round of kabuki. He can’t simply swallow the <br/>AND<br/>. Boehner will need to given the room to do all this again.<br/>But he won’t do it without a push. A real good push.</p><p>Immigration reform necessary to sustain the economy and competitiveness<br/>Javier <strong>Palomarez 13</strong>, Forbes, <strong>3/6</strong>/13, The Pent Up Entrepreneurship That Immigration Reform Would Unleash, www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2013/03/06/the-pent-up-entrepreneurship-that-immigration-reform-would-unleash/print/</p><p>The main difference between now and 2007 is that today the role of immigrants and <br/>AND<br/>businesses and workers already know: The American economy needs comprehensive immigration reform.</p><p>Extinction<br/>Auslin 9 <br/>(Michael, Resident Scholar – American Enterprise Institute, and Desmond Lachman – Resident Fellow – American Enterprise Institute, "The Global Economy Unravels", Forbes, 3-6, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.aei.org/article/100187)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.aei.org/article/100187)%27" tppabs="http://www.aei.org/article/100187)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.aei.org/article/100187)</span></a></span></p><p>What do these trends mean in the short and medium term?

The shift could set off a bitter congressional turf war among the leaders of the committees that oversee the military and intelligence community, who already have sparred over the issue.<br/>At issue is a months-long debate about whether the CIA should remain the lead organization for planning and conducting aerial strikes on al-Qaida targets from remotely piloted aircraft.<br/>The Obama administration appears to have settled that debate, opting to hand the military control of most drone strikes while returning the CIA to its core missions of collecting and analyzing intelligence.<br/>In a landmark counterterrorism speech Thursday at National Defense University in Washington, Obama did not directly acknowledge the spy agency has been running the drone-strike program for years. Nor did he formally announce the Defense Department would be handed the lead role in the targeted-killing program.<br/>The president offered some clues into the status of the program, opaquely signaling it will now primarily be conducted by the United States military.<br/>When discussing the thorny issue that is the legality of the drone program, Obama called strikes from remotely piloted aircraft a "military tactic."<br/>"To say a military tactic is legal, or even effective, is not to say it is wise or moral in every instance, for the same progress that gives us the technology to strike half a world away also demands the discipline to constrain that power, or risk abusing it," Obama said.<br/>Minutes later, Obama, while noting drone strikes present unique geopolitical challenges for Washington, again seemed to hint his administration has concluded the military should run the drone-strike effort.<br/>"Now, this is not to say that the risks are not real," Obama said. "Any U.S. military action in foreign lands risks creating more enemies and impacts public opinion overseas."<br/>Military ’Preference’<br/>A senior Obama administration official who briefed reporters before the president’s speech spoke more clearly, announcing the White House indeed has concluded the military soon will take over the lead role for planning and carrying out drone strikes on al-Qaida targets.<br/>"What we do express in the PPG, though, is the preference that the United States military have the lead for the use of force not just in war zones like Afghanistan, but beyond Afghanistan where we are fighting against al-Qaida and its associated forces," the senior administration official said.<br/>The official was referring to a new presidential policy guidance Obama signed this week that adjusts Washington’s counterterrorism approach and includes the drone-program shift.</p><p>This captures their oversight mechanism<br/>Spencer <strong>Ackerman</strong>, Wired national security correspondent, 3/20/<strong>13</strong>, Little Will Change If the Military Takes Over CIA’s Drone Strikes, www.wired.com/dangerroom/2013/03/military-drones/-<span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2013/03/military-drones/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2013/03/military-drones/%27" tppabs="http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2013/03/military-drones/"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2013/03/military-drones/</span></a></span></p><p>The congressional reporting requirements for so-called Title 50 programs (stuff CIA does<br/>AND<br/>operational briefings and allow members of Congress to take tours of drone airbases.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h2 id="H2ncdoboth" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>2nc do both</span></h2><p>The perm is the worst of all worlds—CP alone is individually better<br/><strong>Metzger ’9</strong><br/>Gillian, Professor of Law, Columbia Law School, "THE INTERDEPENDENT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL SEPARATION OF POWERS," 59 Emory L.J. 423</p><p>Equally important, the relationship between internal and external separation of powers is reciprocal: <br/>AND<br/>by the concerns of military lawyers about how the tribunals were functioning. n102</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h2 id="H2ncobjectfiat" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>2nc object fiat</span></h2><p>This is the key academic question<br/><strong>Sinnar</strong>, assistant professor of law at Stanford Law School, May <strong>2013</strong><br/>(Shirin, "Protecting Rights from Within?

Yes, I know that Obamacare is his signature initiative and all that. And I know that if problems persist after Nov. 30, pressure will mount on Harry Reid to let some kind of tinkering legislation be debated. This is a very important three weeks for the administration, and the 30th is an extremely important deadline.<br/>But there’s a certain type of political journalism that so exists in the moment that numerous such moments have been declared to be disasters for Obama, going back to Jeremiah Wright. This kind of hyperventilating approach always turns out to be wrong and overheated. It turned out that all those things were pretty bad, but it also turned out that Obama survived them. And he’ll survive this, too.<br/>What will happen in all likelihood is what usually happens in life and politics—<br/>AND<br/>didn’t, and people will start to get the point about Republican sabotage.<br/>And then, provided health care survives that initial stage without being altered for the worse by Congress, it’s going to start to work. Well.

This is another error much of journalism <br/>AND<br/>complaining, and they’ll be happy to have the opportunity to do so.<br/>Conservatives are desperate for health care to be Obama’s Katrina.

Now, only around 40 percent of Americans think Obama is doing a good job. More than half disapprove of his performance. (A year ago, the numbers were the opposite.)<br/>It seems obvious to say that a high approval rating helps a president, while a low approval rating hurts him. But here are five reasons Obama’s numbers might not be as troublesome as they sound.</p><ol><li>He Was Never Popular With Congress Anyway<br/>A high approval rating can give a president’s initiatives a boost in Congress. "The willingness of members of Congress to take risks," explains Republican strategist Kevin Madden, "is usually proportional to the president’s popularity."<br/>Key word: Usually.<br/>Even when Obama’s popularity neared its high point, the president had a hard time getting bills through Congress. Just after his re-election, with approval ratings above 50 percent, Obama pushed immigration and gun control policies that seemingly had a lot of public support. Neither one became law.<br/>Obama expressed his fury at the gun bill’s failure during an emotional event at the White House Rose Garden, saying, "There were no coherent arguments as to why we wouldn’t do this. It came down to politics."<br/>In other words, Obama has governed like an unpopular president even when he was popular.<br/>At least the guy is consistent, says Ann Selzer, president of the nonpartisan Selzer 26 Co. polling firm in Iowa. "He has problems when his poll numbers are high in terms of getting legislation passed, and problems when his poll numbers are low."<br/>2. Bad Poll Numbers Are Relative<br/>Sure, only around 40 percent of Americans think Obama is doing a good job. But Congress would love to have that kind of approval rating. They’re looking at single digits — and Republicans in Congress are doing even worse.<br/>That makes some Democrats optimistic about their party’s chances in 2014, even though the party of the president typically loses seats in a midterm.<br/>"Independent voters more than anybody are really fed up with the Republicans," says Democratic strategist Mary Anne Marsh. "For the first time in I think modern history, you have polls out there showing that almost 65 percent of voters want to get rid of their member of Congress. That has never been the case," she says.<br/>She’s referring to an from last month showing widespread damage to the GOP from the government shutdown.<br/>Rutgers University political scientist Ross Baker says disapproval of Congress casts Obama’s position in a different light.<br/>"Usually you have a situation in which the president is up and Congress is down, or the president is down and Congress is up," says Baker. "People liken it to a seesaw. But, in a sense, what we have now is a kind of rubber seesaw in which both sides are down."<br/>Says pollster Selzer: "In a relative world where people are feeling that Washington’s not moving, getting things done, or passing legislation, there’s a sense that Obama is actually really surviving with the rosiest scenario."<br/>3. There’s Not Much Purple On The Congressional Map<br/>In the midterm elections, Obama’s approval rating can only really tilt the outcome in purple, or highly competitive, congressional districts. And there are fewer of those than ever before. Redistricting has wiped out swing districts in favor of safe zones for Republicans and Democrats.<br/>"Majorities are built in Congress based on a much smaller universe of swing districts," says Republican Madden. "But in those swing districts, it’s the president’s popularity that usually makes the difference between whether a Democrat can win or a Democrat will lose."<br/>Political scientist Baker says winning the 17 seats necessary to regain control of the House from Republicans "has always been an uphill prospect for the Democrats," no matter what the president’s approval rating might be.<br/>Still, this week’s gubernatorial election in Virginia showed that Obama could be a drag on Democratic candidates in purple areas. Terry McAuliffe was forecast to carry the state by double digits. Instead, he won by a much smaller margin.<br/>4. It’s A Pretty Narrow Swing<br/>Although Obama is at a low point now, his approval rating hasn’t really varied all that much. After his initial election spike in 2008, his favorability numbers have settled into a band between the low 50s to around 40 percent. Not great, but not really terrible either — especially compared with his predecessor.</li></ol><p>Obama’s solution solved<br/>Brian <strong>Beutler</strong>, Salon, <strong>11/14</strong>/13, &nbsp;The president strikes back: Insurance companies get their justified comeuppance , www.salon.com/2013/11/14/the_president_strikes_back_insurance_companies_get_their_justified_comeuppance/</p><p>If your health insurance carrier has canceled your plan in anticipation of the launch of <br/>AND<br/>fixed.

It has since gone through multiple iterations.<br/>The initial concept followed on the federal full-scale Top Official ("TopOff") exercises, used to train government officials to respond to domestic crises.165 It adapted a Tabletop Exercise, designed with the help of exercise officials at DHS and FEMA, to the law school environment. The Tabletop used one storyline to push on specific legal questions, as students, assigned roles in the discussion, sat around a table and for six hours engaged with the material.<br/>The problem with the Tabletop Exercise was that it was too static, and the <br/>AND<br/>focused on specific legal issues, even as it controlled for external chaos.<br/>The opportunity to provide a more full experience for the students came with the creation of first a one-day, and then a multi-day simulation. The course design and simulation continues to evolve. It offers a model for achieving the pedagogical goals outlined above, in the process developing a rigorous training ground for the next generation of national security lawyers.166<br/>A. Course Design<br/>The central idea in structuring the NSL Sim 2.0 course was to bridge <br/>AND<br/>and legal education) and flexible (responsive to student input and decisionmaking).<br/>Perhaps the most significant weakness in the use of any constructed universe is the problem <br/>AND<br/>student decisions themselves must drive the evolution of events within the simulation.168<br/>Additionally, while authenticity matters, it is worth noting that at some level the <br/>AND<br/>that would be much more difficult to do in a regular practice setting.<br/>NSL Sim 2.0 takes as its starting point the national security pedagogical goals discussed above. It works backwards to then engineer a classroom, cyber, and physical/simulation experience to delve into each of these areas. As a substantive matter, the course focuses on the constitutional, statutory, and regulatory authorities in national security law, placing particular focus on the interstices between black letter law and areas where the field is either unsettled or in flux.<br/>A key aspect of the course design is that it retains both the doctrinal and <br/>AND<br/>giving students the opportunity to develop depth and breadth prior to the exercise.<br/>In order to capture problems related to adaptation and evolution, addressing goal ~1<br/>AND<br/>Law to build the cyber portal used for NSL Sim 2.0.<br/>The twin goals of adaptation and evolution require that students be given a significant amount <br/>AND<br/>execution of the play, further developing their understanding of national security law.<br/>Throughout the simulation, the Control Team is constantly reacting to student choices. When unexpected decisions are made, professors may choose to pursue the evolution of the story to accomplish the pedagogical aims, or they may choose to cut off play in that area (there are various devices for doing so, such as denying requests, sending materials to labs to be analyzed, drawing the players back into the main storylines, and leaking information to the media).<br/>A total immersion simulation involves a number of scenarios, as well as systemic noise<br/>AND<br/>but to embrace them as part of the challenge facing national security lawyers.<br/>The simulation itself is problem-based, giving players agency in driving the evolution <br/>AND<br/>, generating in turn a set of new issues that must be addressed.<br/>The written and oral components of the simulation conform to the fourth pedagogical goal – <br/>AND<br/>simulation – and to deliver a 90 second oral briefing after the session.<br/>To replicate the high-stakes political environment at issue in goals (1) <br/>AND<br/>many different considerations that decisionmakers take into account in the national security domain.<br/>Scenarios are selected with high consequence events in mind, to ensure that students recognize <br/>AND<br/>to emphasize the broader political context within which national security law is practiced.<br/>Both anticipated and unanticipated decisions give rise to ethical questions and matters related to the <br/>AND<br/>exercise itself hitting the aim of the integration of the various pedagogical goals.<br/>Finally, there are multiple layers of feedback that players receive prior to, during<br/>AND<br/>, while another Control Team member may reject a FISC application as insufficient.<br/>The simulation goes beyond this, however, focusing on teaching students how to develop <br/>AND<br/>uncertainty, tension with colleagues, mistakes, and successes in the future.<br/>B. Substantive Areas: Interstices and Threats<br/>As a substantive matter, NSL Sim 2.0 is designed to take account <br/>AND<br/>weapons and pandemic disease also come within the doctrinal part of the course.<br/>The simulation itself is based on five to six storylines reflecting the interstices between different areas of the law. The storylines are used to present a coherent, non-linear scenario that can adapt to student responses. Each scenario is mapped out in a three to seven page document, which is then checked with scientists, government officials, and area experts for consistency with how the scenario would likely unfold in real life.<br/>For the biological weapons and pandemic disease emphasis, for example, one narrative might <br/>AND<br/>through press releases, weather updates, private communications, and the like.<br/>The five to six storylines, prepared by the Control Team in consultation with experts<br/>AND<br/>, giving the Control Team a birds-eye view of the progression.<br/>C. How It Works<br/>As for the nuts and bolts of the simulation itself, it traditionally begins outside of class, in the evening, on the grounds that national security crises often occur at inconvenient times and may well involve limited sleep and competing demands.171 Typically, a phone call from a Control Team member posing in a role integral to one of the main storylines, initiates play.<br/>Students at this point have been assigned dedicated simulation email addresses and provided access to <br/>AND<br/>relevant student teams. The Control Team has access to the complete site.<br/>For the next two (or three) days, outside of student initiatives (<br/>AND<br/>, or technology concerns, while setting the stage for the breaking crisis.<br/>The third (or fourth) day of play takes place entirely at Georgetown Law<br/>AND<br/>releases. Students use their own laptop computers for team decisions and communication.<br/>As the storylines unfold, the Control Team takes on a variety of roles, <br/>AND<br/>the simulation unfolded, and how the students performed in their various capacities.<br/>At the end of the day, the exercise terminates and an immediate hotwash is held, in which players are first debriefed on what occurred during the simulation. Because of the players’ divergent experiences and the different roles assigned to them, the students at this point are often unaware of the complete picture. The judges and formal observers then offer reflections on the simulation and determine which teams performed most effectively.<br/>Over the next few classes, more details about the simulation emerge, as students <br/>AND<br/>opportunities for learning in the future. The course then formally ends.172 <br/>Learning, however, continues beyond the temporal confines of the semester. Students who <br/>AND<br/>concerns. And it builds a strong community of individuals with common interests.<br/>CONCLUSION<br/>The legal academy has, of late, been swept up in concern about the <br/>AND<br/>both the expression of government authority and the effort to limit the same.<br/>The one-size fits all approach currently dominating the conversation in legal education, <br/>AND<br/>greater nuance in the discussion of the adequacy of the current pedagogical approach.<br/>With this approach in mind, I have here suggested six pedagogical goals for national <br/>AND<br/>to ensure that they will be most effective when they enter the field.<br/>The problem with the current structures in legal education is that they fall short, <br/>AND<br/>in other areas of experiential education, such as clinics and moot court.<br/>It is in an effort to address these concerns that I developed the simulation model <br/>AND<br/>undoubtedly necessary, it suggests one potential direction for the years to come.</p><p>Debate over a controversial point of action creates argumentative stasis—that’s key to avoid a devolution of debate into competing truth claims, which destroys the decision-making benefits of the activity<br/><strong>Steinberg and Freeley ’13</strong><br/>David Director of Debate at U Miami, Former President of CEDA, officer, American Forensic Association and National Communication Association.

RESTORING CRITICAL OPTIMISM IN THE LEGAL FIELD<br/>"La critique est aisée; l’art difficile." <br/>A critique of cooptation often takes an uneasy path. Critique has always been and <br/>AND<br/>as transformative while assuming that a conservative tilt exists in formal legal paths. <br/>In the triangular conundrum of "law and social change," law is regularly the <br/>AND<br/>constantly redefining the boundaries of legal reform and making visible law’s broad reach.&nbsp;</p><p> &nbsp;<br/>The process of inculcating critical thinking is more transformative than their ~demand / ethical stance~<br/>Catherine <strong>Fox</strong>, teaches writing at Iowa State University. Her research interests focus on feminist and critical pedagogies, critical race theory, and feminist rhetorics, 200<strong>2</strong>, The Race to Truth: Disarticulating Critical Thinking from Whiteliness, Pedagogy 2.2 (2002) 197-212</p><p>We also tend to acknowledge critical thinking only as an analytic form of thought that <br/>AND<br/>example, Shor (1992: 41) presents critical thinking as follows:<br/>Had I tried to be a "neutral" teacher who ignored the pro-<br/>AND<br/>see one structure in society for what it really is ~emphasis mine~. <br/>I agree that no classroom is "neutral," and I do not deny the <br/>AND<br/>, however "revolutionary," is "still running in old cycles." 3<br/>In sum, I perceive the following problems with the way that feminist and critical pedagogues posit critical thinking:</p><ol><li>In general, we consider it an unquestionable good, and as such it operates as a god-term.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;2. We equate it with analytic thinking that leads students to see issues in the "right" way.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Thus we tend to conflate critical thinking with feminist and critical ideologies.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Ultimately, doing so creates a race to truth whose telos is the same as that of the traditional pedagogies criticized for using transmission models of language, knowledge, and learning. <br/>Critical Thinking: Racing to Truth<br/>One way to disarticulate this conflation is through the metaphor of whiteliness. Ruth Frankenberg <br/>AND<br/>"transparent" are also important steps toward disrupting systems of domination. 4<br/>In "Identity: Skin Blood Heart," in which she explores her struggles against <br/>AND<br/>whitely, all of which pertain primarily to Pratt’s characteristic of judge: 6<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;I was taught that because one knows what is right, it is morally appropriate to have and exercise what I now would call race and class privilege. <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Whitely people have a staggering faith in their own rightness and goodness, and that of other whitely people. We are not crooks. <br/>Whitely people do have a sense of right and wrong, and are ethical. Their ethics is in a great part an ethics of forms, procedures and due process. <br/>Whitely people tend to believe that one preserves one’s goodness by being principled, by acting according to rules instead of according to feeling. <br/>Authority seems to be central to whiteliness, as you might expect from a people who are raised to run things, or to aspire to that: belief in one’s authority in matters practical, moral and intellectual exists in tension with the insecurity and hypocrisy that are essentially connected with the pretense of infallibility. (153-54) <br/>Turning next to white women’s whiteliness, Frye argues that it is based on integrity, dignity, and respectability, which whitely women use as levers to raise themselves to the level of whitely men. She calls on white women to unlearn whiteliness, just as men are expected to unlearn masculinity, if the ultimate goal is to achieve more egalitarian relationships with others.<br/>The judgmentalism of whitely people and the presumed rightness that protects them from having to <br/>AND<br/>I seductively named what I did "teaching my students to think critically."<br/>One’s positioning as a feminist or critical pedagogue, then, rests on the assumption <br/>AND<br/>discovered, we manifest and reproduce whitely ways of being in the world.<br/>Thus critical thinking becomes a lever, similar to the integrity, dignity, and <br/>AND<br/>, marginalized truth—it is only more "running in old cycles."<br/>The parallels between theories of whiteliness and the uses of critical thinking in alternative pedagogies <br/>AND<br/>, we can begin to transform them into new ways of being. 9<br/>Disarticulating Critical Thinking from Whiteliness<br/>Critical thinking, when disarticulated from a particular ideological standpoint, offers us a means <br/>AND<br/>make them, not what suggests the relative correctness of choices and locations.<br/>Two concepts from Paulo Freire indicate an approach to critical thinking that supersedes the revolutionary <br/>AND<br/>extent to which our positions already carry whitely notions of rightness and righteousness.<br/>Imagination and humility seem to go underground when we collapse critical thinking with feminist and <br/>AND<br/>meaning and knowledge with our students, rather than transmit knowledge to them.<br/>The first-year composition course I teach at Iowa State University, a predominantly <br/>AND<br/>, or writing a letter to the editor or to a congressional representative.<br/>Toward the end of the project, we discuss the consequences of the options we <br/>AND<br/>difference do my choices make?

First<br/>AND<br/>I attempted to model explicitly the critical engagement central to my course curriculum.<br/>I realize that I am placing a tall order for feminist and critical educators to fill in one semester or one quarter. Nonetheless, I believe that it will allow us actually to engage in processes of critical thinking alongside our students. In Freire’s (1996: 3) words, we need to be "rigorously coherent so as to not lose ~ourselves~ in the enormous distance between what ~we~ do and say."<br/>My point is not that we should rid our classrooms of truths or ideologies. <br/>AND<br/>at solutions, question the consequences, and return again to making meaning.</li></ol><p>That proves that process comes before product—inscribing a set ethical outcome at the outset destroys agency<br/><strong>Race and Pedagogy Project</strong>, University of California at Santa Barbara, 200<strong>5</strong>, Jay, Gregory and Gerald Graff.

That is what is totalizing about totalitarianism (Arendt, 1950). <br/>Authority, on the contrary, is always given, or it is fraudulent (Rieff, 1985). Authority is given not because people are dupes, tricked into controlling themselves for some systemic conspiracy, but because through the hierarchical ordering of culture they find their way to purposeful behaviour (Durkheim, ~1925~ 1973) and a feeling of self-respect that makes life meaningful and worthwhile (Cooley, 1922; Rieff, 1985; Sullivan, 1950). <br/>Authority, then, is essential to culture.

First, Cooper’s belief <br/>AND<br/>, making it impossible to evaluate the logic and coherence of the argument. <br/>Second, Cooper’s view that the will to organize originates in an inherent ambivalence in language is reductionistic. Clearly, as Gellner (1979) states, social reality is complex and there are many factors that lead to organizational activities. Postmodernism’s reification of language ignores, for example, the influences of economic scarcity, geographical conditions, and demographic influences. Even some animal groups organize for hunting and/or safety. Certainly they are not motivated by existential ambivalences in language. <br/>Third, Stephen Linstead does not ask the question why semantic closure is needed as <br/>AND<br/>the presumption of a world of openness cannot be a world at all. <br/>Fourth, Cooper’s characterization of cultural authority as a ’violent hierarchy’ is obviously a condemnation <br/>AND<br/>to destructive levels of envy and self-interest (Hirschhorn, 1993).&nbsp;</p><p>Causes mass violence<br/>Feldman, Assoc Prof Management Policy – Case Western U, ’98<br/>(Steven P, "Playing with the Pieces: Deconstruction and the Loss of Moral Culture," Journal of Management Studies Vol. 35 Iss. 1, p. 59-79)&nbsp;</p><p>Nothingness, or the ’search for instabilities’ advocated by postmodern writers leads to a dangerous <br/>AND<br/>needs with collective requirements that I find most dangerous in the postmodern literature.</p><p>And, ensures cooptation <br/>Feldman, Assoc Prof Management Policy – Case Western U, ’98<br/>(Steven P, "Playing with the Pieces: Deconstruction and the Loss of Moral Culture," Journal of Management Studies Vol. 35 Iss. 1, p. 59-79)&nbsp;</p><p>Pluralization, or self-centredness, can be a problem too, however. <br/>AND<br/>at decentralization that will break down civility or be reversed through corporate manipulation.&nbsp;</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h2 id="H2ncat:lawbad" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>2nc at: law bad</span></h2><p>Simulating government action on foreign policy enables understanding and empathy—critical to effective activism<br/>Esberg, special assistant to the director – Center on International Cooperation @ NYU, and Sagan, professor of political science – Stanford University, ’12<br/>(Jane and Scott, "NEGOTIATING NONPROLIFERATION: Scholarship, Pedagogy, and Nuclear Weapons Policy," The Nonproliferation Review, Vol. 19, Issue 1, p. 95-108)</p><p>In Charles Dickens’s novel Hard Times, Mr. Gradgrind—the headmaster of a <br/>AND<br/>especially leaders in other countries, act as they do in international politics.<br/>In the field of nonproliferation studies, students are taught facts about which states acquired <br/>AND<br/>empathy and imagination can be developed through the use of simulation in teaching.<br/>Simulations are particularly suited to the teaching of nuclear nonproliferation because the "facts" <br/>AND<br/>understand why some states develop nuclear weapons and other states do not.4<br/>Although arms control and nonproliferation simulations have been used inside governments and at many universities<br/>AND<br/>) with different national and institutional perspectives on nuclear weapons and foreign policy.<br/>This article both examines the role of simulation in teaching about nuclear proliferation and nonproliferation <br/>AND<br/>that improve our understanding of real-world nuclear negotiation dynamics and outcomes.<br/>The Use of Exercises and Simulations<br/>Governments have long used simulations and war game exercises to anticipate the behavior of other <br/>AND<br/>-scale military exercises involving actual armed forces or domestic homeland security organizations.<br/>These government or quasi-government think tank simulations often provide very similar lessons for <br/>AND<br/>allies and adversaries, would behave in response to US policy initiatives.7<br/>By university age, students often have a pre-defined view of international affairs<br/>AND<br/>quickly; simulations teach students how to contextualize and act on information.14</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h2 id="Hat:creativity" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>at: creativity</span></h2><p>Constraints make creativity possible—eliminating rules makes their form of opposition to structure meaningless<br/>Armstrong 2000<br/>Paul B.

Now, they’re bringing their party together and shining a white hot light on Republican disunity over whether to shut down the government and plunge the nation into default in a vain effort to stop Obamacare from going into effect.<br/>The squabbling among Republicans has gotten so vicious that a Twitter hashtag — ~23GOPvsGOPugliness — has become a thick virtual data file for tracking the intraparty insults. Moderates, and even some conservatives, are slamming Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, a tea party favorite, for ramping up grassroots expectations that the GOP will shut down the government if it can’t win concessions from the president to "defund" his signature health care law.<br/>"I didn’t go to Harvard or Princeton, but I can count," Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) tweeted, subtly mocking Cruz’s Ivy League education. "The defunding box canyon is a tactic that will fail and weaken our position."<br/>While it is well-timed for the White House to interrupt a bad slide, Obama’s singular focus on the budget battle is hardly a last-minute shift. Instead, it is a return to the narrative arc that the White House was working to build before the Syria crisis intervened.<br/>And it’s so important to the president’s strategy that White House officials didn’t consider postponing Monday’s rollout of the most partisan and high-stakes phase even when a shooter murdered a dozen people at Washington’s Navy Yard that morning.<br/>The basic storyline, well under way over the summer, was to have the <br/>AND<br/>leverage a debt-ceiling increase for Obamacare cuts would reverse progress made.<br/>The president is on firm ground, White House officials say, because he stands with the public in believing that the government shouldn’t shut down and that the country should pay its bills.</p><p>The plan causes an inter-branch fight that derails Obama’s agenda<br/>Douglas <strong>Kriner</strong>, Assistant Profess of Political Science at Boston University, 20<strong>10</strong>, After the Rubicon: Congress, Presidents, and the Politics of Waging War, p. 67-69</p><p>Raising or Lowering Political Costs by Affecting Presidential Political Capital<br/>Shaping both real and anticipated public opinion are two important ways in which Congress can <br/>AND<br/>were more important to the president than achieving unconditional victory over North Korea."<br/>While congressional support leaves the president’s reserve of political capital intact, congressional criticism saps <br/>AND<br/>that had suffered the highest casualty rates in the Iraq War.6°<br/>In addition to boding ill for the president’s perceived political capital and reputation, such <br/>AND<br/>a rear-guard action against congressional critics of the war in Iraq.<br/>When making their cost-benefit calculations, presidents surely consider these wider political costs of congressional opposition to their military policies.

Pa. L. Rev. 1165</p><p>4. Procedural Requirements<br/>Currently, officials in the executive branch carry out all such ex ante review of <br/>AND<br/>there is no equivalent effort in areas outside the active conflict zone. n164<br/>Meanwhile, the degree of ex post review of detention decisions depends on the location of detention as opposed to the location of capture. Thus, &nbsp;~*1219~ &nbsp;Guantanamo detainees are entitled to habeas review, but detainees held in Afghanistan are not, even if they were captured far away and brought to Afghanistan to be detained. n165<br/>Enhanced ex ante and ex post procedural protections for both detention and targeting, coupled with transparency as to the standards and processes employed, serve several important functions: they can minimize error and abuse by creating time for advance reflection, correct erroneous deprivations of liberty, create endogenous incentives to avoid mistake or abuse, and increase the legitimacy of state action.<br/>a. Ex Ante Procedures<br/>Three key considerations should guide the development of ex ante procedures. First, any <br/>AND<br/>employed must be transparent and sufficiently credible to achieve the desired legitimacy gains.<br/>These considerations suggest the value of an independent, formalized, ex ante review system. Possible models include the Foreign Intelligence &nbsp;~*1220~ &nbsp;Surveillance Court (FISC), n168 or a FISC-like entity composed of military and intelligence officials and military lawyers, in the mode of an executive branch review board. n169<br/>Created by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) in 1978, n170 the <br/>AND<br/>an unauthorized disclosure of an application to or order from the FISC court.<br/>An ex parte review system for targeting and detention outside zones of active hostility could <br/>AND<br/>would leave target identification and time-sensitive decisionmaking to the operators. n174<br/>Moreover, there should be a mechanism for emergency authorizations at the behest of the <br/>AND<br/>place) as soon as practicable but at most within seven days. n176<br/>Finally, and critically, given the stakes in any application namely, the deprivation of life someone should be appointed to represent the potential target’s interests and put together the most compelling case that the individual is not who he is assumed to be or does not meet the targeting criteria.<br/>The objections to such a proposal are many. In the context of proposed courts <br/>AND<br/>to avoid ad hoc decisionmaking and will ensure consistency across administrations and time.<br/>Some also condemn the ex parte nature of such reviews. n179 But again, <br/>AND<br/>which an official is obligated to act as advocate for the potential target.<br/>That said, there is a reasonable fear that any such court or review board <br/>AND<br/>those features in and of themselves can lead to increased reflection and restraint.<br/>Additional accountability mechanisms, such as civil or criminal sanctions in the event of material misrepresentations or omissions, the granting of far-reaching authority to the relevant Inspectors General, and meaningful ex post review by Article III courts, n182 are also needed to help further minimize abuse.<br/>Conversely, some object to the use of courts or court-like review as <br/>AND<br/>Article III-FISC model, further addresses some of the constitutional concerns.<br/>Some also have warned that there may be no "case or controversy" for <br/>AND<br/>would be issuing a warrant for the most extreme type of seizure. n189<br/>It is also important to emphasize that a reviewing court or review board would not <br/>AND<br/>available to deal with exceptional cases where ex ante approval is not possible.<br/>Additional details will need to be addressed, including the temporal limits of the court’s <br/>AND<br/>the threat, consistent with what courts regularly do when they issue warrants.<br/>In the absence of such a system, the President ought to, at a <br/>AND<br/>Given the stakes, a clear and convincing evidentiary standard is warranted. n195<br/>While this proposal is obviously geared toward the United States, the same principles should apply for all states engaged in targeting operations. n196 States would ideally subject such determinations to independent review or, alternatively, clearly articulate the standards and procedures for their decisionmaking, thus enhancing accountability.<br/>b. Ex Post Review<br/>For targeted-killing operations, ex post reviews serve only limited purposes. They <br/>AND<br/>against rash ex ante decisionmaking, thereby providing a self-correcting mechanism.<br/>Ex post review should also be accompanied by the establishment of a solatia and condolence payment system for activities that occur outside the active zone of hostilities. Extension of such a system beyond Afghanistan and Iraq would help mitigate resentment caused by civilian deaths or injuries and would promote better accounting of the civilian costs of targeting operations. n198</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h2 id="HDA-5" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>DA</span></h2><p>Executive war power primacy now—the plan flips that<br/>Eric <strong>Posner</strong>, 9/3/<strong>13</strong>, Obama Is Only Making His War Powers Mightier, www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/view_from_chicago/2013/09/obama_going_to_congress_on_syria_he_s_actually_strengthening_the_war_powers.html</p><p>President Obama’s surprise announcement that he will ask Congress for approval of a military attack <br/>AND<br/>and avoid it when he knows that it will stand in his way.</p><p>The squo gives the president necessarily flexibility that the plan eviscerates<br/>John <strong>Bennett</strong>, Defense News, <strong>5/24</strong>/13, White House Quietly Shifts Armed Drone Program from CIA to DoD, www.defensenews.com/article/20130524/DEFREG02/305240010/White-House-Quietly-Shifts-Armed-Drone-Program-from-CIA-DoD</p><p>That official, however — by calling it "a preference" that the military take the lead role — provided important wiggle room and signaled the CIA is not out of the targeted-killing business for good.<br/>To that end, a former senior CIA official told Defense News earlier this week following a not-for-attribution event in Washington that Obama and his senior national security advisers have wanted for some time to return the CIA to its core missions.<br/>"Do you want the nation’s top espionage agency conducting a paramilitary mission or performing espionage?" the former senior official asked rhetorically.

It is hard to think of something less suitable for a federal judge to rule on than the fast-moving and protean nature of targeting decisions.<br/>Fortunately, a better solution exists: a "national security court" housed within the executive branch itself. Experts, not generalists, would rule; pressing concerns about classified information would be minimized; and speedy decisions would be easier to reach.<br/>There is, of course, a role for federal courts in national security. In 2006, I argued and won Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, a Supreme Court case that struck down President George W. Bush’s use of military tribunals at Guantánamo Bay. But military trials are a far cry from wartime targeting decisions.<br/>And the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which reviews administration requests to collect intelligence involving foreign agents inside the country and which some have advocated as a model for the drone court, is likewise appropriately housed within the judicial system — it rules on surveillance operations that raise questions much like those in Fourth Amendment "search and seizure" cases, a subject federal judges know well.<br/>But there is no true precedent for interposing courts into military decisions about who, what and when to strike militarily. Putting aside the serious constitutional implications of such a proposal, courts are simply not institutionally equipped to play such a role.<br/>There are many reasons a drone court composed of generalist federal judges will not work. They lack national security expertise, they are not accustomed to ruling on lightning-fast timetables, they are used to being in absolute control, their primary work is on domestic matters and they usually rule on matters after the fact, not beforehand.<br/>Even the questions placed before the FISA Court aren’t comparable to what a drone court would face; they involve more traditional constitutional issues — not rapidly developing questions about whether to target an individual for assassination by a drone strike.<br/>Imagine instead that the president had an internal court, staffed by expert lawyers to represent both sides. Those lawyers, like the Judge Advocate General’s Corps in the military, would switch sides every few years, to develop both expertise as repeat players and the ability to understand the other point of view.<br/>The adjudicator would be a panel of the president’s most senior national security advisers, who would issue decisions in writing if at all possible. Those decisions would later be given to the Congressional intelligence committees for review. Crucially, the president would be able to overrule this court, and take whatever action he thought appropriate, but would have to explain himself afterward to Congress.<br/>Such a court would embed accountability and expertise into the drone program. With a federal drone court, it would simply be too easy for a president or other executive-branch official to point his finger at a federal judge for the failure to act. With an internal court, it would be impossible to avoid blame.<br/>It’s true that a court housed within the executive branch might sound nefarious in today’s "Homeland" culture — if Alexander Hamilton celebrated the executive, in Federalist No. 70, for its "decision, activity, secrecy and dispatch," some now look at those same qualities with skepticism, if not fear.<br/>In contrast, advocates of a drone court say it would bring independent, constitutional values of reasoned decision making to a process that is inherently murky.<br/>But simply placing a drone court in the judicial branch is not a guaranteed check<br/>AND<br/>think that judges are better than specialists at keeping executive power in check?<br/>The written decisions of an internal national security court, in contrast, would be products of an adversarial system (unlike the FISA Court), and later reviewed by Congressional intelligence committees. If members of Congress saw troublesome trends developing, it could push legislation to constrain the executive. That is something a federal judge cannot do.<br/>One of our Constitution’s greatest virtues is that it looks to judges as a source of reasoned, practical, rights-minded decision making. But judges should be left to what they know. A national security court inside the executive branch may not be a perfect solution, but it is a better way to balance the demands of secrecy and speed with those of liberty and justice.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h2 id="HDA2" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>DA 2</span></h2><p>Plan shifts the balance of war powers—kills war fighting. <br/><strong>Epps 13</strong> (Garrett, law prof at the University of Baltimore, The Atlantic, "Why a Secret Court Won’t Solve the Drone-Strike Problem", Feb 16, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/02/why-a-secret-court-wont-solve-the-drone-strike-problem/273246/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/02/why-a-secret-court-wont-solve-the-drone-strike-problem/273246/%27" tppabs="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/02/why-a-secret-court-wont-solve-the-drone-strike-problem/273246/"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/02/why-a-secret-court-wont-solve-the-drone-strike-problem/273246/</span></a></span>, ZBurdette)</p><p>Look up: that buzz you hear overhead is the "drone court."<br/>Washington’s idea of the week is a secret court, based on the Foreign Intelligence <br/>AND<br/>a certification that lethal force can be used against the "enemy combatant."<br/>Sen. Dianne Feinstein spoke favorably about the idea at confirmation hearings for C.I.A. Director-designate John Brennan. So did former Defense Secretary Robert Gates. Thursday, the New York Times joined in the chorus. <br/>Americans love courts and judges. But they trust them because, in our system<br/>AND<br/>particularly, they may not become an advisory agency of the executive branch.<br/>The idea of a "drone court" would send federal courts into areas they have never gone before, and indeed from which, I think, the text of the Constitution bars them. It could also put the integrity of our court system at risk.<br/>Let’s frame the issue properly. The present administration does not claim that the president <br/>AND<br/>international terrorism against the United States by such nations, organizations or persons." <br/>Unlike the fictional President Bennett in Tom Clancy’s Clear and Present Danger, then, President Obama can’t suddenly send the drone fleet down to take out, say, Colombian drug lords or the Lord’s Resistance Army in Uganda. That’s a marked change from the overall position of the last administration, and it’s an important limitation on the president’s claimed authority.<br/>But because of that limitation, a court would be supervising the president’s command decisions <br/>AND<br/>or a SEAL Team. Courts simply aren’t equipped to decide military tactics.<br/>The FISA Court, on the other hand, doesn’t really reach beyond Article III—judges since ancient times have issued warrants for searches and arrests, and the individuals being spied on are suspected of crimes against the United States. But I don’t know of a deep-rooted tradition of common-law courts telling the shire reeve he can hunt someone down and kill him without trial.<br/>There’s yet another problem: what criteria would a "drone court" apply? <br/>AND<br/>, and created a panel of poorly trained generals in sloppy black uniforms.<br/>Finally, in time of war, there will be occasions when a target emerges and decisions must be made too quickly for even a secret court proceeding. And thus the "drone court" would not be able to rule on some cases; an ambitious president could find many exceptions.</p><p>It spills over to destabilize all war powers. <br/><strong>Heder ’10</strong> <br/>(Adam, J.D., magna cum laude , J.

They include repealing the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans; providing Hurricane Sandy relief; expanding the Violence Against Women act to better cover immigrants, Native Americans, and LGBT survivors of abuse; and this week’s bill raising the debt limit and reopening the federal government.<br/>Many presume the Republican House is a black hole sucking President Obama’s second-term agenda into oblivion. But the list of Boehner’s past retreats offers a glimmer of hope, especially to advocates of immigration reform. Though it has languished in the House, an immigration overhaul passed with bipartisan support in the Senate, and was given a fresh push by Obama in the aftermath of the debt limit deal.<br/>The big mystery that immigration advocates need to figure out: What makes Boehner cave? Is there a common thread? Is there a sequence of buttons you can push that forces Boehner to relent?<br/>Two of this year’s caves happened when Boehner was backed up against hard deadlines: <br/>AND<br/>both times, but he was not willing to risk blowing the deadline.<br/>A third involved the response to an emergency: Hurricane Sandy. Conservative groups were <br/>AND<br/>the floor, allowing it to pass over the objections of 179 Republicans.<br/>The fourth cave occurred in order to further reform and expand a government program: <br/>AND<br/>weeks later, the House passed the Senate bill with 138 Republicans opposed.<br/>Unfortunately for immigration advocates, there is no prospect of widespread pain if reform isn’t passed. There is no immediate emergency, nor threat of economic collapse.<br/>But there is a deadline of sorts: The 2014 midterm elections.<br/>If we’ve learned anything about Boehner this month, it’s that he’s a party man to the bone. He dragged out the shutdown and debt limit drama for weeks, without gaining a single concession, simply so his most unruly and revolutionary-minded members would believe he fought the good fight and stay in the Republican family. What he won is party unity, at least for the time being.<br/>What Boehner lost for his Republicans is national respectability. Republican Party approval hit a record low in both the most recent NBC/Wall Street Journal poll and Gallup poll.<br/>Here’s where immigration advocates have a window of opportunity to appeal to Boehner’s party pragmatism. Their pitch: The best way to put this disaster behind them is for Republicans to score a big political victory. You need this.<br/>A year after the Republican brand was so bloodied that the Republican National Committee had to commission a formal "autopsy," party approval is the worst it has ever been. You’ve wasted a year. Now is the time to do something that some voters will actually like.<br/>There’s reason to hope he could be swayed. In each of the four cases in which he allowed Democrats to carry the day, he put the short-term political needs of the Republican Party over the ideological demands of right-wing activists.<br/>Boehner will have to do another round of kabuki. He can’t simply swallow the <br/>AND<br/>. Boehner will need to given the room to do all this again.<br/>But he won’t do it without a push.

Tetlock et al argue that there are many other factors between the decision process and the outcome. The outcome of any decision-making process, they argue, will only have a certain probability of success due to various environmental factors (such as luck).<br/>A large-scale study researching decision-making in seven major American corporations concluded that decision-making worked best when following a sound information processing method; however these groups also showed signs of groupthink, in that they had strong leadership which attempted to persuade others in the group that they were right (Peterson et al, 1998, cited in Sunstein, 2003).<br/>Esser (1998) found that groupthink characteristics were correlated with failures; however cohesiveness did not appear to be a factor: groups consisting of strangers, friends, or various levels of previous experience together did not appear to effect decision-making ability. Janis’ claims of insulation of groups and groups led by autocratic leaders did show that these attributes were indicative of groupthink symptoms.<br/>Moorhead 26 Montanari conducted a study where they concluded that groupthink symptoms had no significant effect on group performance, and that "the relationship between groupthink-induced decision defects and outcomes were not as strong as Janis suggests" (Moorhead 26 Montanari, 1986, p. 399; cited by Choi 26 Kim, 1999).<br/>Overall, the groupthink hypothesis appears to be valuable as a descriptive, analytic and <br/>AND<br/>that can help illuminate the inexact spheres of organizational behaviour and communications theory.&nbsp;</p><p>Their backlash link is about drone strikes, not all drone tech – no current strikes against AQIM – their card:<br/><strong>Zenko</strong>, CFR Center for Preventive Action Douglas Dillon fellow, <strong>2013</strong><br/>(Micah, Council Special Report No. 65, January 2013, "Reforming U.S. Drone Strike Policies," <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.cfr.org/wars-and-warfare/reforming-us-drone-strike-policies/p29736?co=C009601)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.cfr.org/wars-and-warfare/reforming-us-drone-strike-policies/p29736?co=C009601)%27" tppabs="http://www.cfr.org/wars-and-warfare/reforming-us-drone-strike-policies/p29736?co=C009601)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.cfr.org/wars-and-warfare/reforming-us-drone-strike-policies/p29736?co=C009601)</span></a></span></p><p>In his Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech, President Obama declared: "Where force <br/>AND<br/>likelihood of civilian casualties since the total number of strikes would significantly decrease).<br/>The choice the United States faces is not between unfettered drone use and sacrificing freedom <br/>AND<br/>terrorist attacks, unprecedented domestic political pressure led to significant reforms or termination.<br/>22<br/>Recommendations 23<br/>Compared to Bush-era counterterrorism policies, drone strikes are vulnerable to similar—<br/>AND<br/>percent), Japan (75 percent), and Pakistan (83 percent).67<br/>This is significant because the United States cannot conduct drone strikes in the most critical <br/>AND<br/>the human intelligence networks on the ground that are critical for identifying targets.<br/>According to U.S. diplomats and military officials, active resis- tance—such as the Pakistani army shooting down U.S. armed drones— is a legitimate concern.

How close are we to an accord?<br/>My impression is that we are close. Several individuals involved in the talks that I’ve spoken to over the weekend said that they are optimistic, that we’re not far from an agreement, that there are still a couple of important questions that need to be settled, but that they’re still expecting, as Secretary of State John Kerry has said, that this is a "doable deal" when talks resume November 20.<br/>Do we know what held up the signing of an agreement this weekend?<br/>It appears that the French were adamant on a couple of points—they wanted <br/>AND<br/>a return to capitals to figure out how to get over these obstacles.<br/>And separately, Iran struck an agreement on Monday (November 11) with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). What is the significance there?<br/>This is an overall joint statement on a framework for cooperation. It’s the first <br/>AND<br/>by the IAEA for some time—so it’s a very important step.<br/>If you look at the annex to the agreement, you see that there is access that will be given to a uranium mine ~Gchine mine in Bandar Abbas~. Information will be provided on all new research reactors, as well as information on sixteen sites designated for the construction of nuclear power plants.<br/>But in terms of the Arak facility, the Iranians have promised access to the <br/>AND<br/>IAEA Director-General~ Yukiya Amano has called for in the past.<br/>One other point: I saw Amano when he was in Washington about ten days <br/>AND<br/>but it has some important provisions that the IAEA has been looking for.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>Iran strategy is working—any Congressional rebukes trigger the link<br/>Joel <strong>Rubin</strong>, Politico, <strong>10/20</strong>/13, Iran’s diplomatic thaw with the West, dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=FBFABC3B-C9A8-47F8-A9AC-BC886BCE0552</p><p>Congratulations, Congress. Your Iran strategy is working. Now what?<br/>The diplomatic thaw between Iran and the West is advancing, and faster than most of us had imagined. This is the result of years of painstaking efforts by the Obama administration and lawmakers to pressure the Islamic Republic into deciding whether it’s in Iran’s interest to pursue diplomacy or to continue suffering under crushing economic sanctions and international isolation.<br/>Now that Iran has made a clear decision to engage seriously in diplomatic negotiations with the West over its nuclear program, its intentions should be tested. Members of Congress should be open to seizing this opportunity by making strategic decisions on sanctions policy.<br/>The economic sanctions against Iran that are in place have damaged the Iranian economy. <br/>AND<br/>estimates that it would take roughly one to two years to do so.<br/>Congress, with its power to authorize sanctions relief, plays a crucial role in deciding whether a deal will be achieved. This gives Congress the opportunity to be a partner in what could potentially be a stunning success in advancing our country’s security interests without firing a shot.<br/>Consider the alternative: If the administration negotiates a deal that Congress blocks, and <br/>AND<br/>and worry that failed strikes would push Iran to get the bomb outright.<br/>Iran and the United States need a political solution to this conflict. Now is the time to test the Iranians at the negotiating table, not push them away.<br/>Congress is also being tested, but the conventional wisdom holds that lawmakers won’t show the flexibility required to make a deal. Such thinking misses the political volatility just beneath the surface: Americans simply don’t support another war in the Middle East, as the congressional debate over Syria made crystal clear. Would they back much riskier military action in Iran?<br/>Fortunately for Congress, President Barack Obama was agile enough to seize the diplomatic route and begin to eliminate Syria’s chemical weapons. These results are advancing U.S. security interests. And members of Congress breathed a collective sigh of relief as well as they didn’t have to either vote to undercut the commander in chief on a security issue or stick a finger in the eye of their constituents.<br/>The same can happen on Iran. By pursuing a deal, Obama can provide <br/>AND<br/>and did so without starting another unpopular American war in the Middle East.</p><p>Moderate middle strategy key to keep the Iranians negotiating—<br/><strong>Milani 11/14/13</strong><br/>Abbas, contributing editor at The New Republic, the director of Iranian Studies at Stanford University, and the author, most recently, of The Shah, "Two Reasons Why Iran Resumed Nuclear Negotiations," <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.newrepublic.com/article/115594/iran-nuclear-negotiations-us-resumed-two-reasons  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.newrepublic.com/article/115594/iran-nuclear-negotiations-us-resumed-two-reasons%27" tppabs="http://www.newrepublic.com/article/115594/iran-nuclear-negotiations-us-resumed-two-reasons"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.newrepublic.com/article/115594/iran-nuclear-negotiations-us-resumed-two-reasons</span></a></span></p><p>But a far more important change has been overlooked: For years, Iran’s nuclear <br/>AND<br/>not be allowed to hide all the facts from the people of Iran.</p></div></div></td><td>11/17/13</td></tr><tr><td style="width:100%; word-break:break-all; word-break:break-word;"><div><p><input onclick="saveEntry(13)" src="../../xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" tppabs="http://opencaselist13.paperlessdebate.com/xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" style="float:right;" title="Save" type="image" value="Save"></input>

The same can't be said about attacks by nuclear powers against non-nuclear states.<br/>Indeed, this argument was laid out quite nicely three years ago by Des Browne, the UK's then-Secretary of State for Defense, in a speech to King's College:<br/>Why do we need a nuclear deterrent?<br/>The answer is because it works.

It's one of the basic processes that ecologists study, along with predation and competition. Predators are big beasts that eat their prey from outside. Pathogens (disease-causing agents, such as viruses) are small beasts that eat their prey from within. Although infectious disease can seem grisly and dreadful, under ordinary conditions, it's every bit as natural as what lions do to wildebeests and zebras. But conditions aren't always ordinary.<br/>Just as predators have their accustomed prey, so do pathogens. And just as <br/>AND<br/>presence, sometimes causing illness or death, the result is a zoonosis.<br/>It's a mildly technical term, zoonosis, unfamiliar to most people, but it helps clarify the biological complexities behind the ominous headlines about swine flu, bird flu, Sars, emerging diseases in general, and the threat of a global pandemic. It's a word of the future, destined for heavy use in the 21st century.<br/>Ebola and Marburg are zoonoses. So is bubonic plague.

The least conspicuous strategy is to lurk within what's called <br/>AND<br/>disturbance causes diseases to emerge. Shake a tree and things fall out.<br/>Michelle Barnes is an energetic, late 40s-ish woman, an avid rock climber and cyclist. Her auburn hair, she told me cheerily, came from a bottle. It approximates the original colour, but the original is gone. In 2008, her hair started falling out; the rest went grey "pretty much overnight". This was among the lesser effects of a mystery illness that had nearly killed her during January that year, just after she'd returned from Uganda.<br/>Her story paralleled the one Jaap Taal had told me about Astrid, with several <br/>AND<br/>they were back, watching the sunset. It was Christmas evening 2007.<br/>They arrived home on New Year's Day. On 4 January, Barnes woke up feeling as if someone had driven a needle into her skull. She was achy all over, feverish. "And then, as the day went on, I started developing a rash across my stomach." The rash spread. "Over the next 48 hours, I just went down really fast."<br/>By the time Barnes turned up at a hospital in suburban Denver, she was dehydrated; her white blood count was imperceptible; her kidneys and liver had begun shutting down. An infectious disease specialist, Dr Norman K Fujita, arranged for her to be tested for a range of infections that might be contracted in Africa. All came back negative, including the test for Marburg.<br/>Gradually her body regained strength and her organs began to recover. After 12 days<br/>AND<br/>a Ugandan holiday during which she had visited a cave full of bats.<br/>Barnes spent the next 24 hours Googling every article on the case she could find. Early the following Monday morning, she was back at Dr Fujita's door. He agreed to test her a third time for Marburg. This time a lab technician crosschecked the third sample, and then the first sample.<br/>The new results went to Fujita, who called Barnes: "You're now an honorary infectious disease doctor. You've self-diagnosed, and the Marburg test came back positive."<br/>The Marburg virus had reappeared in Uganda in 2007. It was a small outbreak<br/>AND<br/>for Ugandan miners and their families. It was also an international threat.<br/>The first team of scientists had collected about 800 bats from Kitaka Cave for dissecting and sampling, and marked and released more than 1,000, using beaded collars coded with a number. That team, including scientist Brian Amman, had found live Marburg virus in five bats.<br/>Entering Python Cave after Joosten's death, another team of scientists, again including Amman, came across one of the beaded collars they had placed on captured bats three months earlier and 30 miles away.<br/>"It confirmed my suspicions that these bats are moving," Amman said - and <br/>AND<br/>that question applies.

The heart of Justice Black’s majority opinion began by declaring:<br/>“All legal restrictions which curtail the civil rights of a single racial group are immediately suspect. That is not to say that all such restrictions are unconstitutional. It is to say that courts must subject them to the most rigid scrutiny. Pressing public necessity may sometimes justify the existence of such restrictions; racial antagonism never can.”62<br/>If history has overruled the majority opinion and vindicated the dissenters, as Laurence Tribe said,63 Justice Black’s analysis of discrimination under the Equal Protection Clause still stands. Indeed, the Supreme Court’s modern thinking about equal protection begins with Korematsu. Every subsequent case that construes the Equal Protection Clause descends directly from Korematsu. <br/>For example, in the 1967 case Loving v. Virginia, the Supreme Court <br/>AND<br/>classifications as early as 1967 in Loving, which relied upon Korematsu.77<br/>Thus, even though it seems a bit paradoxical, Korematsu lives as a vital <br/>AND<br/>Korematsu, itself, you would never know Mr. Korematsu lost.”79</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>1NR<br/>Turns solvency – wrecks judicial independence and the credibility of the courts – the are reduced to mere politicians<br/>Burbank 7 (2007, Stephen B., “Judicial Independence, Judicial Accountability, and Interbranch Relations,” <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://georgetownlawjournal.org/files/pdf/95-4/burbank.pdf)JCP  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://georgetownlawjournal.org/files/pdf/95-4/burbank.pdf)JCP%27" tppabs="http://georgetownlawjournal.org/files/pdf/95-4/burbank.pdf)JCP"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://georgetownlawjournal.org/files/pdf/95-4/burbank.pdf)JCP</span></a></span></p><p>Recent scholarship has also brought sharply into focus the fact that formal protections of federal <br/>AND<br/>means of ensuring decisions in accord with the preferences of the dominant coalition.<br/>However dif?cult it may be to amend constitutions, and however much we may like <br/>AND<br/>of no return to the traditional equilibrium in interbranch relations affecting the judiciary.<br/>The current poisonous condition of interbranch relations affecting the judiciary is in one sense unremarkable<br/>AND<br/>in individual cases (or at least those involving issues of high salience).<br/>One need not (and I do not) believe that elected politicians seek to <br/>AND<br/>courts, support that was offered even in the face of unpopular decisions.<br/>Richard Arnold was a distinguished appellate judge and master of federal judicial administration in part <br/>AND<br/>what the architects of our system intended, what developing American constitutionalism requires.<br/>Judge Arnold often stated that the judiciary must have the “continuing consent of the <br/>AND<br/>their punches”11 when the law requires an unpopular decision.<br/>Thus, I believe that Judge Arnold would have been relieved by the decisions of <br/>AND<br/>so.” I also imagine him wondering how long that will be true.</p><p>Specifically – this leads to more situations like korematsu and means the aff doesn’t remove the loaded gun at all<br/>Pushaw ‘4<br/>Robert, James Wilson Endowed Professor, Pepperdine University School of Law, “Defending Deference: A Response to Professors Epstein and Wells,” <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://law.missouri.edu/lawreview/files/2012/11/Pushaw.pdf  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://law.missouri.edu/lawreview/files/2012/11/Pushaw.pdf%27" tppabs="http://law.missouri.edu/lawreview/files/2012/11/Pushaw.pdf"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://law.missouri.edu/lawreview/files/2012/11/Pushaw.pdf</span></a></span></p><p>Although this approach is plausible in theory, I am not sure it would work <br/>AND<br/>blessing his unconstitutional conduct and instead would force him to shoulder full responsibility.</p><p>War turns structural violence<br/>Bulloch 8<br/>Millennium - Journal of International Studies May 2008 vol. 36 no. 3 575-595<br/>&nbsp;Douglas Bulloch, IR Department, London School of Economics and Political Science. <br/>&nbsp;He is currently completing his PhD in International Relations at the London School of Economics, during which time he spent a year editing Millennium: Journal of International Studies&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;But the idea that poverty and peace are directly related presupposes that wealth inequalities <br/>AND<br/>problems as fundamentally economic rather than deeply – and potentially radically – political.&nbsp;</p><p>Korematsu was PQD in every substantive way<br/>Fisher 5 LOUIS FISHER (Senior specialist in Seperation of Powers w/ the Congressional Research Service);

Hardliners and Khamenei will take such legislation as proof that the United States wants regime change, not an end to Iran's nuclear program. Rouhani himself has said that if sanctions legislation passes, negotiations are off.<br/>So why have more than 50 senators signed up as co-sponsors of new sanctions? Some do want regime change.

Assessing the Effectiveness of Leadership Targeting in Counterinsurgency Campaigns," published in International Security (Spring 2012)., 8/22/2012, "Drone Strikes Keep Pressure on al-Qaida", www.rand.org/blog/2012/08/drone-strikes-keep-pressure-on-al-qaida.html)</p><p>Should the U.S. continue to strike at al-Qaida's leadership with drone attacks? A recent poll shows that while most Americans approve of drone strikes, in 17 out of 20 countries, more than half of those surveyed disapprove of them.<br/>My study of leadership decapitation in 90 counter-insurgencies since the 1970s shows that when militant leaders are captured or killed militant attacks decrease, terrorist campaigns end sooner, and their outcomes tend to favor the government or third-party country, not the militants.<br/>Those opposed to drone strikes often cite the June 2009 one that targeted Pakistani Taliban <br/>AND<br/>cited drone strikes as a key motivation for his May 2010 attempted attack.<br/>Compared to manned aircraft, drones have some advantages as counter-insurgency tools, such as lower costs, longer endurance and the lack of a pilot to place in harm's way and risk of capture. These characteristics can enable a more deliberative targeting process that serves to minimize unintentional casualties. But the weapons employed by drones are usually identical to those used via manned aircraft and can still kill civilians—creating enmity that breeds more terrorists.<br/>Yet many insurgents and terrorists have been taken off the battlefield by U.S. drones and special-operations forces. Besides Mehsud, the list includes Anwar al-Awlaki of al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula; al-Qaida deputy leader Abu Yahya al-Li-bi; and, of course, al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden. Given that list, it is possible that the drone program has prevented numerous attacks by their potential followers, like Shazad.<br/>What does the removal of al-Qaida leadership mean for U.S. national security? Though many in al-Qaida's senior leadership cadre remain, the historical record suggests that "decapitation" will likely weaken the organization and could cripple its ability to conduct major attacks on the U.S. homeland.<br/>Killing terrorist leaders is not necessarily a knockout blow, but can make it harder for terrorists to attack the U.S. Members of al-Qaida's central leadership, once safely amassed in northwestern Pakistan while America shifted its focus to Iraq, have been killed, captured, forced underground or scattered to various locations with little ability to communicate or move securely.<br/>Recently declassified correspondence seized in the bin Laden raid shows that the relentless pressure from the drone campaign on al-Qaida in Pakistan led bin Laden to advise al-Qaida operatives to leave Pakistan's Tribal Areas as no longer safe. Bin Laden's letters show that U.S. counterterrorism actions, which had forced him into self-imposed exile, had made running the organization not only more risky, but also more difficult.<br/>As al-Qaida members trickle out of Pakistan and seek sanctuary elsewhere, the U.S. military is ramping up its counterterrorism operations in Somalia and Yemen, while continuing its drone campaign in Pakistan. Despite its controversial nature, the U.S. counter-terrorism strategy has demonstrated a degree of effectiveness.<br/>The Obama administration is committed to reducing the size of the U.S. military's footprint overseas by relying on drones, special operations forces, and other intelligence capabilities.

Procedural Requirements<br/>Currently, officials in the executive branch carry out all such ex ante review of <br/>AND<br/>there is no equivalent effort in areas outside the active conflict zone. n164<br/>Meanwhile, the degree of ex post review of detention decisions depends on the location of detention as opposed to the location of capture. Thus, &nbsp;*1219 &nbsp;Guantanamo detainees are entitled to habeas review, but detainees held in Afghanistan are not, even if they were captured far away and brought to Afghanistan to be detained. n165<br/>Enhanced ex ante and ex post procedural protections for both detention and targeting, coupled with transparency as to the standards and processes employed, serve several important functions: they can minimize error and abuse by creating time for advance reflection, correct erroneous deprivations of liberty, create endogenous incentives to avoid mistake or abuse, and increase the legitimacy of state action.<br/>a. Ex Ante Procedures<br/>Three key considerations should guide the development of ex ante procedures. First, any <br/>AND<br/>employed must be transparent and sufficiently credible to achieve the desired legitimacy gains.<br/>These considerations suggest the value of an independent, formalized, ex ante review system. Possible models include the Foreign Intelligence &nbsp;*1220 &nbsp;Surveillance Court (FISC), n168 or a FISC-like entity composed of military and intelligence officials and military lawyers, in the mode of an executive branch review board. n169<br/>Created by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) in 1978, n170 the <br/>AND<br/>an unauthorized disclosure of an application to or order from the FISC court.<br/>An ex parte review system for targeting and detention outside zones of active hostility could <br/>AND<br/>would leave target identification and time-sensitive decisionmaking to the operators. n174<br/>Moreover, there should be a mechanism for emergency authorizations at the behest of the <br/>AND<br/>place) as soon as practicable but at most within seven days. n176<br/>Finally, and critically, given the stakes in any application namely, the deprivation of life someone should be appointed to represent the potential target's interests and put together the most compelling case that the individual is not who he is assumed to be or does not meet the targeting criteria.<br/>The objections to such a proposal are many. In the context of proposed courts <br/>AND<br/>to avoid ad hoc decisionmaking and will ensure consistency across administrations and time.<br/>Some also condemn the ex parte nature of such reviews. n179 But again, <br/>AND<br/>which an official is obligated to act as advocate for the potential target.<br/>That said, there is a reasonable fear that any such court or review board <br/>AND<br/>those features in and of themselves can lead to increased reflection and restraint.<br/>Additional accountability mechanisms, such as civil or criminal sanctions in the event of material misrepresentations or omissions, the granting of far-reaching authority to the relevant Inspectors General, and meaningful ex post review by Article III courts, n182 are also needed to help further minimize abuse.<br/>Conversely, some object to the use of courts or court-like review as <br/>AND<br/>Article III-FISC model, further addresses some of the constitutional concerns.<br/>Some also have warned that there may be no "case or controversy" for <br/>AND<br/>would be issuing a warrant for the most extreme type of seizure. n189<br/>It is also important to emphasize that a reviewing court or review board would not <br/>AND<br/>available to deal with exceptional cases where ex ante approval is not possible.<br/>Additional details will need to be addressed, including the temporal limits of the court's <br/>AND<br/>the threat, consistent with what courts regularly do when they issue warrants.<br/>In the absence of such a system, the President ought to, at a <br/>AND<br/>Given the stakes, a clear and convincing evidentiary standard is warranted. n195<br/>While this proposal is obviously geared toward the United States, the same principles should apply for all states engaged in targeting operations. n196 States would ideally subject such determinations to independent review or, alternatively, clearly articulate the standards and procedures for their decisionmaking, thus enhancing accountability.<br/>b. Ex Post Review<br/>For targeted-killing operations, ex post reviews serve only limited purposes. They <br/>AND<br/>against rash ex ante decisionmaking, thereby providing a self-correcting mechanism.<br/>Ex post review should also be accompanied by the establishment of a solatia and condolence payment system for activities that occur outside the active zone of hostilities. Extension of such a system beyond Afghanistan and Iraq would help mitigate resentment caused by civilian deaths or injuries and would promote better accounting of the civilian costs of targeting operations. n198</p><p>CASE<br/>SOLVENCY</p><p>Drone court is unworkable—doesn’t solve legitimacy<br/>Vladeck, professor of law – American University Washington College of Law, 2/27/’13<br/>(Stephen I., “Statement of Stephen I.

From its inception, it was the ultimate rubber-stamp court, having rejected a total of zero government applications - zero - in its first 24 years of existence, while approving many thousands. In its total 34 year history - from 1978 through 2012 - the Fisa court has rejected a grand total of 11 government applications, while approving more than 20,000.<br/>Despite how obedient and compliant this court always was, the Bush administration decided in <br/>AND<br/>in essence, simply legalized the warrantless eavesdropping scheme of the Bush administration.<br/>That new Fisa law vested vast new surveillance powers in the US government to spy <br/>AND<br/>no reforms, and Congress, on a fully bipartisan basis, complied.<br/>One of the provisions of the new Fisa law requires the DOJ annually to disclose to Congress the number of eavesdropping applications it files and the number approved and rejected by the Fisa court.

Tetlock et al argue that there are many other factors between the decision process and the outcome. The outcome of any decision-making process, they argue, will only have a certain probability of success due to various environmental factors (such as luck).<br/>A large-scale study researching decision-making in seven major American corporations concluded that decision-making worked best when following a sound information processing method; however these groups also showed signs of groupthink, in that they had strong leadership which attempted to persuade others in the group that they were right (Peterson et al, 1998, cited in Sunstein, 2003).<br/>Esser (1998) found that groupthink characteristics were correlated with failures; however cohesiveness did not appear to be a factor: groups consisting of strangers, friends, or various levels of previous experience together did not appear to effect decision-making ability. Janis' claims of insulation of groups and groups led by autocratic leaders did show that these attributes were indicative of groupthink symptoms.<br/>Moorhead and Montanari conducted a study where they concluded that groupthink symptoms had no significant effect on group performance, and that "the relationship between groupthink-induced decision defects and outcomes were not as strong as Janis suggests" (Moorhead and Montanari, 1986, p. 399; cited by Choi and Kim, 1999).<br/>Overall, the groupthink hypothesis appears to be valuable as a descriptive, analytic and <br/>AND<br/>that can help illuminate the inexact spheres of organizational behaviour and communications theory.&nbsp;</p><p>ACCOUNTABILITY</p><p>Existing norms solve and precedent isn’t key<br/>Anderson, professor of international law – American University, ‘13<br/>(Kenneth, "The Case for Drones", <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/the-case-for-drones/)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed using an unsupported protocol (e.g., gopher).  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/the-case-for-drones/)%27" tppabs="https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/the-case-for-drones/)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/the-case-for-drones/)</span></a></span></p><p>The objection to civilian deaths draws out a related criticism: Why should the United <br/>AND<br/>behaves malignantly, drones will not be responsible.

In truth, the roots of the conflict -- and the reasons it has not yet exploded -- are much deeper. Put simply, China cannot afford military conflict with any of its Asian neighbors.<br/>It is not that China believes it would lose such a spat; the country <br/>AND<br/>, from authorizing the use of deadly force in the Diaoyu Islands theater.<br/>For over three decades, Beijing has promoted peace and stability in Asia to facilitate <br/>AND<br/>Today, China's economy is second only to that of the United States.<br/>The fundamentals of Deng's grand economic strategy are still revered in Beijing. But any <br/>AND<br/>thus little reason to think that China is readying for war with Japan.<br/>At the same time, the specter of rising Chinese nationalism, although often seen <br/>AND<br/>in China and, almost as quickly, catalyze popular protests against Japan.<br/>Demonstrators would call for blood, and if the government (fearing economic instability) did not extract enough, citizens would agitate against Beijing itself. Those in Zhongnanhai, the Chinese leadership compound in Beijing, would find themselves between a rock and a hard place.<br/>It is possible that Xi lost track of these basic facts during the fanfare of his rise to power and in the face of renewed Japanese assertiveness. It is also possible that the Chinese state is more rotten at the core than is understood. That is, party elites believe that a diversionary war is the only way to hold on to power -- damn the economic and social consequences.<br/>But Xi does not seem blind to the principles that have served Beijing so well over the last few decades. Indeed, although he recently warned unnamed others about infringing upon China's "national core interests" during a foreign policy speech to members of the Politburo, he also underscored China's commitment to "never pursue development at the cost of sacrificing other country's interests" and to never "benefit ourselves at others' expense or do harm to any neighbor."</p><p>This is a bad joke—territorial dispute makes the conflict inevitable, America is not involved so the norm wouldn’t apply, the issue is surveillance drones, AND THERE’S NO IMPACT<br/>Auslin, resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, 11-5-13<br/>(Michael, “Tensions Are Escalating in The East China Sea,” <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303482504579178850122997242  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303482504579178850122997242%27" tppabs="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303482504579178850122997242"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303482504579178850122997242</span></a></span>, accessed 11-9-13, CMM)</p><p>The East China Sea may see the world's first war started by aerial drones. <br/>AND<br/>and advanced aircraft is also certain to drive Asia's arms spending even higher.<br/>UMW’s card ends<br/>Washington may want to avoid endorsing the territorial claims of either Tokyo or Beijing, <br/>AND<br/>old-fashioned diplomacy to keep the East China Sea from boiling over.</p><p>SAUDI</p><p>Economic collapse doesn’t cause war<br/>Jervis, professor of political science – Columbia University, ‘11<br/>(Robert, Force in Our Times,” Survival, Vol. 25, No. 4, p. 403-425)</p><p>Even if war is still seen as evil, the security community could be dissolved <br/>AND<br/>times bring about greater economic conflict, it will not make war thinkable.</p><p>Data disproves hegemony impacts<br/>Fettweis, 11<br/>Christopher J.

As usual, the pessimistic ICG forecasts resumption of a war, escalation of tensions, however, being untruthful in an attempt to preserve the appearance of objectivity.<br/>In its overview titled Armenia and Azerbaijan: A Season of Risks, the group predicts that “should a full-scale conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan break out again, some or all of the regional powers – Russia, Turkey and Iran – could be drawn in, directly.”<br/>“Vigorous international engagement is needed to lessen chances of violent escalation during coming weeks and months,” the Group believes, setting hopes on Russia: “Russia, which is highly influential in all aspects of the conflict and would be the most directly affected of the Minsk co-chairs by a new war, should act more decisively to broker an agreement. It could advance this by announcing a suspension of arms supplies to both sides.”<br/>Now, about being untruthful. In its analysis, the Group says. “Peace talks on Nagorno-Karabakh bogged down in 2011, accelerating an arms race and intensifying strident rhetoric. Terms like “Blitzkrieg’’, “pre-emptive strike’’ and ‘‘total war” have gained currency with both sides’ planners.”<br/>The truth is, Armenian side does not engage in military rhetoric, the latter being Azerbaijan’s “privilege,” with the country’s leadership missing no chance to express their aggressive moods. Armenia’s “strident rhetoric” is limited to mere expressions of readiness to resist Azeri attacks.<br/>Same with “accelerating an arms race.” Baku is the one overtly purchasing and manufacturing inordinate amounts of weaponry, in violation of all international quotas to compensate for lack of expertise in its army, which has already been defeated once.<br/>But back to the analysis. “An immediate concern is military miscalculation, with implications that could far exceed those of a localized post-Soviet frozen conflict, as the South Caucasus, a region where big powers meet and compete, is now also a major energy corridor. Clashes increasingly occur along the Azerbaijani-Armenian frontier far from Nagorno Karabakh, the conflict’s original focus,” the analysis says.<br/>Now what the analysis dubs as “clashes” are incessant Azeri-staged provocations, with Baku sinking as low as shelling Armenian villages or preventing a doctor from aiding a person blown up on a mine who later bled to death, as they did only recently.<br/>As the analysis notes, “the possibility of internal political unrest in both countries increases the uncertainty. Unrest at home might tempt leaders to deflect attention by raising military tensions or to embark on risky attempts to capitalize on their adversary’s troubles.”<br/>Last year, Sabine Freizer, Director of the European Programs in the International Crisis Group gave yet another prediction of an oncoming war in Karabakh.<br/>“Armenian -Azerbaijani clashes may grow into a war in the region, where BP Company and its partners invested USD 35 billion in energy projects. Both parties to the conflict maintain weak control of the line of contact. Large-scale hostilities may soon erupt by accident, as a consequence of retaliatory measures taken,” she said.<br/>Probably reluctant to seem Cassandra-like and be slammed by Yerevan or Baku, <br/>AND<br/>states and Azerbaijan having close ethnic, political and economic ties with Turkey.<br/>Luckily, Freizer’s predictions failed to come true, similarly to previous analysis-based forecasts of the ICG. The question is, who pays the Group to issue somber predictions and escalate the tension over the issue?

As it stands, Mr. Johnson said, the government doesn't disclose classified CIA counterterrorism successes and cannot "confirm, deny or clarify" accusations of errant strikes or civilian casualties.<br/>He also argued the military would give a stronger legal basis for counterterrorism operations. The military currently conducts some of the U.S. drone strikes in Yemen and all of the strikes in Somalia and Afghanistan.<br/>Mr. Johnson's speech came as questions mount about drone use, both from liberal human-rights groups as well as conservatives such as Sen. Rand Paul, the Kentucky Republican who recently waged a nearly 13-hour filibuster on the subject.<br/>The growing suspicion has spurred proposals for a national-security court to approve the addition of terror suspects to an administration kill list.<br/>Sen. Angus King (I., Maine) said it was critical for there to be some check on the government's power when it comes to targeting American citizens. "This isn't an insertion of a court…into a war-fighting situation," Sen. King said. "We are talking about targeting Americans in situations where there is time for an intermediate step."<br/>The drone program has also been debated within the military. Leon Panetta, former defense secretary and onetime CIA director, favors greater military control. But some senior officers have said moving the program away from the agency likely would lead to more restrictions, making it harder to target militants. The officers also say increasing strikes' transparency would give the public more information but could allow militants to learn more, possibly enough to avoid being targeted.<br/>Under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, Congress has set up court oversight of national-security surveillance inside the U.S.<br/>Voicing doubts about establishment of a similar court to oversee drone strikes, Mr. Johnson said its proceedings would be secret and judges likely would reject few of the government's requests. That would lead the media and the public to take a skeptical view of it, he said.<br/>Mr. Johnson added that such a court may be unconstitutional, by infringing on the president's role as commander in chief.</p><p>Congress wants a rubber stamp—ensures implementation is marred, even if theoretical backing for the plan is sound. <br/>Ditz 13 (Jason, “Lawmakers Push Plans to Advance Drone Strikes”, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://news.antiwar.com/2013/02/10/lawmakers-push-plans-to-advance-drone-strikes/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://news.antiwar.com/2013/02/10/lawmakers-push-plans-to-advance-drone-strikes/%27" tppabs="http://news.antiwar.com/2013/02/10/lawmakers-push-plans-to-advance-drone-strikes/"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://news.antiwar.com/2013/02/10/lawmakers-push-plans-to-advance-drone-strikes/</span></a></span>, ZBurdette)</p><p>With the multi-year drone assassination campaign of President Obama suddenly getting some attention in Congress, a number of Representatives and Senators are laying out their personal views on the program and ideas for improving it.<br/>The views are varied in exact position but not so much in substance, as virtually to a man the lawmakers are endorsing drone assassinations in some form more or less unchanged from what it is now, and are just debating the best way to get some formal legal system around the practice of summary, worldwide execution-by-robot.<br/>Sen. John McCain (R – AZ) was critical of the idea of the CIA assassinating people with drones in the first place, mysteriously an issue that he hasn’t discussed much in the past four-plus years of them doing so.<br/>His proposal isn’t to stop assassinating people or to take President Obama’s power to unilaterally do so away, of course. Instead McCain simply believes the drones should be under the Pentagon’s control, saying that it wasn’t a “spy agency” thing to do.<br/>Sen. Rand Paul (R – KY) called it “very unseemly” that the president can kill people without any review, though he added that he was “probably for executing” Americans abroad with drones and simply wanted to see the evidence first.<br/>Rep. Mike Rogers (R – MI), the Intelligence Committee Chair, says things are fine the way they are, claiming to have personally overseen every single air strike in the war on terror, whether it was launched by the Pentagon or the CIA. The lack of legal structure which has so confounded his Senate counterparts appeared totally irrelevant to him, leaving him accusing them of exaggerating the problem.<br/>Perhaps the least comfortable with the program was Rep. Keith Ellison (D – MN), who says that it is time for Congressional hearings on the practice and the creation of some sort of legal framework surrounding the killings.<br/>Nominee for CIA Director John Brennan has opposed changes to the program, including calls from some Senators to create a secret court to examine evidence against potential victims, saying that the drones were not for retaliatory killings, but rather killing people for what they will do in the future, something which would be difficult to build a court around.<br/>As with Congress, the concern for killing people simply on the basis that they <br/>AND<br/>Congress for over four years, the interest must seem quaint to them.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>2NC RUBBER STAMP—AT: CONGRESS ENFORCES<br/>Structural limitations on Congressional drone oversight prevent effective challenges. <br/>Ross 13 (Alice, Salon, “Is congressional drone oversight working?”, AUG 1, 2013, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.salon.com/2013/08/01/is_congressional_drone_oversight_working_partne/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.salon.com/2013/08/01/is_congressional_drone_oversight_working_partne/%27" tppabs="http://www.salon.com/2013/08/01/is_congressional_drone_oversight_working_partne/"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.salon.com/2013/08/01/is_congressional_drone_oversight_working_partne/</span></a></span>, ZBurdette)</p><p>The challenges of oversight<br/>The Bureau has previously questioned the effectiveness of the intelligence committees’ oversight of drone strikes. In February 2013. Feinstein used opening remarks at John Brennan’s nomination hearings to claim her committee had done its ‘utmost to confirm’ low civilian casualties in CIA drone strikes.<br/>The Bureau contacted four fellow independent organisations which had carried out field investigations looking at civilian casualties in Pakistan. Each had published evidence of civilian casualties – yet none had ever been contacted by committee members or their staff in response to their findings, raising concerns the committee is too dependent on the intelligence community’s assessments.<br/>Current committee members have complained about being blocked from robust scrutiny. At Brennan’s nomination <br/>AND<br/>questions, they were evaded; they were distorted, et cetera.’<br/>Such evasions are not limited to CIA directors. In June the director of national intelligence, James Clapper, admitted he had given the SSCI a ‘clearly erroneous’ response earlier in the year when he told an open hearing that the National Security Agency (NSA) did not ‘wittingly’ collect data on millions of Americans. The public retraction came only after former intelligence contractor Edward Snowden leaked documents indicating that such mass surveillance programmes were in operation.<br/>Even where members can access information, Feinstein has said the committee can be blocked from acting on it. Following Brennan’s hearing, Feinstein told political blog The Hill: ‘Right now it is very hard to oversee the drone programme because it is regarded as a covert activity, so when you see something that is wrong and you ask to be able to address it, you are told no.’<br/>The present scrutiny system evolved in the wake of the Watergate affair. A series of controversial intelligence practices emerged, including attempted assassinations of overseas political leaders and illegal intelligence-gathering on US citizens.<br/>Amid a growing sense that the intelligence services had been allowed to run amok, a series of inquiries – the most well-known of which was the Church Commission, headed by Senator Frank Church – combed through the activities of the CIA, FBI and NSA, identifying multiple abuses and overreachings. The Senate and House intelligence committees were established to provide the kind of scrutiny that might prevent such abuses happening again.<br/>A source with knowledge of the intelligence committees under previous administrations pointed the Bureau to the significant challenges of overseeing operations that are by their very nature secret.<br/>They pointed out that the committee has the power to request access to any information it requires. But this requires members or staffers to know such information exists. ‘It’s a serious question as to how much any elected official could possibly understand about what’s going on inside,’ the source said. Politicians had to ask themselves:<br/>‘Do I know enough to ask the right questions, and how can I count on really being given the full picture?,’ they added.<br/>‘If you wanted to find out what’s really going on, you had to get really tough – you had to talk to people and say, cut the crap. If you lie to me, I will have your head on a plate,’ the source told the Bureau.<br/>Regarding the current committee’s oversight of the drone programme, they said, ‘Did somebody really do a tough job there and put the necessary pressure on people to get a result?’<br/>While elected members might struggle to find the time to delve into complex matters of national security, the close links between committee staffers and the intelligence community can further hamper scrutiny, the source added.<br/>‘You can’t get a job on one of these committees if you don’t have high-level security clearance – so you can’t get a job without being part of the system. This automatically puts you inside a circle of people who all can talk to each other, but in the knowledge that if they step out of line when the job’s finished, they will be finished.<br/>‘There’s a huge risk for any staff member who crosses people inside the system,’ they said.<br/>‘This is the problem of the netherworld and its interaction with democratic institutions… It really is a very difficult problem and the solution that Frank Church came up with wasn’t enough,’ said the source.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>1NC AT: LIMITING DRONES GOOD ADV<br/>Turn—drone court would legitimize and expand drone use. <br/>Vladeck 13 (Steve, professor of law and the associate dean for scholarship at American University Washington College of Law, Lawfare, “Why a “Drone Court” Won’t Work–But (Nominal) Damages Might…”, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.lawfareblog.com/2013/02/why-a-drone-court-wont-work/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.lawfareblog.com/2013/02/why-a-drone-court-wont-work/%27" tppabs="http://www.lawfareblog.com/2013/02/why-a-drone-court-wont-work/"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.lawfareblog.com/2013/02/why-a-drone-court-wont-work/</span></a></span>, February 10, ZBurdette)</p><p>III. &nbsp;Drone Courts and the Legitimacy Problem<br/>That brings me to perhaps the biggest problem we should all have with a “drone court”–the extent to which, even if one could design a legally and practically workable regime in which such a tribunals could operate, its existence would put irresistible pressure on federal judges to sign off even on those cases in which they have doubts.<br/>As a purely practical matter, it would be next to impossible meaningfully to assess <br/>AND<br/>-the-fact record.

A recent, unclassified intelligence assessment concurred with the White House’s caution, asserting that new sanctions “would undermine the prospects for a successful comprehensive nuclear agreement with Iran.”<br/>However, in an open rebuke of the White House, the intelligence community and the 10 Senate committee chairs who cautioned against new sanctions, Sens. Robert Menendez, D-N.J.; Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Mark Kirk, R-Ill., have introduced a bill (S. 1881) to impose new oil and financial sanctions on Iran.<br/>Supporters of this measure stress that new sanctions would take effect only if Iran violates <br/>AND<br/>it best: “New sanctions stand to kill any hope for diplomacy.”<br/>Already, anti-Geneva-deal counterparts in Iran’s parliament have responded with their own provocation, introducing legislation to require Iran to enrich near weapons grade if the United States imposes new sanctions.<br/>Like the Senate sanctions bill, the Iranian parliament’s legislation would have a delayed trigger. Like the Senate bill, the mere introduction of this reckless legislation isn’t a violation of the letter of the Geneva agreement per se. But both bills risk restarting the vicious cycle of confrontation that has defined the U.S.-Iran relationship for decades.<br/>Without a significant public outcry, support for this sanctions bill could potentially reach a veto-proof majority of 67 senators and 290 representatives in the House.<br/>Minnesota could play an important role in this showdown between supporters of using hard-nosed diplomacy to avoid military action and reduce nuclear risk, and those who would upend sensitive negotiations and make war likely. About half of the senators have staked out their positions, but neither Sen. Amy Klobuchar nor Sen. Al Franken have yet taken a public stance.<br/>Minnesota is one of just 10 states where neither senator has taken a public position on whether or not to sign onto sanctions that would sink the deal — and risk another war in the Middle East.<br/>While some new-sanctions proponents are banking on partisan politics to earn support from Republicans, it would still take seven of the remaining 23 undecided Democrats, along with all Republicans, to reach a veto-proof majority. All eyes will be on those 23 undecided Democrats — including Klobuchar and Franken.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>Heg doesn’t solve Mid East war <br/>POTTER, Adjunct Associate Professor of International and Public Affairs – Columbia University, March ‘11<br/>(Lawrence, “Persian Gulf Security: Patterns and Prospects,” in “Iran and the West,” eds.

Security Council plus Germany was reached in November in Geneva, aimed at persuading Iran to curb parts of its nuclear work, in return for a limited easing of sanctions.<br/>Hardline clerics close to Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, Revolutionary Guards commanders and the intelligence services have attacked the temporary concessions Rouhani has made, although Khamenei has so far backed the president.<br/>Khamenei has the final say on all state matters, including the nuclear issue.<br/>The talks on February 18 will seek a comprehensive agreement defining the permissible scope of Iran's nuclear activity. Western powers fear the nuclear program is aimed at creating atomic weapons capabilities. Iran denies this.<br/>IRNA said the response of from the clerics in Qom, in central Iran, was unanimously positive.<br/>Support from Qom, whose clerics traditionally have influence among core supporters of the establishment, is likely to boost Rouhani's government's position in the next round of talks in Vienna, having already won over more reform-minded clerics.<br/>The backing of the clergy is essential as they have direct access to ordinary Iranians in their sermons when they can mobilize people to display their support for the deal, under which Tehran seeks to end painful economic sanctions that have severely damaged its oil-dependent economy.<br/>"This government has inspired hope in our society. Its way of communicating has put us in line with other cultures," said Grand Ayatollah Lotfollah Safi Golpaygani, referring to Rouhani's tone compared to his hardline predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, since his landslide election win.<br/>Demonstrating their support for Rouhani, some clerics blamed Ahmadinejad's government for the struggling economy as well as Iran's political isolation.<br/>"Poor leadership by the previous government is at the root of much of our problems today," IRNA quoted conservative Ayatollah Abdollah Javadi-Amoli as saying.<br/>Rouhani, whose election led to a thaw in ties with the West after years of confrontation and hostile rhetoric, has promised to pursue a consistent foreign policy of "prudence and moderation" to revive the economy.<br/>The deal is good enough and that’s all that matters<br/>Kenneth Pollack, 11/15/13, An Iran nuclear deal doesn’t have to be perfect — just better than the alternatives, www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/an-iran-nuclear-deal-doesnt-have-to-be-perfect--just-better-than-the-alternatives/2013/11/15/2b8d1292-4c85-11e3-be6b-d3d28122e6d4_story.html</p><p>We are still a long way from a formal international agreement restraining Iran’s nuclear program<br/>AND<br/>better than our other options.

Richard Durbin (D., Ill.), a Senate Foreign Relations Committee member.<br/>The White House and lawmakers have wrestled over the issue for months. Many in Congress support new sanctions, while the administration insists such a step would disrupt high-level negotiations with Tehran. A six-month deal provides Iran with relief from international sanctions in exchange for enhanced inspections and Tehran's agreement to halt or roll back parts of its nuclear program.<br/>Sen. Robert Menendez (D., N.J.), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, argued the agreement provides Iran with economic benefits that outpace what Western governments have received in return. He said he remained concerned Iran would never agree to fully put aside its nuclear ambitions.<br/>"I am convinced that we should only relieve pressure on Iran in return for verifiable concessions that will fundamentally dismantle Iran's nuclear program," Mr. Menendez said.<br/>A top State Department official argued that any move by the U.S. to impose new sanctions would risk unraveling the international talks. "It is crucial we give diplomacy a chance to succeed," Wendy Sherman, the State Department undersecretary of political affairs, told the Foreign Relations panel.<br/>President Barack Obama and his administration have urged lawmakers to hold off on additional actions. Mr. Obama vowed in his State of the Union address to veto any bill "that threatens to derail these talks."<br/>Lawmakers have bristled at some of the White House criticism, particularly the suggestion that those seeking more sanctions were in favor of war. Sen. Timothy Kaine (D., Va.), addressing those complaints Tuesday, said that those who support new sanctions "are not pro-war and those that oppose it are not soft on Iran or anti-Israel."</p><p>Iran sanctions have stalled now—insufficient Dem defections to override his veto<br/>JTA, staff writer, 2/6/14, GOP senators press Reid on Iran sanctions vote, www.jta.org/2014/02/06/news-opinion/politics/gop-senators-press-reid-on-iran-sanctions-vote</p><p>Forty-two Republican senators urged the Democratic-led Senate’s majority leader, Sen.

Mark Kirk (R-Ill.), a lead sponsor of the bill. “It’s time to vote.”<br/>President Obama has said that he would veto any new sanctions, which he says could scuttle talks aimed at keeping Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Democratic support for the new bill, introduced in December, has waned considerably.<br/>A number of top Democrats, including several who originally sponsored the bill, now say they do not want it to advance while talks are underway.<br/>A sizable portion of the Democratic caucus in the U.S. House of Representatives is also now opposed to new sanctions, although that body overwhelmingly approved a similar bill last summer, months before the new talks between Iran and the major powers, including the United States, were launched.<br/>The Senate bill has 59 co-sponsors, eight short of the 67 it would need to override an Obama veto.<br/>Reid has so far resisted bringing the bill to the floor.

While former president Mahmoud Ahmedinejad was emotional and shrill in his opposition to the United States, there remains in Iran a cadre of Western-trained technocrats, fluent in English and nuanced in their understanding of the world. President Hassan Rouhani has surrounded himself with such people, and Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has charged them with investigating a different relationship between Iran and the United States.<br/>As they do so, they cannot help but be aware that on the eve of Rouhani’s inauguration, the US House of Representatives voted 400–20 to impose stiff additional sanctions on Iran. The House saw Rouhani’s electoral victory as a call for toughness, not potential compromise.<br/>If Iran were to make concessions in a negotiation with the United States, they would surely seek sanctions relief and other actions requiring congressional approval. To make such concessions to Obama, they would need some confidence that he can deliver. A president who cannot bring around a hostile Congress is not a president with whom it is worth negotiating.<br/>Plan passage enables Iran sanction passage—only potential bill for amendment<br/>JTA, staff writer, 2/6/14, GOP senators press Reid on Iran sanctions vote, www.jta.org/2014/02/06/news-opinion/politics/gop-senators-press-reid-on-iran-sanctions-vote</p><p>Reid has so far resisted bringing the bill to the floor. Proponents of the new sanctions say they would strengthen the West’s hand in Iran negotiations, adding that without new sanctions, the momentum in the talks is moving in Iran’s favor.<br/>According to the Daily Beast, Republicans may attempt to attach the bill to must-pass legislation as an amendment, and could refuse cooperation on other bills in order to force Reid to call a vote.</p><p>Your author clarifies there is zero Congressional debate on TKs—its just a liberal NYTimes blog post patting McCain on the back for a random statement<br/>David Firestone, NYTimes, 1/22/14, On Drones, Keeping the Public in the Dark, takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/22/on-drones-keeping-the-public-in-the-dark/</p><p>We don’t get to say this very often on The Times editorial page, but Senator John McCain was absolutely right last week to decry a secret deal in the 2014 spending bill. He pointed out that the bill contained a classified section that prohibited the Pentagon from taking over the C.I.A.’s role in carrying out drone strikes, as President Obama has proposed.<br/>Only a few lawmakers — apparently, not including Mr. McCain — knew about the secret ban until The Washington Post revealed it. As Mr. McCain pointed out, it shouldn’t have been secret, and it shouldn’t have been in an appropriations bill.<br/>“The Appropriations Committee is supposed to appropriate,” he said. “The Appropriations Committee has no business making this decision. How many of my colleagues knew that this provision was in this mammoth appropriations bill? I bet a handful.”<br/>There were no hearings on the matter, neither in Appropriations nor in any of the committees that are actually supposed to debate these things, like Armed Services or Intelligence.<br/>Whether lawmakers back the Pentagon or the C.I.A. reflects, <br/>AND<br/>conduct the drone strikes as well as the C.I.A.<br/>But what’s really at issue in this dispute isn’t military competence; it’s the competing goals of secrecy and accountability. The Obama administration wanted to shift control of the strikes to the Pentagon as part of a plan for greater transparency. At the moment, it officially acknowledges the Pentagon program, but won’t discuss or even admit the fact that the C.I.A. fires bombs at terror targets in Pakistan.<br/>Many people in Congress like it that way. As long as the drone strikes <br/>AND<br/>the country’s endless secret war against terrorists, and this time it won.</p></div></div></td><td>2/9/14</td></tr></table><div id="divHiddenCites" style="display: none;">
