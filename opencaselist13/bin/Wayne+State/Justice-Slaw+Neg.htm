It was finding himself in that negotiation to begin with. Earlier this year, Obama refused to negotiate over the debt ceiling, and Republicans caved and raised it. If he had done that in 2011, they would probably have done the same thing. Instead, Obama took their demand to reduce the deficit at face value and thought, Hey, I want to reduce the deficit, too — why donand#39;t we use this opportunity to strike a deal? As it happened, Republicans care way, way, way more about low taxes for the rich than low deficits, which made a morally acceptable deal, or even something within hailing distance of a morally acceptable deal, completely impossible. and#34;By the point at which Obama figured this out in 2011, the debt ceiling loomed and it was too late to credibly insist he wouldnand#39;t negotiate over it. Sequestration was a pretty good way to escape fiscal calamity.

political victory from a legal defeat in the Supreme Court, serving notice to Democrats that they must back President Bush on how to try suspects at Guantanamo Bay or risk being branded as weak on terrorism.<br/>In striking down the military commissions Bush sought for trials of suspected members of al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups, the high court Thursday invited Congress to establish new rules and put the issue prominently before the public four months before the midterm elections. As the White House and lawmakers weighed next steps, House GOP leaders signaled they are ready to use this weekand#39;s turn of events as a political weapon.<br/>House Majority Leader John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) criticized House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosiand#39;s comment Thursday that the court decision and#34;affirms the American ideal that all are entitled to the basic guarantees of our justice system.and#34; That statement, Boehner said, amounted to Pelosiand#39;s advocating and#34;special privileges for terrorists.and#34;<br/>Similar views ricocheted around conservative talk radio -- Rush Limbaugh called Pelosiand#39;s comments and#34;derangedand#34; on his show Thursday -- and Republican strategists said they believed that the decision presented Bush a chance to put Democrats on the spot while uniting a Republican coalition that lately has been splintered on immigration, spending and other issues.<br/>and#34;It would be good politics to have a debate about this if Democrats are going to argue for additional rights for terrorists,and#34; said Terry Nelson, a prominent GOP political strategist who was political director for Bushand#39;s reelection campaign in 2004.</p><p>Shielding arguments don’t apply—1nc Parsons and Moore are on point</p><p>Reducing war powers will end Obama’s credibility with Congress – it causes stronger GOP pushback on the debt ceiling – and the fight alone will wreck markets<br/>Seeking Alpha, 9/10/13 (“Syria Could Upend Debt Ceiling Fight”, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://seekingalpha.com/article/1684082-syria-could-upend-debt-ceiling-fight)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://seekingalpha.com/article/1684082-syria-could-upend-debt-ceiling-fight)%27" tppabs="http://seekingalpha.com/article/1684082-syria-could-upend-debt-ceiling-fight)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://seekingalpha.com/article/1684082-syria-could-upend-debt-ceiling-fight)</span></a></span></p><p>Unless President Obama can totally change a reluctant publicand#39;s perception of another Middle-Eastern <br/>AND<br/>, a rebuff from the House is a 67-75 probability.<br/>I reach this probability by looking within the whip count. I assume the 164 <br/>AND<br/>the breakdown, the chance of House passage is about one in four.<br/>While a failure in the House would put action against Syria in limbo, I have felt that the market has overstated the impact of a strike there, which would be limited in nature. Rather, investors should focus on the profound ripple through the power structure in Washington, which would greatly impact impending battles over spending and the debt ceiling.<br/>Currently, the government loses spending authority on September 30 while it hits the debt ceiling by the middle of October. Markets have generally felt that Washington will once again strike a last-minute deal and avert total catastrophe. Failure in the Syrian vote could change this. For the Republicans to beat Obama on a Presidentand#39;s strength (foreign military action), they will likely be emboldened that they can beat him on domestic spending issues.<br/>Until now, consensus has been that the two sides would compromise to fund the <br/>AND<br/>setting us up for a showdown that will rival 2011and#39;s debt ceiling fight.<br/>I currently believe the two sides will pass a short-term continuing resolution to <br/>AND<br/>the showdown with the Dow falling 500 points in one session in 2011.<br/>As markets panicked over the potential for a U.S. default, we <br/>AND<br/>10. Investors must be prepared for this and#34;black swanand#34; event.<br/>Looking back to August 2011, stocks that performed the best were dividend paying, less-cyclical companies like Verizon (VZ), Wal-Mart (WMT), Coca-Cola (KO) and McDonaldand#39;s (MCD) while high beta names like Netflix (NFLX) and Boeing (BA) were crushed. Investors also flocked into treasuries despite default risk while dumping lower quality bonds as spreads widened. The flight to safety helped treasuries despite U.S. government issues. I think we are likely to see a similar move this time.<br/>Assuming there is a Syrian and#34;noand#34; vote, I would begin to roll <br/>AND<br/>. Conversely, gold (GLD) should benefit from the fear trade.<br/>I would also like to address the potential that Congress does not vote down the <br/>AND<br/>tactic, and Congress will have to vote within the next two weeks.<br/>The final possibility is that Democrats back their President and barely ram the Syria resolution <br/>AND<br/>still be the debt ceiling fight leading to some drama not no drama.<br/>Remember, in politics everything is connected. Syria is not a stand-alone issue. Its resolution will impact the power structure in Washington. A failed vote in Congress is likely to make the debt ceiling fight even worse, spooking markets, and threatening default on U.S. obligations unless another last minute deal can be struck.<br/>A2: Not Announced Till June<br/>--Kills ground – it makes the aff a moving target and removes uniqueness considerations from DA evaluation.</p><p>“Should” is immediate and mandatory.<br/>SUMMER ‘94 (Justice, Oklahoma City Supreme Court, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CIteID=  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CIteID=%27" tppabs="http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CIteID="><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CIteID=</span></a></span> 20287#marker3fn14)<br/>The legal question to be resolved by the court is whether the word “should<br/>AND<br/>. 336, 337, 27 L.Ed. 201 (1882).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Substantial requires that the increase be definite and immediate<br/>Words and Phrases 64, (40 WandP 759)<br/>The words “outward, open, actual, visible, substantial, and exclusive<br/>AND<br/>or pertaining to any others; undivided; sole; opposed to inclusive.<br/>Totally leaks<br/>James Q.

Lew issued his strongest warning yet to Congress about the economic consequences of waiting until just before the deadline to pass an increase.<br/>and#34;Trying to time a debt-limit increase to the last minute could be very dangerous,and#34; Lew told the Economic Club of Washington on Tuesday. and#34;We cannot afford for Congress to gamble with the full faith and credit of the United States of America.and#34;<br/>Republicans are balking at raising the $16.7-trillion debt limit, which Congress must do by as early as mid-October, unless the Obama administration agrees to major concessions including deep spending cuts and a delay in implementing the healthcare reform law.<br/>During a meeting last week, House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) gave Lew a list of times in the past when the White House and Congress used the need to raise the debt limit as a way to find bipartisan solutions on fiscal issues, Boehnerand#39;s office said.<br/>Boehner has said that any increase in the debt limit must be offset by budget cuts or spending reforms at least as large as the increase.<br/>But Lew reiterated Tuesday that President Obama would not negotiate over raising the debt limit because it involves paying for bills already authorized by Congress and because the notion of a federal government default should not be a bargaining chip.<br/>Lew specifically ruled out a delay in the healthcare law, the Affordable Care Act, a move being pushed by some House conservatives.<br/>and#34;Thatand#39;s just not reality, and theyand#39;re going to have to start dealing in reality,and#34; he said.<br/>But as the Treasury runs out of the accounting maneuvers it has used since the spring to continue borrowing to pay the nationand#39;s bills, Lew said lawmakers needed to act.<br/>Since the U.S. technically reached its debt limit in the spring, the Treasury has been using so-called extraordinary measures, such as suspending investments in some federal pension funds, to juggle the nationand#39;s finances to pay bills. Those measures will be exhausted by the middle of October.<br/>Lew noted that Washington politicians like to wait until they are up against a deadline to act, as they often do with spending bills and did last year with the so-called fiscal cliff, the combination of automatic tax increases and government spending cuts.<br/>But the debt limit is different, Lew said, because of the complexity of identifying an exact date when the nation would run out of borrowing authority -- and because of the consequences of a first-ever federal government default.<br/>Lew said a default would be and#34;a self-inflicted wound that can do harm to our economy right at a moment when the recovery is strengthening.and#34;<br/>A bitter battle over the debt limit in 2011, resolved at the last minute, raised fears of a first-ever U.S. government default. The lengthy standoff led Standard and Poorand#39;s to downgrade the nationand#39;s credit rating for the first time and triggered financial market turmoil along with a deep drop in consumer confidence.<br/>and#34;Some in Congress seem to think they can keep us from failing to pay our nationand#39;s bills by simply raising the debt ceiling right before the moment our cash balance is depleted,and#34; Lew said. Such a view is misguided, he said.<br/>The Treasury Department doesnand#39;t know with precision the exact day that it wonand#39;t have enough incoming cash to make all the required outgoing payments once it runs out of borrowing authority.<br/>Lew formally told Congress last month that the Treasury would run out of borrowing authority in mid-October. At that point, the government would be able to pay bills only with cash on hand of about $50 billion on any given day.<br/>An analysis released last week by the Bipartisan Policy Center, which also cited the difficulty of pegging an exact date, estimated that the U.S. would run out of borrowing authority between Oct. 18 and Nov. 5.<br/>The vagaries of the debt-limit issue mean that Congress must act sooner rather than later, Lew said.<br/>and#34;Iand#39;m nervous about the desire to drive this to the last minute when the last minute is inherently unknowable and the risk of making a mistake could be catastrophic,and#34; he said.</p></div></div></td><td>10/1/13</td></tr><tr><td style="width:100%; word-break:break-all; word-break:break-word;"><div><p><input onclick="saveEntry(90)" src="../../xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" tppabs="http://opencaselist13.paperlessdebate.com/xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" style="float:right;" title="Save" type="image" value="Save"></input>

Many of those arrested for terrorism have been charged with planning to use “weapons of mass destruction” even though they were working, at most, on small explosives or contemplating planting a hand grenade in a trash bin.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>No nuclear retaliation<br/>Neely 3/21/13 Meggaen Neely is a research intern for the Project on Nuclear Issues, Center for Strategic and International Studies, 3/21/13, Doubting Deterrence of Nuclear Terrorism, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://csis.org/blog/doubting-deterrence-nuclear-terrorism  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://csis.org/blog/doubting-deterrence-nuclear-terrorism%27" tppabs="http://csis.org/blog/doubting-deterrence-nuclear-terrorism"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://csis.org/blog/doubting-deterrence-nuclear-terrorism</span></a></span>, jj</p><p>Because of the difficulty of deterring transnational actors, many deterrence advocates shift the focus <br/>AND<br/>communication required for credible retaliatory strikes under deterrence of nuclear terrorism is missing.</p><p>Terrorists can’t get bioweapons<br/>The Economist 1-8-11 (“A bug’s life; Bioterror; Africa and security,” lexis, jj)</p><p>Sceptics say Mr Lugar is scaremongering abroad for political gain at home.

Journeying up and down the Ganges Delta, he encounters a fisherman who claims to know the source of all truth. “The world,” the fisherman explains, “rests upon the back of an elephant.”<br/>“But what does the elephant stand on?” the ethnographer asks.<br/>“A turtle.”<br/>“And the turtle?”<br/>“Another turtle.”<br/>“And it?”<br/>“Ah, friend,” smiles the fisherman, “it is turtles all the way down.”<br/>As with most well-circulated apocrypha, it is a parable that lacks a <br/>AND<br/>only raises the question, “Why do we think we know better?”<br/>Since the early 1970s we have wondered—with increasing anxiety—why and if <br/>AND<br/>particularities, to individualities, oddities, discontinuities, contrasts, and singularities.”<br/>This growing anxiety over the precision of our interpretive powers has translated into a variety <br/>AND<br/>only ask, “what is the right thing for us to do?”<br/>This shift in scale has had a significant impact on the Left over the past <br/>AND<br/>what Geertz has called—the “thin” to the “thick.”<br/>Class, race, and gender—those classic left themes—are, to <br/>AND<br/>. As post-Marxists Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe declared in 1985,<br/>Left-wing thought today stands at a crossroads.

The general assemblies and general strikes were efforts <br/>AND<br/>during this spring’s May Day protests, “Why work? Be happy.”<br/>In many ways, the Occupy movement was a rebellion against the institutionalized nature of <br/>AND<br/>institutionalism and personal freedom that has most often been affiliated with the Right.<br/>Seeking an alternative to the bureaucratic tendencies of capitalism and socialism, Occupiers were to frequently invoke the image of autonomy: of a world in which social and economic relations exist outside the institutions of the state. Their aspiration was a society based on organic, decentralized circuits of exchange and deliberation—on voluntary associations, on local debate, on loose networks of affinity groups.<br/>If political and economic life had become abstracted in the age of globalization and financialization, then Occupy activists wanted to re-politicize our everyday choices. As David Graeber, one of Occupy’s chief theoretical architects, explained two days after Zuccotti Park was occupied, “The idea is essentially that “the system is not going to save us,” so “we’re going to have to save ourselves.”<br/>Borrowing from the anarchist tradition, Graeber has called this work “direct action”: <br/>AND<br/>a new subjectivity from which one can project the future into the present.<br/>Direct action and horizontal democracy are new names, of course, for old ideas<br/>AND<br/>attempting to resist the often autocratic tendencies of a fast-globalizing capitalism.<br/>But direct action and horizontal democracy also tap into a longer, if often neglected<br/>AND<br/>also new modes of what he calls “self-management and organization.”<br/>With direct action and horizontal democracy, the Occupy movement not only developed a set <br/>AND<br/>what Castoriadis obliquely referred to as—“the self-institution of society.”<br/>The seemingly spontaneous movement that emerged after the first general assemblies in Zuccotti Park was <br/>AND<br/>horizontalist ethos that believes that revolution will begin by transforming our everyday lives.<br/>It can be argued that horizontalism is, in many ways, a product of <br/>AND<br/>the polity that functions best when the state is absent from everyday decisions.<br/>But one can also find in its anti-institutionalism an attempt to speak in <br/>AND<br/>.” We need, in other words, to stop thinking like leftists.<br/>But herein lies the problem. Not all possible forms of human existence and social <br/>AND<br/>—in which, in other words, there is a moral hierarchy.<br/>More problematically, by working outside structures of power one may circumvent coercive systems but <br/>AND<br/>cloak those hierarchies spawned from non-institutional forms of power and capital.<br/>This is a particularly pointed irony for a political ideology that claims to be opposed <br/>AND<br/>, creativity, devotion, love and trust back into numbers once again.”<br/>In many ways, this is the result of a set of political ideas that <br/>AND<br/>recognize that “there is no such thing as a society without institutions.”<br/>This is—and will be—a problem for the horizontalist Left as it <br/>AND<br/>but to discover “new kinds of relationship between society and its institutions.”<br/>Horizontalism has come to serve as an important break from the static strategies and categories <br/>AND<br/>that, in our age of ever more stratification, we must resist.</p><p>Grounding politics in social location prevents comprehensive analysis of SOCIAL RELATIONS as a totality—causes a “snapshot” approach to understanding oppression that blocks class struggle<br/>- snapshot <br/>Susan Ferguson ’08, is Assistant Professor in the Journalism Program at the Wilfrid Laurier University, Brantford Campus.
