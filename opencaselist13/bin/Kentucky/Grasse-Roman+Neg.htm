Since the Korean War, scholars and pundits have grown increasingly alarmed by the growing scope and techniques of presidential war making. In 1973, in the wake of Vietnam, Congress passed the joint War Powers Resolution (WPR) to increase Congress’s role in foreign policy and war making by requiring executive consultation with Congress prior to the use of military force, reporting within 48 hours after the start of hostiles, and requiring the close of military operations after 60 days unless Congress has authorized the use of force. Although the WPR was a significant legislative feat, 30 years since its passage, presidents have frequently ignores the WPR requirements and the changing nature of conflict does not fit neatly into these regulations. After the terrorist attacks on 9-11, many experts worry that executive war powers have expanded far beyond healthy limits. &nbsp;Consequently, there is a fear that continued expansion of these powers will undermine the constitutional system of checks and balances that maintain the democratic foundation of this country and risk constant and unlimited military actions, particularly in what Stephen Griffin refers to as a "long war" period like the War on Terror (<span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674058286).  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674058286).%27" tppabs="http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674058286)."><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674058286).</span></a></span> In comparison, pro-presidential powers advocates contend that new restrictions undermine flexibility and timely decision-making necessary to effectively counter contemporary national security risks.

Since the Korean War, scholars and pundits have grown increasingly alarmed by the growing scope and techniques of presidential war making. In 1973, in the wake of Vietnam, Congress passed the joint War Powers Resolution (WPR) to increase Congress’s role in foreign policy and war making by requiring executive consultation with Congress prior to the use of military force, reporting within 48 hours after the start of hostiles, and requiring the close of military operations after 60 days unless Congress has authorized the use of force. Although the WPR was a significant legislative feat, 30 years since its passage, presidents have frequently ignores the WPR requirements and the changing nature of conflict does not fit neatly into these regulations. After the terrorist attacks on 9-11, many experts worry that executive war powers have expanded far beyond healthy limits. &nbsp;Consequently, there is a fear that continued expansion of these powers will undermine the constitutional system of checks and balances that maintain the democratic foundation of this country and risk constant and unlimited military actions, particularly in what Stephen Griffin refers to as a "long war" period like the War on Terror (<span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674058286).  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674058286).%27" tppabs="http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674058286)."><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674058286).</span></a></span> In comparison, pro-presidential powers advocates contend that new restrictions undermine flexibility and timely decision-making necessary to effectively counter contemporary national security risks. Thus, a debate about presidential wars powers is important to investigate a number of issues that have serious consequences on the status of democratic checks and national security of the United States.¶ Lastly, debating presidential war powers is important because we the people have an important role in affecting the use of presidential war powers.

Indeed, perhaps one of the most taken-for-granted features of contemporary social theory (especially the variety that purports to be “radical”) is the ritualistically dismissive and increasingly generic critique of Marxism in terms of its alleged failure to address forms of oppression other than that of “class.” Marxism is considered to be theoretically bankrupt and intellectually passé, and class analysis is often savagely lampooned as a rusty weapon wielded clumsily by those mind locked in the jejune factories of the 19th and 20th centuries. When Marxist class analysis has not been distorted or equated with some crude version of “economic determinism,” teleology or essentialism, it has been attacked for diverting attention away from the categories of “difference”—including “race” (Gimenez, 2001).1 To overcome the presumed inadequacies of Marxism, an entire discursive apparatus sometimes called “post-Marxism” has arisen to fill the void. Regardless of Marx’s enduring relevance (cf. Greider, 1998) and despite the fact that much of post-Marxism is actually an outlandish “caricature” of Marx and the entire Marxist tradition, it has eaten through the “left like a cancer” and has “established itself as the new common sense” (Johnson, 2002, p. 129). Eager to take a wide detour around political economy, post-Marxists (who often go by other names such as postmodernists, poststructuralists, radical multiculturalists, etc.) tend to assume that the principal political points of departure must necessarily be “cultural.” Many but not all post-Marxists have gravitated toward a politics of difference that is largely premised on uncovering relations of power that reside in a variety of cultural and ideological practices (cf. Jordan andWeedon, 1995). Advocates of difference politics posit their ideas as bold steps forward in advancing the interests of those historically marginalized by dominant social and cultural narratives. Various strands of post-Marxism have undoubtedly advanced our knowledge of the hidden trajectories of power and their fetishizing instrumentalities within the processes of representation, and they remain somewhat useful in discerning the relationships between difference, language, and cultural configurations. At the same time, however, the rhetorical excesses of post-Marxists—enamored with the cultural and seemingly blind to the economic—have been woefully remiss in addressing the constitution of class formations and the stark reality of contemporary conditions under global capitalism. In some instances, capitalism and class relations have been thoroughly “otherized;” in others, class is reduced to “classism” and summoned only as part of the triumvirate of race, class, and gender in which class is portrayed as merely another form of difference. As we hope to show, the radical displacement of class analysis in contemporary theoretical narratives and the concomitant decentering of capitalism, the anointing of difference as a primary explanatory construct, and the “culturalization” of politics have had detrimental effects on “Left” theory and practice. The concept of difference has been one of the most potent weapons in the theoretical arsenal of those seeking to dismantle the contributions of the philosophes of the European Enlightenment as well as the revolutionary corpus of the Marxist tradition.2 For the most part, the issue of difference has been taken up around two basic constellations. First, it has been used to (a) contest liberal humanism’s notion of a unified and static subjectivity; (b) elaborate an understanding of subjectivity as fractured, multiple, and fluid; and (c) examine the discursive constitution of the subject within language itself. The second approach to difference has generally revolved around differences between groups (particularly as they pertain to race, ethnicity, etc.), resulting in discourses of “identity” politics. Of course, in political terms there has been an increasingly fierce divide between how these two approaches to difference operate in relation to “identity” (Fuery and Mansfield, 2000).3 It is clearly beyond the parameters of this article to explore these debates. Although there are significant distinctions between these variant positions, it is important to note that both converge to the extent that they valorize difference and heterogeneity as animating principles and in doing so have largely displaced the concept of class and the analysis of capitalism from the theoretical and political canvas. Our purpose here is not to rehash those well-worn debates or challenge their tenability. Rather, we view this effort, however partial, as a beginning—a point from which to launch a reconceptualization of difference. For the most part, contemporary narratives have stressed the cultural dimensions of difference while marginalizing and, in some cases, ignoring its economic and material dimensions. This posturing has been quite evident in many post-al theories of “race” and in the realm of “ludic” cultural studies that have valorized accounts of difference in almost exclusively “superstructuralist” terms (Sahay, 1998). But this treatment of difference and claims about “the ‘relative autonomy’ of ‘race’ have been enabled by a reduction and distortion of Marxian class analysis” that involves “equating class analysis with some version of economic determinism” (Meyerson, 2000). The key move in this distorting gesture depends on the “view that the economic is the base, the cultural/political/ ideological the superstructure.” It is then “relatively easy to show that the (presumably non-political) economic bases does not cause the political/cultural/ ideological superstructure, that the latter is/are not epiphenomenal but rela-tively autonomous or autonomous causal categories” (Meyerson, 2000, p. 2). In such formulations, the “cultural” is treated as a separate and autonomous sphere, severed from its embeddedness within sociopolitical and economic arrangements. As a result, “culturalist” narratives have produced autonomist and reified conceptualizations of difference that “far from enabling those subjects most marginalized by racial difference” have in effect reduced “difference to a question of knowledge/power relations” that can presumably be “dealt with (negotiated) on a discursive level without a fundamental change in the relations of production” (Sahay, 1998, p. 10). To suggest that culture is generally conditioned/shaped by material forces and social relations linked to production does not reinscribe the simplistic and presumably deterministic base/superstructure metaphor, which has plagued some strands of Marxist theory. Rather, such a formulation draws on Marx’s own writings from both the Grundrisse (Marx, 1858/1973) and Capital (Marx, 1867/1967) in which he contended that there is a consolidating logic in the relations of production that permeates society in the complex variety of its “empirical” reality.4 This emphasizes Marx’s understanding of capitalism and capital as a “social” relation—one that stresses the interpenetration of these categories and one that offers a unified and dialectical analysis of history, ideology, culture, politics, economics, and society (see Marx, 1863/1972, 1867/1976a, 1866/1976b, 1865/1977a, 1844/1977b). Moreover, foregrounding the limitations of “difference” and “representational” politics does not suggest a disavowal of the importance of cultural and/or discursive arena(s) as sites of contestation. We readily acknowledge the significance of theorizations that have sought to valorize precisely those forms of difference that have historically been denigrated. They have helped to uncover the genealogy of terror hidden within the drama of Western democratic life. This has been an important development that has enabled subordinated groups to reconstruct their own histories and give voice to their individual and collective identities (Bannerji, 1995; Scatamburlo-D’Annibale and Langman, 2002). Contemporary theorists have also contributed to our understanding of issues of “otherness” and “race” as hegemonic articulations (Hall, 1980, 1987, 1988), the cultural politics of race and racism and the implications of raciology (Gilroy, 1990, 2000), as well as the epistemological violence perpetrated by Western theories of knowledge (Goldberg, 1990, 1993). Miron and Inda’s (2000) work, drawing on Judith Butler’s theory of performativity, has been insightful in showing how race works to constitute the racial subject through a reiterative discursive practice that achieves its effect through the act of naming and the practice of shaming. Hence, we would not discount the salience of such concerns, but nor should progressives be straightjacketed by struggles that fail to move beyond the discursive/ cultural/textual realms. Such approaches have sometimes tended to redefine politics as a signifying activity generally confined to the realm of “representation” while displacing a politics grounded in the mobilization of forces against the material sources of political and economic marginalization. In this regard, textual/discursive politics have their limitations for they fail to guarantee the “material power necessary for social flourishing and living freely” (Goldberg, 1994, p. 13).5 In their rush to avoid the “capital” sin of “economism,” far too many post-al theorists (who often ignore their own class privilege) have fallen prey to an ahistorical form of culturalism that holds, among other things, that cultural antagonism external to class analysis and struggle provide the cutting edge of emancipatory politics. In many respects, this posturing has yielded an intellectual pseudopolitics that has served to empower “the theorist while explicitly disempowering” real citizens (Turner, 1994, p. 410). Although space limitations prevent us from elaborating this point further, we contend that such positions are deeply problematic in terms of their penchant for de-emphasizing the totalizing (yes totalizing!) power and function of capital and for their attempts to employ culture as a construct that would diminish the centrality of class.6 In a proper historical materialist account, “culture” is not the “other” of class but rather constitutes part of a more comprehensive theorization of class relations in different contexts (cf. Scatamburlo-D’Annibale and Langman, 2002). Because post-al theories of difference often circumvent the material dimensions of difference and tend to segregate questions of difference from analyses of class formation and capitalist social relations, we contend that it is necessary to (re)conceptualize difference by drawing on Marx’s materialist and historical formulations. Difference needs to be understood as the product of social contradictions and in relation to political and economic organization. Because systems of difference almost always involve relations of domination and oppression, we must concern ourselves with the economies of relations of difference that exist in specific contexts. Drawing on the Marxist concept of mediation enables us to unsettle the categorical (and sometimes overly rigid) approaches to both class and difference for it was Marx himself who warned against creating false dichotomies at the heart of our politics—that it was absurd to choose between consciousness and the world, subjectivity and social organization, personal or collective will, and historical or structural determination. In a similar vein, it is equally absurd to see “difference as a historical form of consciousness unconnected to class formation, development of capital and class politics” (Bannerji, 1995, p. 30). Bannerji has pointed to the need to historicize difference in relation to the history and social organization of capital and class (inclusive of imperialist and colonialist legacies) and to acknowledge the changing configurations of difference and “otherness.” Apprehending the meaning and function of difference in this manner necessarily highlights the importance of exploring (a) the institutional and structural aspects of difference; (b) the meanings and connotations that are attached to categories of difference; (c) how differences are produced out of, and lived within, specific his-torical, social, and political formations; and (d) the production of difference in relation to the complexities, contradictions, and exploitative relations of capitalism. Moreover, it presents a challenge to “identitarian” understandings of difference based almost exclusively on questions of cultural and/or racial hegemony. In such approaches, the answer to oppression often amounts to creating greater cultural space for the formerly excluded to have their voices heard (represented). Much of what is called the “politics of difference” is little more than a demand for an end to monocultural quarantine and for inclusion into the metropolitan salons of bourgeois representation—a posture that reinscribes a neoliberal pluralist stance rooted in the ideology of free market capitalism. In short, the political sphere is modeled on the marketplace, and freedom amounts to the liberty of all vendors to display their different “cultural” goods. A paradigmatic expression of this position is encapsulated in the following passage that champions a form of difference politics whose presumed aim is to make social groups appear. Minority and immigrant ethnic groups have laid claim to the street as a legitimate forum for the promotion and exhibition of traditional dress, food, and culture. . . . This is a politics of visibility and invisibility. Because it must deal with a tradition of representation that insists on subsuming varied social practices to a standard norm, its struggle is as much on the page, screen . . . as it is at the barricade and in the parliament, traditional forums of political intervention before the postmodern. (Fuery and Mansfield, 2000, p. 150) This position fosters a “fetishized” understanding of difference in terms of primordial and seemingly autonomous cultural identities and treats such “differences” as inherent, as ontologically secure cultural traits of the individuals of particular cultural communities. Rather than exploring the construction of difference within specific contexts mediated by the conjunctural embeddedness of power differentials, we are instead presented with an overflowing cornucopia of cultural particularities that serve as markers of ethnicity, race, group boundaries, and so forth. In this instance, the discourse of difference operates ideologically—cultural recognition derived from the rhetoric of tolerance averts our gaze from relations of production and presents a strategy for attending to difference as solely an ethnic, racial, or cultural issue. What advocates of such an approach fail to acknowledge is that the forces of diversity and difference are allowed to flourish provided that they remain within the prevailing forms of capitalist social arrangements. The neopluralism of difference politics cannot adequately pose a substantive challenge to the productive system of capitalism that is able to accommodate a vast pluralism of ideas and cultural practices. In fact, the post-al themes of identity, difference, diversity, and the like mesh quite nicely with contemporary corporate interests precisely because they revere lifestyle—the quest for, and the cultivation of, the self—and often encourage the fetishization of identities in the marketplace as they compete for “visibility” (Boggs, 2000; Field, 1997). Moreover, the uncritical, celebratory tone of various forms of difference politics can also lead to some disturbing conclusions. For example, if we take to their logical conclusion the statements that “postmodern political activism fiercely contests the reduction of the other to the same,” that post-al narratives believe that “difference needs to be recognized and respected at all levels” (Fuery andMansfield, 2000, p. 148), and that the recognition of different subject positions is paramount (Mouffe, 1988, pp. 35-36), their political folly becomes clear. Eagleton (1996) sardonically commented on the implications: Almost all postmodern theorists would seem to imagine that difference, variability and heterogeneity are “absolute” goods, and it is a position I have long held myself. It has always struck me as unduly impoverishing of British social life that we can muster a mere two or three fascist parties. . . . The opinion that plurality is a good in itself is emptily formalistic and alarmingly unhistorical. (pp. 126-127) The liberal pluralism manifest in discourses of difference politics often means a plurality without conflict, contestation, or contradiction. The inherent limitations of this position are also evident if we turn our attention to issues of class. Expanding on Eagleton’s observations and adopting the logic that seems to inform the unqualified celebration of difference, one would be compelled to champion class differences as well. Presumably, the differences between the 475 billionaires whose combined wealth now equals the combined yearly incomes of more than 50 of the world’s population are to be celebrated—a posturing that would undoubtedly lend itself to a triumphant endorsement of capitalism and inequitable and exploitative conditions. San Juan (1995) noted that the cardinal flaw in current instantiations of culturalism lies in its decapitation of discourses of intelligibility from the politics of antagonistic relations. He framed the question quite pointedly: “In a society stratified by uneven property relations, by asymmetrical allocation of resources and of power, can there be equality of cultures and genuine toleration of differences?” (pp. 232- 233).</p><p>Not basing race in political economy creates a culture politics focused on representation, subversion and individual relations which normalizes neoliberal hegemony-this culminates in a leveling of the play field of how one relates to neoliberal violence instead of a new positive vision of society<br/>Reed, Pennsylvania political science professor specializing in race and American politics, 2013<br/>(Adolph, “Django Unchained, or, The Help: How “Cultural Politics” Is Worse Than No Politics at All, and Why”, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://nonsite.org/feature/django-unchained-or-the-help-how-cultural-politics-is-worse-than-no-politics-at-all-and-why)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://nonsite.org/feature/django-unchained-or-the-help-how-cultural-politics-is-worse-than-no-politics-at-all-and-why)%27" tppabs="http://nonsite.org/feature/django-unchained-or-the-help-how-cultural-politics-is-worse-than-no-politics-at-all-and-why)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://nonsite.org/feature/django-unchained-or-the-help-how-cultural-politics-is-worse-than-no-politics-at-all-and-why)</span></a></span><br/>In both films the bogus happy endings are possible only because they characterize their respective regimes of racial hierarchy in the superficial terms of interpersonal transactions. In The Help segregationism’s evil was small-minded bigotry and lack of sensitivity; it was more like bad manners than oppression. In Tarantino’s vision, slavery’s definitive injustice was its gratuitous and sadistic brutalization and sexualized degradation. Malevolent, ludicrously arrogant whites owned slaves most conspicuously to degrade and torture them. Apart from serving a formal dinner in a plantation house—and Tarantino, the Chance the Gardener of American filmmakers (and Best Original Screenplay? Really?) seems to draw his images of plantation life from Birth of a Nation and Gone With the Wind, as well as old Warner Brothers cartoons—and the Mandingo fighters and comfort girls, Tarantino’s slaves do no actual work at all; they’re present only to be brutalized. In fact, the cavalier sadism with which owners and traders treat them belies the fact that slaves were, first and foremost, capital investments. It’s not for nothing that New Orleans has a monument to the estimated 20,000-30,000 antebellum Irish immigrants who died constructing the New Basin Canal; slave labor was too valuable for such lethal work. The Help trivializes Jim Crow by reducing it to its most superficial features and irrational extremes. The master-servant nexus was, and is, a labor relation. And the problem of labor relations particular to the segregationist regime wasn’t employers’ bigoted lack of respect or failure to hear the voices of the domestic servants, or even benighted refusal to recognize their equal humanity. It was that the labor relation was structured within and sustained by a political and institutional order that severely impinged on, when it didn’t altogether deny, black citizens’ avenues for pursuit of grievances and standing before the law. The crucial lynchpin of that order was neither myopia nor malevolence; it was suppression of black citizens’ capacities for direct participation in civic and political life, with racial disfranchisement and the constant threat of terror intrinsic to substantive denial of equal protection and due process before the law as its principal mechanisms. And the point of the regime wasn’t racial hatred or enforced disregard; its roots lay in the much more prosaic concern of dominant elites to maintain their political and economic hegemony by suppressing potential opposition and in the linked ideal of maintaining access to a labor force with no options but to accept employment on whatever terms employers offered. (Those who liked The Help or found it moving should watch The Long Walk Home, a 1990 film set in Montgomery, Alabama, around the bus boycott. I suspect that’s the film you thought you were watching when you saw The Help.) Django Unchained trivializes slavery by reducing it to its most barbaric and lurid excesses. Slavery also was fundamentally a labor relation. It was a form of forced labor regulated—systematized, enforced and sustained—through a political and institutional order that specified it as a civil relationship granting owners absolute control over the life, liberty, and fortunes of others defined as eligible for enslavement, including most of all control of the conditions of their labor and appropriation of its product. Historian Kenneth M. Stampp quotes a slaveholder’s succinct explanation: “‘For what purpose does the master hold the servant?’ asked an ante-bellum Southerner. ‘Is it not that by his labor, he, the master, may accumulate wealth?’”1 That absolute control permitted horrible, unthinkable brutality, to be sure, but perpetrating such brutality was neither the point of slavery nor its essential injustice. The master-slave relationship could, and did, exist without brutality, and certainly without sadism and sexual degradation. In Tarantino’s depiction, however, it is not clear that slavery shorn of its extremes of brutality would be objectionable. It does not diminish the historical injustice and horror of slavery to note that it was not the product of sui generis, transcendent Evil but a terminus on a continuum of bound labor that was more norm than exception in the Anglo-American world until well into the eighteenth century, if not later. As legal historian Robert Steinfeld points out, it is not so much slavery, but the emergence of the notion of free labor—as the absolute control of a worker over her person—that is the historical anomaly that needs to be explained.2 Django Unchained sanitizes the essential injustice of slavery by not problematizing it and by focusing instead on the extremes of brutality and degradation it permitted, to the extent of making some of them up, just as does The Help regarding Jim Crow. The Help could not imagine a more honest and complex view of segregationist Mississippi partly because it uses the period ultimately as a prop for human interest cliché, and Django Unchained’s absurdly ahistorical view of plantation slavery is only backdrop for the merger of spaghetti western and blaxploitation hero movie. Neither film is really about the period in which it is set. Film critic Manohla Dargis, reflecting a decade ago on what she saw as a growing Hollywood penchant for period films, observed that such films are typically “stripped of politics and historical fact…and instead will find meaning in appealing to seemingly timeless ideals and stirring scenes of love, valor and compassion” and that “the Hollywood professionals who embrace accuracy most enthusiastically nowadays are costume designers.”3 That observation applies to both these films, although in Django concern with historically accurate representation of material culture applies only to the costumes and props of the 1970s film genres Tarantino wants to recall. To make sense of how Django Unchained has received so much warmer a reception among black and leftoid commentators than did The Help, it is useful to recall Margaret Thatcher’s 1981 dictum that “economics are the method: the object is to change the soul.”4 Simply put, she and her element have won. Few observers—among opponents and boosters alike—have noted how deeply and thoroughly both films are embedded in the practical ontology of neoliberalism, the complex of unarticulated assumptions and unexamined first premises that provide its common sense, its lifeworld. Objection to The Help has been largely of the shooting fish in a barrel variety: complaints about the film’s paternalistic treatment of the maids, which generally have boiled down to an objection that the master-servant relation is thematized at all, as well as the standard, predictable litany of anti-racist charges about whites speaking for blacks, the film’s inattentiveness to the fact that at that time in Mississippi black people were busily engaged in liberating themselves, etc. An illustration of this tendency that conveniently refers to several other variants of it is Akiba Solomon, “Why I’m Just Saying No to ‘The Help’ and Its Historical Whitewash” in Color Lines,August 10, 2011, available <span class="wikicreatelink"><a href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://opencaselist13.paperlessdebate.com/bin/create/%2F%2Fcolorlines.com%2Farchives%2F2011%2F08%2Fwhy_im_just_saying_no_to_the_help.html/Grasse%2DRoman+Neg?parent=Kentucky.Grasse%2DRoman+Neg  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it was unavailable, or its retrieval was aborted, or the project was stopped too soon.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://opencaselist13.paperlessdebate.com/bin/create/%2F%2Fcolorlines.com%2Farchives%2F2011%2F08%2Fwhy_im_just_saying_no_to_the_help.html/Grasse%2DRoman+Neg?parent=Kentucky.Grasse%2DRoman+Neg%27" tppabs="http://opencaselist13.paperlessdebate.com/bin/create/%2F%2Fcolorlines.com%2Farchives%2F2011%2F08%2Fwhy_im_just_saying_no_to_the_help.html/Grasse%2DRoman+Neg?parent=Kentucky.Grasse%2DRoman+Neg"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">Grasse-Roman Neg</span></a></span> Defenses of Django Unchained pivot on claims about the social significance of the narrative of a black hero. One node of this argument emphasizes the need to validate a history of autonomous black agency and “resistance” as a politico-existential desideratum. It accommodates a view that stresses the importance of recognition of rebellious or militant individuals and revolts in black American history. Another centers on a notion that exposure to fictional black heroes can inculcate the sense of personal efficacy necessary to overcome the psychological effects of inequality and to facilitate upward mobility and may undermine some whites’ negative stereotypes about black people. In either register assignment of social or political importance to depictions of black heroes rests on presumptions about the nexus of mass cultural representation, social commentary, and racial justice that are more significant politically than the controversy about the film itself. In both versions, this argument casts political and economic problems in psychological terms. Injustice appears as a matter of disrespect and denial of due recognition, and the remedies proposed—which are all about images projected and the distribution of jobs associated with their projection—look a lot like self-esteem engineering. Moreover, nothing could indicate more strikingly the extent of neoliberal ideological hegemony than the idea that the mass culture industry and its representational practices constitute a meaningful terrain for struggle to advance egalitarian interests. It is possible to entertain that view seriously only by ignoring the fact that the production and consumption of mass culture is thoroughly embedded in capitalist material and ideological imperatives. That, incidentally, is why I prefer the usage “mass culture” to describe this industry and its products and processes, although I recognize that it may seem archaic to some readers. The mass culture v. popular culture debate dates at least from the 1950s and has continued with occasional crescendos ever since.5 For two decades or more, instructively in line with the retreat of possibilities for concerted left political action outside the academy, the popular culture side of that debate has been dominant, along with its view that the products of this precinct of mass consumption capitalism are somehow capable of transcending or subverting their material identity as commodities, if not avoiding that identity altogether. Despite the dogged commitment of several generations of American Studies and cultural studies graduate students who want to valorize watching television and immersion in hip-hop or other specialty market niches centered on youth recreation and the most ephemeral fads as both intellectually avant-garde and politically “resistive,” it should be time to admit that that earnest disposition is intellectually shallow and an ersatz politics. The idea of “popular” culture posits a spurious autonomy and organicism that actually affirm mass industrial processes by effacing them, especially in the putatively rebel, fringe, or underground market niches that depend on the fiction of the authentic to announce the birth of new product cycles. The power of the hero is a cathartic trope that connects mainly with the sensibility of adolescent boys—of whatever nominal age. Tarantino has allowed as much, responding to black critics’ complaints about the violence and copious use of “nigger” by proclaiming “Even for the film’s biggest detractors, I think their children will grow up and love this movie. I think it could become a rite of passage for young black males.”6 This response stems no doubt from Tarantino’s arrogance and opportunism, and some critics have denounced it as no better than racially presumptuous. But he is hardly alone in defending the film with an assertion that it gives black youth heroes, is generically inspirational or both. Similarly, in a January 9, 2012 interview on the Daily Show, George Lucas adduced this line to promote his even more execrable race-oriented live-action cartoon, Red Tails, which, incidentally, trivializes segregation in the military by reducing it to a matter of bad or outmoded attitudes. The ironic effect is significant understatement of both the obstacles the Tuskegee airmen faced and their actual accomplishments by rendering them as backdrop for a blackface, slapped-together remake of Top Gun. (Norman Jewison’s 1984 film, A Soldier’s Story, adapted from Charles Fuller’s A Soldier’s Play, is a much more sensitive and thought-provoking rumination on the complexities of race and racism in the Jim Crow U.S. Army—an army mobilized, as my father, a veteran of the Normandy invasion, never tired of remarking sardonically, to fight the racist Nazis.) Lucas characterized his film as “patriotic, even jingoistic” and was explicit that he wanted to create a film that would feature “real heroes” and would be “inspirational for teenage boys.” Much as Django Unchained’s defenders compare it on those terms favorably to Lincoln, Lucas hyped Red Tails as being a genuine hero story unlike “Glory, where you have a lot of white officers running those guys into cannon fodder.” Of course, the film industry is sharply tilted toward the youth market, as Lucas and Tarantino are acutely aware. But Lucas, unlike Tarantino, was not being defensive in asserting his desire to inspire the young; he offered it more as a boast. As he has said often, he’d wanted for years to make a film about the Tuskegee airmen, and he reports that he always intended telling their story as a feel-good, crossover inspirational tale. Telling it that way also fits in principle (though in this instance not in practice, as Red Tails bombed at the box office) with the commercial imperatives of increasingly degraded mass entertainment. Dargis observed that the ahistoricism of the recent period films is influenced by market imperatives in a global film industry. The more a film is tied to historically specific contexts, the more difficult it is to sell elsewhere. That logic selects for special effects-driven products as well as standardized, decontextualized and simplistic—“universal”—story lines, preferably set in fantasy worlds of the filmmakers’ design. As Dargis notes, these films find their meaning in shopworn clichés puffed up as timeless verities, including uplifting and inspirational messages for youth. But something else underlies the stress on inspiration in the black-interest films, which shows up in critical discussion of them as well. All these films—The Help, Red Tails, Django Unchained, even Lincoln and Glory—make a claim to public attention based partly on their social significance beyond entertainment or art, and they do so because they engage with significant moments in the history of the nexus of race and politics in the United States. There would not be so much discussion and debate and no Golden Globe, NAACP Image, or Academy Award nominations for The Help, Red Tails, or Django Unchained if those films weren’t defined partly by thematizing that nexus of race and politics in some way. The pretensions to social significance that fit these films into their particular market niche don’t conflict with the mass-market film industry’s imperative of infantilization because those pretensions are only part of the show; they are little more than empty bromides, product differentiation in the patter of “seemingly timeless ideals” which the mass entertainment industry constantly recycles. (Andrew O’Hehir observes as much about Django Unchained, which he describes as “a three-hour trailer for a movie that never happens.”7) That comes through in the defense of these films, in the face of evidence of their failings, that, after all, they are “just entertainment.” Their substantive content is ideological; it is their contribution to the naturalization of neoliberalism’s ontology as they propagandize its universalization across spatial, temporal, and social contexts. Purportedly in the interest of popular education cum entertainment, Django Unchained and The Help, and Red Tails for that matter, read the sensibilities of the present into the past by divesting the latter of its specific historicity. They reinforce the sense of the past as generic old-timey times distinguishable from the present by superficial inadequacies—outmoded fashion, technology, commodities and ideas—since overcome. In The Help Hilly’s obsession with her pet project marks segregation’s petty apartheid as irrational in part because of the expense rigorously enforcing it would require; the breadwinning husbands express their frustration with it as financially impractical. Hilly is a mean-spirited, narrow-minded person whose rigid and tone-deaf commitment to segregationist consistency not only reflects her limitations of character but also is economically unsound, a fact that further defines her, and the cartoon version of Jim Crow she represents, as irrational. The deeper message of these films, insofar as they deny the integrity of the past, is that there is no thinkable alternative to the ideological order under which we live. This message is reproduced throughout the mass entertainment industry; it shapes the normative reality even of the fantasy worlds that masquerade as escapism. Even among those who laud the supposedly cathartic effects of Django’s insurgent violence as reflecting a greater truth of abolition than passage of the Thirteenth Amendment, few commentators notice that he and Broomhilda attained their freedom through a market transaction.8 This reflects an ideological hegemony in which students all too commonly wonder why planters would deny slaves or sharecroppers education because education would have made them more productive as workers. And, tellingly, in a glowing rumination in the Daily Kos, Ryan Brooke inadvertently thrusts mass culture’s destruction of historicity into bold relief by declaiming on “the segregated society presented” in Django Unchained and babbling on—with the absurdly ill-informed and pontifical self-righteousness that the blogosphere enables—about our need to take “responsibility for preserving racial divides” if we are “to put segregation in the past and fully fulfill Dr. King’s dream.”9 It’s all an indistinguishable mush of bad stuff about racial injustice in the old-timey days. Decoupled from its moorings in a historically specific political economy, slavery becomes at bottom a problem of race relations, and, as historian Michael R. West argues forcefully, “race relations” emerged as and has remained a discourse that substitutes etiquette for equality.10 This is the context in which we should take account of what “inspiring the young” means as a justification for those films. In part, the claim to inspire is a simple platitude, more filler than substance. It is, as I’ve already noted, both an excuse for films that are cartoons made for an infantilized, generic market and an assertion of a claim to a particular niche within that market. More insidiously, though, the ease with which “inspiration of youth” rolls out in this context resonates with three related and disturbing themes: 1) underclass ideology’s narratives—now all Americans’ common sense—that link poverty and inequality most crucially to (racialized) cultural inadequacy and psychological damage; 2) the belief that racial inequality stems from prejudice, bad ideas and ignorance, and 3) the cognate of both: the neoliberal rendering of social justice as equality of opportunity, with an aspiration of creating “competitive individual minority agents who might stand a better fighting chance in the neoliberal rat race rather than a positive alternative vision of a society that eliminates the need to fight constantly against disruptive market whims in the first place.”11 This politics seeps through in the chatter about Django Unchained in particular. Erin Aubry Kaplan, in the Los Angeles Times article in which Tarantino asserts his appeal to youth, remarks that the “most disturbing detail about slavery is the emotional violence and degradation directed at blacks that effectively keeps them at the bottom of the social order, a place they still occupy today.” Writing on the Institute of the Black World blog, one Dr. Kwa David Whitaker, a 1960s-style cultural nationalist, declaims on Django’s testament to the sources of degradation and “unending servitude that has rendered black Americans almost incapable of making sound evaluations of our current situations or the kind of steps we must take to improve our condition.”12 In its blindness to political economy, this notion of black cultural or psychological damage as either a legacy of slavery or of more indirect recent origin—e.g., urban migration, crack epidemic, matriarchy, babies making babies—comports well with the reduction of slavery and Jim Crow to interpersonal dynamics and bad attitudes. It substitutes a “politics of recognition” and a patter of racial uplift for politics and underwrites a conflation of political action and therapy. With respect to the nexus of race and inequality, this discourse supports victim-blaming programs of personal rehabilitation and self-esteem engineering—inspiration—as easily as it does multiculturalist respect for difference, which, by the way, also feeds back to self-esteem engineering and inspiration as nodes within a larger political economy of race relations. Either way, this is a discourse that displaces a politics challenging social structures that reproduce inequality with concern for the feelings and characteristics of individuals and of categories of population statistics reified as singular groups that are equivalent to individuals. This discourse has made it possible (again, but more sanctimoniously this time) to characterize destruction of low-income housing as an uplift strategy for poor people; curtailment of access to public education as “choice”; being cut adrift from essential social wage protections as “empowerment”; and individual material success as socially important role modeling. Neoliberalism’s triumph is affirmed with unselfconscious clarity in the ostensibly leftist defenses of Django Unchained that center on the theme of slaves’ having liberated themselves. Trotskyists, would-be anarchists, and psychobabbling identitarians have their respective sectarian garnishes: Trotskyists see everywhere the bugbear of “bureaucratism” and mystify “self-activity;” anarchists similarly fetishize direct action and voluntarism and oppose large-scale public institutions on principle, and identitarians romanticize essentialist notions of organic, folkish authenticity under constant threat from institutions. However, all are indistinguishable from the nominally libertarian right in their disdain for government and institutionally based political action, which their common reflex is to disparage as inauthentic or corrupt.&nbsp;</p><p>Radical opposition stabilizes neoliberalism <br/>Bluhdorn, Bath politics reader, 2007<br/>(Ingolfur, “Self-description, Self-deception, Simulation: A Systems-theoretical Perspective on Contemporary Discourses of Radical Change”, Social Movement Studies, May, ebsco, ldg)</p><p>In late-modern society, this external point of reference of the increasingly all-embracing economic system is rapidly disappearing. Ever accelerated processes of societal modernization can no longer convincingly be portrayed as pursuing any idealist project of modernity. Programmes of innovation no longer serve the incremental realization of any modernist values and ideals, but are a categorical imperative of the economic system (Blu¨hdorn, 2004a, 2006b). As democratic politics turns into political marketing and is guided by the metaphysics of economic competitiveness and growth, and as late-modern individuals construct their identity primarily through consumer choices, a crisis of self referentiality descends upon late-modern society. It affects all three of the central pillars of modernity: the economy, which loses its status as serving the individual; democratic politics, which loses its status as the centre of power and the agent of the more humane future society; and the individual, which loses its status as the ultimate value and foundation of modern society (Blu¨hdorn, 2004a, b, 2006a). Indeed, the attempt to disguise its self-referentiality has become a main preoccupation of late-modern society. The regeneration of difference, the stabilization of the dualisms of modernity, has become a major concern that Baudrillard aptly describes as ‘the characteristic hysteria of our time’ (2001, p. 183). Not coincidentally, the economy has never been more anxious to emphasize that it is serving the community and investing in people. And not coincidentally politicians and their parties have never been more concerned to convince the increasingly sceptical electorate that they do listen to the people, that they still have visions, projects and agency, and that it is worth voting for them. More than anything, the stabilization of the dualisms of modernity implies the stabilization of the Self that was once conceptualized as an autonomous entity (subject) vis-a`-vis the system, but that has in each of its activities and dimensions incrementally been permeated by the market. The stabilization or regeneration of the Self is a project that is equally vital for the economy which cannot function as an end in itself, for democratic politics that needs to provide evidence that it is working towards the implementation of ideals that are rooted in the Self, and for the contemporary individual that has learnt to consider itself as the ultimate purpose (the subject) of societal development rather than a (human) resource waiting to be exploited. In late-modern society, however, this stabilization of the vanishing Self can be achieved only through the stabilization and further development of the established patterns of consumption. As the market has colonized every niche of the individual’s life world, and as every human decision and activity is becoming a matter of product choices, alternative forms of identity construction and self-experience are neither easily available nor particularly attractive. Yet the established patterns of self-construction, which thus have to be defended and further developed at any price, have fundamental problems attached to them: ?rstly, the attempt to constitute, on the basis of product choices and acts of consumption, a Self and identity that are distinct from and autonomous vis-a`-vis the market is a contradiction in terms. Secondly, late-modern society’s established patterns of consumption are known to be socially exclusive and environmentally destructive. Despite all hopes for ecological modernization and revolutionary improvements in resource ef?ciency (e.g. Weizsa¨cker et al., 1998; Hawkenet al., 1999; Lomborg, 2001), physical environmental limits imply that the lifestyles and established patterns of consumption cherished by advanced modern societies cannot even be extended to all residents of the richest countries, let alone to the populations of the developing world. For the sake of the (re)construction of an ever elusive Self, in their struggle against self-referentiality and in pursuit of the regeneration of difference, late-modern societies are thus locked into the imperative of maintaining and further developing the principle of exclusion (Blu¨hdorn, 2002, 2003). At any price they have to, and indeed do, defend a lifestyle that requires ever increasing social inequality, environmental degradation, predatory resource wars, and the tight policing of potential internal and external enemies.14 For this effort, military and surveillance technology provide ever more sophisticated and ef?cient means. Nevertheless, the principle of exclusion is ultimately still unsustainable, not only because of spiralling ‘security’ expenses but also because it directly contradicts the modernist notion of the free and autonomous individual that late-modern society desperately aims to sustain. For this reason, late-modern society is confronted with the task of having to sustain both the late-modern principle of exclusion as well as its opposite, i.e. the modernist principle of inclusion. Very importantly, the con?ict between the principles of exclusion and inclusion is not simply one between different individuals, political actors or sections of society. Instead, it is a politically irresolvable con?ict that resides right within the late-modern individual, the late-modern economy and late-modern politics. And if, as Touraine notes, late-modern society no longer believes in nor even desires political transcendence, the particular challenge is that the two principles can also no longer be attributed to different dimensions of time, i.e. the former to the present, and the latter to some future society. Instead, late-modern society needs to represent and reproduce itself and its opposite at the same time. If considered within this framework of this analysis, the function of Luhmann’s system of protest communication, or in the terms of this article, the signi?cance of late-modern societies’ discourses of radical change becomes immediately evident. At a stage when the possibility and desirability of transcending the principle of exclusion has been pulled into radical doubt but when, at the same time, the principle of inclusion is vitally important, these discourses simulate the validity of the latter as a social ideal. In other words, latemodern society reconciles the tension between the cherished but exclusive status quo – for which there is no alternative – and the non-existent inclusive alternative – on whose existence it depends – by means of simulation. The analysis of Luhmann’s work has demonstrated how the societal self-descriptions produced by the system of protest communication, or late-modern society’s discourses of radical change, ful?l this function exactly. They are an indispensable function system not so much because they help to resolve late-modern society’s problems of mal-coordination, but because by performing the possibility of the alternative they help to cope with the fundamental problem of self-referentiality. In this sense, late-modern society’s discourses of sustainability, democratic renewal, social inclusion or global justice, to name but a few, suggest that advanced modern society is working towards an environmentally and socially inclusive alternative – genuinely modern – society, but they do not deny the fact that the big utopia and project of late-modern society is the reproduction and further enhancement of the status quo, i.e. the sustainability of the principle of exclusion. Protest movements as networks of physical actors and actions complement the purely communicative discourses of radical change in that they bring their narrative and societal selfdescription to life. Whilst the declarations of institutionalized mainstream politics cannot escape the generalized suspicion that they are purely rhetorical, social movements provide an arena for the physical expression and experience of the authenticity and reality of the alternative, or at least of the reality of its possibility and the authenticity of the commitment to its realization. For late-modern individuals who seek to find their elusive identity in ever new acts of consumption, protest movements offer an opportunity to experience themselves as autonomous, as subjects, as actors, as distinct from and opposed to the all-embracing market. Social movements and the more or less institutionalized discourses of radical change thus transmute from germ cells of the alternative society into reserves of alterity, or theme-parks for simulated alterity (Blu¨hdorn, 2005a). This interpretation reflects Luhmann’s suggestion that contemporary discourses of radical change are not so much about the actual implementation of radical social change as about the ‘symbolism of the alternative’. And it nowappears that the societal self-descriptions they generate fulfil a vital function not in so far as they increase the reflexivity of late-modern society but in so far as they are arenas for the experience of simulated subjectivity, duality and modernity. They provide an opportunity to reconcile the cherished but exclusive status quo with the equally cherished but unsustainable belief in the inclusive alternative. Protest movements and discourses of radical change are the implantation of the alternative into the system itself, or the simulated reproduction of alterity fromthe system’s own resources. As the real alternatives to the system are utterly unattractive, disappearing fast, and indeed resisted and annihilated at any price, this internal simulation of alterity is becoming late-modern society’s only remaining way of coping with the threat of self-referentiality. <br/>Neoliberalism prioritizes short term profit over the well-being of environment and human life-makes extinction inevitable <br/>Nhanenge, South Africa development studies masters, 2007<br/>(Jytte, “Ecofeminsm: Towards Integrating The Concerns Of Women, Poor People And Nature Into Development”, February, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://uir.unisa.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10500/570/dissertation.pdf?sequence=1  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://uir.unisa.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10500/570/dissertation.pdf?sequence=1%27" tppabs="http://uir.unisa.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10500/570/dissertation.pdf?sequence=1"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://uir.unisa.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10500/570/dissertation.pdf?sequence=1</span></a></span>, DOA: 7-4-12)<br/>Generation of wealth was an important part of the Scientific Revolution and its modern society. The scientific discipline of economics therefore became a significant means for wealth creation. However, since it is founded on similar dualised premises as science, also economics became a system of domination and exploitation of women, Others and nature. The following discussion is intended to show that. The way in which economics, with its priority on masculine forces, becomes dominant relates to web-like, inter-connected and complex processes, which are not always clearly perceived. The below discussions try to show how the dualised priority of the individual over society, reason over emotion, self-interest over community-interest, competition over cooperation, and more pairs, generate domination that leads to the four crises of violence and war, poverty, human oppression and environmental degradation. The aim in sum is to show how the current perspective of economics is destroying society (women and Others) and nature. The following discussion is consequently a critique of economics. It is meant to highlight some elements that make economics a dominant ideology, rather than a system of knowledge. It adopts a feministic view and it is therefore seen from the side of women, poor people and nature. The critique is extensive, but not exhaustive. It is extensive because economics is the single most important tool used by mainstream institutions for development in the South. Thus if we want to understand why development does not alleviate poverty, then we first need to comprehend why its main instrument, economics, cannot alleviate poverty. A critical analysis of economics and its influence in development is therefore important as an introduction to next chapter, which discusses ecofeminism and development. However, the critique is not exhaustive because it focuses only on the dualised elements in economics. It is highly likely that there are many more critical issues in economics, which should be analyzed in addition to the below mentioned. However, it would exceed this scope. Each of the following 10 sections discusses a specific issue in economics that relates to its dualised nature. Thus, each can as such be read on its own. However, all sections are systemically interconnected. Therefore each re-enforces the others and integrated, they are meant to show the web of masculine forces that make economics dominant towards women, Others and nature. The first three sections intend to show that economics sees itself as a neutral, objective, quantitative and universal science, which does not need to be integrated in social and natural reality. The outcome of this is, however, that economics cannot value social and environmental needs. Hence, a few individuals become very rich from capitalising on free social and natural resources, while the health of the public and the environment is degraded. It also is shown that the exaggerated focus on monetary wealth does not increase human happiness. It rather leads to a deteriorating quality of life. Thus, the false belief in eternal economic growth may eventually destroy life on planet Earth. The next section shows that economics is based on dualism, with a focus solely on yang forces. This has serious consequences for all yin issues: For example, the priority on individualism over community may in its extreme form lead to self-destruction. Similarly, the priority on rationality while excluding human emotions may end in greed, domination, poverty, violence and war. The next section is important as a means to understanding "rational" economics. Its aim is to clarify the psychological meaning of money. In reality, reason and emotion are interrelated parts of the human mind; they cannot be separated. Thus, economic "rationality" and its focus on eternal wealth generation are based on personal emotions like fears and inadequacies, rather than reason. The false belief in dualism means that human beings are lying to themselves, which results in disturbed minds, stupid actions with disastrous consequences. The focus on masculine forces is consequently psychologically unhealthy; it leads to domination of society and nature, and will eventually destroy the world. The following three sections are intending to show that the new global capitalism is doing just that. First, the neo-liberal economical scheme is presented. Secondly, its application in the Third World as Structural Adjustment Programmes and as the New Economic Partnership for African Development is critiqued. Thirdly, the extreme application of the disturbed "rational" human mind, manifested in the form of an institutional psychopath "the corporation", is discussed. After concluding that economics is a patriarchal system of domination, alternative economic models, which can support women, Others and nature, are presented.&nbsp;</p><p>Their use of the ballot as a mode of resistance model is palliative and reaffirms the foundations of neoliberal ontology by valorizing a narrative of an individual overcoming oppression against all odds outside of state policy---their 1AC can easy be a sequel to atlas shrugged. <br/>Reed, Pennsylvania political science professor specializing in race and American politics, 2013<br/>(Adolph, “Django Unchained, or, The Help: How “Cultural Politics” Is Worse Than No Politics at All, and Why”, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://nonsite.org/feature/django-unchained-or-the-help-how-cultural-politics-is-worse-than-no-politics-at-all-and-why)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://nonsite.org/feature/django-unchained-or-the-help-how-cultural-politics-is-worse-than-no-politics-at-all-and-why)%27" tppabs="http://nonsite.org/feature/django-unchained-or-the-help-how-cultural-politics-is-worse-than-no-politics-at-all-and-why)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://nonsite.org/feature/django-unchained-or-the-help-how-cultural-politics-is-worse-than-no-politics-at-all-and-why)</span></a></span><br/>In addition to knee-jerk anti-statism, the objection that the slaves freed themselves, as it shows up in favorable comparison of Django Unchained to Lincoln, stems from a racial pietism that issued from the unholy union of cultural studies and black studies in the university. More than twenty years of “resistance” studies that find again and again, at this point ritualistically, that oppressed people have and express agency have contributed to undermining the idea of politics as a discrete sphere of activity directed toward the outward-looking project of affecting the social order, most effectively through creating, challenging or redefining institutions that anchor collective action with the objective of developing and wielding power. Instead, the notion has been largely evacuated of specific content at all. “Politics” can refer to whatever one wants it to; all that’s required is an act of will in making a claim. The fact that there has been no serious left presence with any political capacity in this country for at least a generation has exacerbated this problem. In the absence of dynamic movements that cohere around affirmative visions for making the society better, on the order of, say, Franklin Roosevelt’s 1944 “Second Bill of Rights,” and that organize and agitate around programs instrumental to pursuit of such visions, what remains is the fossil record of past movements—the still photo legacies of their public events, postures, and outcomes. Over time, the idea that a “left” is defined by commitment to a vision of social transformation and substantive program for realizing it has receded from cultural memory. Being on the left has become instead a posture, an identity, utterly disconnected from any specific practical commitments. Thus star Maggie Gyllenhaal and director Daniel Barnz defended themselves against complaints about their complicity in the hideously anti-union propaganda film Won’t Back Down by adducing their identities as progressives. Gyllenhaal insisted that the movie couldn’t be anti-union because “There’s no world in which I would ever, EVER make an anti-union movie. My parents are left of Trotsky.”15 Barnz took a similar tack: “I’m a liberal Democrat, very pro-union, a member of two unions. I marched with my union a couple of years ago when we were on strike.”16 And Kathryn Bigelow similarly has countered criticism that her Zero Dark Thirty justifies torture and American militarism more broadly by invoking her identity as “a lifelong pacifist.”17 Being a progressive is now more a matter of how one thinks about oneself than what one stands for or does in the world. The best that can be said for that perspective is that it registers acquiescence in defeat. It amounts to an effort to salvage an idea of a left by reformulating it as a sensibility within neoliberalism rather than a challenge to it. Gyllenhaal, Barnz, and Bigelow exemplify the power of ideology as a mechanism that harmonizes the principles one likes to believe one holds with what advances one’s material interests; they also attest to the fact that the transmutation of leftism into pure self-image exponentially increases the potential power of that function of ideology. Upton Sinclair’s quip—“It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it”—takes on all the more force when applied not merely to actions or interpretations of an external world but to devoutly savored self-perception as well. That left political imagination now operates unself-consciously within the practical ontology of neoliberalism is also the most important lesson to be drawn from progressives’ discussion of Django Unchained and, especially, the move to compare it with Lincoln. Jon Wiener, writing in The Nation, renders the following comparisons: “In Spielberg’s film, the leading black female character is a humble seamstress in the White House whose eyes fill with tears of gratitude when Congress votes to abolish slavery. In Tarantino’s film, the leading female character (Kerry Washington) is a defiant slave who has been branded on the face as a punishment for running away, and is forced—by Leonardo DiCaprio—to work as a prostitute. In Spielberg’s film, old white men make history, and black people thank them for giving them their freedom. In Tarantino’s, a black gunslinger goes after the white slavemaster with homicidal vengeance.”18 Never mind that, for what it’s worth, Kerry Washington’s character, as she actually appears in the film, is mainly a cipher, a simpering damsel in distress more reminiscent of Fay Wray in the original King Kong than heroines of the blaxploitation era’s eponymous vehicles Coffy or Foxy Brown. More problematically, Wiener’s juxtapositions reproduce the elevation of private, voluntarist action as a politics—somehow more truly true or authentic, or at least more appealing emotionally—over the machinations of government and institutional actors. That is a default presumption of the identitarian/culturalist left and is also a cornerstone of neoliberalism’s practical ontology. In an essay on Lincoln published a month earlier, Wiener identifies as the central failing of the film its dedication “to the proposition that Lincoln freed the slaves” and concludes, after considerable meandering and nit-picking ambivalence that brings the term pettifoggery to mind, “slavery died as a result of the actions of former slaves.”19 This either/or construct is both historically false and wrong-headed, and it is especially surprising that a professional historian like Wiener embraces it. The claim that slaves’ actions were responsible for the death of slavery is not only inaccurate; it is a pointless and counterproductive misrepresentation. What purpose is served by denying the significance of the four years of war and actions of the national government of the United States in ending slavery? Besides, it was indeed the Thirteenth Amendment that abolished slavery. Slaves’ mass departure from plantations was self-emancipation, by definition. Their doing so weakened the southern economy and undermined the secessionists’ capacity to fight, and the related infusion of black troops into the Union army provided a tremendous lift both on the battlefield and for northern morale. How does noting that proximity of Union troops greatly emboldened that self-emancipation diminish the import of their actions? But it was nonetheless the Thirteenth Amendment that finally outlawed slavery once and for all in the United States and provided a legal basis for preempting efforts to reinstate it in effect. Moreover, for all the debate concerning Lincoln’s motives, the sincerity of his commitment to emancipation, and his personal views of blacks, and notwithstanding its technical limits with respect to enforceability, the Emancipation Proclamation emboldened black people, slave and free, and encouraged all slavery’s opponents. And, as Wiener notes himself, the proclamation tied the war explicitly to the elimination of slavery as a system. Firefly, or The Road to Serfdom So why is a tale about a manumitted slave/homicidal black gunslinger more palatable to a contemporary leftoid sensibility than either a similarly cartoonish one about black maids and their white employers or one that thematizes Lincoln’s effort to push the Thirteenth Amendment through the House of Representatives? The answer is, to quote the saccharine 1970s ballad, “Feelings, nothing more than feelings.” Wiener’s juxtapositions reflect the political common sense that gives pride of place to demonstrations of respect for the “voices” of the oppressed and recognition of their suffering, agency, and accomplishments. That common sense informs the proposition that providing inspiration has social or political significance. But it equally shapes the generic human-interest “message” of films like The Help that represent injustice as an issue of human relations—the alchemy that promises to reconcile social justice and capitalist class power as a win/win for everyone by means of attitude adjustments and deepened mutual understanding. That common sense underwrites the tendency to reduce the past to a storehouse of encouraging post-it messages for the present. It must, because the presumption that the crucial stakes of political action concern recognition and respect for the oppressed’s voices is a presentist view, and mining the past to reinforce it requires anachronism. The large struggles against slavery and Jim Crow were directed toward altering structured patterns of social relations anchored in law and state power, but stories of that sort are incompatible with both global marketing imperatives and the ideological predilections of neoliberalism and its identitarian loyal opposition. One can only shudder at the prospect of how Gillo Pontecorvo’s 1966 film, The Battle of Algiers, or Costa-Gavras’s State of Siege (1972) would be remade today. (Guy Ritchie’s and Madonna’s execrable 2002 remake of Lina Wertmüller’s 1974 film Swept Away may provide a clue; their abomination completely erases the original film’s complex class and political content and replaces it with a banal—aka “universal”—story of an encounter between an older woman and a younger man, while at the same time meticulously, almost eerily, reproducing, scene by scene, the visual structure of Wertmüller’s film.) Particularly as those messages strive for “universality” as well as inspiration, their least common denominator tends toward the generic story of individual triumph over adversity. But the imagery of the individual overcoming odds to achieve fame, success, or recognition also maps onto the fantasy of limitless upward mobility for enterprising and persistent individuals who persevere and remain true to their dreams. As such, it is neoliberalism’s version of an ideal of social justice, legitimizing both success and failure as products of individual character. When combined with a multiculturalist rhetoric of “difference” that reifies as autonomous cultures—in effect racializes—what are actually contingent modes of life reproduced by structural inequalities, this fantasy crowds inequality as a metric of injustice out of the picture entirely. This accounts for the popularity of reactionary dreck like Beasts of the Southern Wild among people who should know better. The denizens of the Bathtub actively, even militantly, choose their poverty and cherish it and should be respected and appreciated for doing so. But no one ever supposed that Leni Riefenstahl was on the left. The tale type of individual overcoming has become a script into which the great social struggles of the last century and a half have commonly been reformulated to fit the requirements of a wan, gestural multiculturalism. Those movements have been condensed into the personae of Great Men and Great Women—Booker T. Washington, W. E. B. Du Bois, Rosa Parks, Malcolm X, George Washington Carver, Martin Luther King, Jr., Harriet Tubman, Frederick Douglass, Ella Baker, Fannie Lou Hamer and others—who seem to have changed the society apparently by virtue of manifesting their own greatness. The different jacket photos adorning the 1982 and 1999 editions of Doug McAdam’s well known sociological study of the civil rights movement, Political Process and the Development of Black Insurgency, 1930-1970, exemplify the shift. The first edition’s cover was a photo of an anonymous group of marching protesters; the second edition featured the (staged) photo—made iconic by its use in an Apple advertising campaign—of a dignified Rosa Parks sitting alone on the front seat of a bus looking pensively out the window.20 Ironically, the scholarly turn away from organizations and institutional processes to valorize instead the local and everyday dimensions of those movements may have exacerbated this tendency by encouraging a focus on previously unrecognized individual figures and celebrating their lives and “contributions.” Rather than challenging the presumption that consequential social change is made by the will of extraordinary individuals, however, this scholarship in effect validates it by inflating the currency of Greatness so much that it can be found any and everywhere. Giving props to the unrecognized or underappreciated has become a feature particularly of that scholarship that defines scholarly production as a terrain of political action in itself and aspires to the function of the “public intellectual.” A perusal of the rosters of African American History Month and Martin Luther King, Jr. Day speakers at any random sample of colleges and universities attests to how closely this scholar/activist turn harmonizes with the reductionist individualism of prosperity religion and the varieties of latter-day mind cure through which much of the professional-managerial stratum of all races, genders, and sexual orientations, narrates its understandings of the world.<br/>The Roll of the ballot is to vote for the team that best presents a collective challenge to institutionalized neoliberalism.

This seems dif­fi­cult to ac­cept for many people on the left.<br/>Jodi Dean (‘JD’): There are a couple of reasons why I take this po­s­i­tion. First, and most broadly, democracy is not a category of contestation anymore. Right and left agree on democracy and use a democratic rhetoric to justify their positions. George Bush claimed to be de­fending demo­cracy all over the world by bombing all sorts of people. If that is demo­cracy, then that is not a lan­guage that the left can use to formulate an egalitarian and emancipatory potential or hope. A second reason, which is a re­per­cus­sion of the first one, is that democracy is a kind of ambient milieu, it’s the air we breathe, everything is put in terms of democracy nowadays. And this relates to the third reason: the rhetoric of democracy is particularly strong now in the way in which it is combined with the form of cap­it­alism I call ‘communicative capitalism’, where ideals of inclusion and participation, of making one’s voice heard and one’s opinion known are also used by TMobile and Apple. Participation ends up being the answer to everything. If that’s the case, referring to it is not making a cut with our dominant frame, it’s just reinforcing it. If gov­ern­ments and cor­por­a­tions are en­cour­aging one to par­ti­cipate then left­ists don’t add one thing that’s not already present if they say that what we need is to make sure that everyone is par­ti­cip­ating and in­cluded?—?that’s already what we have. For the left to be able to make a break we have to speak a language that is not already the one we’re in.<br/>BandC: This sounds primarily like a stra­tegic or polit­ical reason for shifting the focus away from demo­cracy. But is there really some­thing fun­da­ment­ally wrong on a the­or­et­ical level with the more rad­ical no­tion of democracy?<br/>JD: What’s wrong with the notion of democracy as even radical democrats have appropriated it is that it leaves cap­it­alism in place. The assumption is that if we have enough demo­cracy the problem of cap­it­alism will either go away or solve it­self?—?and that’s clearly false. Take Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe: their idea of radical democracy is framed specifically to keep class from being a primary polit­ical de­term­in­a­tion. In the Frankfurt School tra­di­tion Habermas’s dis­tinc­tion between life-world and system leaves cap­it­alism un­touched. The same is true for the focus on civil so­ciety which leaves the mode of pro­duc­tion out of the frame. So the the­or­et­ical reason for my skep­ti­cism is that the left has moved away from an ana­lysis and cri­tique of capitalism<br/>BandC: You refer to demo­cracy as a ‘neo­lib­eral fantasy’?—?could you ex­plain that no­tion a bit?<br/>JD: The more neo-liberalism has entrenched itself the more we have been hearing this lan­guage of democracy, as if participation was going to solve all problems?—?but this is a fantasy be­cause the fun­da­mental truth is that it is not going to solve these prob­lems. Keeping all the activity in the demo­cratic sphere makes it seem as if people are busy, en­gaged etc. without ever af­fecting the basic struc­ture. It’s a fantasy be­cause it func­tions like a screen.<br/>BandC: Building on this dia­gnosis, you in­tro­duce an al­tern­ative vocab­u­lary with the term ‘com­munism’ at its center?—?a dif­fi­cult term, one could say, if only for stra­tegic pur­poses given that it is widely re­garded as his­tor­ic­ally discredited.<br/>JD: First, there has been the re­turn of com­munism in the the­or­et­ical dis­cus­sion that started with the con­fer­ences Slavoj Zizek and Alain Badiou have or­gan­ized. Hardt and Negri have been talking about com­munism for a long time already. It’s im­portant to re­turn to the lan­guage of com­munism be­cause that is the one word that says ‘no to cap­it­alism’. No matter what, if people say that they are com­munist, you know that they are against private prop­erty and the private own­er­ship of the means of pro­duc­tion and for the people’s con­trol over these means. There’s no nu­ance about their re­la­tion to cap­it­alism, and that’s what is im­portant. A third reason is that the right in the US still be­lieves in it, they are con­stantly at­tacking com­munism which means that they know that it is the lan­guage of anti-capitalism that ap­peals to some kind of eman­cip­atory egal­it­ari­anism. So I don’t think that com­munism is as dead as the left seems to as­sume. The right knows it’s alive.<br/>BandC: This might of course be spe­cific to the US and a bit dif­ferent in Europe. But let’s turn to a more the­or­et­ical con­cern. We agree that the ana­lysis of cap­it­alism, and more gen­er­ally a Marxist per­spective on class so­ciety, is ab­so­lutely cru­cial and that this has been neg­lected or mar­gin­al­ized in a lot of radical-democratic thought. But on the other hand it seems that the return to com­munism, e.g. in the work of Badiou, is also in a prob­lem­atic way de­tached from a social-theoretical ana­lysis of so­ciety. The effect is that communism is understood in activist or voluntarist terms, as if we could just de­cide to es­tab­lish com­munism, whereas in the Marxist frame­work it was al­ways tied to both a socio-theoretical ana­lysis and to ex­isting eman­cip­atory move­ments. Does com­munism re­turn as utopia in­stead of real movement?<br/>JD: I don’t think this de­tach­ment is so char­ac­ter­istic of the re­turn of com­munism. It’s true that Badiou lacks any ac­count of the eco­nomy, but David Harvey has a strong Marxist ana­lysis of the eco­nomy that re­cog­nizes changes, such as the emer­gence of new places of struggle and or­gan­iz­a­tion such as the city. So here there is a socio-economic an­chor and com­munism is not seen as free-floating. The same is true for Hardt and Negri, par­tic­u­larly in Empire their ac­count, which goes back to the whole post-autonomia dis­cus­sion and its ana­lysis of the so­cial factory, re­cog­nizes that there are socio-economic changes and move­ments that can still be ana­lyzed with vari­ations of Marxist cat­egories and provide a loc­a­tion for some kind of com­munist move­ment. Another ques­tion is whether there is an active, vivid communist movement right now. That would probably be far-fetched with regard to the US and Germany or the Netherlands?—?but look at other parts of the world such as Nepal and India or Greece. We go too quickly if we say that there is no social analysis or link with any real movements.<br/>BandC: What about Occupy? Do you see a pos­sible link with the re­turn to com­munism or is it a demo­cratic movement?<br/>JD: It’s a plural and open move­ment with mul­tiple tendencies.<br/>BandC: That sounds like com­mu­nic­ative capitalism!<br/>JD: You’re right, that’s a problem, and one of the views I often argue against is that Occupy is a ‘meme’ that jumped from the in­ternet onto the streets or that it’s primarily driven by so­cial media. I don’t think this is true. What made the move­ment work in the US was the re­la­tion to Wall Street, it wasn’t Occupy Capitol or Congress. That gives us the an­ti­cap­it­alist core that is the sub­stance of the move­ment even as all the other tend­en­cies some­times make us lose sight of that.<br/>BandC: Can you say some­thing about the in­sti­tu­tional or or­gan­iz­a­tional struc­tures that the move­ment against cap­it­alism and for com­munism would have to have? You argue that we have to renew the idea of the party. Many will re­gard that with some skepticism!<br/>JD: First on the idea of the party. Lukács is really great in his book Lenin: A Study on the Unicity of his Thought in re­cog­nizing that the party is a form for the ac­tu­ality of re­volu­tion, which means that it is a form that we need be­cause of the mul­ti­pli­city of people who be­come mo­bil­ized when a move­ment starts. Of course, they are going to bring all kinds of dif­ferent forms of con­scious­ness to the move­ment and that can easily be re­dir­ected and be­come a kind of pop­u­lism. So a party can be useful in trying to re­spond to this?—?not dog­mat­ic­ally but flex­ibly, trying to push and steer a little bit. But it should not and cannot get ahead of the people. It has to have a much more re­sponsive re­la­tion­ship to it, trying to direct in a re­sponsive way. So with re­gard to the first ques­tion I think that a party is ne­ces­sary and that we can re­cog­nize even in the old his­tory of Communist parties it was never as dog­matic, un­re­sponsive or rigid as the critics want us to think. Second, not a whole lot of people are ex­cited about the party idea; I’ll admit to that. But I think the ex­per­i­ence of Syriza can be made more in­spiring for people out­side of Greece. Because they see that there is a flex­ible left co­ali­tion that was able within four or five months to func­tion as a party and make real pro­gress. That would be different in the United States because we do not have a parliamentary system, so the incentives for the party form are not really there, which is a real problem. On the other hand, one of the experiences that has come out of ‘Occupy’ is that there needs to be a more explicit understanding of how leaders func­tion and arise so that leaders can be accountable and different people can move in and out of leadership positions, in an open, trans­parent and ac­count­able way. So I would hope that over the next year some more co­hesive or­gan­iz­a­tional form can emerge and I do not think that it hurts to call it a party.<br/>BandC: Historically the role that Communist parties have played has often turned out to be anti-revolutionary not only with re­spect to e.g. the more an­archist cur­rents in these re­volu­tionary move­ments but also in other ways. One might think that the council system would be a good al­tern­ative to the party form in terms of or­gan­izing the movement.<br/>JD: I don’t think that the party form is op­posed to coun­cils, cells or so­viets. In October, I was reading Lenin’s April Theses and thought that the gen­eral as­sem­blies of Occupy are a new form of so­viet. All of these are units in which a party can func­tion or which can be com­pon­ents of a party. They are not op­posed to each other. I think Anarchists are too re­ductive here be­cause they treat the party as some­thing on top rather than some­thing within: an or­gan­iz­a­tion of voices within a broader field. I think it is a mis­take to build up this dichotomy.<br/>BandC: But there do seem to be his­tor­ical and so­ci­olo­gical reasons to be skeptical.<br/>JD: There have been mul­tiple kinds of parties. Even in the Soviet Union the party changed over time. It went from being a re­volu­tionary party with mul­tiple splits to one that be­came less tol­erant of vocal op­pos­i­tion within it to one that was a ruling bur­eau­cratic party to a bur­eau­cratic party that would also purge it­self and change over time. People act like freaks when it comes to Communism and in­stall a nar­row­ness and a de­term­inism that would be ana­thema in any other in­tel­lec­tual dis­cus­sion. I think it is really time to get out of that Cold War men­tality that lets us re­duce everything to one kind of bur­eau­cratic Stalinist party as if that were the only thing that a Communist party ever was.<br/>BandC: Let us come back to the Occupy Movement once more. Maybe you could elab­orate a little more on where you see the sig­ni­fic­ance of the movement.<br/>JD: The most im­portant thing about Occupy Wall Street is that it let the Left recognize itself as a Left again instead of speaking in terms of all these different identity categories splitting the Left and saying ad nauseum that there is no Left and that no one can say ‘we’. With Occupy Wall Street we can fi­nally say ‘we’ again. It really was a situ­ation where the ques­tion was: ‘are you for or against Occupy Wall Street?’ And people from a wide variety of po­s­i­tions on the Left ended up having to say, ‘Yes, we are for it’. Even if their accept­ance was qualified or critical, that ‘for or against’ became a dividing line. Occupy is an event partly be­cause of its ability to in­scribe this kind of di­vi­sion so people have to say whether they are for or against it: ‘Are you one of us or not?’?—?even if the ‘us’ is amorphous, chan­ging and plural. But it was a really di­visive mo­ment in the very best pos­sible way. So first, its sig­ni­fic­ance lies in the way it gal­van­ized the Left. Naomi Klein said at the end of the first week of the oc­cu­pa­tion: ‘This is the most ex­citing thing in the world right now’, meaning for us in the US Left to have some­thing that was gal­van­izing and that was an opening. That is what I think of Occupy Wall Street as an evental form. I also think it is a polit­ical or­gan­iz­a­tion of the in­com­pat­ib­ility of cap­it­alism and demo­cracy. Its par­tic­ular form ties it to the con­tent of the gap between cap­it­alism and democracy.<br/>BandC: One of the main cri­ti­cisms re­garding strategy that have been made is the ab­sence of an agenda or a set of demands.<br/>JD: I was in the Demands Working Group, which died a really hor­rible death. It was about March and it was hor­rible to watch as it was painful and on­going. The problem of de­mands was ini­tially presented as if it wasn’t a problem but a choice: ‘We do not want to have demands because we are not addressing the state. Occupation is its own de­mand.’ But this was an unbelievably stupid thing to say because the reality was that the movement at its beginning was so inclusive and amorphous that it was not capable of making demands as a group. There was not enough of any kind of so­cial co­he­sion, any kind of common in­terest, from which de­mands could be for­mu­lated. Instead of ad­dressing that, the dis­cus­sion was formed around ‘de­mands are bad; any­body who wants us to make de­mands is trying to hi­jack the move­ment or elim­inate its potential.’<br/>But what was also exciting about it initially was that not having demands created a space of desire so that the main­stream media and politicians went nuts. Everybody wanted to know: ‘What do they want?’ It was a wonderful proof of the truth of Lacanian theory’s ac­count of the gap of desire. There was this gap and it did incite a lot of enthusiasm and desire and that was good. It was ob­vi­ously not planned but there was an im­mense be­nefit to that open­ness. By early November, though, the demands group was frag­menting, the more lib­eral and in­de­pendent mem­bers would take everything that the rest said and would red-bait it and say: ‘You guys are com­mun­ists; this will never wash with the 99.’ And be­cause of the Anarchist prin­ciples of con­sensus that re­quired full or close to full agree­ment, they were able to block pro­posals nearly all the time. Other people were in the group con­stantly saying that the group should not exist and also blocking de­cisions. So that was a problem.<br/>BandC: You said that Occupy en­abled the Left to say ‘we’ again. But isn’t one of the big achieve­ments of the his­tor­ical Left that it was al­ways wary of saying ‘we’ be­cause it was aware of the ex­clu­sions res­ulting from such a ‘we’? Is this aware­ness in­cor­por­ated into the move­ment and what are mech­an­isms ex­pressing it? How can we re­flect on these more prob­lem­atic as­pects of the ‘we’?<br/>JD: First, there is a very concrete procedure for dealing with the potential problems of an exclusive ‘we’ that is called the ‘progressive stack’. If people want to speak in a general assembly they get ‘on stack’. The progressive stack makes sure that people who have not spoken and/or are from historically disadvantaged or marginalized groups are moved up in the stack. That makes it impossible for privileged people to take up all the speaking time. Most working groups also ad­opted this mech­anism. Secondly, there were multiple groups that were focused on women in the movement, racial differences, problems and issues for the undocumented etc. So there were par­tic­ular caucuses and working groups on these very topics. So there was always self-consciousness in the movement. The assump­tion that every­body just forgot fifty years of dif­fer­ence theory is ludicrous.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>2nc<br/>K<br/>K prior <br/>The driving course of the Filipino economy is nurses they train to send to other contries, a legacy of colonialism has drained their natural resources which locks them into a detrimental hierarchical relationship with other counties.

Granted, the images projected from the Superdome, the convention center, overpasses, and rooftops seemed to cry out a stark statement of racial inequality. But that’s partly because in the contemporary U.S., race is the most familiar language of inequality or injustice. It’s what we see partly because it’s what we’re accustomed to seeing, what we look for. As I argued in The Nation, class—as income, wealth, and access to material resources, including a safety net of social connections—was certainly a better predictor than race of who evacuated the city before the hurricane, who was able to survive the storm itself, who was warehoused in the Superdome or convention center or stuck without food and water on the parched overpasses, who is marooned in shelters in Houston or elsewhere, and whose interests will be factored into the reconstruction of the city, who will be able to return. New Orleans is a predominantly black city, and it is a largely poor city. The black population is disproportionately poor, and the poor population is disproportionately black. It is not surprising that those who were stranded and forgotten, probably those who died, were conspicuously black and poor. None of that, however, means that race—or even racism —is adequate as an explanation of those patterns of inequality. And race is especially useless as a basis on which to craft a politics that can effectively pursue social justice. Before the “yes, buts” begin, I am not claiming that systemic inequalities in the United States are not significantly racialized. The evidence of racial disparities is far too great for any sane or honest person to deny, and they largely emerge from a history of discrimination and racial injustice. Nor am I saying that we should overlook that fact in the interest of some idealized nonracial or post-racial politics. Let me be blunter than I’ve ever been in print about what I am saying: As a political strategy, exposing racism is wrongheaded and at best an utter waste of time. It is the political equivalent of an appendix: a useless vestige of an earlier evolutionary moment that’s usually innocuous but can flare up and become harmful. There are two reasons for this judgment. One is that the language of race and racism is too imprecise to describe effectively even how patterns of injustice and inequality are racialized in a post-Jim Crow world. “Racism” can cover everything from individual prejudice and bigotry, unself-conscious perception of racial stereotypes, concerted group action to exclude or subordinate, or the results of ostensibly neutral market forces. It can be a one-word description and explanation of patterns of unequal distribution of income and wealth, services and opportunities, police brutality, a stockbroker’s inability to get a cab, neighborhood dislocation and gentrification, poverty, unfair criticism of black or Latino athletes, or being denied admission to a boutique. Because the category is so porous, it doesn’t really explain anything. Indeed, it is an alternative to explanation. Exposing racism apparently makes those who do it feel good about themselves. Doing so is cathartic, though safely so, in the same way that proclaiming one’s patriotism is in other circles. It is a summary, concluding judgment rather than a preliminary to a concrete argument. It doesn’t allow for politically significant distinctions; in fact, as a strategy, exposing racism requires subordinating the discrete features of a political situation to the overarching goal of asserting the persistence and power of racism as an abstraction. This leads to the second reason for my harsh judgment. Many liberals gravitate to the language of racism not simply because it makes them feel righteous but also because it doesn’t carry any political warrant beyond exhorting people not to be racist. In fact, it often is exactly the opposite of a call to action. Such formulations as “racism is our national disease” or similar pieties imply that racism is a natural condition. Further, it implies that most whites inevitably and immutably oppose blacks and therefore can’t be expected to align with them around common political goals. This view dovetails nicely with Democrats’ contention that the only way to win elections is to reject a social justice agenda that is stigmatized by association with blacks and appeal to an upper-income white constituency concerned exclusively with issues like abortion rights and the deficit. Upper-status liberals are more likely to have relatively secure, rewarding jobs, access to health care, adequate housing, and prospects for providing for the kids’ education, and are much less likely to be in danger of seeing their nineteen-year-old go off to Iraq. They tend, therefore, to have a higher threshold of tolerance for political compromises in the name of electing this year’s sorry pro-corporate Democrat. Acknowledging racism—and, of course, being pro-choice—is one of the few ways many of them can distinguish themselves from their Republican co-workers and relatives. As the appendix analogy suggests, insistence on understanding inequality in racial terms is a vestige of an earlier political style. The race line persists partly out of habit and partly because it connects with the material interests of those who would be race relations technicians. In this sense, race is not an alternative to class. The tendency to insist on the primacy of race itself stems from a class perspective. For roughly a generation it seemed reasonable to expect that defining inequalities in racial terms would provoke some, albeit inadequate, remedial response from the federal government. But that’s no longer the case; nor has it been for quite some time. That approach presumed a federal government that was concerned at least not to appear racially unjust. Such a government no longer exists. A key marker of the right’s victory in national politics is that the discussion of race now largely serves as a way to reinforce a message to whites that the public sector is there merely to help some combination of black, poor, and loser. Liberals have legitimized this perspective through their own racial bad faith. For many whites, the discussion of race also reinforces the idea that cutting public spending is justifiably aimed at weaning a lazy black underclass off the dole or—in the supposedly benign, liberal Democratic version—teaching them “personal responsibility.” New Orleans is instructive. The right has a built-in counter to the racism charge by mobilizing all the scurrilous racial stereotypes that it has propagated to justify attacks on social protection and government responsibility all along. Only those who already &nbsp;are inclined to believe that racism is the source of inequality accept that charge. For others, nasty victim-blaming narratives abound to explain away obvious racial disparities. What we must do, to pursue justice for displaced, impoverished New Orleanians as well as for the society as a whole, is to emphasize that their plight is a more extreme, condensed version of the precarious position of millions of Americans today, as more and more lose health care, bankruptcy protection, secure employment, afford¬able housing, civil liberties, and access to education. And their plight will be the future of many, many more people in this country once the bipartisan neoliberal consensus reduces government to a tool of corporations and the investor class alone.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>The AFF can’t turn the k---<br/>Collectivity---the AFF is structured by neoliberalism to be a private expression of agency that doesn’t undermine neoliberalism’s underlying structures-only calls for new collectivism can solve.<br/>Giroux, McMaster university Chair in English and Cultural Studies, 2005<br/>(Henry, “The Terror of Neoliberalism: Rethinking the Significance of Cultural Politics”, College Literature 32.1, proquest, ldg)<br/>Neoliberalism has indeed become a broad-based political and cultural movement designed to obliterate public concerns and liquidate the welfare state, and make politics everywhere an exclusively market-driven project (Leys 2001). But neoliberalism does more than make the market "the informing principle of politics" (Duggan 2003, 34), while allocating wealth and resources to those who are most privileged by virtue of their class, race, and power. Its supporting political culture and pedagogical practices also put into play a social universe and cultural landscape that sustain a particularly barbaric notion of authoritarianism, set in motion under the combined power of a religious and market fundamentalism and anti-terrorism laws that suspend civil liberties, incarcerate disposable populations, and provide the security forces necessary for capital to destroy those spaces where democracy can be nourished. All the while, the landscape and soundscape become increasingly homogenized through the spectacle of flags waving from every flower box, car, truck, and house, encouraged and supplemented by jingoistic bravado being broadcast by Fox Television News and Clear Channel radio stations. As a cultural politics and a form of economic domination, neoliberalism tells a very limited story, one that is antithetical to nurturing democratic identities, values, public spaces, and institutions and thereby enables fascism to grow because it has no ethical language for recognizing politics outside of the realm of the market, for controlling market excesses, or for challenging the underlying tenets of a growing authoritarianism bolstered by the pretense of religious piety. Neoliberal ideology, on the one hand, pushes for the privatization of all non-commodified public spheres and the upward distribution of wealth. On the other hand, it supports policies that increasingly militarize facets of public space in order to secure the privileges and benefits of the corporate elite and ultra-rich. Neoliberalism does not merely produce economic inequality, iniquitous power relations, and a corrupt political system; it also promotes rigid exclusions from national citizenship and civic participation. As Lisa Duggan points out, "Neoliberalism cannot be abstracted from race and gender relations, or other cultural aspects of the body politic. Its legitimating discourse, social relations, and ideology are saturated with race, with gender, with sex, with religion, with ethnicity, and nationality" (2003, xvi). Neoliberalism comfortably aligns itself with various strands of neoconservative and religious fundamentalisms waging imperial wars abroad as well as at home against those groups and movements that threaten its authoritarian misreading of the meaning of freedom, security, and productiveness. Neoliberalism has to be understood and challenged as both an economic theory and a powerful public pedagogy and cultural politics. That is, it has to be named and critically understood before it can be critiqued. The commonsense assumptions that legitimate neoliberalism's alleged historical inevitability have to be unsettled and then engaged for the social damage they cause at all levels of human existence. Such a recognition suggests identifying and critically examining the most salient and powerful ideologies that inform and frame neoliberalism. It also suggests a need on the part of progressives to make cultural politics and the notion of public pedagogy central to the struggle against neoliberalism, particularly since education and culture now play such a prominent political and economic role in both securing consent and producing capital (Peters 2002). In fact, this implies as Susan Buck-Morss has insisted that "the recognition of cultural domination as just as important as, and perhaps even as the condition of possibility of, political and economic domination is a true 'advance' in our thinking" (2003, 103). Of course, this position is meant not to disavow economic and institutional struggles but to supplement them with a cultural politics that connects symbolic power and its pedagogical practices with material relations of power. Engaging the cultural politics and economics of neoliberalism also points to the need for progressives to analyze how neoliberal policies work at the level of everyday life through the language of privatization and the lived cultural forms of class, race, gender, youth, and ethnicity. Finally, such a project must employ a language of critique and possibility, engagement and hope as part of a broader project of viewing democracy as a site of intense struggle over matters of representation, participation, and shared power. Central to the critique of neoliberalism is the belief, as Alain Touraine argues, that neoliberal globalization has not "dissolved our capacity for political action" (2001, 2). Such action depends on the ability of various groups-the peace movement, the anti-corporate globalization movement, the human rights movement, the environmental justice movement-within and across national boundaries-to form alliances in which matters of community and solidarity provide a common symbolic space and multiple public spheres where norms are created, debated, and engaged as part of an attempt to develop a new political language, culture, and set of relations. Such efforts must be understood as part of a broader attempt not only to collectively struggle against domination, but also to defend all those social advances that strengthen democratic public spheres and services, demand new rights, establish modes of power sharing, and create notions of social justice adequate to imagining and sustaining democracy on a global level. Consider, for example, the anti-corporate globalization movement's slogan "Another World is Possible!" which demands, as Alex Callinicos insightfully points out, a different kind of social logic, a powerful sense of unity and solidarity. Another world-that is, a world based on different social logic, run according to different priorities from those that prevail today. It is easy enough to specify what the desiderata of such an alternative social logic would be-social justice, economic efficiency, environmental sustainability, and democracy-but much harder to spell out how a reproducible social system embodying these requirements could be built. And then there is the question of how to achieve it. Both these questions-What is the alternative to capitalism? What strategy can get us there?-can be answered in different ways. One thing the anti-capitalist movement is going to have to learn is how to argue through the differences that exist and will probably develop around such issues without undermining the very powerful sense of unity that has been one of the movement's most attractive qualities. (Callinicos 2003, 147) Callinicos's insight suggests that any viable struggle against neoliberal capitalism will have to rethink "the entire project of politics within the changed conditions of a global public sphere, and to do this democratically, as people who speak different political languages, but whose goals are nonetheless the same: global peace, economic justice, legal equality, democratic participation, individual freedom, mutual respect" (Buck-Morss 2003, 4-5). One of the most central tasks facing intellectuals, activists, educators, and others who believe in an inclusive and substantive democracy is the need to use theory to rethink the language and possibilities of politics as a way to imagine a future outside the powerful grip of neoliberalism and the impending authoritarianism that has a different story to tell about the future, one that reinvents the past in the image of the crude exercise of power and the unleashing of unimaginable human suffering. Critical reflection and social action in this discourse must acknowledge how the category of the global public sphere extends the space of politics beyond the boundaries of local resistance. Evidence of such actions can be found in the World Social Forums that took place in 2003 in Porto Alegre, Brazil and in Hyderabad, India in 2004. Successful forms of global dissent can also be observed in the international campaign to make AIDS drugs affordable for poor countries as well as in the international demonstrations against multinational corporations in cities from Melbourne and Seattle to Genoa and New York City. New alliances among intellectuals, students, labor unions, and environmentalists are taking place in the streets of Argentina, the West Bank, and in many other places fighting globalization from above. At the same time, a new language of agency and resistance is emerging among many activists and is being translated into new approaches to what it means to make the pedagogical more political as part of a global justice movement. Politics can no longer exclude matters of social and cultural learning and reproduction in the context of globalization or ignore the ways in which, as Imre Szeman asserts, globalization itself constitutes "a problem of and for pedagogy" (2002, 4). The slogan, "Another World is Possible!" reinforces the important political insight that one cannot act otherwise unless one can think otherwise, but acting otherwise demands a new politics in which it is recognized that global problems need global solutions along with global institutions, global modes of dissent, global intellectual collaboration, and global social movements. Sidebar Under the reign of neoliberalism with its growing commercialization of everyday life, the corporatization of higher education, the dismantling of the welfare state, the militarizing of public space, and the increasing privatization of the public sphere, it has become more difficult to address not only the complex nature of social agency and the importance of democratic public spheres, but also the fact that active and critical political agents have to be formed, educated, and socialized into the world of politics. Lacking a theoretical paradigm for linking learning to social change, existing political vocabularies appear increasingly powerless about how to theorize the crisis of political agency and political pessimism in the face of neoliberal assaults on all democratic public spheres. As the vast majority of citizens become detached from public forums that nourish social critique, political agency not only becomes a mockery of itself, it is replaced by market-based driven form of cultural politics in which private satisfactions replace social responsibilities and confessional culture become a substitute for systemic change. This paper argues that in the face of a virulent neoliberalism that spawns a vast educational propaganda machine, educators, cultural workers, and others need to rethink the entire project of politics within the changed conditions of a global political/pedagogical sphere. This article attempts to address the current crisis of meaning and political agency as a fundamental challenge to educators, public intellectuals, social movements, and others who believe in the promise of global democracy. In addressing this challenge, it argues that the urgency of the times demands a notion of global politics in which pedagogy, international alliances, and new forms of solidarity play a prominent role in the call for educators and others to be able to imagine otherwise in order to act otherwise.</p><p>Return of the Commonality---the starting point of blackness ontologically grounds identity which cannot create effective negativity---blackness is defined in opposition to whiteness which places white hegemony back at the forefront of our politics.

Ironically, in an article otherwise respectful of differences, Red Maistre ends up lumping me in a category of those who draw from the work of Friedrich Nietzsche to attack identity politics. While I am no stranger to the work of Nietzsche, the notion that my critique of the politics of identity might, by association I suppose, draw from the work of Nietzsche, is ludicrous. My criticism of identity politics has nothing to do with Nietzsche’s (or anyone else’s) problem with “ressentiment” or “slave morality.” Nor do I associate subaltern identity or even identity politics with either slave morality or ressentiment. If anything, my view might be said to be a critique of identity politics for falling short of the necessary negation, for not having strong enough politics of ressentiment or negation, and rather than breaking down oppression, serving instead to reify the categories against which oppression is levied. My argument more likely draws from and is analogous to that made by Marx in his argument with the Young Hegelians in The German Ideology. Rather than a battle against religion, Marx argued, we should be engaging in a battle against the conditions that make religions necessary. That is, rather than fighting against concepts that constrain or oppress the subject’s thinking, self-image, or identity, we should be fighting against the conditions that make such concepts or ideations possible or necessary. The capitalist system has enormous capacities for reconstitution and accommodation, one day favoring this, the next that identity, and also for serving up opponents mobilized against each other in a Hobbesian war.<br/>However, contrary to what Red Maistre asserts in his piece, my argument is not against identities per se, which would be a ridiculous notion on its face. Under existing conditions, subaltern identities exist and to suggest that they simply go away is tantamount to blaming people for their own oppression. As Red Maistre points out it also suggests that subalterns as such cannot fully participate in social life. Of course, that this is the case is also part of the reason that identity politics exists in the first place.<br/>But my argument is against a politics of identity en se, a politics of identity as an end of politics, rather than as a part of an ultimate politics to overcome capitalism. My critique of identity politics is not that identities themselves must be “liquidated” before class politics can proceed apace (although I do maintain that identity represents a one-sided aspect of human potentiality and that it, like the division of labor and the class itself, must eventually be negated and overcome). Rather, my argument is that, in the meanwhile, and as stopgaps in class politics, or out of despair for the class struggle against capitalism, identities can and have been used by a politics of identity to keep class politics from even registering on the horizon of political visibility. This is not the same as suggesting that identity is ultimately an insubstantial façade that must give way in the name of class. This is to say that identity politics, that which suggests that some necessary connection subsists between class, politics and identity, can and has been used as part of diversionary tactics away from an ultimate negation of commodity relations, the class, and subordinated categories of all kinds. Identity politics obscures a commonality within difference, and elevates identity difference to a political meaning that it does not deserve. To say this is not some simple “class reductionism.” It is to descry the relations and operations of identity in connection with class, not to boil down identity into class as such. Identity, it notes, is resistant to such class subsumption. If anything, it recognizes identity at a structural level, more so than does identity politics itself.<br/>While easy, the case of Barack Obama should prove illustrative of the problems with identity politics, but not merely as a person of color who is also a member of the ruling class. Rather than mobilizing the class as a representative of an oppressed and super-exploited group within that class, as the Obama narrative suggested, Obama has served as a decoy of identity, a decoy that has been used precisely to divert change potentiality into a Democratic Party cul de sac and away from substantial politics. That is to say, identity and its rhetorics have been deployed as a substitute for a politics that grasps such identities as partss of a broader class oppression and exploitation. As in many other cases, in the case of Obama, identity politics has elevated identity to supremacy in political meaning, serving as a trompe-l’œil by suggesting that “race” has a necessary political meaning. But “race,” like other identities, has no necessary political meaning. It is thus a faulty gauge for the politics of identity group members.<br/>More broadly speaking, in fact, as Jonathan Munis and I argued after the second election of Obama, in the United States,<br/>the immediate producers have always been divided across the two-party system, and thus disunited and rendered virtually inert… The Obama coalition, as official media dubs it, has successfully maintained a vice-like grip on ethnic minority workers, as well as organized white workers. Meanwhile, the Republican Party continues to disorient unorganized white workers and rural populations more generally, on “cultural” and purported “privilege” grounds… Meanwhile, appeals in the opposite direction are made to professional and educated white liberals, who are flattered and ingratiated for their “progressive” identity politics by Obama and the Democrats, and are likewise encouraged to malign their natural class counterparts among the white working-class Republicans. This combination of self-flattery, ingratiation and denigration is precisely aimed at ruling out cross-party politics and results in the cultural and political isolation of white workers currently atomized and co-opted by rightist nostalgic identity politics. In short, together, the Democrats and Republicans have engineered a remarkable division of the working class along the lines of identity politics, which is a relative evil for precisely this reason. (emphasis added)<br/>That identity and cultural politics have been mobilized as a means to alienate and antagonize, to produce rifts and to engage in vilification, is easily demonstrable. The case of Duck Dynasty is only the latest installment in a long, disgusting tired litany of identity and cultural politics, which is nothing if not a gift to the ruling class as it works to put its own construction on the working class. Liberal and “progressive” politics feeds right into such efforts, albeit unwittingly. Such identity and cultural politics function to produce class as an identity (and as an abject identity at that), rather than showing it for what it is, a positionality within the relations of production. That’s right; class is not, at base, an identity, because there are no particular characteristics that attend to persons in the working class, and members of various identity groups can likewise occupy the working-class positionality. The working class is not an identity group; it is the occupation of a position of necessary subordination to and service of capital in the reproduction of capital and the alienation of the class from both the means and the ends of production. This cannot be said unequivocally for identities, which may migrate beyond the class, and seek to form alliances that are antithetical to the class’s interests, and thus to the politics of ultimate emancipation. This identity politics includes, of course, the efforts of the right to identify white workers with class interests antithetical to their own.<br/>This broader outline of the function of identity politics has been necessary for descrying how it functions within the “left,” whatever that may be. The wider function of identity politics must be understood before any miniature politics — a mere a tempest within a teapot I might add — can make the slightest bit of sense. The animus or supposed “vampirism” of identity politickers on the left, which is sometimes directed at Marxists who critique it, derives from this broader source: the persecution of subaltern identities by rightists who are trained by capital relations to produce themselves as such, and are trained to produce the denigrated groups as such, as well. Similarly, the leftists are trained to produce themselves as such, and to produce their denigrated opponents as such, as well. To say that these parallel forms of identity production and denigration mirror the master slave dialectic is to state the obvious; nevertheless it is notable that the categories are mutually constitutive. And it should be clear that their negation as such, as denigrated categories that is, could never be accomplished on the basis of identity alone.</p><p>AT: Foot Noting <br/>Identity critique has a built in half life; it’s impossible to privilege every identity group which requires prioritization of oppression or an infinitely regressive process of watching over watchers.

Rather, one can say that identity politics, as a method of literary analysis, will necessarily reflect the biases of its own time. While our consciousness of some selected and canonized identities has certainly been raised, the biases of those within the confines of the canon remain confirmed by their invisibility. Identity studies is no more perfect, value free, and objective than hermeneutics, structuralism, or any other applied discourse. Perhaps people of the future will be astounded, puzzled, and disturbed that works by scholars such as Eve Sedgewick, Judith Butler, Henry Louis Gates, bell hooks, and others managed to steer so completely away from any discussion of disability. I should make clear that my solution to the problem of identity is not inclusion of disability to the roster of favored identities. Rather, the point is that identity studies itself is limited in our time by the necessarily taxonomic peculiarity of its endeavor. Inclusiveness will not solve the problem. The list of identities will only grow larger, tied to an ever-expanding idea of inclusiveness. After all, when all identities are finally included in the roster, how can there be this particular kind of identity? If alterity is subsumed under the rubric of identity, then what can identity mean, particularly if this kind of cultural identity is somehow actually based on a binary opposition between self and other? Identity becomes so broad a category that it cannot contain identity. In other words, identity politics, while useful during the latter part of the twentieth century in securing civil rights for some disenfranchised groups, has by the twenty-first century reached a paradoxical resolution to a problem that started as a logical extension of a discussion about rights. It is Wendy Brown's (1995) point citing Foucault, that "the universal juridical ideal of liberalism," combined with "the normalizing principle of disciplinary regimes and taken up within the discourse of politicized identity," yields a new kind of subject "reiterative of regulatory, disciplinary society," which "ceaselessly characterizes, classifies, and specializes," working through "surveillance, continuous registration, perpetual assessment, and classification" and through a social machinery "that is both immense and minute" (p. 65). In other words, the classificatory and judgmental system inherent in an identity critique of novels will necessarily end up surveilling texts through an ever-expanding and therefore increasingly imprecise grid. This framework will therefore yield less and less information about more and more works and will become a system that explains everything, thus ultimately explaining nothing. For example, if the function of identity criticism has been to point out the sexism, racism, ableism, homophobia, and so on in canonical texts, then this policing action will eventually turn in on itself. In this case, the ever-increasing trolling for missed identities or stereotypical characters will have to, by its own logic, begin to critique itself. Critics will then point to other critics who have failed to notice incidents of particular "isms." And so on. Likewise, identity critics can point favorably at other texts that exhibit positive images of oppressed identities. Finally, there is also the possibility of locating "resistant" texts that appeared in more oppressive periods but that managed to tactically and strategically pass muster of the dominant culture while offering transgressive and elusive readings that allowed certain collusive readers to find resistance to that dominant paradigm. That seems to be the extent of identity critique, and this kind of work seems to have a built-in half-life. How long can any particular critic perform this particular activity? What will be perpetually needed are new identities on the block to keep the process going, although methodologically not much new will be happening in that street game. To complicate this already complicated critique further, I want to point to the inability of identity politics to include disability under its tent in some way other than with second-class status. My point is to question the following: How effective is an antidiscriminatory stance, based on identity politics, when the watchman always needs to be watched? Another way of putting this point is that no coalition of identity-based activists or scholars will ever be able to avoid marginalizing and minoritizing some group. Bosnian mothers.

See Carl von Clausewitz, On War 200-210 (Michael Howard and Peter Paret, ed. and trans., Princeton University Press 1976) (1832) (hereinafter “Clausewitz”). There “is no higher and simpler law of strategy” than to apply this principle in order to concentrate a nation’s military power its adversaries’ “center of gravity.” Id. at 204. This principle was first embraced by the American military during the 19th Century, and has subsequently shaped the organizational structure of American warfighting through two world wars and countless other conflicts. See James F. Schnabel, History of the Joints Chiefs of Staff, Vol. 1 at 80-87 (1996); Russell F. Weigley, History of the United States Army at 422-423 (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1984). Unity of command requires the integration of all combat functions into a single organizational element, with command authority vested in a single individual. See U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Joint Pub. 3-0, Joint Operations at Appx. A, p. A-2 (2010), available at <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/new_pubs/jp3_0.pdf.  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/new_pubs/jp3_0.pdf.%27" tppabs="http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/new_pubs/jp3_0.pdf."><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/new_pubs/jp3_0.pdf.</span></a></span> The U.S. military implements “unity of command” through its chain of command—a hierarchical organizational structure which transmits command authority from the President through the Secretary of Defense, through subordinate military officers, down to the lowest ranking soldier, sailor, airman or Marine on the frontlines of America’s armed conflicts. This chain of command serves important organizational purposes, by vesting command authority in individual officers who are responsible for specific missions, and are empowered to command their personnel to achieve those missions. The chain of command also supports important normative and legal policy purposes, such as the doctrine of “command responsibility,” which renders battlefield commanders responsible for all their units do or fail to do, whether they knew about such conduct, or should have known about it. See Application of Yamashita, 327 U.S. 1, 14-16 (1946); see also Army Field Manual 27-10, The Law of Land Warfare at ¶ 501 (1956) (stating U.S. Army doctrine on “command responsibility”). “Everything in war is very simple,” Clausewitz noted “Everything in war is very simple,” Clausewitz noted, “but the simplest thing is difficult.” Clausewitz at 119. The dangers of war, the fatigue of close combat, and the uncertainty which lurks within the fog of war, all combine to create a kind of “friction” which impedes the progress of armies. Id. A more contemporary author and veteran describes this fog: For the common soldier, at least, war has the feel, the spiritual texture, of a great ghostly fog, thick and permanent. There is no clarity. Everything swirls. The old rules are no longer binding, the old truths no longer true. Right spills over into wrong. Order blends into chaos, love into hate, ugliness into beauty, law into anarchy, civility into savagery. The vapor sucks you in. You can’t tell where you are, or why you’re there, and the only certainty is overwhelming ambiguity . . . . You lose your sense of the definite, hence your sense of truth itself. Tim O’Brien, The Things They Carried 88 (1990). The military chain of command is designed to counteract this fog and friction of war, by providing clarity of orders and purpose to individual soldiers and their units. Similarly, this organizational structure exists to impose some order on the behavior and actions of soldiers and units, aligning their conduct with national goals, framing their actions in the context of strategic and operational campaigns, and focusing their efforts on the missions which support these broader endeavors. It is this structure which differentiates the armed forces of a nation from an armed group of thugs, and which ensures that national armed forces conduct themselves in accordance with the laws of armed conflict. Cf. Annex to the Convention, Hague Convention No. IV Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land, art. 1, Oct. 18, 1907, 36 Stat. 2277, 205 Consol. T.S. 277; Geneva Convention (III) Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, art. 4, Aug. 12, 1949, 6 U.S.T. 3316, T.I.A.S. No. 3364. Our nation’s military personnel depend on their chain of command to provide them with certainty, clarity and authority in the heat of battle. Into this ordered system, Plaintiff wishes to inject the uncertainty of the American adversarial litigation process, by seeking, inter alia, that this Court declare there is no armed conflict in Yemen, and that orders issued by the President in response to that conflict should be enjoined. Not only would this force the court to go far beyond the “limited institutional competence of the judiciary” by involving it in sensitive matters of national security, cf. Arar v. Ashcroft, 585 F.3d 559, 576 (2d Cir. 2009) (citations omitted), but this also would undermine the chain of command by literally interposing this Court between the President and his subordinate officers, thereby contravening the core doctrinal principle of “unity of command,” which has served American military forces in good stead since the Civil War. In asking the Court to hear this case, and to entertain the extraordinary remedy of injunctive relief against the President and his cabinet, the Plaintiff is asking the court to overturn the political judgment of the President and Congress that the nation is at war; that this war is an armed conflict against Al Qaeda; and that it is appropriate to use a blend of military, intelligence and diplomatic force to wage this war. All three branches of Government have decided that “we are &nbsp;at war with al Qaeda and its affiliates.” Remarks of the President on National Security, May 21, 2009; see also Authorization for Use of Military Force (“AUMF”), Pub. L. No. 107-40, 115 Stat. 224 (2001); Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 548 U.S. 557, 628-31 (2006). Political leaders from both political parties, over the course of two presidencies and five elected Congresses, have agreed upon, authorized, and appropriated funds for this war against Al Qaeda. It is a fundamental axiom among American strategists that, “as a nation, the United States wages war employing all instruments of national power – diplomatic, informational, military, and economic.” U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Joint Pub. 1, Doctrine for the Armed Forces of the United States at I-1 (2009), available at <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/new_pubs/jp1.pdf.  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/new_pubs/jp1.pdf.%27" tppabs="http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/new_pubs/jp1.pdf."><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/new_pubs/jp1.pdf.</span></a></span> Plaintiff would seek to overturn the considered judgment of this nation’s political leaders in choosing the national strategy for this war, including the Attorney General of the United States, who has written that, in this war against Al Qaeda, “we must use every weapon at our disposal . . . including direct military action, military justice, intelligence, diplomacy, and civilian law enforcement.” See Letter from Attorney General Eric H. Holder, Jr. to Sen. Mitch McConnell, February 3, 2010 (emphasis added). The relief requested by plaintiff is both extraordinary and inappropriate, and completely inconsistent with the strategic imperative for “unified action which ensures unity of effort focused on national objectives and leading to the conclusion of operations on terms favorable to the United States.” See Joint Pub. 1 at I-1.</p><p>1NR A2: Alliances Solve <br/>its not a question of yes/no intervention, just a question of speed and effectiveness <br/>Posner and Vermeule 11(Eric, Kirkland and Ellis Professor of Law, The University of Chicago, and Adrian, John H.
