Since the Korean War, scholars and pundits have grown increasingly alarmed by the growing scope and techniques of presidential war making. In 1973, in the wake of Vietnam, Congress passed the joint War Powers Resolution (WPR) to increase Congress’s role in foreign policy and war making by requiring executive consultation with Congress prior to the use of military force, reporting within 48 hours after the start of hostiles, and requiring the close of military operations after 60 days unless Congress has authorized the use of force. Although the WPR was a significant legislative feat, 30 years since its passage, presidents have frequently ignores the WPR requirements and the changing nature of conflict does not fit neatly into these regulations. After the terrorist attacks on 9-11, many experts worry that executive war powers have expanded far beyond healthy limits. Consequently, there is a fear that continued expansion of these powers will undermine the constitutional system of checks and balances that maintain the democratic foundation of this country and risk constant and unlimited military actions, particularly in what Stephen Griffin refers to as a "long war" period like the War on Terror (<span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674058286).  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674058286).%27" tppabs="http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674058286)."><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674058286).</span></a></span> In comparison, pro-presidential powers advocates contend that new restrictions undermine flexibility and timely decision-making necessary to effectively counter contemporary national security risks. Thus, a debate about presidential wars powers is important to investigate a number of issues that have serious consequences on the status of democratic checks and national security of the United States. Lastly, debating presidential war powers is important because we the people have an important role in affecting the use of presidential war powers. As many legal scholars contend, regardless of the status of legal structures to check the presidency, an important political restrain on presidential war powers is the presence of a well-informed and educated public. As Justice Potter Stewart explains, "the only effective restraint upon executive policy and power…may lie in an enlightened citizenry – in an informed and critical public opinion which alone can protect the values of a democratic government" (<span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0403_0713_ZC3.html).  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0403_0713_ZC3.html).%27" tppabs="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0403_0713_ZC3.html)."><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0403_0713_ZC3.html).</span></a></span> As a result, this is not simply an academic debate about institutions and powers that that do not affect us. As the numerous recent foreign policy scandals make clear, anyone who uses a cell-phone or the internet is potential affected by unchecked presidential war powers. Even if we agree that these powers are justified, it is important that today’s college students understand and appreciate the scope and consequences of presidential war powers, as these students’ opinions will stand as an important potential check on the presidency.&nbsp;</p><p>4.

Since the Korean War, scholars and pundits have grown increasingly alarmed by the growing scope and techniques of presidential war making. In 1973, in the wake of Vietnam, Congress passed the joint War Powers Resolution (WPR) to increase Congress’s role in foreign policy and war making by requiring executive consultation with Congress prior to the use of military force, reporting within 48 hours after the start of hostiles, and requiring the close of military operations after 60 days unless Congress has authorized the use of force. Although the WPR was a significant legislative feat, 30 years since its passage, presidents have frequently ignores the WPR requirements and the changing nature of conflict does not fit neatly into these regulations. After the terrorist attacks on 9-11, many experts worry that executive war powers have expanded far beyond healthy limits. Consequently, there is a fear that continued expansion of these powers will undermine the constitutional system of checks and balances that maintain the democratic foundation of this country and risk constant and unlimited military actions, particularly in what Stephen Griffin refers to as a "long war" period like the War on Terror (<span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674058286).  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674058286).%27" tppabs="http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674058286)."><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674058286).</span></a></span> In comparison, pro-presidential powers advocates contend that new restrictions undermine flexibility and timely decision-making necessary to effectively counter contemporary national security risks. Thus, a debate about presidential wars powers is important to investigate a number of issues that have serious consequences on the status of democratic checks and national security of the United States. Lastly, debating presidential war powers is important because we the people have an important role in affecting the use of presidential war powers. As many legal scholars contend, regardless of the status of legal structures to check the presidency, an important political restrain on presidential war powers is the presence of a well-informed and educated public. As Justice Potter Stewart explains, "the only effective restraint upon executive policy and power…may lie in an enlightened citizenry – in an informed and critical public opinion which alone can protect the values of a democratic government" (<span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0403_0713_ZC3.html).  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0403_0713_ZC3.html).%27" tppabs="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0403_0713_ZC3.html)."><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0403_0713_ZC3.html).</span></a></span> As a result, this is not simply an academic debate about institutions and powers that that do not affect us. As the numerous recent foreign policy scandals make clear, anyone who uses a cell-phone or the internet is potential affected by unchecked presidential war powers. Even if we agree that these powers are justified, it is important that today’s college students understand and appreciate the scope and consequences of presidential war powers, as these students’ opinions will stand as an important potential check on the presidency.&nbsp;</p><p>4.

Rev. 1195)<br/>Both the Declare War Clause n49 and the War Powers Resolution n50 give Congress some <br/>AND<br/>case study with implications for the use of force over the coming decades.<br/>Article I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution grants to Congress <br/>AND<br/>. forces abroad in a limited manner based on this inherent authority. n55<br/>The Obama Administration has adopted this position - that a president has inherent constitutional authority <br/>AND<br/>.S. military personnel to significant risk over a substantial period." n60<br/>The Obama Administration’s position was not out of sync with previous presidential practice - the <br/>AND<br/>define whether a conflict is a "war" for constitutional purposes. n78<br/>The result of this reasoning is a substantially relaxed restraint on presidential authority to use <br/>AND<br/>action will increase as the makeup of our arsenal continues to modernize. n82<br/>Dudziak worries about the invocation of "wartime" as an argument for the perpetual <br/>AND<br/>And looking at the substance of that position leaves much to be desired.<br/>Both Koh’s testimony and the OLC memo pay lip service to the idea that the <br/>AND<br/>without the input of another coequal branch of government is potentially dangerous. n85<br/>As Dudziak’s framework highlights the limits of the Obama Administration’s argument for expansive power, <br/>AND<br/>catalog of manipulations remains incomplete because of the inherent limits of her framework.<br/>This realization does not detract from Dudziak’s warnings about the perils of endless wartime, <br/>AND<br/>presence as an ongoing feature of American democracy" (p. 136).<br/>Conclusion Dudziak presents a compelling argument and supports it well. War Time is potent <br/>AND<br/>to claim wartime powers - to render the extraordinary ordinary - is significant.<br/>This Notice has argued that, contrary to Dudziak’s concerns, the temptation is not absolute. Indeed, in some instances - notably, detention operations in Iraq and Afghanistan - we are still able to differentiate between "war" and "peace" in ways that have hard legal meaning for the actors involved. And, importantly, the executive still feels compelled to abide by these distinctions and act in accordance with the law rather than claim wartime exceptionalism.<br/>That the temptation is not absolute, however, does not mean that it is <br/>AND<br/>the American people, but instead their inattention" (p. 132).</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HNoimpacttodeterrence" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>No impact to deterrence</span></h4><p>- Conceptual confusion<br/>- Faulty threat assessment<br/>- Shortsighted policymaking<br/>- Failure to declare<br/>Betts 13 – Director of the Saltzman Institute of War and Peace Studies at Columbia University<br/>(Richard K., also Adjunct Senior Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, March/April, "The Lost Logic of Deterrence: What the Strategy That Won the Cold War Can-and Can’t-Do Now", Foreign Affairs 92.2, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/138846/richard-k-betts/the-lost-logic-of-deterrence-http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/138846/richard-k-betts/the-lost-logic-of-deterrence  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path excluded from retrieval by the project\%27s Exclusions properties.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/138846/richard-k-betts/the-lost-logic-of-deterrence-http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/138846/richard-k-betts/the-lost-logic-of-deterrence%27" tppabs="http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/138846/richard-k-betts/the-lost-logic-of-deterrence-http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/138846/richard-k-betts/the-lost-logic-of-deterrence"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/138846/richard-k-betts/the-lost-logic-of-deterrence-http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/138846/richard-k-betts/the-lost-logic-of-deterrence</span></a></span>, accessed 1-9-13 <em>Bosley)</em></p><p>Deterrence isn’t what it used to be.
