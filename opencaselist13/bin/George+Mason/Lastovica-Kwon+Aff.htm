An anthropologist by training, he is author of the books Mullahs on the Mainframe: Islam and Modernity Among the Daudi Bohras, and Arrow of the Blue-Skinned God: Retracing the Ramayana through India. From 1999-2011, Blank served as Policy Director for South and Southeast Asia on the staff of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Before entering government service, he served as senior editor and foreign correspondent for US News and World Report, where he reported from Indonesia, India, Nepal and Pakistan. In his life as an anthropologist, Blank was the first outside researcher to conduct ethnographic fieldwork among the Daudi Bohras, a Shi'a Muslim community with approximately one million adherents throughout South and Southeast Asia, East Africa, and other parts of the world; his research focused on how a traditionalist community used the tools of modernity to combat the threats posed by modernity.

Initially her academic research focused on China. She and her family lived in China on several occasions, primarily in Nanjing and Beijing, and traveled extensively throughout the Chinese countryside. During her time at Johns Hopkins University SAIS, she met former President George H W Bush on several occasions regarding China issues. Her work on the Chinese energy policy and the environment expanded to other parts of Asia, including field work and publications on Thailand, Indonesia, Japan, and Korea.After 17 years in academia, Dr. Davis took a hiatus to work for the US Government on issues related to Asia. Based in Hawaii, she travelled regularly to Asia to work on issues of preventive diplomacy. These USG projects included discussions on China with Pakistan, aiding Bangladesh during a difficult political time, and working with the Nepalese officials during the transition from monarchy to representative democracy as well as a citation for her work on the EP3 incident. Simultaneous to these on-the- ground projects, Dr. Davis maintained a rigorous academic agenda that including briefing US senators and congressmen, top US military officers, and foreign government officials on issues related to China and Asia. “China to rule the seas-unmanned,” 12-6-12, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/NL06Ad01.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/NL06Ad01.html%27" tppabs="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/NL06Ad01.html"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/NL06Ad01.html</span></a></span>, DOA: 7-18-13, y2k</p><p>In the cold blue waters between China and Japan, a Chinese fishing craft collided <br/>AND<br/>to specific power goals.
