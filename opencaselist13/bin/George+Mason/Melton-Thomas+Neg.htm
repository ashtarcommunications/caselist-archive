It ties strategy, philosophy<br/>and personal commitment tightly to personal veganism, abstention from eating and<br/>using animals as a form of individual action. Ontological Veganism insists that neither<br/>humans or animals should ever be conceived as edible or even as usable, confirming the<br/>treatment of humans as ‘outside nature’ that is part of human/nature dualism, and<br/>blocking any reconception of animals and humans in fully ecological terms. Because it is<br/>indiscriminate in proscribing all forms of animal use as having the same moral status, it<br/>fails to provide philosophical guidance for animal activism that would prioritise action on<br/>factory farming over less abusive forms of farming. Its universalism makes it highly<br/>ethnocentric, universalising a privileged ‘consumer’ perspective, ignoring contexts other<br/>than contemporary western urban ones, or aiming to treat them as minor, deviant<br/>‘exceptions’ to what it takes to be the ideal or norm. Although it claims to oppose the<br/>dominant mastery position, it remains subtly human-centred because it does not fully<br/>challenge human/nature dualism, but rather attempts to extend human status and<br/>privilege to a bigger class of ‘semi-humans’ who, like humans themselves, are conceived<br/>as above the non-conscious sphere and ‘outside nature’, beyond ecology and beyond use,<br/>especially use in the food chain. In doing so it stays within the system of human/nature<br/>dualism and denial that prevents the dominant culture from recognising its ecological<br/>embeddedness and places it increasingly at ecological risk.<br/>THE ALTERNATIVE is to reject veganism and instead embrace Ecological Animalism.<br/>2. Ecological Animalism is better than veganism – it deconstructs the human/nature binary and avoids the problems of dogmatism and universalism. &nbsp;Prefer this comparative evidence.<br/>Plumwood 3 (Val Plumwood.

But this is in effect a choice between alienation and domination. Adams’<br/>ethnocentric ontological veganism succeeds in this false contrast because its conceptual<br/>framework obscures the distinction between meat and animal food, where meat is a<br/>determinate cultural construction in terms of domination, and animal food is a cultural<br/>determinable. Meat is the result of an instrumentalist-reductionist framework, but the<br/>concept of animal food allows us the means to resist the reductions and denials of meat<br/>by honouring the edible life form as much more than food, and certainly much more than<br/>meat. If we must all, including humans, be ontologised ecologically as edible, as<br/>participating in the food web as a condition of our embodiment, that does not mean we<br/>must all be ontologised reductively as meat. Food, unlike the reductive category of meat<br/>that does not recognise that we are all always more than food, is not a hyperseparated<br/>category and does not have to be a disrespectful category.<br/>This distinction enables Ecological Animalism to stand with Ontological Veganism in<br/>affirming that no being, human or nonhuman, should be ontologised reductively as meat,<br/>and hence in opposing reductive commoditisation of animals. But unlike Ontological<br/>Veganism it can combine the rejection of commoditisation with the framework of<br/>ecology and cultural diversity by maintaining that all embodied beings are food and more<br/>than food, that is, with an ecological ontology. A careful contextualisation of food<br/>practices provides much better guidance for activism than a culturally hegemonic<br/>universalism. Ecological Animalism can provide a strong basis for opposing the<br/>"rationalised" commodity farming practices that reduce animals to living meat and are<br/>responsible for the great bulk and intensity of domestic animal misery in the modern<br/>west. It is of necessity more flexible, less dogmatic and universalist, but can still<br/>vindicate the major activist concerns of the animal defence movement. It would require<br/>us to avoid complicity in contemporary food practices that abuse animals, especially<br/>factory farming, and can agree there are plenty of good reasons for being a vegetarian in<br/>modern urban contexts where food sources are untraceable or treatment of animals<br/>known to be cruel or reductive. But for Ecological Animalism, vegetarianism would not<br/>represent any disgust at ‘corpses’ or ontological revulsion against our mutual condition as<br/>food, but rather protest at the unacceptable conditions of animal life and death in<br/>particular societies that reduce animals and commodify their flesh as ‘meat’, in terms<br/>that minimise their claims on us and on the earth.<br/>Case<br/>Value to life is subjective --- life is a prerequisite<br/>Schwartz 02 <br/>Lisa, Chair at the Centre for Health Economics and Policy Analysis, <br/>“Medical Ethic: A Case Based Approach” Chapter 6, www.fleshandbones.com/readingroom/pdf/399.pdf</p><p>The second assertion made by supporters of the quality of life as a criterion for <br/>AND<br/>imperative that we must treat persons as rational and as ends in themselves. <br/>“No value to life” doesn’t outweigh---prioritize existence because value is subjective and could improve in the future <br/>Tännsjö 11 <br/>Torbjörn, the Kristian Claëson Professor of Practical Philosophy at Stockholm University, 2011, “Shalt Thou Sometimes Murder?
