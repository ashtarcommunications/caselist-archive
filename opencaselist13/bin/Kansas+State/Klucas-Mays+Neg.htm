In the case of the 1990s, humanitarian interventions failed to get off the ground when President Clinton lost majorities in Congress.<br/>If American politics is becoming increasingly partisan, future administrations should have an even harder time galvanizing the domestic support they need to address any humanitarian crises.<br/>This does not mean, however, that humanitarian intervention will only occur when a president enjoys a majority in Congress. As the recently launched humanitarian missions suggest, politicians are learning the lessons of the 1990s and circumventing Congress.<br/>This helps explain why President Obama’s decision to contribute the U.S. military to NATO operations in Libya proceeded without Congressional authorization; the president was surely aware that such a vote would go down to defeat in a Republican-controlled House and deeply partisan Senate.<br/>Congress was similarly bypassed in October 2011 when the administration deployed military advisers to Uganda.<br/>Congress was similarly bypassed in 2011 and 2013 when the administration deployed military advisers to Uganda and Jordan, respectively.</p><p>Military intervention solves war<br/><strong>Goldstein 11</strong><br/>Joshua S.
