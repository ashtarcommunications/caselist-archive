In light of the abuses that have taken place under the Bush administration, it is the responsibility of a new administration to insist on transparency in the drafting of new legislation.<br/>There is a long history of attempts to revise the War Powers Resolution. As new legislation is drafted, though, it will be important to focus on the central constitutional issues. Much time has been spent in debating how to address contingencies. It will be impossible to write into law any comprehensive formula for every conceivable situation, though; much more important will be establishing the fundamental principles of reform:<br/>The War Powers Resolution should explicitly prohibit executive acts of war without previous Congressional authorization. The only exception should be the executive’s power in an emergency to use short-term force to repel sudden attacks on US territories, troops or citizens.<br/>It is true that many potential conflict situations will be murky, complicated or divisive, and that quick congressional action may not always be forthcoming. Yet, history shows the folly of launching wars that are not supported by the American people. The United States should not use military force until a substantial consensus develops in Congress and the public that military force is necessary, appropriate and wise.<br/>Today, as in 1787, the reality is that the interests of the people <br/>AND<br/>disguised as preemptive war, has no place in constitutional or international law.</p><h3 id="HContention22014-Warfighting" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Contention 2 —- Warfighting</span></h3><h4 id="HPowerprojectionstructurallyfailsbecauseoperationsareguidedbyincoherentstrategiesdisconnectedfromnationalpoliticalwill" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Power projection structurally fails because operations are guided by incoherent strategies disconnected from national political will</span></h4><p><strong>Gallagher 11</strong> – Lieutenant Colonel Joseph V.

Article II <br/>AND<br/>. Consequently, considerable power has flowed from Congress to the president.50<br/>Execution of US foreign policy is fraught with political uncertainty and vulnerability. Compared to <br/>AND<br/>to oversee the nation’s foreign policy has exposed America to unacceptable strategic risk.<br/>War, Strategy, and the Constitution<br/>One of Clausewitz’ greatest contributions to the study of war is his emphasis on the <br/>AND<br/>political dimension despite the recent emergence of nonstate actors and transnational groups.56<br/>In other words, success at the tactical level of war first requires careful preparations <br/>AND<br/>political objectives, and commitment of resources sufficient to achieve strategic objectives.58<br/>Since 1945, the United States has built the world’s most capable war-fighting machine. So why, then, have most of the nation’s large military interventions since World War II ended in defeat or, at best, stalemate? Political leaders should attend more to what Clausewitz calls the political dimensions of war—national unity and the political value of the objective—as inseparable from national and military strategy.<br/>War theorists have long emphasized the importance of national unity and the political value of <br/>AND<br/>mobilized for war, we must first examine our own political aim."60<br/>National unity underwrites the commitment the nation needs to successfully prosecute war, provided the <br/>AND<br/>, and the will and support of Congress to support the war.62<br/>A Risk to Strategy<br/>As the practice of declaring war has become passé, American strategy has likewise become <br/>AND<br/>63 This connection, Clausewitz observed, is necessary for success in war.<br/>For example, US strategy following World War II ironically came to resemble the German <br/>AND<br/>which has little tolerance for long, risky, or uncertain conflicts.65<br/>More recently, as the executive branch exercises greater authority in directing military interventions, <br/>AND<br/>American people’s collective will in their efforts to subvert our national strategy.67<br/>Vietnam Strategy<br/>The tragic military and political experience of Vietnam was spawned by an aggressive president promoting <br/>AND<br/>, failing to determine strategic objectives and the means to obtain them.70<br/>President Johnson made numerous decisions concerning the strategy and operations of the war, resulting in a strategy of incremental gradualism. Despite some tactical successes, Vietnam strategy never developed sufficient coherence nor the sustained support of the American people. Through executive design, Congress and the people never fully vetted the value of the political objective in the context of large-scale military intervention before President Johnson committed forces to combat.71<br/>As a result, President Johnson lacked the top cover of a war declaration. <br/>AND<br/>the American people; they could not have cared less about Vietnam.73<br/>Afghanistan and Iraq Strategies<br/>The strategies for the ongoing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan have both failed to properly incorporate national strategic ends, ways, and means in a consistent manner across the whole of government. In the absence of a national consensus on strategic ends, Congressman James Marshall (D-GA) not surprisingly identified:<br/>The mismatches among the needs of post-conflict stability operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, the size and the types of military forces available, and the pitiful scarcity of capability in the civilian branches of our government to effect nation-building efforts, as well as, our utter incompetence as a government in strategic communications.74<br/>US Afghanistan strategy has continually morphed from 2001 to the present. The sweeping language <br/>AND<br/>support for the effort when the strategy did not unfold as planned.78<br/>Eventually, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and their strategies became focal points in <br/>AND<br/>exposing the strategies to additional, unnecessary risk at a crucial time.79<br/>Another Cry for Reform<br/>In 2009, The National War Powers Commission, a bipartisan group commissioned under the <br/>AND<br/>declaration for "large" force deployments and "significant armed conflict."81<br/>The Commission recommended replacing the 1973 WPR with the War Powers Consultation Act of 2009 <br/>AND<br/>deploying forces into significant armed conflict without the full blessing of Congress.83<br/>Conclusion<br/>Reminiscent of the 1973 WPR, the National War Powers Commission’s effort to redress war <br/>AND<br/>resulted in the expenditure of national blood and treasure for strategically hollow ends.<br/>The Constitution is, in itself, a strategic national security document.

And, while administration members may have discussed this matter with some members of Congress, the administration never formally conferred with the legislative branch as a coequal partner in our constitutional system.<br/>Obviously, these points are not raised out of any lasting love for the late <br/>AND<br/>also the region-wide dispersion of thousands of weapons from Qaddafi’s armories.<br/>The inaction (some of it deliberate) of key congressional leaders during this period <br/>AND<br/>.

CONSENSUS IS ESSENTIAL TO NATIONAL COHESION<br/>The case for active, continuing congressional engagement on the many issues of high policy presented by an open-ended campaign against terrorism does not rest on an instinct for institutional self-aggrandizement. It is grounded in the critical need to forge and maintain America’s social cohesion as a nation caught up in war. War, especially prolonged war, always poses the risk of depleting that cohesion, so vital to domestic harmony and international effectiveness.<br/>Members of Congress should also realize how essential their involvement is to the morale and <br/>AND<br/>parallel, policy-centered procedures outlined here would serve that same need.<br/>Congress’s stand on how our nation uses the mighty arsenal at its disposal also bears <br/>AND<br/>when he acts "pursuant to an explicit or implied authorization of Congress."<br/>Marshaling international coalitions to wage the war on terrorism will depend importantly on giving our allies confidence that American power is guided and restrained by a disciplined relationship between Congress and President. Absent attentive, persistent congressional involvement, public diplomacy in the war on terrorism could lose much of the credibility that arises from the perception of America as a model of representative government.<br/>There is thus an enduring necessity to balance executive potency in military endeavors with the legislative review that provides democratic legitimacy. The challenge is not to enchain the presidency but to harness both branches to common purpose. On that insight the War Powers Resolution was founded, and in that insight may be found the germ of other innovations to guarantee that Congress will play its proper constitutional role in the war on terrorism.</p><h4 id="HEffectivepowerprojectionstopshotspotescalationtonuclearwar" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Effective power projection stops hotspot escalation to nuclear war</span></h4><p><strong>Kagan 7</strong> – Frederick Kagan, Resident Scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, and Michael O’Hanlon, Senior Fellow and Sydney Stein Jr. Chair in Foreign Policy Studies at the Brookings Institution, "The Case for Larger Ground Forces", Stanley Foundation Report, April, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://stanleyfoundation.org/publications/other/Kagan_OHanlon_07.pdf  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://stanleyfoundation.org/publications/other/Kagan_OHanlon_07.pdf%27" tppabs="http://stanleyfoundation.org/publications/other/Kagan_OHanlon_07.pdf"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://stanleyfoundation.org/publications/other/Kagan_OHanlon_07.pdf</span></a></span></p><p>We live at a time when wars not only rage in nearly every region but <br/>AND<br/>position to lead the way in countering major challenges to the global order.<br/>Let us highlight the threats and their consequences with a few concrete examples, emphasizing <br/>AND<br/>forces on offer, the bloodletting will probably, tragically, continue unabated.<br/>And as bad as things are in Iraq today, they could get worse. <br/>AND<br/>moment, although a major Taliban offensive appears to be in the offing.<br/>Sound US grand strategy must proceed from the recognition that, over the next few <br/>AND<br/>personnelintensive missions such as the ones now under way in Iraq and Afghanistan.<br/>Let us hope there will be no such large-scale missions for a while<br/>AND<br/>Such a measure is not only prudent, it is also badly overdue.</p><h4 id="HExecutivewarpowerruinssoftpowerandglobalalliances" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Executive war power ruins soft power and global alliances</span></h4><p><strong>Schiffer 9</strong> – Adam Schiffer, Ph.D., Assistant Professor of Political Science at Texas Christian University, and Carrie Liu Currier, Ph.D., Assistant Professor of Political Science at Texas Christian University, "War Powers, International Alliances, the President, and Congress", <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/repository/US_Gov_Balance_of_Power_SF.pdf  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/repository/US_Gov_Balance_of_Power_SF.pdf%27" tppabs="http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/repository/US_Gov_Balance_of_Power_SF.pdf"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/repository/US_Gov_Balance_of_Power_SF.pdf</span></a></span></p><p>The president’s advantages over Congress in the foreign policy realm have consequences far beyond the <br/>AND<br/>the second Bush administration has raised alarm in many countries around the world.<br/>In the past, the bipolar nature of the international system and the lack of <br/>AND<br/>presidential authority led to very disparate degrees of support from the international community.<br/>These two examples of U.S. military action in the Middle East offer <br/>AND<br/>was acknowledged as within the acceptable parameters as determined by the global community.<br/>In contrast, the 2003 war in Iraq did not gain the support of the <br/>AND<br/>other actors to give legitimacy to the U.S.-led war.<br/>The battle between the unilateralists and multilateralists with regard to U.S. foreign <br/>AND<br/>and how they are used to establish the legitimacy of American foreign policy.</p><h4 id="HGroundinguseofforceinconstitutionally-basedSOPcreatesaperceptionofbenignhegemonyandencouragesinternationalcooperationbasedonruleoflaw" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Grounding use of force in constitutionally-based SOP creates a perception of benign hegemony and encourages international cooperation based on rule of law</span></h4><p>Ikenberry 1 – G.

"Law is a process by which we increase our range of freedom" and "we are constantly enlarging our freedom by being able to predict what others are going to do." ~6~ The United States gets a more predictable environment and more willing partners.<br/>There have been many moments when Asian and European allies have complained about the heavy-handedness of U.S. foreign policy, but the open and institutionalized character of the American order has minimized the possibilities of hegemonic excess over the long term.

The unipolar moment will pass. In facing this circumstance, American grand strategy should be informed by answers to this question: What sort of international order would we like to see in place in 2020 or 2030 when America is less powerful?<br/>Grand strategy is a set of coordinated and sustained policies designed to address the long<br/>AND<br/>States will need to return to the great tasks of liberal order building.<br/>It is useful to distinguish between two types of grand strategy: positional and milieu <br/>AND<br/>the future, this milieu-based approach to grand strategy is necessary.<br/>The United States does not face the sort of singular geopolitical threat that it did <br/>AND<br/>as the foundations of American national security, would be put at risk.<br/>What unites these threats and challenges is that they are all manifestations of rising security <br/>AND<br/>this unusually diverse, diffuse, and unpredictable array of threats and challenges.<br/>This is why a milieu-based grand strategy is attractive. The objective is <br/>AND<br/>its networks of social relations, that are available for solving collective problems.<br/>If American grand strategy is to be organized around liberal order building, what are <br/>AND<br/>, etc.—these safeguards are the stuff of a protective global infrastructure.<br/>Second, the United States should recommit to and rebuild its security alliances. The <br/>AND<br/>legally binding one, and in exchange it gets cooperation and political support.<br/>Third, the United States should reform and create encompassing global institutions that foster and <br/>AND<br/>grows rapidly when their governments can stand behind a UN-sanctioned action.<br/>Fourth, the United States should accommodate and institution-ally engage China. China <br/>AND<br/>has no choice but to join it and seek to prosper within it.<br/>The United States should also be seeking to construct a regional security order in East <br/>AND<br/>institutional arrangements in East Asia that will tie China to the wider region.<br/>Fifth, the United States should reclaim a liberal internationalist public philosophy. When American <br/>AND<br/>American elites as they make trade-offs between sovereignty and institutional cooperation.<br/>Under this philosophy, the restraint and the commitment of American power went hand in hand. Global rules and institutions advanced America’s national interest rather than threatened it. The alternative public philosophies that have circulated in recent years—philosophies that champion American unilateralism and disentanglement from global rules and institutions—did not meet with great success. So an opening exists for America’s postwar vision of internationalism to be updated and rearticulated today.<br/>The United States should embrace the tenets of this liberal public philosophy: Lead with <br/>AND<br/>and let the global system itself do the deep work of liberal modernization.<br/>As it navigates this brave new world, the United States will find itself needing <br/>AND<br/>liberal order building, it can begin the process of gaining it back.</p><h3 id="HContention32014-SOP" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Contention 3 —- SOP</span></h3><h4 id="HUncheckedwarpowersetsaprecedentthatcausestheexecutivetobroadlyignoreCongressionalcontrols" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Unchecked war power sets a precedent that causes the executive to broadly ignore Congressional controls</span></h4><p><strong>Barron 8</strong> – David J.

Meigs’s subsequent ~*985~ report recommended that an aqueduct be built just above Great Falls, north of Washington. Congress approved that recommendation, and the Department of War began work on the aqueduct, led by Meigs himself. For several years, things ran very smoothly. In the Buchanan Administration, however, Meigs’s relationship with Secretary of War John Floyd turned sour: Floyd dismissed Meigs and made sure the Administration’s proposed budget included no funds for work on the aqueduct. Meigs subject to legislatively imposed restrictions. As we have seen, Presidents have long operated on just that assumption, and they have adjusted their actions accordingly - and in ways that cannot be said to have clearly imperiled the nation. Thus the history undermines assertions about the inherent or inevitable unmanageability or dangers of recognizing legislative control over the conduct of war. In other words, this history offers us valuable information about how things have worked in the past, and thereby helps to inform us about what consequences might follow from a constitutional judgment in the here and now.<br/>Moreover, this historical account performs at least one function beyond supplying information relevant to <br/>AND<br/>for a change that risks such a fundamental revision of our national identity.</p><h4 id="HU.S.warpowersaremodeledinternationally2014-theprecedentofunilateralexecutiveauthorityruinsglobalhumanrightsnormsandencouragespreemptiveconflictinmultiplehotspots" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>U.S. war powers are modeled internationally —- the precedent of unilateral executive authority ruins global human rights norms and encourages preemptive conflict in multiple hotspots</span></h4><p><strong>Sloane 8</strong> – Sloane, Associate Professor of Law, Boston University School of Law, 2008 (Robert, Boston University Law Review, April, 88 B.U.L.

As John Locke tells us:<br/>It may be too great a temptation to human frailty apt to grasp at power <br/>AND<br/>rest of the community, contrary to the ends of society and government.<br/>Madison, Hamilton, and Locke sum up the fears expressed by many over the exercises of power by President Bush in the war on terror. As one prominent critic put it, President Bush is trying to "eliminate nearly all the checks and balances that have been traditionally understood to limit the power of the president."18<br/>The power to declare war, when properly understood, provides Congress with a powerful <br/>AND<br/>over appropriations ensures that Congress can always end a conflict it deems unwise.<br/>Rather, a declaration of war is about acknowledging the severity of a threat to <br/>AND<br/>and the president did not need expanded domestic powers to prosecute the wars.<br/>By contrast, while the war on terror does have components that look like traditional <br/>AND<br/>branch of American government. The power to declare war provides that check.<br/>Understanding the declare war clause along these lines clearly separates potential armed conflicts into distinct <br/>AND<br/>used and what powers can be called upon to support the military effort.<br/>In a perfect war:<br/>One whole nation is at war with another whole nation; and all the members of the nation declaring war are authorized to commit hostilities against all the members of the other, in every place, and under every circumstance. In such a war all the members act under a general authority, and all the rights and consequences of war attach to their condition.20<br/>In a perfect war, the entire energy of the nation is directed towards the effort, while an imperfect war is fought in a more ~End Page 6~ limited manner. Justice Chase’s concurrence in Bas explains the limitations that result from a war being imperfect:<br/>Congress has not declared war in general terms, but Congress has authorized hostilities on <br/>AND<br/>only to citizens appointed by commissions or exposed to immediate outrage and violence.<br/>A war of the formally declared, or perfect, type involves a level and <br/>AND<br/>for food and materiel, or even intern large numbers of American citizens.<br/>When the country is not in a state of perfect war by virtue of a <br/>AND<br/>power to take over the mills and force them to produce steel.21<br/>Despite Truman’s claim of inherent authority and military necessity, the seizure of the mills was struck down as it was, according to Justice Black’s opinion, "lawmaking, a legislative function which the Constitution has expressly confided to the Congress and not to the President. … In the framework of our Constitution, the President’s power to see that the laws are faithfully executed refutes the idea that he is to be a lawmaker."22 Furthermore:<br/>The order cannot properly be sustained as an exercise of the President’s military power as <br/>AND<br/>a job for the Nation’s lawmakers, not for its military authorities.23<br/>When the president wants to take, pursuant to his powers as commander-in<br/>AND<br/>terrorist organizations, or change the rules governing the procedures for military commissions.<br/>In wartime, however, it may be neither expedient nor strategically sound for the <br/>AND<br/>Congress time and time again to enact laws to advance the war effort.<br/>The declarations of war for World Wars I and II both contain specific, particular<br/>AND<br/>than when using force in a less comprehensive manner during a limited conflict.<br/>"All the resources of the government" and "all of the resources of <br/>AND<br/>congressional legislation, there are still certain constitutional guarantees that cannot be ignored.<br/>In the narrow interpretation advanced by the Bush administration, the trigger for the president’s <br/>AND<br/>in the balance of powers between the president and Congress in wartime."27<br/>This argument is unsatisfying on two grounds.

Compared to <br/>AND<br/>to oversee the nation’s foreign policy has exposed America to unacceptable strategic risk.<br/>War, Strategy, and the Constitution<br/>One of Clausewitz’ greatest contributions to the study of war is his emphasis on the <br/>AND<br/>political dimension despite the recent emergence of nonstate actors and transnational groups.56<br/>In other words, success at the tactical level of war first requires careful preparations <br/>AND<br/>political objectives, and commitment of resources sufficient to achieve strategic objectives.58<br/>Since 1945, the United States has built the world’s most capable war-fighting machine. So why, then, have most of the nation’s large military interventions since World War II ended in defeat or, at best, stalemate? Political leaders should attend more to what Clausewitz calls the political dimensions of war—national unity and the political value of the objective—as inseparable from national and military strategy.<br/>War theorists have long emphasized the importance of national unity and the political value of <br/>AND<br/>mobilized for war, we must first examine our own political aim."60<br/>National unity underwrites the commitment the nation needs to successfully prosecute war, provided the <br/>AND<br/>, and the will and support of Congress to support the war.62<br/>A Risk to Strategy<br/>As the practice of declaring war has become passé, American strategy has likewise become <br/>AND<br/>63 This connection, Clausewitz observed, is necessary for success in war.<br/>For example, US strategy following World War II ironically came to resemble the German <br/>AND<br/>which has little tolerance for long, risky, or uncertain conflicts.65<br/>More recently, as the executive branch exercises greater authority in directing military interventions, <br/>AND<br/>American people’s collective will in their efforts to subvert our national strategy.67<br/>Vietnam Strategy<br/>The tragic military and political experience of Vietnam was spawned by an aggressive president promoting <br/>AND<br/>, failing to determine strategic objectives and the means to obtain them.70<br/>President Johnson made numerous decisions concerning the strategy and operations of the war, resulting in a strategy of incremental gradualism. Despite some tactical successes, Vietnam strategy never developed sufficient coherence nor the sustained support of the American people. Through executive design, Congress and the people never fully vetted the value of the political objective in the context of large-scale military intervention before President Johnson committed forces to combat.71<br/>As a result, President Johnson lacked the top cover of a war declaration. <br/>AND<br/>the American people; they could not have cared less about Vietnam.73<br/>Afghanistan and Iraq Strategies<br/>The strategies for the ongoing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan have both failed to properly incorporate national strategic ends, ways, and means in a consistent manner across the whole of government. In the absence of a national consensus on strategic ends, Congressman James Marshall (D-GA) not surprisingly identified:<br/>The mismatches among the needs of post-conflict stability operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, the size and the types of military forces available, and the pitiful scarcity of capability in the civilian branches of our government to effect nation-building efforts, as well as, our utter incompetence as a government in strategic communications.74<br/>US Afghanistan strategy has continually morphed from 2001 to the present. The sweeping language <br/>AND<br/>support for the effort when the strategy did not unfold as planned.78<br/>Eventually, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and their strategies became focal points in <br/>AND<br/>exposing the strategies to additional, unnecessary risk at a crucial time.79<br/>Another Cry for Reform<br/>In 2009, The National War Powers Commission, a bipartisan group commissioned under the <br/>AND<br/>declaration for "large" force deployments and "significant armed conflict."81<br/>The Commission recommended replacing the 1973 WPR with the War Powers Consultation Act of 2009 <br/>AND<br/>deploying forces into significant armed conflict without the full blessing of Congress.83<br/>Conclusion<br/>Reminiscent of the 1973 WPR, the National War Powers Commission’s effort to redress war <br/>AND<br/>resulted in the expenditure of national blood and treasure for strategically hollow ends.<br/>The Constitution is, in itself, a strategic national security document.

CONSENSUS IS ESSENTIAL TO NATIONAL COHESION<br/>The case for active, continuing congressional engagement on the many issues of high policy presented by an open-ended campaign against terrorism does not rest on an instinct for institutional self-aggrandizement. It is grounded in the critical need to forge and maintain America’s social cohesion as a nation caught up in war. War, especially prolonged war, always poses the risk of depleting that cohesion, so vital to domestic harmony and international effectiveness.<br/>Members of Congress should also realize how essential their involvement is to the morale and <br/>AND<br/>parallel, policy-centered procedures outlined here would serve that same need.<br/>Congress’s stand on how our nation uses the mighty arsenal at its disposal also bears <br/>AND<br/>when he acts "pursuant to an explicit or implied authorization of Congress."<br/>Marshaling international coalitions to wage the war on terrorism will depend importantly on giving our allies confidence that American power is guided and restrained by a disciplined relationship between Congress and President. Absent attentive, persistent congressional involvement, public diplomacy in the war on terrorism could lose much of the credibility that arises from the perception of America as a model of representative government.<br/>There is thus an enduring necessity to balance executive potency in military endeavors with the legislative review that provides democratic legitimacy. The challenge is not to enchain the presidency but to harness both branches to common purpose. On that insight the War Powers Resolution was founded, and in that insight may be found the germ of other innovations to guarantee that Congress will play its proper constitutional role in the war on terrorism.</p><h4 id="HEffectivepowerprojectionstopshotspotescalationtonuclearwar-1" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Effective power projection stops hotspot escalation to nuclear war</span></h4><p><strong>Kagan 7</strong> – Frederick Kagan, Resident Scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, and Michael O’Hanlon, Senior Fellow and Sydney Stein Jr. Chair in Foreign Policy Studies at the Brookings Institution, "The Case for Larger Ground Forces", Stanley Foundation Report, April, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://stanleyfoundation.org/publications/other/Kagan_OHanlon_07.pdf  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://stanleyfoundation.org/publications/other/Kagan_OHanlon_07.pdf%27" tppabs="http://stanleyfoundation.org/publications/other/Kagan_OHanlon_07.pdf"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://stanleyfoundation.org/publications/other/Kagan_OHanlon_07.pdf</span></a></span></p><p>We live at a time when wars not only rage in nearly every region but <br/>AND<br/>position to lead the way in countering major challenges to the global order.<br/>Let us highlight the threats and their consequences with a few concrete examples, emphasizing <br/>AND<br/>forces on offer, the bloodletting will probably, tragically, continue unabated.<br/>And as bad as things are in Iraq today, they could get worse. <br/>AND<br/>moment, although a major Taliban offensive appears to be in the offing.<br/>Sound US grand strategy must proceed from the recognition that, over the next few <br/>AND<br/>personnelintensive missions such as the ones now under way in Iraq and Afghanistan.<br/>Let us hope there will be no such large-scale missions for a while<br/>AND<br/>Such a measure is not only prudent, it is also badly overdue.</p><h4 id="HExecutivewarpowerruinssoftpowerandglobalalliances-1" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Executive war power ruins soft power and global alliances</span></h4><p><strong>Schiffer 9</strong> – Adam Schiffer, Ph.D., Assistant Professor of Political Science at Texas Christian University, and Carrie Liu Currier, Ph.D., Assistant Professor of Political Science at Texas Christian University, "War Powers, International Alliances, the President, and Congress", <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/repository/US_Gov_Balance_of_Power_SF.pdf  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/repository/US_Gov_Balance_of_Power_SF.pdf%27" tppabs="http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/repository/US_Gov_Balance_of_Power_SF.pdf"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/repository/US_Gov_Balance_of_Power_SF.pdf</span></a></span></p><p>The president’s advantages over Congress in the foreign policy realm have consequences far beyond the <br/>AND<br/>the second Bush administration has raised alarm in many countries around the world.<br/>In the past, the bipolar nature of the international system and the lack of <br/>AND<br/>presidential authority led to very disparate degrees of support from the international community.<br/>These two examples of U.S. military action in the Middle East offer <br/>AND<br/>was acknowledged as within the acceptable parameters as determined by the global community.<br/>In contrast, the 2003 war in Iraq did not gain the support of the <br/>AND<br/>other actors to give legitimacy to the U.S.-led war.<br/>The battle between the unilateralists and multilateralists with regard to U.S. foreign <br/>AND<br/>and how they are used to establish the legitimacy of American foreign policy.</p><h4 id="HGroundinguseofforceinconstitutionally-basedSOPcreatesaperceptionofbenignhegemonyandencouragesinternationalcooperationbasedonruleoflaw-1" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Grounding use of force in constitutionally-based SOP creates a perception of benign hegemony and encourages international cooperation based on rule of law</span></h4><p>Ikenberry 1 – G.

Calling an attack on a terrorist cell a war is fallacious because "war has traditionally been understood as involving nation-states," n143 while al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations are not nation states. n144 Under international law, "insurgent" is the lowest status for a type of warfare combatants and requires the group:<br/>(1) to represent an identifiable group of people or to have a relatively stable ... base of support within a broader population; (2) to have the semblance of a government; (3) to have an organized military force and to be able to field its military units in hostilities; and (4) to control significant portion of territory as its own. n145<br/>Al Qaeda fails to meet this definition, as it does not possess anything that resembles a government and does not control significant territory of its own. n146 While including terrorism in the international law definition of war may sound appealing, there are reasons to be cautious.<br/>Even if the United States and al Qaeda cannot officially be at war, the <br/>AND<br/>mechanism for engaging in armed combat with a terrorist organization that lacks statehood.<br/>Traditionally, the United States responded to acts of terrorism through use of the legal <br/>AND<br/>formal criminal proceedings may be limited by geographic constraints and jurisdictional requirements. n152<br/>The history of the United States shows us that there are a litany of different <br/>AND<br/>and the Congress-First view with regard to traditional war powers activities.<br/>D.

Does this mean the Office of Homeland Security is working? It’s unclear. If terrorist attacks have been foiled, it has been a well-kept secret. More likely, we’ve just been lucky.<br/>All we really know about homeland security is that Tom Ridge, after several months on the job, has announced a color-coded warning system that few Americans understand, and even fewer believe will make a tinker’s damn of difference to their safety.<br/>We also know that there is a wide consensus of opinion in Washington, outside the Bush Administration, that the Office of Homeland Security is all hat, and no cattle - as they say in Texas. And finally, we know that Ridge has refused to testify about his work.<br/>I’m sure I don’t have to tell anyone, but Americans are being treated like fools. Fortunately, they are much more sophisticated today, and better informed, than they were during World War II, when FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover was able to bluff the public into believing the vigilance of the FBI was protecting them from Nazi and Japanese saboteurs. The historical records show Hoover was not effective at all, only occasionally fortunate.<br/>Congressional oversight and the collective wisdom of Congress are essential in our dealing with terrorism<br/>AND<br/>incompetent appointees (after all, they chose them in the first place)?<br/>In contrast, Congress wants to do all these things, thereby keeping a President on his toes. Its oversight is crucial - for the Presidential and Executive Branch limitations I’ve suggested are only a few of the myriad problems that might hamper the efficacy of the Executive in its efforts to deal with terrorism, and that Congress can help to correct.</p><h4 id="HTerroristswon2019tattacktheUS2014fewdeaths2Cnoterrorists2Cnomotivation2Ceffectiveprevention" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Terrorists won’t attack the US—few deaths, no terrorists, no motivation, effective prevention</span></h4><p><strong>Schanzer, 13</strong> (David H., Associate Professor of the Practice at the Duke Sanford School of Public Policy and Director of the Triangle Center on Terrorism and Homeland Security, 4/17, "Mostly Quiet on the Western Front", Foreign Policy, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/04/17/why_is_domestic_  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/04/17/why_is_domestic_%27" tppabs="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/04/17/why_is_domestic_"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/04/17/why_is_domestic_</span></a></span> terrorism_so_rare?page=0,0-<span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/04/17/why_is_domestic_  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/04/17/why_is_domestic_%27" tppabs="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/04/17/why_is_domestic_"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/04/17/why_is_domestic_</span></a></span> terrorism_so_rare?page=0,0)</p><p>While the horrific bombing at the Boston Marathon has brought concerns about terrorism back to <br/>AND<br/>1970s, but only 168 in the 10 years after 9/11.<br/>Our instincts tell us that terrorism ought to be quite common.

Those who do generally accept the normal rule that disagreements are decided through elections or legislation. Sure, there is vitriol in American politics. But free speech and debate serves as a release valve for pent-up ideological animosities.

The adventure of training in the Hindu Kush and fighting against foreign infidels once had a romantic allure to many — hiding from American drones in the hinterlands of Pakistan does not.<br/>We have also benefitted from a strategically inept enemy.

He has walked a fine line on Syria, for example, saying he wasn’t required to seek sign-off from lawmakers for a military strike but asking for their approval anyway.<br/>A senior administration official said that while the new drone-strike policy does rein in executive authority, the NSA and Syria proposals weren’t a reduction of power but an effort to increase transparency and build public confidence.<br/>Still, the president, who was criticized for seizing too much power through recess appointments and other steps that some said circumvented Congress, now is being criticized by veterans of past Republican administrations for weakening the presidency.<br/>John Yoo, a Justice Department official in the George W. Bush administration, said Mr. Obama had unnecessarily limited his own authority.

As the President pursues diplomacy with Syria and Iran, the U.S. Congress must reaffirm the tough policy positions that have gotten us to this point.<br/>It is more important than ever that the Congress affirm and strengthen its commitment to <br/>AND<br/>system as a lack of American resolve in opposition to Iranian nuclear development.<br/>A nuclear Iran would pose a far greater threat to our country than Syria likely <br/>AND<br/>radical Islam would achieve unprecedented and potentially irreversible power in the Middle East.<br/>A core, longstanding plank of the President’s policy to deter Iran from obtaining nuclear <br/>AND<br/>people and their leaders having shown themselves very wary of new military engagements.<br/>In the wake of the deal for the removal of chemical weapons from Syria, <br/>AND<br/>deter – by means of a credible military threat – Iranian nuclear development. <br/>And Congress must not delay in sending this message. Syria’s apparent use of chemical weapons—and the subsequent, lengthy debate about how to respond—underscore the need for Congress to speak well before Iran achieves a nuclear-weapons capability. Otherwise, Congressional action would be too late, and our deterrence policy will already have fallen short, with dire consequences.<br/>Notwithstanding all that has happened in Syria, Iran is currently accelerating the expansion of its uranium-enrichment capacity and the development of a reactor that can yield plutonium for bombs. Russia, newly emboldened and ever cynical, is reportedly on the verge of significant new arms sales to Iran. And while Iran’s new President Hassan Rouhani has signaled his desire to improve relations with the U.S., he has not matched his rhetoric with actions.</p><h4 id="HNoimpactto22flexibility222014-theirevusesitinadifferentcontext2Clike22flexibilitytoAVOIDforce222014-provestheplan2019saturnbydecreasingthreats" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>No impact to "flexibility"—-their ev uses it in a different context, like "flexibility to AVOID force"—-proves the plan’s a turn by decreasing threats</span></h4><h4 id="HCongresswouldeasilyauthorizeforce2014-makesnegotiationseffective" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Congress would easily authorize force —- makes negotiations effective</span></h4><p><strong>Troyan 13</strong> – Mary Orndorff Troyan, Reporter at Gannett Washington Bureau, "Graham: Congress Should Approve Military Strike Against Iran", WLTX, 7-18, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.wltx.com/news/article/242923/2/Graham-Congress-Should-Approve-Military-Strike-Against-Iran  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.wltx.com/news/article/242923/2/Graham-Congress-Should-Approve-Military-Strike-Against-Iran%27" tppabs="http://www.wltx.com/news/article/242923/2/Graham-Congress-Should-Approve-Military-Strike-Against-Iran"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.wltx.com/news/article/242923/2/Graham-Congress-Should-Approve-Military-Strike-Against-Iran</span></a></span></p><p>Congress would authorize President Barack Obama to use military force to stop Iran’s nuclear weapons program, under legislation Sen. Lindsey Graham plans to offer later this year.<br/>"My goal is to avoid war, and the best way to avoid war is to let the Iranians know they’re going to face one and lose," Graham said.<br/>The Seneca Republican, in an interview Tuesday at the Capitol, said he wants Congress to reinforce Obama’s position of not ruling out the use of military power to prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb.<br/>"What I want to do this fall is try to get my colleagues to <br/>AND<br/>be the last card to play before we have to actually use force."<br/>Vice President Joe Biden said in March that Obama is "not bluffing" when it comes to preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear capability.<br/>"We are not looking for war," Biden said in a speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. "We are looking to and ready to negotiate peacefully, but all options, including military force, are on the table."<br/>Graham, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said he agrees with the White House that preventing Iranians from developing nuclear weapons makes more sense than trying to contain them once the weapons are a reality.<br/>Introducing a war resolution in September or October, Graham said, would give more time for economic sanctions to work and would give the new Iranian president, Hasan Rawhani, a chance to act first.<br/>But Graham said he’s growing more skeptical Iran will stand down without a stronger threat of military action from the U.S.<br/>"If the Iranians thought for a moment that the U.S. would seriously consider taking out their nuclear program, it would reinforce the sanctions," Graham told European Union legislators visiting Washington. "Without a belief the American military would act, I think the Iranians are going to move forward."<br/>Anthony Cordesman, a security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said Graham’s legislation, assuming it receives broad bipartisan support, would also send a key message to U.S. friends in the region.<br/>"Many allies also wonder after Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria whether the U.S. is really willing to act," Cordesman said.<br/>In May, the Senate voted 99-0 for a resolution by Graham saying the U.S. supports Israel’s right to defend itself against Iran’s nuclear program, and that the U.S. would provide Israel with diplomatic, military and economic support if it came to that.<br/>Cordesman said the vote suggests authorizing use of force - without mandating it - also could get broad support in Congress.<br/>"It would get rid of reservations that do exist in Iran that basically you have a divided Congress and the president doesn’t have the public support he needs to act," Cordesman said.</p><p>Perm solves best - Multiplicity of theories is necessary to solve for human suffering and escape the current system.

This is not about truth. Truth is a generality, an abstraction of a certain shape and quality. Social realities are something else again. Postmodernism has decided that because truth died with God, there are no social facts. The fact that reality is a social construction does not mean that it is not there; it means that it is there, in society, where we live. According to postmodernism, there are no facts; everything is a reading, so there can be no lies. Apparently it cannot be known whether the Holocaust is a hoax, whether women love to be raped, whether Black people are genetically intellectually inferior to white people, whether homosexuals are child molesters. To postmodernists, these factish things are indeterminate, contingent, in play, all a matter of interpretation. Similarly, whether or not acts of incest happened or are traumatic to children become fogged over in "epistemological quandaries" as beyond thinking, beyond narrative, beyond intelligibility, as "this event that is no event"—as if survivors have not often reported, in intelligible narratives, that such events did happen and did harm them.41 That violation often damages speech and memory does not mean that, if one has speech and memory, one was not violated. Recall when Bill Clinton, asked about his sexual relationship with a young woman intern, said that it all depended on what "is" means. The country jeered his epistemic dodge as a transparent and slimy subterfuge to evade accountability: get real. The postmodernists were strangely silent. But you can’t commit perjury if there are no facts.

I won’t make the argument on that here, but simply assert it. What is most important is that the republic not be overwhelmed in the course of pursuing imperial goals.

As John Locke tells us:<br/>It may be too great a temptation to human frailty apt to grasp at power <br/>AND<br/>rest of the community, contrary to the ends of society and government.<br/>Madison, Hamilton, and Locke sum up the fears expressed by many over the exercises of power by President Bush in the war on terror. As one prominent critic put it, President Bush is trying to "eliminate nearly all the checks and balances that have been traditionally understood to limit the power of the president."18<br/>The power to declare war, when properly understood, provides Congress with a powerful <br/>AND<br/>over appropriations ensures that Congress can always end a conflict it deems unwise.<br/>Rather, a declaration of war is about acknowledging the severity of a threat to <br/>AND<br/>and the president did not need expanded domestic powers to prosecute the wars.<br/>By contrast, while the war on terror does have components that look like traditional <br/>AND<br/>branch of American government. The power to declare war provides that check.<br/>Understanding the declare war clause along these lines clearly separates potential armed conflicts into distinct <br/>AND<br/>used and what powers can be called upon to support the military effort.<br/>In a perfect war:<br/>One whole nation is at war with another whole nation; and all the members of the nation declaring war are authorized to commit hostilities against all the members of the other, in every place, and under every circumstance. In such a war all the members act under a general authority, and all the rights and consequences of war attach to their condition.20<br/>In a perfect war, the entire energy of the nation is directed towards the effort, while an imperfect war is fought in a more ~End Page 6~ limited manner. Justice Chase’s concurrence in Bas explains the limitations that result from a war being imperfect:<br/>Congress has not declared war in general terms, but Congress has authorized hostilities on <br/>AND<br/>only to citizens appointed by commissions or exposed to immediate outrage and violence.<br/>A war of the formally declared, or perfect, type involves a level and <br/>AND<br/>for food and materiel, or even intern large numbers of American citizens.<br/>When the country is not in a state of perfect war by virtue of a <br/>AND<br/>power to take over the mills and force them to produce steel.21<br/>Despite Truman’s claim of inherent authority and military necessity, the seizure of the mills was struck down as it was, according to Justice Black’s opinion, "lawmaking, a legislative function which the Constitution has expressly confided to the Congress and not to the President. … In the framework of our Constitution, the President’s power to see that the laws are faithfully executed refutes the idea that he is to be a lawmaker."22 Furthermore:<br/>The order cannot properly be sustained as an exercise of the President’s military power as <br/>AND<br/>a job for the Nation’s lawmakers, not for its military authorities.23<br/>When the president wants to take, pursuant to his powers as commander-in<br/>AND<br/>terrorist organizations, or change the rules governing the procedures for military commissions.<br/>In wartime, however, it may be neither expedient nor strategically sound for the <br/>AND<br/>Congress time and time again to enact laws to advance the war effort.<br/>The declarations of war for World Wars I and II both contain specific, particular<br/>AND<br/>than when using force in a less comprehensive manner during a limited conflict.<br/>"All the resources of the government" and "all of the resources of <br/>AND<br/>congressional legislation, there are still certain constitutional guarantees that cannot be ignored.<br/>In the narrow interpretation advanced by the Bush administration, the trigger for the president’s <br/>AND<br/>in the balance of powers between the president and Congress in wartime."27<br/>This argument is unsatisfying on two grounds. First, it cannot be said that <br/>AND<br/>1989 Panama War, or of Yugoslavs during the Kosovo conflict. …"29<br/>The second reason that this argument does not work is in the language of the <br/>AND<br/>war powers and places the president at the height of his war powers.<br/>But the language of the AUMFs does not support such an argument. Where the <br/>AND<br/>times of crisis, Congress still can and must play an important role.<br/>As President Ford admonished, a theory of war powers must be capable of functioning <br/>AND<br/>-so to undo that separation, even in the face of war.</p><h4 id="HPlan2013-1" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Plan –</span></h4><h4 id="HTheUnitedStatesFederalGovernmentshouldrequireCongressionalauthorizationpriortoinitiatingoffensiveuseofmilitaryforce.-2" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>The United States Federal Government should require Congressional authorization prior to initiating offensive use of military force.</span></h4><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HPlan2019stheperfectbalancethatcheckstheExecutivebutpreservesdefensivecapabilities-2" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Plan’s the perfect balance that checks the Executive but preserves defensive capabilities</span></h4><p><strong>Lobel 8</strong> – Jules Lobel, Professor at University of Pittsburgh Law School, "War Powers for the 21st Century: The Constitutional Perspective", Testimony Before the Subcommittee on International Organizations, Human Rights and Oversight Committee on Foreign Affairs U.S. House of Representatives, 4-10, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://democrats.foreignaffairs.house.gov/110/lob041008.htm  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://democrats.foreignaffairs.house.gov/110/lob041008.htm%27" tppabs="http://democrats.foreignaffairs.house.gov/110/lob041008.htm"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://democrats.foreignaffairs.house.gov/110/lob041008.htm</span></a></span></p><p>III Revising the War Powers Resolution<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that it is necessary and possible to reform the War Powers Resolution, and that H.R.

In light of the abuses that have taken place under the Bush administration, it is the responsibility of a new administration to insist on transparency in the drafting of new legislation.<br/>There is a long history of attempts to revise the War Powers Resolution. As new legislation is drafted, though, it will be important to focus on the central constitutional issues. Much time has been spent in debating how to address contingencies. It will be impossible to write into law any comprehensive formula for every conceivable situation, though; much more important will be establishing the fundamental principles of reform:<br/>The War Powers Resolution should explicitly prohibit executive acts of war without previous Congressional authorization. The only exception should be the executive’s power in an emergency to use short-term force to repel sudden attacks on US territories, troops or citizens.<br/>It is true that many potential conflict situations will be murky, complicated or divisive, and that quick congressional action may not always be forthcoming. Yet, history shows the folly of launching wars that are not supported by the American people. The United States should not use military force until a substantial consensus develops in Congress and the public that military force is necessary, appropriate and wise.<br/>Today, as in 1787, the reality is that the interests of the people <br/>AND<br/>disguised as preemptive war, has no place in constitutional or international law.</p><h3 id="HContention22014-Warfighting-2" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Contention 2 —- Warfighting</span></h3><h4 id="HPowerprojectionstructurallyfailsbecauseoperationsareguidedbyincoherentstrategiesdisconnectedfromnationalpoliticalwill-3" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Power projection structurally fails because operations are guided by incoherent strategies disconnected from national political will</span></h4><p><strong>Gallagher 11</strong> – Lieutenant Colonel Joseph V.

Article II <br/>AND<br/>. Consequently, considerable power has flowed from Congress to the president.50<br/>Execution of US foreign policy is fraught with political uncertainty and vulnerability. Compared to <br/>AND<br/>to oversee the nation’s foreign policy has exposed America to unacceptable strategic risk.<br/>War, Strategy, and the Constitution<br/>One of Clausewitz’ greatest contributions to the study of war is his emphasis on the <br/>AND<br/>political dimension despite the recent emergence of nonstate actors and transnational groups.56<br/>In other words, success at the tactical level of war first requires careful preparations <br/>AND<br/>political objectives, and commitment of resources sufficient to achieve strategic objectives.58<br/>Since 1945, the United States has built the world’s most capable war-fighting machine. So why, then, have most of the nation’s large military interventions since World War II ended in defeat or, at best, stalemate? Political leaders should attend more to what Clausewitz calls the political dimensions of war—national unity and the political value of the objective—as inseparable from national and military strategy.<br/>War theorists have long emphasized the importance of national unity and the political value of <br/>AND<br/>mobilized for war, we must first examine our own political aim."60<br/>National unity underwrites the commitment the nation needs to successfully prosecute war, provided the <br/>AND<br/>, and the will and support of Congress to support the war.62<br/>A Risk to Strategy<br/>As the practice of declaring war has become passé, American strategy has likewise become <br/>AND<br/>63 This connection, Clausewitz observed, is necessary for success in war.<br/>For example, US strategy following World War II ironically came to resemble the German <br/>AND<br/>which has little tolerance for long, risky, or uncertain conflicts.65<br/>More recently, as the executive branch exercises greater authority in directing military interventions, <br/>AND<br/>American people’s collective will in their efforts to subvert our national strategy.67<br/>Vietnam Strategy<br/>The tragic military and political experience of Vietnam was spawned by an aggressive president promoting <br/>AND<br/>, failing to determine strategic objectives and the means to obtain them.70<br/>President Johnson made numerous decisions concerning the strategy and operations of the war, resulting in a strategy of incremental gradualism. Despite some tactical successes, Vietnam strategy never developed sufficient coherence nor the sustained support of the American people. Through executive design, Congress and the people never fully vetted the value of the political objective in the context of large-scale military intervention before President Johnson committed forces to combat.71<br/>As a result, President Johnson lacked the top cover of a war declaration. <br/>AND<br/>the American people; they could not have cared less about Vietnam.73<br/>Afghanistan and Iraq Strategies<br/>The strategies for the ongoing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan have both failed to properly incorporate national strategic ends, ways, and means in a consistent manner across the whole of government. In the absence of a national consensus on strategic ends, Congressman James Marshall (D-GA) not surprisingly identified:<br/>The mismatches among the needs of post-conflict stability operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, the size and the types of military forces available, and the pitiful scarcity of capability in the civilian branches of our government to effect nation-building efforts, as well as, our utter incompetence as a government in strategic communications.74<br/>US Afghanistan strategy has continually morphed from 2001 to the present. The sweeping language <br/>AND<br/>support for the effort when the strategy did not unfold as planned.78<br/>Eventually, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and their strategies became focal points in <br/>AND<br/>exposing the strategies to additional, unnecessary risk at a crucial time.79<br/>Another Cry for Reform<br/>In 2009, The National War Powers Commission, a bipartisan group commissioned under the <br/>AND<br/>declaration for "large" force deployments and "significant armed conflict."81<br/>The Commission recommended replacing the 1973 WPR with the War Powers Consultation Act of 2009 <br/>AND<br/>deploying forces into significant armed conflict without the full blessing of Congress.83<br/>Conclusion<br/>Reminiscent of the 1973 WPR, the National War Powers Commission’s effort to redress war <br/>AND<br/>resulted in the expenditure of national blood and treasure for strategically hollow ends.<br/>The Constitution is, in itself, a strategic national security document.

Once this action continued beyond his original definition of "days, not weeks," into months and months, he did not seek the approval of Congress to continue military activities.

CONSENSUS IS ESSENTIAL TO NATIONAL COHESION<br/>The case for active, continuing congressional engagement on the many issues of high policy presented by an open-ended campaign against terrorism does not rest on an instinct for institutional self-aggrandizement. It is grounded in the critical need to forge and maintain America’s social cohesion as a nation caught up in war. War, especially prolonged war, always poses the risk of depleting that cohesion, so vital to domestic harmony and international effectiveness.<br/>Members of Congress should also realize how essential their involvement is to the morale and <br/>AND<br/>parallel, policy-centered procedures outlined here would serve that same need.<br/>Congress’s stand on how our nation uses the mighty arsenal at its disposal also bears <br/>AND<br/>when he acts "pursuant to an explicit or implied authorization of Congress."<br/>Marshaling international coalitions to wage the war on terrorism will depend importantly on giving our allies confidence that American power is guided and restrained by a disciplined relationship between Congress and President. Absent attentive, persistent congressional involvement, public diplomacy in the war on terrorism could lose much of the credibility that arises from the perception of America as a model of representative government.<br/>There is thus an enduring necessity to balance executive potency in military endeavors with the legislative review that provides democratic legitimacy. The challenge is not to enchain the presidency but to harness both branches to common purpose. On that insight the War Powers Resolution was founded, and in that insight may be found the germ of other innovations to guarantee that Congress will play its proper constitutional role in the war on terrorism.</p><h4 id="HEffectivepowerprojectionstopshotspotescalationtonuclearwar-3" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Effective power projection stops hotspot escalation to nuclear war</span></h4><p><strong>Kagan 7</strong> – Frederick Kagan, Resident Scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, and Michael O’Hanlon, Senior Fellow and Sydney Stein Jr. Chair in Foreign Policy Studies at the Brookings Institution, "The Case for Larger Ground Forces", Stanley Foundation Report, April, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://stanleyfoundation.org/publications/other/Kagan_OHanlon_07.pdf  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://stanleyfoundation.org/publications/other/Kagan_OHanlon_07.pdf%27" tppabs="http://stanleyfoundation.org/publications/other/Kagan_OHanlon_07.pdf"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://stanleyfoundation.org/publications/other/Kagan_OHanlon_07.pdf</span></a></span></p><p>We live at a time when wars not only rage in nearly every region but <br/>AND<br/>position to lead the way in countering major challenges to the global order.<br/>Let us highlight the threats and their consequences with a few concrete examples, emphasizing <br/>AND<br/>forces on offer, the bloodletting will probably, tragically, continue unabated.<br/>And as bad as things are in Iraq today, they could get worse. <br/>AND<br/>moment, although a major Taliban offensive appears to be in the offing.<br/>Sound US grand strategy must proceed from the recognition that, over the next few <br/>AND<br/>personnelintensive missions such as the ones now under way in Iraq and Afghanistan.<br/>Let us hope there will be no such large-scale missions for a while<br/>AND<br/>Such a measure is not only prudent, it is also badly overdue.</p><h4 id="HExecutivewarpowerruinssoftpowerandglobalalliances-3" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Executive war power ruins soft power and global alliances</span></h4><p><strong>Schiffer 9</strong> – Adam Schiffer, Ph.D., Assistant Professor of Political Science at Texas Christian University, and Carrie Liu Currier, Ph.D., Assistant Professor of Political Science at Texas Christian University, "War Powers, International Alliances, the President, and Congress", <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/repository/US_Gov_Balance_of_Power_SF.pdf  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/repository/US_Gov_Balance_of_Power_SF.pdf%27" tppabs="http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/repository/US_Gov_Balance_of_Power_SF.pdf"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/repository/US_Gov_Balance_of_Power_SF.pdf</span></a></span></p><p>The president’s advantages over Congress in the foreign policy realm have consequences far beyond the <br/>AND<br/>the second Bush administration has raised alarm in many countries around the world.<br/>In the past, the bipolar nature of the international system and the lack of <br/>AND<br/>presidential authority led to very disparate degrees of support from the international community.<br/>These two examples of U.S. military action in the Middle East offer <br/>AND<br/>was acknowledged as within the acceptable parameters as determined by the global community.<br/>In contrast, the 2003 war in Iraq did not gain the support of the <br/>AND<br/>other actors to give legitimacy to the U.S.-led war.<br/>The battle between the unilateralists and multilateralists with regard to U.S. foreign <br/>AND<br/>and how they are used to establish the legitimacy of American foreign policy.</p><h4 id="HGroundinguseofforceinconstitutionally-basedSOPcreatesaperceptionofbenignhegemonyandencouragesinternationalcooperationbasedonruleoflaw-2" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Grounding use of force in constitutionally-based SOP creates a perception of benign hegemony and encourages international cooperation based on rule of law</span></h4><p>Ikenberry 1 – G.

We have more than 4,300 treaties and international agreements, two-thirds of which have been entered into in the past 25 years.... Each one of which at least limits our freedom of action.

"Law is a process by which we increase our range of freedom" and "we are constantly enlarging our freedom by being able to predict what others are going to do." ~6~ The United States gets a more predictable environment and more willing partners.<br/>There have been many moments when Asian and European allies have complained about the heavy-handedness of U.S. foreign policy, but the open and institutionalized character of the American order has minimized the possibilities of hegemonic excess over the long term.

The unipolar moment will pass. In facing this circumstance, American grand strategy should be informed by answers to this question: What sort of international order would we like to see in place in 2020 or 2030 when America is less powerful?<br/>Grand strategy is a set of coordinated and sustained policies designed to address the long<br/>AND<br/>States will need to return to the great tasks of liberal order building.<br/>It is useful to distinguish between two types of grand strategy: positional and milieu <br/>AND<br/>the future, this milieu-based approach to grand strategy is necessary.<br/>The United States does not face the sort of singular geopolitical threat that it did <br/>AND<br/>as the foundations of American national security, would be put at risk.<br/>What unites these threats and challenges is that they are all manifestations of rising security <br/>AND<br/>this unusually diverse, diffuse, and unpredictable array of threats and challenges.<br/>This is why a milieu-based grand strategy is attractive. The objective is <br/>AND<br/>its networks of social relations, that are available for solving collective problems.<br/>If American grand strategy is to be organized around liberal order building, what are <br/>AND<br/>, etc.—these safeguards are the stuff of a protective global infrastructure.<br/>Second, the United States should recommit to and rebuild its security alliances. The <br/>AND<br/>legally binding one, and in exchange it gets cooperation and political support.<br/>Third, the United States should reform and create encompassing global institutions that foster and <br/>AND<br/>grows rapidly when their governments can stand behind a UN-sanctioned action.<br/>Fourth, the United States should accommodate and institution-ally engage China. China <br/>AND<br/>has no choice but to join it and seek to prosper within it.<br/>The United States should also be seeking to construct a regional security order in East <br/>AND<br/>institutional arrangements in East Asia that will tie China to the wider region.<br/>Fifth, the United States should reclaim a liberal internationalist public philosophy. When American <br/>AND<br/>American elites as they make trade-offs between sovereignty and institutional cooperation.<br/>Under this philosophy, the restraint and the commitment of American power went hand in hand. Global rules and institutions advanced America’s national interest rather than threatened it. The alternative public philosophies that have circulated in recent years—philosophies that champion American unilateralism and disentanglement from global rules and institutions—did not meet with great success. So an opening exists for America’s postwar vision of internationalism to be updated and rearticulated today.<br/>The United States should embrace the tenets of this liberal public philosophy: Lead with <br/>AND<br/>and let the global system itself do the deep work of liberal modernization.<br/>As it navigates this brave new world, the United States will find itself needing <br/>AND<br/>liberal order building, it can begin the process of gaining it back.</p><h3 id="HContention32014-SOP-2" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Contention 3 —- SOP</span></h3><h4 id="HUncheckedwarpowersetsaprecedentthatcausestheexecutivetobroadlyignoreCongressionalcontrols-3" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Unchecked war power sets a precedent that causes the executive to broadly ignore Congressional controls</span></h4><p><strong>Barron 8</strong> – David J.

Meigs’s subsequent ~*985~ report recommended that an aqueduct be built just above Great Falls, north of Washington. Congress approved that recommendation, and the Department of War began work on the aqueduct, led by Meigs himself. For several years, things ran very smoothly. In the Buchanan Administration, however, Meigs’s relationship with Secretary of War John Floyd turned sour: Floyd dismissed Meigs and made sure the Administration’s proposed budget included no funds for work on the aqueduct. Meigs subject to legislatively imposed restrictions. As we have seen, Presidents have long operated on just that assumption, and they have adjusted their actions accordingly - and in ways that cannot be said to have clearly imperiled the nation. Thus the history undermines assertions about the inherent or inevitable unmanageability or dangers of recognizing legislative control over the conduct of war.

As John Locke tells us:<br/>It may be too great a temptation to human frailty apt to grasp at power <br/>AND<br/>rest of the community, contrary to the ends of society and government.<br/>Madison, Hamilton, and Locke sum up the fears expressed by many over the exercises of power by President Bush in the war on terror. As one prominent critic put it, President Bush is trying to "eliminate nearly all the checks and balances that have been traditionally understood to limit the power of the president."18<br/>The power to declare war, when properly understood, provides Congress with a powerful <br/>AND<br/>over appropriations ensures that Congress can always end a conflict it deems unwise.<br/>Rather, a declaration of war is about acknowledging the severity of a threat to <br/>AND<br/>and the president did not need expanded domestic powers to prosecute the wars.<br/>By contrast, while the war on terror does have components that look like traditional <br/>AND<br/>branch of American government. The power to declare war provides that check.<br/>Understanding the declare war clause along these lines clearly separates potential armed conflicts into distinct <br/>AND<br/>used and what powers can be called upon to support the military effort.<br/>In a perfect war:<br/>One whole nation is at war with another whole nation; and all the members of the nation declaring war are authorized to commit hostilities against all the members of the other, in every place, and under every circumstance. In such a war all the members act under a general authority, and all the rights and consequences of war attach to their condition.20<br/>In a perfect war, the entire energy of the nation is directed towards the effort, while an imperfect war is fought in a more ~End Page 6~ limited manner. Justice Chase’s concurrence in Bas explains the limitations that result from a war being imperfect:<br/>Congress has not declared war in general terms, but Congress has authorized hostilities on <br/>AND<br/>only to citizens appointed by commissions or exposed to immediate outrage and violence.<br/>A war of the formally declared, or perfect, type involves a level and <br/>AND<br/>for food and materiel, or even intern large numbers of American citizens.<br/>When the country is not in a state of perfect war by virtue of a <br/>AND<br/>power to take over the mills and force them to produce steel.21<br/>Despite Truman’s claim of inherent authority and military necessity, the seizure of the mills was struck down as it was, according to Justice Black’s opinion, "lawmaking, a legislative function which the Constitution has expressly confided to the Congress and not to the President. … In the framework of our Constitution, the President’s power to see that the laws are faithfully executed refutes the idea that he is to be a lawmaker."22 Furthermore:<br/>The order cannot properly be sustained as an exercise of the President’s military power as <br/>AND<br/>a job for the Nation’s lawmakers, not for its military authorities.23<br/>When the president wants to take, pursuant to his powers as commander-in<br/>AND<br/>terrorist organizations, or change the rules governing the procedures for military commissions.<br/>In wartime, however, it may be neither expedient nor strategically sound for the <br/>AND<br/>Congress time and time again to enact laws to advance the war effort.<br/>The declarations of war for World Wars I and II both contain specific, particular<br/>AND<br/>than when using force in a less comprehensive manner during a limited conflict.<br/>"All the resources of the government" and "all of the resources of <br/>AND<br/>congressional legislation, there are still certain constitutional guarantees that cannot be ignored.<br/>In the narrow interpretation advanced by the Bush administration, the trigger for the president’s <br/>AND<br/>in the balance of powers between the president and Congress in wartime."27<br/>This argument is unsatisfying on two grounds.
