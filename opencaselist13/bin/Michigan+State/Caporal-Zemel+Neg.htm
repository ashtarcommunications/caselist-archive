Rather than repeating those arguments, this amicus¶ brief seeks to add perspective to the reasons why suits like the present action would threaten¶ national security by interfering with ongoing military operations. Allowing this case to proceed¶ would contravene the core military principle of "unity of command," and undermine the¶ military’s chain of command, creating uncertainty for subordinate leaders and soldiers. Such¶ litigation also would adversely affect unit cohesion, the glue which binds small units together in¶ the heat of battle, and enables them to survive and accomplish their missions. Further, litigation¶ of cases such as this would undermine battlefield decisionmaking by subjecting tactical,¶ operational and strategic decisions to second-guessing by courts far removed from the battlefield.¶ And, to the extent this case will involve the activities of special operations forces, the VFW¶ urges the Court to tread with particular caution, because of the need to protect the extremely¶ sensitive sources and methods utilized by our nation’s elite forces. ARGUMENT¶ ALLOWING THIS TYPE OF SUIT TO PROCEED WOULD SERIOUSLY IMPAIR¶ NATIONAL SECURITY AND U.S. MILITARY OPERATIONS OVERSEAS¶ "Without doubt, our Constitution recognizes that core strategic matters of warmaking¶ belong in the hands of those who are best positioned and most politically accountable for making¶ them." Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U.S. 507, 531 (2004), citing Department of Navy v. Egan, 484¶ U.S. 518, 530 (1988); see also Youngstown Sheet 26 Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 587¶ (1952) (acknowledging "broad powers in military commanders engaged in day-to-day fighting in¶ a theater of war"). As veterans of this nation’s wars, the VFW’s members urge this Court to¶ leave such matters in the hands of the President and Congress, because allowing this suit to¶ proceed would undermine core military institutions such as the chain of command and unit¶ cohesion.¶ A. Adjudication Of This Case Would Compromise The Military Principle Of¶ "Unity Of Command," And Undermine The Chain Of Command¶ "Unity of command," and its corollary, "unity of effort," are fundamental principles of¶ warfare which are central to the effectiveness of Western militaries. See Carl von Clausewitz,¶ On War 200-210 (Michael Howard 26 Peter Paret, ed. and trans., Princeton University Press¶ 1976) (1832) (hereinafter "Clausewitz"). There "is no higher and simpler law of strategy" than¶ to apply this principle in order to concentrate a nation’s military power its adversaries’ "center of¶ gravity." Id. at 204. This principle was first embraced by the American military during the 19th¶ Century, and has subsequently shaped the organizational structure of American warfighting¶ through two world wars and countless other conflicts. See James F. Schnabel, History of the¶ Joints Chiefs of Staff, Vol. 1 at 80-87 (1996); Russell F. Weigley, History of the United States¶ Army at 422-423 (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1984). Unity of command requires the integration of all combat functions into a single organizational element, with command¶ authority vested in a single individual.

That <br/>AND<br/>, cornering the market on public fear, and capturing the news spotlight. <br/>We must ask ourselves what biological threats pose the greatest danger to our families. <br/>AND<br/>annual diseases like drug-resistant staph infections and garden-variety influenza. <br/>Now the government assesses the relative likelihood and consequences of bioweapons, pandemic flu, <br/>AND<br/>a combined risk assessment makes sense to determine a health hazard’s true impact. <br/>As earlier, we’re using the term "risk" as an indicator of the <br/>AND<br/>per year, an annual death toll greater than that of AIDS. 2<br/>&nbsp;Let’s add into the mix the possibility of a pandemic flu, now a <br/>AND<br/>do so from a fund of limited resources that we must spend efficiently. <br/>Without a data-based ballpark calculation of the threat and size of a new <br/>AND<br/>scenario will replay. "But this time it will be worse." 4 <br/>Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, agrees. He foresees a toll of some 270 million pandemic flu deaths worldwide, a number he arrived at simply by extrapolating the 1918 death toll of 40 million to the world’s current population. 5 <br/>Scary stuff, but now listen to Paul Offit of Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. He says of avian flu, "the virus is clearly not so highly contagious among mammals, and I just don’t think it’s going to become so." 6 Moreover, Offit does not expect the next pandemic until sometime around 2025.<br/>The WHO itself takes a conservative position, estimating that a new pandemic would take the lives of from 2 million to 7.4 million people, believing that the 1918 pandemic was unusual and unlikely to be repeated. 7 <br/>We will try to make rational risk assessments about pandemic flu and anthrax as best <br/>AND<br/>such probabilities. 9 But what does each one mean in everyday terms? <br/>Our intuitive method involves simply thinking about the number of years that must go by to have a 50– 50 chance of such an attack, given its probability in any one year. Table 8.1 offers some examples. <br/>To set the probability of such an anthrax attack at 0.1 would mean <br/>AND<br/>the 30,000 fatalities that would mark an extremely successful bioweapons attack.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HNopandemicorextinction2013historyproves" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>No pandemic or extinction – history proves</span></h4><p><strong>Easterbrook, 3</strong> (Gregg, Senior Fellow – New Republic, "We’re All Gonna Die21", Wired Magazine, July, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.07/doomsday.html?pg=126topic=26topic_set=)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.07/doomsday.html?pg=126topic=26topic_set=)%27" tppabs="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.07/doomsday.html?pg=126topic=26topic_set=)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.07/doomsday.html?pg=126topic=26topic_set=)</span></a></span></p><p>3.

Nature was described as primeval, fragile, and at risk of collapse from too much human use and abuse. And indeed, there are consequences when humans convert landscapes for mining, logging, intensive agriculture, and urban development and when key species or ecosystems are lost.<br/>But ecologists and conservationists have grossly overstated the fragility of nature, frequently arguing that <br/>AND<br/>as a threat to the delicate inner-workings of our planetary ecosystem.<br/>The fragility trope dates back, at least, to Rachel Carson, who wrote <br/>AND<br/>poor, ecosystem degradation was simultaneously putting systems in jeopardy of collapse.24<br/>The trouble for conservation is that the data simply do not support the idea of <br/>AND<br/>sea cow to the dodo, with no catastrophic or even measurable effects.<br/>These stories of resilience are not isolated examples — a thorough review of the scientific literature identified 240 studies of ecosystems following major disturbances such as deforestation, mining, oil spills, and other types ?of pollution. The abundance of plant and animal species as well as other measures of ecosystem function recovered, at least partially, in 173 (72 percent) of these studies.25<br/>While global forest cover is continuing to decline, it is rising in the Northern <br/>AND<br/>been found in surprising numbers in oil palm plantations and degraded lands.28<br/>Nature is so resilient that it can recover rapidly from even the most powerful human <br/>AND<br/>Mexico was degraded and consumed by bacteria at a remarkably fast rate.31<br/>Today, coyotes roam downtown Chicago, and peregrine falcons astonish San Franciscans as they <br/>AND<br/>?to an audience somehow addicted to stories of collapse and environmental apocalypse.<br/>Even that classic symbol of fragility — the polar bear, seemingly stranded on a <br/>AND<br/>of new environments only to be at risk when the environment changes again.<br/>The wilderness ideal presupposes that there are parts of the world untouched by humankind, but today it is impossible to find a place on Earth that is unmarked by human activity. The truth is humans have been impacting their natural environment for centuries. The wilderness so beloved by conservationists — places "untrammeled by man"34 — never existed, at least not in the last thousand years, and arguably even longer.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HBiodiversityisresilientandinevitable" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Biodiversity is resilient and inevitable</span></h4><p><strong>Sagoff 8</strong> (Mark, Senior Research Scholar @ Institute for Philosophy and Public Policy @ School of Public Policy @ U.

Numerous segments of Iraq’s body politic — Kurdish, Sunni Arab, and Shia — are exasperated over the government’s inability to address political or economic inequities, and are talking seriously about partition.<br/>On April 23, the federal military miscalculated when its raid on a protest site <br/>AND<br/>that evokes Sunni Arab fears of the Shia-led government in Baghdad.<br/>The resurgence of violence since 2010 is shown very clearly in the metrics used to <br/>AND<br/>-U.S. targeting with Iraqi-on-Iraqi violence.<br/>So what happens next?

For their own diverse reasons, almost every actor working in Iraq today — the opposition, the Turks, even the Iranians — would welcome a less divisive government in Baghdad. In other words, the effort stands a chance of success.<br/>The experiment of building a new strongman in Baghdad has not yielded a more stable Iraq.

Numerous segments of Iraq’s body politic — Kurdish, Sunni Arab, and Shia — are exasperated over the government’s inability to address political or economic inequities, and are talking seriously about partition.<br/>On April 23, the federal military miscalculated when its raid on a protest site <br/>AND<br/>that evokes Sunni Arab fears of the Shia-led government in Baghdad.<br/>The resurgence of violence since 2010 is shown very clearly in the metrics used to <br/>AND<br/>-U.S. targeting with Iraqi-on-Iraqi violence.<br/>So what happens next?

For example, the Boston perpetrators were clearly not suicidal, which is the standard in American cases. In only six of the earlier plots were the perpetrators clearly willing to die in their terrorist effort.<br/>And except for their ability to fabricate and detonate bombs, the Boston terrorists do <br/>AND<br/>individuals picked up on terrorism charges in the United States since those attacks.<br/>In describing the "adversary," the case studies far more commonly use words like incompetent, ineffective, unintelligent, idiotic, ignorant, inadequate, unorganized, misguided, muddled, amateurish, dopey, unrealistic, moronic, irrational, foolish, and gullible. Many of the cases suggest that there is little exaggeration in the 2010 film, Four Lions, the impressive dark comedy about a band of hapless home-grown British terrorists.<br/>Amazingly, the Boston perpetrators apparently thought they could somehow get away with their deed <br/>AND<br/>inability to explain how killing a few random people would advance their cause.)<br/>The Boston perpetrators seem never to have ventured much more than a few miles from <br/>AND<br/>which the police applied standard killer-on-the-loose methodology.<br/>And while the scope of the tragedy in Boston should not be minimized, it should also be noted that, if the terrorists’ aim was to kill a large number of people, their bombs failed miserably. As recent cases in Colorado and Connecticut sadly demonstrate, far more fatalities have been inflicted by gunmen.<br/>Concern about "lone wolf" attacks has grown in recent years, and a <br/>AND<br/>count, remains about one in 3 million or 4 million per year.)<br/>It is still unclear what motivated the Boston bombers. We are hearing a lot about "radicalization," a concept that is not only vague but also questionably suggests, as Arun Kundnani has pointed out, that violence is inherent or implied in Muslims who become deeply religious.<br/>Evidence from the 52 cases strongly indicates that assuming an ideological motivation for terrorism is <br/>AND<br/>upon them in the Middle East by the U.S. government.<br/>Rather remarkably, none of the 52 cases after 9/11 has inspired much <br/>AND<br/>venue and the manhunt — is yet to be seen, of course.</p><h4 id="HNoriskofnuclearterror" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>No risk of nuclear terror</span></h4><p><strong>Mueller 10</strong> (John, professor of political science at Ohio State, Calming Our Nuclear Jitters, Issues in Science and Technology, Winter, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.issues.org/26.2/mueller.html)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.issues.org/26.2/mueller.html)%27" tppabs="http://www.issues.org/26.2/mueller.html)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.issues.org/26.2/mueller.html)</span></a></span></p><p>Politicians of all stripes preach to an anxious, appreciative, and very numerous choir <br/>AND<br/>above: one in a million or one in three billion per attempt.</p><h3 id="HAT:RussiaImpact" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>AT: Russia Impact</span></h3><h4 id="HMendelsonprovesaltcauses2013drones2Ctortureandrendition2013theplanisnecessarybutnotsufficient" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Mendelson proves alt causes – drones, torture and rendition – the plan is necessary but not sufficient</span></h4><p>Sarah E. <strong>Mendelson</strong>, Director, Human Rights and Security Initiative, Center for Strategic and International Studies, "U.S.-Russian Relations and the Democracy and Rule of Law Deficit," CENTURY FOUNDATION REPORT, <strong>2009</strong>, p. 3-4.</p><p>Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, every U.S. <br/>AND<br/>hypocrisy and weakness of democracy and human rights norms within the international system.</p><h4 id="HRussianstateactioncan2019tsolveruleoflaw2013Russiancivilsocietytooweak" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Russian state action can’t solve rule of law – Russian civil society too weak</span></h4><p>Kathryn <strong>Hedley</strong> is a professor of law and political science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, <strong>09</strong> ~"Rule of Law: Russian-Style," Current History, October, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27https://media.law.wisc.edu/m/zgyzz/~~  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed using an unsupported protocol (e.g., gopher).  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27https://media.law.wisc.edu/m/zgyzz/~~%27" tppabs="https://media.law.wisc.edu/m/zgyzz/~~"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">https://media.law.wisc.edu/m/zgyzz/~~</span></a></span></p><p>Even so, a more robust rule of law in Russia¶ will require fundamental <br/>AND<br/>augur well for the development of a more¶ robust rule of law.</p><h4 id="HNoRussiancollapse" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>No Russian collapse</span></h4><p>David P <strong>Goldman</strong>, Senior Fellow at the London Center for Policy Research and Associate Fellow at the Middle East Forum, <strong>13</strong> ~"Reports of Russia’s death are exaggerated," October 15, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Central_Asia/CEN-01-151013.html~~  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Central_Asia/CEN-01-151013.html~~%27" tppabs="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Central_Asia/CEN-01-151013.html~~"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Central_Asia/CEN-01-151013.html~~</span></a></span></p><p>Since the fall of communism in 1991, Washington consistently underestimated Russia.

Speculation has centered on the likelihood that Israel will launch preemptive air strikes against Iran’s nuclear installations, but there is also considerable talk that the United States might join in such strikes or even take on the primary mission to make certain that the key sites are destroyed.<br/>Most advocates of military action against Iran contend that the system of international economic sanctions <br/>AND<br/>he will never allow the emergence of a nuclear Iran on his watch.<br/>The reason that a growing number of politicians and pundits embrace the war option, <br/>AND<br/>Israel has between 150 and 300 nuclear weapons — an extremely credible deterrent.<br/>None of that matters, hawks contend, because the Iranian leadership is not rational <br/>AND<br/>, "mutually assured destruction is not a deterrent.

First, Ahmadinejad is hardly the most <br/>AND<br/>devoting too much time and energy to the issue of the 12th Imam.<br/>Second, the return of the Mahdi in the midst of an apocalypse is scarcely <br/>AND<br/>devout Christian leader who believed Revelations would be tempted to bring about Armageddon.<br/>The reality is that leaders in any political system usually prefer to enjoy the riches <br/>AND<br/>attack that would end their rule and obliterate Iran as a functioning society.<br/>It is appropriate to demand that hawks produce evidence — not just allegations — that deterrence is inapplicable because Iranian leaders are suicidal.

For Washington is setting a precedent whereby states can send drones, often over sovereign borders, to kill foreigners or their own citizens, who are deemed threats. <br/>Other states may also follow Washington’s example and develop their own criteria to define imminent threats and use drones to counter them. <br/>Washington will find it increasingly difficult to protest other nations’ targeted killing programs — particularly when the United States has helped define this lethal practice. U.S. opposition will prove especially difficult when other states justify targeted killings as a matter of domestic affairs. <br/>Should enough states follow the U.S. example, the practice of preemptively targeting and killing suspected threats may develop into customary international law. <br/>Such a norm, however, which requires consistent state practice arising out of a sense of legal obligation, now looks unlikely. While targeted killing policies are arguably executed by states citing a legal obligation to protect themselves from imminent threats, widespread state practice is still uncommon. <br/>But international law does not forbid drones. And given the lack of an international regime to control drones, state and non-state actors are free to determine their future use. <br/>This lack of international consensus about how to control drones stems from a serious contradiction in incentives. Though drones pose grave challenges, they also offer states lethal and non-lethal capabilities that are of great appeal. Because the potential for drone technology is virtually limitless, states are now unwilling to control how drones evolve.</p><h4 id="HChinawon2019tabandondroneusebasedonUSaction-historicallygroundedoutsideUSpractice" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>China won’t abandon drone use based on US action- historically grounded outside US practice</span></h4><p>Kenneth <strong>Anderson 11</strong>, Professor of International Law at American University, 10/9/11, "What Kind of Drones Arms Race Is Coming?," <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.volokh.com/2011/10/09/what-kind-of-drones-arms-race-is-coming/~~23more-51516-http://www.volokh.com/2011/10/09/what-kind-of-drones-arms-race-is-coming/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path excluded from retrieval by the project\%27s Exclusions properties.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.volokh.com/2011/10/09/what-kind-of-drones-arms-race-is-coming/~~23more-51516-http://www.volokh.com/2011/10/09/what-kind-of-drones-arms-race-is-coming/%27" tppabs="http://www.volokh.com/2011/10/09/what-kind-of-drones-arms-race-is-coming/~~23more-51516-http://www.volokh.com/2011/10/09/what-kind-of-drones-arms-race-is-coming/"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.volokh.com/2011/10/09/what-kind-of-drones-arms-race-is-coming/~~23more-51516-http://www.volokh.com/2011/10/09/what-kind-of-drones-arms-race-is-coming/</span></a></span></p><p>It is indeed likely that the future will see more instances of uses of force <br/>AND<br/>this for a long time and thinks it is legally and morally right.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h3 id="HExt.NoDroneWars" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Ext.

Brennan began advising President Obama on the use of unmanned aerial vehicles after being named his counterterrorism adviser in 2009. Brennan’s nomination raises anew the controversies surrounding the targeted killings and the deliberate lack of institutional oversight of these methods.¶ Last fall, the Obama administration was reportedly hard at work codifying its rules for assassination by drone. Organizations like the American Civil Liberties Union had been pressing for such an effort, and it appeared that the administration was at last receptive to their arguments. However, the rules that administration officials were so busily drafting were meant for Mitt Romney, in case he won the election. Rather than leave the decision-making in the hands of a new president, Obama officials had suddenly become aware of the dangers of letting a single, in this case Republican, person make life-or-death decisions.¶ After Obama’s reelection, the administration’s sense of urgency lessened considerably. Now, with Brennan’s nomination, this urgency may have dissipated entirely. Certainly his elevation suggests that the decision-making process behind drone strikes will remain opaque. The man called "the high priest of targeted killing" will keep his exalted position.</p><h4 id="HRestrictionsonObama2019suseofdroneswouldbealoss-likelytovetoanddestroyhimselfpolitically" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Restrictions on Obama’s use of drones would be a loss- likely to veto and destroy himself politically</span></h4><p>Alex <strong>Newman</strong>, Correspondent at The New American magazine since 2007, University of Florida<br/>B.S., Journalism 3-28-<strong>2013</strong> <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/constitution/item/14936-gop-lawmakers-seek-to-restrain-obama-on-killing-americans-http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/constitution/item/14936-gop-lawmakers-seek-to-restrain-obama-on-killing-americans  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path excluded from retrieval by the project\%27s Exclusions properties.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/constitution/item/14936-gop-lawmakers-seek-to-restrain-obama-on-killing-americans-http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/constitution/item/14936-gop-lawmakers-seek-to-restrain-obama-on-killing-americans%27" tppabs="http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/constitution/item/14936-gop-lawmakers-seek-to-restrain-obama-on-killing-americans-http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/constitution/item/14936-gop-lawmakers-seek-to-restrain-obama-on-killing-americans"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/constitution/item/14936-gop-lawmakers-seek-to-restrain-obama-on-killing-americans-http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/constitution/item/14936-gop-lawmakers-seek-to-restrain-obama-on-killing-americans</span></a></span></p><p>Responding to a tsunami of outrage across the political spectrum over the Obama administration’s lawless <br/>AND<br/>All Americans."

Chris Coons (D-Del.) tells the AP. "We are sort of running on the steam that we acquired right after our country was attacked in the most horrific act of terror in U.S. history," agrees Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.). "We have learned much since 9/11, and now it’s time to take a more sober look at where we should be with use of force."¶ One problem for lawmakers, says The New York Times in an editorial, is that when it comes to drone strikes, the Obama team "utterly rejects the idea that Congress or the courts have any right to review such a decision in advance, or even after the fact." Along with citing the law authorizing broad use of force against al Qaeda, the white paper also "argues that judges and Congress don’t have the right to rule on or interfere with decisions made in the heat of combat." And most troublingly, Obama won’t give Congress the classified document detailing the legal justification used to kill American al Qaeda operative Anwar al-Awlaki.¶ Going forward, he should submit decisions like this one to review by Congress and the courts. If necessary, Congress could create a special court to handle this sort of sensitive discussion, like the one it created to review wiretapping. This dispute goes to the fundamental nature of our democracy, to the relationship among the branches of government and to their responsibility to the public. ~New York Times~¶ It’s interesting to watch conservatives show (or at least feign) outrage over a policy that "would have been met with right-wing hosannas under Bush/Cheney," says Steve M. at No More Mister Nice Blog. But even with the grumbling from the Left and Right, "I don’t think any of this is going to stop the drone strikes." ¶ I can’t really see righties and lefties banding together to do something upliftingly democratic and bipartisan like forcing a reconsideration of the policy via combined public pressure (when was the last time something like that happened in America?) — there are too many people in office, from both parties, who like what’s being done by the administration. ~No More Mister Nice Blog~</p><h4 id="HCausesObamabacklash-it2019saslaponthewrist" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Causes Obama backlash- it’s a slap on the wrist</span></h4><p>Jack <strong>Goldsmith</strong> teaches at Harvard Law School and is a member of the Hoover Institution Task Force on National Security and Law, 5-1-<strong>2013</strong> <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.newrepublic.com/article/112964/obamas-secrecy-destroying-american-support-counterterrorism-http://www.newrepublic.com/article/112964/obamas-secrecy-destroying-american-support-counterterrorism  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path excluded from retrieval by the project\%27s Exclusions properties.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.newrepublic.com/article/112964/obamas-secrecy-destroying-american-support-counterterrorism-http://www.newrepublic.com/article/112964/obamas-secrecy-destroying-american-support-counterterrorism%27" tppabs="http://www.newrepublic.com/article/112964/obamas-secrecy-destroying-american-support-counterterrorism-http://www.newrepublic.com/article/112964/obamas-secrecy-destroying-american-support-counterterrorism"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.newrepublic.com/article/112964/obamas-secrecy-destroying-american-support-counterterrorism-http://www.newrepublic.com/article/112964/obamas-secrecy-destroying-american-support-counterterrorism</span></a></span></p><p>Many in Congress want to increase the transparency of the processes and legal standards for placing a suspect (especially an American) on a targeting list, to tighten those legal standards (perhaps by recourse to a "drone court"), and to establish a more open accounting of the consequences (including civilian casualties) from the strikes. "This is now out in the public arena, and now it has to be addressed," Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat, recently said.¶ Others in Congress worry about the obsolescence of the legal foundation for the way of the knife: the congressional authorization, in 2001, of force against Al Qaeda. "I don’t believe many, if any, of us believed when we voted for ~the authorization~ that we were voting for the longest war in the history of the United States and putting a stamp of approval on a war policy against terrorism that, 10 years plus later, we’re still using," said Senator Richard Durbin, also a Democrat, in a Wall Street Journal interview. "What are the checks and balances of the system?" he asked. Senator John McCain, who led bipartisan efforts against what he saw as Bush-era legal excesses, is now focusing similar attention on Obama. "I believe that we need to revisit this whole issue of the use of drones, who uses them, whether the CIA should become their own air force, what the oversight is, ~and~ what the legal and political foundations ~are~ for this kind of conflict," he said last month.¶ These are unhappy developments for the president who in his first inaugural address pledged with supercilious confidence that, unlike his predecessor, he would not expend the "rule of law" for "expedience’s sake." Obama reportedly bristles at the legal and political questions about his secret war, and the lack of presidential trust that they imply. "This is not Dick Cheney we’re talking about here," he recently pleaded to Democratic senators who complained about his administration’s excessive secrecy on drones, according to Politico. And yet the president has ended up in this position because he committed the same sins that led Cheney and the administration in which he served to a similar place.¶ The first sin is an extraordinary institutional secrecy that Obama has long promised to reduce but has failed to. In part this results from any White House’s inevitable tendency to seek maximum protection for its institutional privileges and prerogatives. The administration’s disappointing resistance to sharing secret legal opinions about the secret war with even a small subset of Congress falls into this category.&nbsp;</p><p>AT: Thumper – General (with Iran)</p><h4 id="HNoDemsthumpers2014Obama2019stakeneverythingelseoffthetable" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>No Dems thumpers—Obama’s taken everything else off the table</span></h4><p><strong>WP, 2-22</strong>-2014 <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obama-seeks-to-defuse-tensions-among-democrats/2014/02/22/92e472fc-9b1b-11e3-ad71-e03637a299c0_story.html-http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obama-seeks-to-defuse-tensions-among-democrats/2014/02/22/92e472fc-9b1b-11e3-ad71-e03637a299c0_story.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path excluded from retrieval by the project\%27s Exclusions properties.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obama-seeks-to-defuse-tensions-among-democrats/2014/02/22/92e472fc-9b1b-11e3-ad71-e03637a299c0_story.html-http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obama-seeks-to-defuse-tensions-among-democrats/2014/02/22/92e472fc-9b1b-11e3-ad71-e03637a299c0_story.html%27" tppabs="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obama-seeks-to-defuse-tensions-among-democrats/2014/02/22/92e472fc-9b1b-11e3-ad71-e03637a299c0_story.html-http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obama-seeks-to-defuse-tensions-among-democrats/2014/02/22/92e472fc-9b1b-11e3-ad71-e03637a299c0_story.html"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obama-seeks-to-defuse-tensions-among-democrats/2014/02/22/92e472fc-9b1b-11e3-ad71-e03637a299c0_story.html-http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obama-seeks-to-defuse-tensions-among-democrats/2014/02/22/92e472fc-9b1b-11e3-ad71-e03637a299c0_story.html</span></a></span></p><p>President Obama is stepping up his efforts to coalesce and energize the Democratic base for the 2014 elections, backing off on issues where his positions might alienate the left, and more aggressively singling out Republicans as being responsible for the country’s problems. Voter turnout in midterm elections tends to be much lighter than it is in years when the country is picking a president, which means that it is crucial to maximize the enthusiasm of the party stalwarts who are most likely to show up at the polls. That helps explain why, in several sensitive policy areas, Obama recently has moved to defuse tensions with his fellow Democrats. Liberals are celebrating the president’s decision not to include a proposal to trim Social Security benefits in his 2015 budget, abandoning his previous stance in favor of making that part of a larger "grand bargain" to bring down the national debt. And while the White House insists that it will continue to press Congress for more authority to negotiate trade deals — something that puts the administration at odds with the Democratic base, and with its own party’s congressional leaders — Vice President Biden this month signaled to House Democrats that it has no expectation that will actually happen. Nor is the administration showing much appetite for bringing about a resolution to the question of allowing construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, an issue that pits environmentalists against unions, both of which the Democrats will be counting on in November. A Nebraska judge’s decision on Wednesday rejecting the pipeline route in that state has raised the possibility that a decision may be delayed until after the election.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HObama2019sstayingoutofit" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Obama’s staying out of it</span></h4><p><strong>AP, 3-15</strong>-2014 <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://news.yahoo.com/obama-seeks-stay-neutral-cia-senate-spat-074133649  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://news.yahoo.com/obama-seeks-stay-neutral-cia-senate-spat-074133649%27" tppabs="http://news.yahoo.com/obama-seeks-stay-neutral-cia-senate-spat-074133649"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://news.yahoo.com/obama-seeks-stay-neutral-cia-senate-spat-074133649</span></a></span>—politics.<span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://opencaselist13.paperlessdebate.com/bin/Michigan+State/html-http://news.yahoo.com/obama-seeks-stay-neutral-cia-senate-spat-074133649~-~-politics.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path excluded from retrieval by the project\%27s Exclusions properties.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://opencaselist13.paperlessdebate.com/bin/Michigan+State/html-http://news.yahoo.com/obama-seeks-stay-neutral-cia-senate-spat-074133649~-~-politics.html%27" tppabs="http://opencaselist13.paperlessdebate.com/bin/Michigan+State/html-http://news.yahoo.com/obama-seeks-stay-neutral-cia-senate-spat-074133649~-~-politics.html"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">html-http://news.yahoo.com/obama-seeks-stay-neutral-cia-senate-spat-074133649~-~-politics.html</span></a></span></p><p>For President Barack Obama, a public spat between his trusted ally at the CIA and a loyal Democratic senator has put into sharp focus his complicated role in managing the post-Sept. 11 anti-terror programs he inherited from George W. Bush. The president wants to stay neutral in the feud that erupted last week between Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and CIA Director John Brennan, who served as Obama’s top counterterrorism adviser before being tapped to lead the spy agency. Feinstein accused the CIA of illegally searching computers the Senate Intelligence Committee used to study documents related to the harsh interrogation techniques the agency employed after the 2001 terror attacks. In brief comments on the dispute, Obama said taking sides was "not something that is an appropriate role for me and the White House to wade into at this point." Staying out of the fray may prove difficult for Obama, given that he’s already entwined with the issue at the core of the dispute: What kind of public reckoning should there be for those who carried out waterboarding and other harsh interrogation methods? Even as Obama was publicly declaring his neutrality in the dispute between Feinstein and Brennan, he dispatched his chief of staff, Denis McDonough, and top lawyer Kathryn Ruemmler to Capitol Hill to meet with the California senator.</p><h4 id="HKickedthecandowntheroad" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Kicked the can down the road</span></h4><p><strong>Epstein</strong>, Politico, <strong>3-12</strong>-14 Jennifer, "Barack Obama weighs in on Senate-CIA flap" <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=046E32A3-4448-43A0-A91E-7719DA45A19F  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=046E32A3-4448-43A0-A91E-7719DA45A19F%27" tppabs="http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=046E32A3-4448-43A0-A91E-7719DA45A19F"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=046E32A3-4448-43A0-A91E-7719DA45A19F</span></a></span>, accessed 3-13-14, TAP</p><p>President Barack Obama defended his administration on Wednesday as the Senate Intelligence Committee and the <br/>AND<br/>the past, and that can help guide us as we move forward."</p><h4 id="HMcCainshields." class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>McCain shields.</span></h4><p><strong>Bolton</strong>, The Hill, <strong>3-11</strong>-14<br/>Alexander, "CIA fallout reaches Obama" <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/200524-obama-will-have-to-deal-with-the-fallout  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/200524-obama-will-have-to-deal-with-the-fallout%27" tppabs="http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/200524-obama-will-have-to-deal-with-the-fallout"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/200524-obama-will-have-to-deal-with-the-fallout</span></a></span>, accessed 3-14-14, TAP</p><p>McCain, Obama’s adversary in the 2008 presidential election, could give the president some political cover to intervene. He said there should be "repercussions" if Feinstein’s allegations are proved correct. "It is very disturbing and we need a thorough and complete investigation, and I’m trying to figure out who would be doing it because there’s allegations of bias on both sides," he said. McCain, a longtime critic of enhanced interrogation tactics such as waterboarding, said, "We may need some kind of independent investigation." Graham, McCain’s ally, said if the spying allegations are true, "heads should roll at the CIA." Reid, however, said it’s too early to talk about setting up a special committee to investigate Feinstein’s claims. "We’re about 14 steps away from that," he said.</p><p>PC Theory True – General</p><h4 id="HConsensusofstudies" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Consensus of studies</span></h4><p>Anthony J. <strong>Madonna</strong>¶ Assistant Professor¶ University of Georgia, <strong>et al</strong> Richard L.

Demands to raise legal standards for terrorist suspects in one arena often lead to compensating tactics in another arena that leave suspects (and, sometimes, innocent civilians) worse off. The U.S. rendition program -- which involves capturing suspected terrorists and whisking them to another country, outside judicial process -- began in the 1990s. The government was under pressure to take terrorists off the streets and learn what they knew. But it could not bring them to the United States because U.S. law made it too hard to effectively interrogate and incapacitate them here. So instead it shipped them to Egypt and other places to achieve the same end. A similar phenomenon has occurred with the U.S. detention of terrorist suspects at Guantanamo Bay. The Gitmo facility was established after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks because the Bush administration believed it needed to apply a different detention and interrogation regime than would be allowed at home. Over the past eight years, courts have exported U.S. legal standards to the island, and now President Obama has promised to close the detention facility. But closing Guantanamo or bringing American justice there does not end the problem of terrorist detention. It simply causes the government to address the problem in different ways. A little-noticed consequence of elevating standards at Guantanamo is that the government has sent very few terrorist suspects there in recent years. Instead, it holds more terrorists -- without charge or trial, without habeas rights, and with less public scrutiny -- at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan. Or it renders them to countries where interrogation and incarceration standards are often even lower. The cat-and-mouse game does not end there. As detentions at Bagram and traditional renditions have come under increasing legal and political scrutiny, the Bush and Obama administrations have relied more on other tactics. They have secured foreign intelligence services to do all the work -- capture, incarceration and interrogation -- for all but the highest-level detainees. And they have increasingly employed targeted killings, a tactic that eliminates the need to interrogate or incarcerate terrorists but at the cost of killing or maiming suspected terrorists and innocent civilians alike without notice or due process. There are at least two problems with this general approach to incapacitating terrorists. First, it is not ideal for security. Sometimes it would be more useful for the United States to capture and interrogate a terrorist (if possible) than to kill him with a Predator drone. Often the United States could get better information if it, rather than another country, detained and interrogated a terrorist suspect. Detentions at Guantanamo are more secure than detentions in Bagram or in third countries. The second problem is that terrorist suspects often end up in less favorable places. Detainees in Bagram have fewer rights than prisoners at Guantanamo, and many in Middle East and South Asian prisons have fewer yet. Likewise, most detainees would rather be in one of these detention facilities than be killed by a Predator drone. We congratulate ourselves when we raise legal standards for detainees, but in many respects all we are really doing is driving the terrorist incapacitation problem out of sight, to a place where terrorist suspects are treated worse. It is tempting to say that we should end this pattern and raise standards everywhere. Perhaps we should extend habeas corpus globally, eliminate targeted killing and cease cooperating with intelligence services from countries that have poor human rights records. This sentiment, however, is unrealistic. The imperative to stop the terrorists is not going away. The government will find and exploit legal loopholes to ensure it can keep up our defenses. This approach to detention policy reflects a sharp disjunction between the public's view of the terrorist threat and the government's. After nearly eight years without a follow-up attack, the public (or at least an influential sliver) is growing doubtful about the threat of terrorism and skeptical about using the lower-than-normal standards of wartime justice. The government, however, sees the terrorist threat every day and is under enormous pressure to keep the country safe. When one of its approaches to terrorist incapacitation becomes too costly legally or politically, it shifts to others that raise fewer legal and political problems. This doesn't increase our safety or help the terrorists. But it does make us feel better about ourselves.&nbsp;</p><p>B – Means Aff won’t solve… and Outsourced strikes outweigh.</p><p>Byman ‘13<br/>Daniel Byman is a professor in the Security Studies Program of Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service and the research director of the Saban Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution.

The starting point is that when committed in the course of an armed conflict a legal analysis of targeted killing shall be based on all applicable rules of international humanitarian law. In that respect the principle of distinction between civilians and combatants remains of the utmost importance, in particular the notion of a civilian taking direct part in hostilities. Furthermore there is no necessity to introduce or to elaborate any new specific rules regarding targeted killing. On the one hand, targeted killing during armed conflict is covered by already existing rules of international humanitarian law. On the other hand, easing down the regime by inventing new rules for targeted killing might not serve the role of law. This would merely exacerbate the discussion on what targeted killing is and what it is not. Disagreement among legal scholars and practitioners, as well as the famous decision of the Israeli Supreme Court in 2006 shows that no general answers can be given and every case of targeted killing should be assessed according to all particular circumstances in each different situation</span></h4><h4 id="HCrushesnegground2013makesthetopicbidirectionalandunpredictable2013causesresearchoverstretchforceshypergenericsdestroysclash" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Crushes neg ground – makes the topic bidirectional and unpredictable – causes research overstretch forces hyper generics destroys clash</span></h4><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HReasonstoPreferandVoter-1" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Reasons to Prefer and Voter</span></h4><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HNetBenefit7E231toourinterpisLimitsDisad:" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Net Benefit ~23 1 to our interp is Limits Disad:</span></h4><h4 id="H22Limits22operatesinseveralworldviews.It2019skeytorealworldeducationaloutcomesandahealthyprocessforqualityoflife.ThisevalsoshowsweHAVEre-joindedandnotignoredouropponents." class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>"Limits" operates in several worldviews.

At that time, there was almost daily coverage and commentary about the legality and consequence of War on Terror policies such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) drone signature strikes in Pakistan and Yemen, indefinite detention, and the 2011 Libya intervention. We thought the topic would make for a good season of debate because it was rather timely and there was a clear controversy that pitted libertarian and progressive advocates and pro-Congress constitutional scholars against mostly conservative pundits and pro-Executive constitutional scholars. On April 22, we submitted a proposal to the NDT-CEDA debate community contending that we should have a year-long debate about restricting presidential war powers in areas such as UAV signature strikes, Offensive Cyber Operations (OCOs), Indefinite Detention, and introduction of United States Armed Forces into hostilities (<span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.cedadebate.org/forum/index.php?action=dlattach;topic=4800.0;attach=1667).  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.cedadebate.org/forum/index.php?action=dlattach;topic=4800.0;attach=1667).%27" tppabs="http://www.cedadebate.org/forum/index.php?action=dlattach;topic=4800.0;attach=1667)."><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.cedadebate.org/forum/index.php?action=dlattach;topic=4800.0;attach=1667).</span></a></span> The controversy was selected by the community. When we wrote the paper, we argued that the topic would make for good debate because it was timely "but not too timely." Little could we have anticipated a number of events that occurred since April 22 that would make us somewhat regret this statement. First, on May 23, President Obama gave an important speech at the National Defense University in Washington, D.C. that publicly outlined a number of new guidelines for UAV strikes and repeated his call on Congress to begin closure of the Guantanamo Bay detention center (<span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-05-23/politics/39467399_1_war-and-peace-cold-war-civil-war).  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-05-23/politics/39467399_1_war-and-peace-cold-war-civil-war).%27" tppabs="http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-05-23/politics/39467399_1_war-and-peace-cold-war-civil-war)."><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-05-23/politics/39467399_1_war-and-peace-cold-war-civil-war).</span></a></span> While none of these procedures or calls fundamentally changed the Obama administration’s rationale or legal defense for these policies (<span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/DC-Decoder/2013/0524/Has-Obama-tightened-US...)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/DC-Decoder/2013/0524/Has-Obama-tightened-US...)%27" tppabs="http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/DC-Decoder/2013/0524/Has-Obama-tightened-US...)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/DC-Decoder/2013/0524/Has-Obama-tightened-US...)</span></a></span>, the speech certainly raised the profile of the debate over executive war powers considerably. Second, on June 14, The Guardian newspaper released information obtained from whistleblower Richard Snowden, a U.S. programmer for the National Security Agency (NSA), which revealed the existence of secret NSA programs that collected telephone metadata and internet surveillance programs such as PRISM (<span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data).  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data).%27" tppabs="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data)."><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data).</span></a></span> Third, on August 31, Obama announced that he would seek congressional approval for a military strike against Syria (<span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/01/world/middleeast/syria.html).  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/01/world/middleeast/syria.html).%27" tppabs="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/01/world/middleeast/syria.html)."><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/01/world/middleeast/syria.html).</span></a></span> Although the President made clear in his announcement that he believed he had the constitutional authority to strike without approval, for some commentators (<span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/319827-obama-breaks-from-precedent-on-syria/)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/319827-obama-breaks-from-precedent-on-syria/)%27" tppabs="http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/319827-obama-breaks-from-precedent-on-syria/)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/319827-obama-breaks-from-precedent-on-syria/)</span></a></span>, Obama’s announcement represented a complete reversal in presidential war making precedent, especially in light of the 2011 Libyan intervention. As the commentary and reaction to this announcement and the other recent events of the past four months continue to play out, we believe that these events will produce a robust and dynamic context for a year-long collegiate debate about presidential war powers and congressional oversight. While we are amazed that so much has happened in such a short time, we believe that the core of the controversy – should Congress or the Courts impose additional restrictions on presidential war powers—remains fundamentally the same. Beyond its obviously timeliness, we believed debating about presidential war powers was important because of the stakes involved in the controversy. Since the Korean War, scholars and pundits have grown increasingly alarmed by the growing scope and techniques of presidential war making. In 1973, in the wake of Vietnam, Congress passed the joint War Powers Resolution (WPR) to increase Congress’s role in foreign policy and war making by requiring executive consultation with Congress prior to the use of military force, reporting within 48 hours after the start of hostiles, and requiring the close of military operations after 60 days unless Congress has authorized the use of force. Although the WPR was a significant legislative feat, 30 years since its passage, presidents have frequently ignores the WPR requirements and the changing nature of conflict does not fit neatly into these regulations. After the terrorist attacks on 9-11, many experts worry that executive war powers have expanded far beyond healthy limits. Consequently, there is a fear that continued expansion of these powers will undermine the constitutional system of checks and balances that maintain the democratic foundation of this country and risk constant and unlimited military actions, particularly in what Stephen Griffin refers to as a "long war" period like the War on Terror (<span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674058286).  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674058286).%27" tppabs="http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674058286)."><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674058286).</span></a></span> In comparison, pro-presidential powers advocates contend that new restrictions undermine flexibility and timely decision-making necessary to effectively counter contemporary national security risks. Thus, a debate about presidential wars powers is important to investigate a number of issues that have serious consequences on the status of democratic checks and national security of the United States. Lastly, debating presidential war powers is important because we the people have an important role in affecting the use of presidential war powers. As many legal scholars contend, regardless of the status of legal structures to check the presidency, an important political restrain on presidential war powers is the presence of a well-informed and educated public. As Justice Potter Stewart explains, "the only effective restraint upon executive policy and power…may lie in an enlightened citizenry – in an informed and critical public opinion which alone can protect the values of a democratic government" (<span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0403_0713_ZC3.html).  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0403_0713_ZC3.html).%27" tppabs="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0403_0713_ZC3.html)."><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0403_0713_ZC3.html).</span></a></span> As a result, this is not simply an academic debate about institutions and powers that that do not affect us. As the numerous recent foreign policy scandals make clear, anyone who uses a cell-phone or the internet is potential affected by unchecked presidential war powers. Even if we agree that these powers are justified, it is important that today’s college students understand and appreciate the scope and consequences of presidential war powers, as these students’ opinions will stand as an important potential check on the presidency.&nbsp;</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HWarpowersEducationisimportantforreasonsthatareexternaltorace.But2Cwarpowersalsoteachesusabouttheboomerang.Domesticoppressionisfirstrehearsedabroad.ProvesthereisatopicversionoftheAff." class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>War powers Education is important for reasons that are external to race.

L. Rev. 249, Lexis</p><p>II. Targeted Killing Is a Distinct Type of State Action Requiring Distinct Rules<br/>A. Extrajudicial Killing<br/>Targeted killing does not have an agreed-upon definition under international law. n13 <br/>AND<br/>including self-defense cases in which the state addresses due process concerns.<br/>An extrajudicial killing is a "deliberated killing not authorized by a previous judgment pronounced <br/>AND<br/>war, and Human Rights Law ("HRL"), which applies more generally.<br/>B. Killings in Territories of Armed Conflict<br/>Military strikes are most common in the context of armed conflict, so the discussion begins there. Within a territory engaged in armed conflict, targeted killing is a more clear-cut proposition. The familiar legal framework of IHL applies in armed conflicts whether of an international character or not of an international character. n20 With some exceptions, n21 the Geneva Conventions apply only in international armed conflicts.<br/>Military commanders have greater latitude in zones of armed conflict than they have in peaceful areas. n22 Within zones of armed conflict, commanders can select lawful targets for attack. The OLC memo found that Al-Aulaqi’s distance from the battlefield did not preclude a U.S. attack targeting him. n23 In the context of a global war, n24 commanders have always possessed authority to act that extends beyond the front lines. n25 Targeted killing is no different.<br/>C. Targeted Killing vs. Assassination<br/>Targeted killing and assassination are similar but distinct operations that commentators often conflate. n26 <br/>AND<br/>legal if it is distinct from assassination under Executive Order 12,333.<br/>Although Executive Order 12,333 is just the latest in a series beginning with <br/>AND<br/>. Targeted killing is based strictly on security concerns; assassination is political.<br/>Another area of contention is whether the term "assassination" applies to killings committed <br/>AND<br/>permissible to use a surprise attack to kill a person in war. n39<br/>Notwithstanding any of the above, the President can revoke or modify Executive Order 12<br/>AND<br/>order to carve out an exception for whatever activities he wished to conduct.<br/>D. Targeting Killing vs. Execution<br/>The first image to come to mind when picturing the U.S government killing a U.S. citizen is that of an execution. Targeted killing and execution are distinct from one another, but legal scholars often compare and conflate the two. n43 It is therefore worthwhile at the outset to distinguish targeted killing from execution.<br/>Execution is a judicial, postconviction sentence reserved for a narrow subset of the most serious offenders within a narrow subset of all possible crimes. State law, as opposed to international law, governs execution. n44 Execution provides years of appellate process and judicial review. If targeted killing is execution, all feasible judicial review is woefully inadequate. To survive as a practice, therefore, targeted killing must be distinguished from execution.<br/>Execution differs from targeted killing in terms of the person the government targets. States <br/>AND<br/>the protections inherent to a judicial process, while targeted killings are extrajudicial.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HTandExtra-Tarevoters2013de-justifiesthetopicandlinkstostasisandlimitsargs.-1" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>T and Extra-T are voters – de-justifies the topic and links to stasis and limits args.</span></h4><h4 id="HOurterminalimpactisFrameworkshouldn2019toutweighTinthisinstanceforthereasonsalready-cited." class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Our terminal impact is Framework shouldn’t outweigh T in this instance for the reasons already-cited.</span></h4><h2 id="H5" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>5</span></h2><h4 id="HRestrictingtargetedkillingcausesashifttolargescalegroundoperationswhichincreasesciviliancasualties" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Restricting targeted killing causes a shift to large scale ground operations which increases civilian casualties</span></h4><p>MARK <strong>BOWDEN</strong> 8/14/<strong>13</strong> (national correspondent for The Atlantic, graduate of Loyola University Maryland, where he also taught from 2001-2010.

Congress let a package of 55 breaks expire at the end of 2013, and Wyden has said renewing them is at the top of his list.<br/>While industries are eager to see breaks extended, it’s not looking like a quick process.<br/>Henrietta Treyz of Height Securities writes in a note Thursday that House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp will move forward with a "completely different approach to the extenders bill" that will delay passage of any bill through Congress until after the Nov. 4 mid-terms. &nbsp;Michigan Republican Camp is seeking a broad tax-code overhaul that would permanently provide for an extension of certain tax credits, she writes.<br/>Treyz writes it’s her firm’s understanding that Wyden and Sen. Orrin Hatch, the top Republican on the finance panel, agreed in principle on an initial draft of a bill that would extend the various breaks for two years.<br/>Chris Krueger of Guggenheim Securities said in a note earlier this week that the differing proposals "will likely amount to the tax equivalent of shadow boxing between the House and Senate, with little actual motion until after the elections". He adds: "Once the election is over, we continue to believe that all the provisions will be given a retroactive extension."<br/>Meanwhile, Democratic aides reportedly say Wyden plans to ask the committee to vote separately on some of the more controversial provisions, including one promoting development at NASCAR racetracks. But Democratic aides told the Washington Post they expect the entire list of extenders to emerge intact from the committee and add 2450 billion to this year’s budget deficit.<br/>Others, meanwhile, are more optimistic about timing.

Since the last major reform in 1986, the tax code has become a thicket of special interest breaks and illogical carve-outs that reflect political power rather than sound public policy. And while there is certainly not agreement on exactly how to reform the tax code, we’ve seen the conversation about reform move forward.<br/>Last year, then-Senate Finance Committee Chair Max Baucus, D-Mont<br/>AND<br/>go before enacting tax reform, but at least we’ve seen a start.<br/>So it was dismaying to hear that both the Senate and the House would be taking up tax extender legislation in the coming weeks.

The first involves the <br/>AND<br/>than their analog counterparts and can be upgraded more easily through improved software.<br/>Second, wind turbines can affect DoD’s test and training missions. When DoD tests <br/>AND<br/>radars used to train pilots are degraded by wind turbine clutter and shadowing.<br/>Although scientists have a reasonably good understanding of the technical problem, more research is <br/>AND<br/>fidelity and are inherently subjective; at best, they are blunt instruments.<br/>Concerns with the Siting Review Process<br/>DoD relies primarily on the FAA’s Obstacle Evaluation/Airport Airspace Analysis (OE/<br/>AND<br/>backing, it can create serious financial and execution challenges for the developer.<br/>To help avoid this problem, DoD has posted a red-yellow-green <br/>AND<br/>base and mistakenly interpreted that to be an Air Force-wide position.<br/>Even when DoD learns of a project only after it has been filed with the FAA, we work with the developer to alleviate conflicts. To date, these efforts have been largely successful. Absent the kind of changes discussed below, however, the number of projects raising DoD concerns will likely increase, as developers take advantage of time-limited grants and tax subsidies and as the number of turbines in specific areas reaches a threshold impact.<br/>In addition to the timing problem, the Department may have another concern with the <br/>AND<br/>ensure that the OE/AAA process adequately covers all of our missions.<br/>Finally, it is worth noting that the siting review process is most conducive to <br/>AND<br/>, DoD gets what amounts to an early notification of the proposed project.<br/>By comparison, early identification and resolution of conflicts is more difficult when the project <br/>AND<br/>did not learn of the project until the developer filed with the FAA.)<br/>Fixing the Problem<br/>The problems described above are serious but solvable. Along with other federal agencies, the Defense Department needs to move out on several parallel tracks. Let me first describe what is needed, conceptually. Then I will summarize some of the concrete steps that DoD and other federal agencies are taking.<br/>First and most immediately, the federal government needs to improve the process for reviewing <br/>AND<br/>nor does the wind energy community want us to take on that role.<br/>Second, the key federal agencies, including DoD, need to realign their research <br/>AND<br/>to estimate the impact of proposed structures as well as mitigation technology itself.<br/>Third, federal agencies should look at the current plan for upgrading the older surveillance radar. At least two question merit analysis. One, is the current schedule for upgrading the radar sufficiently aggressive (e.g., the Service Life Extension Program, or SLEP, for the Fossil, Oregon, long-range radar is scheduled for 2014)? Two, will the technology slated for insertion as part of the SLEP do an adequate job of mitigating wind turbine interference?<br/>DoD and other federal agencies are taking a number of concrete steps along these lines<br/>AND<br/>both short-term and longer-term changes to the review structure.<br/>Second, within the Department, I am working with the Deputy Under Secretary of <br/>AND<br/>approve easy cases quickly and apply increasingly sophisticated tools to the harder ones.<br/>We are currently defining the organizational and management requirements to implement this clearinghouse. A <br/>AND<br/>in the broader context of our nation’s goal to expand renewable energy resources.<br/>Third, we plan to hold a multi-session "dialogue" with outside <br/>AND<br/>review process. Our planned dialogue will formalize and expand this collaborative process.<br/>With respect to research and development, we are pursuing multiple initiatives as well. <br/>AND<br/>the impact of a proposed wind farm on a specific type of radar.<br/>Second, DHS will soon award a contract to develop an iterative, three-dimensional model to characterize the impact of wind turbines on long-range radars. The model’s specifications were developed by a wide range of stakeholders, including DoD, the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, the FAA and AWEA.<br/>Finally, the Department is taking steps to make the turbine-radar issue a research priority. For example, NORAD/NORTHCOM has included its surveillance mission on its Integrated Priority List, which provides guidance for how the Services should allocate their RandD resources. This is a necessary step in getting the Air Force Research Laboratory and other DoD RandD offices to see the turbine-radar issue as mission-relevant.<br/>Conclusion<br/>To maintain military readiness and homeland defense, the Department must protect its irreplaceable test <br/>AND<br/>.

It is also the preeminent example of United States-Canadian defense cooperation. But NORAD’s dominance also has meant that the greatest focus of our common efforts to protect North America has been in the domains of air and space.<br/>This aerospace focus is entirely reasonable. NORAD was established in response to a new <br/>AND<br/>integrated and bi-national system that permitted immediate action by both countries.<br/>Lessons of 9/11: Need to Expand Focus Beyond Aerospace to all Domains<br/>Among the lessons of September 11 were not only a reminder that North America is <br/>AND<br/>Community: "Our security and prosperity are mutually dependent and complementary."14<br/>As well, September 11 taught us that new threats could present themselves very quickly<br/>AND<br/>, a scientist formerly in the Canadian Department of National Defence pointed out:<br/>…reducing the vulnerability of our likely targets, handling casualties, contamination, and contagious diseases, and repairing damage, call for a wide variety of skills and equipment. …The responsibilities must be primarily national, although arrangements should be made for rapid aid in either direction across the US/Canadian border.15<br/>Possible maritime threats include the use of sea-launched cruise missiles or unmanned aerial <br/>AND<br/>3,000 ships off North America’s east and west coasts.18 5<br/>There is a lot to be done in the area of maritime security. In Canada, for example, the Chief of the Maritime Staff told the Standing Senate Committee on National Security and Defence:<br/>...we are putting together these maritime security operation centres on the East Coast and <br/>AND<br/>years after then we will have a fully operational, seamless organization."19<br/>The initial United States response to this post September 11 situation was to create the U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). In both cases, the idea was to rationalize a large number of separate programs and responsibilities, some of which focus primarily and some tangentially on the security of the United States.<br/>The commander of NORTHCOM has a Presidential mandate to direct, plan and conduct defense (including land, sea and air forces) and support to civil authorities within the United States. He is a ’unified’ commander. The United States had not had a unified command for such purposes before. The commander of NORTHCOM also assumed the continental defense planning responsibilities formerly exercised by the U.S. Joint Forces Command.<br/>It was clear that there had to be a close relationship between NORAD and NORTHCOM <br/>AND<br/>NORTHCOM is a unified United States command and its commander also commands NORAD.<br/>Canada also reexamined its security and defense practices, and, in December 2003, <br/>AND<br/>a crisis – being it a natural disaster or a terrorist attack."21<br/>In short, Canada is adopting a unified command structure similar to that of the United States and which will extend to regional commands. This is an important development, and it has the potential to increase and strengthen the effectiveness and readiness of the Canadian Forces if the funds for this plan are actually provided.<br/>A New North American Defense System?<br/>Thus, it appears that Canada and the United States have evolved new and parallel unified systems for dealing with the new military and security threats to North America. This parallel approach has the potential to facilitate and broaden United States-Canadian cooperation. The need to renew or renegotiate the NORAD Agreement offers a convenient moment for doing so.<br/>The goal of these negotiations ought to be a seamless and coherent all domain United States-Canadian continental defense strategy as identified by the Bi-National Planning Group. This approach is needed because such an arrangement can best maximize United States–Canadian defense cooperation and, for the US, strengthen its security at home. The Bi-National Planning Group observed in its Interim Report that:<br/>~t~here is an opportunity to make bold and meaningful strides towards streamlining <br/>AND<br/>a coherent military strategy that will seal our common seams and gaps.22</p><h3 id="HPtckeytowind" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Ptc key to wind</span></h3><h4 id="HDoesn2019tassumePTCextension2013thatmakeswindsustainableintheshortterm2013that2019sGoldberg" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Doesn’t assume PTC extension – that makes wind sustainable in the short term – that’s Goldberg</span></h4><p><strong>Green</strong> 8/1/<strong>12</strong> Nathanael Green director of renewable Energy Policy for New York City "Keep the U.S. wind industry strong by supporting the PTC tomorrow" <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/ngreene/keep_the_us_wind_industry_stro.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/ngreene/keep_the_us_wind_industry_stro.html%27" tppabs="http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/ngreene/keep_the_us_wind_industry_stro.html"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/ngreene/keep_the_us_wind_industry_stro.html</span></a></span></p><p>Over the past decade years, the United States has led the world in wind <br/>AND<br/>17,000 new wind-energy jobs in the next four years.&nbsp;</p><h4 id="HDoesn2019tassumeourspecificimpacts2013taxbreakscauseoffshorewindtocomeonline" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Doesn’t assume our specific impacts – tax breaks cause offshore wind to come online</span></h4><p><strong>OWW, 12 &nbsp;(Offshore Wind Works, Clean Energy States Alliance, 9/13,&nbsp;</strong><span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://offshorewindworks.tumblr.com/post/31471987996/new-momentum-brings-atlantic-offshore-wind-to-turning**)**  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://offshorewindworks.tumblr.com/post/31471987996/new-momentum-brings-atlantic-offshore-wind-to-turning**)**%27" tppabs="http://offshorewindworks.tumblr.com/post/31471987996/new-momentum-brings-atlantic-offshore-wind-to-turning**)**"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://offshorewindworks.tumblr.com/post/31471987996/new-momentum-brings-atlantic-offshore-wind-to-turning**)**</span></a></span></p><p>New momentum brings Atlantic offshore wind to "turning point" The title of the <br/>AND<br/>these areas by the end of the year."

in motion to revive an array of expired tax breaks, but a deal likely won’t get done until after the November mid-term elections, analysts say.<br/>Next week, new Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden is planning to unveil a proposal to temporarily extend breaks, including those for research and development and a state sales-tax deduction. Congress let a package of 55 breaks expire at the end of 2013, and Wyden has said renewing them is at the top of his list.<br/>While industries are eager to see breaks extended, it’s not looking like a quick process.<br/>Henrietta Treyz of Height Securities writes in a note Thursday that House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp will move forward with a "completely different approach to the extenders bill" that will delay passage of any bill through Congress until after the Nov. 4 mid-terms. &nbsp;Michigan Republican Camp is seeking a broad tax-code overhaul that would permanently provide for an extension of certain tax credits, she writes.<br/>Treyz writes it’s her firm’s understanding that Wyden and Sen. Orrin Hatch, the top Republican on the finance panel, agreed in principle on an initial draft of a bill that would extend the various breaks for two years.<br/>Chris Krueger of Guggenheim Securities said in a note earlier this week that the differing proposals "will likely amount to the tax equivalent of shadow boxing between the House and Senate, with little actual motion until after the elections". He adds: "Once the election is over, we continue to believe that all the provisions will be given a retroactive extension."<br/>Meanwhile, Democratic aides reportedly say Wyden plans to ask the committee to vote separately on some of the more controversial provisions, including one promoting development at NASCAR racetracks. But Democratic aides told the Washington Post they expect the entire list of extenders to emerge intact from the committee and add 2450 billion to this year’s budget deficit.<br/>Others, meanwhile, are more optimistic about timing. "The House Republicans are <br/>AND<br/>election, but which provisions to extend still need to be decided on.</p><p>Fiat makes the plan a "must pass" measure—-that causes unrelated riders to be attached<br/>Copeland, 8 (Curtis W.

Since the last major reform in 1986, the tax code has become a thicket of special interest breaks and illogical carve-outs that reflect political power rather than sound public policy. And while there is certainly not agreement on exactly how to reform the tax code, we’ve seen the conversation about reform move forward.<br/>Last year, then-Senate Finance Committee Chair Max Baucus, D-Mont<br/>AND<br/>go before enacting tax reform, but at least we’ve seen a start.<br/>So it was dismaying to hear that both the Senate and the House would be taking up tax extender legislation in the coming weeks. Tax extenders are those perennial "temporary" tax cuts that get passed year after year, usually by hitching a ride to a must-pass piece of legislation. If history teaches us anything, tax extenders will be passed with little or no debate on each individual provision included in the package.</p><p>That sustains the wind industry<br/><strong>Goldberg 3-21</strong> – Keith Goldberg, Senior Reporter, Energy and Environment at Law360 , 3-21-2014 <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.law360.com/environmental/articles/520749/lawmakers-push-wyden-boehner-to-save-green-tax-credits  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.law360.com/environmental/articles/520749/lawmakers-push-wyden-boehner-to-save-green-tax-credits%27" tppabs="http://www.law360.com/environmental/articles/520749/lawmakers-push-wyden-boehner-to-save-green-tax-credits"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.law360.com/environmental/articles/520749/lawmakers-push-wyden-boehner-to-save-green-tax-credits</span></a></span></p><p>&nbsp;A bipartisan group of 144 U.S. lawmakers, many from wind <br/>AND<br/>isn’t competitive enough with other types of energy yet to flourish without it.</p><p>Turbines disrupt military training and radar—-crushes NORTHCOM<br/><strong>Robyn 10</strong> – Dorthy Robyn, Guest Scholar at the Brookings Institution, Professor of Public Policy at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, and Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Installations and Environment, U.S. Department of Defense, "House Armed Services Subcommittee on The Readiness Hearing", Congressional Documents and Publications, 6-29, Lexis</p><p>The Technical Problem<br/>Wind turbines can interfere with the effectiveness of radar and other electromagnetic systems that are <br/>AND<br/>it difficult or impossible for the radar operator to see an actual target.<br/>For DoD, the problem arises in two different contexts. The first involves the <br/>AND<br/>than their analog counterparts and can be upgraded more easily through improved software.<br/>Second, wind turbines can affect DoD’s test and training missions. When DoD tests <br/>AND<br/>radars used to train pilots are degraded by wind turbine clutter and shadowing.<br/>Although scientists have a reasonably good understanding of the technical problem, more research is <br/>AND<br/>fidelity and are inherently subjective; at best, they are blunt instruments.<br/>Concerns with the Siting Review Process<br/>DoD relies primarily on the FAA’s Obstacle Evaluation/Airport Airspace Analysis (OE/<br/>AND<br/>backing, it can create serious financial and execution challenges for the developer.<br/>To help avoid this problem, DoD has posted a red-yellow-green <br/>AND<br/>base and mistakenly interpreted that to be an Air Force-wide position.<br/>Even when DoD learns of a project only after it has been filed with the FAA, we work with the developer to alleviate conflicts. To date, these efforts have been largely successful. Absent the kind of changes discussed below, however, the number of projects raising DoD concerns will likely increase, as developers take advantage of time-limited grants and tax subsidies and as the number of turbines in specific areas reaches a threshold impact.<br/>In addition to the timing problem, the Department may have another concern with the <br/>AND<br/>ensure that the OE/AAA process adequately covers all of our missions.<br/>Finally, it is worth noting that the siting review process is most conducive to <br/>AND<br/>, DoD gets what amounts to an early notification of the proposed project.<br/>By comparison, early identification and resolution of conflicts is more difficult when the project <br/>AND<br/>did not learn of the project until the developer filed with the FAA.)<br/>Fixing the Problem<br/>The problems described above are serious but solvable. Along with other federal agencies, the Defense Department needs to move out on several parallel tracks. Let me first describe what is needed, conceptually. Then I will summarize some of the concrete steps that DoD and other federal agencies are taking.<br/>First and most immediately, the federal government needs to improve the process for reviewing <br/>AND<br/>nor does the wind energy community want us to take on that role.<br/>Second, the key federal agencies, including DoD, need to realign their research <br/>AND<br/>to estimate the impact of proposed structures as well as mitigation technology itself.<br/>Third, federal agencies should look at the current plan for upgrading the older surveillance radar. At least two question merit analysis. One, is the current schedule for upgrading the radar sufficiently aggressive (e.g., the Service Life Extension Program, or SLEP, for the Fossil, Oregon, long-range radar is scheduled for 2014)? Two, will the technology slated for insertion as part of the SLEP do an adequate job of mitigating wind turbine interference?<br/>DoD and other federal agencies are taking a number of concrete steps along these lines<br/>AND<br/>both short-term and longer-term changes to the review structure.<br/>Second, within the Department, I am working with the Deputy Under Secretary of <br/>AND<br/>approve easy cases quickly and apply increasingly sophisticated tools to the harder ones.<br/>We are currently defining the organizational and management requirements to implement this clearinghouse. A <br/>AND<br/>in the broader context of our nation’s goal to expand renewable energy resources.<br/>Third, we plan to hold a multi-session "dialogue" with outside <br/>AND<br/>review process. Our planned dialogue will formalize and expand this collaborative process.<br/>With respect to research and development, we are pursuing multiple initiatives as well. <br/>AND<br/>the impact of a proposed wind farm on a specific type of radar.<br/>Second, DHS will soon award a contract to develop an iterative, three-dimensional model to characterize the impact of wind turbines on long-range radars. The model’s specifications were developed by a wide range of stakeholders, including DoD, the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, the FAA and AWEA.<br/>Finally, the Department is taking steps to make the turbine-radar issue a research priority. For example, NORAD/NORTHCOM has included its surveillance mission on its Integrated Priority List, which provides guidance for how the Services should allocate their RandD resources. This is a necessary step in getting the Air Force Research Laboratory and other DoD RandD offices to see the turbine-radar issue as mission-relevant.<br/>Conclusion<br/>To maintain military readiness and homeland defense, the Department must protect its irreplaceable test <br/>AND<br/>. We look forward to working with the Congress to implement these changes.</p><p>Global nuclear and bio war<br/><strong>Mason 5</strong> – Dwight N.

It is also the preeminent example of United States-Canadian defense cooperation. But NORAD’s dominance also has meant that the greatest focus of our common efforts to protect North America has been in the domains of air and space.<br/>This aerospace focus is entirely reasonable. NORAD was established in response to a new <br/>AND<br/>integrated and bi-national system that permitted immediate action by both countries.<br/>Lessons of 9/11: Need to Expand Focus Beyond Aerospace to all Domains<br/>Among the lessons of September 11 were not only a reminder that North America is <br/>AND<br/>Community: "Our security and prosperity are mutually dependent and complementary."14<br/>As well, September 11 taught us that new threats could present themselves very quickly<br/>AND<br/>, a scientist formerly in the Canadian Department of National Defence pointed out:<br/>…reducing the vulnerability of our likely targets, handling casualties, contamination, and contagious diseases, and repairing damage, call for a wide variety of skills and equipment. …The responsibilities must be primarily national, although arrangements should be made for rapid aid in either direction across the US/Canadian border.15<br/>Possible maritime threats include the use of sea-launched cruise missiles or unmanned aerial <br/>AND<br/>3,000 ships off North America’s east and west coasts.18 5<br/>There is a lot to be done in the area of maritime security. In Canada, for example, the Chief of the Maritime Staff told the Standing Senate Committee on National Security and Defence:<br/>...we are putting together these maritime security operation centres on the East Coast and <br/>AND<br/>years after then we will have a fully operational, seamless organization."19<br/>The initial United States response to this post September 11 situation was to create the U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). In both cases, the idea was to rationalize a large number of separate programs and responsibilities, some of which focus primarily and some tangentially on the security of the United States.<br/>The commander of NORTHCOM has a Presidential mandate to direct, plan and conduct defense (including land, sea and air forces) and support to civil authorities within the United States. He is a ’unified’ commander. The United States had not had a unified command for such purposes before. The commander of NORTHCOM also assumed the continental defense planning responsibilities formerly exercised by the U.S. Joint Forces Command.<br/>It was clear that there had to be a close relationship between NORAD and NORTHCOM <br/>AND<br/>NORTHCOM is a unified United States command and its commander also commands NORAD.<br/>Canada also reexamined its security and defense practices, and, in December 2003, <br/>AND<br/>a crisis – being it a natural disaster or a terrorist attack."21<br/>In short, Canada is adopting a unified command structure similar to that of the United States and which will extend to regional commands. This is an important development, and it has the potential to increase and strengthen the effectiveness and readiness of the Canadian Forces if the funds for this plan are actually provided.<br/>A New North American Defense System?<br/>Thus, it appears that Canada and the United States have evolved new and parallel unified systems for dealing with the new military and security threats to North America. This parallel approach has the potential to facilitate and broaden United States-Canadian cooperation. The need to renew or renegotiate the NORAD Agreement offers a convenient moment for doing so.<br/>The goal of these negotiations ought to be a seamless and coherent all domain United States-Canadian continental defense strategy as identified by the Bi-National Planning Group. This approach is needed because such an arrangement can best maximize United States–Canadian defense cooperation and, for the US, strengthen its security at home. The Bi-National Planning Group observed in its Interim Report that:<br/>~t~here is an opportunity to make bold and meaningful strides towards streamlining <br/>AND<br/>a coherent military strategy that will seal our common seams and gaps.22</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h2 id="HSolvency-2" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Solvency</span></h2><h3 id="H1nc2013solvency" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>1nc – solvency</span></h3><h4 id="HUSrejectstheplan2013don2019ttrustPakistaniintelligence" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>US rejects the plan – don’t trust Pakistani intelligence</span></h4><p>Husain <strong>Haqqani</strong> and MARK LANDLER <strong>10/22</strong>/13 (Q and A between mark landler, new York times staff writer, and husain haqqani, former Pakistani ambassador to the US, "Ex-Envoy Says Misunderstanding Runs on Both Sides of U.S.-Pakistan Ties" <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/23/world/asia/ex-envoy-says-misunderstanding-runs-on-both-sides-of-us-pakistan-ties.html?_r=126)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/23/world/asia/ex-envoy-says-misunderstanding-runs-on-both-sides-of-us-pakistan-ties.html?_r=126)%27" tppabs="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/23/world/asia/ex-envoy-says-misunderstanding-runs-on-both-sides-of-us-pakistan-ties.html?_r=126)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/23/world/asia/ex-envoy-says-misunderstanding-runs-on-both-sides-of-us-pakistan-ties.html?_r=126)</span></a></span></p><p>Q.
