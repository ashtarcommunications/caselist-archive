And now in Libya, we have reached the point that even resolutions are no longer needed.<br/>It is said that there is no precedent for fighting al Qaeda, for example, because it is not a nation but a subnational group. Therefore, Bush could not reasonably have been expected to ask for a declaration of war. But there is precedent: Thomas Jefferson asked for and received a declaration of war against the Barbary pirates. This authorized Jefferson to wage war against a subnational group of pirates as if they were a nation.<br/>Had Bush requested a declaration of war on al Qaeda on Sept. 12, <br/>AND<br/>they were or to move to block them wherever the president saw fit.<br/>Leaving aside the military wisdom of Afghanistan or Iraq, the legal and moral foundations <br/>AND<br/>.

I won’t make the argument on that here, but simply assert it. What is most important is that the republic not be overwhelmed in the course of pursuing imperial goals. The declaration of war is precisely the point at which imperial interests can overwhelm republican prerogatives.<br/>There are enormous complexities here. Nuclear war has not been abolished.

Meigs’s subsequent ~*985~ report recommended that an aqueduct be built just above Great Falls, north of Washington. Congress approved that recommendation, and the Department of War began work on the aqueduct, led by Meigs himself. For several years, things ran very smoothly. In the Buchanan Administration, however, Meigs’s relationship with Secretary of War John Floyd turned sour: Floyd dismissed Meigs and made sure the Administration’s proposed budget included no funds for work on the aqueduct. Meigs subject to legislatively imposed restrictions. As we have seen, Presidents have long operated on just that assumption, and they have adjusted their actions accordingly - and in ways that cannot be said to have clearly imperiled the nation. Thus the history undermines assertions about the inherent or inevitable unmanageability or dangers of recognizing legislative control over the conduct of war. In other words, this history offers us valuable information about how things have worked in the past, and thereby helps to inform us about what consequences might follow from a constitutional judgment in the here and now.<br/>Moreover, this historical account performs at least one function beyond supplying information relevant to <br/>AND<br/>for a change that risks such a fundamental revision of our national identity.</p><h4 id="HU.S.warpowerssetprecedentsmodeledinternationally2014-precedentofexecutiveauthorityencouragespreemptiveconflictinKorea" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>U.S. war powers set precedents modeled internationally —- precedent of executive authority encourages preemptive conflict in Korea</span></h4><p><strong>Sloane 8</strong> – Sloane, Associate Professor of Law, Boston University School of Law, 2008 (Robert, Boston University Law Review, April, 88 B.U.L.

As John Locke tells us:<br/>It may be too great a temptation to human frailty apt to grasp at power <br/>AND<br/>rest of the community, contrary to the ends of society and government.<br/>Madison, Hamilton, and Locke sum up the fears expressed by many over the exercises of power by President Bush in the war on terror. As one prominent critic put it, President Bush is trying to "eliminate nearly all the checks and balances that have been traditionally understood to limit the power of the president."18<br/>The power to declare war, when properly understood, provides Congress with a powerful <br/>AND<br/>over appropriations ensures that Congress can always end a conflict it deems unwise.<br/>Rather, a declaration of war is about acknowledging the severity of a threat to <br/>AND<br/>and the president did not need expanded domestic powers to prosecute the wars.<br/>By contrast, while the war on terror does have components that look like traditional <br/>AND<br/>branch of American government. The power to declare war provides that check.<br/>Understanding the declare war clause along these lines clearly separates potential armed conflicts into distinct <br/>AND<br/>used and what powers can be called upon to support the military effort.<br/>In a perfect war:<br/>One whole nation is at war with another whole nation; and all the members of the nation declaring war are authorized to commit hostilities against all the members of the other, in every place, and under every circumstance. In such a war all the members act under a general authority, and all the rights and consequences of war attach to their condition.20<br/>In a perfect war, the entire energy of the nation is directed towards the effort, while an imperfect war is fought in a more ~End Page 6~ limited manner. Justice Chase’s concurrence in Bas explains the limitations that result from a war being imperfect:<br/>Congress has not declared war in general terms, but Congress has authorized hostilities on <br/>AND<br/>only to citizens appointed by commissions or exposed to immediate outrage and violence.<br/>A war of the formally declared, or perfect, type involves a level and <br/>AND<br/>for food and materiel, or even intern large numbers of American citizens.<br/>When the country is not in a state of perfect war by virtue of a <br/>AND<br/>power to take over the mills and force them to produce steel.21<br/>Despite Truman’s claim of inherent authority and military necessity, the seizure of the mills was struck down as it was, according to Justice Black’s opinion, "lawmaking, a legislative function which the Constitution has expressly confided to the Congress and not to the President. … In the framework of our Constitution, the President’s power to see that the laws are faithfully executed refutes the idea that he is to be a lawmaker."22 Furthermore:<br/>The order cannot properly be sustained as an exercise of the President’s military power as <br/>AND<br/>a job for the Nation’s lawmakers, not for its military authorities.23<br/>When the president wants to take, pursuant to his powers as commander-in<br/>AND<br/>terrorist organizations, or change the rules governing the procedures for military commissions.<br/>In wartime, however, it may be neither expedient nor strategically sound for the <br/>AND<br/>Congress time and time again to enact laws to advance the war effort.<br/>The declarations of war for World Wars I and II both contain specific, particular<br/>AND<br/>than when using force in a less comprehensive manner during a limited conflict.<br/>"All the resources of the government" and "all of the resources of <br/>AND<br/>congressional legislation, there are still certain constitutional guarantees that cannot be ignored.<br/>In the narrow interpretation advanced by the Bush administration, the trigger for the president’s <br/>AND<br/>in the balance of powers between the president and Congress in wartime."27<br/>This argument is unsatisfying on two grounds. First, it cannot be said that <br/>AND<br/>1989 Panama War, or of Yugoslavs during the Kosovo conflict. …"29<br/>The second reason that this argument does not work is in the language of the <br/>AND<br/>war powers and places the president at the height of his war powers.<br/>But the language of the AUMFs does not support such an argument. Where the <br/>AND<br/>times of crisis, Congress still can and must play an important role.<br/>As President Ford admonished, a theory of war powers must be capable of functioning <br/>AND<br/>-so to undo that separation, even in the face of war.</p><h3 id="HPlan2013" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Plan –</span></h3><h4 id="HTheUnitedStatesFederalGovernmentshouldrequireCongressionalauthorizationpriortoinitiatingoffensiveuseofmilitaryforce." class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>The United States Federal Government should require Congressional authorization prior to initiating offensive use of military force.</span></h4><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HHistorystronglysuggestsObamacompliance" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>History strongly suggests Obama compliance</span></h4><p><strong>Barron 8</strong> – David J.

Meigs’s subsequent ~*985~ report recommended that an aqueduct be built just above Great Falls, north of Washington. Congress approved that recommendation, and the Department of War began work on the aqueduct, led by Meigs himself. For several years, things ran very smoothly. In the Buchanan Administration, however, Meigs’s relationship with Secretary of War John Floyd turned sour: Floyd dismissed Meigs and made sure the Administration’s proposed budget included no funds for work on the aqueduct. Meigs subject to legislatively imposed restrictions. As we have seen, Presidents have long operated on just that assumption, and they have adjusted their actions accordingly - and in ways that cannot be said to have clearly imperiled the nation. Thus the history undermines assertions about the inherent or inevitable unmanageability or dangers of recognizing legislative control over the conduct of war.

As John Locke tells us:<br/>It may be too great a temptation to human frailty apt to grasp at power <br/>AND<br/>rest of the community, contrary to the ends of society and government.<br/>Madison, Hamilton, and Locke sum up the fears expressed by many over the exercises of power by President Bush in the war on terror. As one prominent critic put it, President Bush is trying to "eliminate nearly all the checks and balances that have been traditionally understood to limit the power of the president."18<br/>The power to declare war, when properly understood, provides Congress with a powerful <br/>AND<br/>over appropriations ensures that Congress can always end a conflict it deems unwise.<br/>Rather, a declaration of war is about acknowledging the severity of a threat to <br/>AND<br/>and the president did not need expanded domestic powers to prosecute the wars.<br/>By contrast, while the war on terror does have components that look like traditional <br/>AND<br/>branch of American government. The power to declare war provides that check.<br/>Understanding the declare war clause along these lines clearly separates potential armed conflicts into distinct <br/>AND<br/>used and what powers can be called upon to support the military effort.<br/>In a perfect war:<br/>One whole nation is at war with another whole nation; and all the members of the nation declaring war are authorized to commit hostilities against all the members of the other, in every place, and under every circumstance. In such a war all the members act under a general authority, and all the rights and consequences of war attach to their condition.20<br/>In a perfect war, the entire energy of the nation is directed towards the effort, while an imperfect war is fought in a more ~End Page 6~ limited manner. Justice Chase’s concurrence in Bas explains the limitations that result from a war being imperfect:<br/>Congress has not declared war in general terms, but Congress has authorized hostilities on <br/>AND<br/>only to citizens appointed by commissions or exposed to immediate outrage and violence.<br/>A war of the formally declared, or perfect, type involves a level and <br/>AND<br/>for food and materiel, or even intern large numbers of American citizens.<br/>When the country is not in a state of perfect war by virtue of a <br/>AND<br/>power to take over the mills and force them to produce steel.21<br/>Despite Truman’s claim of inherent authority and military necessity, the seizure of the mills was struck down as it was, according to Justice Black’s opinion, "lawmaking, a legislative function which the Constitution has expressly confided to the Congress and not to the President. … In the framework of our Constitution, the President’s power to see that the laws are faithfully executed refutes the idea that he is to be a lawmaker."22 Furthermore:<br/>The order cannot properly be sustained as an exercise of the President’s military power as <br/>AND<br/>a job for the Nation’s lawmakers, not for its military authorities.23<br/>When the president wants to take, pursuant to his powers as commander-in<br/>AND<br/>terrorist organizations, or change the rules governing the procedures for military commissions.<br/>In wartime, however, it may be neither expedient nor strategically sound for the <br/>AND<br/>Congress time and time again to enact laws to advance the war effort.<br/>The declarations of war for World Wars I and II both contain specific, particular<br/>AND<br/>than when using force in a less comprehensive manner during a limited conflict.<br/>"All the resources of the government" and "all of the resources of <br/>AND<br/>congressional legislation, there are still certain constitutional guarantees that cannot be ignored.<br/>In the narrow interpretation advanced by the Bush administration, the trigger for the president’s <br/>AND<br/>in the balance of powers between the president and Congress in wartime."27<br/>This argument is unsatisfying on two grounds. First, it cannot be said that <br/>AND<br/>1989 Panama War, or of Yugoslavs during the Kosovo conflict. …"29<br/>The second reason that this argument does not work is in the language of the <br/>AND<br/>war powers and places the president at the height of his war powers.<br/>But the language of the AUMFs does not support such an argument. Where the <br/>AND<br/>times of crisis, Congress still can and must play an important role.<br/>As President Ford admonished, a theory of war powers must be capable of functioning <br/>AND<br/>-so to undo that separation, even in the face of war.</p><h3 id="HPlan2013-1" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Plan –</span></h3><h4 id="HTheUnitedStatesFederalGovernmentshouldrequireCongressionalauthorizationpriortoinitiatingoffensiveuseofmilitaryforce.-1" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>The United States Federal Government should require Congressional authorization prior to initiating offensive use of military force.</span></h4><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HHistorystronglysuggestsObamacompliance-1" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>History strongly suggests Obama compliance</span></h4><p><strong>Barron 8</strong> – David J.

Decrying the so-called "surge" or curbing the president’s authority to conduct ongoing operations will contribute little to that end. Legislative action to foreswear preventive war might contribute quite a lot.<br/>Long viewed as immoral, illicit, and imprudent, preventive war — attacking to <br/>AND<br/>to "impose preemptive, unilateral military force when and where it chooses."<br/>Although the Constitution endows the legislative branch with the sole authority to declare war, the president did not consult Congress before announcing his new policy. He promulgated the Bush Doctrine by fiat. Then he acted on it.<br/>In 2003, Saddam Hussein posed no immediate threat to the United States; arguing that he might one day do so, the administration depicted the invasion of Iraq as an act of anticipatory self-defense. To their everlasting shame, a majority of members in both the House and the Senate went along, passing a resolution that "authorized" the president to do what he was clearly intent on doing anyway. Implicitly, the Bush Doctrine received congressional endorsement.<br/>Events since have affirmed the wisdom of seeing preventive war as immoral, illicit, <br/>AND<br/>would silence critics who condemned the war as morally unjustified and patently illegal.<br/>None of these expectations has come to pass. In its trial run, the Bush Doctrine has been found wanting.<br/>Today, Iraq teeters on the brink of disintegration. The war’s costs, already staggering, continue to mount. Violence triggered by the US invasion has killed thousands of Iraqi civilians. We cannot fully absolve ourselves of responsibility for those deaths.<br/>Our folly has alienated friends and emboldened enemies. Rather than nipping in the bud an ostensibly emerging threat, the Iraq war has diverted attention from existing dangers (such as Al Qaeda) while encouraging potential adversaries (like Iran) to see us as weak.<br/>The remedy to this catastrophic failure lies not in having another go — a preventive attack against Iran, for example — but in acknowledging that the Bush Doctrine is inherently pernicious. Our reckless flirtation with preventive war qualifies as not only wrong, but also stupid. Indeed, the Bush Doctrine poses a greater danger to the United States than do the perils it supposedly guards against.<br/>We urgently need to abrogate that doctrine in favor of principles that reflect our true interests and our professed moral values. Here lies an opportunity for Congress to make a difference.<br/>The fifth anniversary of President Bush’s West Point speech approaches. Prior to that date<br/>AND<br/>of force will require prior Congressional authorization, as required by the Constitution.<br/>The legislation should state plainly our determination to defend ourselves and our allies. But it should indicate no less plainly that the United States no longer claims the prerogative of using "preemptive, unilateral military force when and where it chooses."<br/>Declaring the Bush Doctrine defunct will not solve the problems posed by Iraq, but it will reduce the likelihood that we will see more Iraqs in our future. By taking such action, Congress will restore its relevance, its badly tarnished honor, and its standing in the eyes of the American people.<br/>This spills over and builds institutional capacity for broader Congressional power —- active confrontation’s key<br/><strong>Schumer 7</strong> – Charles E.

But as true as that once was, this system of exquisite checks and balances is at risk of being made anachronistic by recent legal and political developments. The traditional functions of Congress as lawmaker and a check on other branches have come under sustained and systematic assault from both the judicial and executive branches.<br/>The assault from the Executive began as a gradual diminution of congressional power after a <br/>AND<br/>lawmaker and its role as a bulwark against overreaching by the other branches. <br/>Although the trends in the two other branches of American government have developed separately, <br/>AND<br/>. The costs of an anemic Congress over the long term are considerable.<br/>First, continued erosion of Congress’s lawmaking power undermines democracy. Preemption of the legislative function by the President increases the concentration of power and the risk of abuse.

Preemption of the legislative function by the Judiciary similarly diminishes democracy.<br/>Second, in the absence of a prompt reassertion of Congress’s power, its powerlessness <br/>AND<br/>, it may find that it lacks the institutional capacity to do so.<br/>In sum, Congress does have a role equal to the other branches and must have this equal role.

The great global project is no longer to stop communism, counter terrorists, or promote a superficial notion of freedom. Rather, the world must accommodate 3 billion additional middle-class aspirants in two short decades — without provoking resource wars, insurgencies, and the devastation of our planet’s ecosystem. For this we need a strategy.<br/>The status quo is untenable. In the United States, the country’s economic engine <br/>AND<br/>S. cities, the country is at the end of the road.<br/>Abroad, Washington’s post-Cold War pattern of episodic adventurism and incremental crisis management <br/>AND<br/>Taiwan — grow increasingly enmeshed in the power dynamics of this new era.<br/>Simply put, the current U.S. and international order is unsustainable, and myriad disruptions signal that it is now in a process of collapse. Until the United States implements a new grand strategy, the country will face even more rapid degradation of domestic and global conditions.<br/>This is not an over-the-horizon danger. The interplay of four strategic antagonists is causing Americans daily harm.<br/>Economic Inclusion<br/>The ranks of the world’s nouveaux riches are swelling. The planet is on track to welcome 3 billion new members of the global middle class in the next 20 years. For those fortunate enough to climb out of poverty, advancement translates into a 300 percent increase in income and resource consumption.<br/>That’s great for each individual, but as a whole, it will strain our <br/>AND<br/>to them, whether energy, water, food, or strategic minerals.<br/>Ecosystem Depletion<br/>Human activity has disrupted the equilibrium of the Earth’s planetary systems. We are emitting too much carbon, we are changing the chemistry of both freshwater and saltwater bodies, and we are overconsuming the natural capital we rely on to produce life-giving ecosystem services.<br/>We are straining our planet to the breaking point, risking abrupt changes to the <br/>AND<br/>mass human migration, and regional war as these critical systems degrade further.<br/>Contained Depression<br/>The United States is not experiencing a mere business-cycle downturn — this is a "contained depression." The 2008 financial crisis triggered a broad deleveraging (debt crisis) across households and businesses. Incomes failed to service record levels of consumer and corporate debt, further reducing employment and in turn reducing revenues to state and federal governments.<br/>While Federal Reserve policy, the TARP bailout, and the stimulus bill have contained <br/>AND<br/>, American households and businesses have only begun to address their deep indebtedness.<br/>Bernanke and his colleagues cannot generate the circumstances necessary to end the depression — reviving <br/>AND<br/>amount of political attention being paid to long-term entitlements is misplaced.<br/>Well before the country hits the entitlement wall, the economy is at great risk of deepening its austerity spiral as businesses shed employees to appear more profitable to shareholders. That will further reduce household incomes, decreasing demand and government revenue in turn. Meanwhile, extended American economic weakness will only exacerbate the global macroeconomic risk from the eurozone to China.<br/>Resilience Deficit<br/>The systems, supply chains, and infrastructure that connect our markets are fragile and <br/>AND<br/>result, prices for light bulbs, wind turbines, and batteries spiked.<br/>It’s not just supply chains.

It looks at the world, it looks at America, and it defines the broad path the country must take to advance its most sacred objectives.<br/>Throughout U.S. history, grand strategy has navigated between two unacceptable extremes: Empire America and Fortress America. Being an empire — governing other lands and peoples outside the U.S. Constitution — is an affront to America’s core principles of democracy and self-government. Isolationism, in turn, risks the certain rise of unacceptable threats to commerce, security, and basic American values.<br/>To meet the global challenges of World War II and the Cold War, U.S. leaders innovated in the design of grand strategy. As practiced by Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry Truman, and Dwight Eisenhower, grand strategy became the correlation of America’s economic engine, its foreign policy, and its governing institutions to meet the great global challenge of the era.<br/>In both World War II and the Cold War, the secret to America’s success <br/>AND<br/>best them in a longer-term contest of economic and political systems.<br/>And best them America did. To ensure the Soviets’ defeat, Truman and Eisenhower did not leave the economic contest to any invisible hand. Rather, they systematically oriented the U.S. economy to take advantage of the demand in the system: suburban housing, consumer goods, and reconstruction materials for Europe and Japan. By living the American Dream, Americans helped stop Soviet advances.<br/>By the time candidates John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon debated in 1960, Eisenhower’s grand strategy had fused with America’s cultural DNA — it was fully adopted and internalized by both political parties, corporate leadership, government bureaucracy, and the American people. Since the Soviet Union’s 1991 collapse, however, the United States has failed to identify, adopt, or implement a revised grand strategy.<br/>Instead, over the past 20 years, the United States’ default strategy has been to incrementally adjust national security and economic policies to defend and extend its Cold War economic engine. The result is the unsustainable U.S. and international order.<br/>A New Grand Strategic Concept<br/>In the face of the present danger and in the best tradition of the republic, America’s response must be to lead. The country must put its own house in order and, with willing partners, author a prosperous, secure, and sustainable future. The task is clear: The United States must lead the global transition to sustainability.<br/>While some great powers and world capitals have been warning of these dangers for some time, it is clear that the effort ultimately requires an upgrade to the current international system. This will require the kind of principled, consistent leadership and hard-nosed geopolitics that only America, at its best, is able to deliver.<br/>America must once again start at home. For a limited time, it will <br/>AND<br/>implement, and verify a durable transition framework among the world’s major economies.<br/>Throughout the transition, America will have to build and strengthen capable partners to provide basic security assurances. Political boundaries will only change through a transparent process of self-determination; global commons will remain open and secure; and sovereignty will be limited only by the responsibility to protect.<br/>This isn’t going to be easy. To achieve all this, Washington must redesign its institutions of governance, consistent with the U.S. Constitution, to ensure that government has the appropriate authorities and capabilities, and no more, to implement this strategy at home and abroad.</p><h4 id="HCongressionalwarpower2019skeytotreatypower" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Congressional war power’s key to treaty power</span></h4><p><strong>Healy 00</strong> – Gene Healy, Vice President at the Cato Institute and JD from University of Chicago Law School, "Arrogance of Power Reborn: The Imperial Presidency and Foreign Policy in the Clinton Years", Cato Policy Analysis No. 389, 12-13, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/arrogance-power-reborn-imperial-presidency-foreign-policy-clinton-years  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/arrogance-power-reborn-imperial-presidency-foreign-policy-clinton-years%27" tppabs="http://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/arrogance-power-reborn-imperial-presidency-foreign-policy-clinton-years"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/arrogance-power-reborn-imperial-presidency-foreign-policy-clinton-years</span></a></span></p><p>As William Jefferson Clinton came to power in January 1993, there was some reason to hope that the imperial presidency would be scaled back. Clinton, after all, was the first post-Cold War president and a member of a political party that had in the wake of the Vietnam War striven to restrain presidential aggrandizement in foreign policy.<br/>Such hopes proved illusory. Throughout his administration, President Clinton has adopted a view <br/>AND<br/>. Those actions demonstrate that President Clinton has routinely abused the treaty power.<br/>In addition to the abuse of the treaty power, the president has repeatedly usurped the congressional war power. In Haiti, Iraq, Sudan, and Bosnia, the Clinton administration displayed its contempt for the constitutional process and asserted a unilateral power to wage war without congressional approval. The most flagrant example was the 78-day air war conducted against Serbia in 1999 despite Congress’s adamant refusal to approve the action.<br/>As we approach the end of President Clinton’s second term, the imperial presidency is as unconstrained and as menacing as it has been at any time since the Vietnam War. Bold congressional action is needed to reclaim legislative authority over the war power and the treaty power. Only then will America have an executive branch that comports with republican principles of government and the original constitutional design.</p><h4 id="HExecutiveinterpretationunravelsthetreatysystem" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Executive interpretation unravels the treaty system</span></h4><p><strong>Weiss 11</strong> – Joshua Weiss, JD from George Washington University Law School, "Defining Executive Deference in Treaty Interpretation Cases", George Washington Law Review, 79(5), July, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://groups.law.gwu.edu/lr/ArticlePDF/79-5-Weiss.pdf  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://groups.law.gwu.edu/lr/ArticlePDF/79-5-Weiss.pdf%27" tppabs="http://groups.law.gwu.edu/lr/ArticlePDF/79-5-Weiss.pdf"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://groups.law.gwu.edu/lr/ArticlePDF/79-5-Weiss.pdf</span></a></span></p><p>B.

Most notably, total deference creates unchecked executive power because of the Executive’s almost exclusive role in drafting treaty text. As a result, total deference could lead to manipulation and bad faith interpretation of U.S. treaty obligations. These risks are disconcerting in their own right, but they carry additional importance because persistent bad-faith treaty conduct would undermine the legitimacy of U.S. treaties and produce retaliatory interpretations abroad.73<br/>The potential for self-dealing resulting from unfettered deference is particularly worrisome in the <br/>AND<br/>A suitable treaty interpretation framework must maintain a role for courts to play.</p><h4 id="HExtinction" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Extinction</span></h4><p><strong>Moss 10</strong> – Lawrence C.

Res. 53 is an excellent step in that direction. &nbsp;The first, crucial revision contained in the new statute is the language in Section 3 prohibiting the President from initiating warfare without clear authorization from Congress, unless he or she is acting to repel armed attacks on United States territories, troops or citizens.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Various administrations and commentators have argued that the situations in which the President requires <br/>AND<br/>respond to attacks on U.S. territories, troops or citizens.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One could, of course, hypothesize a myriad of situations where the nation <br/>AND<br/>any rationality, be turned into a justification for "launching sudden attacks."<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, as in 1787, the reality is that American national security can <br/>AND<br/>rumors, reports, intuitions, or even informed intelligence warnings of attacks.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, Congress has demonstrated that where United States national security is seriously threatened<br/>AND<br/>Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, or the 1993 World Trade Center bombing.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that many situations will be murky, complicated or divisive and therefore that quick congressional action will not be forthcoming. &nbsp;But in those cases, the United States should not use military force until a substantial consensus develops in Congress and the public that military force is necessary, appropriate and wise.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While there might be rare future emergencies not covered under the repel armed attack <br/>AND<br/>President Lincoln argued should be done when faced with such grave emergency crises.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this constitutional perspective, section 3 of the Constitutional War Powers Amendments of <br/>AND<br/>be subject to misinterpretation. &nbsp;As then congressman Abraham Lincoln argued in 1848,<br/>Allow the President to invade a neighboring nation, whenever he shall deem it necessary to repell an invasion . . . and you allow him to make war at pleasure. &nbsp;Study to see if you can fix any limit to his power in this respect.22</p><h4 id="HPlanovercomesbarrierstoenforcement" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Plan overcomes barriers to enforcement</span></h4><p><strong>Lobel 9</strong> – Jules Lobel, Professor of Law at the University of Pittsburgh.
