And now in Libya, we have reached the point that even resolutions are no longer needed.<br/>It is said that there is no precedent for fighting al Qaeda, for example, because it is not a nation but a subnational group. Therefore, Bush could not reasonably have been expected to ask for a declaration of war. But there is precedent: Thomas Jefferson asked for and received a declaration of war against the Barbary pirates. This authorized Jefferson to wage war against a subnational group of pirates as if they were a nation.<br/>Had Bush requested a declaration of war on al Qaeda on Sept. 12, <br/>AND<br/>they were or to move to block them wherever the president saw fit.<br/>Leaving aside the military wisdom of Afghanistan or Iraq, the legal and moral foundations <br/>AND<br/>.

I won't make the argument on that here, but simply assert it. What is most important is that the republic not be overwhelmed in the course of pursuing imperial goals.

In light of the abuses that have taken place under the Bush administration, it is the responsibility of a new administration to insist on transparency in the drafting of new legislation.<br/>There is a long history of attempts to revise the War Powers Resolution. As new legislation is drafted, though, it will be important to focus on the central constitutional issues. Much time has been spent in debating how to address contingencies. It will be impossible to write into law any comprehensive formula for every conceivable situation, though; much more important will be establishing the fundamental principles of reform:<br/>The War Powers Resolution should explicitly prohibit executive acts of war without previous Congressional authorization. The only exception should be the executive’s power in an emergency to use short-term force to repel sudden attacks on US territories, troops or citizens.<br/>It is true that many potential conflict situations will be murky, complicated or divisive, and that quick congressional action may not always be forthcoming. Yet, history shows the folly of launching wars that are not supported by the American people. The United States should not use military force until a substantial consensus develops in Congress and the public that military force is necessary, appropriate and wise.<br/>Today, as in 1787, the reality is that the interests of the people <br/>AND<br/>disguised as preemptive war, has no place in constitutional or international law.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h3 id="HChina1AC" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>China 1AC</span></h3><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HRestoringwarpowerstopsCongressionalmeddlingindiplomacy---it2019sgrowingovertheEastChinaSea" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Restoring war power stops Congressional meddling in diplomacy---it’s growing over the East China Sea</span></h4><p>Carpenter 13 – Ted Galen Carpenter, Senior Fellow at the Cato Institute and Contributing Editor to The National Interest, “Congress' Worst-of-Both-Worlds Approach to Foreign Policy”, National Interest, 11-13, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/congress-worst-both-worlds-approach-foreign-policy-9394  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/congress-worst-both-worlds-approach-foreign-policy-9394%27" tppabs="http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/congress-worst-both-worlds-approach-foreign-policy-9394"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/congress-worst-both-worlds-approach-foreign-policy-9394</span></a></span><br/>The role of Congress in the conduct of foreign policy has become nearly the opposite <br/>AND<br/>key reason why the Constitution established a presidency with significant, independent powers.<br/>At the same time, the founders wanted Congress to play a major role in the most crucial aspects of foreign affairs. Thus, all treaties had to receive approval by a two-thirds vote of the Senate. Even more graphic evidence of original intent was the provision regarding the war power. When it came to making the momentous decision about whether to take the republic to war, the Constitution gave Congress, not the president, that authority.<br/>What we have today is a perverse mirror image of that system. Presidents have usurped—and Congress has abdicated—the war power, yet Congress has become more involved in everyday diplomacy.<br/>The last time that Congress declared war, or was even asked to do so<br/>AND<br/>1990s, presidents acted without even the fig leaf of perfunctory congressional approval.<br/>With the recent Syrian crisis, President Barack Obama tried both approaches. Initially, <br/>AND<br/>circuited what might have been a refreshing reassertion of the congressional war power.<br/>Even as Congress became (at least until the Syria dispute) little more than a cipher regarding decisions about war and peace, it became increasingly active on measures that should properly be left to the executive branch. Three recent examples highlight that growing tendency to meddle in the day-to-day conduct of foreign affairs.<br/>One was a Senate resolution passed in the summer of 2013 regarding the highly sensitive territorial disputes in the South China and East China seas between China and neighboring states. Several of the “resolved” clauses in the resolution exhibited unsubtle criticism of and hostility toward China.<br/>Not surprisingly, the Chinese government reacted angrily to the passage (by an overwhelming <br/>AND<br/>mine field, and the Senate’s action increased the likelihood of a detonation.<br/>A second example of congressional meddling involves the sensitive matter of U.S. arms sales to Taiwan. The Obama administration, even more than its predecessors, has sought to pursue a “Goldilocks” strategy regarding the issue—selling just enough modern weapons to satisfy the Taiwanese government without enraging Beijing. That balancing act is inherently delicate and difficult, but recent congressional actions make it more so.<br/>Pressure (especially from the Republican-controlled House of Representatives) is mounting on <br/>AND<br/>the sale of Apache attack helicopters in 2014 and Patriot missiles in 2015.<br/>Beijing’s reaction to sales of the Apaches or Patriots would be anything but mild. Chinese officials regard those systems with only a little less hostility than they do the sale of advanced F-16’s. The Taiwan arms sale issue is sensitive enough without this kind of congressional meddling.<br/>The third, and potentially the most unhelpful and dangerous case of congressional interference involves <br/>AND<br/>Washington, which would help dampen an especially dangerous flashpoint in international affairs.<br/>One would hope that Congress would let the executive branch conduct this delicate diplomacy with <br/>AND<br/>such ultra hawks as Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham have long embraced.<br/>This is the worst sort of attempted congressional micromanagement of foreign affairs. The Iranian negotiations are at an especially sensitive point, and such interference could sabotage a potential breakthrough to foster peace in the most volatile region of the world. The executive branch needs to have wide latitude to pursue its diplomacy.<br/>Instead of such unhelpful, if not malicious, interference, Menendez and other members of Congress should concentrate on restoring the badly eroded congressional war power. The decision between war and peace is an exceptionally important responsibility that the Constitution vests in the legislative branch. It is alarming to see that legitimate power wither while members of Congress instead meddle in situations where the Constitution wisely gave the executive branch primary responsibility.</p><h4

congressional role in the conduct of U<br/>AND<br/>of foreign policy that were meant to be handled by the executive branch. <br/>Two recent incidents highlight that trend. &nbsp;One was a Senate resolution regarding the highly <br/>AND<br/>. foreign policy, especially to relations with a key power: China.<br/>On the surface, the Senate resolution seemed innocuous enough. &nbsp;It expressed the “strong support of the United States for the peaceful resolution of territorial, sovereignty, and jurisdictional disputes in the Asia-Pacific maritime domains.” &nbsp;The resolution also proclaimed that the United States “does not take a position on competing territorial claims over land features and maritime boundaries.” &nbsp;But despite such soothing language, the measure was a rather undiplomatic rebuke to China and its policies.<br/>It stressed a U.S. national interest in the disputes, including respect <br/>AND<br/>listed as posing a threat to those interests were attributed to Chinese actions. <br/>That aspect was especially unfair. &nbsp;The infamous naval “water cannons” battle between <br/>AND<br/>senators had nothing to say about such provocations from parties other than China.<br/>Indeed, the resolution enumerated several steps taken by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations <br/>AND<br/>and emphasized that Beijing in no way challenges Japan’s sovereignty over the island. <br/>Lest anyone in China miss the underlying message, the resolution went on to emphasize Washington’s support for Japan’s continuing administration of the Senkaku Islands (which China claims under the name Diaoyu Islands) and stressed that the bilateral U.S.-Japan defense treaty covered those islands, despite their disputed status. &nbsp;So much for the professed U.S. “neutrality” regarding territorial controversies!<br/>Several of the “resolved” clauses exhibited more than an undertone of criticism and <br/>AND<br/>,” to advance those goals could hardly be viewed in Beijing as friendly.<br/>Not surprisingly, the Chinese government reacted angrily to the passage (by an overwhelming <br/>AND<br/>its error “to avoid further complicating the issue

over disputed waters in Asia, U.S. military forces face the growing risk of conflict with the Chinese military, according to a draft congressional report.<br/>“Through its diplomatic actions and the rebalance to Asia, the United States has signaled its intent to strengthen its relationship with partners and allies in East Asia,” the forthcoming report of the U.S.-China Economic Security Review Commission states.<br/>“However, China’s military modernization, coupled with the potential decline in U.S. power caused by sequestration, is altering the balance of power in the region and reducing the deterrent effect of the rebalance policy. The risk is therefore increasing that China’s coercive approach to its sovereignty claims will lead to greater conflict in the region.”<br/>China is using its military forces to coerce Japan into giving up claims to the Senkaku Islands, and is also pressuring the Philippines to renounce its claims to the Spratlys in the South China Sea. Both regions are believed to harbor valuable undersea oil and gas reserves.<br/>The report said the sovereignty disputes in the East and South China seas are not new. But it warned that “China’s growing diplomatic, economic, and military clout is changing the regional security architecture.”<br/>“It is increasingly clear that China does not intend to resolve those disputes through multilateral negotiations or the application of international laws and adjudicative processes, but it will use its growing power in support of coercive tactics that pressure its neighbors to concede China’s claims,” said the report’s chapter on Asian maritime disputes.<br/>The late draft is dated Oct. 21 and the final report is set for release Nov. 20. A copy of the draft was obtained by Inside the Ring. A commission spokesman said the final report could change slightly from the draft.<br/>“The commissioners are very concerned about the way that the Defense Department budget and force structure is shaping up,” said a source close to the commission.<br/>“We were pretty strong on the need to maintain a credible naval and air presence in the Asia-Pacific and to live up to the Pentagon’s shift to a 60 percent force concentration in Asia. Obviously 60 percent of 200 ships is less than 60 percent of 300, and it looks like the People’s Liberation Army is moving toward a 300-ship navy.”<br/>The report said China is fueling maritime disputes domestically through “ardent popular nationalism” and by asserting its claims are “central” to national security.<br/>Key triggers to a future conflict are the Chinese system’s weak crisis-management structure and apparent divisions between the powerful Communist Party-controlled People’s Liberation Army and government Foreign Ministry.<br/>In January, the Chinese navy came close to triggering a naval shootout after a Chinese frigate locked its weapons radar on a Japanese ship. U.S. officials said it was the closest to a shooting incident since China began aggressive maritime actions several years ago.<br/>The report concludes that “Beijing’s tendency to demonstrate resolve in its maritime disputes; its large and complicated political, foreign affairs, and military bureaucracy; and its inconsistent adherence to internationally accepted norms of air and maritime operations may contribute to operational miscalculations in the East and South China seas.<br/>“Unyielding positions on sovereignty and nationalist sentiment surrounding these maritime disputes increase the risk of escalation from a miscalculation at sea to a political crisis,” it said.<br/>US/China relations solve multiple scenarios for extinction<br/>Wenzhong 4 – Wenzhong, PRC Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 2-7-4 (Zhou, “Vigorously Pushing Forward the Constructive and Cooperative Relationship Between China and the United States,” <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://china-japan21.org/eng/zxxx/t64286.htm)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://china-japan21.org/eng/zxxx/t64286.htm)%27" tppabs="http://china-japan21.org/eng/zxxx/t64286.htm)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://china-japan21.org/eng/zxxx/t64286.htm)</span></a></span><br/>China's development needs a peaceful international environment, particularly in its periphery.

Legal Reform and Strategies of Threatened Force<br/>Among legal scholars of war powers, the ultimate prescriptive question is whether the President <br/>AND<br/>own unilateral authority, such as deterring imminent attacks on the United States.<br/>Whereas legal scholars are consumed with the internal effects of war powers law, such <br/>AND<br/>above helps generate some initial hypotheses and avenues for further research and analysis.<br/>One might ask at this point why, though, having exposed as a hole <br/>AND<br/>augments the usual reform debate with appreciation for the importance of credible threats.<br/>A claim previously advanced from a presidentialist perspective is that stronger legislative checks on war <br/>AND<br/>deterrent diplomacy, even to head off explosive confrontations.”183 He continued:<br/>In the tense and cautious diplomacy of our present relations with the Soviet Union, as they have developed over the last twenty-five years, the authority of the President to set clear and silent limits in advance is perhaps the most important of all the powers in our constitutional armory to prevent confrontations that could carry nuclear implications. …<br/>It is the diplomatic power the President needs most under the circumstance of modern life—the power to make a credible threat to use force in order to prevent a confrontation which might escalate.184<br/>In his veto statement on the War Powers Resolution, President Nixon echoed these concerns<br/>AND<br/>preserved in legal doctrine, enhances the credibility of presidential threats to escalate.<br/>A second argument, this one advanced by some congressionalists, is that stronger legislative checks on presidential uses of force would improve deterrent and coercive strategies by making them more selective and credible. The most credible U.S. threats, this argument holds, are those that carry formal approval by Congress, which reflects strong public support and willingness to bear the costs of war.186</p><h3 id="HSolvency" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Solvency</span></h3><h4 id="HPlan2013TheUnitedStatesFederalGovernmentshouldrequireCongressionalauthorizationpriortoinitiatingoffensiveuseofmilitaryforceunlesstorepelattacksontheUnitedStates." class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Plan –<br/>The United States Federal Government should require Congressional authorization prior to initiating offensive use of military force unless to repel attacks on the United States.</span></h4><h4 id="HPlan2019stheperfectbalancethatcheckstheExecutivebutpreservesdefensivecapabilities" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Plan’s the perfect balance that checks the Executive but preserves defensive capabilities</span></h4><p>Lobel 8 – Jules Lobel, Professor at University of Pittsburgh Law School, “War Powers for the 21st Century: The Constitutional Perspective”, Testimony Before the Subcommittee on International Organizations, Human Rights and Oversight Committee on Foreign Affairs U.S. House of Representatives, 4-10, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://democrats.foreignaffairs.house.gov/110/lob041008.htm  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://democrats.foreignaffairs.house.gov/110/lob041008.htm%27" tppabs="http://democrats.foreignaffairs.house.gov/110/lob041008.htm"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://democrats.foreignaffairs.house.gov/110/lob041008.htm</span></a></span><br/>III Revising the War Powers Resolution¶ I believe that it is necessary and possible <br/>AND<br/>if you can fix any limit to his power in this respect.22</p><h4 id="HObamawillcomply" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Obama will comply</span></h4><p>Barron 8 – David J.

This is especially interesting from the perspective of constitutional powers debates, because it posits a distinct role for Congress – and, again, one that does not necessarily rely on Congress’s ability to pass binding legislation that formally confines the President.<br/>Kenneth Schultz, for instance, argues that the open nature of competition within democratic <br/>AND<br/>– make it difficult to conceal or misrepresent preferences about war and peace.<br/>Faced with such institutional constraints, Presidents will incline to be more selective about making <br/>AND<br/>political conditions domestically favor the use of force should it be necessary.169<br/>In some cases, Congress may communicate greater willingness than the president to use force, for instance through non-binding resolutions.170 Such powerful signals of resolve should in theory make adversaries more likely to back down.<br/>The credibility-enhancing effects of legislative constraints on threats are subject to dispute. <br/>AND<br/>as to how foreign leaders interpret political maneuvers within Congress regarding threatened force.<br/>Nevertheless, at the very least, strands of recent political science scholarship cast significant doubt on the intuition that democratic checks are inherently disadvantageous to strategies of threatened force. Quite the contrary, they suggest that legislative checks – or, indeed, even the signaling functions that Congress is institutionally situated to play with respect to foreign audiences interpreting U.S. government moves – can be harnessed in some circumstances to support such strategies.</p><p>?<br/>Legislative control makes threats credible and effective <br/>Waxman 13 – Matthew Waxman, Law Professor at Columbia Law School, “Constitutional Power to Threaten War: Three Points on Syria”, Lawfare Blog, 9-3, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.lawfareblog.com/2013/09/constitutional-power-to-threaten-war-three-points-on-syria/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.lawfareblog.com/2013/09/constitutional-power-to-threaten-war-three-points-on-syria/%27" tppabs="http://www.lawfareblog.com/2013/09/constitutional-power-to-threaten-war-three-points-on-syria/"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.lawfareblog.com/2013/09/constitutional-power-to-threaten-war-three-points-on-syria/</span></a></span></p><p>On the one hand, one might intuitively expect that robust democratic checks would generally <br/>AND<br/>credible and effective in resolving international crises without actual resort to armed conflict.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>A2: Debt Ceiling</p><p>Won’t pass- momentum, conclusive, no GOP support<br/>MSNBC, 9-13-2013 <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://maddowblog.msnbc.com/_news/2013/09/13/20477384-congress-on-crazy-pills?lite  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://maddowblog.msnbc.com/_news/2013/09/13/20477384-congress-on-crazy-pills?lite%27" tppabs="http://maddowblog.msnbc.com/_news/2013/09/13/20477384-congress-on-crazy-pills?lite"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://maddowblog.msnbc.com/_news/2013/09/13/20477384-congress-on-crazy-pills?lite</span></a></span></p><p>What do Boehner and GOP leaders intend to do?
