He served as <br/>AND<br/>civic_learning/crucible/documents/crucible_508f.pdf?</p><p>A Crucible Moment likewise calls for transformations necessary for this generation. A daunting one is to eliminate persistent inequalities, especially those in the United States determined by income and race, in order to secure the country’s economic and civic future. But the academy must also be a vehicle for tackling other pressing issues—growing global economic inequalities, climate change and environmental degradation, lack of access to quality health care, economic volatility, and more. To do that requires expanding students’ capacities to be civic problem-solvers using all their powers of intellect and inventiveness. Sixty-five years after the Truman Commission, the nation faces a different national and global dynamic than in the aftermath of World War II. A Crucible Moment casts its National Call to Action in the context of five trends that shape this historic juncture. Increase in Democratic nations: In 1950, just over 25 percent of countries in the world could be characterized as electoral democracies (Diamond 2011). In 2010, 59 percent of countries could be characterized in this way (Puddington 2011). Moreover, "in 1975 the number of countries that were ’not free’ exceeded those that were ’free’ by 50 percent, ~but~ by 2007 twice as many countries were ’free’ as were ’not free’ (Goldstone 2010, 1). According to an official statement released by the Arab Network for the Study of Democracy, the Arab Spring of 2011 brought people in seven countries to the streets united by three notions: freedom, dignity, and justice (Lee 2011). These shifts offer significant opportunities for revitalizing all democracies, both old and new, as modern democracies learn collectively how to recalibrate democratic processes to meet the new demands of a globalized age. Intensified Global Competition: After World War II, the United States competed only with the Soviet Union for global domination as other nations were busy either putting their devastated economies back in order or developing them. Today, powerful new economies exist on every continent. The European Union is challenging US economic domination, and there is a decided tilt toward the Asian markets of China, India, and Japan. In this globalized world, the budgets of many multinational companies are larger than those of many countries, and they are not bound in their practices by any one nation. Dangerous Economic Inequalities: While the United States had been moving toward a diamond-shaped economy with a larger middle class, recent years have seen an increased gulf between rich and poor across US households. Economist Edward N. Wolff notes, for example, that between 2007 and mid 2009 there was "a fairly steep rise in wealth inequality ~where~ the share of the top 1 percent advanced from 34.6 to 37.1 percent, that of the top 5 percent from 61.8 to 65 percent, and that of the top quintile from 85 to 87.7 percent, while that of second quintile fell from 10.9 to 10 percent, that of the middle quintile from 4 to 3.1 percent, and that of the bottom two quintiles from 0.2 to -0.8 percent" (Wolff 2010, 33). In sum, as of 2009, nearly 90 percent of wealth was concentrated among the top 20 percent of US households, while just over 10 percent of wealth was spread across the remaining 80 percent. One result of this hyper-consolidation of wealth is that for the first time in US history, the younger generation is not on a trajectory to achieve their parents’ economic level. These same economic inequalities are even more dramatic in a global context. According to former UN Humanitarian Relief Coordinator Jan Egeland. "The richest individuals are richer than several of the poorest nations combined—a few billionaires are richer than the poorest two billion people" ( <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://ucatlas./  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://ucatlas./%27" tppabs="http://ucatlas./"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://ucatlas.</span></a></span> ucsc.edu/income.php). Economist Branko Milanovic (2000) has found that the ratio of the average income of the top 5 percent of the world’s population to the bottom 5 percent increased from 78 to 1 in 1988 to 114 to 1 in 1993. In the case of sub-Saharan Africa, a whole region has been left behind: it will account for almost one-third of world poverty in 2015, up from one-fifth in 1990 (United Nations Development Programme 2007). Demographic Diversity: The United States is "the most religiously diverse nation on earth" (Eck 2002, 4), and is more racially diverse than ever. By 2045 communities of color will constitute at least 50 percent nationwide (Roberts 2008), as is already the case in some states. Immigrants now make up 12.5 percent of the US population (Gryn and Larsen 2010). Intensified immigration and refugee populations swirling around the entire globe have resulted in similarly dramatic demographic shifts on almost every continent. Having the capacity to draw on core democratic processes to negotiate the increased diversity will secure a stable future. technological Advances: In 1945, televisions were a rarity and many sections of the country were just getting telephone lines and electricity. The impact of computers and information technology today is reminiscent of the transformation wrought by the Industrial Age: all facets of everyday livingare affected, from communication to health care, from industry to energy, and from educational pedagogies to democratic practices. The Internet— particularly the development of social media to organize groups of people around commonly shared values—influences democratic engagement and activism, as dramatically illustrated by the 2011 Arab Spring and the 2008 US presidential election. While the historical dynamics that shaped the Truman Commission’s findings may differ from today’s political and social environment, a number of stubborn problems that existed then continue to erode the foundation of our democracy. The most pressing of these are unequal access to college and economic lethargy. Although access has increased dramatically, unequal access continues to plague democracy’s ability to thrive. Students are underprepared for college because of what writer and educator Jonathan Kozol (1991) refers to as "the savage inequalities" of the nation’s K–12 system. The poorer the young person, the less likely he or she will go to college. Yet SAT scores, which directly correlate with income, continue to determine many students’ qualifications to attend college. Failure to graduate from high school shuts off college as an option for nearly 30 percent of our nation’s young people; researchers James Heckman and Paul LaFontaine (2007) note that high school graduation rates have leveled or declined over four decades, and the "majority/minority graduation rate differentials are substantial and have not converged over the past 35 years." In a new foreword to The Drama of Diversity and Democracy: Higher Education and American Commitments, Ramón A. Gutiérrez illustrates Latinos’ attrition along the educational pipeline in the United States. While they are the fastest growing racial minority, surpassing the percentage of African Americans, education is not providing a democratic pathway to economic independence or social mobility. Drawing on research by Armida Ornelas and Daniel Solórzano, Gutiérrez explains that "of every one hundred Latinos who enroll in elementary school, fifty-three will drop out," and of the forty-seven who graduate from high school, "only twenty-six will pursue some form of postsecondary education" and "only eight will graduate with baccalaureate degrees" (Gutiérrez 2011, xvi). In the face of troubling discrepancies among racial and socioeconomic groups, there is some good news in the longer term regarding the nation’s increasing college graduation rates. In 1940, only 24 percent of the population 25 years and older had completed high school, and just under 5 percent held a bachelor’s degree (Bauman and Graf 2003). Seventy years later, those numbers have progressed dramatically. "Of the 3.2 million youth age 16 to 24 who graduated from high school between January and October 2010, about 2.2 million (68.1 percent) were enrolled in college in October 2010" (Bureau of Labor Statistics 2011). Overall college graduation rates have also improved: the Digest of Education Statistics 2010, for example, reports that for those seeking the bachelor’s degree, the rate of graduation within four years has reached 36.4 percent. Within six years, it jumps to 57.2 percent. For those seeking an associate’s degree, the graduation rate within six years is 27.5 percent (Snyder and Dillow 2011). According to the 2011 Education at a Glance report completed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the labor force in the United States is among the world’s top five most highly educated. However, OECD’s report explains, "The US is the only country where attainment levels among those just entering the labor market (25–34 year-olds) do not exceed those about to leave the labor market (55–64 yearolds)." As a result, "among 25–34 year-olds, the US ranks 15th among 34 OECD countries in tertiary attainment" (OECD 2011, 2). In other words, the educational attainment level in the United States has remained relatively flat while other countries have rapidly increased and surpassed us. An attainment rate that qualified the United States to be near the top of the world several decades ago is not a guarantee of retaining world leadership educationally. Neither graduation rates nor attainment rates that were sufficient in the past are satisfactory today, when two-thirds of future jobs will require some type of postsecondary credential. There is a strong link between educational level and preparedness for a newly demanding workplace, just as there is a strong link between educational level and other civic indicators, including voting. A high-quality education, workforce preparation, and civic engagement are inextricably linked. A college education—who has access to it, and who completes the degree—affects personal ambitions, the economy, and civic participation. After World War II, the United States invested in higher education as a vehicle to jump-start economic expansion. The community college sector in particular was dramatically expanded to provide people with new access to college and new technical skills. In today’s economy, higher education is once again viewed as a way graduates can achieve greater economic mobility and our lethargic economy can be stimulated. In 1947, with the world in shambles, new structures, alliances, and programs were created in an attempt to avert future catastrophic wars, to reconstruct multiple economies, and to establish common principles of justice and equality. As the Truman Commission demonstrates, political and educational leaders agreed that higher education was needed to educate students for international understanding and cooperation to secure a sustainable future. Although today’s world is more globally integrated financially, culturally, and demographically, it is also fraught with civil and regional wars, clashing values, and environmental challenges wrought by rapacious consumption and carelessness. Citizens who have never examined any of these issues will be left vulnerable in the face of their long-term consequences. How to achieve sustainability—understood in its broadest definition as including strong communities, economic viability, and a healthy planet—is the democratic conundrum of the day. If it is not solved, everyone’s future well-being will be in jeopardy. Meanwhile, students’ economic options are heavily influenced by two long-term trends: the requirement of a college credential for the twenty-firstcentury employment market, and the inadequacy of federal and state funds that could make higher education more widely available. After World War II, the majority of jobs in the United States did not require a college degree, yet many—especially in unionized fields—offered a middle-class living wage and benefits. Today, a college degree is the credential that a high school diploma once was. According to a 2010 report, Projections of Jobs and Education Requirements through 2018, of the 46.8 million new and replacement job openings in 2018, 34 percent will require a bachelor’s degree or better, while 30 percent will require at least some college or a two-year associate’s degree. (Carnevale, Smith, and Strohl 2010, 110). As the report’s authors describe this societal sea change, "…postsecondary education or training has become the threshold requirement for access to middle-class status and earnings in good times and bad. It is no longer the preferred pathway to middle-class jobs—it is, increasingly, the only pathway" (110). This higher educational bar is imposed as colleges and universities continue to cope with the effects of the recession and budget deficits at both state and federal levels. Higher education is often the vehicle that states use to balance their budgets. The sector does well in good times and is hit harder in lean ones. According to a 2011 report issued by the National Conference of State Legislatures, total state support for higher education institutions fell by 1.5 percent in FY 2009. Without federal funding from the American Reinvestment and Renewal Act (ARRA), this decline would have been 3.4 percent. In 2010, twenty-three states decreased state support of public higher education institutions, even after receiving ARRA funds. Eight of these states reported drops in higher education funding exceeding 5 percent (National Conference of State Legislatures 2011). These compounding factors produce our crucible moment today. The country, the economy, and the world demand a different kind of expertise than was required of graduates after World War II. The kind of graduates we need at this moment in history need to possess a strong propensity for wading into an intensely interdependent, pluralist world. They need to be agile, creative problem solvers who draw their knowledge from multiple perspectives both domestic and global, who approach the world with empathy, and who are ready to act with others to improve the quality of life for all. Another name for these graduates is democratic citizens. In the face of the constellation of forces described in the previous chapter, this crucible moment in US history might look daunting. Certain lessons from the Truman Commission, however, should spur people to action, not paralysis. Despite the ravages of World War II and the resultant worldwide economic devastation, the Commission was ambitious in its scope, calling for bold leadership and investment of public funds and reaffirming the public mission of higher education as a reservoir for progress for the nation and the world. That same visionary leadership is necessary today. The Truman Commission also imagined long-term, systemic change— within both higher education and the nation at large—as an answer to the dire challenges of the day. In a revolutionary stand, the Commission named racial segregation, inequality of any kind, and intolerance as impediments to economic advancement and affronts to democratic values. This twentyfirst-century juncture likewise demands deep structural reforms in higher education and the broader society. As Charles Quigley’s (2011) epigraph to this report states, "Each generation must work…to narrow the gap between the ideals of this nation and the reality of the daily lives of its people." Today, colleges and universities must once again serve as "the carrier~s~ of democratic values, ideals, and process," but for a new age confronting new challenges (President’s Commission on Higher Education 1947a). Putting civic learning at the core rather than the periphery of primary, secondary, and postsecondary education can have far-reaching positive consequences for the country and the economy. It can be a powerful counterforce to the civic deficit and a means of replenishing civic capital. That restored capital, in turn, can function as a self-renewing resource for strengthening democracy and re-establishing vitality, opportunity, and development broadly across the socioeconomic spectrum and even beyond national borders. As Martin Luther King Jr. (2011) accurately noted, we are all "tied in a single garment of destiny." If indeed we seek a democratic society in which the public welfare matters as much as the individual’s welfare, and in which global welfare matters along with national welfare, then education must play its influential part to bring such a society into being. As Ira Harkavy (2011) asserts in the epigraph to this chapter, that will require a commitment to "develop and maintain the particular type of education system conducive to it." A Crucible Moment posits that the nature of that particular type of education must be determined at the local institutional level in order to construct civic-minded colleges and universities. In Chapter I we argued that such campuses are distinguished by a civic ethos governing campus life; civic literacy as a goal for every graduate; civic inquiry integrated within majors, general education, and technical training; and informed civic action in concert with others as lifelong practice. If Chapter I established the urgency of reinvesting in education for democracy and civic responsibility and Chapter II demonstrated that ambitious action was possible in the face of earlier difficult historical eras, this chapter comprises a National Call to Action: recommendations that can begin to erase the current civic learning shortfall. These recommendations are meant to shift and enhance the national dialogue about civic learning and democratic engagement and to mobilize constituents to take action. Everyone has a role and everyone must act, with participation and deliberation across differences as vibrant democracies require. We invite each constituent group to use this report and its National Call to Action as a guideline to chart a course of action—tailoring, for example, the strategies and tasks to be accomplished, the entities responsible for each effort, the partners to be engaged, the timeline for action, and other particulars—that would most effectively respond in the exigencies of this crucible moment. We encourage readers to expand and refine this report’s recommendations and make them locally relevant by institution, region, issue, and demographics. In Appendix A, we provide a mechanism for doing so in the form of tools to help each participating entity develop its own Civic Investment Plan. Readers are encouraged to work collectively within self-designated spheres to develop a plan for exactly what they can and will do to make civic learning and democratic engagement a meaningful national priority. As described in the opening pages of this report, the National Call to Action is the product of a broad coalition of people. The idea for bringing such a group together began with the US Department of Education, which commissioned the report, funded it, and nurtured it. From the beginning, the department acknowledged the widespread civic engagement movement that has been working for decades both on and off campus. The design for the project deliberately drew from that expertise and charged leaders in civic renewal efforts to envision the next frontiers of civic learning and democratic engagement in higher education. Assuming that the best solutions would be generated by people responsible for moving from a set of recommendations to purposeful action, the department charged the National Task Force on Civic Learning and Democratic Engagement with making recommendations—to the government and to higher education—that were informed by the expertise and experience of the leaders and essential partners of the civic renewal movement already underway. A staunch partner in promoting civic learning and democratic engagement throughout the process, the department nonetheless made clear that A Crucible Moment was to be the Task Force’s report not the department’s, prepared in dialogue with a very broad community of advisers. Those advisers who were participants in five different national roundtables, and whose names are listed in Appendix C are civic practitioners, scholars, and administrators. They generated what became an evolving set of specific recommendations included in this chapter. The National Task Force continued to refine the recommendations in subsequent drafts. There was consensus among participants that a successful Call to Action would require multiple leaders collaborating from varying constituencies both within and beyond higher education and within and beyond government agencies. The broad swath of recommendations that emerged reflects that consensus. K–12 education is the cornerstone for both functioning democracies and college readiness. As Ira Harkavy (2011) said in his address at the international conference "Reimagining Democratic Societies," "no effective democratic schooling system, no democratic society. Higher education has the potential to powerfully contribute to the democratic transformation of schools, communities, and societies." Despite all the investment in improving the level of schooling in the United States, particularly over the past quarter century, far too little attention has been paid to education for democracy in public schools. In their foreword to the report Guardian of Democracy: The Civic Mission of Schools, former Justice Sandra Day O’Connor and former Congressman Lee Hamilton note, "Knowledge of our system of governance and our rights and responsibilities as citizens is not passed along through the gene pool. Each generation of Americans must be taught these basics" (2011, 5). The arguments for the civic purpose of K–12 education and the arguments for the civic mission of higher education are similar. Education for democratic engagement is even more urgent than it has ever been, given America’s current diverse populace and global interdependencies. Revealingly, the definition of civic learning put forth in Guardian of Democracy encompasses a continuum across educational levels—in both pedagogy and curricula—that is consistent with an enlarged definition of civic literacies cited in Chapter I of this report, the framework for twenty-first-century civic learning provided in figure 1, and the examples of campus practices featured in Chapter V. Research in 2009 about civic learning in K–12 by Judith Torney-Purta and Britt S. Wilkenfeld echoes findings in higher education. Torney-Purta and Wilkenfeld suggest, for example, that the educational outcomes proceeding from well-constructed civics curricula overlap with the knowledge and skills needed in the workplace. Similarly, their research finds that engaged pedagogies in K–12 that accelerate empowered, student-centered learning also enhance both constructive civic/political participation skills and parallel skills of collaboration, so valuable in the workplace. Finally, they find that classrooms that are civically oriented across multiple kinds of subjects also contribute to students’ motivation to do well and, therefore, to the likelihood that students will stay in school. The Campaign for the Civic Mission of Schools therefore argues there should be three C’s driving reform in K–12 education: college, career, and citizenship (see www.civicmissionofschools.org). Unfortunately, the current public discourse—driven by multiple public, business, and governmental sectors—focuses disproportionately on the first two. The 2011 Educational Testing Services report The Mission of High School voices this concern in a chapter called "A Narrowing of Purpose and Curriculum?" Diane Ravitch is quoted about the grievous consequences to democracy’s health of not setting high expectations across an array of subjects in schools but instead focusing on only a few subjects that are narrowly judged in high stakes testing: "A society that turns its back on the teaching of history encourages mass amnesia, leaving the public ignorant of the important events and ideas of the human past and eroding the civic intelligence needed for the future. A democratic society that fails to teach the younger generation the principles of self-government puts these principles at risk" (Barton and Coley 2011, 25–26). The omission of civic goals for education occurs even in the face of evidence that civic engagement contributes to academic success. As reported by the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE), "Longitudinal studies show that young people who serve their community and join civic associations succeed in school and in life better than their peers who do not engage" (Levine 2011, 15). Parallel findings across K–12 and postsecondary education suggest that (1) comprehensive civic goals need to be included in standards to be assessed at state and national levels; (2) civic development for teachers in schools needs to be supported; and (3) schools of education need to integrate civic learning and democratic engagement into the curricula that prepare our nation’s teachers. Recognizing the need for a reinvestment in civic learning, thoughtful K–12 educators and leaders have developed a framework that accords with the vision and argument of this report (see particularly the Campaign for the Civic Mission of Schools 2011a, 2011b, www.civicmissionofschools.org/site/ resources/civiccompetencies.html, and Guardians of Democracy). The timing is right, then, to form sturdy bridges to civic learning and democratic engagement across students’ lifelong learning trajectories. Without K–12 education laying the foundations for civic responsibility and developing students’ understandings of democracy’s history and principles, any hopes of raising national civic literacy and civic agency are likely to be undermined, both for college students and, even more so, for high school graduates who may never enroll in college.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HTheheuristic2019simpactisenormous.Itincludesthisroom2Cbutextendsbeyondit." class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>The heuristic’s impact is enormous.

The unipolar moment will pass. In facing this circumstance, American grand strategy should be informed by answers to this question: What sort of international order would we like to see in place in 2020 or 2030 when America is less powerful? Grand strategy is a set of coordinated and sustained policies designed to address the long-term threats and opportunities that lie beyond the country’s shores. Given the great shifts in the global system and the crisis of liberal hegemonic order, how should the United States pursue grand strategy in the coming years? The answer is that the United States should work with others to rebuild and renew the institutional foundations of the liberal international order and along the way re-establish its own authority as a global leader. The United States is going to need to invest in alliances, partnerships, multilateral institutions, special relationships, great-power concerts, cooperative security pacts, and democratic security communities. That is, the United States will need to return to the great tasks of liberal order building. It is useful to distinguish between two types of grand strategy: positional and milieu oriented. With a positional grand strategy, a great power seeks to diminish the power or threat embodied in a specific challenger state or group of states. Examples are Nazi Germany, Imperial Japan, the Soviet bloc, and perhaps—in the future—Greater China. With a milieu-oriented grand strategy, a great power does not target a specific state but seeks to structure its general international environment in ways that are congenial with its long-term security. This might entail building the infrastructure of international cooperation, promoting trade and democracy in various regions of the world, and establishing partnerships that might be useful for various contingencies. My point is that under conditions of unipolarity, in a world of diffuse threats, and with pervasive uncertainty over what the specific security challenges will be in the future, this milieu-based approach to grand strategy is necessary. The United States does not face the sort of singular geopolitical threat that it did with the fascist and communist powers of the last century. Indeed, compared with the dark days of the 1930s or the Cold War, America lives in an extraordinarily benign security environment. Rather than a single overriding threat, the United States and other countries face a host of diffuse and evolving threats. Global warming, nuclear proliferation, jihadist terrorism, energy security, health pandemics—these and other dangers loom on the horizon. Any of these threats could endanger Americans’ lives and way of life either directly or indirectly by destabilizing the global system upon which American security and prosperity depends. What is more, these threats are interconnected—and it is their interactive effects that represent the most acute danger. And if several of these threats materialize at the same time and interact to generate greater violence and instability, then the global order itself, as well as the foundations of American national security, would be put at risk. What unites these threats and challenges is that they are all manifestations of rising security interdependence. More and more of what goes on in other countries matters for the health and safety of the United States and the rest of the world. Many of the new dangers—such as health pandemics and transnational terrorist violence—stem from the weakness of states rather than their strength. At the same time, technologies of violence are evolving, providing opportunities for weak states or nonstate groups to threaten others at a greater distance. When states are in a situation of security interdependence, they cannot go it alone. They must negotiate and cooperate with other states and seek mutual restraints and protections. The United States can-not hide or protect itself from threats under conditions of rising security interdependence. It must get out in the world and work with other states to build frameworks of cooperation and leverage capacities for action against this unusually diverse, diffuse, and unpredictable array of threats and challenges. This is why a milieu-based grand strategy is attractive. The objective is to shape the international environment to maximize your capacities to protect the nation from threats. To engage in liberal order building is to invest in international cooperative frameworks—that is, rules, institutions, partnerships, networks, standby capacities, social knowledge, etc.—in which the United States operates. To build international order is to increase the global stock of "social capital"—which is the term Pierre Bourdieu, Robert Putnam, and other social scientists have used to define the actual and potential resources and capacities within a political community, manifest in and through its networks of social relations, that are available for solving collective problems. If American grand strategy is to be organized around liberal order building, what are the specific objectives and what is the policy agenda? There are five such objectives. First, the United States needs to lead in the building of an enhanced protective infrastructure that helps prevent the emergence of threats and limits the damage if they do materialize. Many of the threats mentioned above are manifest as socioeconomic backwardness and failure that cause regional and international instability and conflict. These are the sorts of threats that are likely to arise with the coming of global warming and epidemic disease. What is needed here is institutional cooperation to strengthen the capacity of governments and the international com-munity to prevent epidemics or food shortages or mass migrations that create global upheaval—and mitigate the effects of these upheavals if they occur. The international system already has a great deal of this protective infrastructure—institutions and networks that pro-mote cooperation over public health, refugees, and emergency aid. But as the scale and scope of potential problems grow in the twenty-first century, investments in these preventive and management capacities will also need to grow. Early warning systems, protocols for emergency operations, standby capacities, etc.—these safeguards are the stuff of a protective global infrastructure. Second, the United States should recommit to and rebuild its security alliances. The idea is to update the old bargains that lie behind these security pacts. In NATO, but also in the East Asia bilateral partner-ships, the United States agrees to provide security protection to the other states and brings its partners into the process of decision-making over the use of force. In return, these partners agree to work with the United States—providing manpower, logistics, and other types of support—in wider theaters of action. The United States gives up some autonomy in strategic decision-making, although it is more an informal restraint than a legally binding one, and in exchange it gets cooperation and political support. Third, the United States should reform and create encompassing global institutions that foster and legitimate collective action. The first move here should be to reform the United Nations, starting with the expansion of the permanent membership on the Security Council. Several plans have been proposed. All of them entail adding new members—such as Germany, Japan, India, Brazil, South Africa, and others—and reforming the voting procedures. Almost all of the candidates for permanent membership are mature or rising democracies. The goal, of course, is to make them stakeholders in the United Nations and thereby strengthen the primacy of the UN as a vehicle for global collective action. There really is no substitute for the legitimacy that the United Nations can offer to emergency actions—humanitarian interventions, economic sanctions, uses of force against terrorists, and so forth. Public support in advanced democracies grows rapidly when their governments can stand behind a UN-sanctioned action. Fourth, the United States should accommodate and institution-ally engage China. China will most likely be a dominant state, and the United States will need to yield to it in various ways. The United States should respond to the rise of China by strengthening the rules and institutions of the liberal international order—deepening their roots, integrating rising capitalist democracies, sharing authority and functional roles. The United States should also intensify cooperation with Europe and renew joint commitments to alliances and multilateral global governance. The more that China faces not just the United States but the entire world of capitalist democracies, the better. This is not to argue that China must face a grand counterbalancing alliance against it. Rather, it should face a complex and highly integrated global system—one that is so encompassing and deeply entrenched that it essentially has no choice but to join it and seek to prosper within it. The United States should also be seeking to construct a regional security order in East Asia that can provide a framework for managing the coming shifts. The idea is not to block China’s entry into the regional order but to help shape its terms, looking for opportunities to strike strategic bargains at various moments along the shifting power trajectories and encroaching geopolitical spheres. The big bargain that the United States will want to strike is this: to accommodate a rising China by offering it status and position within the regional order in return for Beijing’s acceptance and accommodation of Washington’s core strategic interests, which include remaining a dominant security provider within East Asia. In striking this strategic bargain, the United States will also want to try to build multilateral institutional arrangements in East Asia that will tie China to the wider region. Fifth, the United States should reclaim a liberal internationalist public philosophy. When American officials after World War II championed the building of a rule-based postwar order, they articulated a distinctive internationalist vision of order that has faded in recent decades. It was a vision that entailed a synthesis of liberal and realist ideas about economic and national security, and the sources of stable and peaceful order. These ideas—drawn from the experiences with the New Deal and the previous decades of war and depression—led American leaders to associate the national interest with the building of a managed and institutionalized global system. What is needed today is a renewed public philosophy of liberal internationalism—a shift away from neoliberal-ism—that can inform American elites as they make trade-offs between sovereignty and institutional cooperation. Under this philosophy, the restraint and the commitment of American power went hand in hand. Global rules and institutions advanced America’s national interest rather than threatened it. The alternative public philosophies that have circulated in recent years—philosophies that champion American unilateralism and disentanglement from global rules and institutions—did not meet with great success. So an opening exists for America’s postwar vision of internationalism to be updated and rearticulated today. The United States should embrace the tenets of this liberal public philosophy: Lead with rules rather than dominate with power; provide public goods and connect their provision to cooperative and accommodative policies of others; build and renew international rules and institutions that work to reinforce the capacities of states to govern and achieve security and economic success; keep the other liberal democracies close; and let the global system itself do the deep work of liberal modernization. As it navigates this brave new world, the United States will find itself needing to share power and rely in part on others to ensure its security. It will not be able to depend on unipolar power or airtight borders. It will need, above all else, authority and respect as a global leader. The United States has lost some of that authority and respect in recent years. In committing itself to a grand strategy of liberal order building, it can begin the process of gaining it back.</p><h3 id="HSOP" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>SOP</span></h3><h4 id="HUncheckedwarpowersetsaprecedentthatcausestheexecutivetobroadlyignoreCongressionalcontrols" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Unchecked war power sets a precedent that causes the executive to broadly ignore Congressional controls</span></h4><p><strong>Barron 8</strong> – David J.

The whole intent of the Framers of the Constitution was quite the reverse. So Congressman Rohrabacher’s instinct really leads down, I think, two impractical cul de sacs. And the only way out of that is to enact framework legislation, like the War Powers Resolution, that makes the use of the appropriations or war powers practicable.<br/>REP. DELAHUNT: I don’t know whether it was Dr. Fisher or Mr. Lobel, but one of you made the statement that there has not been a single instance of hostilities which would have warranted the kind of approach that Mr. Rohrabacher would have made.<br/>MR. LOBEL: (Off mike.)<br/>REP. DELAHUNT: Hit the button again. Thank you.<br/>MR. LOBEL: If you look at the history over the last 30 or 40 years, all of the uses of force that the president claimed are so essential to national security, in each of those cases there could have been time to come to Congress and get congressional authorization. None of them was such an emergency that Congress couldn’t have been involved. The only question —<br/>REP. DELAHUNT: Which we did in the case of Iraq.<br/>MR. LOBEL: Right. And the only question is then, why not go to Congress? And the reason you don’t want to go to Congress is because Congress is slow, Congress might be divided. But the point is is that if Congress is divided —<br/>REP. DELAHUNT: Congress is a constitutional nuisance to the executive.<br/>MR. LOBEL: Yeah, that would be what I would say.

But Obama abruptly jettisoned that plan and announced he would seek the approval of Congress. An attack, if there is to be one, could be postponed for weeks, jeopardizing what’s known as and#34;peakand#34; military readiness.<br/>Earlier, in June, the White House announced it would send small arms and munitions to the Syrian rebels. By early September, however, no weapons had reached the rebels.<br/>So hesitation, delay, and unreliability are the hallmarks of Obama’s approach to Syria, for now. This amounts to presidential and#34;fecklessness,and#34; says Steven F.

There’s a gulf between his mission and his military. His goal is the removal of Assad as Syrian leader —in other words, regime change. But Obama insists a bombing attack in Syria would be solely to stop further use of chemical weapons.

They also raise questions as to the wisdom of the discretionary war powers claimed by these presidents: claims not effectively challenged since the Truman precedent.<br/>I suggest a remedy—a turn to prospective rather than standard retrospective accountability—by putting the war policy on trial before the president may initiate hostilities, rather than waiting until after the costs have incurred. When time permits, Congress should mandate a prospective review before the president is authorized to send in any troops.<br/>Prospective review has been averted not by lack of congressional power, but by some <br/>AND<br/>war policy, in which they clearly have an actual role to play.<br/>Needed, therefore, is a formal procedure featuring an authentic debate on the merits, and not merely rally events with little more than temporary emotional support for the president’s war policy. Putting a war policy on trial before it is implemented will either avoid ill-advised wars or build more durable support for wars found justifiable.<br/>Currently, policy trials are not politically feasible. But the failure of the War Powers Resolution of 1973 and the timidity of the recently proposed War Powers Consultation Act of 200963 suggest that anything noncontroversial enough to be politically feasible will not be strong enough to work. So before addressing the feasibility issue we should first ask what could be strong enough to work without altering the Constitution. I propose a policy trial.<br/>Conclusion: Policy Trials<br/>The model for policy trials is the impeachment process, as described in Article 1 sections 2 and 3 of the Constitution, where the prospective war policy, and not the president, is examined. The power to establish a policy trial process is in Article 1 Section 4, which grants each House the right to determine the rules of its own proceedings.<br/>The process, triggered by a majority vote of the House, would impose special rules of order designed to create a debate on the merits before any congressional resolution or declaration of war is possible.<br/>Invoking the procedure implies that the president must formally defend the proposal against well-prepared opponents, with the Chief Justice presiding and the Senate empanelled as the jury. Importantly, this entails a temporary suspension of traditional deference to the president, who is now free to evade, steer or obstruct such debate at any time.<br/>Most importantly, invoking the procedure signals the public that something rare and serious has <br/>AND<br/>and 1937, which kept a frustrated President Roosevelt from helping the allies.<br/>These examples suggest that policy trials could help crystallize a public consensus, which in turn could influence and politically protect members of Congress, who typically follow the public’s lead.<br/>A final question: are policy trials an attack on the presidency? No, <br/>AND<br/>reduce the system-draining recriminations that followed Korea, Vietnam and Iraq.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HClosingloopholesensuresnocircumvention" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Closing loopholes ensures no circumvention</span></h4><p><strong>Underwood 12</strong>(Matthew, J.D.

The answer is: almost nothing for more than 10 years. Monthly values of the global temperature anomaly of the lower atmosphere, compiled at the University of Alabama from NASA satellite data, can be found at the website <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.drroyspencer.com/latest-global-temperatures/.  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.drroyspencer.com/latest-global-temperatures/.%27" tppabs="http://www.drroyspencer.com/latest-global-temperatures/."><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.drroyspencer.com/latest-global-temperatures/.</span></a></span> The latest (February 2012) monthly global temperature anomaly for the lower atmosphere was minus 0.12 degrees Celsius, slightly less than the average since the satellite record of temperatures began in 1979. The lack of any statistically significant warming for over a decade has made it more difficult for the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and its supporters to demonize the atmospheric gas CO2 which is released when fossil fuels are burned. The burning of fossil fuels has been one reason for an increase of CO2 levels in the atmosphere to around 395 ppm (or parts per million), up from preindustrial levels of about 280 ppm. CO2 is not a pollutant. Life on earth flourished for hundreds of millions of years at much higher CO2 levels than we see today. Increasing CO2 levels will be a net benefit because cultivated plants grow better and are more resistant to drought at higher CO2 levels, and because warming and other supposedly harmful effects of CO2 have been greatly exaggerated. Nations with affordable energy from fossil fuels are more prosperous and healthy than those without. The direct warming due to doubling CO2 levels in the atmosphere can be calculated to cause a warming of about one degree Celsius. The IPCC computer models predict a much larger warming, three degrees Celsius or even more, because they assume changes in water vapor or clouds that supposedly amplify the direct warming from CO2. Many lines of observational evidence suggest that this "positive feedback" also has been greatly exaggerated. There has indeed been some warming, perhaps about 0.8 degrees Celsius, since the end of the so-called Little Ice Age in the early 1800s. Some of that warming has probably come from increased amounts of CO2, but the timing of the warming—much of it before CO2 levels had increased appreciably—suggests that a substantial fraction of the warming is from natural causes that have nothing to do with ~hu~mankind. Frustrated by the lack of computer-predicted warming over the past decade, some IPCC supporters have been claiming that "extreme weather" has become more common because of more CO2. But there is no hard evidence this is true. After an unusually cold winter in 2011 (December 2010-February 2011) the winter of 2012 was unusually warm in the continental United States. But the winter of 2012 was bitter in Europe, Asia and Alaska. Weather conditions similar to 2012 occurred in the winter of 1942, when the U.S. Midwest was unusually warm, and when the Wehrmacht encountered the formidable forces of "General Frost" in a Russian winter not unlike the one Russians just had. Large fluctuations from warm to cold winters have been the rule for the U.S., as one can see from records kept by the National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA. For example, the winters of 1932 and 1934 were as warm as or warmer than the 2011-2012 one and the winter of 1936 was much colder. Nightly television pictures of the tragic destruction from tornadoes over the past months might make one wonder if the frequency of tornadoes is increasing, perhaps due to the increasing levels of CO2 in the atmosphere. But as one can read at Andrew Revkin’s New York Times blog, dotearth, "There is no evidence of any trend in the number of potent tornadoes (category F2 and up) over the past 50 years in the United States, even as global temperatures have risen markedly." Like winter temperatures, the numbers, severity and geographical locations of tornadoes fluctuate from year-to-year in ways that are correlated with the complicated fluid flow patterns of the oceans and atmosphere, the location of the jet stream, El Niño or La Niña conditions of the tropical Pacific Oceans, etc. As long as the laws of nature exist, we will have tornadoes. But we can save many more lives by addressing the threat of tornadoes directly—for example, with improved and more widely dispersed weather radars, and with better means for warning the people of endangered areas—than by credulous support of schemes to reduce "carbon footprints," or by funding even more computer centers to predict global warming. It is easy to be confused about climate, because we are constantly being warned about the horrible things that will happen or are already happening as a result of mankind’s use of fossil fuels. But these ominous predictions are based on computer models. It is important to distinguish between what the climate is actually doing and what computer models predict. The observed response of the climate to more CO2 is not in good agreement with model predictions.</p><p><strong>No uniqueness for their link and the plan generates bipartisan support</strong><br/><strong>Meyer and Barnes 7</strong>(Josh Meyer and Julian E.
