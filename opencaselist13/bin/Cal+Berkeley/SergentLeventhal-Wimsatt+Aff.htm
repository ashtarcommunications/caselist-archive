For example, consider the second factor, i.e., "the nature of the sites where apprehension and then detention took place." In applying this factor in Boumediene, Justice Kennedy wrote as follows:<br/>~T~he detainees here are similarly situated to the Eisentrager petitioners in that <br/>AND<br/>they intend to displace all German institutions even during the period of occupation.<br/>As Judge Bates rightly summarizes in Al-Maqaleh II, "In this case, the D.C. Circuit placed great weight on the fact that the United States’s control over the base at Bagram Airfield was less absolute than its control over Guantanamo Bay." Because the Afghan government had more of an interest (and more directly participated) in the detentions at Bagram, the D.C. Circuit held that Boumediene could be distinguished.<br/>The problem with this reasoning is that it elides the critical distinction between Afghanistan’s involvement <br/>AND<br/>eventually be transferred to the Afghan government, if not to other countries."<br/>Even if that logic follows (and I don’t think it does), it’s beside <br/>AND<br/>second Boumediene factor should militate in favor of habeas, not against it.<br/>Flaw ~233: The Centrality of Practical Obstacles (of the Government’s Own Making)<br/>Finally, and driving home the structural significance of the flawed formalistic approach, Judge <br/>AND<br/>argument under the framework laid out by the D.C.

Can China transform its legal system into one that provides a stable framework for business and foreign investment, that addresses the grievances of those left behind by China’s economic miracle, and that curbs corruption and wrongdoing by official actors, without posing challenges to one-party rule? As The People’s Court suggests, the answer is far from clear.<br/>Before assessing the current and possible future trajectory of Chinese legal reforms, it is <br/>AND<br/>also why many in China bristle at western criticism of China’s legal system.<br/>Since 1978, the changes have been remarkable. There were three thousand lawyers in <br/>AND<br/>have spent significant periods studying in the U.S. or Europe.<br/>There were few laws on the books in the late 1970s. &nbsp;China suspended work <br/>AND<br/>adopted three major new pieces of legislation relating to labor and employment law.<br/>Some of the most important changes in the Chinese legal system have been very recent<br/>AND<br/>and procurators were university graduates, double the percentage of the early 1990s.<br/>Civil litigation was virtually irrelevant in China in 1978. Today there are three to <br/>AND<br/>in ways that central Party-state authorities have a difficult time controlling.<br/>Chinese courts also hear approximately 100,000 cases a year against the government through administrative litigation. Plaintiffs in China may not always get a fair hearing of their cases, but individuals nevertheless increasingly voice their grievances in the language of law. Ordinary people have expectations of how the legal system should work.<br/>Chinese courts have also shown willingness to innovate. Thus, for example, Chinese <br/>AND<br/>invalidate legislation. Courts routinely create new legal rules in less controversial areas.<br/>The internet is facilitating court development. Just a few years ago judges had little <br/>AND<br/>to develop within the confines of the current political system than previously realized.<br/>Acknowledging this progress is not intended to deny the many problems and abuses that continue <br/>AND<br/>in the Chinese legal system; cases can be reexamined at any time.<br/>Judges are often evaluated based on whether they get their decisions right in the eyes of their superiors. Yet getting a decision right may mean issuing a decision that satisfies public or official opinion, rather than legal standards.In a system in which the greatest fear of the leadership is instability, the incentives to align with populist views of justice are very strong — sometimes much stronger than the power of law itself.<br/>Control over civil society and activist lawyering has been tightened in recent years, in <br/>AND<br/>we remember where China was thirty (or even fifteen) years ago.<br/>Having a legal system that serves as a forum for resolving individual grievances is in <br/>AND<br/>interests of local officials or powerful people, and as being fundamentally unjust.<br/>China has devoted tremendous resources to legal education. Such efforts have worked — perhaps too well. &nbsp;Widespread legal education has created expectations that the system should protect ordinary people. There is risk, however, that interaction with the formal legal system may increase disillusionment, thus undermining the legitimacy of both law and the Party-state.<br/>Despite the progress in the Chinese legal system since 1978, many of the most <br/>AND<br/>China, even within the confines of overall leadership by the Communist Party.<br/>The problem facing China’s leaders today is that this next step of legal reform, <br/>AND<br/>power. Thus we see new legislation, but not significant institutional reform.<br/>China’s leaders are not ignorant of the risks of failing to reform. The need <br/>AND<br/>to ensure that none of these developments lead to challenges to Party authority.</p><h4 id="HThatcausesTaiwannuclearwar" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>That causes Taiwan nuclear war</span></h4><p>Colby and Denmar, et al 13, Elbridgc A.

The Open Society Foundation found 136 people had gone through the process of "extraordinary rendition" and 54 countries were complicit in it, South Africa among them.<br/>"However, to date, the full scale and scope of foreign government participation—as well as the number of victims—remains unknown, largely because of the extreme secrecy maintained by the United States and its partner governments," Open Society Foundation investigator Amrit Singh wrote in the report.<br/>The official use of rendition to combat terrorism began in June 1995. Former US President Bill Clinton responded to the 1993 terrorist bombing of the World Trade Centre by signing Presidential Decision Directive 39, which authorised rendition for the capture terrorists.<br/>From August 1995 to September 2001, eight suspected terrorists were rendered to American custody<br/>AND<br/>in New York City, where they were held until they stood trial.<br/>The war on terror, however, employs "extraordinary rendition".<br/>Theresa Blackledge, writing in Global <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://opencaselist13.paperlessdebate.com/bin/Cal+Berkeley/Review-http://sirgo.org/sites/default/files/GlobalReview_VolumeOne.pdf  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path excluded from retrieval by the project\%27s Exclusions properties.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://opencaselist13.paperlessdebate.com/bin/Cal+Berkeley/Review-http://sirgo.org/sites/default/files/GlobalReview_VolumeOne.pdf%27" tppabs="http://opencaselist13.paperlessdebate.com/bin/Cal+Berkeley/Review-http://sirgo.org/sites/default/files/GlobalReview_VolumeOne.pdf"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">Review-http://sirgo.org/sites/default/files/GlobalReview_VolumeOne.pdf</span></a></span> in 2011, explains that previously, rendition <br/>AND<br/>, and for the purpose of detaining the individual for intelligence gathering purposes.<br/>"Typically," Blackledge says, "the U.S. renders the individual to a third party nation that is well known for committing human rights abuses, such as Jordan, Syria or Egypt. The third party nation accepts custody of the detainee and employs ’enhanced interrogation’ methods to obtain intelligence."<br/>Bob Baer, an ex-undercover agent who worked for the CIA in the Middle East, put it like this: "If you want a serious interrogation, you send a prisoner to Jordan. If you want them to be tortured you send them to Syria. If you want someone to disappear – never to see them again – you send them to Egypt."<br/>More than one commentator has remarked at the irony of the US now demanding Syrian <br/>AND<br/>, and threatened with electric shocks by the Syrian government," Singh writes.<br/>After ten months in prison, the Canadian government intervened on behalf of Arar, and he was finally freed without being charged with any crimes. In September 2006, a Canadian investigation cleared Arar of all charges. Canada’s Prime Minister apologised for the acts committed by American officials and ordered Arar be paid 249.7 million in restitution.<br/>The Indian author Arundhati Roy, in her book The Ordinary Person’s Guide to Empire, says about this canny exploitation of human rights violators:<br/>"~Former US~ Attorney General John Ashcroft has declared that US freedoms are ’not the grant of any government or document, but … our endowment from God’. So, basically, we’re confronted with a country armed with a mandate from heaven. Perhaps this explains why the U.S. government &nbsp;refuses to judge itself by the same moral standards by which it judges others."<br/>Singh says," "The U.S. government violated domestic and international law, thereby diminishing its moral standing and eroding support for its counterterrorism efforts worldwide as these abuses came to light."<br/>Supporters of extraordinary rendition believe that it has been an effective ploy in efforts to fight terrorism. They point out that the US has successfully repelled a terror attack on American soil since 9/11. But those opposed to the programme point out that the technique of "enhanced interrogation" has had dubious results.<br/>They point out the case of Ibn al Sheikh Al Libi, an Al Qaeda <br/>AND<br/>intelligence in his report when he addressed the United Nations in February 2003.<br/>We all know how that turned out.<br/>Al Libi is said to have later recanted his statements, claiming the false intelligence was extracted under torture and it was provided to halt the interrogations.<br/>High-ranking officials from the Bush administration have escaped responsibility for authorising human rights violations associated with secret detention and extraordinary rendition, and "the impunity that they have enjoyed to date remains a matter of significant concern," Singh says in the report.<br/>But Open Society notes as well that the US is not the only government in <br/>AND<br/>active participation of foreign governments. These governments too must be held accountable."<br/>One such government is our own. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>Of the 136 cases of extraordinary renditions, two involve South Africa. The report notes that South Africa was implicated in the March 2003 extraordinary rendition of Saud Memon, a Pakistani national and suspect in the murder of Wall Street Journal journalist Daniel Pearl, who was beheaded on camera.<br/>"In light of the secrecy associated with the abduction and the lack of any record in South Africa of his deportation or extradition, it appears that South Africa gave US intelligence agencies carte blanche to pursue his abduction and rendition from South Africa," the report said.<br/>"Investigators at Human Rights Watch believed he was held in CIA custody and then transferred to Pakistani intelligence agents.<br/>"He was ultimately released in April 2007 in Pakistan in poor physical health and died within several weeks of his release."<br/>The other case documented in the report is the well-known case of Khalid <br/>AND<br/>transferring Rashid to Pakistani authorities who travelled to South Africa to receive him.<br/>"The South African minister of home affairs claimed that Rashid was arrested and deported because he resided in the country illegally.<br/>"Rashid was flown from South Africa in a Gulfstream II owned by AVE, a company registered in Kyrgyzstan; the charter was arranged by the government of Pakistan."<br/>The report notes that, in 2009, South Africa’s Supreme Court of Appeal found that Rashid’s detention at the Cullinan police station without a warrant, his removal from that facility without a warrant and his deportation to Pakistan were unlawful.<br/>Rashid was said to have been released in December 2007.<br/>The Open Society report explains unequivocally that such practices of extraordinary rendition pervert the tenets of international law. "There can be no doubt that in today’s world, intergovernmental cooperation is necessary for combating terrorism. But such cooperation must be effected in a manner that is consistent with the rule of law," the report says.<br/>And yet in the cloud of secrecy around the extraordinary renditions programme and South Africa’s policy towards it, it is unknown how many other cases of extraordinary renditions occurred on South African soil. Indeed the extent of South Africa’s co-operation with this programme is entirely unknown.<br/>What is clear from the Open Society report is that extraordinary renditions pose a serious threat to basic human rights: life, liberty, and the security of the person. And more worryingly, the report is not entirely confident that the programme was halted by the Obama administration.<br/>Although Obama issued an executive order in 2009 to halt the detention of suspected terrorists <br/>AND<br/>exactly that pledge to the U.S. before torturing Maher Arar.<br/>And as horrific as Arar’s experience was, he is perhaps lucky to have emerged from it alive and been compensated for his difficulties. Others have not been so lucky.<br/>In December 2003, German citizen Khalid al Masri went on vacation to Macedonia and disappeared for five months. Al Masri was captured by CIA agents and rendered to a prison in Afghanistan where he claims he was interrogated, beaten, and placed in solitary confinement.<br/>The CIA’s capture of al Masri was a case of mistaken identity. The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit against the CIA and the Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet on behalf of al Masri. In October 2007, al Masri’s hopes for restitution were flouted when his case was refused by the US Supreme Court on the basis of protecting state secrets.<br/>The practice of outsourcing torture, meanwhile, continues – and few can be certain of its extent.&nbsp;</p><h4 id="HFailuretoapplythewritextraterritoriallyallowsit2013thiserodesinternationallaw2013onlyexternalcourtaccountabilitysolves" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Failure to apply the writ extraterritorially allows it – this erodes international law – only external court accountability solves</span></h4><p>Satterthwaite 6, Margaret Satterthwaite is Assistant Professor of Clinical Law at NYU School of Law and Faculty Director of the Center for Human Rights and Global Research, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/forumy/2006/03/rendered-meaningless-rule-of-law-in-us.php-http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/forumy/2006/03/rendered-meaningless-rule-of-law-in-us.php  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path excluded from retrieval by the project\%27s Exclusions properties.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/forumy/2006/03/rendered-meaningless-rule-of-law-in-us.php-http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/forumy/2006/03/rendered-meaningless-rule-of-law-in-us.php%27" tppabs="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/forumy/2006/03/rendered-meaningless-rule-of-law-in-us.php-http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/forumy/2006/03/rendered-meaningless-rule-of-law-in-us.php"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/forumy/2006/03/rendered-meaningless-rule-of-law-in-us.php-http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/forumy/2006/03/rendered-meaningless-rule-of-law-in-us.php</span></a></span> <br/>Since 9/11, the U.S. government has used the discourse <br/>AND<br/>At that point, the rule of law will have been rendered meaningless.&nbsp;</p><h4 id="HThisdestroystheentireframeworkforinternationaljustice" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>This destroys the entire framework for international justice</span></h4><p>Malinowski 7, Tom Malinowski, Washington Advocacy Director, Human Rights Watch, Washington, DC, Congressional Testimony, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-110shrg40379/html/CHRG-110shrg40379.htm-http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-110shrg40379/html/CHRG-110shrg40379.htm  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path excluded from retrieval by the project\%27s Exclusions properties.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-110shrg40379/html/CHRG-110shrg40379.htm-http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-110shrg40379/html/CHRG-110shrg40379.htm%27" tppabs="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-110shrg40379/html/CHRG-110shrg40379.htm-http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-110shrg40379/html/CHRG-110shrg40379.htm"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-110shrg40379/html/CHRG-110shrg40379.htm-http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-110shrg40379/html/CHRG-110shrg40379.htm</span></a></span><br/>Or, just for the sake of argument, imagine if the President of Russia <br/>AND<br/>from the Geneva Conventions and treaties against torture—begins to fall apart.</p><h4 id="HReversingAlMaqalehsolves2013self-restraintisn2019ttrusted" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Reversing Al Maqaleh solves – self-restraint isn’t trusted</span></h4><p>Ghosh 12, JD at Stanford Law, Boumediene Applied Badly: The Extraterritorial Constitution after Al Maqaleh v.

It is asserted that the post-ontological era of mature and complex international law (IL) provides a sound rationale for normative behaviour and therefore is of paramount relevance to achieving global peace and security. The example of the United States’ intervention in Iraq will be used to demonstrate the salience of this point.<br/>It must first be acknowledged that IL is not always viewed so positively. This is largely due to the perception/reality gap which obscures the fact that military activity is the exception rather than the rule in international affairs.<br/>In reality, most of the time the majority of interactions occur peacefully and efficiently. IL is a key facilitator of such.<br/>Generally speaking a number of factors demonstrate the move towards IL. These include the data collected in UN Treaty archives, the powerful influence of global economic regimes such as the World Trade Organisation, the sociology of the transnational legal process itself, and the growing importance of international institutions and non-government organisations.<br/>Indeed, the USA is itself party to more than 10,000 treaties. Additionally, the scope of IL is increasingly broad, covering things as diverse as arms control, the use of force, drug trafficking, immigration, human rights, environmental problems, trade and finance, and intellectual property.<br/>The USA has been chosen to demonstrate the extreme relevance of IL to the international <br/>AND<br/>International Criminal Court (ICC), and its increasingly unilateral and hegemonic behaviours.<br/>This emerging character appears to be founded on the presumption that a strong state such <br/>AND<br/>of realising. This indicates the paramount relevance of IL to global security.<br/>At the most fundamental level, the decision to go to war in Iraq, demonstrates IL’s importance. This is in part due to the principle of ’stigmatisation’. If you are an actor that is routinely perceived to be breaching IL, norms and standards in pursuit of national self-interest, then it is likely that stigmatisation will be of significant impact. This is because it makes justification and rationalisation necessary by raising issues of legitimacy and identity.<br/>Accordingly, states often go to great lengths to avoid stigmatisation. The USA demonstrates <br/>AND<br/>principle serves to place IL at the very centre of global security relations.<br/>The relevance of IL is also made apparent by the USA’s difficulty in engendering support<br/>AND<br/>winning the peace, depicts the importance of international legitimacy in achieving objectives.<br/>In theory, only the most powerful of states who do not believe they will ever be weak choose to routinely abuse the principles of IL. In a setting where its strength is superior to any other states’ across almost any measure of power, the USA should not be surprised that lesser states cling to the protection and predictability offerred by IL.<br/>The importance of IL in global affairs is also demonstrated by the USA’s ability (<br/>AND<br/>and their fear that contracts signed would not carry the force of law.<br/>Similarly, the USA’s refusal to abide by IL has greatly hampered relations and cooperation <br/>AND<br/>the goals which even its supreme power is incapable of bringing within grasp.</p><h4 id="HOtherwiseextinctionisinevitable" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Otherwise extinction is inevitable</span></h4><p>Weeramantry 5, Judge, International Law and Peace: A Peace Lesson, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://lcnp.org/global/Law_and_Peace.pdf-http://lcnp.org/global/Law_and_Peace.pdf  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path excluded from retrieval by the project\%27s Exclusions properties.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://lcnp.org/global/Law_and_Peace.pdf-http://lcnp.org/global/Law_and_Peace.pdf%27" tppabs="http://lcnp.org/global/Law_and_Peace.pdf-http://lcnp.org/global/Law_and_Peace.pdf"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://lcnp.org/global/Law_and_Peace.pdf-http://lcnp.org/global/Law_and_Peace.pdf</span></a></span><br/>International law is an essential tool for the abolition of war.

For one thing, the time frame for response to a cyber attack might be much narrower. A nuclear weapon delivered by a land-based ICBM could take 30 minutes to reach its target. An electronic attack would arrive instantaneously, and leave no time to consult with or even inform anyone outside the executive branch before launching a counterstrike, if that were U.S. policy.</p><h4 id="HThemereperceptionofPresidentialcontrolofOCOsfuelsforeignuncertaintythatcausesextinction" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>The mere perception of Presidential control of OCOs fuels foreign uncertainty that causes extinction</span></h4><p>Rothschild 2/13, Editor of Progressive Magazine, Matthew Rothschild is the editor of The Progressive magazine, which is one of the leading voices for peace and social justice in this country.

"Countries or individuals that engage in cyber attacks should face consequences and international condemnation," she warned, alluding to the China-Google kerfuffle. We should "create norms of behavior among states and encourage respect for the global networked commons."<br/>Perhaps so. But the problem with Clinton’s call for accountability and norms on the global network — a call frequently heard in policy discussions about cybersecurity — is the enormous array of cyberattacks originating from the United States. Until we acknowledge these attacks and signal how we might control them, we cannot make progress on preventing cyberattacks emanating from other countries.<br/>An important weapon in the cyberattack arsenal is a botnet, a cluster of thousands and sometimes millions of compromised computers under the ultimate remote control of a "master." Botnets were behind last summer’s attack on South Korean and American government Web sites, as well as prominent attacks a few years ago on Estonian and Georgian sites. They are also engines of spam that can deliver destructive malware that enables economic espionage or theft.<br/>The United States has the most, or nearly the most, infected botnet computers and is thus the country from which a good chunk of botnet attacks stem. The government could crack down on botnets, but doing so would raise the cost of software or Internet access and would be controversial. So it has not acted, and the number of dangerous botnet attacks from America grows.<br/>The United States is also a leading source of "hacktivists" who use digital tools to fight oppressive regimes. Scores of individuals and groups in the United States design or employ computer payloads to attack government Web sites, computer systems and censoring tools in Iran and China. These efforts are often supported by U.S. foundations and universities, and by the federal government. Clinton boasted about this support seven paragraphs after complaining about cyberattacks.<br/>Finally, the U.S. government has perhaps the world’s most powerful and <br/>AND<br/>Bob Gourley, the former chief technology officer for the Defense Intelligence Agency.<br/>These warriors are now under the command of Lt. Gen. Keith Alexander, <br/>AND<br/>S. offensive cyber capabilities, it nominated Alexander to be in charge.<br/>Simply put, the United States is in a big way doing the very things that Clinton criticized. We are not, like the Chinese, stealing intellectual property from U.S. firms or breaking into the accounts of democracy advocates. But we are aggressively using the same or similar computer techniques for ends we deem worthy.<br/>Our potent offensive cyber operations matter for reasons beyond the hypocrisy inherent in undifferentiated condemnation <br/>AND<br/>would "want to go and take down the source of those attacks."<br/>Our adversaries are aware of our prodigious and growing offensive cyber capacities and exploits. <br/>AND<br/>arms race in an arena where the offense already has a natural advantage.</p><p><strong>====It’s reverse causal — lack of norms guarantee escalatory conflict — the U.S. is key====</strong><br/><strong>Lewis 11, Senior Fellow at CSIS&nbsp;</strong>(James Andrew, Confidence-building and international agreement in cybersecurity, citizenlab.org/cybernorms2012/Lewis2011.pdf)<br/>Alternatives to a formal cyber treaty began to appear as early as 2008.

It covers China’s security and military strategies; developments in its military doctrine, force structure and advanced technologies; the security situation in the Taiwan strait; U.S.-China military-to-military contacts and the U.S. strategy for such engagement; and the nature of China’s cyber activities directed against the Defense Department.<br/>David F. Helvey, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for East Asia, briefed Pentagon reporters on the report. He noted that the report, which DoD coordinates with other agencies, "reflects broadly the views held across the United States government." The report is factual and not speculative, he noted.<br/>Helvey said the trends in this year’s report show "a good deal of continuity in terms of the modernization priorities (of China)," despite the 2012 and 2013 turnover to new leadership in that Communist country.<br/>The document notes that China has launched its first aircraft carrier in 2012 and has been sustaining investments in advanced short- and medium-range conventional ballistic missiles, land-attack and anti-ship cruise missiles, counter-space weapons and military cyberspace systems.<br/>"The issue here is not one particular weapons system. It’s the integration and overlapping nature of these weapons systems into a regime that can potentially impede or restrict free military operations in the Western Pacific. So that’s something that we monitor and are concerned about," Helvey said.<br/>The report provided a lot of information, but also raises some questions. "What concerns me is the extent to which China’s military modernization occurs in the absence of the kind of openness and transparency that others are certainly asking of China," he added.<br/>That lack of transparency has effects on the security calculations of others in the region, "and that’s of greater concern," he noted.<br/>Addressing China’s cyber capabilities, Helvey said "in 2012, numerous computer systems around the world, including those owned by the United States government, continued to be targeted for intrusions, some of which appear to be attributable directly to ~Chinese~ government and military organizations."<br/>The report noted that China has "increased assertiveness with respect to its maritime territorial claims" over the past year. China disputes sovereignty with Japan over islands in the East China Sea, and has other territorial disputes with regional neighbors in the South China Sea.</p><h4 id="HPLAdoctrineprovesChineseaggressionagainstTaiwanandtheSouthChinaSeaareinevitable2014A2ADisthelinchpinofthiscapability" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>PLA doctrine proves Chinese aggression against Taiwan and the South China Sea are inevitable — A2AD is the linchpin of this capability</span></h4><p>Yoshihara 10 (Dr. Toshi Yoshihara, Associate Professor in the Strategy and Policy Department at the Naval War College, former Visiting Professor at the U.S. Air War College, Ph.D. International Relations, The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, Tufts University, M.A. International Relations, School of Advanced International Studies, Johns Hopkins University, B.S.

A decade ago, most observers rated Beijing’s ballistic missiles as inaccurate, blunt weapons limited to terrorizing civilian populations. Today, the emerging consensus within the U.S. strategic community is that China’s arsenal can inflict lethal harm with precision on a wide range of military targets, including ports and airfields. As a consequence, many observers have jettisoned previously sanguine net assessments that conferred decisive, qualitative advantages to Taiwan in the cross-strait military balance. Indeed, the debates on China’s coercive power and Taiwan’s apparent inability to resist such pressure have taken on a palpably fatalistic tone. A 2009 RAND monograph warns that China’s large, modern missile and air forces are likely to pose a virtually insurmountable challenge to Taiwanese and American efforts to command the air over the strait and the island. The authors of the report believe that massive ballistic-missile salvos launched against Taiwan’s air bases would severely hamper Taipei’s ability to generate enough fighter sorties to contest air superiority. They state: "As China’s ability to deliver accurate fire across the strait grows, it is becoming increasingly difficult and soon may be impossible for the United States and Taiwan to protect the island’s military and civilian infrastructures from serious damage."1 As a result, the authors observe, "China’s ability to suppress Taiwan and local U.S. air bases with ballistic and cruise missiles seriously threatens the defense’s ability to maintain control of the air over the strait."2 They further assert, "The United States can no longer be confident of winning the battle for the air in the air. This represents a dramatic change from the first five-plus decades of the China- Taiwan confrontation."3 An unclassified Defense Intelligence Agency report assessing the state of Taiwan’s air defenses raises similar concerns. The study notes that Taiwanese fighter aircraft would be unable to take to the air in the absence of well-protected airfield runways, suggesting a major vulnerability to the island’s airpower. The agency further maintains that Taiwan’s capacity to endure missile attacks on runways and to repair them rapidly will determine the integrity of the island’s air-defense system.4 While the report withholds judgment on whether Taipei can maintain air superiority following Chinese missile strikes in a conflict scenario, a key constituent of the U.S. intelligence community clearly recognizes a growing danger to Taiwan’s defense. China’s missiles also threaten Taiwan’s ability to defend itself at sea. William Murray contends that China could sink or severely damage many of Taiwan’s warships docked at naval piers with salvos of ballistic missiles. He argues that "the Second Artillery’s ~China’s strategic missile command’s~ expanding inventory of increasingly accurate ~short-range ballistic missiles~ probably allows Beijing to incapacitate much of Taiwan’s navy and to ground or destroy large portions of the air force in a surprise missile assault and follow-on barrages."5 These are stark, sobering conclusions. Equally troubling is growing evidence that China has turned its attention to Japan, home to some of the largest naval and air bases in the world. Beijing has long worried about Tokyo’s potential role in a cross-strait conflagration. In particular, Chinese analysts chafe at the apparent American freedom to use the Japanese archipelago as a springboard to intervene in a Taiwan contingency. In the past, China kept silent on what the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) would do in response to Japanese logistical support of U.S. military operations. Recent PLA publications, in contrast, suggest that the logic of missile coercion against Taiwan could be readily applied to U.S. forward presence in Japan. The writings convey a high degree of confidence that China’s missile forces could compel Tokyo to limit American use of naval bases while selectively destroying key facilities on those bases. These doctrinal developments demand close attention from Washington and Tokyo, lest the transpacific alliance be caught flat-footed in a future crisis with Beijing. This article is a first step toward better understanding how the Chinese evaluate the efficacy of &nbsp;missile coercion against American military targets in Japan. This article focuses narrowly on Chinese assessments of U.S. naval bases in Japan, excluding the literature on such other key locations as the Kadena and Misawa air bases. The writings on the American naval presence are abundant and far more extensive than studies on the land and air components of U.S. basing arrangements. The dispatch of two carrier battle groups to Taiwan’s vicinity during the 1996 cross-strait crisis stimulated Beijing’s reevaluation of its military strategy toward the island. Not surprisingly, the Chinese are obsessed with the U.S. aircraft carrier, including the facilities and bases that support its operations. It is against this rich milieu that this study explores how the Chinese conceive their missile strategy to complicate American use of military bases along the Japanese archipelago. This article first explores the reasons behind Beijing’s interest in regional bases and surveys the Chinese literature on the U.S. naval presence in Japan to illustrate the amount of attention being devoted to the structure of American military power in Asia. Chinese analysts see U.S. dependence on a few locations for power projection as a major vulnerability. Second, it turns to Chinese doctrinal publications, which furnish astonishing details as to how the PLA might employ ballistic missiles to complicate or deny U.S. use of Japanese port facilities. Chinese defense planners place substantial faith in the coercive value of missile tactics. Third, the article assesses China’s conventional theater ballistic missiles that would be employed against U.S. regional bases. Fourth, it critiques the Chinese writings, highlighting some faulty assumptions about the anticipated effects of missile coercion. Finally, the study identifies some key operational dilemmas that the U.S.-Japanese alliance would likely encounter in a PLA missile campaign. EXPLAINING CHINA’S INTEREST IN REGIONAL BASES Taiwan remains the animating force behind China’s strategic calculus with respect to regional bases in Asia. Beijing’s inability to respond to the display of U.S. naval power at the height of the 1996 Taiwan Strait crisis proved highly embarrassing. There is evidence that the PLA had difficulty in monitoring the movement of the two carrier battle groups, much less in offering its civilian leaders credible military options in response to the carrier presence. This galling experience steeled Beijing’s resolve to preclude U.S. naval deployments near Taiwan in a future crisis. Notably, the Yokosuka-based USS Independence (CV 62) was the first carrier to arrive at the scene in March 1996, cementing Chinese expectations that Washington would dispatch a carrier from Japan in a contingency over Taiwan. Beyond Taiwan, other territorial disputes along China’s nautical periphery could involve U.S. naval intervention. A military crisis arising from conflicting Sino-Japanese claims over the Senkaku (Diaoyu) islands northwest of Taiwan could compel an American reaction. While doubts linger in some Japanese policy circles as to whether foreign aggression against the islands would trigger Washington’s defense commitments as stipulated by the U.S.-Japanese security treaty, joint allied exercises and war games since 2006 suggest that the U.S. military is closely watching events in the East China Sea. Farther south, Chinese territorial claims over large swaths of the South China Sea could also be sources of regional tensions. If a local tussle there escalated into a larger conflagration that threatened international shipping, the U.S. Navy might be ordered to maintain freedom of navigation. In both scenarios, the U.S. carrier based in Japan and other strike groups operating near Asian waters would be called upon as first responders. Concrete territorial disputes that have roiled Asian stability are not the only reasons that American naval power would sortie from regional bases to the detriment of Chinese interests. More abstract and esoteric dynamics may be at work. For example, Chinese leaders fret about the so-called Malacca dilemma. China’s heavy dependence on seaborne energy supplies that transit the Malacca Strait has set off Chinese speculation that the United States might seek to blockade that maritime choke point to coerce Beijing.6 This insecurity stems less from judgments about the possibility or feasibility of such a naval blockade than from the belief that a great power like China should not entrust its energy security to the fickle goodwill of the United States. If the U.S. Navy were ever called upon to fulfill an undertaking of such magnitude, forward basing in Asia would undoubtedly play a pivotal role in sustaining what could deteriorate into a protracted blockade operation. Chinese analysts have also expressed a broader dissatisfaction with America’s self-appointed role as the guardian of the seas. Sea-power advocates have vigorously pushed for a more expansive view of China’s prerogatives along the maritime periphery of the mainland. They bristle at the U.S. Navy’s apparent presumption of the right to command any parcel of the ocean on earth, including areas that China considers its own nautical preserves. Some take issue with the 2007 U.S. maritime strategy, a policy document that baldly states, "We will be able to impose local sea control wherever necessary, ideally in concert with friends and allies, but by ourselves if we must."7 Lu Rude, a former professor at Dalian Naval Academy, cites this passage as evidence of U.S. "hegemonic thinking." He concludes, "Clearly, what is behind ’cooperation’ is America’s interests, having ’partners or the participation of allies’ likewise serves America’s global interests."8 Some Chinese, then, object to the very purpose of U.S. sea power in Asia, which relies on a constellation of regional bases for its effects to be felt (see map). Long-standing regional flash points and domestic expectations of a more assertive China as it goes to sea suggest that Beijing’s grudging acceptance of U.S. forward presence could be eroding even more quickly than once thought. Against this backdrop of increasing Chinese ambivalence toward American naval power, U.S. basing arrangements in Japan have come into sharper focus. CHINESE VIEWS OF U.S. NAVAL BASES IN JAPAN Some Chinese strategists appraise Washington’s military posture in the Asia-Pacific region in stark geopolitical terms. Applying the "defense perimeter of the Pacific" logic elaborated by Secretary of State Dean Acheson in the early Cold War, they see their na - tion enclosed by concentric, layered "island chains." The United States and its allies, they argue, can encircle China or blockade the Chinese mainland from island strongholds, where powerful naval expeditionary forces are based. Analysts who take such a view conceive of the island chains in various ways. Yu Yang and Qi Xiaodong, for example, describe U.S. basing architecture in Asia as a "three line configuration ~...~."9 The first line stretches in a sweeping arc from Japan and South Korea to Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean, forming a "zone of forward bases~...~." This broad notion that the U.S. presence in the western Pacific and the Indian Ocean constitutes a seamless, interlocking set of bases is widely shared in Chinese strategic circles.10 The second line connects Guam and Australia. The last line of bases runs north from Hawaii through Midway to the Aleutians, terminating at Alaska. While these island chains may bear little resemblance to actual U.S. thinking and planning, that the Chinese pay such attention to the geographic structure of American power in Asia is quite notable. These observers discern a cluster of mutually supporting bases, ports, and access points along these island chains. Among the networks of bases in the western Pacific, those located on the Japanese archipelago-the northern anchor of the first island chain-stand out, for the Chinese. Modern Navy, a monthly journal published by the Political Department of the People’s Liberation Army Navy, produced a seven-part series on Japan’s Maritime Self-Defense Force in 2004 and 2005. Notably, it devoted an entire article to Japan’s main naval bases, including Yokosuka, Sasebo, Kure, and Maizuru.11 The depth of the coverage of these bases is rather remarkable, especially when compared to the sparse reporting on similar topics in the United States and in Japan. Perhaps no other place captures the Chinese imagination as much as Yokosuka, which analysts portray as the centerpiece of U.S. basing in Asia.12 One analysis depicts a "Northeast Asian base group ~...~" radiating outward from Yokosuka to Sasebo, Pusan, and Chinhae.13 Writers provide a wide range of details about the Yokosuka naval base, including its precise location, the surrounding geography, the number of piers (particularly those suitable for aircraft carriers), the types and number of maintenance facilities, and the storage capacity of munitions, fuel, and other supply depots.14 Wu Jian, for instance, finds the geographic features of Yokosuka comparable to those of Dalian, a major base of the Chinese navy’s North Sea Fleet.15 Beyond physical similarities, Yokosuka evokes unpleasant memories for the Chinese. One commentator recalls the U.S. transfer of 203 mm heavy artillery from Yokosuka to Nationalist forces on Jinmen during the 1958 Taiwan Strait crisis.16 Tracking more recent events, another observer notes that the Kitty Hawk Strike Group’s deployments from Yokosuka to waters near Taiwan invariably coincided with the presidential elections on the island, in 2000, 2004, and 2008.17 As Pei Huai opines, "Yokosuka has all along irritated the nerves of the Chinese people."18 Moreover, Chinese analysts are keenly aware of Yokosuka’s strategic position. As Du Chaoping asserts: Yokosuka is the U.S. Navy’s main strategic point of concentration and deployment in the Far East and is the ideal American stronghold for employing maritime forces in the Western Pacific and the Indian Ocean regions. A carrier deployed there is akin to the sharpest dagger sheathed in the Western Pacific by the U.S. Navy. It can control the East Asian mainland to the west and it can enter the Indian Ocean to the southwest to secure Malacca, Hormuz, and other important thoroughfares.19 Ma Haiyang concurs: The Yokosuka base controls the three straits of Soya, Tsugaru, Tsushima and the sea and air transit routes in the Indian Ocean. As the key link in the "island chain," it can support ground operations on the Korean Peninsula and naval operations in the Western Pacific. It can support combat in the Middle East and Persian Gulf regions while monitoring and controlling the wide sea areas of the Indian Ocean. Its strategic position is extremely important.20 It is notable that both Du and Ma conceive of Yokosuka as a central hub that tightly links the Pacific and Indian oceans into an integrated theater of operations. Intriguingly, some Chinese commentators view Yokosuka as the front line of the U.S.-Japanese defense cooperation on missile defense. They worry that Aegis-equipped destroyers armed with ballistic-missile-defense (BMD) systems based in Yokosuka could erode China’s nuclear deterrent. Indeed, analysts see concentrations of sea-based BMD capabilities falling roughly along the three island chains described above. Ren Dexin describes Yokosuka as the first line of defense against ballistic missiles, while Pearl Harbor and San Diego provide additional layers.21 Yokosuka is evocatively portrayed as the "forward battlefield position" (...), the indispensable vanguard for the sea-based BMD architecture.22 For some Chinese, these concentric rings or picket lines of sea power appear tailored specifically to bring down ballistic missiles fired across the Pacific from locations as diverse as the Korean Peninsula, 1mainland China, India, or even Iran.23 Specifically, Aegis ships in Yokosuka, Pearl Harbor, and San Diego would be positioned to shoot down missiles in their boost, midcourse, and terminal phases, respectively.24 Chinese observers pay special attention to Aegis deployments along the first island chain. Some believe that Aegis ships operating in the Yellow, East, and South China seas would be able to monitor the launch of any long-range ballistic missile deployed in China’s interior and perhaps to intercept the vehicle in its boost phase. Dai Yanli warns, "Clearly, if Aegis systems are successfully deployed around China’s periphery, then there is the possibility that China’s ballistic missiles would be destroyed over their launch points."25 Ji Yanli, of the Beijing Aerospace Long March Scientific and Technical Information Institute, concurs: "If such ~seabased BMD~ systems begin deployment in areas such as Japan or Taiwan, the effectiveness of China’s strategic power and theater ballistic-missile capabilities would weaken tremendously, severely threatening national security."26 Somewhat problematically, the authors seemingly assume that Beijing would risk its strategic forces by deploying them closer to shore, and they forecast a far more capable Aegis fleet than is technically possible in the near term. The indispensability of the ship-repair and maintenance facilities at Yokosuka emerges as another common theme in the Chinese literature. Analysts in China often note that Yokosuka is the only base west of Hawaii that possesses the wherewithal to handle major carrier repairs. Some have concluded that Yokosuka is irreplaceable as long as alternative sites for a large repair station remain unavailable. Li Daguang, a professor at China’s National Defense University and a frequent commentator on naval affairs, casts doubt on Guam as a potential candidate, observing that the island lacks the basic infrastructure and economies of scale to service carriers.27 China’s Jianchuan Zhishi (Naval and Merchant Ships) published a translated article from a Japanese military journal, Gunji Kenkyu (Japan Military Review), to illustrate the physical limits of Guam as a permanent home port for carriers.28 Chinese analysts also closely examine Sasebo, the second-largest naval base in Japan. Various commentators call attention to its strategic position near key sea-lanes and its proximity to China.29 As Yu Fan notes, "This base is a large-scale naval base closest to our country. Positioned at the intersection of the Yellow Sea, the East China Sea, and the Sea of Japan, it guards the southern mouth of the Korea Strait. This has very important implications for controlling the nexus of the Yellow Sea, the East China Sea, and the Sea of Japan and for blockading the Korea Strait."30 It is clear, then, that Chinese strategists recognize the importance of U.S. naval bases in Japan for fulfilling a range of regional and extraregional responsibilities. Indeed, some believe that the American strategic position in Asia hinges entirely on ready military access to bases on the Japanese islands. Tian Wu argues that without bases in Japan, U.S. forces would have to fall back to Guam or Hawaii. Tian bluntly asserts: If the U.S. military was ever forced to withdraw from Okinawa and Japan, then it would be compelled to retreat thousands of kilometers to set up defenses on the second island chain. Not only would it lose tremendous strategic defensive depth, but it would also lose the advantageous conditions for conducting littoral operations along the East Asian mainland while losing an important strategic relay station to support operations in the Indian Ocean and the Middle East through the South China Sea.31 This emerging discourse offers several clues about Beijing’s calculus in regard to U.S. naval basing arrangements in Japan. Chinese strategists see these bases as collectively representing both a threat to Chinese interests and a critical vulnerability for the United States. Bases in Japan are the most likely locations from which the United States would sortie sea power in response to a contingency over Taiwan. At the same time, the Chinese are acutely aware of the apparent American dependence on a few bases to project power. Should access to and use of these bases be denied for political or military reasons, they reason, Washington’s regional strategy could quickly unravel. While the commentaries documented above are by no means authoritative in the official sense, they are clearly designed to underscore the strategic value and the precariousness of U.S. forward presence in Japan. U.S. BASES IN JAPAN AND CHINESE MISSILE STRATEGY Authoritative PLA documents correlate with this emerging consensus that U.S. bases on the Japanese home islands merit close attention in strategic and operational terms. Indeed, Chinese doctrinal writings clearly indicate that the American presence in Japan would likely be the subject of attack if the United States were to intervene in a cross-strait conflict. The unprecedented public availability of primary sources in China in recent years has opened a window onto Chinese strategic thought, revealing a genuinely competitive intellectual environment that has substantially advanced Chinese debates on military affairs. This growing literature has also improved the West’s understanding of the PLA. In an effort to maximize this new openness in China, this article draws upon publications closely affiliated with the PLA, including those of the prestigious Academy of Military Science and the National Defense University, that address coercive campaigns against regional bases in Asia.32 Some are widely cited among Western military analysts as authoritative works that reflect current PLA thinking. Some likely enjoy official sanction as doctrinal guidance or educational material for senior military commanders. The authors of the studies are high-ranking PLA officers who are either leading thinkers in strategic affairs and military operations or boast substantial operational and command experience. These works, then, collectively provide a sound starting point for examining how regional bases in Asia might fit into Chinese war planning. Among this literature, The Science of Military Strategy stands out in Western strategic circles as an authoritative PLA publication. The authors, Peng Guangqian and Yao Youzhi, advocate an indirect approach to fighting and prevailing against a superior adversary in "future local wars under high-technology conditions."33 To win, the PLA must seek to avoid or bypass the powerful field forces of the enemy while attacking directly the vulnerable rear echelons and command structures that support frontline units. Using the human body as an evocative metaphor for the adversary, Peng and Yao argue, "As compared with dismembering the enemy’s body step by step, destroying his brain and central nerve system is more meaningful for speeding up the course of the war."34 To them, the brain and the central nervous system of a war machine are those principal directing and coordinating elements without which the fighting forces wither or collapse. The aim, then, is to conduct offensive operations against the primary sources of the enemy’s military power, what the authors term the "operational system." They declare, "After launching the war, we should try our best to fight against the enemy as far away as possible, to lead the war to enemy’s operational base, even to his source of war, and to actively strike all the effective strength forming the enemy’s war system."35 In their view, operational systems that manage command and control and logistics (satellites, bases, etc.), are the primary targets; they relegate tactical platforms that deliver firepower (warships, fighters, etc.) to a secondary status. To illustrate the effects of striking the source of the enemy’s fighting power, Peng and Yao further argue: To shake the stability of enemy’s war system so as to paralyze his war capabilities has already become the core of the contest between the two sides in the modern hightech local war. So, more attention should be paid to striking crushing blows against the enemy’s structure of the operational system . . . especially those vulnerable points which are not easy to be replaced or revived, so as to make the enemy’s operational system seriously unbalanced and lose initiative in uncontrollable disorder.36 The authors are remarkably candid about what constitutes the enemy’s operational system. Particularly relevant to this study is their assertion that the supply system emerges as a primary target: The future operational center of gravity should not be placed on the direct confrontation with the enemy’s assault systems. We should persist in taking the information system and support system as the targets of first choice throughout. . . . In regard to the supply system, we should try our best to strike the enemy on the ground, cut the material flow of his efficacy sources so as to achieve the effect of taking away the firewood from the caldron.37 Destruction of the supply system in effect asphyxiates the adversary. In order to choke off the enemy’s capacity to wage war, Peng and Yao contend, a "large part of the supply systems must be destroyed."38 Their prescriptions for winning local high-tech wars suggest that the horizontal escalation of a conflict to U.S. regional bases in Asia is entirely thinkable. Even more troubling, some Chinese appear to envision the application of substantial firepower to pummel the U.S. forward presence. While The Science of Military Strategy should not be treated as official strategic guidance to the PLA, its conceptions of future conflict with a technologically superior adversary provide a useful framework for thinking about what a Chinese missile campaign against regional bases might entail. There is substantial evidence in Chinese doctrinal writings that PLA defense planners anticipate the possibility of a sizable geographic expansion of the target set, to include U.S. forward presence in East Asia. Although the documents do not explicitly refer to naval bases in Japan, they depict scenarios strongly suggesting that Yokosuka is a primary target. In the hypothetical contingencies posited in these writings, U.S. intervention is a critical premise, if not a given. In particular, Chinese planners expect Washington to order the deployment of carrier strike groups near China’s coast, a prospect that deeply vexes Beijing. It is in this context of a highly stressful (though by no means inconceivable) scenario that U.S. military bases come into play in Chinese operational thinking. For PLA planners, the primary aims are to deter, disrupt, or disable the employment of carriers at the point of origin, namely, the bases from which carriers would sortie. Given the limited capability, range, and survivability of China’s air and sea power, most studies foresee the extensive use of long-range conventional ballistic missiles to achieve key operational objectives against U.S. forward presence. In Intimidation Warfare, Zhao Xijun proposes several novel missile tactics that could be employed to deter the use of naval bases in times of crisis or war.39 Zhao proposes demonstration shots into sea areas near the enemy state to compel the opponent to back down. Zhao explains, "Close-in (near border) intimidation strikes involve firing ballistic missiles near enemy vessels or enemy states (or in areas and sea areas of enemy-occupied islands). It is a method designed to induce the enemy to feel that it would suffer an unbearable setback if it stubbornly pursues an objective, and thus abandons certain actions."40 One tactic that Zhao calls a "pincer, close-in intimidation strike" is particularly relevant to missile options against U.S. military bases. Zhao elaborates: "Pincer close-in intimidation strikes entail the firing of ballistic missiles into the sea areas (or land areas) near at least two important targets on enemy-occupied islands (or in enemy states). This enveloping attack, striking the enemy’s head and tail such that the enemy’s attention is pulled in both directions, would generate tremendous psychological shock."41 Zhao also proposes an "island over-flight attack" as a variation of the pincer strike. He states: For high-intensity intimidation against an entrenched enemy on an island, an island over-flight attack employs conventional ballistic missiles with longer range and superior penetration capabilities to pass over the enemy’s important cities and other strategic targets to induce the enemy to sense psychologically that a calamity will descend from the sky. This method could produce unexpected effects.42 While these missile tactics are primarily aimed at coercing Taiwan, they could also, in theory, be applied to any island nation. Reminiscent of the 1996 crossstrait crisis, the PLA could splash single or multiple ballistic missiles into waters near Yokosuka (shot across Honshu Island, over major metropolitan cities) in the hopes that an intimidated leadership in Tokyo would stay out of a contingency over Taiwan, deny American access to military facilities, or restrict U.S. use of naval bases in Japan. Should deterrence through intimidation fail, the Chinese may seek to complicate U.S. naval operations originating from bases located in the Japanese home islands. The Science of Second Artillery Campaigns, the most authoritative work on the PLA’s strategic rocket forces, furnishes astonishingly vivid details on the conditions under which China might seek to conduct conventional missile operations against outside intervention.43&nbsp;</p><h4 id="HTaiwancrisisisimminentandcausesnuclearwar2014it2019sthemostprobable" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Taiwan crisis is imminent and causes nuclear war — it’s the most probable</span></h4><p>Colby and Denmar, et al 13, Elbridgc A.

It is ahead of all others, and has mobilized massive non-military assets and private contractors in that effort. This constellation of private sector opportunity and deliberate government policy has been aptly labeled in recent months and years by so many credible observers (in The Economist, The Financial Times and the MIT Technology Review) as the cyber industrial complex.<br/>The United States is now in the unusual situation where the head of a spy <br/>AND<br/>effects now visible in public. But there are others, less visible.<br/>The NSA Prism program exists because it is technologically possible and there have been no <br/>AND<br/>) pre-existing agreements that constrain nuclear weapons deployment and possible use.<br/>The cyber superiority of the United States, while legal and understandable, is now <br/>AND<br/>, a direct response to particular systems that the other side was building.<br/>In 1969, the USSR acted first to propose an end to the race for the technological frontier of nuclear weapons because it knew it was losing the contest and because it knew there was political sentiment in the United States and in its Allied countries that supported limitations on the unbridled nuclear fetish.<br/>As we ponder the American cyber industrial complex of today, we see a similar constellation of opposition to its power emerging. This constellation includes not just the political rivals who see they are losing in cyber space (China and Russia), but nervous allies who see themselves as the likely biggest victims of the American race for cyber superiority, and loyal American military commanders who can see the risks and dangers of that quest.<br/>It is time for the United States to take stock of the collateral damage that <br/>AND<br/>internationalist persuasion and solidarity for the United States now feel a little betrayed.<br/>Yet, in the long run, the most influential voice to end the American <br/>AND<br/>innovations in cyber attack capability.

"Countries or individuals that engage in cyber attacks should face consequences and international condemnation," she warned, alluding to the China-Google kerfuffle. We should "create norms of behavior among states and encourage respect for the global networked commons."<br/>Perhaps so. But the problem with Clinton’s call for accountability and norms on the global network — a call frequently heard in policy discussions about cybersecurity — is the enormous array of cyberattacks originating from the United States. Until we acknowledge these attacks and signal how we might control them, we cannot make progress on preventing cyberattacks emanating from other countries.<br/>An important weapon in the cyberattack arsenal is a botnet, a cluster of thousands and sometimes millions of compromised computers under the ultimate remote control of a "master." Botnets were behind last summer’s attack on South Korean and American government Web sites, as well as prominent attacks a few years ago on Estonian and Georgian sites. They are also engines of spam that can deliver destructive malware that enables economic espionage or theft.<br/>The United States has the most, or nearly the most, infected botnet computers and is thus the country from which a good chunk of botnet attacks stem. The government could crack down on botnets, but doing so would raise the cost of software or Internet access and would be controversial. So it has not acted, and the number of dangerous botnet attacks from America grows.<br/>The United States is also a leading source of "hacktivists" who use digital tools to fight oppressive regimes. Scores of individuals and groups in the United States design or employ computer payloads to attack government Web sites, computer systems and censoring tools in Iran and China. These efforts are often supported by U.S. foundations and universities, and by the federal government. Clinton boasted about this support seven paragraphs after complaining about cyberattacks.<br/>Finally, the U.S. government has perhaps the world’s most powerful and <br/>AND<br/>Bob Gourley, the former chief technology officer for the Defense Intelligence Agency.<br/>These warriors are now under the command of Lt. Gen. Keith Alexander, <br/>AND<br/>S. offensive cyber capabilities, it nominated Alexander to be in charge.<br/>Simply put, the United States is in a big way doing the very things that Clinton criticized. We are not, like the Chinese, stealing intellectual property from U.S. firms or breaking into the accounts of democracy advocates. But we are aggressively using the same or similar computer techniques for ends we deem worthy.<br/>Our potent offensive cyber operations matter for reasons beyond the hypocrisy inherent in undifferentiated condemnation <br/>AND<br/>would "want to go and take down the source of those attacks."<br/>Our adversaries are aware of our prodigious and growing offensive cyber capacities and exploits. <br/>AND<br/>arms race in an arena where the offense already has a natural advantage.</p><h4 id="HThisiscrucialforTRANSPARENCYtoemerge2014publicknowledgeanddebatebecomesimpossibleandabsenttheaffthestatusquoisaslipperyslopetowardsunfetteredexecutivecontrol" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>This is crucial for TRANSPARENCY to emerge — public knowledge and debate becomes impossible and absent the aff the status quo is a slippery slope towards unfettered executive control</span></h4><p><strong>Harman 13</strong>, Director of the Wilson Center <br/>(Jane, The Extrajudicial Use of Drones: The Need for a Post-9/11 Legal Framework, www.wilsoncenter.org/article/the-extrajudicial-use-drones-the-need-for-post-911-legal-framework)<br/>As threats, technologies, and tactics have evolved, the law has not kept <br/>AND<br/>threat to the US or its citizens.

Second, by allowing Congress to author the details, often times the parochial concerns of members can be accommodated with little contention. Finally, if Congress debates the merits of a plan and votes to support it, the members are more likely to fund its implementation. &nbsp;~*231~ <br/>Links to politics<br/>Hallowell 13 writer for The Blaze, Here’s How Obama is Using Executive Power to Bypass Legislative Process, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/02/11/heres-how-obamas-using-executive-power-to-bylass-legislative-process-plus-a-brief-history-of-executive-orders/-http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/02/11/heres-how-obamas-using-executive-power-to-bylass-legislative-process-plus-a-brief-history-of-executive-orders/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path excluded from retrieval by the project\%27s Exclusions properties.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/02/11/heres-how-obamas-using-executive-power-to-bylass-legislative-process-plus-a-brief-history-of-executive-orders/-http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/02/11/heres-how-obamas-using-executive-power-to-bylass-legislative-process-plus-a-brief-history-of-executive-orders/%27" tppabs="http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/02/11/heres-how-obamas-using-executive-power-to-bylass-legislative-process-plus-a-brief-history-of-executive-orders/-http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/02/11/heres-how-obamas-using-executive-power-to-bylass-legislative-process-plus-a-brief-history-of-executive-orders/"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/02/11/heres-how-obamas-using-executive-power-to-bylass-legislative-process-plus-a-brief-history-of-executive-orders/-http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/02/11/heres-how-obamas-using-executive-power-to-bylass-legislative-process-plus-a-brief-history-of-executive-orders/</span></a></span><br/>and#34;In an era of polarized parties and a fragmented Congress, the opportunities to <br/>AND<br/>a partisan content, with contemporary complaints coming from the incumbent president’s opponents.and#34;</p><h4 id="HThedefensivecyberplanklinkstopolitics" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>The defensive cyber plank links to politics</span></h4><p><strong>Sasso 12</strong> (Brandon Sasso, December 21, 2012, and#34;House Republicans urge Obama not to issue cybersecurity order,and#34; The Hill, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/technology/274391-house-republicans-urge-obama-not-to-issue-cybersecurity-order)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/technology/274391-house-republicans-urge-obama-not-to-issue-cybersecurity-order)%27" tppabs="http://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/technology/274391-house-republicans-urge-obama-not-to-issue-cybersecurity-order)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/technology/274391-house-republicans-urge-obama-not-to-issue-cybersecurity-order)</span></a></span><br/>A group of 46 House Republicans, led by Reps.

A. Individual Nations Have Accepted and Are Seeking to Implement Judicial Review By A Strong, Independent Judiciary. Many of the newly independent governments that have proliferated over the past five decades have adopted these ideals. They have emerged from a variety of less-than-free contexts, including the end of European colonial rule in the 1950’s and 1960’s, the end of the Cold War and the breakup of the former Soviet Union in the late 1980’s and 1990’s, the disintegration of Yugoslavia, and the continuing turmoil in parts of Africa, Latin America and southern Asia. Some countries have successfully transitioned to stable and democratic forms of government that protect individual freedoms and human rights by means of judicial review by a strong and independent judiciary. Others have suffered the rise of tyrannical and oppressive rulers who consolidated their hold on power in part by diminishing or abolishing the role of the judiciary. And still others hang in the balance, struggling against the onslaught of tyrants to establish stable, democratic governments. In their attempts to shed their tyrannical pasts and to ensure the protection of individual rights, emerging democracies have consistently looked to the United States and its Constitution in fashioning frameworks that safeguard the independence of their judiciaries. See Ran Hirschl, The Political Origins of Judicial Empowerment through Constitutionalization: Lessons from Four Constitutional Revolutions, 25 Law 26 Soc. Inquiry 91, 92 (2000) (stating that of the "~m~any countries . . . ~that~ have engaged in fundamental constitutional reform over the past three decades," nearly all adopted "a bill of rights and establishe~d~ some form of active judicial review") Establishing judicial review by a strong and independent judiciary is a critical step in stabilizing and protecting these new democracies.

Although the precise form of government differs among countries, "they ultimately constitute variations within, not from, the American model of constitutionalism . . . ~a~ specific set of fundamental rights and liberties has the status of supreme law, is entrenched against amendment or repeal . . . and is enforced by an independent court . . . ." Stephen Gardbaum, The New Commonwealth Model of Constitutionalism, 49 Am. J. Comp. L. 707, 718 (2001). This phenomenon became most notable worldwide after World War II when certain countries, such as Germany, Italy, and Japan, embraced independent judiciaries following their bitter experiences under totalitarian regimes. See id. at 714- 15; see also United States v. Then, 56 F.3d 464, 469 (2d Cir. 1995) (Calabresi, J., concurring) ("Since World War II, many countries have adopted forms of judicial review, which — though different from ours in many particulars — unmistakably draw their origin and inspiration from American constitutional theory and practice. See generally Mauro Cappelletti, The Judicial Process in Comparative Perspective (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1989)."). It is a trend that continues to this day. It bears mention that the United States has consistently affirmed and encouraged the establishment of independent judiciaries in emerging democracies. In September 2000, President Clinton observed that "~w~ithout the rule of law, elections simply offer a choice of dictators. . . .

The United States acts on these principles in part through the assistance it provides to developing nations. For example, the United States requires that any country seeking assistance through the Millenium Challenge Account, a development assistance program instituted in 2002, must demonstrate, among other criteria, an "adherence to the rule of law." The White House noted that the rule of law is one of the "essential conditions for successful development" of these countries.

On November 28, 1998, Albania adopted a new constitution, representing the culmination of eight years of democratic reform after the communist rule collapsed.

B. Other Nations Have Curtailed Judicial Review During Times Of Crisis, Often Citing the United States’ Example, And Individual Freedoms Have Diminished As A Result. While much of the world is moving to adopt the institutions necessary to secure individual rights, many still regularly abuse these rights. One of the hallmarks of tyranny is the lack of a strong and independent judiciary. Not surprisingly, where countries make the sad transition to tyranny, one of the first victims is the judiciary. Many of the rulers that go down that road justify their actions on the basis of national security and the fight against terrorism, and, disturbingly, many claim to be modeling their actions on the United States. Again, a few examples illustrate this trend. In Peru, one of former President Alberto Fujimori’s first acts in seizing control was to assume direct executive control of the judiciary, claiming that it was justified by the threat of domestic terrorism. He then imprisoned thousands, refusing the right of the judiciary to intervene.

While Peru and Zimbabwe represent an extreme, the independence of the judiciary is under assault in less brazen ways in a variety of countries today. A highly troubling aspect of this trend is the fact that in many of these instances those perpetuating the assaults on the judiciary have pointed to the United States’ model to justify their actions. Indeed, many have specifically referenced the United States’ actions in detaining persons in Guantánamo Bay. For example, Rais Yatim, Malaysia’s "de facto law minister" explicitly relied on the detentions at Guantánamo to justify Malaysia’s detention of more than 70 suspected Islamic militants for over two years. Rais stated that Malyasia’s detentions were "just like the process in Guantánamo," adding, "I put the equation with Guantánamo just to make it graphic to you that this is not simply a Malaysian style of doing things." Sean Yoong, "Malaysia Slams Criticism of Security Law Allowing Detention Without Trial," Associated Press, September 9, 2003 (available from Westlaw at 9/9/03 APWIRES 09:34:00). Similarly, when responding to a United States Government human rights report that listed rights violations in Namibia, Namibia’s Information Permanent Secretary Mocks Shivute cited the Guantánamo Bay detentions, claiming that "the US government was the worst human rights violator in the world." BBC Monitoring, March 8, 2002, available at 2002 WL 15938703. Nor is this disturbing trend limited to these specific examples. At a recent conference held at the Carter Center in Atlanta, President Carter, specifically citing the Guantánamo Bay detentions, noted that the erosion of civil liberties in the United States has "given a blank check to nations who are inclined to violate human rights already." Doug Gross, "Carter: U.S. human rights missteps embolden foreign dictators," Associated Press Newswires, November 12, 2003 (available from Westlaw at 11/12/03 APWIRES 00:30:26). At the same conference, Professor Saad Ibrahim of the American University in Cairo (who was jailed for seven years after exposing fraud in the Egyptian election process) said, "Every dictator in the world is using what the United States has done under the Patriot Act . . . to justify their past violations of human rights and to declare a license to continue to violate human rights." Id. Likewise, Shehu Sani, president of the Kaduna, Nigeriabased Civil Rights Congress, wrote in the International Herald Tribune on September 15, 2003 that "~t~he insistence by the Bush administration on keeping Taliban and Al Quaeda captives in indefinite detention in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, instead of in jails in the United States — and the White House’s preference for military tribunals over regular courts — helps create a free license for tyranny in Africa. It helps justify Egypt’s move to detain human rights campaigners as threats to national security, and does the same for similar measures by the governments of Ivory Coast, Cameroon and Burkina Faso."

In our uni-polar world, the United States obviously sets an important example on these issues. As reflected in the foundational documents of the United Nations and many other such agreements, the international community has consistently affirmed the value of an independent judiciary to the defense of universally recognized human rights. In the crucible of actual practice within nations, many have looked to the United States model when developing independent judiciaries with the ability to check executive power in the defense of individual rights. Yet others have justified abuses by reference to the conduct of the United States. Far more influential than the words of Montesquieu and Madison are the actions of the United States. This case starkly presents the question of which model this Court will set for the world. CONCLUSION Much of the world models itself after this country’s two hundred year old traditions — and still more on its day to day implementation and expression of those traditions. To say that a refusal to exercise jurisdiction in this case will have global implications is not mere rhetoric. Resting on this Court’s decision is not only the necessary role this Court has historically played in this country. Also at stake are the freedoms that many in emerging democracies around the globe seek to ensure for their peoples.&nbsp;</p><h4 id="HDetentioniskey2014indefinitedetentionemboldensglobaldestructionofrightsprotection-1" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Detention is key — indefinite detention emboldens global destruction of rights protection</span></h4><p>Chaffee 9, Advocacy Counsel at Human Rights First, Dismantling Guantanamo: Facing the Challenges of Continued Detention and Repatriation: The Cost of Indefinitely Kicking the Can: Why Continued "Prolonged" Detention Is No Solution To Guantanamo, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/lnacademic/?-http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/lnacademic/?  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path excluded from retrieval by the project\%27s Exclusions properties.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/lnacademic/?-http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/lnacademic/?%27" tppabs="http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/lnacademic/?-http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/lnacademic/?"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/lnacademic/?-http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/lnacademic/?</span></a></span><br/>The Guantanamo detentions have shown that assessments of dangerousness based not on overt acts, as in a criminal trial, but on association are unreliable and will inevitably lead to costly mistakes.

Is Reform Possible? Checks, Smoke, and Mirrors<br/>Madison, as noted at the outset,543 believed that a constitution must not only set up a government that can control and protect the people, but, equally importantly, must protect the people from the government.544 Madison thus anticipated the enduring tradeoff: the lesser the threat from government, the lesser its capacity to protect against threats; the greater the government’s capacity to protect against threats, the greater the threat from the government.<br/>Recognition of the dystopic implications of double government focuses the mind, naturally, on possible legalist cures to the threats that double government presents. Potential remedies fall generally into two categories. First, strengthen systemic checks, either by reviving Madisonian institutions—by tweaking them about the edges to enhance their vitality— or by establishing restraints directly within the Trumanite network. Second, cultivate civic virtue within the electorate.<br/>A. Strengthening Systemic Checks<br/>The first set of potential remedies aspires to tone up Madisonian muscles one by one <br/>AND<br/>?

Understandably, Maddow’s book urges Congress to take a stand against war:<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we go to war, we should raise taxes to pay for it. We should get rid of the secret military. The reserves should go back to being reserves. We should cut way back on the contractors and let troops peel their own potatoes. And above all, Congress should start throwing its weight around again…<br/>I agree in principle, but disagree on practice.

The US defence department had developed tools to trace attackers, he said, and a cyber strike force that could conduct operations via computer networks. The latest leaked documents show that of the 231 offensive operations conducted in 2011, nearly three-quarters were against top-priority targets, which former officials say includes adversaries such as Iran, Russia, China and North Korea. According to a presidential directive issued in October 2012, offensive cyber operations are defined as activities intended to manipulate, disrupt, deny, degrade or destroy information resident in computers or computer networks, or the computers and networks themselves.¶ A cyber war is defined as a conflict that uses hostile, illegal transactions or attacks on computers and networks in an effort to disrupt communications and other pieces of infrastructure as a mechanism to inflict economic harm or upset defenses.&nbsp;</p><p>Cyberattacks affect manipulation of data — that’s distinct from cyber exploitation which merely copies data<br/>Brecher 13, JD Candidate at UMich Law School, Cyberattacks and the Covert Action Statute: Toward a Domestic Legal Framework for Offensive Cyberoperations, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.michiganlawreview.org/assets/pdfs/111/3/Brecher.pdf-http://www.michiganlawreview.org/assets/pdfs/111/3/Brecher.pdf  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path excluded from retrieval by the project\%27s Exclusions properties.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.michiganlawreview.org/assets/pdfs/111/3/Brecher.pdf-http://www.michiganlawreview.org/assets/pdfs/111/3/Brecher.pdf%27" tppabs="http://www.michiganlawreview.org/assets/pdfs/111/3/Brecher.pdf-http://www.michiganlawreview.org/assets/pdfs/111/3/Brecher.pdf"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.michiganlawreview.org/assets/pdfs/111/3/Brecher.pdf-http://www.michiganlawreview.org/assets/pdfs/111/3/Brecher.pdf</span></a></span><br/>The term "cyberattack," as used in this Note, refers to a "deliberate action~~ to alter, disrupt, deceive, degrade, or destroy computer systems or networks or the information ~or~ programs resident in or transiting these systems or networks."7 Key characteristics of cyberattacks include the great difficulty of attributing them definitively to their sources,8 and their potential to cause almost instantaneous effects from anywhere in the world.9 Cyberattacks are frequently confused with cyberexploitation, which as a technical matter is similar. The key difference is that cyberexploitation involves only the monitoring or copying of data, while cyberattacks involve the manipulation of data.10 This Note discusses only the latter¶ <br/>Conflating cyberattack and cyberexploitation creates bad discussion and bad policy – they require totally separate plans and responses &nbsp;<br/>National Research Council – 2009, William A.

It used to be possible to largely separate the Gulf and the Levant. One set of tensions focused on the Arab-Israel conflict versus tensions focused on the Gulf. Iraq stood between them. It sometimes became a crisis on its own but always acted as a strategic buffer between two major subregions in the Middle East.<br/>However, it has become clear over the last year that the upheavals in the Islamic and Arab world have become a clash within a civilization rather than a clash betweencivilizations. The Sunni vs. Alewite civil war in Syria is increasingly interacting with the Sunni versus Shi’ite tensions in the Gulf that are edging Iraq back towards civil war. They also interact with the Sunni-Shi’ite, Maronite, and other confessional struggles in Lebanon.<br/>The "Kurdish problem" now spreads from Syria to Iraq to Turkey to Iran. The question of Arab identity versus Sunni or Shi’ite sectarian identity divides Iraq from the Arab Gulf states and pushes it towards Iran.
