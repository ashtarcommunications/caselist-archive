Trade restrictions have steadily increased to block Iran’s lucrative petroleum export market as well as the country’s participation in the global banking system. All told, international sanctions have cost Iran over 24100 billion in lost oil profits alone.<br/>So called "carrot and stick" policies have long been fundamental to international diplomacy. The "stick" has been a sharp one, and has finally brought the Iranians to the negotiating table.<br/>During his September visit to the UN General Assembly in New York, Iranian President <br/>AND<br/>, all but ensuring that negotiations cannot be used as a delay tactic.<br/>Yet amid these positive signs that diplomacy is working, members of Congress have advocated for even more sanctions to be levied against Iran, specifically in the form of Senate Bill 1881, sponsored by Illinois Republican Mark Kirk and New Jersey Democrat Robert Menendez.<br/>New sanctions would torpedo the Vienna talks and reverse the diplomatic progress that has been made.<br/>Iranian officials have already promised to abandon negotiations if new sanctions are passed. Even our own allies, along with Russia and China, have opposed the move. Passing unilateral sanctions will splinter the fragile international coalition, needlessly antagonize Iranian negotiators, and make a violent conflict with Iran more likely. Diplomatic victory will only be achieved if the international community stands united before Iran.<br/>To this point, the Obama administration has avoided a vote on SB 1881 by threatening a veto of the bill, and the administration’s full court press to prevent Senate Democrats from supporting new sanctions has bought international negotiators time. Several influential Democrats, including Senator Richard Blumenthal from Connecticut, have agreed to postpone a vote on the bill, contingent on productive negotiations.<br/>Although legislation imposing new sanctions has been avoided thus far, the pressure on Congressional Democrats to act will intensify as talks in Vienna move forward. This round of negotiations is widely projected to be more difficult than the November deal, and inflammatory rhetoric from Tehran is likely. Nevertheless, sanctions are not the answer. Instead, we must continue to let diplomacy run its course.<br/>Sanctions have done their job by bringing Iran to the table. In return, Iran expects to be rewarded with sanctions relief. The passage of new trade restrictions would effectively withdraw the carrot, and hit Iran with another stick. Consider the negotiations over.<br/>The risks of delaying new sanctions is slight. The sanctions relief Iran is receiving <br/>AND<br/>to prevent Tehran from racing towards a nuclear weapon while negotiations are ongoing.<br/>At the same time, the benefits of successful diplomacy are immense, as a comprehensive deal would be a dramatic victory for U.S. non-proliferation efforts. Further, the dismantling of Iran’s nuclear program would significantly ease tensions between its two biggest rivals in the region, Israel and Saudi Arabia.<br/>Our congressional leaders must not be so confident as to think Iran is desperate for <br/>AND<br/>policy dominated by isolation from the West and an aggressive nuclear development program.<br/>Our senators are facing significant political pressure to resist multilateralism and pursue increased sanctions based on an uncompromising mistrust of Iran. But history judges leaders not upon their conformity with party politics, but upon the ultimate results they achieve. It’s time to negotiate with the Iranians on good faith, and begin the serious work of establishing a meaningful nuclear agreement that could signal the beginning of a new era in Iranian-Western relations.</p><p><strong>====Plan triggers defection of democratic allies====</strong><br/><strong>Loomis, 7</strong> —- Department of Government at Georgetown <br/>(3/2/2007, Dr. Andrew J.

But it is the legislation’s commitment to support an Israeli preventive strike against Iranian nuclear facilities that almost ensures the U.S. and Iran will come to blows. As Section 2b, part 5 of the draft mandates:<br/>If the Government of Israel is compelled to take military action in legitimate self-defense against Iran’s nuclear weapon program, the United States Government should stand with Israel and provide, in accordance with the law of the United States and the constitutional responsibility of Congress to authorize the use of military force, diplomatic, military, and economic support to the Government of Israel in its defense of its territory, people, and existence.<br/>Now, the legislation being pushed by Senators Mark Kirk (R-IL), <br/>AND<br/>March told a Christians United for Israel (CUFI) conference in July:<br/>"If nothing changes in Iran, come September, October, I will present a resolution that will authorize the use of military force to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear bomb."<br/>Graham would have plenty of company from the hardest of hard liners in his party. In August 2012, Romney national security adviser and pardoned Iran-Contra architect Elliott Abrams called for a war authorization in the pages of the Weekly Standard. And just two weeks ago, Norman Podhoretz used his Wall Street Journal op-ed to urge the Obama administration to "strike Iran now" to avoid "the nuclear war sure to come."<br/>But at the end of the day, the lack of an explicit AUMF in the Nuclear Weapon Free Iran Act doesn’t mean its supporters aren’t giving Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu de facto carte blanche to hit Iranian nuclear facilities. The ensuing Iranian retaliation against to Israeli and American interests would almost certainly trigger the commitment of U.S. forces anyway.<br/>Even if the Israelis alone launched a strike against Iran’s atomic sites, Tehran will almost certainly hit back against U.S. targets in the Straits of Hormuz, in the region, possibly in Europe and even potentially in the American homeland. Israel would face certain retaliation from Hezbollah rockets launched from Lebanon and Hamas missiles raining down from Gaza.<br/>That’s why former Bush Defense Secretary Bob Gates and CIA head Michael Hayden raising the <br/>AND<br/>10 years in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars combined.") The anticipated blowback?<br/>Serious costs to U.S. interests would also be felt over the longer term, we believe, with problematic consequences for global and regional stability, including economic stability. A dynamic of escalation, action, and counteraction could produce serious unintended consequences that would significantly increase all of these costs and lead, potentially, to all-out regional war.</p><h4 id="HIsraelistrikescausegreatpowerwarandcollapseglobaleconomy" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Israeli strikes cause great power war and collapse global economy</span></h4><p>Rafael <strong>Reuveny 10</strong>, PhD, Professor in the School of Public and Environmental Affairs at Indiana University, "Unilateral Strike on Iran could trigger world Depression", Op-ed distributed through McClatchy Newspaper Co, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.indiana.edu/~~spea/news/speaking_out/reuveny_on_unilateral_strike_Iran.shtml  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.indiana.edu/~~spea/news/speaking_out/reuveny_on_unilateral_strike_Iran.shtml%27" tppabs="http://www.indiana.edu/~~spea/news/speaking_out/reuveny_on_unilateral_strike_Iran.shtml"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.indiana.edu/~~spea/news/speaking_out/reuveny_on_unilateral_strike_Iran.shtml</span></a></span><br/>A unilateral Israeli strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities would likely have dire consequences, including <br/>AND<br/>likely protest and send weapons, but would probably not risk using force.<br/>¶ While no one has a crystal ball, leaders should be risk-averse when choosing war as a foreign policy tool.

Trade restrictions have steadily increased to block Iran’s lucrative petroleum export market as well as the country’s participation in the global banking system. All told, international sanctions have cost Iran over 24100 billion in lost oil profits alone.<br/>So called "carrot and stick" policies have long been fundamental to international diplomacy. The "stick" has been a sharp one, and has finally brought the Iranians to the negotiating table.<br/>During his September visit to the UN General Assembly in New York, Iranian President <br/>AND<br/>, all but ensuring that negotiations cannot be used as a delay tactic.<br/>Yet amid these positive signs that diplomacy is working, members of Congress have advocated for even more sanctions to be levied against Iran, specifically in the form of Senate Bill 1881, sponsored by Illinois Republican Mark Kirk and New Jersey Democrat Robert Menendez.<br/>New sanctions would torpedo the Vienna talks and reverse the diplomatic progress that has been made.<br/>Iranian officials have already promised to abandon negotiations if new sanctions are passed. Even our own allies, along with Russia and China, have opposed the move. Passing unilateral sanctions will splinter the fragile international coalition, needlessly antagonize Iranian negotiators, and make a violent conflict with Iran more likely. Diplomatic victory will only be achieved if the international community stands united before Iran.<br/>To this point, the Obama administration has avoided a vote on SB 1881 by threatening a veto of the bill, and the administration’s full court press to prevent Senate Democrats from supporting new sanctions has bought international negotiators time. Several influential Democrats, including Senator Richard Blumenthal from Connecticut, have agreed to postpone a vote on the bill, contingent on productive negotiations.<br/>Although legislation imposing new sanctions has been avoided thus far, the pressure on Congressional Democrats to act will intensify as talks in Vienna move forward. This round of negotiations is widely projected to be more difficult than the November deal, and inflammatory rhetoric from Tehran is likely. Nevertheless, sanctions are not the answer. Instead, we must continue to let diplomacy run its course.<br/>Sanctions have done their job by bringing Iran to the table. In return, Iran expects to be rewarded with sanctions relief. The passage of new trade restrictions would effectively withdraw the carrot, and hit Iran with another stick. Consider the negotiations over.<br/>The risks of delaying new sanctions is slight. The sanctions relief Iran is receiving <br/>AND<br/>to prevent Tehran from racing towards a nuclear weapon while negotiations are ongoing.<br/>At the same time, the benefits of successful diplomacy are immense, as a comprehensive deal would be a dramatic victory for U.S. non-proliferation efforts. Further, the dismantling of Iran’s nuclear program would significantly ease tensions between its two biggest rivals in the region, Israel and Saudi Arabia.<br/>Our congressional leaders must not be so confident as to think Iran is desperate for <br/>AND<br/>policy dominated by isolation from the West and an aggressive nuclear development program.<br/>Our senators are facing significant political pressure to resist multilateralism and pursue increased sanctions based on an uncompromising mistrust of Iran. But history judges leaders not upon their conformity with party politics, but upon the ultimate results they achieve. It’s time to negotiate with the Iranians on good faith, and begin the serious work of establishing a meaningful nuclear agreement that could signal the beginning of a new era in Iranian-Western relations.</p><p><strong>====Plan triggers defection of democratic allies====</strong><br/><strong>Loomis, 7</strong> —- Department of Government at Georgetown <br/>(3/2/2007, Dr. Andrew J.

But it is the legislation’s commitment to support an Israeli preventive strike against Iranian nuclear facilities that almost ensures the U.S. and Iran will come to blows. As Section 2b, part 5 of the draft mandates:<br/>If the Government of Israel is compelled to take military action in legitimate self-defense against Iran’s nuclear weapon program, the United States Government should stand with Israel and provide, in accordance with the law of the United States and the constitutional responsibility of Congress to authorize the use of military force, diplomatic, military, and economic support to the Government of Israel in its defense of its territory, people, and existence.<br/>Now, the legislation being pushed by Senators Mark Kirk (R-IL), <br/>AND<br/>March told a Christians United for Israel (CUFI) conference in July:<br/>"If nothing changes in Iran, come September, October, I will present a resolution that will authorize the use of military force to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear bomb."<br/>Graham would have plenty of company from the hardest of hard liners in his party. In August 2012, Romney national security adviser and pardoned Iran-Contra architect Elliott Abrams called for a war authorization in the pages of the Weekly Standard. And just two weeks ago, Norman Podhoretz used his Wall Street Journal op-ed to urge the Obama administration to "strike Iran now" to avoid "the nuclear war sure to come."<br/>But at the end of the day, the lack of an explicit AUMF in the Nuclear Weapon Free Iran Act doesn’t mean its supporters aren’t giving Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu de facto carte blanche to hit Iranian nuclear facilities. The ensuing Iranian retaliation against to Israeli and American interests would almost certainly trigger the commitment of U.S. forces anyway.<br/>Even if the Israelis alone launched a strike against Iran’s atomic sites, Tehran will almost certainly hit back against U.S. targets in the Straits of Hormuz, in the region, possibly in Europe and even potentially in the American homeland. Israel would face certain retaliation from Hezbollah rockets launched from Lebanon and Hamas missiles raining down from Gaza.<br/>That’s why former Bush Defense Secretary Bob Gates and CIA head Michael Hayden raising the <br/>AND<br/>10 years in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars combined.") The anticipated blowback?<br/>Serious costs to U.S. interests would also be felt over the longer term, we believe, with problematic consequences for global and regional stability, including economic stability. A dynamic of escalation, action, and counteraction could produce serious unintended consequences that would significantly increase all of these costs and lead, potentially, to all-out regional war.</p><h4 id="HIsraelistrikescausegreatpowerwarandcollapseglobaleconomy-1" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Israeli strikes cause great power war and collapse global economy</span></h4><p>Rafael <strong>Reuveny 10</strong>, PhD, Professor in the School of Public and Environmental Affairs at Indiana University, "Unilateral Strike on Iran could trigger world Depression", Op-ed distributed through McClatchy Newspaper Co, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.indiana.edu/~~spea/news/speaking_out/reuveny_on_unilateral_strike_Iran.shtml  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.indiana.edu/~~spea/news/speaking_out/reuveny_on_unilateral_strike_Iran.shtml%27" tppabs="http://www.indiana.edu/~~spea/news/speaking_out/reuveny_on_unilateral_strike_Iran.shtml"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.indiana.edu/~~spea/news/speaking_out/reuveny_on_unilateral_strike_Iran.shtml</span></a></span><br/>A unilateral Israeli strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities would likely have dire consequences, including <br/>AND<br/>likely protest and send weapons, but would probably not risk using force.<br/>¶ While no one has a crystal ball, leaders should be risk-averse when choosing war as a foreign policy tool.

But <br/>AND<br/>Bush years as a springboard for even more extreme assertions of executive authority.<br/>Anything Obama does through executive order can be reversed by the next president through a countervailing executive order. The president’s real challenge is to design a thoughtful process through which he could lead Congress to pass landmark legislation that would decisively repudiate the unilateralism of the Bush years.<br/>The first step is to create a presidential commission on presidential power. Like great <br/>AND<br/>and Congress to enact realistic limitations into law before the next presidential election.<br/>We have been here before. During the 1970s, Congress responded to the abuses <br/>AND<br/>move beyond partisanship and confront the serious problem left to us by history.<br/>We should not look upon presidential lawlessness as if it were an odd aberration of <br/>AND<br/>cures for the systematic tendency of the modern presidency to abuse its powers.<br/>I am not calling for a truth commission that is primarily concerned with establishing the sordid facts about past abuses of power. The commission should be resolutely forward-looking, mining the past only to understand why existing statutes failed to effectively restrain presidential power. The challenge is to learn from experience and design better systems of checks and balances for the future.<br/>This can only be accomplished by creating a special commission in which members of Congress <br/>AND<br/>landmark legislation would serve as one of Obama’s great legacies to future generations.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HExecutiveordersfacilitatethelegislativeprocess" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Executive orders facilitate the legislative process</span></h4><p><strong>Mayer and Price, 02</strong> (Kenneth, Kevin, Professor @ U of Wisconsin-Madison, Graduate Student @ U of Wisconsin-Madison, Presidential Studies Quarterly, "Unilateral presidential powers: significant executive orders", 6/1/2002, lexis)</p><p>If presidents may use the rhetorical, personal, and persuasive resources of the office<br/>AND<br/>the legislative process, codify ideological, commitments, and drive social change.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h3 id="HAt:links" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>At: links</span></h3><h4 id="HCPisnotalossforObama" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>CP is not a loss for Obama</span></h4><p><strong>Balkin, 9/3 —- Professor of Constitutional Law and the First Amendment at Yale</strong> (9/3/2013, Jack M., "What Congressional Approval Won’t Do: Trim Obama’s Power or Make War Legal; Critics think Obama has boxed himself in and surrendered executive-branch power to Congress.

Rev. De Novo 615)&nbsp;</p><p>n17 The phrase "statutory restrictions" is used hereinafter to mean statutory language that restricts the President’s powers of nomination and appointment to those individuals meeting specific criteria. Examples include gender, state of residence, and most importantly political party. n18 Since 1980, more than one hundred Presidential signing statements have specifically mentioned the Appointments Clause.

For numerous examples, see id. See also infra note 175. n20 The phrase "hyper-partisan atmosphere" has been frequently used by the news media and commentators to describe the political gridlock in Washington during the first years of the Obama administration.

This could include recess appointments bypassing both the "advice and consent" of the Senate, as well as any statutory restrictions. See, e.g., Scott Wilson, Obama Considers Recess Appointments, WASH. POST, Feb. 9, 2010 ("President Obama is considering recess appointments to fill some or all of the nominations held up in the Senate. President Bush used a recess appointment to make John Bolton the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations bypassing Democrats."). n22 Statutory restrictions date back to the first Congress and continue today. See infra notes 116, 118, 122. n23 See discussion infra Part I.D and note 128. n24 The phrase "political party restrictions" is used hereinafter to mean statutory restrictions on the President’s powers of nomination and appointment by political party.</p><h4 id="HJudicialrestrictionsarelimitsimposedbythecourts" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Judicial restrictions are limits imposed by the courts</span></h4><p>Charles Grove <strong>Haines</strong> – PhD, Fellow @ Columbia University – <strong>2001</strong>, The Conflict over Judicial Powers, googlebooks <br/>The political theories of the time favored judicial restriction of state laws to the point <br/>AND<br/>a short step, therefore, to Mar- bury vs. Madison.</p><h4 id="HTargetedkillingisthekillingofanindividualorgroupofindividualsexclusivelyforreasonsofself-defence2013that2019sdistinctfromassassinations2Cwhicharethepremeditatedkillingofaprominentpersonforpoliticalorideologicalreasons" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Targeted killing is the killing of an individual or group of individuals exclusively for reasons of self-defence – that’s distinct from assassinations, which are the premeditated killing of a prominent person for political or ideological reasons</span></h4><p>Thomas B.

The most important procedural element is the rule of law - the idea that disputes will be settled and agreements negotiated through the observance of established principles rather than the use of force or the intimidation of power. 8 In turn, the substantive principles, what the rule of law seeks to enforce, are those that nations have selected to settle disputes and negotiate agreements. The rule of law can be a way of resolving conflicts effectively, peacefully, and cooperatively. Furthermore, globalization enhances the perceived importance of distant international problems relative to local problems. Thus, protection of the environment beyond national borders has attracted strong international support, and the conflict between environment protection and economic development created the global issue of sustainable development. 9 &nbsp;~*431~ &nbsp;On the downside, technology together with economic and political globalization can facilitate the movement of criminal and terrorist activities across national boundaries and help criminals and terrorists to operate like efficient international businesses. 10 Most significantly for this Article, however, globalization is an important source of common economic and political values for humanity. Globalization is simultaneously a cause and a consequence of the convergence of basic economic and political systems among nations. As the activities of globalization help to converge economic and political systems, their existence reciprocally facilitates the expansion of globalization. Momentously, the convergence of these systems is leading to the convergence of fundamental values - deeply held beliefs about what is right and wrong. 11 There is a widespread, though not universal, acceptance among nations of the basic values of liberal democracy: a market economy (or free markets), a democratic government, and the protection of human rights. &nbsp;Although particular details may differ from country to country, the general nature of these values is the same. The convergence of basic economic and political values among nations is a pivotal event because it is a necessary, though not sufficient, condition for the eventual emergence of a consensus among human beings that there is but one human race. 12 This Article argues that the United States and the other industrialized democracies (e.g., the members of the European Union, Japan, and Canada), collectively referred to as the and#34;West,and#34; 13 should vigorously support and substantially guide the process of globalization. As it is currently emerging, globalization fosters desirable common national values by advancing general forms of market economies, democracy, and human rights. 14 It is precisely those general characteristics of liberal democracy that constitute the foundational pillars and shared values of the United States and the other industrialized democracies. 15 Because the exact form of globalization is not a fixed certainty, the United States and the other industrialized democracies should aggressively configure globalization to be consistent with and to promote the values of &nbsp;liberal democracy. The industrialized democracies must also ensure that the path of globalization fairly balances the values of free market economics, democracy, and human rights, while accommodating such vital concerns as the protection of the environment, concerns that do not yet generate as strong a global consensus as the three convergent values. 16 The mechanism for configuring globalization to conform to and to balance the values of liberal democracy consists of events and policies that, while difficult to achieve, are not unrealistic and have, to a degree, already been occurring. 17 A particularly useful event might be a catharsis that would place the world into the next millennium without the baggage of the past. Perhaps by the year 2001, the representatives of oppressors, victims, victors, losers, and adversaries could assemble on a world stage in a therapeutic ceremony to put the past behind. 18 Given their economic preeminence in the world, by acting in unison the industrialized democracies should be able to determine the specific content of globalization. Action from the industrialized democracies is needed because a humane globalization will increase human wealth and reduce human suffering. 19 Morally, the promotion of liberal democratic values and the perspective of a single human race would serve to repay the historic debts that the industrialized countries have incurred over the past centuries. 20 At the same time, the industrialized democracies must be careful to use their influence responsibly and sensitively, for the wisest ideas pursued for the best motives may be rejected when unilaterally imposed upon the rest of the world. Perceived economic and political and#34;imperialism,and#34; though much less malevolent than military imperialism, will not be warmly greeted. The primary vehicle for the industrialized democracies should be the and#34;rule of lawand#34; - assuming that they have a substantial, if not commanding voice in determining its underlying principles. An enlightened globalization will not lead to the establishment of a world government. It could, however, create a new attitude among human beings and serve the interests of the United States. 21 More profoundly, advancing globalization will facilitate an event barely begun that holds the great potential of constructing, in the distant future, the perspective that the human race matters more than its component divisions along race, religion, or ethnicity. The vision of a common humanity is reason enough to embrace globalization. I. The Background of Globalization Today, more than ever, the events of foreign lands have important economic and political consequences for local inhabitants. To be sure, foreign events have had significant ramifications in the past. Centuries ago, seminal inventions in China revolutionized the culture, science, and warfare of Europeans; the opening of American borders to European immigrants from the 19th through the mid-20th centuries gave millions a new home; and the conflicts in Europe during WorldWarI eventually brought the United States onto the European battleground. 23 But these events were of sporadic importance. For example, after World War I ended, the United States isolated itself in a number of respects from international politics and trade; America declined membership in the League of Nations and enacted the Smoot-Hawley tariffs in 1931 which drastically reduced imports. 24 By contrast, transnational activities and affairs now have continuous importance, repeatedly affecting not just distant countries, but also the entire global community at times. The continuous importance of international events is a defining characteristic of globalization. Another feature of globalization with potentially profound implications is the convergence of basic economic and political values among nations towards the liberal democratic values of the industrialized democracies, the and#34;West.and#34; 25 For the West, the liberal, democratic values of market &nbsp;~*434~ &nbsp;economies, democracy, and human rights are fundamental. 26 Given the arguably shallow roots of liberal democratic values in a number of countries and the absence of democracy and human rights in many others, this process may perhaps be too incomplete to be described as a convergence of &nbsp;~*435~ &nbsp;fundamental values. Nevertheless, today there are greater similarities between the economic and political systems of nations than at any other time in the short history of globalization. 27 With careful and generous support from the West, this similarity of systems may evolve into a similarity of fundamental values. A. Globalization’s Beginning Identifying the birth of globalization is an elusive task, but one possible date is the year 1945, when the United States led the Allied powers in creating the United Nations and its companion international organizations, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (World Bank). 28 Later in 1948, the United States and its democratic allies established the General Agreement on Tar- &nbsp;~*436~ &nbsp;iffs and Trade (GATT), another important economic institution for globalization along with the IMF and the World Bank. 29 The motivations for creating these international institutions were at once noble and selfish. After the devastating experience of World War II, the victorious Allies were determined to prevent any reoccurrence of similar world wars. Their motivating hope was that a collegial body of nations would ensure the peaceful resolution of conflicts and provide a collective defense against wrongful aggression. 30 Thus, the United Nations was the focus of political attempts to prevent future acts of aggression. Further, unlike the League of Nations, the United Nations made the promotion of human rights one of its basic purposes. 31 Toward that end, the United Nations created various human rights institutions and generated human rights conventions and &nbsp;~*437~ &nbsp;declarations. 32 At the same time, the Allies thought it critical to lay the foundations for the economic prosperity of the international community. 33 Prosperous countries, it was thought, would be less inclined to wage wars. Thus, the Allies promoted activities that would raise the standard of living among peaceful countries. For example, the Allies established international economic institutions which were in part created to promote international monetary cooperation (the IMF), to foster economic development in less developed countries (the World Bank), and to increase international trade (the GATT). 34 &nbsp;~*438~ &nbsp;The creation of the United Nations, the IMF, the World Bank, and the GATT were key moments in globalization. These institutions signaled the start of an era of cooperative behavior, however imperfect, among nations. While the number of nations involved was limited, their cooperation required the development and formal recognition of common interests. The GATT and the United Nations, in particular, were critical components in the genesis of globalization. 35 In seeking to reduce barriers to trade of goods, the GATT contained free market principles that favored lower tariffs, banned quotas, and prohibited discrimination against foreign goods. 36 The United Nations, at least on paper, championed the principles of human rights and democratic forms of government. 37 As these principles &nbsp;~*439~ &nbsp;gained international acceptance, economic and political norms developed. That is, common values emerged. B. Economic Globalization In current usage, the term globalization refers primarily to economic globalization. As barriers to trade, investment, financial flows, and technology transfers have fallen, there has been an expansion of markets for goods, services, financial capital, and intellectual property to transnational, regional, and even global dimensions. 38 There are several hallmarks of economic globalization. First, it increases opportunities for sellers as well as buyers. Second, economic globalization simultaneously creates new competition. Third, it develops interdependency among nations. Finally, economic globalization spreads the ideology of the free market economy model because the industrialized nations, the major promoters of globalization, advocate free market policies. The enlargement of markets beyond national boundaries means that both sellers and buyers have greater choices. More firms issue equity &nbsp;~*440~ &nbsp;securities in, or obtain financing from, international markets. 39 They also find it profitable to sell their goods and services in, or buy their raw materials or components from, international markets. Worldwide trade now amounts to an astonishingly large figure, six trillion dollars in 1995, more than 80 the size of the gross domestic product of the United States, the world’s largest economy. 40 The existence of greater choice also extends to investment opportunities. Companies are investing in foreign countries, buying assets such as securities, businesses, facilities, and land, and have shifted production to &nbsp;~*441~ &nbsp;foreign factories. 41 Concurrently, sellers of such domestic assets now have &nbsp;~*442~ &nbsp;more buyers to choose from. The liberalization of investment opportunities - the removal of barriers - contributes to the liberalization of trade, and vice versa. 42 Expanding markets simultaneously generates more competition along with more opportunities; 43 domestic firms must compete not only with domestic but also foreign rivals. While benefiting domestic consumers, foreign competition may threaten domestic businesses and employees. 44 Whether the foreign competition comes from imports or the local subsidiaries of foreign corporations, employees of domestic firms may lose their jobs as these firms lay off surplus employees in order to become more competitive. 45 Where local subsidiaries of foreign corporations provide competition, however, these subsidiaries will create new jobs that replace, in &nbsp;~*443~ &nbsp;part, jobs lost at domestic firms. 46 One of the major consequences of increased foreign competition and the domestic drive for efficiency is that countries have become more willing to privatize and deregulate. 47 By making foreign countries important sources of consumers, investors, and suppliers, globalization creates interdependence. When domestic businesses buy from and sell to foreign markets, their financial welfare becomes linked to those markets. More domestic companies have evolved into multinational corporations, firms that have economic interests in several countries. Businesses set up partnerships with foreign firms, to share technology and risk, in order to create new products. 48 Because customers as well as suppliers are foreign, firms in one country become economically dependent upon firms in other countries. When foreign firms likewise become dependent upon domestic markets, interdependence is established as the economic prosperity of one nation becomes connected to that of other countries. For virtually all countries, transnational trade is important, if not vital, to their economic prosperity. 49 As economic globalization integrates various national markets into regional or world-wide markets, it also promotes general free market prin- &nbsp;~*444~ &nbsp;ciples, such as the quintessential concept of the market mechanism to allocate resources, 50 reduce protectionism in international trade, 51 and &nbsp;~*445~ &nbsp;privatize and deregulate. 52 Well before the collapse of the Soviet Union or even the end of the Cold War, the market economy (free market) paradigm of the West emerged as the decisive winner in the economic contest with the command (or planned) economy paradigm of the Soviet bloc. 53 Since globalization is being led by the corporations and governments in the capitalist economies of the industrialized democracies, it naturally advocates the ideology of the winners rather than the losers. Thus, the rules underlying globalization seek to expand markets among market economy rather than command economy principles. 54 For example, the WTO espouses the implementation of free-market ground rules to cover international trade and trade-related aspects of &nbsp;~*446~ &nbsp;investment and intellectual property. 55 &nbsp;n55. The IMF and the World Bank, too, have promoted market economy principles. See, e.g., James supra note 28, at 323 (IMF conditionality, the terms on which it will lend, has often required budgetary and domestic credit restraints, as well as trade liberalization); World Bank, The East Asian Miracle: Economic Growth and Public Policy 10 (1993) ~hereinafter East Asian Miracle~ (advocating a and#34;market friendlyand#34; strategy in which and#34;the appropriate role of government is to ensure adequate investments in people, provide a competitive climate for private enterprise, keep the economy open to international trade, and maintain a stable macroeconomyand#34<img src="../../resources/icons/silk/emoticon_wink.png" tppabs="http://opencaselist13.paperlessdebate.com/resources/icons/silk/emoticon_wink.png" class="wikimodel-freestanding" alt="emoticon_wink"/>; Barend A. de Vries, Remaking the World Bank 6, 56-58 (1987) (describing how the World Bank has encouraged decentralized planning rather than command-type central planning, and has made substantial loans to help borrowing nations increase their economies’ efficiency and competitiveness, such as by liberalizing trade); cf.

At this time, however, the WTO is the most important of the international economic institutions in carrying out the implementation of free market principles, primarily the idea of opening markets (liberalizing trade) among countries. The WTO agreements have gone beyond the GATT in covering trade in services as well as trade-related aspects of intellectual property and trade-related investment measures.

Its rules go further than those of the GATT, its predecessor in carrying out the free market principle of comparative advantage by stamping out protectionism among nations. 56 When tools of protectionism - such as tariffs, quotas, or domestic subsidies - are reduced, foreign imports can better enter a domestic market, creating more competition for local firms. &nbsp;n56. For instance, the WTO makes a member’s subsidy to its domestic industry actionable by another member if its effect and#34;is to displace or impede the imports of a like product of another Member into the market of the subsidizing Member.and#34; Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, Agreements on Trade in Goods, Apr. 15, 1994, Marrakesh Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization, Annex 1A, art. 6.3(a), available in <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://itl.irv.uit.no/trade  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://itl.irv.uit.no/trade%27" tppabs="http://itl.irv.uit.no/trade"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://itl.irv.uit.no/trade</span></a></span> law/documents/freetrade (visited Mar. 29, 1997). The presence of increased competition contributes to the development of more efficient local firms as only the fittest firms will survive in a competitive marketplace. The use of a market and consumer choice, rather than a bureaucracy, to determine the survival of firms and products is the essence of a free market. 57 Not surprisingly, the various WTO agreements are expected to substantially &nbsp;~*447~ &nbsp;increase global income. 58 C. Political Globalization As economic globalization expands, it has been accompanied by a somewhat lesser degree of political globalization in that there are now substantial numbers of elected governments. 59 Also, the rhetoric of human rights has gained universal acceptance, and more nations than ever before have pledged to protect human rights. 60 With political globalization, there is &nbsp;~*448~ &nbsp;more than just the existence of elected governments and the recognition of human rights by governments. Political globalization has also tended to cause a convergence in political values, with the genuine acceptance of democracy and human rights in a greater number of countries. Compared to the convergence in economic values, the convergence of political values has had a more difficult path. The growth of economic globalization was championed by countries that realized they would gain economically by increased foreign trade. Even the command-economy communist nations sought trade with the capitalist economies of the West. 61 Well before the end of the Cold War, some communist nations even embraced capitalism to an extent. As events in China have clearly shown, dictatorship and a dismal human rights record have not been incompatible with free market policies. 62 Unlike economic globalization, the support for political globalization historically has been weak, perhaps because its benefits were not as obvious or immediate. Despite their long history predating free market principles, the political values of democracy and human rights have been more dishonored by breach than honored by observance. 63 Most countries did &nbsp;~*449~ &nbsp;not espouse them, and those that did applied these concepts selectively. 64 For decades after the end of World WarII, the spread of humanitarian political values had to contend with severe obstacles. 65 For much of the &nbsp;~*450~ &nbsp;existence of the United Nations, the most important international organization devoted to the promotion of democracy and human rights, many of its leading members either did not observe democratic values or human rights domestically, or subordinated these values to other priorities in foreign affairs. 66 Despite initial obstacles, however, these political values slowly developed roots in non-western countries. Even before the end of the Cold War, the past two decades saw the emergence of a greater number of countries with democratic governments and protective of human rights. 67 These countries offer political rights and &nbsp;~*451~ &nbsp;civil liberties that make them different in kind from past authoritarian regimes. With the end of the Cold War, many of the former Soviet-allied countries established popularly elected governments. Earlier, elected governments emerged from dictatorships in Latin America, Asia, and Africa. 68 As the transformation of South Africa - the former bastion of apartheid - into a democratic country shows, the unbelievable can happen. The outlook today is promising for the values of democracy and, to a lesser extent, human rights. First, with the triumph of liberal democracy over communism in the Cold War, 69 the United States and its allies can now more vigorously pursue humanitarian rather than security objectives. Second, the commonality of democracy and human rights in nations has provided more reason for these nations to cooperate among themselves in trade, humanitarian, and security matters, as well as in trying to nurture the qualities of democracy and human rights in authoritarian countries. The remaining authoritarian strongholds face pressures to democratize, and to recognize some level of human rights. 70 Democracy has been easier to achieve than the protection of human rights, perhaps because the implementation of democracy is technically more easily accomplished (e.g., a popularly elected government), while there may be disagreement over which rights are basic human rights and how these basic rights are to be protected. 71 Furthermore, elected governments need not necessarily protect human rights, especially in nascent &nbsp;~*452~ &nbsp;democracies which may have problems of illiteracy, corruption, authoritarian traditions, ethnic or religious conflicts, and a winner-takes-all political system. 72 The value of democratic governments is that their actions reflect the desires of a majority of the people rather than the wishes of a tyrant or a select few. Democracy is arguably the most basic human right because it recognizes the sovereignty of the people in that a government pursues policies which the majority of the people support through their freely elected representatives. The preferences of at least a majority of its population, rather than the desires of a select few, influence democratic governments. Democratic governments are much more likely to respect human rights, at least those of the majority, than authoritarian regimes which are unaccountable to an electorate. Of course, democracy is not itself a sufficient condition for a humane society, since a majority may persecute or subjugate a minority in a democratic society. 73 A practical benefit of mature democracies, those having democratic governments for a long period of time, is that they substantially protect a wide variety of human rights and are much less likely to use military force to resolve conflicts. 74 &nbsp;~*453~ &nbsp;Despite disagreement over the extent to which human rights should be protected, some level of human rights protection exists for a substantial percentage, if not the majority, of the world’s population. 75 For an increasing number of countries, there seems to be a real, as opposed to a rhetorical, acceptance of some form of human rights. While inadequate and imperfect, this is an enormous improvement over the past. While outrageous examples of inhumanity still occur, such as in Rwanda, they are universally condemned. &nbsp;In an indirect way, the cultural impact of economic globalization stimulates political globalization. Economic globalization has long introduced aspects of foreign cultures - especially American culture - either directly by the sale of merchandise such as movies and musical recordings, or indirectly through exposure to foreigners. 77 More than in the past, &nbsp;the opening of new markets through economic globalization has brought a flood of people and companies into foreign lands. Personal contact, always so important in understanding other human beings, has made foreigners less inscrutable. More business personnel are assigned to overseas offices, more consumers travel abroad as tourists, and more students study in foreign countries. 78 Local residents are more likely than ever before to work for, do business with, or personally know foreigners. In some cases, this transnational encounter may lead to a personal affinity with or an in-depth understanding of foreign cultures. 79 &nbsp;~*455~ &nbsp;Further, economic globalization has generated an interest in learning foreign languages, primarily English. Perhaps irreversibly, English has become the international language of business and science, with a broader usage than any other language. 80 At the same time, the ability to speak a foreign language other than English gives one a competitive advantage in doing business in nonEnglish-speaking countries. 81 Doing business with foreigners, in their country or in one’s own, requires that one communicate with them, cooperate with them, and be exposed to their political and business values. 82 The political values of democracy and human rights, as well as aspects of foreign cultures, are often inseparable (though secondary) components of economic globalization. Thus, countries that seek to benefit from economic globalization must frequently tolerate political globalization and exposure to foreign cultures. As people know more about foreign cultures, some familiarity with foreign political values is bound to arise. II. Technology’s Vital Role in Converging Values The advanced communication technology that links much of the world together continues to be crucial to the convergence of economic and political values. This technology is utilized primarily by business entities to facilitate economic globalization. 83 Modern technology has also tended to promote democracy and human rights by making it easier and cheaper for &nbsp;~*456~ &nbsp;people to communicate without censorship across national boundaries. Communication technology not only exposes a national population to foreign ideas, but also concurrently exposes domestic conditions to a global audience. qThis has occurred because economic globalization involves communication technologies with multiple uses. The same technology that transmits a business proposal may also communicate politically embarrassing or other non-business information. These multiple uses of advanced technology cannot easily be separated from each other, making it difficult to restrict the technology to purely business purposes. A country that wishes to participate in international business cannot isolate itself from all uses of communication technologies unrelated to business dealings. 84 The internet 85 is a recent communication medium with tremendous potential for linking people across national boundaries, furthering mutual interests of the international community, and a myriad of other uses. 86 The internet will become, or may already be, an important or even critical technological medium for business, as well as for scientific research and consumer enjoyment. 87 The internet is the essential part of the and#34;informa- &nbsp;~*457~ &nbsp;tion superhighway,and#34; a source of information that promises to change fundamentally human lives. 88 E-mail and computer file transmission on the internet can potentially provide a more powerful (e.g., faster, cheaper, more convenient) business tool than such conventional devices as the postal service, telephones, and faxes. Internet users can transmit and download data, articles, images, movies, speeches, sound recordings, and other information. 89 By providing a forum for the transfer of such information, the internet will help protect the freedoms of expression and choice for followers of any ideological persuasion. 90 Unfortunately, however, it may shield criminal, obscene, &nbsp;~*458~ &nbsp;racist, and terrorist activities as well. 91 A government might attempt to control the content of information transfers. It could screen large numbers of telephone calls, faxes, or computer data; it could restrict access to or intercept messages on the internet. Total censorship, however, would bring a halt to international business. 92 Firms might object if government surveillance is too pervasive. For example, companies might not want government officials to be privy to proprietary information. 93 A certain amount of freedom of communication is therefore assured if a country wishes to be part of a global economy: international firms will leave a nation if censorship prohibitively increases the cost of doing business. This will remain true even if governments attempt to censor communications using the most advanced and cost-effective surveillance technology available. 94 &nbsp;~*459~ &nbsp;Communication technologies not essential to international business transactions also serve to bolster humanitarian political values. International news reporting utilizes communication technologies to broadcast major domestic events of all types on a worldwide screen. There are numerous journalists, broadcasters, and commentators whose professional livelihood depends upon bringing newsworthy stories to a foreign, if not international, audience. While most publicized stories may not involve political events, many do. The competitive members of the news media are unlikely to let stories of outrageous acts completely escape the attention of the international public. Furthermore, these news articles may be read by anyone in the world who has access to the internet. 95 At the same time, news stories alone would not generate international repercussions against repressive governments if purely theoretical political values were involved. There must be influential constituencies that place high priority on the existence of democracy and human rights, that seek to spread those values, and that are galvanized into action upon news of deplorable political conditions. Neither value would flourish unless there were constituencies, either domestic or abroad, that strongly supported it. The presence of democratic governments and strong protections for human rights in the industrialized countries means that these values are expressed to some degree in their business transactions with other countries. 96 Sizable populations in the industrialized countries also attempt to support democracy and human rights abroad through private means. 97 Moreover, as the living standards of developing countries improve, the citizenry of these countries seem to expect more democratization (first) and &nbsp;~*460~ &nbsp;human rights (later). 98 III. The Importance of Globalization Because globalization promotes common values across nations and can make foreign problems, conditions, issues, and debates as vivid and captivating as national, state, and local ones, it contributes to a sense of world community. 99 It develops a feeling of empathy for the conditions of people abroad, enlarging the group of human beings that an individual will identify with. Globalization thus helps to bring alive persons in foreign lands, making them fellow human beings who simply live in different parts of the world rather than abstract statistics of deaths, poverty, and suffering. The convergence of basic political and economic values is thus fundamentally important because it helps to establish a common bond among people in different countries, facilitating understanding and encouraging cooperation. All other things being equal, the commonality among countries - whether in the form of basic values, culture, or language - enhances their attractiveness to each other. 100 In addition, convergence increases the possibility that a transformation of attitude will take place for those who participate in transnational activities. People will begin to regard foreigners in distant lands with the same concern that they have for their fellow citizens. 101 They will endeavor to help these foreigners obtain basic political rights even though the status of political rights in other countries will have no tangible beneficial impact at home. 102 Convergence does not mean that there is a single model of a market economy, a single type of democracy, or a single platform of human rights. They exist in different forms, and nations may have different combinations of these forms. 103 &nbsp;~*462~ &nbsp;A. The Perspective of One Human Race The convergence of fundamental values through globalization has profound consequences because it increases the chance that a new perspective will develop, one which views membership in the human race as the most significant societal relationship, except for nationality. 104 A person owes his or her strongest collective loyalties to the various societies with which he or she most intensely identifies. Today, this societal identification can be based on numerous factors, including nationality, race, religion, and ethnic group. 105 While it is unlikely that nationality will be surpassed as the most significant societal relationship, globalization and the convergence of values may eventually convince people in different countries that the second most important social group is the human race, and not a person’s racial, religious, or ethnic group. 106 One of the first steps in the formation of a society is the recognition by prospective members that they have common interests and bonds. An essential commonality is that they share some fundamental values. A second is that they identify themselves as members belonging to the same community on the basis of a number of common ties, including shared fundamental values. A third commonality is the universality of rights - the active application of the and#34;golden ruleand#34; - by which members expect that all must be entitled to the same rights as well as charged with the same responsibilities to ensure that these rights are protected. Globalization promotes these three types of commonalities. Globalization establishes common ground by facilitating the almost universal acceptance of market economies, the widespread emergence of democratic governments, and the extensive approval of human rights. The most visible example is economic. With the end of the Cold War, the free market economy has clearly triumphed over the command economy in the battle of the &nbsp;~*463~ &nbsp;economic paradigms. Because some variant of a market economy has taken root in virtually all countries, there has been a convergence of sorts in economic systems. 107 Further, because it often requires exposure to and pervasive interaction with foreigners - many of whom share the same fundamental values - globalization can enlarge the group that one normally identifies with. Globalization makes many of its participants empathize with the conditions and problems of people who in earlier years would have been ignored as unknown residents of remote locations. This empathy often leads to sympathy and support when these people suffer unfairly. Finally, the combination of shared values and identification produce the third commonality, universality of rights. 108 Citizens of one country will often expect, and work actively to achieve, the same basic values in other countries. They will treat nationals of other nations as they would wish to be treated. The effects of shared values, identification, and universality of rights in globalization could have a pivotal long-term effect - the possibility that a majority of human beings will begin to believe that they are truly part of a single global society - the human race. This is not to say that people disbelieve the idea that the human race encompasses all human beings. Of course, they realize that there is only one human species. Rather, the human race does not usually rank high on the hierarchy of societies for most people. Smaller societies, especially those based on nationality, race, religion, or ethnicity, command more loyalty. 109 The idea of the human race, the broadest and all-inclusive category of the human species, is abstract and has little, if any, impact on the lives of human beings. To believe in the singular importance of the human race requires an attitudinal shift in which a person views the human race seriously. &nbsp;~*464~ &nbsp;This may occur because the convergence of values does not only mean that the people of different countries will share the same basic values. It may also lead to the greater promotion of these values for the people of other countries. Historically and certainly today, America and the other industrial democracies have attempted to foster democracy and human rights in other countries. 110 While some part of this effort has been attributable to and#34;self interest,and#34; it has also been due to the empathy that the industrialized democracies have had for other countries. 111 The magnitude of these efforts in the future, as in the past, will depend not solely upon the available financial and human resources of the industrialized democracies. It will also depend upon their national will - a factor undoubtedly influenced by the intensity with which the people of the industrialized democracies identify with people in foreign lands. The perspective that the human race matters more than its component divisions would accelerate cooperative efforts among nations to attack global problems that adversely affect human rights and the quality of human life. 112 Obviously, there is no shortage of such problems. Great suffering still occurs in so many parts of the world, not just from internal armed conflicts, 113 but also from conditions of poverty. 114 There are severe health problems in much of the world which can be mitigated with relatively little cost. 115 There are the lives lost to the AIDS epidemic, and &nbsp;~*465~ &nbsp;the deaths and disabilities caused by land mines. 116 Russia, a nuclear superpower that could end life on this planet, has severe social, economic, and political problems. 117 Making the human race important would not just promote liberal democratic values but would also reduce human suffering and perhaps eliminate completely the risk of nuclear war.. &nbsp;B. General Convergence of Values &nbsp;&nbsp;Assuming that the formation of a single human society is a possible outcome, two broad questions should be answered: what kind of human society is being created, and is this society desirable. The answer to the latter question will depend on an evaluator’s subjective judgment of the society that is being formed. Undoubtedly, the great majority of human beings would abhor a world society that was being created by the conquests of a totalitarian government. Presumably, most Americans (and many citizens of other countries) would reject even a benevolent, democratic global society in which a world government dominated by other countries dictated laws that governed the lives of all human beings. If either outcome were present, many would call for a halt to globalization. Thus the direction that globalization follows is critical for assessing its appeal. &nbsp;What globalization has brought is a general convergence of fundamental economic and political systems among many nations. These systems are not identical. There are still innumerable differences among countries with market economies, democratic governments, and respectful of human rights. n118 The practices of one country may be intolerable to another coun- &nbsp;~*466~ &nbsp;try. n119 Furthermore, it is unlikely and probably undesirable that economic and political systems will ever exactly converge. Nor is it foreseeable that the nations of the world will coalesce into one. &nbsp;Even among the industrialized democracies, there are enough dissimilarities in market economies, democratic governments, and attitudes towards human rights that make some believe that the differences between these nations outweigh the similarities. For example, Japan is frequently characterized as having a producer-oriented market economy, as compared with the consumer-oriented market economy of the United States. n120 In general, the members of the European Union more extensively regulate their economies than the United States, engaging at times in social engineering that seems contrary to market principles as interpreted by Americans. n121 In the area of criminal justice, the United States is virtually alone in permitting the death penalty and imprisons a much higher percentage &nbsp;~*467~ &nbsp;of its population than other industrialized democracies. n122 &nbsp;Nonetheless, the basic economic and political systems of different countries clearly share more similarities than ever before. When asked to characterize their existing economic and political systems, more people in more countries than ever before will respond that they have a and#34;marketand#34; economy, that their government is and#34;democratic,and#34; and that they protect and#34;human rights.and#34; Importantly, the convergence of values seems to be accompanying the convergence of systems. Certainly, most people in the industrialized democracies would view their existing economic and political systems as expressing the foundational values of their societies - the values that define their society. n123 The convergence of values along liberal demo- &nbsp;~*468~ &nbsp;cratic lines means that nations are better situated to negotiate wealth-maximizing trade &nbsp;agreements and to resolve political disputes peacefully. &nbsp;But in countries in transition from authoritarian to liberal democracy, many people may not yet fully accept their newly established economic and political systems as reflecting fundamental values of what is correct, proper, or right. Whether these transitional countries continue to establish or possess liberal democracies will depend upon how well the systems of liberal democracy work, an outcome that the industrialized democracies should strive vigorously to achieve. Workable systems can evolve into entrenched values. &nbsp;Obviously, the implantation of the values of liberal democracy in Russia is of paramount concern. n124 Nurturing a democratic Russia is in the vital national interest of the United States (and the rest of the world) for very practical reasons - only Russia and the United States possess sufficient nuclear weapons to end human civilization. n125 Whether by unilateral or multilateral extensions of financial assistance or political inclusion, the industrialized democracies should do their utmost to make Russia a strong liberal democracy. Economic aid should be generous, and Russia should be incorporated into the activities of the industrialized democracies as much as possible. n126 &nbsp;Not all basic values are converging and nor, perhaps, should they. Religious values are not converging in the sense that the same general religion, such as Christianity, is taking root in a preponderance of countries. n127 Nevertheless, the convergence of economic and political values means that there is a greater basis for cooperation. For that reason, the &nbsp;~*469~ &nbsp;and#34;Westand#34; n128 - that is, the United States and the other industrialized democracies - should support the process of value convergence. &nbsp;Sharing the same values creates similar expectations and a common ground for understanding. The more prevalent reliance upon market forces to direct production and consumption means that nations are more likely to trade with and invest in each other. The relative sameness of political values, for example, the prevelant use of negotiation rather than military force in settling disputes, means that nations can have greater trust in and less to fear from each other.The similarity of basic values also means that the different peoples of humanity are one step closer to viewing themselves primarily as part of one human society - the human race - though represented by different governments.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h3 id="H2NCATImpactDefense" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>2NC AT Impact Defense</span></h3><p><strong>Broad studies prove our argument</strong><br/><strong>Royal, ’10</strong> ~2010, Jedediah Royal is the Director of Cooperative Threat Reduction at the U.S. Department of Defense, and#34;Economic Integration, Economic Signaling and the Problem of Economic Crises, Economics of War and Peace: Economic, Legal and Political Perspectivesand#34;, ed.

The administration’s and#34;full court pressand#34; to try to persuade lawmakers to approve military force on Syria was heavily criticized and did not yield much success.<br/>and#34;He probably has suffered some damage in Congress because there are probably many people on (Capitol Hill) who have increasing doubts about the basic competence of the administration and that’s a disadvantage in any kind of negotiation,and#34; Pitney said.<br/>BUDGET BATTLES<br/>Among Obama’s most immediate challenges are two looming budget fights. By Sept. 30, Congress and the president must agree on legislation to keep federal agencies funded or face a government shutdown.<br/>Two weeks later, Congress must raise the limit on the country’s ability to borrow or risk a possible debt default that could cause chaos in financial markets.<br/>On the first budget showdown, Obama may be at a strategic advantage because of divisions among opposition Republicans about whether to use the spending bill to provoke a fight over Obama’s signature health care law, known as Obamacare.<br/>House Republican leaders are trying to rally the party around a temporary spending measure that would keep the government funded until Dec. 15 but are facing resistance within their own caucus from some conservatives who want to cut off funding for Obamacare, even if it means a government shutdown.<br/>The debt limit fight could end up going down to the wire and unnerving financial markets. Republicans want to use that standoff to extract concessions from the Democratic president, such as spending cuts and a delay in the health law. But Obama has said he has no intention of negotiating over the borrowing limit.<br/>Another challenge for Obama will be reviving momentum for immigration reform. Sweeping legislation that would grant a path to citizenship for 11 million undocumented immigrants has passed the Democratic-led Senate but has been stalled in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.<br/>Over the past week and half, lobbyists and other supporters of immigration reform have become worried that the Syria issue could doom the legislation in the House by limiting the amount of time lawmakers have to consider it.<br/>But lobbyists are not ready to give up and have continued meeting with lawmakers to press the issue.<br/>Some activists believe Obama could create pressure on Republicans to act by making greater use of the bully pulpit. The White House has sought to strike a balance between calling for action and giving Congress space to consider the issue.<br/>Another pressing domestic matter will be picking a candidate to succeed Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, whose term expires in January. Obama has been leaning toward Lawrence Summers, a former top White House aide and Treasury secretary, who is controversial within his own Democratic Party.<br/>Any candidate for Fed chairman will require confirmation by the U.S. Senate.<br/>On issues like the budget battles in which Obama will go toe-to-toe with Republicans, the Syria push will have little fallout for Obama, predicted Matt Bennett, senior vice president at Third Way, a center-left think tank.<br/>Republicans showed a huge resistance to Obama’s agenda well before the administration’s effort to win congressional backing on Syria began to falter, Bennett noted. He said the time focused on Syria over the last week and half did nothing to change that dynamic.<br/>and#34;I certainly don’t think the situation he’s in today is markedly different from the one he faced a <br/>few weeks ago,and#34; Bennett said.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HObamahasleveragetoincreasedebtceilingnow2014-hiscapitaliskey" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Obama has leverage to increase debt ceiling now —- his capital is key</span></h4><p><strong>Khunhenn, 9/8</strong> (Jim, The Associated Press, and#34;Issues test Obama’s persuasion, mobilizing skills,and#34; Lexis))</p><p>The tasks stacking up before President Barack Obama over the coming weeks will test his persuasion powers and his mobilizing skills more than any other time in his presidency.<br/>How well Obama handles the challenges in the concentrated amount of time before him could determine whether he leads the nation from a position of strength or whether he becomes a lame duck one year into his second term.<br/>Between now and the end of October, Obama must convince wary lawmakers that they should grant him authority to take military action against Syria; take on Congress in an economy-rattling debate over spending and the nation’s borrowing limit; and oversee a crucial step in the putting in place his prized health care law.<br/>The Syria vote looms as his first, biggest and perhaps most defining challenge. His mission is persuading Congress and bringing the public along to approve armed action against the Syrian government in response to a chemical attack that Obama blames on President Bashar Assad’s government.<br/>and#34;It’s conceivable that, at the end of the day, I don’t persuade a majority of the American people that it’s the right thing to do,and#34; Obama acknowledged in a news conference Friday.<br/>His chief of staff, Denis McDonough, was asked on and#34;Fox News Sundayand#34; whether a congressional rejection might endanger Obama’s presidency, and he responded: and#34;Politics is somebody else’s concern. The president is not interested in the politics of this.and#34;<br/>Presidents tend to have an advantage on issues of national security, a tradition demonstrated by the support Obama has won for action in Syria from the bipartisan leadership of the House. But that has not translated so far into firm support among the rank and file.<br/>and#34;Congress can look presidents in the eye on a level gaze regarding the budget,and#34; the presidential historian H.W. Brands said. and#34;But on war and peace they have to look up to the president, he’s the commander in chief.<br/>and#34;If he does lose, even if the loss comes about partly as a result from negative Democratic votes, the Republicans are going to get the bit in their teeth and say `We’re not going to give this guy anything,’and#34; said Brands, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin, said.<br/>By that reasoning, success on Syria could give Obama some momentum.<br/>and#34;If he gets the authority it shows that he’s not a lame duck, that he still has some power,and#34; said John Feehery, a Republican strategist and former House GOP leadership aide. and#34;If he doesn’t get the authority, it’s devastating. People see him as the lamest of lame ducks.and#34;<br/>The Syria vote, however, is unusual and probably will not break along traditional partisan or ideological lines. Democrats and Republicans have voiced support and opposition to a military intervention.

The House would likely take the measure up the following week.<br/>Win or lose, Obama and lawmakers then would run headlong into a debate over the budget.<br/>Congress will have a limited window to continue government operations before the new budget year begins Oct. 1.<br/>Congressional leaders probably will agree to hold spending at current budget levels for about two months or three months. That would delay a confrontation with the White House and pair a debate over 2014 spending levels with the government’s need to raise its current 2416.7 trillion borrowing limit. The Treasury says the government will hit that ceiling in mid-October.<br/>Obama has been adamant that he will not negotiate over the debt limit. He says a similar faceoff in 2011 hurt the economy and caused Standard 26 Poors to lower its rating of the nation’s debt, which made it more expensive to borrow.<br/>White House officials say they ultimately have leverage because they believe Republicans would be punished politically for playing brinkmanship and threatening the nation with a default.<br/>The White House is counting on pressure from traditional Republican allies, particularly in the business sector. and#34;It is insane not to raise the debt ceiling,and#34; U.S. Chamber of Commerce President Thomas Donohue said last week on C-SPAN.

Raising the 2416.7tn borrowing cap promises to be a major struggle for House Republicans and President Obama.<br/>Two years ago Obama agreed to pair a 242.1tn increase in the debt limit with an equivalent amount in spending cuts spread over 10 years. But the president now says that he won’t negotiate over the debt limit and is asking Congress to send him a straightforward increase that would ensure the government can pay its bills.<br/>In January, House Republicans permitted an increase in the debt ceiling without demanding offsetting spending cuts.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h3 id="H2ncTradeOff2FPoliticalCapitalKey" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>2nc Trade Off / Political Capital Key</span></h3><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HObama2019scapitaliskeytoraisedebtceiling" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Obama’s capital is key to raise debt ceiling</span></h4><p><strong>Bull 26 Younglai, 9/5</strong> (Alister Bull and Rachelle Younglai, 9/5/2013, and#34;Analysis: Battle over Fed - Summers’ opponents seek to sway Obama,and#34;

If they fail to do so, the government would shut down, except for essential services.<br/>The nation is also rapidly approaching the drop-dead date for hitting the debt ceiling, which restricts Washington’s ability to loan money and cover its payment obligations. An analysis released Tuesday by the Bipartisan Policy Center estimated the country would hit the debt ceiling sometime between Oct. 18 and Nov. 5. <br/>Obama had hoped to enter those battles with momentum from a mid-August campaign-style tour that included a college bus trip through the Northeast, a visit to an Amazon shipping facility in Tennessee and a discussion of mortgage reform in Arizona. <br/>The president had planned to continue that push this week, but that plan was knocked aside by the alleged use of chemical weapons by Syria’s government on Aug. 21. &nbsp;<br/>Obama’s scheduled travel to Los Angeles, where he was slated to speak before union members at the AFL-CIO convention, was canceled so he could make his case for military strikes on Syria.<br/>Vice President Biden pressed the administration’s economic message with a Monday trip to Baltimore that highlighted a new 2410 million federal grant to widen the city’s port and better connect the shipping center to nearby rail lines.<br/>But that trip was overshadowed by a dinner he hosted the previous night at the Naval Observatory, where he and Obama lobbied a group of Republican senators to back air strikes against Syria.<br/>Carney acknowledged Wednesday that and#34;there is no question that Syria has consumed a lot of attention here in Washington, around the country, around the world.and#34;<br/>But the White House spokesman refused to make a and#34;political assessmentand#34; about whether the situation in Syria had affected Obama’s domestic policy hand.<br/>The administration and its allies seem ready to return to the economy.<br/>On Monday, Organizing for Action, the political advocacy group born from the president’s reelection campaign, asked supporters to sign a petition demanding that Congress avert a government shutdown.<br/>Rep.

Even his signature health care law came with significant compromises in Congress.<br/>Instead, over and over and over again, Obama delivered the simple line: Republicans want to repeal a law that was passed and upheld by the Supreme Court — to give people health insurance — or they’ll do something that everyone outside the GOP caucus meetings, including Wall Street bankers, seems to agree would be a ridiculous risk.<br/>"If we lock these Americans out of affordable health care for one more year," Obama said Monday afternoon as he listed examples of people who would enjoy better treatment under Obamacare, "if we sacrifice the health care of millions of Americans — then they’ll fund the government for a couple more months. Does anybody truly believe that we won’t have this fight again in a couple more months? Even at Christmas?"<br/>The president and his advisers weren’t expecting this level of Republican melee, a White <br/>AND<br/>until Saturday night, when the House voted again to strip Obamacare funding.<br/>This wasn’t a credible position, Obama said again Monday afternoon, but rather, bowing to "extraneous and controversial demands" which are "all to save face after making some impossible promises to the extreme right wing of their political party."<br/>Obama and aides have said repeatedly that they’re not thinking about the shutdown in terms of political gain, but the situation’s is taking shape for them. Congress’s approval on dealing with the shutdown was at 10 percent even before the shutters started coming down on Monday according to a new CNN/ORC poll, with 69 percent of people saying the House Republicans are acting like "spoiled children."<br/>"The Republicans are making themselves so radioactive that the president and Democrats can win this debate in the court of public opinion" by waiting them out, said Jim Manley, a Democratic strategist and former aide to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid who has previously been critical of Obama’s tactics.<br/>Democratic pollster Stan Greenberg said the Obama White House learned from the 2011 debt ceiling standoff, when it demoralized fellow Democrats, deflated Obama’s approval ratings and got nothing substantive from the negotiations.<br/>"They didn’t gain anything from that approach," Greenberg said. "I think that there’s a lot they learned from what happened the last time they ran up against the debt ceiling."<br/>While the Republicans have been at war with each other, the White House has proceeded calmly — a breakthrough phone call with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani Friday that showed him getting things done (with the conveniently implied juxtaposition that Tehran is easier to negotiate with than the GOP conference), his regular golf game Saturday and a cordial meeting Monday with his old sparring partner Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.<br/>White House press secretary Jay Carney said Monday that the shutdown wasn’t really affecting much of anything.<br/>"It’s busy, but it’s always busy here," Carney said. "It’s busy for most of you covering this White House, any White House. We’re very much focused on making sure that the implementation of the Affordable Care Act continues."<br/>Obama called all four congressional leaders Monday evening — including Boehner, whose staff spent Friday needling reporters to point out that the president hadn’t called for a week. According to both the White House and Boehner’s office, the call was an exchange of well-worn talking points, and changed nothing.<br/>Manley advised Obama to make sure people continue to see Boehner and the House Republicans as the problem and not rush into any more negotiations until public outrage forces them to bend.<br/>"He may want to do a little outreach, but not until the House drives the country over the cliff," Manley said Monday, before the shutdown. "Once the House has driven the country over the cliff and failed to fund the government, then it might be time to make a move."<br/>The White House believes Obama will take less than half the blame for a shutdown – with the rest heaped on congressional Republicans.<br/>The divide is clear in a Gallup poll also out Monday: over 70 percent of self-identifying Republicans and Democrats each say their guys are the ones acting responsibly, while just 9 percent for both say the other side is.<br/>If Obama is able to turn public opinion against Republicans, the GOP won’t be able to turn the blame back on Obama, Greenberg said. "Things only get worse once things begin to move in a particular direction," he said. "They don’t suddenly start going the other way as people rethink this."</p><h4 id="HDespiteDemocraticopposition2CattemptstocontroltargetedkillingwillundermineObama2019sagenda" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Despite Democratic opposition, attempts to control targeted killing will undermine Obama’s agenda</span></h4><p><strong>Hughes, 13</strong> (2/6/2013, Brian, "Obama’s base increasingly wary of drone program," <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://washingtonexaminer.com/obamas-base-increasingly-wary-of-drone-program/article/2520787)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://washingtonexaminer.com/obamas-base-increasingly-wary-of-drone-program/article/2520787)%27" tppabs="http://washingtonexaminer.com/obamas-base-increasingly-wary-of-drone-program/article/2520787)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://washingtonexaminer.com/obamas-base-increasingly-wary-of-drone-program/article/2520787)</span></a></span><br/>The heightened focus on President Obama’s targeted killings of American terror suspects overseas has rattled members of his progressive base who have stayed mostly silent during an unprecedented use of secret drone strikes in recent years.<br/>During the presidency of George W. Bush, Democrats, including then-Sen. Obama, hammered the administration for employing enhanced interrogation techniques, which critics labeled torture.<br/>Liberals have hardly championed the president’s drone campaign but have done little to force changes in the practice, even as the White House touts the growing number al Qaeda casualties in the covert war.<br/>The issue grates on some Democrats who backed Obama over Hillary Clinton because of her vote in favor of the war in Iraq, only to see the president ignore a campaign promise to close the detainee holding camp in Guantanamo, Cuba, and mount a troop surge in Afghanistan.<br/>Sign Up for the Politics Today newsletter21<br/>With the confirmation hearing Thursday for John Brennan, Obama’s nominee for CIA director — and the architect of the drone program — Democrats will have a high-profile opportunity to air their concerns over the controversial killings.<br/>"You watch and see — the left wing of the party will start targeting Obama over this," said Larry Sabato, a political scientist at the University of Virginia. "It’s inevitable. The drumbeat will increase as time goes on, especially with each passing drone strike."<br/>Obama late Wednesday decided to share with Congress’ intelligence committees the government’s legal reasoning for conducting drones strikes against suspected American terrorists abroad, the Associated Press reported. Lawmakers have long demanded to see the full document, accusing the Obama administration of stonewalling oversight efforts.<br/>Earlier in the day, one Democrat even hinted at a possible filibuster of Brennan if given unsatisfactory answers about the drone program.<br/>"I am going to pull out all the stops to get the actual legal analysis, because with out it, in effect, the administration is practicing secret law," said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., a member of the Senate Select Intelligence Committee. "This position is no different ~than~ that the Bush administration adhered to in this area, which is largely ’Trust us, we’ll make the right judgments.’ "<br/>In a Justice Department memo released this week, the administration argued it could order the killing of a suspected American terrorist even with no imminent threat to the homeland.<br/>White House press secretary Jay Carney insisted on Wednesday that the administration had provided an "unprecedented level of information to the public" about the drone operations. Yet, questions remain about who exactly orders the killings, or even how many operations have been conducted.<br/>"There’s been more noise from senators expressing increased discomfort ~with the drone program~," said Joshua Foust, a fellow at the American Security Project. "For Brennan, there’s going to be more opposition from Democrats than Republicans. It’s not just drones but the issue of torture."<br/>Facing concerns from liberals, Brennan had to withdraw his name from the running for the top CIA post in 2008 over his connections to waterboarding during the Bush administration.<br/>Since becoming president, Obama has championed and expanded most of the Bush-era terror practices that he decried while running for the White House in 2008.<br/>It’s estimated that roughly 2,500 people have died in drone strikes conducted by the Obama administration.<br/>However, most voters have embraced the president’s expanded use of drone strikes. A recent Pew survey found 62 percent of Americans approved of the U.S. government’s drone campaign against extremist leaders. And some analysts doubted whether Democratic lawmakers would challenged Obama and risk undermining his second-term agenda.<br/>"Democrats, they’re going to want the president to succeed on domestic priorities and don’t want to do anything to erode his political capital," said Christopher Preble, vice president for defense and foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute. "It’s just so partisan right now. An awful lot of ~lawmakers~ think the president should be able to do whatever he wants."</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HObama2019shardlinepositionagainstGOPnegotiatingdemandskeytopreventtheGOPfromdraggingtheprocessoutandtriggeringeconomiccollapse" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Obama’s hardline position against GOP negotiating demands key to prevent the GOP from dragging the process out and triggering economic collapse</span></h4><p><strong>Lobello, 8/27</strong> —- business editor at TheWeek.com (Carmel, 8/27/2013, "How the looming debt ceiling fight could screw up the U.S. economy; Yup, this is happening — again," <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://theweek.com/article/index/248775/how-the-looming-debt-ceiling-fight-could-screw-up-the-us-economy))  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://theweek.com/article/index/248775/how-the-looming-debt-ceiling-fight-could-screw-up-the-us-economy))%27" tppabs="http://theweek.com/article/index/248775/how-the-looming-debt-ceiling-fight-could-screw-up-the-us-economy))"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://theweek.com/article/index/248775/how-the-looming-debt-ceiling-fight-could-screw-up-the-us-economy))</span></a></span></p><p>Having two big deadlines fall two weeks apart could be a recipe for disaster. Republicans, led by Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), have been musing about the possibility of using the debt ceiling, instead of a government shutdown, as leverage to delay the implementation of ObamaCare.<br/>But as Ezra Klein put it in The Washington Post, "Trading a government shutdown for a debt-ceiling breach is like trading the flu for septic shock":<br/>Anything Republicans might fear about a government shutdown is far more terrifying amidst a debt-ceiling breach. The former is an inconvenience. The latter is a global financial crisis. It’s the difference between what happened in 1995, when the government did shutdown, and what happened in 2008, when global markets realized a bedrock investment they thought was safe (housing in that case, U.S. treasuries in this one) was full of risk. ~The Washington Post~<br/>Indeed, a debt ceiling debate in 2011 that went on to the last possible minute had real economic consequences, leading Standard 26 Poor’s to downgrade the United States’ credit rating. The move "left a clear and deep dent in US economic and market data," said Matt Phillips at Quartz.<br/>Investors pulled huge amounts of cash from the stock market, and consumer confidence was hurt as well. When the same problem cropped up again in May 2012, because Congress failed to reach a long-term deal, Betsey Stevenson and Justin Wolfers in Bloomberg explained how confidence plummeted the first time around:<br/>~Confidence~ went into freefall as the political stalemate worsened through July. Over the entire episode, confidence declined more than it did following the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008. After July 31, when the deal to break the impasse was announced, consumer confidence stabilized and began a long, slow climb that brought it back to its starting point almost a year later. ~Bloomberg~<br/>This morning, Wolfers had this to say:<br/>Treasury Secretary Jack Lew visited CNBC Tuesday morning to reiterate President Obama’s promise not to go down he same road. "The president has made it clear: We’re not going to negotiate over the debt limit," Lew said.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HThiswilldestroytheU.S.andglobaleconomyandcollapsetrade-1" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>This will destroy the U.S. and global economy and collapse trade</span></h4><p><strong>Davidson, 9/10</strong> (Adam - co-founder of NPR’s "Planet Money" 9/10/2013, "Our Debt to Society," <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/15/magazine/our-debt-to-society.html?pagewanted=all26_r=0))  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/15/magazine/our-debt-to-society.html?pagewanted=all26_r=0))%27" tppabs="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/15/magazine/our-debt-to-society.html?pagewanted=all26_r=0))"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/15/magazine/our-debt-to-society.html?pagewanted=all26_r=0))</span></a></span></p><p>This is the definition of a deficit, and it illustrates why the government needs <br/>AND<br/>they raise the debt ceiling — if they even raise it at all.<br/>If the debt ceiling isn’t lifted again this fall, some serious financial decisions will <br/>AND<br/>by most accounts, the largest self-imposed financial disaster in history.<br/>Nearly everyone involved predicts that someone will blink before this disaster occurs.

The most important procedural element is the rule of law - the idea that disputes will be settled and agreements negotiated through the observance of established principles rather than the use of force or the intimidation of power. 8 In turn, the substantive principles, what the rule of law seeks to enforce, are those that nations have selected to settle disputes and negotiate agreements. The rule of law can be a way of resolving conflicts effectively, peacefully, and cooperatively. Furthermore, globalization enhances the perceived importance of distant international problems relative to local problems. Thus, protection of the environment beyond national borders has attracted strong international support, and the conflict between environment protection and economic development created the global issue of sustainable development. 9 &nbsp;~*431~ &nbsp;On the downside, technology together with economic and political globalization can facilitate the movement of criminal and terrorist activities across national boundaries and help criminals and terrorists to operate like efficient international businesses. 10 Most significantly for this Article, however, globalization is an important source of common economic and political values for humanity. Globalization is simultaneously a cause and a consequence of the convergence of basic economic and political systems among nations. As the activities of globalization help to converge economic and political systems, their existence reciprocally facilitates the expansion of globalization. Momentously, the convergence of these systems is leading to the convergence of fundamental values - deeply held beliefs about what is right and wrong. 11 There is a widespread, though not universal, acceptance among nations of the basic values of liberal democracy: a market economy (or free markets), a democratic government, and the protection of human rights. &nbsp;Although particular details may differ from country to country, the general nature of these values is the same. The convergence of basic economic and political values among nations is a pivotal event because it is a necessary, though not sufficient, condition for the eventual emergence of a consensus among human beings that there is but one human race. 12 This Article argues that the United States and the other industrialized democracies (e.g., the members of the European Union, Japan, and Canada), collectively referred to as the "West," 13 should vigorously support and substantially guide the process of globalization. As it is currently emerging, globalization fosters desirable common national values by advancing general forms of market economies, democracy, and human rights. 14 It is precisely those general characteristics of liberal democracy that constitute the foundational pillars and shared values of the United States and the other industrialized democracies. 15 Because the exact form of globalization is not a fixed certainty, the United States and the other industrialized democracies should aggressively configure globalization to be consistent with and to promote the values of &nbsp;liberal democracy. The industrialized democracies must also ensure that the path of globalization fairly balances the values of free market economics, democracy, and human rights, while accommodating such vital concerns as the protection of the environment, concerns that do not yet generate as strong a global consensus as the three convergent values. 16 The mechanism for configuring globalization to conform to and to balance the values of liberal democracy consists of events and policies that, while difficult to achieve, are not unrealistic and have, to a degree, already been occurring. 17 A particularly useful event might be a catharsis that would place the world into the next millennium without the baggage of the past. Perhaps by the year 2001, the representatives of oppressors, victims, victors, losers, and adversaries could assemble on a world stage in a therapeutic ceremony to put the past behind. 18 Given their economic preeminence in the world, by acting in unison the industrialized democracies should be able to determine the specific content of globalization. Action from the industrialized democracies is needed because a humane globalization will increase human wealth and reduce human suffering. 19 Morally, the promotion of liberal democratic values and the perspective of a single human race would serve to repay the historic debts that the industrialized countries have incurred over the past centuries. 20 At the same time, the industrialized democracies must be careful to use their influence responsibly and sensitively, for the wisest ideas pursued for the best motives may be rejected when unilaterally imposed upon the rest of the world. Perceived economic and political "imperialism," though much less malevolent than military imperialism, will not be warmly greeted. The primary vehicle for the industrialized democracies should be the "rule of law" - assuming that they have a substantial, if not commanding voice in determining its underlying principles. An enlightened globalization will not lead to the establishment of a world government. It could, however, create a new attitude among human beings and serve the interests of the United States. 21 More profoundly, advancing globalization will facilitate an event barely begun that holds the great potential of constructing, in the distant future, the perspective that the human race matters more than its component divisions along race, religion, or ethnicity. The vision of a common humanity is reason enough to embrace globalization. I. The Background of Globalization Today, more than ever, the events of foreign lands have important economic and political consequences for local inhabitants. To be sure, foreign events have had significant ramifications in the past. Centuries ago, seminal inventions in China revolutionized the culture, science, and warfare of Europeans; the opening of American borders to European immigrants from the 19th through the mid-20th centuries gave millions a new home; and the conflicts in Europe during WorldWarI eventually brought the United States onto the European battleground. 23 But these events were of sporadic importance. For example, after World War I ended, the United States isolated itself in a number of respects from international politics and trade; America declined membership in the League of Nations and enacted the Smoot-Hawley tariffs in 1931 which drastically reduced imports. 24 By contrast, transnational activities and affairs now have continuous importance, repeatedly affecting not just distant countries, but also the entire global community at times. The continuous importance of international events is a defining characteristic of globalization. Another feature of globalization with potentially profound implications is the convergence of basic economic and political values among nations towards the liberal democratic values of the industrialized democracies, the "West." 25 For the West, the liberal, democratic values of market &nbsp;~*434~ &nbsp;economies, democracy, and human rights are fundamental. 26 Given the arguably shallow roots of liberal democratic values in a number of countries and the absence of democracy and human rights in many others, this process may perhaps be too incomplete to be described as a convergence of &nbsp;~*435~ &nbsp;fundamental values. Nevertheless, today there are greater similarities between the economic and political systems of nations than at any other time in the short history of globalization. 27 With careful and generous support from the West, this similarity of systems may evolve into a similarity of fundamental values. A. Globalization’s Beginning Identifying the birth of globalization is an elusive task, but one possible date is the year 1945, when the United States led the Allied powers in creating the United Nations and its companion international organizations, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (World Bank). 28 Later in 1948, the United States and its democratic allies established the General Agreement on Tar- &nbsp;~*436~ &nbsp;iffs and Trade (GATT), another important economic institution for globalization along with the IMF and the World Bank. 29 The motivations for creating these international institutions were at once noble and selfish. After the devastating experience of World War II, the victorious Allies were determined to prevent any reoccurrence of similar world wars. Their motivating hope was that a collegial body of nations would ensure the peaceful resolution of conflicts and provide a collective defense against wrongful aggression. 30 Thus, the United Nations was the focus of political attempts to prevent future acts of aggression. Further, unlike the League of Nations, the United Nations made the promotion of human rights one of its basic purposes. 31 Toward that end, the United Nations created various human rights institutions and generated human rights conventions and &nbsp;~*437~ &nbsp;declarations. 32 At the same time, the Allies thought it critical to lay the foundations for the economic prosperity of the international community. 33 Prosperous countries, it was thought, would be less inclined to wage wars. Thus, the Allies promoted activities that would raise the standard of living among peaceful countries. For example, the Allies established international economic institutions which were in part created to promote international monetary cooperation (the IMF), to foster economic development in less developed countries (the World Bank), and to increase international trade (the GATT). 34 &nbsp;~*438~ &nbsp;The creation of the United Nations, the IMF, the World Bank, and the GATT were key moments in globalization. These institutions signaled the start of an era of cooperative behavior, however imperfect, among nations. While the number of nations involved was limited, their cooperation required the development and formal recognition of common interests. The GATT and the United Nations, in particular, were critical components in the genesis of globalization. 35 In seeking to reduce barriers to trade of goods, the GATT contained free market principles that favored lower tariffs, banned quotas, and prohibited discrimination against foreign goods. 36 The United Nations, at least on paper, championed the principles of human rights and democratic forms of government. 37 As these principles &nbsp;~*439~ &nbsp;gained international acceptance, economic and political norms developed. That is, common values emerged. B. Economic Globalization In current usage, the term globalization refers primarily to economic globalization. As barriers to trade, investment, financial flows, and technology transfers have fallen, there has been an expansion of markets for goods, services, financial capital, and intellectual property to transnational, regional, and even global dimensions. 38 There are several hallmarks of economic globalization. First, it increases opportunities for sellers as well as buyers. Second, economic globalization simultaneously creates new competition. Third, it develops interdependency among nations. Finally, economic globalization spreads the ideology of the free market economy model because the industrialized nations, the major promoters of globalization, advocate free market policies. The enlargement of markets beyond national boundaries means that both sellers and buyers have greater choices. More firms issue equity &nbsp;~*440~ &nbsp;securities in, or obtain financing from, international markets. 39 They also find it profitable to sell their goods and services in, or buy their raw materials or components from, international markets. Worldwide trade now amounts to an astonishingly large figure, six trillion dollars in 1995, more than 80 the size of the gross domestic product of the United States, the world’s largest economy. 40 The existence of greater choice also extends to investment opportunities. Companies are investing in foreign countries, buying assets such as securities, businesses, facilities, and land, and have shifted production to &nbsp;~*441~ &nbsp;foreign factories. 41 Concurrently, sellers of such domestic assets now have &nbsp;~*442~ &nbsp;more buyers to choose from. The liberalization of investment opportunities - the removal of barriers - contributes to the liberalization of trade, and vice versa. 42 Expanding markets simultaneously generates more competition along with more opportunities; 43 domestic firms must compete not only with domestic but also foreign rivals. While benefiting domestic consumers, foreign competition may threaten domestic businesses and employees. 44 Whether the foreign competition comes from imports or the local subsidiaries of foreign corporations, employees of domestic firms may lose their jobs as these firms lay off surplus employees in order to become more competitive. 45 Where local subsidiaries of foreign corporations provide competition, however, these subsidiaries will create new jobs that replace, in &nbsp;~*443~ &nbsp;part, jobs lost at domestic firms. 46 One of the major consequences of increased foreign competition and the domestic drive for efficiency is that countries have become more willing to privatize and deregulate. 47 By making foreign countries important sources of consumers, investors, and suppliers, globalization creates interdependence. When domestic businesses buy from and sell to foreign markets, their financial welfare becomes linked to those markets. More domestic companies have evolved into multinational corporations, firms that have economic interests in several countries. Businesses set up partnerships with foreign firms, to share technology and risk, in order to create new products. 48 Because customers as well as suppliers are foreign, firms in one country become economically dependent upon firms in other countries. When foreign firms likewise become dependent upon domestic markets, interdependence is established as the economic prosperity of one nation becomes connected to that of other countries. For virtually all countries, transnational trade is important, if not vital, to their economic prosperity. 49 As economic globalization integrates various national markets into regional or world-wide markets, it also promotes general free market prin- &nbsp;~*444~ &nbsp;ciples, such as the quintessential concept of the market mechanism to allocate resources, 50 reduce protectionism in international trade, 51 and &nbsp;~*445~ &nbsp;privatize and deregulate. 52 Well before the collapse of the Soviet Union or even the end of the Cold War, the market economy (free market) paradigm of the West emerged as the decisive winner in the economic contest with the command (or planned) economy paradigm of the Soviet bloc. 53 Since globalization is being led by the corporations and governments in the capitalist economies of the industrialized democracies, it naturally advocates the ideology of the winners rather than the losers. Thus, the rules underlying globalization seek to expand markets among market economy rather than command economy principles. 54 For example, the WTO espouses the implementation of free-market ground rules to cover international trade and trade-related aspects of &nbsp;~*446~ &nbsp;investment and intellectual property. 55 &nbsp;n55. The IMF and the World Bank, too, have promoted market economy principles. See, e.g., James supra note 28, at 323 (IMF conditionality, the terms on which it will lend, has often required budgetary and domestic credit restraints, as well as trade liberalization); World Bank, The East Asian Miracle: Economic Growth and Public Policy 10 (1993) ~hereinafter East Asian Miracle~ (advocating a "market friendly" strategy in which "the appropriate role of government is to ensure adequate investments in people, provide a competitive climate for private enterprise, keep the economy open to international trade, and maintain a stable macroeconomy"); Barend A. de Vries, Remaking the World Bank 6, 56-58 (1987) (describing how the World Bank has encouraged decentralized planning rather than command-type central planning, and has made substantial loans to help borrowing nations increase their economies’ efficiency and competitiveness, such as by liberalizing trade); cf. John Williamson, Introduction, in IMF Conditionality, supra note 34, at xiii (stating that one complaint of borrowing countries is that the IMF is "ideologically biased in favor of free markets and against socialism"). At this time, however, the WTO is the most important of the international economic institutions in carrying out the implementation of free market principles, primarily the idea of opening markets (liberalizing trade) among countries. The WTO agreements have gone beyond the GATT in covering trade in services as well as trade-related aspects of intellectual property and trade-related investment measures.

Its rules go further than those of the GATT, its predecessor in carrying out the free market principle of comparative advantage by stamping out protectionism among nations. 56 When tools of protectionism - such as tariffs, quotas, or domestic subsidies - are reduced, foreign imports can better enter a domestic market, creating more competition for local firms. &nbsp;n56. For instance, the WTO makes a member’s subsidy to its domestic industry actionable by another member if its effect "is to displace or impede the imports of a like product of another Member into the market of the subsidizing Member."

The presence of increased competition contributes to the development of more efficient local firms as only the fittest firms will survive in a competitive marketplace. The use of a market and consumer choice, rather than a bureaucracy, to determine the survival of firms and products is the essence of a free market. 57 Not surprisingly, the various WTO agreements are expected to substantially &nbsp;~*447~ &nbsp;increase global income. 58 C. Political Globalization As economic globalization expands, it has been accompanied by a somewhat lesser degree of political globalization in that there are now substantial numbers of elected governments. 59 Also, the rhetoric of human rights has gained universal acceptance, and more nations than ever before have pledged to protect human rights. 60 With political globalization, there is &nbsp;~*448~ &nbsp;more than just the existence of elected governments and the recognition of human rights by governments. Political globalization has also tended to cause a convergence in political values, with the genuine acceptance of democracy and human rights in a greater number of countries. Compared to the convergence in economic values, the convergence of political values has had a more difficult path. The growth of economic globalization was championed by countries that realized they would gain economically by increased foreign trade. Even the command-economy communist nations sought trade with the capitalist economies of the West. 61 Well before the end of the Cold War, some communist nations even embraced capitalism to an extent. As events in China have clearly shown, dictatorship and a dismal human rights record have not been incompatible with free market policies. 62 Unlike economic globalization, the support for political globalization historically has been weak, perhaps because its benefits were not as obvious or immediate. Despite their long history predating free market principles, the political values of democracy and human rights have been more dishonored by breach than honored by observance. 63 Most countries did &nbsp;~*449~ &nbsp;not espouse them, and those that did applied these concepts selectively. 64 For decades after the end of World WarII, the spread of humanitarian political values had to contend with severe obstacles. 65 For much of the &nbsp;~*450~ &nbsp;existence of the United Nations, the most important international organization devoted to the promotion of democracy and human rights, many of its leading members either did not observe democratic values or human rights domestically, or subordinated these values to other priorities in foreign affairs. 66 Despite initial obstacles, however, these political values slowly developed roots in non-western countries. Even before the end of the Cold War, the past two decades saw the emergence of a greater number of countries with democratic governments and protective of human rights. 67 These countries offer political rights and &nbsp;~*451~ &nbsp;civil liberties that make them different in kind from past authoritarian regimes. With the end of the Cold War, many of the former Soviet-allied countries established popularly elected governments. Earlier, elected governments emerged from dictatorships in Latin America, Asia, and Africa. 68 As the transformation of South Africa - the former bastion of apartheid - into a democratic country shows, the unbelievable can happen. The outlook today is promising for the values of democracy and, to a lesser extent, human rights. First, with the triumph of liberal democracy over communism in the Cold War, 69 the United States and its allies can now more vigorously pursue humanitarian rather than security objectives. Second, the commonality of democracy and human rights in nations has provided more reason for these nations to cooperate among themselves in trade, humanitarian, and security matters, as well as in trying to nurture the qualities of democracy and human rights in authoritarian countries. The remaining authoritarian strongholds face pressures to democratize, and to recognize some level of human rights. 70 Democracy has been easier to achieve than the protection of human rights, perhaps because the implementation of democracy is technically more easily accomplished (e.g., a popularly elected government), while there may be disagreement over which rights are basic human rights and how these basic rights are to be protected. 71 Furthermore, elected governments need not necessarily protect human rights, especially in nascent &nbsp;~*452~ &nbsp;democracies which may have problems of illiteracy, corruption, authoritarian traditions, ethnic or religious conflicts, and a winner-takes-all political system. 72 The value of democratic governments is that their actions reflect the desires of a majority of the people rather than the wishes of a tyrant or a select few. Democracy is arguably the most basic human right because it recognizes the sovereignty of the people in that a government pursues policies which the majority of the people support through their freely elected representatives. The preferences of at least a majority of its population, rather than the desires of a select few, influence democratic governments. Democratic governments are much more likely to respect human rights, at least those of the majority, than authoritarian regimes which are unaccountable to an electorate. Of course, democracy is not itself a sufficient condition for a humane society, since a majority may persecute or subjugate a minority in a democratic society. 73 A practical benefit of mature democracies, those having democratic governments for a long period of time, is that they substantially protect a wide variety of human rights and are much less likely to use military force to resolve conflicts. 74 &nbsp;~*453~ &nbsp;Despite disagreement over the extent to which human rights should be protected, some level of human rights protection exists for a substantial percentage, if not the majority, of the world’s population. 75 For an increasing number of countries, there seems to be a real, as opposed to a rhetorical, acceptance of some form of human rights. While inadequate and imperfect, this is an enormous improvement over the past. While outrageous examples of inhumanity still occur, such as in Rwanda, they are universally condemned. &nbsp;In an indirect way, the cultural impact of economic globalization stimulates political globalization. Economic globalization has long introduced aspects of foreign cultures - especially American culture - either directly by the sale of merchandise such as movies and musical recordings, or indirectly through exposure to foreigners. 77 More than in the past, &nbsp;the opening of new markets through economic globalization has brought a flood of people and companies into foreign lands. Personal contact, always so important in understanding other human beings, has made foreigners less inscrutable. More business personnel are assigned to overseas offices, more consumers travel abroad as tourists, and more students study in foreign countries. 78 Local residents are more likely than ever before to work for, do business with, or personally know foreigners. In some cases, this transnational encounter may lead to a personal affinity with or an in-depth understanding of foreign cultures. 79 &nbsp;~*455~ &nbsp;Further, economic globalization has generated an interest in learning foreign languages, primarily English. Perhaps irreversibly, English has become the international language of business and science, with a broader usage than any other language. 80 At the same time, the ability to speak a foreign language other than English gives one a competitive advantage in doing business in nonEnglish-speaking countries. 81 Doing business with foreigners, in their country or in one’s own, requires that one communicate with them, cooperate with them, and be exposed to their political and business values. 82 The political values of democracy and human rights, as well as aspects of foreign cultures, are often inseparable (though secondary) components of economic globalization. Thus, countries that seek to benefit from economic globalization must frequently tolerate political globalization and exposure to foreign cultures. As people know more about foreign cultures, some familiarity with foreign political values is bound to arise. II. Technology’s Vital Role in Converging Values The advanced communication technology that links much of the world together continues to be crucial to the convergence of economic and political values. This technology is utilized primarily by business entities to facilitate economic globalization. 83 Modern technology has also tended to promote democracy and human rights by making it easier and cheaper for &nbsp;~*456~ &nbsp;people to communicate without censorship across national boundaries. Communication technology not only exposes a national population to foreign ideas, but also concurrently exposes domestic conditions to a global audience. qThis has occurred because economic globalization involves communication technologies with multiple uses. The same technology that transmits a business proposal may also communicate politically embarrassing or other non-business information. These multiple uses of advanced technology cannot easily be separated from each other, making it difficult to restrict the technology to purely business purposes. A country that wishes to participate in international business cannot isolate itself from all uses of communication technologies unrelated to business dealings. 84 The internet 85 is a recent communication medium with tremendous potential for linking people across national boundaries, furthering mutual interests of the international community, and a myriad of other uses. 86 The internet will become, or may already be, an important or even critical technological medium for business, as well as for scientific research and consumer enjoyment. 87 The internet is the essential part of the "informa- &nbsp;~*457~ &nbsp;tion superhighway," a source of information that promises to change fundamentally human lives. 88 E-mail and computer file transmission on the internet can potentially provide a more powerful (e.g., faster, cheaper, more convenient) business tool than such conventional devices as the postal service, telephones, and faxes. Internet users can transmit and download data, articles, images, movies, speeches, sound recordings, and other information. 89 By providing a forum for the transfer of such information, the internet will help protect the freedoms of expression and choice for followers of any ideological persuasion. 90 Unfortunately, however, it may shield criminal, obscene, &nbsp;~*458~ &nbsp;racist, and terrorist activities as well. 91 A government might attempt to control the content of information transfers. It could screen large numbers of telephone calls, faxes, or computer data; it could restrict access to or intercept messages on the internet. Total censorship, however, would bring a halt to international business. 92 Firms might object if government surveillance is too pervasive. For example, companies might not want government officials to be privy to proprietary information. 93 A certain amount of freedom of communication is therefore assured if a country wishes to be part of a global economy: international firms will leave a nation if censorship prohibitively increases the cost of doing business. This will remain true even if governments attempt to censor communications using the most advanced and cost-effective surveillance technology available. 94 &nbsp;~*459~ &nbsp;Communication technologies not essential to international business transactions also serve to bolster humanitarian political values. International news reporting utilizes communication technologies to broadcast major domestic events of all types on a worldwide screen. There are numerous journalists, broadcasters, and commentators whose professional livelihood depends upon bringing newsworthy stories to a foreign, if not international, audience. While most publicized stories may not involve political events, many do. The competitive members of the news media are unlikely to let stories of outrageous acts completely escape the attention of the international public. Furthermore, these news articles may be read by anyone in the world who has access to the internet. 95 At the same time, news stories alone would not generate international repercussions against repressive governments if purely theoretical political values were involved. There must be influential constituencies that place high priority on the existence of democracy and human rights, that seek to spread those values, and that are galvanized into action upon news of deplorable political conditions. Neither value would flourish unless there were constituencies, either domestic or abroad, that strongly supported it. The presence of democratic governments and strong protections for human rights in the industrialized countries means that these values are expressed to some degree in their business transactions with other countries. 96 Sizable populations in the industrialized countries also attempt to support democracy and human rights abroad through private means. 97 Moreover, as the living standards of developing countries improve, the citizenry of these countries seem to expect more democratization (first) and &nbsp;~*460~ &nbsp;human rights (later). 98 III. The Importance of Globalization Because globalization promotes common values across nations and can make foreign problems, conditions, issues, and debates as vivid and captivating as national, state, and local ones, it contributes to a sense of world community. 99 It develops a feeling of empathy for the conditions of people abroad, enlarging the group of human beings that an individual will identify with. Globalization thus helps to bring alive persons in foreign lands, making them fellow human beings who simply live in different parts of the world rather than abstract statistics of deaths, poverty, and suffering. The convergence of basic political and economic values is thus fundamentally important because it helps to establish a common bond among people in different countries, facilitating understanding and encouraging cooperation. All other things being equal, the commonality among countries - whether in the form of basic values, culture, or language - enhances their attractiveness to each other. 100 In addition, convergence increases the possibility that a transformation of attitude will take place for those who participate in transnational activities. People will begin to regard foreigners in distant lands with the same concern that they have for their fellow citizens. 101 They will endeavor to help these foreigners obtain basic political rights even though the status of political rights in other countries will have no tangible beneficial impact at home. 102 Convergence does not mean that there is a single model of a market economy, a single type of democracy, or a single platform of human rights. They exist in different forms, and nations may have different combinations of these forms. 103 &nbsp;~*462~ &nbsp;A. The Perspective of One Human Race The convergence of fundamental values through globalization has profound consequences because it increases the chance that a new perspective will develop, one which views membership in the human race as the most significant societal relationship, except for nationality. 104 A person owes his or her strongest collective loyalties to the various societies with which he or she most intensely identifies. Today, this societal identification can be based on numerous factors, including nationality, race, religion, and ethnic group. 105 While it is unlikely that nationality will be surpassed as the most significant societal relationship, globalization and the convergence of values may eventually convince people in different countries that the second most important social group is the human race, and not a person’s racial, religious, or ethnic group. 106 One of the first steps in the formation of a society is the recognition by prospective members that they have common interests and bonds. An essential commonality is that they share some fundamental values. A second is that they identify themselves as members belonging to the same community on the basis of a number of common ties, including shared fundamental values. A third commonality is the universality of rights - the active application of the "golden rule" - by which members expect that all must be entitled to the same rights as well as charged with the same responsibilities to ensure that these rights are protected. Globalization promotes these three types of commonalities. Globalization establishes common ground by facilitating the almost universal acceptance of market economies, the widespread emergence of democratic governments, and the extensive approval of human rights. The most visible example is economic. With the end of the Cold War, the free market economy has clearly triumphed over the command economy in the battle of the &nbsp;~*463~ &nbsp;economic paradigms. Because some variant of a market economy has taken root in virtually all countries, there has been a convergence of sorts in economic systems. 107 Further, because it often requires exposure to and pervasive interaction with foreigners - many of whom share the same fundamental values - globalization can enlarge the group that one normally identifies with. Globalization makes many of its participants empathize with the conditions and problems of people who in earlier years would have been ignored as unknown residents of remote locations. This empathy often leads to sympathy and support when these people suffer unfairly. Finally, the combination of shared values and identification produce the third commonality, universality of rights. 108 Citizens of one country will often expect, and work actively to achieve, the same basic values in other countries. They will treat nationals of other nations as they would wish to be treated. The effects of shared values, identification, and universality of rights in globalization could have a pivotal long-term effect - the possibility that a majority of human beings will begin to believe that they are truly part of a single global society - the human race. This is not to say that people disbelieve the idea that the human race encompasses all human beings. Of course, they realize that there is only one human species. Rather, the human race does not usually rank high on the hierarchy of societies for most people. Smaller societies, especially those based on nationality, race, religion, or ethnicity, command more loyalty. 109 The idea of the human race, the broadest and all-inclusive category of the human species, is abstract and has little, if any, impact on the lives of human beings. To believe in the singular importance of the human race requires an attitudinal shift in which a person views the human race seriously. &nbsp;~*464~ &nbsp;This may occur because the convergence of values does not only mean that the people of different countries will share the same basic values. It may also lead to the greater promotion of these values for the people of other countries. Historically and certainly today, America and the other industrial democracies have attempted to foster democracy and human rights in other countries. 110 While some part of this effort has been attributable to "self interest," it has also been due to the empathy that the industrialized democracies have had for other countries. 111 The magnitude of these efforts in the future, as in the past, will depend not solely upon the available financial and human resources of the industrialized democracies. It will also depend upon their national will - a factor undoubtedly influenced by the intensity with which the people of the industrialized democracies identify with people in foreign lands. The perspective that the human race matters more than its component divisions would accelerate cooperative efforts among nations to attack global problems that adversely affect human rights and the quality of human life. 112 Obviously, there is no shortage of such problems. Great suffering still occurs in so many parts of the world, not just from internal armed conflicts, 113 but also from conditions of poverty. 114 There are severe health problems in much of the world which can be mitigated with relatively little cost. 115 There are the lives lost to the AIDS epidemic, and &nbsp;~*465~ &nbsp;the deaths and disabilities caused by land mines. 116 Russia, a nuclear superpower that could end life on this planet, has severe social, economic, and political problems. 117 Making the human race important would not just promote liberal democratic values but would also reduce human suffering and perhaps eliminate completely the risk of nuclear war.. &nbsp;B. General Convergence of Values &nbsp;&nbsp;Assuming that the formation of a single human society is a possible outcome, two broad questions should be answered: what kind of human society is being created, and is this society desirable. The answer to the latter question will depend on an evaluator’s subjective judgment of the society that is being formed. Undoubtedly, the great majority of human beings would abhor a world society that was being created by the conquests of a totalitarian government. Presumably, most Americans (and many citizens of other countries) would reject even a benevolent, democratic global society in which a world government dominated by other countries dictated laws that governed the lives of all human beings. If either outcome were present, many would call for a halt to globalization. Thus the direction that globalization follows is critical for assessing its appeal. &nbsp;What globalization has brought is a general convergence of fundamental economic and political systems among many nations. These systems are not identical. There are still innumerable differences among countries with market economies, democratic governments, and respectful of human rights. n118 The practices of one country may be intolerable to another coun- &nbsp;~*466~ &nbsp;try. n119 Furthermore, it is unlikely and probably undesirable that economic and political systems will ever exactly converge. Nor is it foreseeable that the nations of the world will coalesce into one. &nbsp;Even among the industrialized democracies, there are enough dissimilarities in market economies, democratic governments, and attitudes towards human rights that make some believe that the differences between these nations outweigh the similarities. For example, Japan is frequently characterized as having a producer-oriented market economy, as compared with the consumer-oriented market economy of the United States. n120 In general, the members of the European Union more extensively regulate their economies than the United States, engaging at times in social engineering that seems contrary to market principles as interpreted by Americans. n121 In the area of criminal justice, the United States is virtually alone in permitting the death penalty and imprisons a much higher percentage &nbsp;~*467~ &nbsp;of its population than other industrialized democracies. n122 &nbsp;Nonetheless, the basic economic and political systems of different countries clearly share more similarities than ever before. When asked to characterize their existing economic and political systems, more people in more countries than ever before will respond that they have a "market" economy, that their government is "democratic," and that they protect "human rights." Importantly, the convergence of values seems to be accompanying the convergence of systems. Certainly, most people in the industrialized democracies would view their existing economic and political systems as expressing the foundational values of their societies - the values that define their society. n123 The convergence of values along liberal demo- &nbsp;~*468~ &nbsp;cratic lines means that nations are better situated to negotiate wealth-maximizing trade &nbsp;agreements and to resolve political disputes peacefully. &nbsp;But in countries in transition from authoritarian to liberal democracy, many people may not yet fully accept their newly established economic and political systems as reflecting fundamental values of what is correct, proper, or right. Whether these transitional countries continue to establish or possess liberal democracies will depend upon how well the systems of liberal democracy work, an outcome that the industrialized democracies should strive vigorously to achieve. Workable systems can evolve into entrenched values. &nbsp;Obviously, the implantation of the values of liberal democracy in Russia is of paramount concern. n124 Nurturing a democratic Russia is in the vital national interest of the United States (and the rest of the world) for very practical reasons - only Russia and the United States possess sufficient nuclear weapons to end human civilization. n125 Whether by unilateral or multilateral extensions of financial assistance or political inclusion, the industrialized democracies should do their utmost to make Russia a strong liberal democracy. Economic aid should be generous, and Russia should be incorporated into the activities of the industrialized democracies as much as possible. n126 &nbsp;Not all basic values are converging and nor, perhaps, should they. Religious values are not converging in the sense that the same general religion, such as Christianity, is taking root in a preponderance of countries. n127 Nevertheless, the convergence of economic and political values means that there is a greater basis for cooperation. For that reason, the &nbsp;~*469~ &nbsp;"West" n128 - that is, the United States and the other industrialized democracies - should support the process of value convergence. &nbsp;Sharing the same values creates similar expectations and a common ground for understanding. The more prevalent reliance upon market forces to direct production and consumption means that nations are more likely to trade with and invest in each other. The relative sameness of political values, for example, the prevelant use of negotiation rather than military force in settling disputes, means that nations can have greater trust in and less to fear from each other.The similarity of basic values also means that the different peoples of humanity are one step closer to viewing themselves primarily as part of one human society - the human race - though represented by different governments.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h3 id="HTurnsU.S.Leadership" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Turns U.S. Leadership</span></h3><h4 id="HGutsU.S.leadership" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Guts U.S. leadership</span></h4><p><strong>Bhat, 9/29</strong> (Devika, 9/29/2013, thetimes.co.uk, "US Government shutdown looms: Pentagon warns of national security threat," Factiva))<br/>Chuck Hagel slammed the congressional impasse as "an astoundingly irresponsible way to govern". <br/>AND<br/>ability to meet its debts on October 17 unless the limit is increased.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h3 id="HAT:ObamaWillRaiseDebtCeilingUnilaterally" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>AT: Obama Will Raise Debt Ceiling Unilaterally</span></h3><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HConstitutionalexpertsdisagree" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Constitutional experts disagree</span></h4><p><strong>Market Watch, 9/25&nbsp;</strong>("If all else fails, Obama will raise debt ceiling himself: analyst," 9/25/2013, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://blogs.marketwatch.com/capitolreport/2013/09/25/if-all-else-fails-obama-will-raise-debt-ceiling-himself-analyst/))  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://blogs.marketwatch.com/capitolreport/2013/09/25/if-all-else-fails-obama-will-raise-debt-ceiling-himself-analyst/))%27" tppabs="http://blogs.marketwatch.com/capitolreport/2013/09/25/if-all-else-fails-obama-will-raise-debt-ceiling-himself-analyst/))"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://blogs.marketwatch.com/capitolreport/2013/09/25/if-all-else-fails-obama-will-raise-debt-ceiling-himself-analyst/))</span></a></span><br/>Laurence Tribe, a noted professor of constitutional law at Harvard, tried at the <br/>AND<br/>the risk that the government might refuse to honor those debts as legitimate.</p><h4 id="HWillstillwreckU.S.economicleadership" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Will still wreck U.S. economic leadership</span></h4><p><strong>Drum, 9/25</strong> —- political blogger for Mother Jones (9/25/2013, Kevin, "If We Reach the Debt Limit, Obama Will Probably Just Break Through It Anyway," <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/09/obama-debt-ceiling-bond-auction))  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/09/obama-debt-ceiling-bond-auction))%27" tppabs="http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/09/obama-debt-ceiling-bond-auction))"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/09/obama-debt-ceiling-bond-auction))</span></a></span></p><p>What laws does the executive branch follow and which does it break?

Consider the events of Thursday morning:<br/>Obama gave a rousing speech in suburban Washington, in defense of Obamacare, on the eve of its implementation. "We’re now only five days away from finishing the job," he told the crowd.<br/>But before he had even left the room, his administration let slip that it was delaying by a month the sign-up for the health-care exchanges for small businesses. It wasn’t a huge deal, but it was enough to trample on the message the president had just delivered.<br/>Throughout his presidency, Obama has had great difficulty delivering a consistent message. Supporters <br/>AND<br/>they fear that Obama will change his mind and leave them standing alone.<br/>Now come the budget showdowns, which could define the rest of his presidency. Republican leaders are trying to shift the party’s emphasis from the fight over a government shutdown to the fight over the debt-limit increase, where they have more support. A new Bloomberg poll found that Americans, by a 2-to-1 margin, disagree with Obama’s view that Congress should raise the debt limit without any conditions.<br/>But Obama has a path to victory. That poll also found that Americans think lawmakers should stop trying to repeal Obamacare. And that was before House Republicans dramatically overplayed their hand by suggesting that they’ll allow the nation to default if Obama doesn’t agree to their laundry list of demands, including suspending Obamacare, repealing banking reforms, building a new oil pipeline, easing environmental regulations, limiting malpractice lawsuits and restricting access to Medicare.<br/>To beat the Republicans, Obama might follow the example of a Republican, George W. Bush. Whatever you think of what he did, he knew how to get it done: by simplifying his message and repeating it, ad nauseam, until he got the result he was after.<br/>Obama instead tends to give a speech and move along to the next topic. This is why he is forever making "pivots" back to the economy, or to health care. But the way to pressure Congress is to be President One Note.<br/>In the debt-limit fight, Obama already has his note: He will not negotiate over the full faith and credit of the United States. That’s as good a theme as any; it matters less what the message is than that he delivers it consistently.<br/>The idea, White House officials explained to me, is to avoid getting into a back-and-forth over taxes, spending and entitlement programs. "We’re right on the merits, but I don’t think we want to argue on the merits," one said. "Our argument is not that our argument is better than theirs; it’s that theirs is stupid."<br/>This is a clean message: Republicans are threatening to tank the economy — through a shutdown or, more likely, through a default on the debt — and Obama isn’t going to negotiate with these hostage-takers.<br/>Happily for Obama, Republicans are helping him to make the case by being publicly <br/>AND<br/>to snicker" as his colleague spoke — more smug teenager than legislator.<br/>Even if his opponents are making things easier for him, Obama still needs to stick to his message. As in Syria, the president has drawn a "red line" by saying he won’t negotiate with those who would put the United States into default. If he retreats, he will embolden his opponents and demoralize his supporters.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HCancelledAsiatripprovestheuniquenessandimportanceoffocus" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Cancelled Asia trip proves the uniqueness and importance of focus</span></h4><p><strong>Cohen, et. al, 10/4</strong> (Tom Cohen.

Plenty of folks are rightly skeptical about this development. But it’s not entirely without significance.<br/>The Post’s account points out that this may be a trial balloon designed to gauge how this will play with conservatives. Meanwhile, a spokesman for Boehner has been reiterating that Boehner does not intend to allow default, even as that spokesman is simultaneously reiterating that he will expect concessions in exchange for raising the debt limit, anyway. Why? Because a "clean" debt limit cannot pass the House.<br/>This is a variation on the glaring absurdity that’s been at the heart of Boehner’s <br/>AND<br/>in his caucus will need some goodies to get them to go along.<br/>Note these details from the Post’s write up:<br/>In a series of small-group meetings in his office suite, Boehner has <br/>AND<br/>than a majority of Republicans — to pass a debt-ceiling increase.<br/>What still needs to be nailed down is whether Boehner is prepared to allow a vote on a "clean" debt ceiling increase. Quotes from his spokespeople suggest not, but on the other hand, if a debt ceiling increase is going to pass with mostly Dems, it would have to be clean. More clarification here would be useful.<br/>More broadly, what seems to be going on here is that this is Boehner’s <br/>AND<br/>in exchange for GOP cooperation in returning us to something resembling governing normalcy.<br/>So in one sense, this isn’t much of a concession. On the other <br/>AND<br/>that’s always been at the heart of his position even more glaringly absurd.<br/>The twin warnings came from a Treasury Department report and a muscularly worded speech from President Obama, who said that unless Congress acted soon, ’’the whole world will have problems.’’</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h3 id="HAT:PCFails" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>AT: PC Fails</span></h3><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HNotresponsivetoourDA2014-theonlywayforObamatowinthedebtceilingbattleistostayonmessage2014-theplanclearlydivertshisattentionandmakeshimlookweakbyhavinghisauthoritystrippedaway." class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Not responsive to our DA —- the only way for Obama to win the debt ceiling battle is to stay on message —- the plan clearly diverts his attention and makes him look weak by having his authority stripped away.</span></h4><h4 id="HObamausingtimeandinfluencetogetbusinessgroupstohelpbuildsupportwithGOP" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Obama using time and influence to get business groups to help build support with GOP</span></h4><p><strong>Sink, 9/17</strong> (Justin, 9/17/2013, "Amid fiscal fights, Obama courting business leaders," <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/322883-amid-fiscal-fights-obama-courting-business-leaders))  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/322883-amid-fiscal-fights-obama-courting-business-leaders))%27" tppabs="http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/322883-amid-fiscal-fights-obama-courting-business-leaders))"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/322883-amid-fiscal-fights-obama-courting-business-leaders))</span></a></span><br/>President Obama will address the Business Roundtable (BRT) on Wednesday as he works <br/>AND<br/>said.

One way to answer this is to start from the proposition that if you believe the use of force in these circumstances is lawful and ethical, then all things being equal as an ethical matter, the method of force used should be the one that spares the most civilians while achieving its lawful aims. If that is the comparison of moral alternatives, there is simply no serious way to dispute that drone warfare is the best method available. It is more discriminating and more precise than other available means of air warfare, including manned aircraft—as France and Britain, lacking their own drones and forced to rely on far less precise manned jet strikes, found over Libya and Mali—and Tomahawk cruise missiles. A second observation is to look across the history of precision weapons in the past several decades. I started my career as a human-rights campaigner, kicking off the campaign to ban landmines for leading organizations. Around 1990, I had many conversations with military planners, asking them to develop more accurate and discriminating weapons—ones with smaller kinetic force and greater ability to put the force where sought. Although every civilian death is a tragedy, and drone warfare is very far from being the perfect tool the Obama administration sometimes suggests, for someone who has watched weapons development over a quarter century, the drone represents a steady advance in precision that has cut zeroes off collateral-damage figures. Those who see only the snapshot of civilian harm today are angered by civilian deaths. But barring an outbreak of world peace, it is foolish and immoral not to encourage the development and use of more sparing and exact weapons. One has only to look at the campaigns of the Pakistani army to see the alternatives in action. The Pakistani military for many years has been in a running war with its own Taliban and has regularly attacked villages in the tribal areas with heavy and imprecise airstrikes. A few years ago, it thought it had reached an accommodation with an advancing Taliban, but when the enemy decided it wanted not just the Swat Valley but Islamabad, the Pakistani government decided it had no choice but to drive it back. And it did, with a punishing campaign of airstrikes and rolling artillery barrages that leveled whole villages, left hundreds of thousands without homes, and killed hundreds. But critics do not typically evaluate drones against the standards of the artillery barrage of manned airstrikes, because their assumption, explicit or implicit, is that there is no call to use force at all. And of course, if the assumption is that you don’t need or should not use force, then any civilian death by drones is excessive. That cannot be blamed on drone warfare, its ethics or effectiveness, but on a much bigger question of whether one ought to use force in counterterrorism at all.</p><h4 id="HThealternativestodronesinPakistanarewayworse" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>The alternatives to drones in Pakistan are way worse</span></h4><p><strong>Fair 2010</strong> - Assistant Professor, Georgetown &nbsp;(August 2, C.

Since April 2009, many changes have occurred across the Pakistani social landscape albeit with variation across the expanse of its territory. First, the Pakistani Taliban (Tehreek-e-Taliban-e-Pakistan, TTP) made an enormous strategic blunder. Throughout the early months of 2009, the provincial officials of Khyber Pakhtoonkhwa as well as the central government were negotiating a so-called peace deal with the militants associated with the TTP operating in the settled area of Swat. By most accounts, Pakistanis as well as Swatis themselves embraced this as a viable option to diminish the violence and restore peace to this territory that had been riven by TTP violence. As the ink on the deal was drying, the TTP breached the agreement in April 2009 and overran the town of Buner, sitting to the immediate west of the Indus River. This had two effects. First, it persuaded those in Swat and elsewhere, who had previously supported the Taliban’s self-proclaimed campaign to restore good governance and provide access to justice, that the Taliban were not interested in peaceful coexistence and were in fact committed to violence and expansion of power. Second, the onslaught against Buner had a powerful impact upon Pakistani opinion about the intentions of the TTP militant. Pakistanis have long viewed the Indus as an important barrier dividing the Pakistani heartland, comprised primarily of the Punjab and which lies to the east of the Indus, and the "uncontrollable" land of the Pashtuns lying to the east of the Indus. For Pakistanis the unruliness of this area increases as you move from the so-called "settled" Pashtun areas of Khyber-Pakhtoonkhwa towards the west where the "unsettled" tribal belt abuts Afghanistan. When the TTP militants came to the border of the Indus, many Pakistanis who were confident that the TTP only wanted the "Pashtun areas," came to believed the TTP militants want of all of Pakistan. These apprehensions were confirmed and even intensified when Sufi Mohammad — a local leader of the TTP in Swat — convened a congregation in the Swat city of Mingora and denounced the Pakistani constitution, declaring that Islam cannot accommodate democracy and that western democracy in particular was a system of infidels that has divided Pakistani society. Robust military operations began thereafter, this time with the significant degree of support of the public and diminished opposition to the same. Some four million persons were displaced from Swat once the operation began. (The army encouraged this displacement to permit it freedom of action against the militants; although the exodus was ill-planned with only a few days notice.) During my recent two trips to Swat, the Swatis I met from the Mingora area are generally pleased with the army’s operation and are — for now — glad the army is in place. These Swatis see the army as the one organization that gets things done in contrast to the civil administration which has yet to re-establish itself after the militants drove out civil authorities. Amidst allegations that the army was indiscriminate in its use of force, some Pakistanis began arguing that Pakistan should have its own drones to allow Pakistani forces to have the same accuracy as US forces. Increasingly Pakistani officials are requesting that the United States provide drones or at least let them have a role in pulling the trigger. Advocates of Pakistani drones or increased command and control over U.S. drones note that armed drones have neither displaced millions of Pakistanis nor resulted in the destruction of homes on a large scale. Killing Whose Enemies? Killing Our Enemies The August 2009 killing of Baitullah Mehsud catalyzed another shift in the Pakistani discourse. This was the first drone strike that killed a Pakistani militant who was exclusively an enemy of Pakistan. As Baitullah Mehsud had no operational import for the U.S. mission in Afghanistan, Pakistan understood that the United States was finally employing its use of force to contend with Pakistan’s own internal foes. This shift in the drone debate is an important shift that few American interlocutors appreciate as they sustain a baseless narrative that is deaf to the realities across Pakistan. Drones went from being universally dismissed among Pakistanis as a horrific menace to an instrument of significantly and comparatively humane lethality relative to other options. American analysts would be better served by appreciating the developing nuances in the drone debate in Pakistan before seeking to undermine the best program that the United States and Pakistan have in their mutual war on terror. Both American and Pakistani governments can help foster a more constructive debate by owning the program and disclosing Pakistan’s ever-increasing cooperation to shape the debate by providing empirical data about the drones’ victims and their operational significance. Few Pakistanis in the FATA, Khyber Pakhtoonkhwa or elsewhere in Pakistan would disagree that the world is a better place without Baitullah Mehsud in it.</p></div></div></td><td>10/7/13</td></tr><tr><td style="width:100%; word-break:break-all; word-break:break-word;"><div><p><input onclick="saveEntry(49)" src="../../xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" tppabs="http://opencaselist13.paperlessdebate.com/xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" style="float:right;" title="Save" type="image" value="Save"></input>

Trade restrictions have steadily increased to block Iran’s lucrative petroleum export market as well as the country’s participation in the global banking system. All told, international sanctions have cost Iran over 24100 billion in lost oil profits alone.<br/>So called "carrot and stick" policies have long been fundamental to international diplomacy. The "stick" has been a sharp one, and has finally brought the Iranians to the negotiating table.<br/>During his September visit to the UN General Assembly in New York, Iranian President <br/>AND<br/>, all but ensuring that negotiations cannot be used as a delay tactic.<br/>Yet amid these positive signs that diplomacy is working, members of Congress have advocated for even more sanctions to be levied against Iran, specifically in the form of Senate Bill 1881, sponsored by Illinois Republican Mark Kirk and New Jersey Democrat Robert Menendez.<br/>New sanctions would torpedo the Vienna talks and reverse the diplomatic progress that has been made.<br/>Iranian officials have already promised to abandon negotiations if new sanctions are passed. Even our own allies, along with Russia and China, have opposed the move. Passing unilateral sanctions will splinter the fragile international coalition, needlessly antagonize Iranian negotiators, and make a violent conflict with Iran more likely. Diplomatic victory will only be achieved if the international community stands united before Iran.<br/>To this point, the Obama administration has avoided a vote on SB 1881 by threatening a veto of the bill, and the administration’s full court press to prevent Senate Democrats from supporting new sanctions has bought international negotiators time. Several influential Democrats, including Senator Richard Blumenthal from Connecticut, have agreed to postpone a vote on the bill, contingent on productive negotiations.<br/>Although legislation imposing new sanctions has been avoided thus far, the pressure on Congressional Democrats to act will intensify as talks in Vienna move forward. This round of negotiations is widely projected to be more difficult than the November deal, and inflammatory rhetoric from Tehran is likely. Nevertheless, sanctions are not the answer. Instead, we must continue to let diplomacy run its course.<br/>Sanctions have done their job by bringing Iran to the table. In return, Iran expects to be rewarded with sanctions relief. The passage of new trade restrictions would effectively withdraw the carrot, and hit Iran with another stick. Consider the negotiations over.<br/>The risks of delaying new sanctions is slight. The sanctions relief Iran is receiving <br/>AND<br/>to prevent Tehran from racing towards a nuclear weapon while negotiations are ongoing.<br/>At the same time, the benefits of successful diplomacy are immense, as a comprehensive deal would be a dramatic victory for U.S. non-proliferation efforts. Further, the dismantling of Iran’s nuclear program would significantly ease tensions between its two biggest rivals in the region, Israel and Saudi Arabia.<br/>Our congressional leaders must not be so confident as to think Iran is desperate for <br/>AND<br/>policy dominated by isolation from the West and an aggressive nuclear development program.<br/>Our senators are facing significant political pressure to resist multilateralism and pursue increased sanctions based on an uncompromising mistrust of Iran. But history judges leaders not upon their conformity with party politics, but upon the ultimate results they achieve. It’s time to negotiate with the Iranians on good faith, and begin the serious work of establishing a meaningful nuclear agreement that could signal the beginning of a new era in Iranian-Western relations.</p><p><strong>====Plan triggers defection of democratic allies====</strong><br/><strong>Loomis, 7</strong> —- Department of Government at Georgetown <br/>(3/2/2007, Dr. Andrew J.

But it is the legislation’s commitment to support an Israeli preventive strike against Iranian nuclear facilities that almost ensures the U.S. and Iran will come to blows. As Section 2b, part 5 of the draft mandates:<br/>If the Government of Israel is compelled to take military action in legitimate self-defense against Iran’s nuclear weapon program, the United States Government should stand with Israel and provide, in accordance with the law of the United States and the constitutional responsibility of Congress to authorize the use of military force, diplomatic, military, and economic support to the Government of Israel in its defense of its territory, people, and existence.<br/>Now, the legislation being pushed by Senators Mark Kirk (R-IL), <br/>AND<br/>March told a Christians United for Israel (CUFI) conference in July:<br/>"If nothing changes in Iran, come September, October, I will present a resolution that will authorize the use of military force to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear bomb."<br/>Graham would have plenty of company from the hardest of hard liners in his party. In August 2012, Romney national security adviser and pardoned Iran-Contra architect Elliott Abrams called for a war authorization in the pages of the Weekly Standard. And just two weeks ago, Norman Podhoretz used his Wall Street Journal op-ed to urge the Obama administration to "strike Iran now" to avoid "the nuclear war sure to come."<br/>But at the end of the day, the lack of an explicit AUMF in the Nuclear Weapon Free Iran Act doesn’t mean its supporters aren’t giving Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu de facto carte blanche to hit Iranian nuclear facilities. The ensuing Iranian retaliation against to Israeli and American interests would almost certainly trigger the commitment of U.S. forces anyway.<br/>Even if the Israelis alone launched a strike against Iran’s atomic sites, Tehran will almost certainly hit back against U.S. targets in the Straits of Hormuz, in the region, possibly in Europe and even potentially in the American homeland. Israel would face certain retaliation from Hezbollah rockets launched from Lebanon and Hamas missiles raining down from Gaza.<br/>That’s why former Bush Defense Secretary Bob Gates and CIA head Michael Hayden raising the <br/>AND<br/>10 years in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars combined.") The anticipated blowback?<br/>Serious costs to U.S. interests would also be felt over the longer term, we believe, with problematic consequences for global and regional stability, including economic stability. A dynamic of escalation, action, and counteraction could produce serious unintended consequences that would significantly increase all of these costs and lead, potentially, to all-out regional war.</p><h4 id="HIsraelistrikescausegreatpowerwarandcollapseglobaleconomy-2" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Israeli strikes cause great power war and collapse global economy</span></h4><p>Rafael <strong>Reuveny 10</strong>, PhD, Professor in the School of Public and Environmental Affairs at Indiana University, "Unilateral Strike on Iran could trigger world Depression", Op-ed distributed through McClatchy Newspaper Co, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.indiana.edu/~~spea/news/speaking_out/reuveny_on_unilateral_strike_Iran.shtml  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.indiana.edu/~~spea/news/speaking_out/reuveny_on_unilateral_strike_Iran.shtml%27" tppabs="http://www.indiana.edu/~~spea/news/speaking_out/reuveny_on_unilateral_strike_Iran.shtml"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.indiana.edu/~~spea/news/speaking_out/reuveny_on_unilateral_strike_Iran.shtml</span></a></span><br/>A unilateral Israeli strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities would likely have dire consequences, including <br/>AND<br/>likely protest and send weapons, but would probably not risk using force.<br/>¶ While no one has a crystal ball, leaders should be risk-averse when choosing war as a foreign policy tool.

class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>A terrorist nuclear attack, and even the use of nuclear weapons in response by the country attacked in the first place, would not necessarily represent the worst of the nuclear worlds imaginable. Indeed, there are reasons to wonder whether nuclear terrorism should ever be regarded as belonging in the category of truly existential threats. A contrast can be drawn here with the global catastrophe that would come from a massive nuclear exchange between two or more of the sovereign states that possess these weapons in significant numbers. Even the worst terrorism that the twenty-first century might bring would fade into insignificance alongside considerations of what a general nuclear war would have wrought in the Cold War period. And it must be admitted that as long as the major nuclear weapons states have hundreds and even thousands of nuclear weapons at their disposal, there is always the possibility of a truly awful nuclear exchange taking place precipitated entirely by state possessors themselves. But these two nuclear worlds—a non-state actor nuclear attack and a catastrophic interstate nuclear exchange—are not necessarily separable. It is just possible that some sort of terrorist attack, and especially an act of nuclear terrorism, could precipitate a chain of events leading to a massive exchange of nuclear weapons between two or more of the states that possess them. In this context, today’s and tomorrow’s terrorist groups might assume the place allotted during the early Cold War years to new state possessors of small nuclear arsenals who were seen as raising the risks of a catalytic nuclear war between the superpowers started by third parties. These risks were considered in the late 1950s and early 1960s as concerns grew about nuclear proliferation, the so-called n+1 problem. It may require a considerable amount of imagination to depict an especially plausible situation where an act of nuclear terrorism could lead to such a massive inter-state nuclear war. For example, in the event of a terrorist nuclear attack on the United States, it might well be wondered just how Russia and/or China could plausibly be brought into the picture, not least because they seem unlikely to be fingered as the most obvious state sponsors or encouragers of terrorist groups. They would seem far too responsible to be involved in supporting that sort of terrorist behavior that could just as easily threaten them as well. Some possibilities, however remote, do suggest themselves. For example, how might the United States react if it was thought or discovered that the fissile material used in the act of nuclear terrorism had come from Russian stocks, FN 40 and if for some reason Moscow denied any responsibility for nuclear laxity? The correct attribution of that nuclear material to a particular country might not be a case of science fiction given the observation by Michael May et al. that while the debris resulting from a nuclear explosion would be "spread over a wide area in tiny fragments, its radioactivity makes it detectable, identifiable and collectable, and a wealth of information can be obtained from its analysis: the efficiency of the explosion, the materials used and, most important … some indication of where the nuclear material came from."41 Alternatively, if the act of nuclear terrorism came as a complete surprise, and American officials refused to believe that a terrorist group was fully responsible (or responsible at all) suspicion would shift immediately to state possessors. Ruling out Western ally countries like the United Kingdom and France, and probably Israel and India as well, authorities in Washington would be left with a very short list consisting of North Korea, perhaps Iran if its program continues, and possibly Pakistan. But at what stage would Russia and China be definitely ruled out in this high stakes game of nuclear Cluedo? In particular, if the act of nuclear terrorism occurred against a backdrop of existing tension in Washington’s relations with Russia and/or China, and at a time when threats had already been traded between these major powers, would officials and political leaders not be tempted to assume the worst? Of course, the chances of this occurring would only seem to increase if the United States was already involved in some sort of limited armed conflict with Russia and/or China, or if they were confronting each other from a distance in a proxy war, as unlikely as these developments may seem at the present time. The reverse might well apply too: should a nuclear terrorist attack occur in Russia or China during a period of heightened tension or even limited conflict with the United States, could Moscow and Beijing resist the pressures that might rise domestically to consider the United States as a possible perpetrator or encourager of the attack? Washington’s early response to a terrorist nuclear attack on its own soil might also raise the possibility of an unwanted (and nuclear aided) confrontation with Russia and/or China. For example, in the noise and confusion during the immediate aftermath of the terrorist nuclear attack, the U.S. president might be expected to place the country’s armed forces, including its nuclear arsenal, on a higher stage of alert. In such a tense environment, when careful planning runs up against the friction of reality, it is just possible that Moscow and/or China might mistakenly read this as a sign of U.S. intentions to use force (and possibly nuclear force) against them. In that situation, the temptations to preempt such actions might grow, although it must be admitted that any preemption would probably still meet with a devastating response. As part of its initial response to the act of nuclear terrorism (as discussed earlier) Washington might decide to order a significant conventional (or nuclear) retaliatory or disarming attack against the leadership of the terrorist group and/or states seen to support that group. Depending on the identity and especially the location of these targets, Russia and/or China might interpret such action as being far too close for their comfort, and potentially as an infringement on their spheres of influence and even on their sovereignty. One far-fetched but perhaps not impossible scenario might stem from a judgment in Washington that some of the main aiders and a betters of the terrorist action resided somewhere such as Chechnya, perhaps in connection with what Allison claims is the "Chechen insurgents’ … long-standing interest in all things nuclear."42 American pressure on that part of the world would almost certainly raise alarms in Moscow that might require a degree of advanced consultation from Washington that the latter found itself unable or unwilling to provide. There is also the question of how other nuclear-armed states respond to the act of nuclear terrorism on another member of that special club. It could reasonably be expected that following a nuclear terrorist attack on the United States, both Russia and China would extend immediate sympathy and support to Washington and would work alongside the United States in the Security Council. But there is just a chance, albeit a slim one, where the support of Russia and/or China is less automatic in some cases than in others. For example, what would happen if the United States wished to discuss its right to retaliate against groups based in their territory? If, for some reason, Washington found the responses of Russia and China deeply underwhelming, (neither "for us or against us") might it also suspect that they secretly were in cahoots with the group, increasing (again perhaps ever so slightly) the chances of a major exchange. If the terrorist group had some connections to groups in Russia and China, or existed in areas of the world over which Russia and China held sway, and if Washington felt that Moscow or Beijing were placing a curiously modest level of pressure on them, what conclusions might it then draw about their culpability? If Washington decided to use, or decided to threaten the use of, nuclear weapons, the responses of Russia and China would be crucial to the chances of avoiding a more serious nuclear exchange. They might surmise, for example, that while the act of nuclear terrorism was especially heinous and demanded a strong response, the response simply had to remain below the nuclear threshold. It would be one thing for a non-state actor to have broken the nuclear use taboo, but an entirely different thing for a state actor, and indeed the leading state in the international system, to do so. If Russia and China felt sufficiently strongly about that prospect, there is then the question of what options would lie open to them to dissuade the United States from such action: and as has been seen over the last several decades, the central dissuader of the use of nuclear weapons by states has been the threat of nuclear retaliation. If some readers find this simply too fanciful, and perhaps even offensive to contemplate, it may be informative to reverse the tables. Russia, which possesses an arsenal of thousands of nuclear warheads and that has been one of the two most important trustees of the non-use taboo, is subjected to an attack of nuclear terrorism. In response, Moscow places its nuclear forces very visibly on a higher state of alert and declares that it is considering the use of nuclear retaliation against the group and any of its state supporters. How would Washington view such a possibility? Would it really be keen to support Russia’s use of nuclear weapons, including outside Russia’s traditional sphere of influence? And if not, which seems quite plausible, what options would Washington have to communicate that displeasure? If China had been the victim of the nuclear terrorism and seemed likely to retaliate in kind, would the United States and Russia be happy to sit back and let this occur? In the charged atmosphere immediately after a nuclear terrorist attack, how would the attacked country respond to pressure from other major nuclear powers not to respond in kind? The phrase "how dare they tell us what to do" immediately springs to mind. Some might even go so far as to interpret this concern as a tacit form of sympathy or support for the terrorists. This might not help the chances of nuclear restraint. FN 40. One way of reducing, but probably not eliminating, such a prospect, is further international cooperation on the control of existing fissile material holdings.</span></h4><h4 id="HAfricaninstabilitywillescalate" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>African instability will escalate</span></h4><p>Glick 7, Middle East fellow at the Center for Security Policy, Condi’s African holiday,<span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.carolineglick.com/e/2007/12/condis-african-holiday.php?pf=yes  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.carolineglick.com/e/2007/12/condis-african-holiday.php?pf=yes%27" tppabs="http://www.carolineglick.com/e/2007/12/condis-african-holiday.php?pf=yes"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.carolineglick.com/e/2007/12/condis-african-holiday.php?pf=yes</span></a></span> <br/>The Horn of Africa is a dangerous and strategically vital place.

Executive Signaling: Law and Mechanisms<br/>We suggest that the executive’s credibility problem can be solved by second-order mechanisms <br/>AND<br/>-motivated actors. Commitments themselves have value as signals of benign motivations.<br/>This departs from the usual approach in legal scholarship. Legal theory has often discussed <br/>AND<br/>he can generate support from the public and other members of the government.<br/>Furthermore, our question is subconstitutional; it is whether a well-motivated executive<br/>AND<br/>in actions that are less costly for good types than for bad types.<br/>We begin with some relevant law; then examine a set of possible mechanisms, emphasizing both the conditions under which they might succeed and the conditions under which they might not; and then examine the costs of credibility.<br/>A. A Preliminary Note on Law and Self-Binding<br/>Many of our mechanisms are unproblematic from a legal perspective, as they involve presidential <br/>AND<br/>new political coalitions that will act to defend the new rules or policies.<br/>More schematically, we may speak of formal and informal means of self-binding:<br/>(1) The president might use formal means to bind himself. This is possible in the sense that an executive order, if otherwise valid, legally binds the president while it is in effect and may be enforced by the courts. It is not possible in the sense that the president can always repeal the executive order if he can bear the political and reputational costs of doing so.<br/>(2) The president might use informal means to bind himself. This is <br/>AND<br/>as a breach of faith even if no other institution ever enforces it.<br/>In what follows, we will invoke both formal and informal mechanisms. For our <br/>AND<br/>ones, it does not matter whether the constraint is formal or informal.<br/>B. Mechanisms<br/>What signaling mechanisms might a well-motivated executive adopt to credibly assure voters, <br/>AND<br/>– but it is not explained why the constitutional order should be fractal.<br/>Second, Katyal’s proposals for internal separation of powers are self-defeating: the <br/>AND<br/>ensures that the proposals are not self-defeating, whatever their costs.<br/>The contrast here must not be drawn too simply. A well-motivated executive<br/>AND<br/>have no incentive to adopt proposals intended to constrain that sort of actor.<br/>Independent commissions. We now turn to some conceptually coherent mechanisms of executive signaling. Somewhat analogously to Katyal’s idea of the internal separation of powers, a well-motivated executive might establish independent commissions to review policy decisions, either before or after the fact. Presidents do this routinely, especially after a policy has had disastrous outcomes, but sometimes beforehand as well. Independent commissions are typically blue-ribbon and bipartisan.82<br/>We add to this familiar process the idea that the President might gain credibility by <br/>AND<br/>the costs of wiggling out even if they do not completely prevent it.<br/>Consider whether George W. Bush’s credibility would have been enhanced had he appointed a <br/>AND<br/>-motivated executive to credibly distinguish himself from the ill-motivated one.<br/>The more common version of this tactic is to appoint commissions after the relevant event<br/>AND<br/>a plausible inference that the president’s future behavior will track his past behavior.<br/>Bipartisan appointments. In examples of the sort just mentioned, the signaling arises from <br/>AND<br/>to commit to giving the agency some autonomy from the president’s preferences.86<br/>Similar mechanisms can work even where no statutes are in the picture. As previously <br/>AND<br/>which in turn encourages broader delegations of discretion from the public and Congress.<br/>A commitment to bipartisanship is only one way in which appointments can generate credibility. <br/>AND<br/>that the president will not deviate (too far) from their preferences.<br/>The Independent Counsel Statute institutionalized the special prosecutor and strengthened it. But the statute <br/>AND<br/>viewpoints is harder to ignore, if the members agree with each other.<br/>More generally, the decision by presidents to bring into their administrations members of other <br/>AND<br/>the existence of the program(s) was revealed to the public.<br/>Counter-partisanship. Related to bipartisanship is what might be called counterpartisanship: presidents <br/>AND<br/>enemy combatants, but not when he creates a massive prescription drug benefit.<br/>Counter-partisanship can powerfully enhance the president’s credibility, but it depends heavily on <br/>AND<br/>who opposed the Mexican War). But a nation is not always lucky.<br/>Transparency. The well-motivated executive might commit to transparency, as a way <br/>AND<br/>first place, and the public can therefore draw an inference to credibility.<br/>Credibility is especially enhanced when transparency is effected through journalists with reputations for integrity or <br/>AND<br/>in signaling in the present through (the threat of) future transparency.<br/>There are complex tradeoffs here, because transparency can have a range of harmful effects<br/>AND<br/>who give them access by portraying their decisionmaking in a favorable light.97<br/>We will take up the costs of credibility shortly.98 In general, however, the existence of costs does not mean that the credibility-generating mechanisms are useless. Quite the contrary: where the executive uses such mechanisms, voters and legislators can draw an inference that the executive is well-motivated, precisely because the existence of costs would have given an ill-motivated executive an excuse not to use those mechanisms.<br/>Multilateralism. Another credibility-generating mechanism for the executive is to enter into alliances <br/>AND<br/>and#34;wag the dogand#34; tactic intended to distract attention from Clinton’s impeachment.<br/>A public commitment to multilateralism can close or narrow the credibility gap.<br/>Suppose that a group of nations have common interests on one dimension – say, <br/>AND<br/>infer that interventions that gain multilateral approval do not rest on disreputable motives.<br/>It follows that multilateralism can be either formal or informal. Action by the United <br/>AND<br/>that there is no nefarious motive behind an intervention, should one occur.<br/>It also follows that multilateralism and bipartisan congressional authorization may be substitutes, in terms <br/>AND<br/>Nations Security Council rather than congressional authorization to prosecute the Korean War.99<br/>The costs of multilateralism are straightforward. Multilateralism increases the costs of reaching decisions, <br/>AND<br/>president who does pursue multilateralism is more likely to be well-motivated. <br/>Strict liability. For completeness, we mention that the well-motivated executive might <br/>AND<br/>is doing, and what the costs and benefits of the alternatives are.<br/>Here the credibility gap might be narrowed by creating a cause of action, for <br/>AND<br/>(even unintentional and non-negligent) surveillance of purely domestic communications.<br/>However, there are legal and practical problems here, perhaps insuperable ones.

On Tuesday, The New York Times revealed who was actually making the final decision on the biggest killings and drone strikes: President Obama himself. And that is very troubling. <br/>Mr. Obama has demonstrated that he can be thoughtful and farsighted, but, like all occupants of the Oval Office, he is a politician, subject to the pressures of re-election. No one in that position should be able to unilaterally order the killing of American citizens or foreigners located far from a battlefield — depriving Americans of their due-process rights — without the consent of someone outside his political inner circle.<br/>How can the world know whether the targets chosen by this president or his successors <br/>AND<br/>charge of weakness — built up a tough-sounding list of kills?<br/>It is too easy to say that this is a natural power of a commander in chief. The United States cannot be in a perpetual war on terror that allows lethal force against anyone, anywhere, for any perceived threat. That power is too great, and too easily abused, as those who lived through the George W. Bush administration will remember.<br/>Mr. Obama, who campaigned against some of those abuses in 2008, should remember. But the Times article, written by Jo Becker and Scott Shane, depicts him as personally choosing every target, approving every major drone strike in Yemen and Somalia and the riskiest ones in Pakistan, assisted only by his own aides and a group of national security operatives. Mr. Obama relies primarily on his counterterrorism adviser, John Brennan.<br/>To his credit, Mr. Obama believes he should take moral responsibility for these decisions, and he has read the just-war theories of Augustine and Thomas Aquinas.<br/>The Times article points out, however, that the Defense Department is currently killing <br/>AND<br/>an extraordinarily low civilian death rate that smells more of expediency than morality.<br/>In a recent speech, Mr. Brennan said the administration chooses only those who <br/>AND<br/>far lower standards. Without written guidelines, they can be freely reinterpreted.<br/>A unilateral campaign of death is untenable. To provide real assurance, President Obama should publish clear guidelines for targeting to be carried out by nonpoliticians, making assassination truly a last resort, and allow an outside court to review the evidence before placing Americans on a kill list. And it should release the legal briefs upon which the targeted killing was based.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HObamaissuingadirectivetoconsolidateauthorityintheDODwillcreatetransparency" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Obama issuing a directive to consolidate authority in the DOD will create transparency</span></h4><p><strong>Zenko</strong>, <strong>13</strong> —- Douglas Dillon Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations<strong>&nbsp;</strong><br/>(April, Transferring CIA Drone Strikes to the Pentagon, www.cfr.org/drones/transferring-cia-drone-strikes-pentagon/<span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://opencaselist13.paperlessdebate.com/bin/Cal+Berkeley/p30434-http://www.cfr.org/drones/transferring-cia-drone-strikes-pentagon/p30434)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path excluded from retrieval by the project\%27s Exclusions properties.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://opencaselist13.paperlessdebate.com/bin/Cal+Berkeley/p30434-http://www.cfr.org/drones/transferring-cia-drone-strikes-pentagon/p30434)%27" tppabs="http://opencaselist13.paperlessdebate.com/bin/Cal+Berkeley/p30434-http://www.cfr.org/drones/transferring-cia-drone-strikes-pentagon/p30434)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">p30434-http://www.cfr.org/drones/transferring-cia-drone-strikes-pentagon/p30434)</span></a></span></p><p>The main obstacle to acknowledging the scope, legality, and oversight of U.<br/>AND<br/>consolidates lead executive authority for planning and conducting nonbattlefield targeted killings under DOD.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HPresidentialcreationofaTaskforcesolvesforeignblowbackfromciviliancasualtiesandavoidspoliticalbacklash" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Presidential creation of a Task force solves foreign blowback from civilian casualties and avoids political backlash</span></h4><p><strong>Second Lieutenant Groves, 10</strong> (Brendan —- an educational delay student at Yale Law School, J.D. expected 2010, The Air Force Law Review, and#34;ARTICLE: CIVIL-MILITARY COOPERATION IN CIVILIAN CASUALTY INVESTIGATIONS: LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE AZIZABAD ATTACK,and#34; 65 A.F.

"The idea was that the outriggers would swing out from the EKV extending the reach of the EKV across a wider area of space," he said. "That way, if a conventional EKV would have missed the target by, say, a few yards, the outriggers might still hit the target."<br/>Another option would be an "umbrella-like structure" around the EKV, the former Pentagon official said, adding, "basically, the concept is to turn near misses into hits."<br/>But there are missile defense experts who say the only way for the ground-based missile defense system to work dependably would be to use nuclear-tipped interceptors, according to Coyle. These experts argue that "with pure hit-to-kill, and with little or no advance information about the details in such an attack, the miss distances will always be too large," he continued.<br/>The United States briefly deployed an anti-ballistic missile system in the mid-1970s called Safeguard that used nuclear-armed interceptors.<br/>"Trying to hit an enemy warhead out in space is like trying to hit a hole-in-one in golf, when the hole is going 15,000 miles per hour," Coyle said. "And if the enemy uses countermeasures or decoys, then it’s like hitting a hole-in-one when the hole is going 15,000 ~miles per hour~ and the green is covered with spots that look just like the holes.<br/>"With nuclear-tipped interceptors, the proponents would argue, all you need to do is get close to the golf course," he said.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HEffectivemissiledefenseiskeytopreventterrorismthatwilllimitU.S.leadershipanddetonateWMD" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Effective missile defense is key to prevent terrorism that will limit U.S. leadership and detonate WMD</span></h4><p><strong>Kennedy President Missile Threat ’3</strong><br/>(Brian T.-, missilethreat.com a Claremont Institute National Security Project, Jan. 3, Claremont Institute, "Understanding the Need for a National Missile Defense After 9-11", <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://missilethreat.eresources.ws/publications/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://missilethreat.eresources.ws/publications/%27" tppabs="http://missilethreat.eresources.ws/publications/"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://missilethreat.eresources.ws/publications/</span></a></span> id.6/puby detail.asp; Jacob)</p><p>On September 11, our nation’s enemies attacked us using hijacked airliners.

Meanwhile, its enthusiasm for missile defense remains as unbounded as it is unfathomable.<br/>Combine these two enthusiasms and—voila—you might produce a workable system, particularly if you throw tens of billions of dollars at it.<br/>After all, even true-blue believers in arms control like me have to admit that over time the Clinton-Bush missile defense people have demonstrated that they can get interceptors pretty close to incoming warheads, at least part of the time. And they will undoubtedly get better. The problem is that with a hit-to-kill system, close is not goodenough. Miss by an inch, miss by a mile; it makes no difference.<br/>With a micro-nuke, though, a near miss could do the job. A micro-nuke ought to be able to vaporize an entire threat cloud. And because it would produce much less radiation than larger warheads, it might not indiscriminately disable satellites in orbit.</p></div></div></td><td>11/21/13</td></tr><tr><td style="width:100%; word-break:break-all; word-break:break-word;"><div><p><input onclick="saveEntry(83)" src="../../xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" tppabs="http://opencaselist13.paperlessdebate.com/xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" style="float:right;" title="Save" type="image" value="Save"></input>

Since well before the district court issued its order that petitioners be brought to and released in the United States, the United States has undertaken extensive diplomatic efforts to resettle the Uighurs at Guantanamo Bay. Before January 20, 2009, Executive Branch officials approached a substantial number of countries concerning the Uighurs’ resettlement, recognizing that those efforts were laying the groundwork for a potentially lengthy dialogue with other nations. Later, consistent with the President’s directives in Executive Order No. 13,492, 74 Fed. Reg. 4897 (2009), the Secretary of State appointed a Special Envoy, Daniel Fried, to intensify diplomatic efforts to repatriate or resettle individuals cleared for transfer from Guantanamo Bay. Since accepting his appointment, Ambassador Fried has regularly traveled abroad to meet with representatives of other nations and discuss transfers of Guantanamo Bay detainees. He has focused his efforts on resettling detainees whom the United States could not send to their home countries because of concerns about possible torture, and has made resettlement of the Uighurs a top diplomatic priority. See U.S. Br. 3-4, 8-10 These diplomatic efforts had met with considerable success even before the Court granted certiorari. In May 2006, the five Uighurs whose CSRTs determined that they should no longer be detained were resettled in Albania. In June 2009, four Uighurs were resettled in Bermuda. And in September 2009, Palau offered to accept 12 of the 13 Uighurs remaining at Guantanamo Bay. Six of those 12 accepted Palau’s offer and were resettled there in October 2009 (after this Court’s grant of certiorari). The remaining six (including the five who will be left at Guantanamo Bay after Mr. Mahmud and Mr. Mahnut go to Switzerland) did not accept that offer. U.S. Br. 5, 9-10. Since the Court granted certiorari, the government of Switzerland agreed to accept the one Uighur detainee who had not previously received an offer, as well as his brother; they have accepted that offer and are expected to be resettled in Switzerland in the near future. U.S. Br. 10. And as noted in the government’s brief (at 10), the five other Uighurs who remain at Guantanamo Bay also received an offer from a country other than Palau; they did not accept that offer, and it was withdrawn after several months. If petitioners were to express interest, the United States would again discuss the matter with the government of Palau. Earlier this month, the President of Palau publicly announced that Palau remains receptive to resettling the Uighurs who remain at Guantanamo Bay, and has reiterated that the Uighur transferees are welcome to stay indefinitely. See Palau Willing to Take Remaining Guantanamo Uighurs (Feb. 8, 2010) <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20100209/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20100209/%27" tppabs="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20100209/"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20100209/</span></a></span> wl_asia_afp/uschinaxinjiangguantanamopalaujustice; see U.S. Br. 19 n.24. The United States also continues to work to find other options for resettlement. U.S. Br. 52. The government’s success in obtaining resettlement offers for all of the Uighurs at Guantanamo Bay is part of a broader pattern. Over the past year, 48 individuals have been transferred from Guantanamo Bay to nine different countries. U.S. Br. 4. And just several days ago, Spain agreed to accept five detainees. See Peter Finn, Spain to Accept Five Guantanamo Detainees, Wash. Post, Feb. 16, 2010 <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.washingtonpost.com/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.washingtonpost.com/%27" tppabs="http://www.washingtonpost.com/"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.washingtonpost.com/</span></a></span> wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/15/AR2010021501746.html. In particular, all 11 of the detainees in addition to the Uighurs who have obtained habeas orders of release that are final and not subject to appeal have been transferred. U.S. Br. 15. 4. These developments undermine not only the factual premise of the question on which this Court granted review, but the premise of petitioners’ arguments throughout the entirety of the relevant proceedings in this case. As explained above, petitioners consistently have argued that, because no other nation would accept them, their remedy of release from Guantanamo Bay could only be effective if a federal court were to order the Executive to bring them into the United States and release them here. But to the extent this might have appeared to be the case once, it is not the case now. All of the Uighurs who were once in military detention in an enemy status at Guantanamo Bay have either been resettled elsewhere, accepted an offer of resettlement (with resettlement soon to follow), or received two offers of resettlement but chosen not to accept them. And the five in the last category would likely still have the option of resettling in Palau if they expressed sufficient interest for the United States to again approach and engage in substantive discussions with the Palauan government. Or these five may benefit from the United States’ ongoing diplomatic efforts to resettle them elsewhere. In sum, all of the petitioners have had an option for release from custody other than a judicial order of release into the United States. The question upon which the Court granted certiorari is therefore no longer presented as to any petitioner, because release into the United States has not been the "only possible effective remedy."

Rather, we may pose the greatest threat to ourselves: the price we pay for making nuclear weapons the "supreme priority" carries a hefty price in money and in lives. Graham Allison, Joseph Cirincione and William Potter weigh in. Mueller has the last word.<br/>The Three "Nos" Knows<br/>Graham Allison<br/>"RADIOACTIVE HYPE" by John Mueller sharpens the barbs from his recent book, Overblown, in ways that demonstrate that he is, above all, a committed contrarian. One can agree with many points in his article and book. But his central propositions about the danger and appropriate responses to terrorism, nuclear terrorism and the proliferation of nuclear weapons are profoundly mistaken. Specifically, "Radioactive Hype" argues that:<br/>–"Threat-mongers"—for which the 9/11 Commission, my book Nuclear Terrorism: The Ultimate Preventable Catastrophe and presidential candidates of both parties are the poster children—have greatly exaggerated the threat of terrorists exploding a nuclear weapon in one of our cities.<br/>–An "obsessive quest to control nuclear proliferation—particularly since the end of the Cold War—has been substantially counterproductive."<br/>–This "nuclear obsession" drove the United States into "the current disastrous Iraq War" and now threatens war with Iran.<br/>Given the space allotted, my response to each proposition must be abridged but will reference my earlier work on this topic and other analyses from the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, where these issues are addressed in greater depth.1<br/>How Serious is the Threat of Nuclear Terrorism?<br/>MUELLER IS entitled to his opinion that the threat of nuclear proliferation and nuclear terrorism <br/>AND<br/>attack are relatively insignificant when considering how we should respond to the threat.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h3 id="H2NCATLinkturns" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>2NC AT Link turns</span></h3><h4 id="HTHEAFFRESULTSINCATASTROPHICTERRORISM" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>THE AFF RESULTS IN CATASTROPHIC TERRORISM</span></h4><p>Jack <strong>Goldsmith 9</strong>, Henry L.

To set up his discussion of praxis and the<br/>importance of and#34;namingand#34; the world, he outlines what he assumes to be<br/>shared, commonsensical beliefs about humans and other animals. He<br/>defines the boundaries of human membership according to a sharp, hierarchical dichotomy that establishes human superiority. Humans alone, he<br/>reminds us, are aware and self-conscious beings who can act to fulfill the<br/>objectives they set for themselves. Humans alone are able to infuse the<br/>world with their creative presence, to overcome situations that limit them,<br/>and thus to demonstrate a and#34;decisive attitude towards the worldand#34; (p. 90). Freire (1990, pp. 87–91) represents other animals in terms of their lack of<br/>such traits. They are doomed to passively accept the given, their lives<br/>and#34;totally determinedand#34; because their decisions belong not to themselves but<br/>to their species. Thus whereas humans inhabit a and#34;worldand#34; which they create<br/>and transform and from which they can separate themselves, for animals<br/>there is only habitat, a mere physical space to which they are and#34;organically<br/>bound.and#34;<br/>To accept Freire’s assumptions is to believe that humans are animals<br/>only in a nominal sense. We are different not in degree but in kind, and<br/>though we might recognize that other animals have distinct qualities, we<br/>as humans are somehow more unique. We have the edge over other creatures because we are able to rise above monotonous, species-determined<br/>biological existence. Change in the service of human freedom is seen to be<br/>our primary agenda. Humans are thus cast as active agents whose very<br/>essence is to transform the world – as if somehow acceptance, appreciation,<br/>wonder, and reverence were beyond the pale.<br/>This discursive frame of reference is characteristic of critical pedagogy.<br/>The human/animal opposition upon which it rests is taken for granted, its<br/>cultural and historical specificity not acknowledged. And therein lies the<br/>problem. Like other social constructions, this one derives its persuasiveness<br/>from its and#34;seeming facticity and from the deep investments individuals and<br/>communities have in setting themselves off from othersand#34; (Britzman et al.,<br/>1991, p. 91). This becomes the normal way of seeing the world, and like<br/>other discourses of normalcy, it limits possibilities of taking up and confronting inequities (see Britzman, 1995). The primacy of the human enterprise is simply not questioned.<br/>Precisely how an anthropocentric pedagogy might exacerbate the environmental crisis has not received much consideration in the literature<br/>of critical pedagogy, especially in North America. Although there may be<br/>passing reference to planetary destruction, there is seldom mention of the<br/>relationship between education and the domination of nature, let alone any<br/>sustained exploration of the links between the domination of nature and<br/>other social injustices. Concerns about the nonhuman are relegated to<br/>environmental education. And since environmental education, in turn,<br/>remains peripheral to the core curriculum (A. Gough, 1997; Russell, Bell,<br/>26 Fawcett, 2000), anthropocentrism passes unchallenged. S OF A CRITIQUE<br/>Bowers (1993a, 1993b) has identified a number of root metaphors or and#34;analogsand#34; in critical pedagogy that reinforce the problem of anthropocentric<br/>thinking. These include the notion of change as inherently progressive, faith in the power of rational thought, and an understanding of individuals<br/>as and#34;potentially free, voluntaristic entities who will take responsibility for<br/>creating themselves when freed from societal forms of oppressionand#34; (1993a,<br/>pp. 25–26). Such assumptions, argues Bowers, are part of the Enlightenment legacy on which critical pedagogy, and indeed liberal education<br/>generally, is based. In other words, they are culturally specific and stem<br/>from a period in Western history when the modern industrial world view<br/>was beginning to take shape.<br/>To be fair, Bowers understates the extent to which these assumptions are<br/>being questioned within critical pedagogy (e.g., Giroux, 1995; Peters, 1995;<br/>Shapiro, 1994; Weiler 26 Mitchell, 1992, pp. 1, 5). Nevertheless, his main<br/>point is well taken: proponents of critical pedagogy have yet to confront<br/>the ecological consequences of an educational process that reinforces beliefs<br/>and practices formed when unlimited economic expansion and social<br/>progress seemed promised (Bowers, 1993b, p. 3). What happens when the<br/>expansion of human possibilities is equated with the possibilities of consumption? How is educating for freedom predicated on the exploitation of<br/>the nonhuman? Such queries push against taken-for-granted understandings of human, nature, self, and community, and thus bring into focus the<br/>underlying tension between and#34;freedomand#34; as it is constituted within critical<br/>pedagogy and the limits that emerge through consideration of humans’<br/>interdependence with the more-than-human world.<br/>This tension is symptomatic of anthropocentrism. Humans are assumed<br/>to be free agents separate from and pitted against the rest of nature, our<br/>fulfillment predicated on overcoming material constraints. This assumption<br/>of human difference and superiority, central to Western thought since<br/>Aristotle (Abram, 1996, p. 77), has long been used to justify the exploitation<br/>of nature by and for humankind (Evernden, 1992, p. 96). It has also been<br/>used to justify the exploitation of human groups (e.g., women, Blacks,<br/>queers, indigenous peoples) deemed to be closer to nature – that is,<br/>animalistic, irrational, savage, or uncivilized (Gaard, 1997; Haraway, 1989,<br/>p. 30; Selby, 1995, pp. 17–20; Spiegel, 1988).<br/>This and#34;organic apartheidand#34; (Evernden, 1992, p. 119) is bolstered by the<br/>belief that language is an exclusively human property that elevates mere<br/>biological existence to meaningful, social existence. Understood in this<br/>way, language undermines our embodied sense of interdependence with<br/>a more-than-human world. Rather than being a point of entry into the webs<br/>of communication all around us, language becomes a medium through<br/>which we set ourselves apart and above.<br/>This view of language is deeply embedded in the conceptual framework<br/>of critical pedagogy, including poststructuralist approaches. So too is the<br/>human/nature dichotomy upon which it rests. When writers assume that and#34;it is language that enables us to think, speak and give meaning to the<br/>world around us,and#34; that and#34;meaning and consciousness do not exist outside<br/>languageand#34; (Weedon, 1987, p. 32) and that and#34;subjectivity is constructed by<br/>and in languageand#34; (Luke 26 Luke, 1995, p. 378), then their transformative<br/>projects are encoded so as to exclude any consideration of the nonhuman.<br/>Such assumptions effectively remove all subjects from nature. As Evernden<br/>(1992) puts it, and#34;if subjectivity, willing, valuation, and meaning are securely<br/>lodged in the domain of humanity, the possibility of encountering anything<br/>more than material objects in nature is niland#34; (p. 108).<br/>What is forgotten? What is erased when the real is equated with a<br/>proliferating culture of commodified signs (see Luke 26 Luke, 1995, on<br/>Baudrillard)? To begin, we forget that we humans are surrounded by an<br/>astonishing diversity of life forms. We no longer perceive or give expression to a world in which everything has intelligence, personality, and<br/>voice. Polyphonous echoes are reduced to homophony, a term Kane (1994)<br/>uses to denote and#34;the reduced sound of human language when it is used<br/>under the assumption that speech is something belonging only to human<br/>beingsand#34; (p. 192). We forget too what Abram (1996) describes as the gestural,<br/>somatic dimension of language, its sensory and physical resonance that we<br/>share with all expressive bodies (p. 80).</p><p>We don’t actually kill ourselves – but the thought experiment forces us to confront anthro<br/>Kochi and Ordan 8 (Queen’s University, Borderlands journal, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.borderlands.net.au/vol7no3_2008/kochiordan_argument.pdf)JFS  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.borderlands.net.au/vol7no3_2008/kochiordan_argument.pdf)JFS%27" tppabs="http://www.borderlands.net.au/vol7no3_2008/kochiordan_argument.pdf)JFS"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.borderlands.net.au/vol7no3_2008/kochiordan_argument.pdf)JFS</span></a></span><br/>From the outset it is important to make clear that the argument for the &nbsp;global <br/>AND<br/>human to the non-human have, &nbsp;so far, been unavailing.</p></div></div></td><td>9/18/13</td></tr><tr><td style="width:100%; word-break:break-all; word-break:break-word;"><div><p><input onclick="saveEntry(18)" src="../../xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" tppabs="http://opencaselist13.paperlessdebate.com/xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" style="float:right;" title="Save" type="image" value="Save"></input>

To understand why he did so, we have to begin a century earlier. In The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere Jürgen Habermas locates the beginning of what he calls the Public Sphere in the middle of the 18th century. He explains that at that time the Press and coffee houses</p><p>became the locus of a new form of political discussion.

Since the members of the Public being outside political power take no stand, the Public Sphere, though the Press, removes all seriousness from human action so that, at the limit, the Press becomes a voyeuristic form of irresponsible amusement that enjoys the undermining of "outstanding individuals".</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HVotenegativetointerruptthemechanismsofthe1ACtoconfrontthemwiththefalsityofanyfaithinthepublicsphere" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Vote negative to interrupt the mechanisms of the 1AC to confront them with the falsity of any faith in the public sphere</span></h4><p><strong>Perucci 9&nbsp;</strong>(Tony, ssistant Professor of Co mmunication Studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, "What the F uck is T hat?
