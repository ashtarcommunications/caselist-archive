"China accounted for 21 percent of Japan’s exports and imports in 2011," according to the Wall Street Journal, and the total value of annual trade between Japan and China was 24345 billion. By contrast, the estimated value of the annual production of the Chunxiao gas field, which is often cited as one of the reasons for the conflict, is a mere 241.1 billion (based on average 2011 wellhead prices). That is just under a third of one percent of annual trade between the two countries (see graph). &nbsp;Second, even if it did come to blows, there is no reason to believe that it would escalate to a full-scale war, much less a nuclear conflict. There have been lots of "conflicts" and "crises" over uninhabited islands, including the Perejil Island, Imia and Kardak, and the Picton, Lennox and Nueva islands, but none ever resulted in anything like a full-scale war. Even the Falklands war hardly resulted in disaster for the region. &nbsp;Third, not only does Japan still operate under a pacifist constitution, but China actually has a record of peacefully settling border disputes by agreeing to compromises. Even when border disputes precipitated a 32-day war with India in 1962 and a 28-day war with Vietnam in 1979, these have hardly led to regional instability or other serious consequences. &nbsp;Considering all this, why is the media full of bluster, vitriol and dire warnings? As I have pointed out before, all foreign correspondents in China are based in major cities and (generally through no fault of their own) have a difficult time reporting outside of them. Foreign reporters and their photographers were there to witness the anti-Japanese protests first hand and get lots of compelling pictures. On the other hand, they largely miss the tens of thousands of protests against land expropriation in China every year that a co-author and I examine in a forthcoming paper. By comparison, anti-Japanese protests are an easily handled blip and, at any rate, are partially stage-managed by the government. Indeed, the Shanghai police have successfully prevented significant damage of the Japanese consulate there, simply because they do not want to pick up the tab for repairs. For its part, the Japanese government bought the islands to prevent nationalists from "seizing control of the islands, a move which would be certain to further inflame nationalistic sentiment in China."

And this sense of unease about where we’re headed is hardly unfamiliar. Much like the emergence of drone technology, the rise of China and its reshaping of the geopolitical landscape has stirred up a sometimes understandable, sometimes irrational, fear of the unknown. It’s safe to say, then, that Chinese drones conjure up a particularly intense sense of alarm that the media has begun to embrace as a license to panic. China is indeed developing a range of unmanned aerial vehicles/systems (UAVs/UASs) at a time when relations with Japan are tense, and when those with the U.S. are delicate. But that hardly justifies claims that "drones have taken center stage in an escalating arms race between China and Japan," or that the "China drone threat highlights ~a~ new global arms race," as some observers would have it. This hyperbole was perhaps fed by a 2012 U.S. Department of Defense report which described China’s development of UAVs as "alarming." That’s quite unreasonable. All of the world’s advanced militaries are adopting drones, not just the PLA. That isn’t an arms race, or a reason to fear China, it’s just the direction in which defense technology is naturally progressing. Secondly, while China may be demonstrating impressive advances, Israel and the U.S. retain a substantial lead in the UAV field, with China—alongside Europe, India and Russia— still in the second tier. And thirdly, China is modernizing in all areas of military technology – unmanned systems being no exception.</p><h4 id="H1nr" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>1nr</span></h4><h4

Meanwhile, variables strewn across the path to an attack would increase the complexity of the effort, Mueller argued. &nbsp;Terrorists would have to bribe officials in a state nuclear program to acquire the material, while avoiding a sting by authorities or a scam by the sellers. The material itself could also turn out to be bad. &nbsp;"Once the purloined material is purloined, ~police are~ going to be chasing after you. They are also going to put on a high reward, extremely high reward, on getting the weapon back or getting the fissile material back," Mueller said during a panel discussion at a two-day Cato Institute conference on counterterrorism issues facing the incoming Obama administration. &nbsp;Smuggling the material out of a country would mean relying on criminals who "are very good at extortion" and might have to be killed to avoid a double-cross, Mueller said. The terrorists would then have to find scientists and engineers willing to give up their normal lives to manufacture a bomb, which would require an expensive and sophisticated machine shop. &nbsp;Finally, further technological expertise would be needed to sneak the weapon across national borders to its destination point and conduct a successful detonation, Mueller said. &nbsp;Every obstacle is "difficult but not impossible" to overcome, Mueller said, putting the chance of success at no less than one in three for each. The likelihood of successfully passing through each obstacle, in sequence, would be roughly one in 3 1/2 billion, he said, but for argument’s sake dropped it to 3 1/2 million. &nbsp;"It’s a total gamble. This is a very expensive and difficult thing to do," said Mueller, who addresses the issue at greater length in an upcoming book, Atomic Obsession. "So unlike buying a ticket to the lottery ... you’re basically putting everything, including your life, at stake for a gamble that’s maybe one in 3 1/2 million or 3 1/2 billion." &nbsp;Other scenarios are even less probable, Mueller said. &nbsp;A nuclear-armed state is "exceedingly unlikely" to hand a weapon to a terrorist group, he argued: "States just simply won’t give it to somebody they can’t control." &nbsp;Terrorists are also not likely to be able to steal a whole weapon, Mueller asserted, dismissing the idea of "loose nukes." Even Pakistan, which today is perhaps the nation of greatest concern regarding nuclear security, keeps its bombs in two segments that are stored at different locations, he said (see GSN, Jan. 12). &nbsp;Fear of an "extremely improbable event" such as nuclear terrorism produces support for a wide range of homeland security activities, Mueller said. He argued that there has been a major and costly overreaction to the terrorism threat — noting that the Sept. 11 attacks helped to precipitate the invasion of Iraq, which has led to far more deaths than the original event. &nbsp;Panel moderator Benjamin Friedman, a research fellow at the Cato Institute, said academic and governmental discussions of acts of nuclear or biological terrorism have tended to focus on "worst-case assumptions about terrorists’ ability to use these weapons to kill us." There is need for consideration for what is probable rather than simply what is possible, he said. &nbsp;Friedman took issue with the finding late last year of an experts’ report that an act of WMD terrorism would "more likely than not" occur in the next half decade unless the international community takes greater action. "I would say that the report, if you read it, actually offers no analysis to justify that claim, which seems to have been made to change policy by generating alarm in headlines." &nbsp;One panel speaker offered a partial rebuttal to Mueller’s presentation. Jim Walsh, principal research scientist for the Security Studies Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said he agreed that nations would almost certainly not give a nuclear weapon to a nonstate group, that most terrorist organizations have no interest in seeking out the bomb, and that it would be difficult to build a weapon or use one that has been stolen.&nbsp;</p><p>Al Qaeda isn’t key to terrorism<br/>Sageman, Foreign Policy Research Institute senior fellow, 2009<br/>(Marc, "Confronting al-Qaeda: Understanding the Threat in Afghanistan", <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.terrorismanalysts.com/pt/index.php?option=com_rokzine26view=article26id=9226Itemid=54-http://www.terrorismanalysts.com/pt/index.php?option=com_rokzine26view=article26id=9226Itemid=54  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path excluded from retrieval by the project\%27s Exclusions properties.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.terrorismanalysts.com/pt/index.php?option=com_rokzine26view=article26id=9226Itemid=54-http://www.terrorismanalysts.com/pt/index.php?option=com_rokzine26view=article26id=9226Itemid=54%27" tppabs="http://www.terrorismanalysts.com/pt/index.php?option=com_rokzine26view=article26id=9226Itemid=54-http://www.terrorismanalysts.com/pt/index.php?option=com_rokzine26view=article26id=9226Itemid=54"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.terrorismanalysts.com/pt/index.php?option=com_rokzine26view=article26id=9226Itemid=54-http://www.terrorismanalysts.com/pt/index.php?option=com_rokzine26view=article26id=9226Itemid=54</span></a></span>, ldg)</p><p>The above statistics are crystal clear: 78 of all global neo-jihadi terrorist plots in the West in the past five years came from autonomous homegrown groups without any connection, direction or control from al-Qaeda Core or its allies.

They now have only about 20 percent of the peak number of around 70,000 in 1986, when the Soviet Union had about 45,000 and the United States about 24,000 (down from a peak of 32,500 in 1967), of which 33,800 and 10,550 respectively were classed as tactical or ’theatre’ weapons and 11,200 and 13,450 as strategic. Most of the tactical and theatre weapons have been dismantled and the numbers of strategic weapons halved. The United States and Russia still possess a total of about 15,300 nuclear weapons, or about 7,200 and 8,130 respectively. As of April 2005, they had 10,700 operational strategic nuclear weapons: the United States with 5,996 and Russia with 4,732.8 The United States has 1,200 non-strategic weapons (800 B-61 gravity bombs and 320 nuclear-armed Tomahawk land-attack cruise missiles) and Russia about 3,400. The prospects of a nuclear war between the United States and Russia must now be deemed fairly remote. There are now no geostrategic issues that warrant nuclear competition and no inclination in either Washington or Moscow to provoke such issues. US and Russian strategic forces have been taken off day-to-day alert and their ICBMs ’de-targeted’, greatly reducing the possibilities of war by accident, inadvertence or miscalculation. On the other hand, while the US-Russia strategic competition is in abeyance, there are several aspects of current US nuclear weapons policy which are profoundly disturbing. In December 2001 President George W. Bush officially announced that the United States was withdrawing from the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty of 1972, one of the mainstays of strategic nuclear arms control during the Cold War, with effect from June 2002, and was proceeding to develop and deploy an extensive range of both theatre missile defence and national missile defence (NMD) systems. The first anti-missile missile in the NMD system, designed initially to defend against limited missile attacks from China and North Korea, was installed at Fort Greely in Alaska in July 2004. The initial system, consisting of sixteen interceptor missiles at Fort Greely and four at Vandenberg Air Force in California, is expected to be operational by the end of 2005. The Bush Administration is also considering withdrawal from the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and resuming nuclear testing. (The last US nuclear test was on 23 September 1992). In particular, some key Administration officials believe that testing is necessary to develop a ’new generation’ of nuclear weapons, including low-yield, ’bunker-busting’, earth-penetrating weapons specifically designed to destroy very hard and deeply buried targets (such as underground command and control centres and leadership bunkers).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Heg doesn’t solve war or conflict- empirically proven<br/>Mearsheimer, University of Chicago political science professor, 2011 <br/>~John, R. Wendell Harrison Distinguished Service Professor of Political Science at the University of Chicago, and member of the Advisory Council of The National Interest, The National Interest, "Imperial by Design," Jan/Feb, l/n, accessed 3-9-11, mss~</p><p>One year later, Charles Krauthammer emphasized in "The Unipolar Moment" that the United States had emerged from the Cold War as by far the most powerful country on the planet.2 He urged American leaders not to be reticent about using that power "to lead a unipolar world, unashamedly laying down the rules of world order and being prepared to enforce them." Krauthammer’s advice fit neatly with Fukuyama’s vision of the future: the United States should take the lead in bringing democracy to less developed countries the world over. After all, that shouldn’t be an especially difficult task given that America had awesome power and the cunning of history on its side. U.S. grand strategy has followed this basic prescription for the past twenty years, mainly because most policy makers inside the Beltway have agreed with the thrust of Fukuyama’s and Krauthammer’s early analyses. The results, however, have been disastrous. The United States has been at war for a startling two out of every three years since 1989, and there is no end in sight. As anyone with a rudimentary knowledge of world events knows, countries that continuously fight wars invariably build powerful national-security bureaucracies that undermine civil liberties and make it difficult to hold leaders accountable for their behavior; and they invariably end up adopting ruthless policies normally associated with brutal dictators. The Founding Fathers understood this problem, as is clear from James Madison’s observation that "no nation can preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare." Washington’s pursuit of policies like assassination, rendition and torture over the past decade, not to mention the weakening of the rule of law at home, shows that their fears were justified. To make matters worse, the United States is now engaged in protracted wars in Afghanistan and Iraq that have so far cost well over a trillion dollars and resulted in around forty-seven thousand American casualties. The pain and suffering inflicted on Iraq has been enormous. Since the war began in March 2003, more than one hundred thousand Iraqi civilians have been killed, roughly 2 million Iraqis have left the country and 1.7 million more have been internally displaced. Moreover, the American military is not going to win either one of these conflicts, despite all the phony talk about how the "surge" has worked in Iraq and how a similar strategy can produce another miracle in Afghanistan. We may well be stuck in both quagmires for years to come, in fruitless pursuit of victory. The United States has also been unable to solve three other major foreign-policy problems. Washington has worked overtime-with no success-to shut down Iran’s uranium-enrichment capability for fear that it might lead to Tehran acquiring nuclear weapons. And the United States, unable to prevent North Korea from acquiring nuclear weapons in the first place, now seems incapable of compelling Pyongyang to give them up. Finally, every post-Cold War administration has tried and failed to settle the Israeli-Palestinian conflict; all indicators are that this problem will deteriorate further as the West Bank and Gaza are incorporated into a Greater Israel. The unpleasant truth is that the United States is in a world of trouble today on the foreign-policy front, and this state of affairs is only likely to get worse in the next few years, as Afghanistan and Iraq unravel and the blame game escalates to poisonous levels. Thus, it is hardly surprising that a recent Chicago Council on Global Affairs survey found that "looking forward 50 years, only 33 percent of Americans think the United States will continue to be the world’s leading power." Clearly, the heady days of the early 1990s have given way to a pronounced pessimism.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h2 id="HU.S.can2019tdeployhegtosolveconflicts2013publicrestraint2Cinternationalrelations2Canddeploymentcapabilities" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>U.S. can’t deploy heg to solve conflicts – public restraint, international relations, and deployment capabilities</span></h2><p>Talmadge, Staff Writer for the Harvard International Review, 2006<br/>(Caitlin, Ph.D. candidate in political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, "The Restrained Hegemon," 5-6-06, Harvard International Review, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:http://hir.harvard.edu/intelligence/the-restrained-hegemon  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:http://hir.harvard.edu/intelligence/the-restrained-hegemon%27" tppabs="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:http://hir.harvard.edu/intelligence/the-restrained-hegemon"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:http://hir.harvard.edu/intelligence/the-restrained-hegemon</span></a></span>, accessed 3-17-11, mtf)</p><p>First, the domestic politics of the United States limit its international freedom of action. Although the president may have the world’s finest military at his command, he often lacks the combination of public and congressional support he needs to maximize its advantages. Foreign policy surveys show that US citizens remain casualty-averse unless vital US interests such as preventing terrorism seem to be at stake. And except for a brief period of bipartisanship after September 11, the notion of politics stopping at the water’s edge now seems as quaint and obsolete as Cold War air raid drills. Internal divisions frequently prevent the United States from acting as quickly, decisively, or forcefully as its material resources would allow. This reality does not go unnoticed by other nations: what seems like democratic debate to US citizens may appear to others as a lack of resolve or an opportunity for political manipulation, further complicating the execution of US foreign policy. Second, the complexity of international politics poses a serious challenge to the exercise of US power. Despite its military prowess, the United States remains fundamentally dependent on support from local allies when it operates abroad. The geographic position of a weak state may endow it with a powerful bargaining chip when the United States needs basing rights or access to airspace. This leverage requires diplomatic finesse and sensitivity to those foreign leaders’ own domestic constraints. Political skill turns out to be just as important as military strength—and, unfortunately for the United States, much more evenly distributed. Even relatively weak states can often exploit political cracks in the United States’ relationships with its allies, providing third parties with leverage over the United States despite their material inferiority. Third, even when the United States is capable of capturing an advantage by acting unilaterally, it often finds itself trapped in what Bruce Conin has called the "paradox of hegemony." The United States certainly has the ability to act as a great power and pursue its short-term interest in a particular case: for example, by intervening in a foreign country to secure oil. Actually doing so, however, would undermine its role as a hegemon trying to lead the international system according to a set of rules (in this case, the UN Charter) which benefit its long-term interests and help legitimize its power. Moreover, in pursuing its short-term interest of securing oil, the hegemon would undermine its provision of the public good of law and order that helps other states tolerate the hegemon’s power. Other states might then begin to balance more actively against the hegemon, hastening its decline. To stave off this type of backlash, which would damage broader US interests, the United States often imposes limits upon its own actions or gives in to the demands of weaker states. In order to remain the sole superpower, the United States avoids acting like one.\</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h2 id="HUScan2019tprojectpowernow" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>US can’t project power now</span></h2><p>Parent et al., Miamia political science professor, 2011<br/>(Joseph, "The Wisdom of Retrenchment", Foreign Affairs, Nov/Dec, ebsco, ldg)</p><p>The trend of the last decade is disturbing: as military spending soared, U.S. success abroad sagged. To be clear, the United States continues to field the best-armed, most skilled military in the world. The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have bent, but not broken, the all-volunteer force, and the burden of maintaining this formidable force is not unacceptably onerous. The proposed 24553 billion base-line defense budget for 2012 represents just 15 percent of the federal budget and less than five percent of GDP. (TO put that figure in perspective, consider that the proposed 2012 budget for Social Security spending tops 24760 billion.) Yet current trends will make it harder for the United States to continue to purchase hegemony as easily as it has in the past. Changes in military tactics and technology are eroding the United States’ advantages. The proliferation of antiship cruise missiles makes it harder for the U.S. Navy to operate near adversaries’ shores. Advanced surface-to-air missiles likewise raise the cost of maintaining U.S. air superiority in hostile theaters. Nationalist and tribal insurgencies, fueled by a brisk small-arms trade, have proved difficult to combat with conventional ground forces. U.S. defense dominance is getting more expensive at a moment when it is becoming less expensive for other states and actors to challenge the sole superpower. Beyond these challenges to the country’s military dominance, a weakened economic condition is contributing to the decline of U.S. power. The U.S. economy remains the largest in the world, yet its position is in jeopardy. Between 1999 and 2009, the U.S. share of global GDP (measured in terms of purchasing power parity) fell from 23 percent to 20 percent, whereas China’s share of global GDP jumped from seven percent to 13 percent. Should this trend continue, China’s economic output will surpass the United States’ by 2016. China already consumes more energy than the United States, and calls are growing louder to replace the dollar as the international reserve currency with a basket of currencies that would include the euro and the yuan. The fiscal position of the United States is alarming, whether or not one believes that Standard 26 Poor’s was justified in downgrading U.S. Treasury bonds. Between 2001 and 2009, U.S. federal debt as a percentage of GDP more than doubled, from 32 percent to 67 percent, and state and local governments have significant debts, too. The United States’ reliance on imports, combined with high rates of borrowing, has led to a considerable current account deficit: more than six percent of GDP in 2006. Power follows money, and the United States is leaking cash.</p><h4 id="H1nr-1" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>1nr</span></h4><h4 id="HDoesn2019tsolveterrorism" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Doesn’t solve terrorism</span></h4><p>Zakaria, Board of Directors for Amnesty International, 13<br/>(Rafia, 4-26, "President Obama: The Drones Don’t Work, They Just Make It Worse", date accessed: 9-15-13, LMM)<br/> <br/>Moving the drone program from the CIA to the Department of Defense is thus being <br/>AND<br/>the world, wherever a possible or even supposed threat can be identified.&nbsp;</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HNoevastowhatligitaioniscomingwheretheyhappen2Cwhenithappens.Zeroevtheplansolvespublicbacklash." class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>No ev as to what ligitaion is coming where they happen, when it happens. &nbsp;Zero ev the plan solves public backlash.</span></h4><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HNoImpact2013AlQaeda2019sdecimated" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>No Impact – Al Qaeda’s decimated</span></h4><p>Zenko and Cohen, CFR Fellow and The New School International Affairs Director, ’12<br/>(Micah and Michael "Clear and Present Safety" Foreign Affairs 14 March 2012 <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/clear-and-present-safety-http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/clear-and-present-safety  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path excluded from retrieval by the project\%27s Exclusions properties.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/clear-and-present-safety-http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/clear-and-present-safety%27" tppabs="http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/clear-and-present-safety-http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/clear-and-present-safety"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/clear-and-present-safety-http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/clear-and-present-safety</span></a></span> accessed: 9-15-13 mlb)</p><p>&nbsp;Take terrorism.

As a preliminary matter, there is not much causal evidence that supports the institutional constraints logic. As various commentators have noted, Congress’s bark with respect to war powers is often much greater than its bite. Significantly, skeptics like Barbara Hinckley suggest that any notion of an activist Congress in war powers is a myth and members of Congress will often use the smokescreen of "symbolic resolutions, increase in roll calls and lengthy hearings, ~and~ addition of reporting requirements" to create the illusion of congressional participation in foreign policy.10 Indeed, even those commentators who support a more aggressive role for Congress in initiating conflicts acknowledge this problem,11 but suggest conflict objectives and implement new tools for monitoring executive behavior during wartime.12 Yet, even if Congress were equipped with better institutional tools to constrain and monitor the President’s military initiatives, it is not clear that it would significantly alter the current war powers landscape. As Horn and Shepsle have argued elsewhere: "~N~either specificity in enabling legislation ... nor participation by interested parties is necessarily optimal or self- fulfilling; therefore, they do not ensure agent compliance. Ultimately, there must be some enforcement feature - a credible commitment to punish . . . ,"13 Thus, no matter how much well-intentioned and specific legislation Congress passes to increase congressional oversight of the President’s military initiatives, it will come to naught if members of Congress lack institutional incentives to monitor and constrain the President’s behavior in an international crisis. Various congressional observers have highlighted electoral disincentives that members of Congress might face in constraining the President’s military initiatives.14 Others have pointed to more institutional obstacles to congressional assertiveness in foreign relations, such as collective action problems.15 Generally, lawmaking is a demanding and grueling exercise. If one assumes that members of Congress are often obsessed with the prospect of reelection,16 then such members will tend to focus their scarce resources on district-level concerns and hesitate to second-guess the President’s response in an international crisis.17 Even if members of Congress could marshal the resources to challenge the President’s agenda on national issues, the payoff in electoral terms might be trivial or non-existent. Indeed, in the case of the President’s military initiatives where the median voter is likely to defer to the executive branch’s judgment, the electoral payoff for members of Congress of constraining such initiatives might actually be negative. In other words, regardless of how explicit the grant of a constitutional role to Congress in foreign affairs might be, few members of Congress are willing to make the personal sacrifice for the greater institutional goal. Thus, unless a grand reformer is able to tweak the system and make congressional assertiveness an electorally palatable option in war powers, calls for greater congressional participation in war powers are likely to fall on deaf ears ~be ignored~</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>Can’t solve <br/>Kuyers, Professor of Law at American University Washington College of Law, 13<br/>(Josh, 4-4, "CIA or DoD: Clarifying the Legal Framework Applicable to the Drone Authority Debate", date accessed: 9-16-13, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://nationalsecuritylawbrief.com/2013/04/04/cia-or-dod-clarifying-the-legal-framework-applicable-to-the-drone-authority-debate/-http://nationalsecuritylawbrief.com/2013/04/04/cia-or-dod-clarifying-the-legal-framework-applicable-to-the-drone-authority-debate/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path excluded from retrieval by the project\%27s Exclusions properties.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://nationalsecuritylawbrief.com/2013/04/04/cia-or-dod-clarifying-the-legal-framework-applicable-to-the-drone-authority-debate/-http://nationalsecuritylawbrief.com/2013/04/04/cia-or-dod-clarifying-the-legal-framework-applicable-to-the-drone-authority-debate/%27" tppabs="http://nationalsecuritylawbrief.com/2013/04/04/cia-or-dod-clarifying-the-legal-framework-applicable-to-the-drone-authority-debate/-http://nationalsecuritylawbrief.com/2013/04/04/cia-or-dod-clarifying-the-legal-framework-applicable-to-the-drone-authority-debate/"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://nationalsecuritylawbrief.com/2013/04/04/cia-or-dod-clarifying-the-legal-framework-applicable-to-the-drone-authority-debate/-http://nationalsecuritylawbrief.com/2013/04/04/cia-or-dod-clarifying-the-legal-framework-applicable-to-the-drone-authority-debate/</span></a></span>, LMM)</p><p>Scholars and practitioners use the term "Title 10 authority" as a catchall phrase to describe the legal authority for military operations. Unfortunately, the use of the term in this way is misleading because "Title 10 – Armed Forces" does not contain actual operational authorities; it merely describes the organizational structure of the Department of Defense.

Like the term "Title 10 authority," Title 50 authority is a misnomer. Title 50 is often referred to as the CIA’s authority to conduct its intelligence operations and covert actions –like drone strikes. Yet Title 50 of the United States Code is actually titled "War and National Defense." Thus, it contains much more than just CIA authority. Military personnel can also act under Title 50 authority – a fact often overlooked in news articles and editorials. In fact, the DoD undertakes the majority of intelligence activities under Title 50 authorities. Like moving drone operations from the CIA to the DoD, the Title 10-Title 50 debate is really about oversight and accountability, particularly congressional oversight. Title 10 oversight lies with the House and Senate Armed Services Committees and the Executive Branch. In terms of operational oversight, it primarily consists of oversight over "traditional military activities." Traditional military activities are undertaken: 1) By military personnel; 2) Under the direction and control of a United States military commander; and 3) related to ongoing hostilities where the fact of the U.S. role in the overall operation is apparent or to be acknowledged publicly. With regard to drone operations, the keys aspects of this definition include who is undertaking the strikes and under what command structure; the strikes’ relationship to "ongoing hostilities;" and the level of secrecy involved. Current DoD drone operations in Afghanistan, for instance, would clearly fall under congressional oversight of traditional military operations. It is also clear that any CIA drone strikes would not fall under Title 10 oversight. However, there are multiple scenarios in which DoD drone operations would not fall under Title 10 oversight. Given the conjunctive, three-part test defining a traditional military activity, drone operations 1) outside the context of ongoing hostilities, 2) under CIA command and control, or 3) not acknowledged publicly, would not be considered traditional military activities, regardless of whether military personnel piloted the drone and pulled the trigger. Therefore, the Obama Administrations’ impending decision to move drone operations from the CIA to the DoD may have several loopholes. Indeed, these operations would likely be considered "covert actions" and held accountable to Title 50 oversight and accountability. A covert action is "an activity or activities of the United States Government to influence political, economic, or military conditions abroad, where it is intended that the role of the United States Government will not be apparent or acknowledged publicly." Overall, Title 50 oversight may actually be more stringent, though less transparent, than Title 10 oversight. Drone operations classified as covert actions –whether undertaken by the CIA or the DoD- are subject to both a presidential finding and congressional notification requirement. Section 413(b) of Title 50 of the U.S. Code requires the President to keep the congressional intelligence committees "fully and currently informed" of all ongoing covert actions. It also requires the President to report his presidential finding to the intelligence committees "as soon as possible after such approval and before the initiation of the covert action." However, in "extraordinary circumstances affecting vital interests of the United States," this prior notification requirement can be limited to the so-called "Gang of Eight." Although in these extreme cases the prior notification requirement is limited, it is important to note that, at least under the statutory authority, the President simply cannot refuse to notify Congress. Ultimately, as many of the recent editorials note, any shift in the operational authority over drone strikes from the CIA to the DoD may have little practical effect. This posting explains that the intended increase in accountability and transparency may actually be prevented by the Title 10-Title 50 legal framework meant to provide congressional oversight over drone operations. This is because Congress’ Title 50 oversight functions are meant to provide limited, yet timely information for those operations that, if made public, would prove damaging to U.S. national security or foreign relations. In contrast, Congress’ Title 10 oversight is less stringent because did not envision the military engaging in ongoing hostilities against a global terrorist threat. Given the legal framework governing operational oversight, the Obama Administration might consider providing more transparency and accountability through regularly scheduled, voluntary briefings rather than shifting operational command and control.&nbsp;</p><p>Aff inevitable <br/>Goldsmith ’13<br/>(Jack "No More Drones for CIA" 3-20-13 <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.lawfareblog.com/2013/03/no-more-drones-for-cia/-http://www.lawfareblog.com/2013/03/no-more-drones-for-cia/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path excluded from retrieval by the project\%27s Exclusions properties.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.lawfareblog.com/2013/03/no-more-drones-for-cia/-http://www.lawfareblog.com/2013/03/no-more-drones-for-cia/%27" tppabs="http://www.lawfareblog.com/2013/03/no-more-drones-for-cia/-http://www.lawfareblog.com/2013/03/no-more-drones-for-cia/"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.lawfareblog.com/2013/03/no-more-drones-for-cia/-http://www.lawfareblog.com/2013/03/no-more-drones-for-cia/</span></a></span> accessed: 11-2-13 mlb)</p><p>&nbsp;That is the title of Dan Klaidman’s important story: &nbsp;Three senior U.S. officials tell The Daily Beast that the White House is poised to sign off on a plan to shift the CIA’s lethal targeting program to the Defense Department. . . .The proposed plan would unify the command and control structure of targeted killings, and create a uniform set of rules and procedures.

As noted above, we lack good data on the field’s practical relevance, and the difficulties establishing appropriate measures are all too apparent in the fraught attempts by several governments to quantify the impact of the humanities and social sciences more generally. Beyond this, though, we lack any credible evidence that any fluctuations in the field’s relevance are due to more or less high theory. We hear that policymakers complain of not being able to understand or apply much that appears in our leading journals, but it is unclear why we should be any more concerned about this than physicists or economists, who take theory, even high theory, to be the bedrock of advancement in knowledge. Moreover, there is now a wealth of research, inside and outside IR, that shows that policy communities are not open epistemic or cognitive realms, simply awaiting well-communicated, non-jargonistic knowledge – they are bureaucracies, deeply susceptible to groupthink, that filter information through their own intersubjective frames. 10 Beyond this, however, there are good reasons to believe that precisely the reverse of the theory versus relevance thesis might be true; that theoretical inquiry may be a necessary prerequisite for the generation of practically relevant knowledge. I will focus here on the value of metatheory, as this attracts most contemporary criticism and would appear the most difficult of theoretical forms to defend. Metatheories take other theories as their subject. Indeed, their precepts establish the conditions of possibility for second-order theories. In general, metatheories divide into three broad categories: epistemology, ontology and meta-ethics. The first concerns the nature, validity and acquisition of knowledge; the second, the nature of being (what can be said to exist, how things might be categorised and how they stand in relation to one another); and the third, the nature of right and wrong, what constitutes moral argument, and how moral arguments might be sustained. Second-order theories are constructed within, and on the basis of, assumptions formulated at the metatheoretical level. Epistemological assumptions about what constitutes legitimate knowledge and how it is legitimately acquired delimit the questions we ask and the kinds of information we can enlist in answering them. 11 Can social scientists ask normative questions? Is literature a valid source of social-scientific knowledge? Ontological assumptions about the nature and distinctiveness of the social universe affect not only what we ’see’ but also how we order what we see; how we relate the material to the ideational, agents to structures, interests to beliefs, and so on. If we assume, for example, that individuals are rational actors, engaged in the efficient pursuit of primarily material interests, then phenomena such as faith-motivated politics will remain at the far periphery of our vision. 12 Lastly, meta-ethical assumptions about the nature of the good, and about what constitutes a valid moral argument, frame how we reason about concrete ethical problems. Both deontology and consequentialism are meta-ethical positions, operationalised, for example, in the differing arguments of Charles Beitz and Peter Singer on global distributive justice. 13 Most scholars would acknowledge the background, structuring role that metatheory plays, but argue that we can take our metatheoretical assumptions off the shelf, get on with the serious business of research and leave explicit metatheoretical reflection and debate to the philosophers. If practical relevance is one of our concerns, however, there are several reasons why this is misguided. Firstly, whether IR is practically relevant depends, in large measure, on the kinds of questions that animate our research. I am not referring here to the commonly held notion that we should be addressing questions that practitioners want answered. Indeed, our work will at times be most relevant when we pursue questions that policymakers and others would prefer left buried. My point is a different one, which I return to in greater detail below. It is sufficient to note here that being practically relevant involves asking questions of practice; not just retrospective questions about past practices – their nature, sources and consequences – but prospective questions about what human agents should do. As I have argued elsewhere, being practically relevant means asking questions of how we, ourselves, or some other actors (states, policymakers, citizens, NGOs, IOs, etc.) should act. 14 Yet our ability, nay willingness, to ask such questions is determined by the metatheoretical assumptions that structure our research and arguments. This is partly an issue of ontology – what we see affects how we understand the conditions of action, rendering some practices possible or impossible, mandatory or beyond the pale. If, for example, we think that political change is driven by material forces, then we are unlikely to see communicative practices of argument and persuasion as potentially successful sources of change. More than this, though, it is also an issue of epistemology. If we assume that the proper domain of IR as a social science is the acquisition of empirically verifiable knowledge, then we will struggle to comprehend, let alone answer, normative questions of how we should act. We will either reduce ’ought’ questions to ’is’ questions, or place them off the agenda altogether. 15 Our metatheoretical assumptions thus determine the macro-orientation of IR towards questions of practice, directly affecting the field’s practical relevance. Secondly, metatheoretical revolutions license new second-order theoretical and analytical possibilities while foreclosing others, directly affecting those forms of scholarship widely considered most practically relevant. The rise of analytical eclecticism illustrates this. As noted above, Katzenstein and Sil’s call for a pragmatic approach to the study of world politics, one that addresses real-world problematics by combining insights from diverse research traditions, resonates with the mood of much of the field, especially within the American mainstream. Epistemological and ontological debates are widely considered irresolvable dead ends, grand theorising is unfashionable, and gladiatorial contests between rival paradigms appear, increasingly, as unimaginative rituals. Boredom and fatigue are partly responsible for this new mood, but something deeper is at work. Twenty-five years ago, Sil and Katzenstein’s call would have fallen on deaf ears; the neo-neo debate that preoccupied the American mainstream occurred within a metatheoretical consensus, one that combined a neo-positivist epistemology with a rationalist ontology. This singular metatheoretical framework defined the rules of the game; analytical eclecticism was unimaginable. The Third Debate of the 1980s and early 1990s destabilised all of this; not because American IR scholars converted in their droves to critical theory or poststructuralism (far from it), but because metatheoretical absolutism became less and less tenable. The anti-foundationalist critique of the idea that there is any single measure of truth did not produce a wave of relativism, but it did generate a widespread sense that battles on the terrain of epistemology were unwinnable. Similarly, the Third Debate emphasis on identity politics and cultural particularity, which later found expression in constructivism, did not vanquish rationalism. It did, however, establish a more pluralistic, if nevertheless heated, debate about ontology, a terrain on which many scholars felt more comfortable than that of epistemology. One can plausibly argue, therefore, that the metatheoretical struggles of the Third Debate created a space for – even made possible – the rise of analytical eclecticism and its aversion to metatheoretical absolutes, a principal benefit of which is said to be greater practical relevance. Lastly, most of us would agree that for our research to be practically relevant, it has to be good – it has to be the product of sound inquiry, and our conclusions have to be plausible. The pluralists among us would also agree that different research questions require different methods of inquiry and strategies of argument. Yet across this diversity there are several practices widely recognised as essential to good research. Among these are clarity of purpose, logical coherence, engagement with alternative arguments and the provision of good reasons (empirical evidence, corroborating arguments textual interpretations, etc.). Less often noted, however, is the importance of metatheoretical reflexivity. If our epistemological assumptions affect the questions we ask, then being conscious of these assumptions is necessary to ensure that we are not fencing off questions of importance, and that if we are, we can justify our choices. Likewise, if our ontological assumptions affect how we see the social universe, determining what is in or outside our field of vision, then reflecting on these assumptions can prevent us being blind to things that matter. A similar argument applies to our meta-ethical assumptions. Indeed, if deontology and consequentialism are both meta-ethical positions, as I suggested earlier, then reflecting on our choice of one or other position is part and parcel of weighing rival ethical arguments (on issues as diverse as global poverty and human rights). Finally, our epistemological, ontological and meta-ethical assumptions are not metatheoretical silos; assumptions we make in one have a tendency to shape those we make in another. The oft-heard refrain that ’if we can’t measure it, it doesn’t matter’ is an unfortunate example of epistemology supervening on ontology, something that metatheoretical reflexivity can help guard against. In sum, like clarity, coherence, consideration of alternative arguments and the provision of good reasons, metatheoretical reflexivity is part of keeping us honest, making it practically relevant despite its abstraction.&nbsp;</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HNonsensibleknowledgefirst2013learningcomesindependentof2019teaching2019" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Nonsensible knowledge first – learning comes independent of ’teaching’</span></h4><p>Halberstam, USC American Studies, Ethnicity Studies, and Comparative Literature Professor, ’11<br/>(Judith, Phd University of Minnesota, "The Queer Art of Failure" 2011 ebook. &nbsp;Accessed 12-20-13 mlb)</p><p>&nbsp;Second, Privilege the naïve or nonsensical (stupidity). Here we might argue for the nonsensible or nonconceptual over sense- making structures that are often embedded in a common notion of ethics. The naïve or the ignorant may in fact lead to a different set of knowledge practices. It certainly requires what some have called oppositional pedagogies. In pursuit of such pedagogies we must realize that, as Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick once said, ignorance is "as potent and multiple a thing as knowledge" and that learning often takes place completely independently of teaching (1991: 4). In fact, to speak personally for a moment, I am not sure that I myself am teachable21 As someone who never aced an exam, who has tried and tried without much success to become fluent in another language, and who can read a book without retaining much at all, I realize that I can &nbsp;learn only what I can teach myself, and that much of what I was taught in school left very little impression upon me at all. The question of unteachability arises as a political problem, indeed a national problem, in the extraordinary French documentary about a year in the life of a high school in the suburbs of Paris, The Class (Entre Les Murs, 2008, directed by Laurent Cantet). In the film a white schoolteacher, François Bégaudeau (who wrote the memoir upon which the film is based), tries to reach out to his disinterested and profoundly alienated, mostly African, Asian, and Arab immigrant students. The cultural and racial and class differences between the teacher and his students make effective communication difficult, and his cultural references (The Diary of Ann Frank, Molière, French grammar) leave the students cold, while theirs (soccer, Islam, hip- hop) induce only pained responses from their otherwise personable teacher. The film, like a Frederick Wiseman documentary, tries to just let the action unfold without any voice- of- God narration, so we see close up the rage and frustrations of teacher and students alike. At the end of the film an extraordinary moment occurs. Bégaudeau asks the students to think about what they have learned and write down one thing to take away from the class, one concept, text, or idea that might have made a difference. The class disperses, and one girl shuffles up to the front. The teacher looks at her expectantly and draws out her comment. "I didn’t learn anything," she tells him without malice or anger, "nothing. . . . I can’t think of anything I learned." The moment is a defeat for the teacher and a disappointment for the viewer, who wants to believe in a narrative of educational uplift, but it is a triumph for alternative pedagogies because it reminds us that learning is a two- way street and you cannot teach without a dialogic relation to the learner.&nbsp;</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HFrameworkreifiescolonialrelation2013wedon2019tneedtobe2019taught2019" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Framework reifies colonial relation – we don’t need to be ’taught’</span></h4><p>Halberstam, USC American Studies, Ethnicity Studies, and Comparative Literature Professor, ’11<br/>(Judith, Phd University of Minnesota, "The Queer Art of Failure" 2011 ebook. &nbsp;Accessed 12-20-13 mlb)</p><p>&nbsp;The Ignorant Schoolmaster advocates in an antidisciplinary way for emancipatory forms of knowledge that do not depend upon an overtrained pied piper leading obedient children out of the darkness and into the light. Jacotot summarizes his pedagogy thus: "I must teach you that I have nothing to teach you" (15). In this way he allows others to teach themselves and to learn without learning and internalizing a system of superior and inferior knowledges, superior and inferior intelligences. Like Paulo Freire’s Pedagogy of the Oppressed, which argues against a "banking" system of teaching and for a dialogic mode of learning that enacts a practice of freedom, Jacotot and then Ranciére see education and social transformation as mutually dependent. When we are taught that we cannot know things unless we are taught by great minds, we submit to a whole suite of unfree practices that take on the form of a colonial relation (Freire 2000). There are several responses possible to colonial knowledge formations: a violent response, on the order of Frantz Fanon’s claim that violent impositions of colonial rule must be met with violent resistance; a homeopathic response, within which the knower learns the dominant system better than its advocates and undermines it from within; or a negative response, in which the subject refuses the knowledge offered and refuses to be a knowing subject in the form mandated by Enlightenment philosophies of self and other. This book is in sympathy with the violent and negative forms of anticolonial knowing and builds on Moten’s &nbsp;and Harney’s opposition to the university as a site of incarcerated knowledge.&nbsp;</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HCurrentpoliciesperpetuatetherhetoricofcrisisandsecurity2Candthelinearscenariopredictionsofthesecurityparadigmareflawed.Thisleadstobureaucraticcompartmentalizationandfaultypolicy-analysis.Theimpactissystematicotherizationandmilitarizedresponsesthatculminateinwar." class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Current policies perpetuate the rhetoric of crisis and security, and the linear scenario predictions of the security paradigm are flawed.

While the structure of global economic activity is driving the unsustainable depletion of hydrocarbon and other natural resources, this is simultaneously escalating greenhouse gas emissions resulting in global warming. Both global warming and energy shocks are impacting detrimentally on global industrial food production, as well as on global financial and economic instability. Conventional policy responses toward the intensification of these crises have been decidedly inadequate because scholars and practitioners largely view them as separate processes. Yet increasing evidence shows they are deeply interwoven manifestations of a global political economy that has breached the limits of the wider environmental and natural resource systems in which it is embedded. In this context, orthodox IR’s flawed diagnoses of global crises lead inexorably to their ’securitisation’, reifying the militarisation of policy responses, and naturalising the proliferation of violent conflicts. Global ecological, energy and economic crises are thus directly linked to the ’Otherisation’ of social groups and problematisation of strategic regions considered pivotal for the global political economy. Yet this relationship between global crises and conflict is not necessary or essential, but a function of a wider epistemological failure to holistically interrogate their structural and systemic causes. In 2009, the UK government’s chief scientific adviser Sir John Beddington warned that without mitigating and preventive action ’drivers’ of global crisis like demographic expansion, environmental degradation and energy depletion could lead to a ’perfect storm’ of simultaneous food, water and energy crises by around 2030.1 Yet, for the most part, conventional policy responses from national governments and international institutions have been decidedly inadequate. Part of the problem is the way in which these crises are conceptualised in relation to security. Traditional disciplinary divisions in the social and natural sciences, compounded by bureaucratic compartmentalisation in policy-planning and decision-making, has meant these crises are frequently approached as largely separate processes with their own internal dynamics. While it is increasingly acknowledged that cross-disciplinary approaches are necessary, these have largely failed to recognise just how inherently interconnected these crises are. As Brauch points out, ’most studies in the environmental security debate since 1990 have ignored or failed to integrate the contributions of the global environmental change community in the natural sciences. To a large extent the latter has also failed to integrate the results of this debate.*" Underlying this problem is the lack of a holistic systems approach to thinking about not only global crises, but their causal origins in the social, political, economic, ideological and value structures of the contemporary international system. Indeed, it is often assumed that these contemporary structures are largely what need to be ’secured* and protected from the dangerous impacts of global crises, rather than transformed precisely to ameliorate these crises in the first place. Consequently, policy-makers frequently overlook existing systemic and structural obstacles to the implementation of desired reforms. In a modest effort to contribute to the lacuna identified by Brauch, this paper begins with an empiric ally-oriented, interdisciplinary exploration of the best available data on four major global crises — climate change, energy depletion, food scarcity and global financial instability — illustrating the systemic interconnections between different crises, and revealing that their causal origins are not accidental but inherent to the structural failings and vulnerabilities of existing global political, economic and cultural institutions. This empirical evaluation leads to a critical appraisal of orthodox realist and liberal approaches to global crises in international theory and policy. This critique argues principally that orthodox IR reifies a highly fragmented, de-historicised ontology of the international system which underlies a reductionist, technocratic and compartmentalised conceptual and methodological approach to global crises. Consequently, rather than global crises being understood causally and holistically in the systemic context of the structure of the international system, they are ’securitised* as amplifiers of traditional security threats requiring counter-productive militarised responses and/or futile inter-state negotiations. While the systemic causal context of global crisis convergence and acceleration is thus elided, this simultaneously exacerbates the danger of reactionary violence, the problematisation of populations in regions impacted by these crises and the naturalisation of the consequent proliferation of wars and humanitarian disasters. This moves us away from the debate over whether resource ’shortages* or ’abundance* causes conflicts, to the question of how either can generate crises which undermine conventional socio-political orders and confound conventional IR discourses, in turn radicalising the processes of social polarisation that can culminate in violent conflict.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4

class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>The theological origins of the lesser evil argument still cast a long shadow on the present. In fact the idiom has become so deeply ingrained, and is invoked in such a staggeringly diverse set of contexts - from individual situational ethics and international relations, to attempts to govern the economics of violence in the context of the war on terror’ and the efforts of human rights and humanitarian activists to maneuver through the paradoxes of aid - that it seems to have altogether taken the place previously reserved for the term "˜good’. Moreover, the very evocation of the "˜good’ seems to everywhere invoke the utopian tragedies of modernity, in which evil seemed lurking in a horrible manichaeistic inversion. If no hope is offered in the future, all that remains is to insure ourselves against the risks that it poses, to moderate and lessen the collateral effects of necessary acts, and tend to those who have suffered as a result. In relation to the "˜War on terror, the terms of the lesser evil were most clearly and prominently articulated by former human rights scholar and leader of Canada’s Liberal Party Michael Ignatieff. In his book The Lesser Evil Ignatieff suggested that in "˜balancing liberty against security’ liberal states establish mechanisms to regulate the breach of some human rights and legal norms, and allow their security services to engage in forms of extra juridical violence - which he saw as lesser evils - in order to fend off or minimize potential greater evils, such as terror attacks on civilians of western states. If governments need to violate rights in a terrorist emergency, this should be done, he thought, only as an exception and according to a process of adversarial scrutiny. "˜Exceptions’, Ignatieff states, "˜do not destroy the rule but save it, provided that they are temporary, publicly justified, and deployed as a last resort. The lesser evil emerges here as a pragmatic compromise a "tolerated sin" that functions as the very justification for the notion of exception. State violence in this model takes part in a necro-economy in which various types of destructive measure are weighed in a utilitarian fashion, not only in relation to the damage they produce, but to the harm they purportedly prevent and even in relation to the more brutal measures they may help restrain. In this logic, the problem of contemporary state violence resembles indeed an all-too-human version of the mathematical minimum problem of the divine calculations previously mentioned, one tasked with determining the smallest level of violence necessary to avert the greatest harm. For the architects of contemporary war this balance is trapped between two poles: keeping violence at a low enough level to limit civilian suffering, and at a level high enough to bring a decisive end to the war and bring peace. More recent works by legal scholars and legal advisers to states and militaries have sought to extend the inherent elasticity of the system of legal exception proposed by Ignatieff into ways of rewriting the laws of armed conflict themselves. Lesser evil arguments are now used to defend anything from targeted assassinations and mercy killings, house demolitions, deportation, torture, to the use of (sometimes) non~ lethal chemical weapons, the use of human shields, and even "˜the intentional targeting of some civilians if it could save more innocent lives than they cost. In one of its more macabre moments it was suggested that the atomic bombings of Hiroshima might also be tolerated under the defense of the lesser evil. Faced with a humanitarian A-bomb, one might wonder what, in fact, might come under the definition of a greater evil. Perhaps it is time for the differential accounting of the lesser evil to replace the mechanical bureaucracy of the "banality of evil’ as the idiom to describe the most extreme manifestations of violence. Indeed, it is through this use of the lesser evil that societies that see themselves as democratic can maintain regimes of occupation and neo-colonization. Beyond state agents, those practitioners of lesser evils, as this book claims, must also include the members of independent nongovernmental organizations that make up the ecology of contemporary war and crisis zones. The lesser evil is the argument of the humanitarian agent that seeks military permission to provide medicines and aid in places where it is in fact the duty of the occupying military power to do so, thus saving the military limited resources. The lesser evil is often the justification of the military officer who attempts to administer life (and death) in an "˜enlightened’ manner; it is sometimes, too, the brief of the security contractor who introduces new and more efficient weapons and spatio-technological means of domination, and advertises them as "˜humanitarian technology’. In these cases the logic of the lesser evil opens up a thick political field of participation bringing together otherwise opposing fields of action, to the extent that it might obscure the fundamental moral differences between these various groups. But, even according to the terms of an economy of losses mid gains, the concept of the lesser evil risks becoming counterproductive: less brutal measures are also those that may be more easily naturalized, accepted and tolerated - and hence more frequently used, with the result that a greater evil may be reached cumulatively</span></h4><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HTheaff2019sdescriptionofrapidchangeincentralAsiaisbasedonfalselinearscenariopredictions" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>The aff’s description of rapid change in central Asia is based on false linear scenario predictions</span></h4><p>Stone, University of Wales PhD, ’12<br/>(Leonard A., former visiting lecturer, Debrecen University, &nbsp;"Central Asia Studies" Journal of Third World Studies 29.1 Spring 2012 p. 175 via academic one file accessed: 2-19-14 mlb)</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>&nbsp;Central Asia is constantly reorganized and (re)presented by commentators such as <br/>AND<br/>relationship between the steppe and the oasis in Central Asia.

First, a near total failure to arrive at empirical conclusions derived from primary or first-hand research with the militants they define as ’terrorists’ or in the communities that supports them<sub>&nbsp;and a corresponding failure or refusal to look at the question from the participants point of view. These people’s views are rarely sought, and little effort is made to arrive at an empirical understanding of why they engage in or support political violence against the state. &nbsp;Second, their analyses and conclusions are based almost solely on mostly secondary information and interpretations provided by governments, intelligence agencies, and security’s forces actively involved in fighting the ’terrorists’ (see, also, Ranstorp and Raphael in this volume). &nbsp;This is not objective social science because no effort is made to establish the validity or verify the reliability of these mostly secondary data and interpretations received from ’official’ sources which it would be naïve or biased to accept at face value as objective and reliable. &nbsp;Third, they tend strongly to view the civilian populations which militants come from as being passive, ignorant, and manipulable, and as either ’terrorised’ dupes or ’terrorists supporters’. &nbsp;This preconceived notion shapes their fundamental approach, and yet no more attempt is made to establish its validity than is made to establish that of data and interpretation sreceived from ’official sources actively involved in counter-insurgency or counterterrorism. &nbsp;Fourth, not only do they generally approach their work from the perspective of those combating militants, there is nearly always an implicit moral assumption or judgement which reveals a state-centric bias, that states combating political militants they define as ’terrorists’ are inherently legitimate and moral (the ’good guys’) and the militants inherently illegitmate and immoral (evil, the ’bad guys’). &nbsp;There is rarely any suggestion that governments and security forces may be just as illegitmate, Machiavellian, cynical, and immoral in their use of violence, force, and terror as they generally presume the militants are, or that the violence of the militants is, from their perspective and usually an objective one as well, a reaction and form of resistance to their experiences of state terror, oppression, and injustice, which are among the root causes of anti-state violence.&nbsp;&nbsp;</sub></p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HThereisnostabledefinitionof2019terrorism2019andgovernmentelitesmanipulatethedefinitiontoservetheinterestsofstatepowerandthesecurityregime." class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>There is no stable definition of ’terrorism’ and government elites manipulate the definition to serve the interests of state power and the security regime.</span></h4><p>Hoffman, Director of the Security Studies Program at Georgetown University, 1998<br/>(Bruce, Professor at Georgetown University, "Inside Terrorism," The New York Times Company, Online, Written 1998, Accessed 07/31/2013, AJH)</p><p>What is terrorism?

The record of the 1990s has left both Russia and the United States unsatisfied. Russia looks back at the decade with bitterness and a feeling of being marginalized and slighted by the world’s sole remaining superpower. It is also disappointed by its experience with Western-style reforms and mistrustful of American intentions. The United States is equally disappointed with Russia’s lack of focus, inability to engage effectively abroad, and failure to implement major reforms at home. A comprehensive partnership is out of the question. Renewed competition or active containment are also not credible as organizing principles. Russia’s economic, military and political/ideological weakness makes it an unlikely target of either U.S. competition or containment. Not only is Russia no longer a superpower, but its status as a regional power is in doubt. Current thinking about Russia is divided among four basic approaches: Forget Russia, Enfant Terrible Russia, Evil Russia, and Russia First. The Forget Russia view holds that Russia is too weak, too corrupt, and too chaotic to matter. After 10 years of trying to help Russia, the United States should focus its resources and attention on more deserving and important world issues. The Enfant Terrible view holds that, although Russia has been an irresponsible and irritating partner, it is too weak to hurt the United States and therefore need not be feared in earnest. President Vladimir Putin’s visits to Cuba and North Korea, courtship of Slobodan Milosevic, and welcoming of Iranian President Mohammad Khatami to Moscow are of little strategic consequence and thus not worth our attention. This view presupposes the existence of an important U.S.-Russian bilateral agenda and the need to protect it from childish and irresponsible Russian grandstanding. The Evil Russia view holds that Russian courtship of Cuba, Iran, Iraq, and North Korea is a deliberate effort to undermine U.S. influence in the world and recreate the Soviet empire. Analysts embracing this view take less notice of Russia’s diminished capabilities than of ambitious rhetoric by Russian politicians. Given Russia’s evil purposes, the United States is already on a collision course with it and might as well do everything it can to box Russia in. The Russia First view holds that Russia still is the most important issue on the U.S. foreign policy agenda. It accepts the premise that the two sides have shared interests and that Russia, once reborn as a stable, prosperous democracy, can be a U.S. partner and ally. Therefore, the United States should actively assist Russia in its transformation and engage it in a broad and intense relationship with renewed vigor and creativity. There are shortcomings in all of these approaches. Notwithstanding its precipitous decline, to Forget Russia is clearly not an option: the country’s geographic expanse, nuclear arsenal, and proliferation potential simply make it impossible for U.S. policymakers to ignore. The Enfant Terrible view fails to take Russia seriously and ignores the very real problems that exist between the two countries. The Evil Russia view risks inflating the threat and making the myth of evil Russia a self-fulfilling prophecy. The Russia First view is not grounded in reality. After a decade of failure, it should be clear that neither the specter of Russia’s past nor the promise of its future warrants a position near the top of the U.S. foreign policy agenda. The Need for Normalcy Russia’s external weakness and internal problems have left the United States without an effective interlocutor, either as partner or competitor. Thus, the United States should deal with Russia on a case-by-case basis to advance our interests, in much the same way we deal with most other countries. This path will sometimes lead toward partnership with Russia and at other times toward competition. It may even result in a situation where Russia and the United States find themselves as partners and competitors simultaneously in different parts of the world or on different issues. Given its size, history, strategic nuclear capabilities, and future potential, one is tempted to overstate the importance of relations with Russia and put them at the top of the U.S. national security agenda. Except for geography and nuclear weapons, however, there is little at this stage to justify making relations with Russia a top priority. Undoubtedly, Russia can inflict unacceptable damage on the United States. But fear of Russian nuclear weapons should not be the driving element of the relationship. The hostility and ideological differences that divided the superpowers during the Cold War are gone. The prospect of Russia consolidating and rebuilding itself under a militant authoritarian, nationalist regime is remote. Therefore, fears of a deliberate surprise (attack on the United States are unjustified. Despite a number of bilateral undertakings outside the Cold War-style security agenda, &nbsp;ranging from regional diplomacy in the Balkans to investment, U.S. engagement with Russia, with the notable exception of the Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) Initiative, is limited.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HDiscursivelyconstructingChinaasathreattoU.S.securityessentializesandtotalizestheOther2Censuringthemaintenanceofasecurityparadigmandwar.-1" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Discursively constructing China as a threat to U.S. security essentializes and totalizes the Other, ensuring the maintenance of a security paradigm and war.</span></h4><p>Pan, Department of Political Science and International Relations, 04 <br/>(Chengxin Pan, Faculty of Arts, Australian National University, Canberra, 2004, "The ’China Threat’ in American Self-Imagination: The Discursive Construction of Other as Power Politics," Alternatives (29) 2004)</p><p>Having examined how the "China threat" literature is enabled by and serves the purpose of a particular U.S. self-construction, I want to turn now to the issue of how this literature represents a discursive construction of other, instead of an "objective" account of Chinese reality. This, I argue, has less to do with its portrayal of China as a threat per se than with its essentialization and totalization of China as an externally knowable object, independent of historically contingent contexts or dynamic international interactions. In this sense, the discursive construction of China as a threatening other cannot be detached from (neo)realism, a positivist, ahistorical framework of analysis within which global life is reduced to endless interstate rivalry for power and survival. As many critical IR scholars have noted, (neo)realism is not a transcendent description of global reality but is predicated on the modernist Western identity, which, in the quest for scientific certainty, has come to define itself essentially as the sovereign territorial nation-state. This realist self-identity of Western states leads to the constitution of anarchy as the sphere of insecurity, disorder, and war. In an anarchical system, as (neo)realists argue, "the gain of one side is often considered to be the loss of the other," (45) and "All other states are potential threats." (46) In order to survive in such a system, states inevitably pursue power or capability. In doing so, these realist claims represent what R. B. J. Walker calls "a specific historical articulation of relations of universality/particularity and self/Other." (47) The (neo)realist paradigm has dominated the U.S. IR discipline in general and the U.S. China studies field in particular. As Kurt Campbell notes, after the end of the Cold War, a whole new crop of China experts "are much more likely to have a background in strategic studies or international relations than China itself." (48) As a result, for those experts to know China is nothing more or less than to undertake a geopolitical analysis of it, often by asking only a few questions such as how China will "behave" in a strategic sense and how it may affect the regional or global balance of power, with a particular emphasis on China’s military power or capabilities. As Thomas J. Christensen notes, "Although many have focused on intentions as well as capabilities, the most prevalent component of the ~China threat~ debate is the assessment of China’s overall future military power compared with that of the United States and other East Asian regional powers." (49) Consequently, almost by default, China emerges as an absolute other and a threat thanks to this (neo)realist prism. The (neo)realist emphasis on survival and security in international relations dovetails perfectly with the U.S. self-imagination, because for the United States to define itself as the indispensable nation in a world of anarchy is often to demand absolute security. As James Chace and Caleb Carr note, "for over two centuries the aspiration toward an eventual condition of absolute security has been viewed as central to an effective American foreign policy." (50) And this self-identification in turn leads to the definition of not only "tangible" foreign powers but global contingency and uncertainty per se as threats. For example, former U.S. President George H. W. Bush repeatedly said that "the enemy ~of America~ is unpredictability. The enemy is instability." (51) Similarly, arguing for the continuation of U.S. Cold War alliances, a high-ranking Pentagon official asked, "if we pull out, who knows what nervousness will result?" (52) Thus understood, by its very uncertain character, China would now automatically constitute a threat to the United States. For example, Bernstein and Munro believe that "China’s political unpredictability, the always-present possibility that it will fall into a state of domestic disunion and factional fighting," constitutes a source of danger. (53) In like manner, Richard Betts and Thomas Christensen write: If the PLA ~People’s Liberation Army~ remains second-rate, should the world breathe a sigh of relief? Not entirely.... Drawing China into the web of global interdependence may do more to encourage peace than war, but it cannot guarantee that the pursuit of heartfelt political interests will be blocked by a fear of economic consequences.... U.S. efforts to create a stable balance across the Taiwan Strait might deter the use of force under certain circumstances, but certainly not all. (54) The upshot, therefore, is that since China displays no absolute certainty for peace, it must be, by definition, an uncertainty, and hence, a threat. In the same way, a multitude of other unpredictable factors (such as ethnic rivalry, local insurgencies, overpopulation, drug trafficking, environmental degradation, rogue states, the spread of weapons of mass destruction, and international terrorism) have also been labeled as "threats" to U.S. security. Yet, it seems that in the post-Cold War environment, China represents a kind of uncertainty par excellence. "Whatever the prospects for a more peaceful, more democratic, and more just world order, nothing seems more uncertain today than the future of post-Deng China," (55) argues Samuel Kim. And such an archetypical uncertainty is crucial to the enterprise of U.S. self-construction, because it seems that only an uncertainty with potentially global consequences such as China could justify U.S. indispensability or its continued world dominance. In this sense, Bruce Cumings aptly suggested in 1996 that China (as a threat) was basically "a metaphor for an enormously expensive Pentagon that has lost its bearings and that requires a formidable ’renegade state’ to define its mission (Islam is rather vague, and Iran lacks necessary weights)." (56) It is mainly on the basis of this self-fashioning that many U.S. scholars have for long claimed their "expertise" on China. For example, from his observation (presumably on Western TV networks) of the Chinese protest against the U.S. bombing of their embassy in Belgrade in May 1999, Robert Kagan is confident enough to speak on behalf of the whole Chinese people, claiming that he knows "the fact" of "what ~China~ really thinks about the United States." That is, "they consider the United States an enemy—or, more precisely, the enemy.... How else can one interpret the Chinese government’s response to the bombing?" he asks, rhetorically. (57) For Kagan, because the Chinese "have no other information" than their government’s propaganda, the protesters cannot rationally "know" the whole event as "we" do. Thus, their anger must have been orchestrated, unreal, and hence need not be taken seriously. (58) Given that Kagan heads the U.S. Leadership Project at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and is very much at the heart of redefining the United States as the benevolent global hegemon, his confidence in speaking for the Chinese "other" is perhaps not surprising. In a similar vein, without producing in-depth analysis, Bernstein and Munro invoke with great ease such all-encompassing notions as "the Chinese tradition" and its "entire three-thousand-year history." (59) In particular, they repeatedly speak of what China’s "real" goal is: "China is an unsatisfied and ambitious power whose goal is to dominate Asia.... China aims at achieving a kind of hegemony.... China is so big and so naturally powerful that ~we know~ it will tend to dominate its region even if it does not intend to do so as a matter of national policy." (60) Likewise, with the goal of absolute security for the United States in mind, Richard Betts and Thomas Christensen argue: The truth is that China can pose a grave problem even if it does not become a military power on the American model, does not intend to commit aggression, integrates into a global economy, and liberalizes politically. Similarly, the United States could face a dangerous conflict over Taiwan even if it turns out that Beijing lacks the capacity to conquer the island.... This is true because of geography; because of America’s reliance on alliances to project power; and because of China’s capacity to harm U.S. forces, U.S. regional allies, and the American homeland, even while losing a war in the technical, military sense. (61) By now, it seems clear that neither China’s capabilities nor intentions really matter. Rather, almost by its mere geographical existence, China has been qualified as an absolute strategic "other," a discursive construct from which it cannot escape. Because of this, "China" in U.S. IR discourse has been objectified and deprived of its own subjectivity and exists mainly in and for the U.S. self. Little wonder that for many U.S. China specialists, China becomes merely a "national security concern" for the United States, with the "severe disproportion between the keen attention to China as a security concern and the intractable neglect of China’s ~own~ security concerns in the current debate." (62) At this point, at issue here is no longer whether the "China threat" argument is true or false, but is rather its reflection of a shared positivist mentality among mainstream China experts that they know China better than do the Chinese themselves. (63) "We" alone can know for sure that they consider "us" their enemy and thus pose a menace to "us." Such an account of China, in many ways, strongly seems to resemble Orientalists’ problematic distinction between the West and the Orient. Like orientalism, the U.S. construction of the Chinese "other" does not require that China acknowledge the validity of that dichotomous construction. Indeed, as Edward Said point out, "It is enough for ’us’ to set up these distinctions in our own minds; ~and~ ’they’ become ’they’ accordingly." (64) It may be the case that there is nothing inherently wrong with perceiving others through one’s own subjective lens. Yet, what is problematic with mainstream U.S. China watchers is that they refuse to acknowledge the legitimacy of the inherent fluidity of Chinese identity and subjectivity and try instead to fix its ambiguity as absolute difference from "us," a kind of certainty that denotes nothing but otherness and threats. As a result, it becomes difficult to find a legitimate space for alternative ways of understanding an inherently volatile, amorphous China (65) or to recognize that China’s future trajectory in global politics is contingent essentially on how "we" in the United States and the West in general want to see it as well as on how the Chinese choose to shape it. (66) Indeed, discourses of "us" and "them" are always closely linked to how "we" as "what we are" deal with "them" as "what they are" in the practical realm. This is exactly how the discursive strategy of perceiving China as a threatening other should be understood, a point addressed in the following section, which explores some of the practical dimension of this discursive strategy in the containment perspectives and hegemonic ambitions of U.S. foreign policy</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HTheirassertionsofChinese22aggression22isanimperialist2Csecuritizedview2013itignoresthewaytheJapanesestoletheland2Cre-namedit2CandturneditovertotheUStocontrol2013independentlytheircallingitbyitsWesternname22Senkaku22legitimizesthetheftofthelandfromChina" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Their assertions of Chinese "aggression" is an imperialist, securitized view – it ignores the way the Japanese stole the land, re-named it, and turned it over to the US to control – independently their calling it by its Western name "Senkaku" legitimizes the theft of the land from China</span></h4><p>Shaw, Research Fellow, Research Center for International Legal Studies, National Chengchi University, Taiwan, 12 <br/>(Han-yi, "The Inconvenient Truth Behind the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands," 9-19-12, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/19/the-inconvenient-truth-behind-the-diaoyusenkaku-islands/?_php=true26_type=blogs26_r=0  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/19/the-inconvenient-truth-behind-the-diaoyusenkaku-islands/?_php=true26_type=blogs26_r=0%27" tppabs="http://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/19/the-inconvenient-truth-behind-the-diaoyusenkaku-islands/?_php=true26_type=blogs26_r=0"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/19/the-inconvenient-truth-behind-the-diaoyusenkaku-islands/?_php=true26_type=blogs26_r=0</span></a></span>, DOA: 2-23-14, ara)</p><p>I’ve had a longstanding interest in the Diaoyu/Senkaku islands, the subject of a dangerous territorial dispute between Japan and China. The United States claims to be neutral but in effect is siding with Japan, and we could be drawn in if a war ever arose. Let me clear that I deplore the violence in the recent anti-Japan protests in China: the violence is reprehensible and makes China look like an irrational bully. China’s government should rein in this volatile nationalism rather than feed it. This is a dispute that both sides should refer to the International Court of Justice, rather than allow to boil over in the streets. That said, when I look at the underlying question of who has the best claim, I’m sympathetic to China’s position. I don’t think it is 100 percent clear, partly because China seemed to acquiesce to Japanese sovereignty between 1945 and 1970, but on balance I find the evidence for Chinese sovereignty quite compelling. The most interesting evidence is emerging from old Japanese government documents and suggests that Japan in effect stole the islands from China in 1895 as booty of war. This article by Han-Yi Shaw, a scholar from Taiwan, explores those documents. I invite any Japanese scholars to make the contrary legal case. – Nicholas Kristof Japan’s recent purchase of the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands has predictably reignited tensions amongst China, Japan, and Taiwan. Three months ago, when Niwa Uichiro, the Japanese ambassador to China, warned that Japan’s purchase of the islands could spark an "extremely grave crisis" between China and Japan, Tokyo Governor Ishihara Shintaro slammed Niwa as an unqualified ambassador, who "needs to learn more about the history of his own country". Ambassador Niwa was forced to apologize for his remarks and was recently replaced. But what is most alarming amid these developments is that despite Japan’s democratic and pluralist society, rising nationalist sentiments are sidelining moderate views and preventing rational dialogue. The Japanese government maintains that the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands are Japanese territory under international law and historical point of view and has repeatedly insisted that no dispute exists. Despite that the rest of the world sees a major dispute, the Japanese government continues to evade important historical facts behind its unlawful incorporation of the islands in 1895. Specifically, the Japanese government asserts, "From 1885 on, our government conducted on-site surveys time and again, which confirmed that the islands were uninhabited and there were no signs of control by the Qing Empire." My research of over 40 official Meiji period documents unearthed from the Japanese National Archives, Diplomatic Records Office, and National Institute for Defense Studies Library clearly demonstrates that the Meiji government acknowledged Chinese ownership of the islands back in 1885. Following the first on-site survey, in 1885, the Japanese foreign minister wrote, "Chinese newspapers have been reporting rumors of our intention of occupying islands belonging to China located next to Taiwan.… At this time, if we were to publicly place national markers, this must necessarily invite China’s suspicion.…" In November 1885, the Okinawa governor confirmed "since this matter is not unrelated to China, if problems do arise I would be in grave repentance for my responsibility". "Surveys of the islands are incomplete" wrote the new Okinawa governor in January of 1892. He requested that a naval ship Kaimon be sent to survey the islands, but ultimately a combination of miscommunication and bad weather made it impossible for the survey to take place. "Ever since the islands were investigated by Okinawa police agencies back in 1885, there have been no subsequent field surveys conducted," the Okinawa governor wrote in 1894. After a number of Chinese defeats in the Sino-Japanese War, a report from Japan’s Home Ministry said "this matter involved negotiations with China… but the situation today is greatly different from back then." The Meiji government, following a cabinet decision in early 1895, promptly incorporated the islands. Negotiations with China never took place and this decision was passed during the Sino-Japanese War. It was never made public. In his biography Koga Tatsushiro, the first Japanese citizen to lease the islands from the Meiji government, attributed Japan’s possession of the islands to "the gallant military victory of our Imperial forces." Collectively, these official documents leave no doubt that the Meiji government did not base its occupation of the islands following "on-site surveys time and again," but instead annexed them as booty of war. This is the inconvenient truth that the Japanese government has conveniently evaded. Japan asserts that neither Beijing nor Taipei objected to U.S. administration after WWII. That’s true, but what Japan does not mention is that neither Beijing nor Taipei were invited as signatories of the San Francisco Peace Treaty in 1951, from which the U.S. derived administrative rights. When Japan annexed the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands in 1895, it detached them from Taiwan and placed them under Okinawa Prefecture. Moreover, the Japanese name "Senkaku Islands" itself was first introduced in 1900 by academic Kuroiwa Hisashi and adopted by the Japanese government thereafter. Half a century later when Japan returned Taiwan to China, both sides adopted the 1945 administrative arrangement of Taiwan, with the Chinese unaware that the uninhabited "Senkaku Islands" were in fact the former Diaoyu Islands. This explains the belated protest from Taipei and Beijing over U.S. administration of the islands after the war. The Japanese government frequently cites two documents as evidence that China did not consider the islands to be Chinese. The first is an official letter from a Chinese consul in Nagasaki dated May 20, 1920 that listed the islands as Japanese territory. Neither Beijing nor Taipei dispute that the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands — along with the entire island of Taiwan — were formally under Japanese occupation at the time. However, per post-WW II arrangements, Japan was required to surrender territories obtained from aggression and revert them to their pre-1895 legal status. The second piece evidence is a Chinese map from 1958 that excludes the Senkaku Islands from Chinese territory. But the Japanese government’s partial unveiling leaves out important information from the map’s colophon: "certain national boundaries are based on maps compiled prior to the Second Sino-Japanese War(1937-1945)." Qing period (1644-1911) records substantiate Chinese ownership of the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands prior to 1895. Envoy documents indicate that the islands reside inside the "border that separates Chinese and foreign lands." And according to Taiwan gazetteers, "Diaoyu Island accommodates ten or more large ships" under the jurisdiction of Kavalan, Taiwan. The right to know is the bedrock of every democracy. The Japanese public deserves to know the other side of the story. It is the politicians who flame public sentiments under the name of national interests who pose the greatest risk, not the islands themselves.&nbsp;</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HTheirpeacekeepingadvantagereliesonflawedtop-downmodelsofdevelopmentthatresultsinstructuralviolence-1" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Their peacekeeping advantage relies on flawed top-down models of development that results in structural violence</span></h4><p>Newman, Birmingham political science senior lecturer, 2011<br/>(Edward, "A Human Security Peace-Building Agenda", Third World Quarterly, 32.10, project muse, ldg)</p><p>&nbsp;However, the record of peace building in terms of promoting durable and positive peace—based on sustainable economic growth, service delivery, selfsustaining institutions, inclusive democratic practices, personal security and the rule of law—has been much less positive, and perhaps even poor. The consequences, such as social unrest, political stagnation or volatility, weak state institutions, and the threat of insecurity, can be seen in Bosnia, East Timor, Kosovo, Coˆ te d’Ivoire, Sierra Leone and elsewhere. The reasons for such shortcomings, insofar as the role of the international peace-building and development community is concerned, may be found in two areas. First, the rationale behind the international peace-building agenda is increasingly driven by the belief that stability in fragile states is an international security imperative. Second, there are problems related to the liberal institutionalist models that guide the formulation and implementation of peace building in post-conflict settings. The next section will explore these themes. Despite noble intentions, peace building by international actors has often resulted in a heavy reliance on top-down approaches and—according to &nbsp;some observers—a lack of sensitivity towards local needs and desires. More importantly, although the importance of local ownership has been increasingly emphasised, there is still very limited knowledge or research about local opinions, perceptions and experiences that shape or react to externally led peace-building processes. The argument of this article is that these shortcomings cannot, as is usually done, be dismissed as an ’acceptable’ short-term limitation, peripheral to the overall objectives of peace building, namely, to maintain stability. Human insecurity—deprivation, alienation, exclusion—is a direct threat to peace-building processes and objectives, since these undermine the legitimacy of peace building and fuel the underlying sources of conflict. Indeed, the implication of a human security approach to peace building is that the overall integrity of peace-building and reconstruction projects is ultimately related to the everyday experience of individuals and communities, including their material well-being. &nbsp;A key problem which helps to explain why many of the objectives of sustainable peace building appear to be elusive relates to the motivations which drive these international interventions. There is wide—though not uncontested— agreement that unstable and conflict-prone societies pose a threat to international security and stability. Many analysts, especially after 9/11, now consider these situations as the primary security challenge of the contemporary era. Theories of conflict and instability also increasingly point to the weakness of the state as a key factor in the onset of violent conflict, and a merging of the security and development agendas.5 Among foreign policy elites this is a paradigm shift in security thinking: challenges to security ’come not from rival global powers, but from weak states’.6 According to Fukuyama, ’weak and failing states have arguably become the single most important problem for international order’.7 The 2008 UK National Security Strategy—and many other sources within or close to policy circles—reflects similar thinking, arguing that a key driver of global insecurity in the contemporary world is poverty, inequality and poor governance. 8 &nbsp;It is debatable whether this view reflects ’reality’ or is rather a political construction.9 Nevertheless, greater efforts and resources have been forthcoming from powerful states to contain, resolve and to some extent prevent civil war. One analyst has therefore suggested that addressing failing and conflict-prone states has ’become one of the critical all-consuming strategic and moral imperatives of our terrorised time’.10 &nbsp;In recent years international peace-building activities in conflict-prone and post-conflict countries have increased in number and in complexity in line with this evolving security discourse. These activities have also become an exercise in state building, based upon the assumption that effective (preferably liberal) states form the greatest prospect for a stable international order. Peace building is therefore a part of the security agenda insofar as the pathologies of conflict-prone and underdeveloped states have been constructed as international threats.11 Viewing conflict, weak statehood and &nbsp;underdevelopment as a threat to international security has brought muchneeded resources, aid and capacity building to conflict-prone countries in the form of international assistance. This has arguably contributed to a reduction in the absolute numbers of civil wars and the consolidation of peace in many countries. &nbsp;However, ’peace building as security’ has also generated a number of critical challenges. This approach translates into peace-building policies which often ignore the underlying sources of conflict because the emphasis is upon stability and containment, rather than conflict resolution. It also results in conditional and coercive forms of peace-building assistance—most obviously for example in Bosnia and East Timor but more subtly in many other contexts. When international stability becomes the priority, rather than addressing local conflict or demands for justice, international peace building tends to rely on top-down mediation among power brokers and on building state institutions, rather than on bottom-up, community-driven peace building or the resolution of the underlying sources of conflict. Instead of promoting a sense of social justice and reconciliation, this can perpetuate the influence of sectarian leaders because international peace-building actors believe that the latter must be engaged with as the key to local control—a part of the ’facts on the ground’. This excludes or obstructs the emergence of alternative—potentially more conciliatory and cosmopolitan—leaders and civil society, and thus alternative visions of peace. &nbsp;The peace-building agenda itself often becomes an externally (often donor) driven exercise, because it is ultimately oriented towards the promotion of stability, often without a genuine understanding of local political culture, desires or needs. As a result, this approach can be insensitive towards—and exclude from the peace-building agenda—local traditions and institutions. Indeed, there are numerous reports of local opposition and civil society initiatives being discouraged by international peace-building agents because they apparently do not fit the ’agenda’.12 There is also evidence of peacebuilding actors—especially major UN operations—failing to recognise traditional social and political institutions in the countries in which they are working.13 Peace building is often reduced to a technical exercise, the implication being that peace-building assistance is essentially value-free and that it does not represent important choices and interests. Yet the apolitical model of peace building can miss the reality on the ground and fail to create conditions conducive to durable stability. Moreover, in this context there is a danger that state building may undermine traditional indigenous authority structures.14 This may be morally questionable and illegitimate, but also, if the new centralised agendas fail to take root, instability and conflict can ensue (as in East Timor in 2006). This raises the question: is the liberal peace being promoted in societies, such as Sierra Leone, East Timor and Coˆ te d’Ivoire, in which it may, for social or cultural reasons, be fundamentally inappropriate? &nbsp;The mixed record of peace building is therefore hostage to its prevailing rationale to promote strong states and contain conflict as a matter of international security, rather than to resolve conflicts or address its underlying sources. This is not to disparage the value of stability and ’negative’ peace: &nbsp;the ending of violence and establishing stability is a great achievement, and clearly the prerequisite to any further peace-building and reconstruction objectives. As noted above, it is not inconceivable that international peacebuilding interventions have contributed to a historical downward trend in the recurrence of intra-state conflict. Many policy analysts, in particular, would argue that the promotion of stability in conflict-prone societies is the realistic extent of what international peace-building can achieve. However, there is ample evidence that a negative peace can be a fragile peace; research shows that conflict is often recurrent in societies that have experienced conflict in the past, and this remains the case, despite the apparent downtrend in armed conflict.15 The tendency for international peace building to emphasise stability through brokering elite bargaining has meant that the sources of conflict—and the overall atmosphere of sectarianism in public life—have been perpetuated, which in the worst cases can make ’peace’ fragile. Although international peace building is often described as ’liberal’, this may be a misnomer. Is international peace building truly ’liberal’ when (in terms of conflict resolution) it tends to mediate—from the top down—between local power brokers, who are often politically extremist or exclusionary, and does not—despite the civil society empowerment programmes that are invariably a part of peace-building activities— sufficiently engage with grassroots community actors who are potentially more inclusive and moderate? Thus, the essential mechanism of a liberal social contract is generally absent in post-conflict states, which instead are held together by external actors. This also obstructs more progressive bottom-up forms of peace building that cultivate cosmopolitan peaceful forces and address underlying sources of conflict. So-called liberal peace building is indeed premised upon the idea of democracy, the free market and state institutions, yet the emphasis upon stability and security seems more akin to the promotion of a strong Hobbesian state than a Lockean liberal contract, because this serves international stability, an important objective of international peace-building activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HModelingofUSnormsisanemptyconcept2013itprovidespoliticalcoverforwesterninterventionismthatproducesstructuralviolence-1" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Modeling of US norms is an empty concept – it provides political cover for western interventionism that produces structural violence</span></h4><p>Mattei, Law Professor-Hastings University, 2009<br/>(Ugo, BOCCONI SCHOOL OF LAW, GLOBAL LAW 26 PLUNDER: THE DARK SIDE OF THE RULE OF LAW, 2009, URL, ,DOA: 3-25-14, CEJ)</p><p>What we can identify as ’global law’ is not a single and coherent system of law drawing legitimacy from a well-defined legal and political process. Rather, a mixture of international and transnational instruments and processes—non-democratic institutional settings, power/force relationships and ethnocentric intellectual attitudes—stand behind the legal rules that are adopted by public and private actors at the global and (consequently)2 at the local level. This is not a new phenomenon, although its magnitude has recently been increasing. Within this framework, Western law has constantly enjoyed a dominant position during the past centuries and today, thus being in the position to shape and bend the evolution of other legal systems worldwide. &nbsp;During the colonial era, continental Europe powers have systematically exported their own legal systems to the colonized lands. &nbsp;During the past decades and today, the United States have been dominating the international arena as the most powerful economic power, exporting their own legal system to the periphery, both by itself and through a set of international instituions, behaving as a neo-colonialist within the ideology known as neoliberalism. &nbsp;Western countries identify themselves as law-abiding and civilized no matter what their actual history reveals. Such identification is acquired by false knowledge and false comparison with other peoples, those who were said to ’lack’ the rule of law, such as China, Japan, India, and the Islamic world more generally. In a similar fashion today, according to some leading economists, Third World developing countries ’lack’ the minimal institutional systems necessary for the unfolding of a market economy. The theory of ’lack’ and the rhetoric of the rule of law have justified aggressive interventions from Western countries into non-Western ones. The policy of corporatization and open markets, supported today globally by the so-called Washington consensus3 , was used by Western bankers and the business community in Latin America as the main vehicle to ’open the veins’ of the continent—to borrow Eduardo Galeano’s metaphor4—with no solution of continuity between colonial and post-colonial times. Similar policy was used in Africa to facilitate the forced transfer of slaves to America, and today to facilitate the extraction of agricultural products, oil, minerals, ideas and cultural artifacts in the same countries. The policy of opening markets for free trade, used today in Afghanistan and Iraq, was used in China during the nineteenth century Opium War, in which free trade was interpreted as an obligation to buy drugs from British dealers. The policy of forcing local industries to compete on open markets was used by the British empire in Bengal, as it is today by the WTO in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Foreign-imposed privatization laws that facilitate unconscionable bargains at the expense of the people have been vehicles of plunder, not of legality. In all these settings the tragic human suffering produced by such plunder is simply ignored. In this context law played a major role in legalizing such practices of powerful actors against the powerless.5 Yet, this use of power is scarcely explored in the study of Western law. The exportation of Western legal institutions from the West to the ’rest’ has systematically been justified through the ideological use of the extremely politically strong and technically weak concept of ’rule of law’. The notion of ’rule of law’ is an extremely ambiguous one. Notwithstanding, within any public discussion its positive connotations have always been taken for granted. The dominant image of the rule of law is false both historically and in the present, because it does not fully acknowledge its dark side. The false representation starts from the idea that good law (which others ’lack’) is autonomous, separate from society and its institutions, technical, non-political, non-distributive and reactive rather than proactive: more succinctly, a technological framework for an ’efficient’ market. The rule of law has a bright and a dark side, with the latter progressively conquering new ground whenever the former is not empowered by a political soul. In the absence of such political life, the rule of law becomes a cold technology. Moreover, when large corporate actors dominate states (affected by a declining regulatory role), law becomes a product of the economy, and economy governs the law rather than being governed by it. Contemporary mass cultures operate within a short time-span. Most intellectuals do not acknowledge that it is exactly because of plunder of gold, silver, bioresources and so on that development accelerated in the West, so that underdevelopment is a historically produced victimization of weaker and more enclosed communities and not the disease of lesser people. Prevailing short-term and short-sighted opportunism must be overcome. An analysis of the imperial adventure rendered in legal terms opens up a possibility for a radical rethinking of a model of development defined by Western ideas of progress, development and economic efficiency. A reconfiguration would mean, first and foremost, a clear rejection of an ideology of inherent superiority of Western culture that does not recognize that the West is itself part of something much larger.&nbsp;</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HLegalmodelingproduceseconomicinequalityandpoverty2Cwhichensuresbacklashthatgutssolvency" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Legal modeling produces economic inequality and poverty, which ensures backlash that guts solvency</span></h4><p>Tamanaha, Professor of law at Hammond, 2008<br/>(Brian, "The Dark Side of the Relationship Between the Rule of Law and Liberalism," Exact Date, URL, DOA: 3-25-14, CEJ)</p><p>Despite positioning themselves as defenders of liberty -a claim that is merited on its own terms - this article has shown a consistent pattern of liberals in the classical vein trying to prevent, narrow, invalidate, or discredit democratically produced legislation that seeks to redistribute property or temper market mechanisms to further competing aims. At the turn of the 20th century this was evident in the actions of U.S. courts that struck or narrowed social welfare and labor legislation; at the turn of the 21st century this is evident in the neoliberal package of reforms imposed on developing countries seeking aid.123 For anyone who sees democracy -the exercise of political choice over one’s affairs - as an expression of liberty, this side of liberalism involves persistent attempts to invoke the rule of law to restrict the exercise of political liberty. This is the dark side of the rule of law within liberal theory. Those in the West who find solace in the fact that developing countries have thus far suffered the brunt of the aforementioned anti-democratic imposition of neoliberal reforms are perhaps unduly optimistic in thinking they have escaped a similar fate. This very same process, with similar anti-democratic tendencies, is taking place writ large around the globe as the imperatives of market capitalism increasingly dictate policies to national governments. 124 The "great transformation" Polanyi described involved the market coming to occupy the dominant organizing position within capitalist societies. 125 We may well be witnessing the completion of this transformation, not just in the sense that every individual nation comes to be organized in this fashion, but in the further sense that the entire community of nations (the global order) is increasingly organized in the same terms. Liberal mechanisms and institutions functioning at the transnational level (for example, the World Trade Organization) are already coalescing into a de facto kind of "economic constitutionalism" which, through the operation of the rule of law, constrains, overrides, and dictates to domestic law making in connection with liberal economic matters (affecting property rights, tariffs, subsidies, efforts to protect jobs). In the past, natural law, the common law, and constitutional provisions provided the controlling norms that were enforced by the rule of law. In the future, if current developments bear out, it will be unadulterated liberal economic norms that control world-wide. Liberals will view this prospect happily, but individuals and societies that prefer other values above (or equal to) material improvement will find it alienating and disempowering. There is also a dark side for the rule of law in this relationship. As I have argued elsewhere, 126 the rule of law originated prior to liberalism and can exist independent of liberalism. Liberals tend to obscure this in their jealous identification of the rule of law with liberalism. From a broader perspective, the singular achievement of the rule of law is its insistence that governments must act in accordance with the law -an essential restraint that is valuable in all societies regardless of their social, cultural, economic, or political orientation. In view of the awesome power and resources governments can wield, holding the government to legal restraints is a universal good. The risk in recent developments is that the rule of law is ripe to be tainted by its close identification with liberalism, particularly in developing countries. A number of these countries have suffered from the adverse consequences of neoliberal reforms; 127 the disparity in wealth has increased to new heights in many countries, without any evident improvement for the poor majority;’ 28 and in many of these societies the populace had little say over whether to accept or modify these reforms. International development organizations now divert money away from infrastructure projects in favor of rule of law projects, like training judges and police, and drafting and implementing legal codes that protect property and foreign investment. In all these various activities, the "rule of law" is put forth as the "front man" for the liberal package. If this initiative goes badly in any number of possible ways owing to an innumerable complex of local and global factors, as seems likely to occur in many places, if substantial pain is suffered without the promised economic benefits to the general public, if courts are perceived to defend the rich who enjoy increasing wealth while most in society are left wanting, the rule of law may be held responsible or tarnished, viewed by the populace with suspicion or cynicismmaking it all the harder to implant and build the rule of law. It would be a tragic paradox if the great liberal advocates for the rule of law contributed to preventing it from taking hold and spreading around the world.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>The impact is heteronormative violence coalesced around the drive for ontological certainty.

In this organic notion of governmentality, it makes sense to differentiate interests in order to place them under different forms of control that can be generally subsumed under a governing body whose legitimacy is staged through the appearance of consent in democratic representation. Here, "politics" is equated with state management and the direct process of achieving representation (elections, certainly, but also hiring power-"affirmative action"-through elective prositions assert power under the illusion of representativeness). The "social" means issues affecting daily life, extrarepresentational issues like equitable distribution of resources ("poverty"), the environment, and "lifestyle." If the modern state’s business was to legitimate its existence in the absence of theological justification, to produce itself as a visible, secular, central organizational force Focault describes so well, then the postmodern state seems concerned to recede so well, then the postmodern state seems concerned to recede from visibility, to operate blindly as a purely administrative apparatus to an apparent market democracy. If the modern state had to describe its existence in terms of reason, suggesting in one way or another that it was an outcome of the social contract, capable of organizing consent and policing deviation, the postmodern state has to pose itself as capable of administering an incoherent, incommensurable plurality of interests. The modern state integrates social factions to resolve conflict; the postmodern state holds pluralities apart. Instead of invoking an organicist logic that links the nation to the individual through increasingly smaller collectives like the province, the township, and the family, the postmodern state proposes lateral linkages, communities or consumption units held in relations to one another and operating through commercial logic of a free market that circulates rather than negotiates freedoms. If modernity conceived power in blocks that operate entropically, postmodern power circulates, disperses, intensifies. The fields of power operative in postmondernity may be more importantly about the constitution of governable subjectivities than they area about the constitution of a governing state. Certainly, the two are connected, ideologically and practically. However, the crucial difference lies in the constution of identities: it may be that essentialist and social constructionist claims are unadjudicable because a accession to power-the constituion of governmentality-is now accomplished through, rather than precondition of, making good on claims to identity. The crucial battle now for "minorities" and resistant subalterns is not achieving democratic representation but wresting control over the discourses concerning identity construction. The opponent is not the state as much as it is the other collectives attempting to set the rules for identity constitution in something like a "civil society." The problem is not one of cognitive or psychic dissonance-that is, that the right, for example, will not allow us to feel or be who we want to be, but that the terms for asserting identity are categories of political engagement. The discursive practices of identity and the actors who activate them produce the categories of governmentatlity that engender the administrative state apparatus, not vice versa. It is as important to look at the battles taking place within the field of power in which accomplishment of "identities" operates as political capital-say, between the right and gays-as it is see how their variously constituted identities interact with the administrative units. Thus, identity as an effect comes into play at the threshold of what de Certeau, following Derrida, calls the "proper," at the threshold of engagement with constituted social and political instutions. As I have tried to show, this narrow sense of identity involves perfomrativity, the ability to operate through citation within a field of power in which oppositional pairs are discernible against a backdrop of instutions and spaces. Insitutions could be history or the courts, and spaces could be the social, gender, the nation. This is the place in which the new right invokes homophobia but a homophobia contingent on the continued construction of isolatable "gay identities." If agents in possession of gay identities make demands for minority status within the political sphere, this is not because acquisition of gay identity strips away ideology and allows for a homosexual body to realize its desire for civil rights are simply waiting around for the asking. Rather, the demand for civil rights is an intrinsic effect of coming-out rhetoric, altering both the meaning of civil rights and the meaning of homoerotic practices. Coming-out rhetoric, in effect articulates gay identity to civil rights practices, articulates homoerotic practices to the political concept of minority. The person who takes up a post-Stonewall identity feels compelled to act in a way that will constitute her or himself as a subject appropriate to civil rights discourse, and thus, deserving of the status accruing to successful claims to minority status. In the process of queer enunciation, the meaning of civil rights, indeed, capacity to hold apart the political and social, the public and private, have been radically altered. The innovation of gay identity was not so much in making homosexuality seem acceptable to the homosexual, but in creating a crisis of duty in gays who could "come out" (in some sense leave the private/social). In linking the demand for acceptance by society with the instantiation of identity in oneself, gay liberationists want society to take a stand for or against specific or specifiably "gay" persons. All identities effect these deontic closures: in fact, as I have argued above, the achievement of identites is precisely the staking out of duties and alliances in a field of power. Postmodern mininarratives of individual and collective moral legitimacy are replacing the rational metanarratives-like the social contract, pluralism, and democracy-that characterized state legitimation in modernity</p><p>The invisible center of norms for which heteronormativity is able to take charge and cause the normalization of the queers. This allows for the continued domination, marginalization, and eradication of individuals not seen as fit to be within its framework.<br/>Yep, Professor of Communication Studies at San Francisco State University, 2004. (Gust A., Ph.D. in Communication., Queer Theory and Communication: From Disciplining Queers to Queering the Discipline(s), pg. 18). Jt&nbsp;</p><p>In this passage, Simmons vividly describes the devastating persuasiveness of hatred and violence in her daily life based on being seen, perceived, labeled, and treated as an "Other." This process of othering creates individuals, groups, and communities that are deemed to be less important, less worthwhile, less consequential, less authorized, and less human based on historically situated markers of social formation such as race, class, gender, sexuality, ability, and nationality. Othering and marginalization are results of an "invisible center" (Ferguson, 1990, p.3). The authority, position, and power of such a center are attained through normalization in an ongoing circular movement. Normalization is the process of constructing, establishing, producing, and reproducing a taken-for-granted and all-encompassing standard used to measure goodness, desirability, morality, rationality, superiority, and a host of other dominant cultural values. As such, normalization becomes one of the primary instruments of power in modern society (Foucault, 1978/1990). Normalization is a symbolically, discursively, psychically, psychologically, and materially violent form of social regulation and control, or as Warner (1993) more simply puts it, normalization is "the site of violence" (p.xxvi). Perhaps one of the most powerful forms of normalization in Western social systems is heteronormativity. Through heteronormative discourses, abject and abominable bodies, souls, persons, and life forms are created, examined, and disciplined through current regimes of knowledge and power (Foucault, 1978/1990). Heteronormativity, as the invisible center and the presumed bedrock of society, is the quintessential force creating, sustaining, marginalization, disempowerment, and oppression of sexual others. Heternormativity is ubiquitous in all spheres of social life yet remains largely invisible and elusive. According to Berlant and Warner (in Warner, 2002), heteronormativity refers to: "the institutions, structures of understanding, and practical orientations that make heterosexuality seem not only coherent – that is, organized as a sexuality – but also a privileged. Its coherence is always provisional, and its privilege can take several (sometimes cotradictory) forms: unmarked as the basic idiom of the personal and the social; of marked as natural state; or projected as an ideal or moral accomplishment. It consists less of norms that could be summarized as a body of doctrine than of a sense of rightness produced in contradictory manifestations – often unconscious, immanent to practive or to institutions. (pg 309, my emphasis). Heteronormativity makes heterosexuality hegemonic through the process of normalization. Although it is experienced consciously or unconsciously and with different degrees of pain and suffering, this process of normalization is a site of violence in the lives of women, men, and transgenders – across the spectrum of sexualities – in modern Western Societies. Not unlike the experiences of children who must learn to survive in an emotionally and physically abusive environment where violence is the recipe for daily existence (Miller, 1990), 1991, 1998, 2001), individuals living in the heteronormative regime used to learn to conform, ignore, and banish their suffering to survive. The process of coping by repressing the pain and identifying with the perpetrator is, in my view, a powerful mechanism for heteronormativity to perpetuate itself in current forms of social organization. Drawing from the work of feminists and womanists, critical scholars, and mental health researchers, I identify and examine the injurious and violent nature of heteronormativity in this section. For purposes of discussion, I focus on the violence of heteronormativity enacted upon: (a) women inside the heteronormative borders, (b) men inside the heteronormative borders, (c) lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgendered, and queer people and (d) individuals living at the intersections of race, class, gender, and sexuality.&nbsp;</p><p>The alternative is to vote negative to embrace a politics of illegibility.

Their essay is a searing critique directed at the intellectual and the critical intellectual, the professional scholar and the "critical academic professionals." For Moten and Harney, the critical academic is not the answer to encroaching professionalization but an extension of it, using the very same tools and legitimating strategies to become "an ally of professional education." Moten and Harney prefer to pitch their tent with the "subversive intellectuals," a maroon community of outcast thinkers who refuse, resist, and renege on the demands of "rigor," "excellence," and "productivity." They tell us to "steal from the university," to "steal the enlightenment for others" (112), and to act against "what Foucault called the Conquest, the unspoken war that founded, and with the force of law refounds, society" (113). And what does the undercommons of the university want to be? It wants to constitute an unprofessional force of fugitive knowers, with a set of intellectual practices not bound by examination systems and test scores. The goal for this unprofessionalization is not to abolish; in fact Moten and Harney set the fugitive intellectual against the elimination or abolition of this, the founding or refounding of that: "Not so much the abolition of prisons but the abolition of a society that could have prisons, that could have slavery, that could have the wage, and therefore not abolition as the elimination of anything but abolition as the founding of a new society" (113). Not the elimination of anything but the founding of a new society. And why not? Why not think in terms of a different kind of society than the one that first created and then abolished slavery? The social worlds we inhabit, after all, as so many thinkers have reminded us, are not in &nbsp;evitable; they were not always bound to turn out this way, and what’s more, in the process of producing this reality, many other realities, fields of knowledge, and ways of being have been discarded and, to cite Foucault again, "disqualified." A few visionary books, produced alongside disciplinary knowledge, show us the paths not taken. For example, in a book that itself began as a detour, Seeing Like a State: How Certain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition Have Failed (1999), James C. Scott details the ways the modern state has run roughshod over local, customary, and undisciplined forms of knowledge in order to rationalize and simplify social, agricultural, and political practices that have profit as their primary motivation. In the process, says Scott, certain ways of seeing the world are established as normal or natural, as obvious and necessary, even though they are often entirely counterintuitive and socially engineered. Seeing Like a State began as a study of "why the state has always seemed to be the enemy of ’people who move around,’" but quickly became a study of the demand by the state for legibility through the imposition of methods of standardization and uniformity (1). While Dean Spade (2008) and other queer scholars use Scott’s book to think about how we came to insist upon the documentation of gender identity on all governmental documentation, I want to use his monumental study to pick up some of the discarded local knowledges that are trampled underfoot in the rush to bureaucratize and rationalize an economic order that privileges profit over all kinds of other motivations for being and doing &nbsp;In place of the Germanic ordered forest that Scott uses as a potent metaphor for the start of the modern imposition of bureaucratic order upon populations, we might go with the thicket of subjugated knowledge that sprouts like weeds among the disciplinary forms of knowledge, threatening always to overwhelm the cultivation and pruning of the intellect with mad plant life. For Scott, to "see like a state" means to accept the order of things and to internalize them; it means that we begin to deploy and think with the logic of the superiority of orderliness and that we erase and indeed sacrifice other, more local practices of knowledge, practices moreover that may be less efficient, may yield less marketable results, but may also, in the long term, be more sustaining. What is at stake in arguing for the trees and against the forest? Scott identifies "legibility" as the favored technique of high modernism for sorting, organizing, and profiting from land and people and for abstracting systems of knowledge from local knowledge practices. He talks about the garden and gardeners as representative of a new spirit of intervention and order favored within high modernism, and he points to the minimalism and simplicity of Le Corbusier’s urban design as part of a new commitment to symmetry and division and planning that complements authoritarian preferences for hierarchies and despises the complex and messy forms of organic profusion and improvised creativity. "Legibility," writes Scott, "is a condition of manipulation" (1999: 183). He favors instead, borrowing from European anarchist thought, more practical forms of knowledge that he calls metis and that emphasize mutuality, collectivity, plasticity, diversity, and adaptability. Illegibility may in fact be one way of escaping the political manipulation to which all university fields and disciplines are subject. While Scott’s insight about illegibility has implications for all kinds of subjects who are manipulated precisely when they become legible and visible to the state (undocumented workers, visible queers, racialized minorities), it also points to an argument for antidisciplinarity in the sense that knowledge practices that refuse both the form and the content of traditional canons may lead to unbounded forms of speculation, modes of thinking that ally not with rigor and order but with inspiration and unpredictability. We may in fact want to think about how to see unlike a state; we may want new rationales for knowledge production, different aesthetic standards for ordering or disordering space, other modes of political engagement than those conjured by the liberal imagination. We may, ultimately, want more undisciplined knowledge, more questions and fewer answers.&nbsp;</p><p>Prefer rogue intellectualism – ’rigorous’ studies reify dominant discourses<br/>Halberstam, USC American Studies, Ethnicity Studies, and Comparative Literature Professor, ’11<br/>(Judith, Phd University of Minnesota, "The Queer Art of Failure" 2011 ebook. &nbsp;Accessed 12-20-13 mlb)</p><p>&nbsp;Any book that begins with a quote from SpongeBob SquarePants and is motored by wisdom gleaned from Fantastic Mr. Fox, Chicken Run, and Finding Nemo, among other animated guides to life, runs the risk of not being taken seriously. Yet this is my goal. Being taken seriously means missing out on the chance to be frivolous, promiscuous, and irrelevant. The desire to be taken seriously is precisely what compels people to follow the tried and true paths of knowledge production around which I would like to map a few detours. Indeed terms like serious and rigorous tend to be code words, in academia as well as other contexts, for disciplinary correctness; they signal a form of training and learning that confirms what is already known according to approved methods of knowing, but they do not allow for visionary insights or flights of fancy. Training of any kind, in fact, is a way of refusing a kind of Benjaminian relation to knowing, a stroll down uncharted streets in the "wrong" direction (Benjamin 1996); it is precisely about staying in well- lit territories and about knowing exactly which way to go before you set out. Like many others before me, I propose that instead the goal is to lose one’s way, and indeed to be prepared to lose more than one’s way. Losing, we may agree with Elizabeth Bishop, is an art, and one "that is not too hard to master / Though it may look like a disaster" (2008: 166–167). &nbsp;In the sciences, particularly physics and mathematics, there are many examples of rogue intellectuals, not all of whom are reclusive Unabomber types (although more than a few are just that), who wander off into uncharted territories and refuse the academy because the publish- or- perish pressure of academic life keeps them tethered to conventional knowledge production and its well- traveled byways. Popular mathematics books, for example, revel in stories about unconventional loners who are selfschooled and who make their own way through the world of numbers. For some kooky minds, disciplines actually get in the way of answers and theorems precisely because they offer maps of thought where intuition and blind fumbling might yield better results. In 2008, for example, The New Yorker featured a story about an oddball physicist who, like many ambitious physicists and mathematicians, was in hot pursuit of a grand theory, a "theory of everything." This thinker, Garrett Lisi, had dropped &nbsp;out of academic physics because string theory dominated the field at that time and he thought the answers lay elsewhere. As an outsider to the discipline, writes Benjamin Wallace- Wells, Lisi "built his theory as an outsider might, relying on a grab bag of component parts: a hand- built mathematical structure, an unconventional way of describing gravity, and a mysterious mathematical entity known as E8."1 In the end Lisi’s "theory of everything" fell short of expectations, but it nonetheless yielded a whole terrain of new questions and methods. Similarly the computer scientists who pioneered new programs to produce computer- generated imagery (CGI), as many accounts of the rise of Pixar have chronicled, were academic rejects or dropouts who created independent institutes in order to explore their dreams of animated worlds.2 These alternative cultural and academic realms, the areas beside academia rather than within it, the intellectual worlds conjured by losers, failures, dropouts, and refuseniks, often serve as the launching pad for alternatives precisely when the university cannot. This is not a bad time to experiment with disciplinary transformation on behalf of the project of generating new forms of knowing, since the fields that were assembled over one hundred years ago to respond to new market economies and the demand for narrow expertise, as Foucault described them, are now losing relevance and failing to respond either to real- world knowledge projects or student interests. As the big disciplines begin to crumble like banks that have invested in bad securities we might ask more broadly, Do we really want to shore up the ragged boundaries of our shared interests and intellectual commitments, or might we rather take this opportunity to rethink the project of learning and thinking altogether? Just as the standardized tests that the U.S. favors as a guide to intellectual advancement in high schools tend to identify people who are good at standardized exams (as opposed to, say, intellectual visionaries), so in universities grades, exams, and knowledge of canons identify scholars with an aptitude for maintaining and &nbsp;This book, a stroll out of the confines of conventional knowledge and into the unregulated territories of failure, loss, and unbecoming, must make a long detour around disciplines and ordinary ways of thinking. Let me explain how universities (and by implication high schools) squash rather than promote quirky and original thought. Disciplinarity, as defined by Foucault (1995), is a technique of modern power: it depends upon and deploys normalization, routines, convention, tradition, and &nbsp;regularity, and it produces experts and administrative forms of governance. The university structure that houses the disciplines and jealously guards their boundaries now stands at a crossroads, not of disciplinarity and interdisciplinarity, past and future, national and transnational; the crossroads at which the rapidly disintegrating bandwagon of disciplines, subfields, and interdisciplines has arrived offer a choice between the university as corporation and investment opportunity and the university as a new kind of public sphere with a different investment in knowledge, in ideas, and in thought and politics.</p></div></div></td><td>3/30/14</td></tr><tr><td style="width:100%; word-break:break-all; word-break:break-word;"><div><p><input onclick="saveEntry(91)" src="../../xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" tppabs="http://opencaselist13.paperlessdebate.com/xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" style="float:right;" title="Save" type="image" value="Save"></input>

They are lawful because the United States is currently engaged in an armed conflict with those terrorist entities and because the United States has an inherent right to defend itself against imminent threats to its security. Moreover, the available evidence indicates that U.S. military and intelligence forces conduct targeted strikes in a manner consistent with international law. Military and intelligence officials go to great lengths to identify al-Qaeda operatives that pose an imminent threat and continually reassess the level of that threat. Decisions on each potential target are debated among U.S. officials before the target is placed in the “disposition matrix.” In conducting targeted strikes U.S. forces strive to minimize civilian casualties, although such casualties cannot always be prevented. The United States will continue to face asymmetric threats from non-state actors operating from the territory of nations that are either unwilling or unable to suppress the threats. To confront these threats, the United States must retain its most effective operational capabilities, including targeted strikes by armed drones, even if U.S. forces degrade al-Qaeda and its associated forces to such an extent that the United States no longer considers itself to be in a non-international armed conflict. Moreover, the United States must continue to affirm its inherent right to self-defense to eliminate threats to its national security, regardless of the presence or absence of an armed conflict recognized by international law. To that end, the United States should: Continue to affirm existing use-of-force authorities. During the past three years, senior officials of the Obama Administration have publicly set out in significant detail U.S. policies and practices regarding drone strikes. The Administration should continue to do so, emphasizing that U.S. policies adhere to widely recognized international law. Critics of the United States will continue to claim that a lack of transparency surrounds U.S. policy and actions. Such critics will likely never be satisfied, not even with full disclosure of the relevant classified legal memoranda, and their criticism will not cease until the United States abandons its practice of targeting terrorist threats in Pakistan, Yemen, and elsewhere. However, consistent repetition of the U.S. legal position on targeted drone strikes may blunt such criticism. Not derogate from the AUMF. At the 2012 NATO summit in Chicago, NATO agreed that the vast majority of U.S. and other NATO forces would be withdrawn from Afghanistan by the end of 2014, a time frame that President Obama confirmed during this year’s State of the Union address. Some critics of U.S. drone policy will inevitably argue that due to the drawdown the United States may no longer credibly claim that it remains in a state of armed conflict with the Taliban, al-Qaeda, and its associated forces, whether they are located in Afghanistan, the FATA, or elsewhere. Congress should pass no legislation that could be interpreted as a derogation from the AUMF or an erosion of the inherent right of the United States to defend itself against imminent threats posed by transnational terrorist organizations. Not create a drone court. The concept of a drone court is fraught with danger and may be an unconstitutional interference with the executive branch’s authority to wage war. U.S. armed forces have been lawfully targeting enemy combatants in armed conflicts for more than 200 years without being second-guessed by Congress or a secret “national security court.” Targeting decisions, including those made in connection with drone strikes, are carefully deliberated by military officers and intelligence officials based on facts and evidence gathered from a variety of human, signals, and imagery intelligence sources. During an armed conflict, all al-Qaeda operatives are subject to targeting; therefore, a drone court scrutinizing targeting decisions would serve no legitimate purpose. Rather than creating a special tribunal that is ill equipped to pass judgment on proportionality and military necessity, and that will never fully assuage the concerns of the critics of drone strikes, Congress should continue to leave decisions pertaining to the disposition of al-Qaeda terrorists—including U.S. citizens—with military and intelligence officials.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>Accountability problems still exist with drone courts<br/>Mulrine, CS monitor Staff writer, 13 <br/>(Anna, “Would a US 'drone court' to authorize drone strikes be a good idea?”, May 24, 2013, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/DC-Decoder/2013/0524/Would-a-US-drone-court-to-authorize-drone-strikes-be-a-good-idea-video  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/DC-Decoder/2013/0524/Would-a-US-drone-court-to-authorize-drone-strikes-be-a-good-idea-video%27" tppabs="http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/DC-Decoder/2013/0524/Would-a-US-drone-court-to-authorize-drone-strikes-be-a-good-idea-video"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/DC-Decoder/2013/0524/Would-a-US-drone-court-to-authorize-drone-strikes-be-a-good-idea-video</span></a></span>,8/6/13, vc)</p><p>Critics of the drone program, however, are generally not reassured by the notion of oversight from a special drone court. They note that the FISA courts, on which the drone courts would be modeled, operate largely in secret, doing little to improve accountability to the public. What’s more, they say, national and international laws are already in place governing when drone strikes are legal. Those laws, they add, offer greater transparency than would a secret court. “I’m not big on this,” Sarah Holewinski, executive director of the Center for Civilians in Conflict, says of the drone courts. “The fact is, we have international laws. We have domestic laws. I would focus on those and say, ‘Look, here’s the due diligence you need to do in targeting a combatant. Here’s what you need to do in order to avoid civilians. Here’s what proportionality looks like.’ ” Zeke Johnson, director of Amnesty International’s Security and Human Rights Campaign, argues that drone courts would do little to change critics' fundamental concerns about drone strikes. “What’s needed on drones is not a ‘kill court,’ but a rejection of the radical redefinition of ‘imminence’ used to expand who can be killed – as well as independent investigations of alleged extrajudicial executions and remedy for victims,” he says.</p><p>Drone Courts fail- no precedent <br/>Katya, professor of national security law at Georgetown, 13<br/>(Neal k., former acting solicitor general, “Who Will Mind the Drones?”, February 20, 2013, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/21/opinion/an-executive-branch-drone-court.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/21/opinion/an-executive-branch-drone-court.html%27" tppabs="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/21/opinion/an-executive-branch-drone-court.html"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/21/opinion/an-executive-branch-drone-court.html</span></a></span>, accessed 8/6/13,vc)&nbsp;</p><p>But the drone court idea is a mistake. It is hard to think of something less suitable for a federal judge to rule on than the fast-moving and protean nature of targeting decisions. Fortunately, a better solution exists: a “national security court” housed within the executive branch itself. Experts, not generalists, would rule; pressing concerns about classified information would be minimized; and speedy decisions would be easier to reach. There is, of course, a role for federal courts in national security. In 2006, I argued and won Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, a Supreme Court case that struck down President George W. Bush’s use of military tribunals at Guantánamo Bay. But military trials are a far cry from wartime targeting decisions. And the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which reviews administration requests to collect intelligence involving foreign agents inside the country and which some have advocated as a model for the drone court, is likewise appropriately housed within the judicial system — it rules on surveillance operations that raise questions much like those in Fourth Amendment “search and seizure” cases, a subject federal judges know well. But there is no true precedent for interposing courts into military decisions about who, what and when to strike militarily. Putting aside the serious constitutional implications of such a proposal, courts are simply not institutionally equipped to play such a role. There are many reasons a drone court composed of generalist federal judges will not work. They lack national security expertise, they are not accustomed to ruling on lightning-fast timetables, they are used to being in absolute control, their primary work is on domestic matters and they usually rule on matters after the fact, not beforehand.
