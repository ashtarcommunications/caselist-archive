Thach<br/>“we do not sweat and summon our best in order to rescue<br/>the killers”<br/>there are days, in fact,<br/>that i’ll be damned if i rescue any killer<br/>or someone even approaching such a terrible status<br/>to work in solidarity with those who are like me<br/>unlike me<br/>or resemble me<br/>does not demand or require that i save those who would identify others dead or<br/>annihilated<br/>either through neglect<br/>indifference<br/>calculation<br/>or theoethical musings<br/>i will not rescue the killers<br/>for being women all the time<br/>is like breathing in and out<br/>it is like the moments of smiles and whispers<br/>it is like warmth and passion<br/>it is like naming a voice through the song you sing<br/>it is like the roll of a dice weighed to come up doubles<br/>but to reach for your winnings<br/>and find nothing there<br/>being women all the time<br/>is like breathing in and out<br/>it is like finding yourself in the midst of degradation<br/>and having the will to stake a claim for liberation<br/>it is like turning and turning and turning into a shimmering tomorrow<br/>it is like noticing a still, small voice<br/>that you craft into a roaring wind<br/>as you recognize and feel wholeness as no longer an abstract, independent<br/>category<br/>but what we all yearn for<br/>so black women can, if we must, begin with the wounds<br/>the folds of those old wounds, that in some cases destroyed us<br/>with lies, secrets, and silences we are told about other women<br/>that are told about ourselves<br/>these wounds mark us, but they do not need to define us<br/>for as wise women<br/>or women seeking wisdom<br/>we must grasp a hermenuetic of suspicion<br/>that is, we must examine our first works over<br/>again and again<br/>and consider how we are with each other<br/>and let our religious homes and the academy care of themselves for<br/>awhile<br/>and ponder<br/>what it means for each of us<br/>to be in this work of ornery hope<br/>this work of performing Topsy<br/>knowing Topsy<br/>being Topsy<br/>growing Topsy<br/>yes all of us gathered here in our global clearing are subject to the ravages of<br/>structural racism, sexism, heterosexism, classism, speciesism, agism, ableism<br/>but what interests me is that african american women have and do join<br/>others<br/>in holding these “isms”<br/>these masters’ and mistresses’ tools<br/>in our control<br/>and we have used them<br/>sometimes relentlessly<br/>we have used them<br/>to avoid our depression and discontent<br/>by cheering ourselves and finding a woman who is worse off<br/>than we are<br/>to avoid the questions we have about our beauty<br/>by failing to question who sets the standards<br/>and then dressing<br/>literally<br/>to kill<br/>we have used these deadly tools to protect ourselves against charges that we<br/>aren’t feminine<br/>by pointing to someone who may<br/>or may not<br/>be tougher than we are<br/>to prove that we really do know the color pink<br/>to cloak our fears that we may not be bright enough or talented enough<br/>by ridiculing other women and making them into postmodern<br/>pickaninnies<br/>by charging that they are sublimating their frustrations<br/>in their work<br/>in religious communities<br/>in the goal of a more whole black community<br/>within black communities across the landscape<br/>to do this—amongst ourselves, at times<br/>means we bring fractured selves into all manner of relationships and that<br/>we often abide sexism and heterosexism<br/>rather than question their existence in the household of God<br/>hear me now, we tolerate single issue politicians and pastors and academicians<br/>who spew poison into african american life<br/>and we think its milk and honey for soul salvation and we lap it<br/>up—greedily<br/>as we fail to recognize the death pangs that sear us<br/>with each dribbling drop down our throats<br/>we turn away from injustice and run for the sanctuary of the alleged holy<br/>and fail to see the graves dug before us<br/>until we find ourselves<br/>our communities<br/>falling in<br/>as the dirt of judgment is mournfully<br/>if not gleefully<br/>tossed over us<br/>as it commemorates the remarkable assault all of us can<br/>launch against ourselves<br/>and then have the audacity and the naivety to name it<br/>righteousness<br/>and black women are not the only ones in God’s creation who do this<br/>we have all manner and manifestations of this emanating from the vast<br/>cultural communities that mark our commonalities<br/>the rolling eyes and kinky hair of the pickaninny is no longer<br/>confined to black children—they mark each and everyone one of us<br/>in the american social order and beyond<br/>i will not rescue the killers<br/>of dreams of a world better than this<br/>of hopes that continue to pulse, however faintly, in the midst<br/>of disaster and ruin<br/>i will not rescue the killers<br/>who create optional reading lists<br/>that signal to me<br/>that some actual or alleged scholars really believe<br/>that there are optional bodies, cultures, lives, ideas,<br/>hopes, realities<br/>and secondary lists are little better<br/>when they traffic yearnings and expectations as<br/>ideologies and abstractions<br/>i will not rescue the killer<br/>who remains silent when the innocent are murdered<br/>and it is called patriotism or cleansing or white male rage<br/>or horizontal violence<br/>when there is starvation on our streets<br/>while there is more than enough food for everyone to eat<br/>three squares a day and at least one snack<br/>when children die unloved and unwanted and thrown away<br/>and we shake our collective pious heads and shut the<br/>doors of homes and our hearts<br/>when money determines right and wrong<br/>good and evil<br/>unity and dissent<br/>diversity and blandness<br/>hope and despair<br/>promise and lies<br/>damnation and salvation<br/>no, absolutely no, i will not rescue the killers<br/>when the academy devolves into gigantic public holding pens<br/>for creativity and intellect<br/>in other words<br/>for me and my house<br/>growing Topsy while standing with others across differences<br/>does not require that I <br/>sacrifice my very soul<br/>so that others may find comfort and ease in the macabre<br/>spectacle of my self annihilation<br/>or the obliteration of whole communities<br/>Topsy as a womanist does not find it acceptable that I acquiesce to a least<br/>common denominator justice<br/>that is really no justice at all<br/>she does not require that I check my passions<br/>my insights<br/>my communities<br/>at the door to enter the hall of kumbaya<br/>and if there is any wisdom that can come<br/>from this black woman<br/>on notions of solidarities and differences that are strong<br/>enough, wise enough, and strong enough to go<br/>toe-to-toe<br/>with the fantastic hegemonic imagination<br/>it is that<br/>to engage in such work is absolutely dangerous<br/>it may, in fact, not be good for one’s health at all<br/>it can lead to heart and soul-ache<br/>it can make us old before our time<br/>it can make us eat and drink too much or too little<br/>of all the unhealthy things<br/>it can turn us bitter and sarcastic<br/>it can make you ornery and mean<br/>it can turn justice into vengeance<br/>it can turn us into killers<br/>but the danger does not stop here<br/>it is dangerous because it means that we refuse the emotional<br/>numbing panaceas<br/>of acquisition and status and competitive spirit that does<br/>not seek excellence,

through<br/>that all of us are going through in some measure<br/>with all the comings and leavings that are part of life and death<br/>but i also think about them in relation to what they may have to say in<br/>reminding me why i do what i do<br/>and how<br/>and in what ways<br/>for me, to talk about standing with one another<br/>to conjure solidarity across differences<br/>to spark womanist

back in time<br/>to that 60s cocktail party in which Ralph Ellison<br/>the author of Invisible Man spoke in “clipped, deliberate syllables” to his peers<br/>“Show me the poem, tell me the names of the opera/the<br/>symphony that will stop one man from killing another<br/>man and then maybe” he gestured toward the elegant<br/>bejeweled assembly with his hand that held a cut-crystal<br/>glass of scotch—“just maybe some of this can be justified.”<br/>i am relieved to say that tempting the agony of the absurd<br/>does not leave me in Ellison’s condemnatory despair<br/>but it does leave me with a frustrated hope<br/>a hope that is imbued with Jordan’s words<br/>as they echo<br/>“we do not sweat and summon our best in order to rescue<br/>the killers”<br/>there are days, in fact,<br/>that i’ll be damned if i rescue any killer<br/>or someone even approaching such a grotesque status<br/>to work in solidarity with those who are like me<br/>unlike me<br/>or resemble me<br/>does not demand or require that i save those who would see others dead or<br/>annihilated<br/>either through neglect<br/>indifference<br/>calculation<br/>or theoethical musings<br/>i will not rescue the killers<br/>of dreams and visions of a world better than this<br/>of hopes that continue to pulse, however faintly, in the midst<br/>of disaster and ruin<br/>i will not rescue the killers<br/>who create optional reading lists<br/>that signal to me<br/>that some actual or alleged scholars really believe<br/>that there are optional peoples, cultures, lives, ideas,<br/>hopes, realities<br/>and secondary lists are little better<br/>when they traffic peoples’ yearnings and expectations as<br/>ideologies and abstractions<br/>i will not rescue the killer<br/>who remains silent when the innocent are murdered<br/>and it is called patriotism or cleansing or white male rage<br/>or horizontal violence<br/>when people starve on our streets<br/>while there is more than enough food for everyone to eat<br/>three squares a day and at least one snack<br/>when children die unloved and unwanted and thrown away<br/>and we shake our collective pious heads and shut the<br/>doors of homes and our

alone<br/>they may help, to be sure<br/>but tackling structural evil takes a whole bunch of folks<br/>with varieties of skills and insights<br/>because structures of domination rarely come in such pristine<br/>forms as<br/>circles<br/>triangles<br/>rectangles<br/>or rhomboids<br/>no, structures of domination are like demonic ink blots<br/>they have cores<br/>but the splatter marks are far and wide and absolutely<br/>dangerous<br/>and they can cause so much collateral damage<br/>that they disfigure and maim<br/>to speak of solidarity<br/>to conjure standing anywhere together<br/>is, then, to tempt the agony of the absurd<br/>but frankly, i simply don’t know what else to do<br/>and remain faithful<br/>and although Jordan’s description of tinkering, daydreaming, revising, and<br/>memorizing<br/>does not sit well for this womanist ethicist<br/>i do believe in strategizing, envisioning, challenging, debunking, and<br/>transforming<br/>but always with an eye to sharing and receiving the dignity<br/>and gift of humanity and creation<br/>this means that a solidarity seeking the status quo is not one i can embrace a<br/>solidarity that teaches a studied silence that rewards blind, thought-less, clueless<br/>obedience<br/>and punishes vital curiosity<br/>is not one that i can come near<br/>a solidarity that only tolerates oppositional knowledge on playgrounds,<br/>streets, homes, popular culture, youth groups<br/>but never in board meetings, religious councils, strategy sessions<br/>or in policy development or pulpits or curriculum revisions<br/>is not a solidarity that is actually concerned about justice<br/>and it does not deserve my time<br/>but it does need to be watched, monitored, like a hawk<br/>and if need be, be destroyed<br/>whatever wisdom i have on solidarity and differences<br/>has been crafted from the hard experiences<br/>of learning over and over again<br/>that just because folk espouse solidarity does not mean<br/>they either know it or mean it<br/>that there are many good works being done to bring in<br/>justice<br/>but that there is only one of me<br/>and that i must, as each of us must<br/>make some choices about who we stand in solidarity with<br/>and how we will or will not deal with the differences<br/>that can enrich us<br/>challenge us<br/>deny us<br/>destroy us<br/>but to remember also that we must not take so long to choose<br/>that the choice gets made by our indecision or inaction<br/>we may choose wisely or foolishly<br/>but the point is that we develop the ability to recognize where<br/>our actions are leading us<br/>and where we have actually gone<br/>and reformulate and assess on a continual basis<br/>if we are truly working for justice or if we have fallen into<br/>cooptation<br/>or complicity<br/>or betrayal<br/>there are always options<br/>i’ve learned this from the trickster tradition in my culture<br/>but they cut both ways and sometimes even slice and dice<br/>to move beyond the tight circle that we often seem caught in that is hollowed<br/>out by conservatism and liberalism<br/>means that we stop collapsing difference and diversity and<br/>plurality<br/>and all those terms we use to signal humanity and creation<br/>is large<br/>into such neat and pristine buzz words<br/>and instead realize that<br/>we will not always agree<br/>there will be times of reasoned (and unreasoned) dissent<br/>that we may not be able to work<br/>together on everything or every issue<br/>sometimes it is to recast<br/>from our worldviews<br/>the things we’ve learned through the years<br/>but even as small children:<br/>the police are not always your friend<br/>it is not always wise to wait to cross at<br/>a corner<br/>or even to cross only at corners<br/>in other words, there are few absolutes in life<br/>and solidarities and differences are just as caught up in this<br/>reality as episodes or steady diets of disaster and ruin<br/>no, as i continue being a part of growing Topsy, i do not sweat and summon<br/>whatever best there is in me to rescue the killers<br/>but i do try to give all of who i am to the work for justice<br/>and hang in there with others who recognize that solidarities<br/>and differences are messy<br/>and ultimatly human<br/>and in some small way this marks our humanity<br/>and turns the absurdities<br/>into living, breathing, active hope</p><p>The United States Congress should immediately require that all persons captured by the United States in AUMF affiliated groups be afforded due

Each group huddles closer and lowers the volumes of their whisper as the child approaches. Her presence is not ignored, but also not encouraged. She is allowed into their circle but not invited there. She can stay, but she cannot speak. She runs to other children. Their circle is the same way. She runs to another group. She is still not good enough. Her skin is too black, then too white. Her hair is too short and too curly. She is a girl. She is not welcome in any of their circles. She runs to the teacher for protection and finds only more of the same. Hurt. Rejection. Anger. Confusion. But most of all, she feels exclusion. She experiences an exclusion that no other child on that playground understands and she experiences exclusion that the teacher cannot protect her from and she experiences exclusion that will follow her for all of her life.&nbsp;</p><p>Aiight so yo, let’s talk for a minute. This game we play, this is something else. I remember when I first started debate. I remember talkin’ bout the government and I remember coming up with silly things for them to do that they would never hear and never actually do. I remember seein’ other teams doin’ other things, and I remember wanting to do that. I remember bein’ told that was cheating, I should just focus on the good ol’ USFG. Ha. I remember trying to do it anyway. I remember when I walked into a round and someone said that I was “Liberty’s Wilderson team.” Hahaha, playa, I ain’t neva read Wilderson in a debate round in mah life. Nice try though, everybody always thinkin all us black girls are the same. I remember a round we had when the judge decided to vote for the other team because he liked debate. Cool story bro. I like debate too, but it don’t like me. We gotsta introduce some culture to this place or we are never going to be able to change anything. The debate community uses the resolution to detain my identity- it holds it within a prison-like state by forcing me to believe that I cannot participate in this game without abandoning myself when I walk into a round. The state detains my identity by forcing me into the margin- by allowing systems of oppression to arrest me and hold me captive until they see fit to let me go.

it comes to solidarity<br/>which i assume is another way to say justice<br/>i am not interested in them<br/>except for how to decrease their numbers<br/>and their power<br/>i have no wish to be objective about their behavior, methods, ideologies, or<br/>strategies<br/>when i do the work of justice<br/>it is with and as an advocate for the victims<br/>actual<br/>possible<br/>imagined<br/>of evil<br/>it is subjective, it is emotional, it is passionate, it is very interested<br/>and if i cannot find others who are interested and committed to this<br/>then there is no solidarity<br/>and our differences not only separate us<br/>they make us adversaries<br/>or enemies<br/>in other words, for me, i do not assume solidarity<br/>when i join others in the work of justice<br/>solidarity is something that is nurtured and grown<br/>in the yearning for and living out of justice<br/>solidarity comes from hard work<br/>listening<br/>analyzing<br/>questioning<br/>rethinking<br/>accepting<br/>rejecting<br/>it comes from a place of respecting and being respected<br/>and that, i think, does not come easily or naturally for most of us<br/>if it were so natural, then we wouldn’t be in the fix we are trying to get out of<br/>for to respect others<br/>means we must also respect ourselves<br/>and centuries of inherited messages about the inherent evil of humanity (with<br/>a large measure of this brutalizing swill aimed at women)<br/>pose a wall of judgment and condemnation<br/>that is hard for many of us to scale<br/>so as we seek to work together, we must always be working on ourselves<br/>and perhaps this is where the comforting begins<br/>as each of us has that dawning and then awakening in us<br/>that the point is in some religious version of perfection<br/>but that we live our humanity with passion and vigor—<br/>regardless<br/>that we live our lives in justice and hope and even love—<br/>relentlessly<br/>that we recognize that none of us has the corner on righteousness<br/>that we are the ones we have been waiting for<br/>and ultimately, there is no one to do this work for us<br/>this, then, is the first light of empowerment<br/>when we realize that we cannot do the work of justice<br/>to end structural injustice<br/>by individual acts of valor and conviction alone<br/>they may help, to be sure<br/>but tackling structural evil takes a whole bunch of folks<br/>with varieties of skills and insights<br/>because structures of domination rarely come in such pristine<br/>forms as<br/>circles<br/>triangles<br/>rectangles<br/>or rhomboids<br/>no, structures of domination are like demonic ink blots<br/>they have cores<br/>but the splatter marks are far and wide and absolutely<br/>dangerous<br/>and they can cause so much collateral damage<br/>that they disfigure and maim<br/>to speak of solidarity<br/>to conjure standing anywhere together<br/>is, then, to tempt the agony of the absurd<br/>but frankly, i simply don’t know what else to do<br/>and remain faithful<br/>and although Jordan’s description of tinkering, daydreaming, revising, and<br/>memorizing<br/>does not sit well for this womanist ethicist<br/>i do believe in strategizing, envisioning, challenging, debunking, and<br/>transforming<br/>but always with an eye to sharing and receiving the dignity<br/>and gift of humanity and creation<br/>this means that a solidarity seeking the status quo is not one i can embrace a<br/>solidarity that teaches a studied silence that rewards thought-less, clueless<br/>obedience<br/>and punishes vital curiosity<br/>is not one that i can come near<br/>a solidarity that only tolerates oppositional knowledge on playgrounds,<br/>streets, homes, popular culture, youth groups<br/>but never in board meetings, religious councils, strategy sessions<br/>or in policy development or pulpits or curriculum revisions<br/>is not a solidarity that is actually concerned about justice<br/>and it does not deserve my time<br/>but it does need to be watched, monitored, like a hawk<br/>and if need be, be destroyed<br/>whatever wisdom i have on solidarity and differences<br/>has been crafted from the hard experiences<br/>of learning over and over again<br/>that just because folk espouse solidarity does not mean<br/>they either know it or mean it<br/>that there are many good works being done to bring in<br/>justice<br/>but that there is only one of me<br/>and that i must, as each of us must<br/>make some choices about who we stand in solidarity with<br/>and how we will or will not deal with the differences<br/>that can enrich us<br/>challenge us<br/>deny us<br/>destroy us<br/>but to remember also that we must not take so long to choose<br/>that the choice gets made by our indecision or inaction<br/>we may choose wisely or foolishly<br/>but the point is that we develop the ability to recognize where<br/>our actions are leading us<br/>and where we have actually gone<br/>and reformulate and assess on a continual basis<br/>if we are truly working for justice or if we have fallen into<br/>cooptation<br/>or complicity<br/>or betrayal<br/>there are always options<br/>i’ve learned this from the trickster tradition in my culture<br/>but they cut both ways and sometimes even slice and dice<br/>to move beyond the tight circle that we often seem caught in that is hollowed<br/>out by conservatism and liberalism<br/>means that we stop collapsing difference and diversity and<br/>plurality<br/>and all those terms we use to signal humanity and creation<br/>is large<br/>into such neat and pristine buzz words<br/>and instead realize that<br/>we will not always agree<br/>there will be times of reasoned (and unreasoned) dissent<br/>that we may not be able to work<br/>together on everything or every issue<br/>sometimes it is to recast<br/>from our worldviews<br/>the things we’ve learned through the years<br/>but even as small children:<br/>the police are not always your friend<br/>it is not always wise to wait to cross at<br/>a corner<br/>or even to cross only at corners<br/>in other words, there are few absolutes in life<br/>and solidarities and differences are just as caught up in this<br/>reality as episodes or steady diets of disaster and ruin<br/>no, as i continue being a part of growing Topsy, i do not sweat and summon<br/>whatever best there is in me to rescue the killers<br/>but i do try to give all of who i am to the work for justice<br/>and hang in there with others who recognize that solidarities<br/>and differences are messy<br/>and ultimatly human<br/>and in some small way this marks our humanity<br/>and turns the absurdities<br/>into living, breathing, active hope</p></div></div></td><td>2/22/14</td></tr><tr><td style="width:100%; word-break:break-all; word-break:break-word;"><div><p><input

it comes to solidarity<br/>which i assume is another way to say justice<br/>i am not interested in them<br/>except for how to decrease their numbers<br/>and their power<br/>i have no wish to be objective about their behavior, methods, ideologies, or<br/>strategies<br/>when i do the work of justice<br/>it is with and as an advocate for the victims<br/>actual<br/>possible<br/>imagined<br/>of evil<br/>it is subjective, it is emotional, it is passionate, it is very interested<br/>and if i cannot find others who are interested and committed to this<br/>then there is no solidarity<br/>and our differences not only separate us<br/>they make us adversaries<br/>or enemies<br/>in other words, for me, i do not assume solidarity<br/>when i join others in the work of justice<br/>solidarity is something that is nurtured and grown<br/>in the yearning for and living out of justice<br/>solidarity comes from hard work<br/>listening<br/>analyzing<br/>questioning<br/>rethinking<br/>accepting<br/>rejecting<br/>it comes from a place of respecting and being respected<br/>and that, i think, does not come easily or naturally for most of us<br/>if it were so natural, then we wouldn’t be in the fix we are trying to get out of<br/>for to respect others<br/>means we must also respect ourselves<br/>and centuries of inherited messages about the inherent evil of humanity (with<br/>a large measure of this brutalizing swill aimed at women)<br/>pose a wall of judgment and condemnation<br/>that is hard for many of us to scale<br/>so as we seek to work together, we must always be working on ourselves<br/>and perhaps this is where the comforting begins<br/>as each of us has that dawning and then awakening in us<br/>that the point is in some religious version of perfection<br/>but that we live our humanity with passion and vigor—<br/>regardless<br/>that we live our lives in justice and hope and even love—<br/>relentlessly<br/>that we recognize that none of us has the corner on righteousness<br/>that we are the ones we have been waiting for<br/>and ultimately, there is no one to do this work for us<br/>this, then, is the first light of empowerment<br/>when we realize that we cannot do the work of justice<br/>to end structural injustice<br/>by individual acts of valor and conviction alone<br/>they may help, to be sure<br/>but tackling structural evil takes a whole bunch of folks<br/>with varieties of skills and insights<br/>because structures of domination rarely come in such pristine<br/>forms as<br/>circles<br/>triangles<br/>rectangles<br/>or rhomboids<br/>no, structures of domination are like demonic ink blots<br/>they have cores<br/>but the splatter marks are far and wide and absolutely<br/>dangerous<br/>and they can cause so much collateral damage<br/>that they disfigure and maim<br/>to speak of solidarity<br/>to conjure standing anywhere together<br/>is, then, to tempt the agony of the absurd<br/>but frankly, i simply don’t know what else to do<br/>and remain faithful<br/>and although Jordan’s description of tinkering, daydreaming, revising, and<br/>memorizing<br/>does not sit well for this womanist ethicist<br/>i do believe in strategizing, envisioning, challenging, debunking, and<br/>transforming<br/>but always with an eye to sharing and receiving the dignity<br/>and gift of humanity and creation<br/>this means that a solidarity seeking the status quo is not one i can embrace a<br/>solidarity that teaches a studied silence that rewards thought-less, clueless<br/>obedience<br/>and punishes vital curiosity<br/>is not one that i can come near<br/>a solidarity that only tolerates oppositional knowledge on playgrounds,<br/>streets, homes, popular culture, youth groups<br/>but never in board meetings, religious councils, strategy sessions<br/>or in policy development or pulpits or curriculum revisions<br/>is not a solidarity that is actually concerned about justice<br/>and it does not deserve my time<br/>but it does need to be watched, monitored, like a hawk<br/>and if need be, be destroyed<br/>whatever wisdom i have on solidarity and differences<br/>has been crafted from the hard experiences<br/>of learning over and over again<br/>that just because folk espouse solidarity does not mean<br/>they either know it or mean it<br/>that there are many good works being done to bring in<br/>justice<br/>but that there is only one of me<br/>and that i must, as each of us must<br/>make some choices about who we stand in solidarity with<br/>and how we will or will not deal with the differences<br/>that can enrich us<br/>challenge us<br/>deny us<br/>destroy us<br/>but to remember also that we must not take so long to choose<br/>that the choice gets made by our indecision or inaction<br/>we may choose wisely or foolishly<br/>but the point is that we develop the ability to recognize where<br/>our actions are leading us<br/>and where we have actually gone<br/>and reformulate and assess on a continual basis<br/>if we are truly working for justice or if we have fallen into<br/>cooptation<br/>or complicity<br/>or betrayal<br/>there are always options<br/>i’ve learned this from the trickster tradition in my culture<br/>but they cut both ways and sometimes even slice and dice<br/>to move beyond the tight circle that we often seem caught in that is hollowed<br/>out by conservatism and liberalism<br/>means that we stop collapsing difference and diversity and<br/>plurality<br/>and all those terms we use to signal humanity and creation<br/>is large<br/>into such neat and pristine buzz words<br/>and instead realize that<br/>we will not always agree<br/>there will be times of reasoned (and unreasoned) dissent<br/>that we may not be able to work<br/>together on everything or every issue<br/>sometimes it is to recast<br/>from our worldviews<br/>the things we’ve learned through the years<br/>but even as small children:<br/>the police are not always your friend<br/>it is not always wise to wait to cross at<br/>a corner<br/>or even to cross only at corners<br/>in other words, there are few absolutes in life<br/>and solidarities and differences are just as caught up in this<br/>reality as episodes or steady diets of disaster and ruin<br/>no, as i continue being a part of growing Topsy, i do not sweat and summon<br/>whatever best there is in me to rescue the killers<br/>but i do try to give all of who i am to the work for justice<br/>and hang in there with others who recognize that solidarities<br/>and differences are messy<br/>and ultimatly human<br/>and in some small way this marks our humanity<br/>and turns the absurdities<br/>into living, breathing, active hope</p></div></div></td><td>2/22/14</td></tr><tr><td style="width:100%; word-break:break-all; word-break:break-word;"><div><p><input

would identify others dead or<br/>annihilated<br/>either through neglect<br/>indifference<br/>calculation<br/>or theoethical musings<br/>i will not rescue the killers<br/>for being women all the time<br/>is like breathing in and out<br/>it is like the moments of smiles and whispers<br/>it is like warmth and passion<br/>it is like naming a voice through the song you sing<br/>it is like the roll of a dice weighed to come up doubles<br/>but to reach for your winnings<br/>and find nothing there<br/>being women all the time<br/>is like breathing in and out<br/>it is like finding yourself in the midst of degradation<br/>and having the will to stake a claim for liberation<br/>it is like turning and turning and turning into a shimmering tomorrow<br/>it is like noticing a still, small voice<br/>that you craft into a roaring wind<br/>as you recognize and feel wholeness as no longer an abstract, independent<br/>category<br/>but what we all yearn for<br/>so black women can, if we must, begin with the wounds<br/>the folds of those old wounds, that in some cases destroyed us<br/>with lies, secrets, and silences we are told about other women<br/>that are told about ourselves<br/>these wounds mark us, but they do not need to define us<br/>for as wise women<br/>or women seeking wisdom<br/>we must grasp a hermenuetic of suspicion<br/>that is, we must examine our first works over<br/>again and again<br/>and consider how we are with each other<br/>and let our religious homes and the academy care of themselves for<br/>awhile<br/>and ponder<br/>what it means for each of us<br/>to be in this work of ornery hope<br/>this work of performing Topsy<br/>knowing Topsy<br/>being Topsy<br/>growing Topsy<br/>yes all of us gathered here in our global clearing are subject to the ravages of<br/>structural racism, sexism, heterosexism, classism, agism, ableism<br/>but what interests me is that african american women have and do join<br/>others<br/>in holding these “isms”<br/>these masters’ and mistresses’ tools<br/>in our control<br/>and we have used them<br/>sometimes relentlessly<br/>we have used them<br/>to avoid our depression and discontent<br/>by cheering ourselves and finding a woman who is worse off<br/>than we are<br/>to avoid the questions we have about our beauty<br/>by failing to question who sets the standards<br/>and then dressing<br/>literally<br/>to kill<br/>we have used these deadly tools to protect ourselves against charges that we<br/>aren’t feminine<br/>by pointing to someone who may<br/>or may not<br/>be tougher than we are<br/>to prove that we really do know the color pink<br/>to cloak our fears that we may not be bright enough or talented enough<br/>by ridiculing other women and making them into postmodern<br/>pickaninnies<br/>by charging that they are sublimating their frustrations<br/>in their work<br/>in religious communities<br/>in the goal of a more whole black community<br/>within black communities across the landscape<br/>to do this—amongst ourselves, at times<br/>means we bring fractured selves into all manner of relationships and that<br/>we often abide sexism and heterosexism<br/>rather than question their existence in the household of God<br/>hear me now, we tolerate single issue politicians and pastors and academicians<br/>who spew venom into african american life<br/>and we think its milk and honey for soul salvation and we lap it<br/>up—greedily<br/>as we fail to recognize the death pangs that sear us<br/>with each dribbling drop down our throats<br/>we turn away from injustice and run for the sanctuary of the alleged holy<br/>and fail to see the graves dug before us<br/>until we find ourselves<br/>our communities<br/>falling in<br/>as the dirt of judgment is mournfully<br/>if not gleefully<br/>tossed over us<br/>as it commemorates the remarkable assault all of us can<br/>launch against ourselves<br/>and then have the audacity and the naivety to name it<br/>righteousness<br/>and black women are not the only ones in God’s creation who do this<br/>we have all manner and manifestations of this emanating from the vast<br/>cultural communities that mark our commonalities<br/>the rolling eyes and kinky hair of the pickaninny is no longer<br/>confined to black children—they mark each and everyone one of us<br/>in the american social order and beyond<br/>i will not rescue the killers<br/>of dreams of a world better than this<br/>of hopes that continue to pulse, however faintly, in the midst<br/>of disaster and ruin<br/>i will not rescue the killers<br/>who create optional reading lists<br/>that signal to me<br/>that some actual or alleged scholars really believe<br/>that there are optional peoples, cultures, lives, ideas,<br/>hopes, realities<br/>and secondary lists are little better<br/>when they traffic peoples’ yearnings and expectations as<br/>ideologies and abstractions<br/>i will not rescue the killer<br/>who remains silent when the innocent are murdered<br/>and it is called patriotism or cleansing or white male rage<br/>or horizontal violence<br/>when people starve on our streets<br/>while there is more than enough food for everyone to eat<br/>three squares a day and at least one snack<br/>when children die unloved and unwanted and thrown away<br/>and we shake our collective pious heads and shut the<br/>doors of homes and our hearts<br/>when money determines right and wrong<br/>good and evil<br/>unity and dissent<br/>diversity and blandness<br/>hope and despair<br/>promise and lies<br/>damnation and salvation<br/>no, absolutely no, i will not rescue the killers<br/>to engage in such work is absolutely dangerous<br/>it may, in fact, not be good for one’s health at all<br/>it can lead to heart and soul-ache<br/>it can make us old before our time<br/>it can make us eat and drink too much or too little<br/>of all the unhealthy things<br/>it can turn us bitter and sarcastic<br/>it can make you ornery and mean as a snake<br/>it can turn justice into vengeance<br/>it can turn us into killers<br/>but the danger does not stop here<br/>it is dangerous because it means that we refuse the emotional<br/>numbing panaceas<br/>of acquisition and status and competitive spirit that does<br/>not seek excellence, only winning<br/>we pierce through the straw figure of a free market<br/>and speak with increasing precision and accuracy about<br/>the impact of transnationals<br/>from agribusiness<br/>to munitions<br/>to clothing manufacturers<br/>to western tastes and cultures passing themselves<br/>off as neutral or the markers of progress<br/>we become dangerous when<br/>we speak the truth that the king is naked<br/>when it comes to the U.S. prison industrial complex<br/>when we question declarations of war that are soon<br/>accompanied by massive bail outs for corporations that<br/>even that bastion of progressive monetary policies, the<br/>wall street journal, said “mainly padded corporate bottom<br/>lines”<br/>when we express confusion and dismay when terrorism is<br/>used as the reason for a sharp cut in the capital gains tax<br/>a tax in which 80 percent of the benefits would<br/>go to the wealthiest 2 percent of the taxpayers<br/>yes, this is a naked butt king<br/>when it comes to public policy that is really the personal<br/>agenda of moralizing rhetoricians<br/>who are dangerous because they now hold elected office<br/>and someone believed that they should bring us back to<br/>the good old days<br/>that were, for many of us, deadly days<br/>when almost every piece of legislation we are told is good for us<br/>is sold to us with one price tag (like medicare drug benefits<br/>for the elderly)<br/>and then we are told—as many predicted on the left and<br/>the right that the costs would be more and strain the federal<br/>budget more<br/>but we are told—just trust us, we know we are<br/>right<br/>and then we find that a $400 billion price tag<br/>over 10 years is now, weeks after the dust had<br/>settled from the debate, is really a $530 billion<br/>price tag<br/>when we go to war based on claims about weapons of<br/>mass destruction in Iraq based on “documentary evidence”<br/>that was forged and doubted by CIA analysts from the<br/>beginning<br/>and each time any of us express doubt about this “evidence,”<br/>we were branded as weak or unpatriotic<br/>and now, months and deaths later, we detect federal<br/>officials recasting their words as if they never knew that<br/>the “evidence” could possibly be cooked<br/>and that the president was not told the truth<br/>and we should be glad we invaded Iraq anyway<br/>because Saddam Hussein had to be removed<br/>from power<br/>and it should not matter, ultimately, that we were lied to<br/>although most of us are taught that when you lie,<br/>you should be exposed and punished<br/>but the fact that these lies went largely<br/>unreported by

Each group huddles closer and lowers the volumes of their whisper as the child approaches. Her presence is not ignored, but also not encouraged. She is allowed into their circle but not invited there. She can stay, but she cannot speak. She runs to other children. Their circle is the same way. She runs to another group. She is still not good enough. Her skin is too black, then too white. Her hair is too short and too curly. She is a girl. She is not welcome in any of their circles. She runs to the teacher for protection and finds only more of the same. Hurt. Rejection. Anger. Confusion. But most of all, she feels exclusion. She experiences an exclusion that no other child on that playground understands and she experiences exclusion that the teacher cannot protect her from and she experiences exclusion that will follow her for all of her life.&nbsp;</p><p>I remember when I expressed interest in K arguments as a novice. “You can’t do that, it’s cheating.” Oh, sorry, I didn’t realize that the state was the only option. That caused me to think about my place in the community but didn’t push me to actually interrogate it. I remember the round that I first realized that exclusion exists in this community. I walked into a round and the opponents took one look at me and said “oh, you’re Liberty’s Wilderson team” and scrambled to change their frontlines. No, sorry, there’s more than one black girl on our team, but thanks for that assumption. That encounter forced me to think about the way that I was perceived in the community but did not fully change my approach. I remember stopping and thinking about the way that people saw me, remembering that my skin is both too dark and too light. I remember the round that Vida and I lost because “debate is good so you should’ve read framework.” I’m sorry, but I don’t want to force anyone else to advocate for state action because I can’t even do that myself. I’m done saying “sorry” and I’m done pretending to have agency over institutions that exclude me. I am a marked body because when I walk into a round I am perceived in a certain way that ignores any subjectivity I have claimed. The debate community uses the resolution to detain my identity- it holds it within a prison-like state by forcing me to believe that I cannot participate in this game without abandoning myself when I walk into a round. The state detains my identity by forcing me into the margin- by allowing systems of oppression to arrest me and hold me captive until they see fit to let me go.

See, I started this activity as a novice and everyone always told me that we were supposed to debate about governmental policies and I didn’t see anything wrong with that. I thought that I could do that without being excluded. Ha, I even thought that as a mixed woman, I would be fighting exclusion because the few black women that I had seen all did “K debate” or “performance debate” and I decided that I was going to be the one that did it- the one that didn’t have to resort to what I was taught was “cheating.” &nbsp;Debate was good.<br/>That all changed when I explicitly experienced the structural oppressions in place that worked beneath the surface; that disguised themselves until that point. Vida and I lost a round not because our arguments weren’t articulated well, which they very well might not have been, but because we are black women. I realized that there was nothing I could have said in my 2NR that would have won the negative ballot- not because we messed up in the block and not because the 1AR was the best speech in the history of the debate- but because as black women we were placed at a fatal disadvantage.<br/>These structural oppressions don’t make explicit appearances often because they thrive off of existing under the surface- that’s what makes the status quo so exclusionary- every marked body experiences this pushing to the side in a different way.<br/>The debate community uses the resolution to detain my identity- it holds it within a prison-like state by forcing me to believe that I cannot participate in this game without abandoning myself when I walk into a round. The state detains my identity by forcing me into the margin- by allowing systems of oppression to arrest me and hold me captive until they see fit to let me go. I am indefinitely detained.</p><p>Knowledge is produced on a subjective level and used to create objective truths- understanding the intersectional nature of oppression is necessary in order to understand how reality allows for a constant alienation of both knowledge and bodies<br/>Collins, 2k<br/>(Patricia Hill, “Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness, and the Politics of Empowerment,” pages 12-13, accessed ebsco 2-13-12, mee)<br/> <br/>Historically, while they often … on alternative Black feminist worldviews.&nbsp;</p><p>Exclusion has a radical effect on oppressed bodies- divergence from standard academic theory allows us to create a condition of possibility for a new methodology that celebrates liberation through experience<br/>Collins, 2k<br/>(Patricia Hill, “Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness, and the Politics of Empowerment,” pages 9-10, accessed ebsco 2-13-12, mee)</p><p>As an historically … designed to resist racial oppression.&nbsp;</p><p>Excluding these key perspectives leads to a reentrenchment of the overarching systems of oppression- white supremacist capitalist patriarchy is a system of global oppression that exists by continually shifting to disenfranchise marked bodies- a personal approach is necessary to disrupting the system<br/>Rabaka, Associate Professor of Africana Studies in the Department of Ethnic Studies at the University of Colorado at Boulder, 7 (Reiland, Affiliate Professor of Women and Gender Studies and a Research Fellow at the Center for Studies of Ethnicity and Race in America (CSERA), August 4, “The Souls of White Folk: W.E.B.

My gender is secondary to the initial thought of my phenotype. There is nothing I can do to change that nor would I want to because my identity is my own but that level of subjectivity does not matter in the status quo.

Each group huddles closer and lowers the volumes of their whisper as the child approaches. Her presence is not ignored, but also not encouraged. She is allowed into their circle but not invited there. She can stay, but she cannot speak. She runs to other children. Their circle is the same way. She runs to another group. She is still not good enough. Her skin is too black, then too white. Her hair is too short and too curly. She is a girl. She is not welcome in any of their circles. She runs to the teacher for protection and finds only more of the same. Hurt. Rejection. Anger. Confusion. But most of all, she feels exclusion. She experiences an exclusion that no other child on that playground understands and she experiences exclusion that the teacher cannot protect her from and she experiences exclusion that will follow her for all of her life.&nbsp;</p><p>Aiight so yo, let’s talk for a minute. This game we play, this is something else. I remember when I first started debate. I remember talkin’ bout the government and I remember coming up with silly things for them to do that they would never hear and never actually do. I remember seein’ other teams doin’ other things, and I remember wanting to do that. I remember bein’ told that was cheating, I should just focus on the good ol’ USFG. Ha. I remember trying to do it anyway. I remember when I walked into a round and someone said that I was “Liberty’s Wilderson team.” Hahaha, playa, I ain’t neva read Wilderson in a debate round in mah life. Nice try though, everybody always thinkin all us black girls are the same. I remember a round we had when the judge decided to vote for the other team because he liked debate. Cool story bro. I like debate too, but it don’t like me. We gotsta introduce some culture to this place or we are never going to be able to change anything. The debate community uses the resolution to detain my identity- it holds it within a prison-like state by forcing me to believe that I cannot participate in this game without abandoning myself when I walk into a round.

going through<br/>that all of us are going through in some measure<br/>with all the comings and leavings that are part of life and death<br/>but i also think about them in relation to what they may have to say in<br/>reminding me why i do what i do<br/>and how<br/>and in what ways<br/>for me, to talk about standing with one another<br/>to conjure solidarity across differences<br/>to spark womanist wisdom on solidarity and differences<br/>is, at first glance<br/>(and i must admit on several glances looks mullings later)<br/>to tempt the agony of the absurd<br/>i feel as though i have been cast back in time<br/>to that 60s cocktail party in which Ralph Ellison<br/>the author of Invisible Man spoke in “clipped, deliberate syllables” to his peers<br/>“Show me the poem, tell me the names of the opera/the<br/>symphony that will stop one man from killing another<br/>man and then maybe” he gestured toward the elegant<br/>bejeweled assembly with his hand that held a cut-crystal<br/>glass of scotch—“just maybe some of this can be justified.”<br/>i am relieved to say that tempting the agony of the absurd<br/>does not leave me in Ellison’s condemnatory despair<br/>but it does leave me with a frustrated hope<br/>a hope that is imbued with Jordan’s words<br/>as they echo<br/>“we do not sweat and summon our best in order to rescue<br/>the killers”<br/>there are days, in fact,<br/>that i’ll be damned if i rescue any killer<br/>or someone even approaching such a grotesque status<br/>to work in solidarity with those who are like

believe<br/>that there are optional peoples, cultures, lives, ideas,<br/>hopes, realities<br/>and secondary lists are little better<br/>when they traffic peoples’ yearnings and expectations as<br/>ideologies and abstractions<br/>i will not rescue the killer<br/>who remains silent when the innocent are murdered<br/>and it is called patriotism or cleansing or white male rage<br/>or horizontal violence<br/>when people starve on our streets<br/>while there is more than enough food for everyone to eat<br/>three squares a day and at least one snack<br/>when children die unloved and unwanted and thrown away<br/>and we shake our collective pious heads and shut the<br/>doors of homes and our hearts<br/>when money determines right and wrong<br/>good and evil<br/>unity and

should bring us back to<br/>the good old days<br/>that were, for many of us, deadly days<br/>when almost every piece of legislation we are told is good for us<br/>is sold to us with one price tag (like medicare drug benefits<br/>for the elderly)<br/>and then we are told—as many predicted on the left and<br/>the right that the costs would be more and strain the federal<br/>budget more<br/>but we are told—just trust us, we know we are<br/>right<br/>and then we find that a $400 billion price tag<br/>over 10 years is now, weeks after the dust had<br/>settled from the debate, is really a $530

the<br/>beginning<br/>and each time any of us express doubt about this “evidence,”<br/>we were branded as weak or unpatriotic<br/>and now, months and deaths later, we detect federal<br/>officials recasting their words as if they never knew that<br/>the “evidence” could possibly be cooked<br/>and that the president was not told the truth<br/>and we should be glad we invaded Iraq

administration<br/>is like the dead skunk in the middle of<br/>the road<br/>stinking to high heaven<br/>but we drive around it as if it<br/>were not there<br/>no i am not here for the killers<br/>when it comes to solidarity<br/>which i assume is another way to say justice<br/>i am not interested in them<br/>except for how to decrease their numbers<br/>and their power<br/>i have no wish to be objective about their behavior, methods, ideologies, or<br/>strategies<br/>when i do the work of justice<br/>it is with and as an advocate for the victims<br/>actual<br/>possible<br/>imagined<br/>of evil<br/>it is subjective, it is emotional, it is passionate, it is very interested<br/>and if i cannot find others who are interested and committed to this<br/>then there is no solidarity<br/>and our differences not only separate us<br/>they make us adversaries<br/>or enemies<br/>in other words, for me, i do not assume solidarity<br/>when i join others in the work of justice<br/>solidarity is something that is nurtured and grown<br/>in the yearning for and living out of justice<br/>solidarity comes from hard work<br/>listening<br/>analyzing<br/>questioning<br/>rethinking<br/>accepting<br/>rejecting<br/>it comes from a place of respecting and being respected<br/>and that, i think, does not come easily or naturally for most of us<br/>if it were so natural, then we wouldn’t be in the fix we are trying to get out of<br/>for to respect others<br/>means we must also respect ourselves<br/>and centuries of inherited messages about the inherent evil of humanity (with<br/>a large measure of this brutalizing swill aimed at women)<br/>pose a wall of judgment and condemnation<br/>that is hard for many of us to scale<br/>so as we seek to work together, we must always be working on ourselves<br/>and perhaps this is where the comforting begins<br/>as each of us has that dawning and then awakening in us<br/>that the point is in some religious version of perfection<br/>but that we live our humanity with passion and vigor—<br/>regardless<br/>that we live our lives in justice and hope and even love—<br/>relentlessly<br/>that we recognize that none of us has the corner on righteousness<br/>that we are the ones we have been waiting for<br/>and ultimately, there is no one to do this work for us<br/>this, then, is the first light of empowerment<br/>when we realize that we cannot do the work of justice<br/>to end structural injustice<br/>by individual acts of valor and conviction alone<br/>they may help, to be sure<br/>but tackling structural evil takes a whole bunch of folks<br/>with varieties of skills and insights<br/>because structures of domination rarely come in such pristine<br/>forms as<br/>circles<br/>triangles<br/>rectangles<br/>or rhomboids<br/>no, structures of domination are like demonic ink blots<br/>they have cores<br/>but the splatter marks are far and wide and absolutely<br/>dangerous<br/>and they can cause so much collateral damage<br/>that they disfigure and maim<br/>to speak of solidarity<br/>to conjure standing anywhere together<br/>is, then, to tempt the agony of the absurd<br/>but frankly, i simply don’t know what else to do<br/>and remain faithful<br/>and although Jordan’s description of tinkering, daydreaming, revising, and<br/>memorizing<br/>does not sit well for this womanist ethicist<br/>i do believe in strategizing, envisioning, challenging, debunking, and<br/>transforming<br/>but always with an eye to sharing and receiving the dignity<br/>and gift of humanity and creation<br/>this means that a solidarity seeking the status quo is not one i can embrace a<br/>solidarity that teaches a studied silence that rewards thought-less, clueless<br/>obedience<br/>and punishes vital curiosity<br/>is not one that i can come near<br/>a solidarity that only tolerates oppositional knowledge on playgrounds,<br/>streets, homes, popular culture, youth groups<br/>but never in board meetings, religious councils, strategy sessions<br/>or in policy development or pulpits or curriculum revisions<br/>is not a solidarity that is actually concerned about justice<br/>and it does not deserve my time<br/>but it does need to be watched, monitored, like a hawk<br/>and if need be, be destroyed<br/>whatever wisdom i have on solidarity and differences<br/>has been crafted from the hard experiences<br/>of learning over and over again<br/>that just because folk espouse solidarity does not mean<br/>they either know it or mean it<br/>that there are many good works being done to bring in<br/>justice<br/>but that there is only one of me<br/>and that i must, as each of us must<br/>make some choices about who we stand in solidarity with<br/>and how we will or will not deal with the differences<br/>that can enrich us<br/>challenge us<br/>deny us<br/>destroy us<br/>but to remember also that we must not take so long to choose<br/>that the choice gets made by our indecision or inaction<br/>we may choose wisely or foolishly<br/>but the point is that we develop the ability to recognize where<br/>our actions are leading us<br/>and where we have actually gone<br/>and reformulate and assess on a continual basis<br/>if we are truly working for justice or if we have fallen into<br/>cooptation<br/>or complicity<br/>or betrayal<br/>there are always options<br/>i’ve learned this from the trickster tradition in my culture<br/>but they cut both ways and sometimes even slice and dice<br/>to move beyond the tight circle that we often seem caught in that is hollowed<br/>out by conservatism and liberalism<br/>means that we stop collapsing difference and diversity and<br/>plurality<br/>and all those terms we use to signal humanity and creation<br/>is large<br/>into such neat and pristine buzz words<br/>and instead realize that<br/>we will not always agree<br/>there will be times of reasoned (and unreasoned) dissent<br/>that we may not be able to work<br/>together on everything or every issue<br/>sometimes it is to recast<br/>from our worldviews<br/>the things we’ve learned through the years<br/>but even as small children:<br/>the police are not always your friend<br/>it is not always wise to wait to cross at<br/>a corner<br/>or even to cross only at corners<br/>in other words, there are few absolutes in life<br/>and solidarities and differences are just as caught up in this<br/>reality as episodes or steady diets of disaster and ruin<br/>no, as i continue being a part of growing Topsy, i do not sweat and summon<br/>whatever best there is in me to rescue the killers<br/>but i do try to give all of who i am to the work for justice<br/>and hang in there with others who recognize that solidarities<br/>and differences are messy<br/>and ultimatly human<br/>and in some small way this marks our humanity<br/>and turns the absurdities<br/>into living, breathing, active hope</p></div></div></td><td>2/8/14</td></tr><tr><td style="width:100%; word-break:break-all; word-break:break-word;"><div><p><input
