Through its prerogative to¶ authorize programs and appropriate funds, it can define and limit presidential power. In domestic as well as in foreign affairs, Congress can withhold all or part of an appropriation and may attach riders to appropriations measures to proscribe certain actions.44¶ Some claim that the power of the purse is ineffective in restraining presidential wars. Senator Jacob Javits (R-N.Y.) said that Congress "can hardly cut off appropriations when 500,000 American troops are fighting for their lives, as in Vietnam."45 The short answer is that Congress can, and has, used the power of the purse to restrict presidential war power. If members of Congress are worried about American troops fighting for their lives in a futile war, those lives are not protected by voting for continued funding. The proper and responsible action is to terminate appropriations and bring the troops home. Members need to make that case to their constituents. It can be done.¶ The Supreme Court has held that the President as Commander in Chief "is authorized to direct the movements of the naval and military forces placed by law at his command, and to employ them in the manner he may deem most effectual to harass and conquer and subdue the enemy."46 The power to move forces "placed by law" at his command implies that Congress can, by statute, control the scope of the commander-in-chief powers. Many such restrictions have been enacted. Following are some contemporary examples.¶ In 1973, Congress used the power of the purse to end the war in Vietnam. Three years later it prohibited the CIA from operating in Angola other than to gather intelligence. Legislation also prohibited the Agency from conducting military or paramilitary operations in Angola and denied any appropriated funds to finance directly or indirectly any type of military assistance to Angola.47¶ In 1984, Congress adopted the Boland Amendment to prohibit assistance of any kind by the Reagan administration to support the Contras in Nicaragua. The all-embracing language read: "During fiscal year 1985, no funds available to the Central Intelligence Agency, the Department of¶ Defense, or any other agency or entity of the United States involved in intelligence activities may be obligated or expended for the purpose or which would have the effect of supporting, directly or indirectly, military or paramilitary operations in Nicaragua by any nation, group, organization, movement, or individual." 48 No constitutional objection to this provision was ever voiced publicly by President Reagan, the White House, the Justice Department, or any other agency of the executive branch.¶ Two years later, Congress restricted the President’s military role in Central America by stipulating that U.S. personnel "may not provide any training or other service, or otherwise participate directly or indirectly in the provision of any assistance, to the Nicaraguan democratic resistance pursuant to this title within those land areas of Honduras and Costa Rica which are within 20 miles of the border with Nicaragua."9 The statute defined U.S. personnel to mean "any member of the United States Armed Forces who is on active duty or is performing inactive duty training" and any employee of any department, agency, or other component of the executive branch.50 The clear purpose was to prevent military activities in Honduras and Costa Rica from spilling over into Nicaragua. The Reagan administration never offered any constitutional objections to this statutory restriction.¶ Also in 1986, Congress passed this prohibition on placing U.S. personnel in Nicaragua: "No member of the United States Armed Forces or employee of any department, agency, or other component of the United States Government may enter Nicaragua to provide military advice, training, or logistical support to paramilitary groups operating inside that country. Nothing in this title shall be construed as authorizing any member or unit of the Armed Forces of the United States to engage in combat against the government of Nicaragua."51¶ In 1991, when Congress authorized President Bush to use military force against Iraq, the authority was explicitly linked to UN Security Council Resolution 678, which was adopted to expel Iraq from Kuwait.52 Thus, the legislation did not authorize any wider action, such as using U.S. forces to invade and occupy Iraq. In 1993, Congress established a deadline for troops to leave Somalia. No funds could be used for military action after March 31, 1994, unless the President requested an extension from Congress and received legislative authority</p><h4 id="HFuturepresidentsrollback" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Future presidents roll back</span></h4><p><strong>Harvard Law Review 12</strong>, "Developments in the Law: Presidential Authority," Vol. 125:2057, www.harvardlawreview.org/media/pdf/vol125_devo.pdf<br/>The recent history of signing statements demonstrates how public opinion can effectively check presidential expansions <br/>AND<br/>practices. 147 Only time, and perhaps public opinion, will tell.</p></div></div></td><td>10/5/13</td></tr><tr><td style="width:100%; word-break:break-all; word-break:break-word;"><div><p><input onclick="saveEntry(3)" src="../../xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" tppabs="http://opencaselist13.paperlessdebate.com/xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" style="float:right;" title="Save" type="image" value="Save"></input>
