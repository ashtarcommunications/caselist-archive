That is the position taken by many scholars, <br/>AND<br/>accomplish. It is more accurate to say that OLC enables than constrains.<br/>A. Background on OLC ¶ OLC is a small office in the Justice Department <br/>AND<br/>General has ¶ delegated to it much of his advice-giving role. <br/>Most matters that come before OLC are routine. OLC provides legal analysis of bills<br/>AND<br/>White ¶ House may put pressure on OLC to rubber stamp the action. <br/>B. OLC as a Constraint on the Executive ¶ A number of scholars have argued that OLC can serve as an important constraint on ¶ executive power. I will argue that OLC cannot act as a constraint on executive power. Indeed, its ¶ only function is the opposite—as an “enabler” (as I will put it) or extender of executive power. <br/>A president must choose a course of action. He goes to OLC for advice<br/>AND<br/>, and the president will gratefully accept it although not necessarily follow it. <br/>If the story ended here, then it would be hard to see what the <br/>AND<br/>constraints ¶ on executive power that are imposed from outside the executive branch. <br/>However, there is an important twist that complicates the analysis. The president may <br/>AND<br/>, and they have in this way given OLC quasi-judicial status. <br/>But if the president publicizes OLC opinions, he takes a risk. The risk <br/>AND<br/>. At a minimum, OLC raises the political cost of the action. <br/>I have simplified greatly, but I believe that this basic logic has led some scholars to ¶ believe that OLC serves as a constraint on the president. But this is a mistake. OLC strengthens ¶ the president’s hand in some cases and weakens them in others; but overall it extends his ¶ power—it serves as enabler, not constraint. <br/>To see why, consider an example in which a president must choose an action <br/>AND<br/>political opposition to L ¶ will be greater than it would be otherwise.</p></div></div></td><td>3/14/14</td></tr><tr><td style="width:100%; word-break:break-all; word-break:break-word;"><div><p><input onclick="saveEntry(49)" src="../../xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" tppabs="http://opencaselist13.paperlessdebate.com/xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" style="float:right;" title="Save" type="image" value="Save"></input>

Procedural Requirements¶ Currently, officials in the executive branch carry out all <br/>AND<br/>is no equivalent¶ effort in areas outside the active conflict zone.164<br/>Meanwhile, the degree of ex post review of detention decisions depends¶ on the location of detention as opposed to the location of capture. Thus, Guantanamo detainees are entitled to habeas review, but detainees held in¶ Afghanistan are not, even if they were captured far away and brought to¶ Afghanistan to be detained.165<br/>Enhanced ex ante and ex post procedural protections for both detention¶ and targeting, coupled with transparency as to the standards and processes¶ employed, serve several important functions: they can minimize error and¶ abuse by creating time for advance reflection, correct erroneous deprivations¶ of liberty, create endogenous incentives to avoid mistake or abuse, and¶ increase the legitimacy of state action.<br/>a. Ex Ante Procedures¶ Three key considerations should guide the development of ex <br/>AND<br/>must be transparent¶ and sufficiently credible to achieve the desired legitimacy gains.<br/>These considerations suggest the value of an independent, formalized,¶ ex ante review system. Possible models include the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC),168 or a FISC-like entity composed of military¶ and intelligence officials and military lawyers, in the mode of an executive¶ branch review board.169</p></div></div></td><td>2/9/14</td></tr><tr><td style="width:100%; word-break:break-all; word-break:break-word;"><div><p><input onclick="saveEntry(22)" src="../../xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" tppabs="http://opencaselist13.paperlessdebate.com/xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" style="float:right;" title="Save" type="image" value="Save"></input>

Why else would we read¶ Foucault?<br/>We seek to conceive what is wrong in the world, to grasp it in <br/>AND<br/>for offering it a new face, or at least a new expression.<br/>There is struggle in this, struggle against ideas and ways of thinking¶ that present themselves to us as inescapable. We know this struggle from¶ Foucault’s writings. It is not clear that he ever wrote about anything¶ else. But this is not the struggle I want to address here.<br/>For there is, on the other hand, another search and another goal. <br/>AND<br/>.¶ In short, we would like our thought to celebrate our lives.<br/>To change the world and to celebrate life. This, as the theologian¶ Harvey Cox saw, is the struggle within us.1¶ It is a struggle in which one¶ cannot choose sides; or better, a struggle in which one must choose both¶ sides. The abandonment of one for the sake of the other can lead only¶ to disaster or callousness.<br/>Forsaking the celebration of life for the sake of changing the world¶ is the <br/>AND<br/>attends to it should be evident¶ to all of us by now.<br/>The alternative is surely not to shift one’s allegiance to the pure¶ celebration of <br/>AND<br/>by an equally expansive disregard¶ for those we place in harm’s way.<br/>This is the struggle, then. The one between the desire for lifecelebration and <br/>AND<br/>question then becomes one of how to choose both¶ sides at once.</p><p>Ressentiment is wrong – no basis for it – it is an outdated generalization.<br/>Foot, University of California Los Angeles philosophy professor, 2001<br/>Philippa, in Nietzsche by John Richardson and Brian Leiter, “Nietzche: the Revaluation of Values” <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.amazon.com/Nietzsche-Oxford-Readings-Philosophy-Richardson/dp/0198752709  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.amazon.com/Nietzsche-Oxford-Readings-Philosophy-Richardson/dp/0198752709%27" tppabs="http://www.amazon.com/Nietzsche-Oxford-Readings-Philosophy-Richardson/dp/0198752709"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.amazon.com/Nietzsche-Oxford-Readings-Philosophy-Richardson/dp/0198752709</span></a></span>, p.219-20, accessed 3-19-14, TAP</p><p>The conclusion of this discussion must be that Nietzsche’s “revaluation of values” is <br/>AND<br/>and could see inhumanity on its present scale and inits present blatant forms.</p><p>People should be allowed the CHOICE of deciding for themselves how to determine their own approach to life.

That is the position taken by many scholars, <br/>AND<br/>accomplish. It is more accurate to say that OLC enables than constrains.<br/>A. Background on OLC ¶ OLC is a small office in the Justice Department <br/>AND<br/>General has ¶ delegated to it much of his advice-giving role. <br/>Most matters that come before OLC are routine. OLC provides legal analysis of bills<br/>AND<br/>White ¶ House may put pressure on OLC to rubber stamp the action. <br/>B. OLC as a Constraint on the Executive ¶ A number of scholars have argued that OLC can serve as an important constraint on ¶ executive power. I will argue that OLC cannot act as a constraint on executive power. Indeed, its ¶ only function is the opposite—as an “enabler” (as I will put it) or extender of executive power. <br/>A president must choose a course of action. He goes to OLC for advice<br/>AND<br/>, and the president will gratefully accept it although not necessarily follow it. <br/>If the story ended here, then it would be hard to see what the <br/>AND<br/>constraints ¶ on executive power that are imposed from outside the executive branch. <br/>However, there is an important twist that complicates the analysis. The president may <br/>AND<br/>, and they have in this way given OLC quasi-judicial status. <br/>But if the president publicizes OLC opinions, he takes a risk. The risk <br/>AND<br/>. At a minimum, OLC raises the political cost of the action. <br/>I have simplified greatly, but I believe that this basic logic has led some scholars to ¶ believe that OLC serves as a constraint on the president. But this is a mistake.
