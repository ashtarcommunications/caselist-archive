National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor said the White House also would not comment. The CIA’s plans were first reported by the Wall Street Journal Monday night.<br/>The new tasking for the agency marks a major escalation of the clandestine American war in Yemen, as well as a substantial expansion of the CIA’s drone war.<br/>The agency pioneered the use of armed drones in Afghanistan a decade ago and has carried out hundreds of strikes in Pakistan in recent years. As a result, officials said, the CIA has developed substantial expertise in using a combination of drone surveillance and the cultivation of human source networks on the ground to carry out strikes inside a country where the U.S. military has limited ability to operate.<br/>The addition of CIA drones also addresses a growing concern inside the Joint Special Operations Command that the military-run drone campaign in Yemen was not getting adequate resources, given the seriousness of the threat posed by al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, as the Yemen-based offshoot of the terrorist group is known.<br/>3.

Scott Shane notes correctly other nations such as China are building their own drones and in the future U.S. forces could be attacked by them–our forces will not have a monopoly on their use forever. Fair enough, but he goes further, suggesting our current use of drones to target terrorists will backfire: <br/>If China, for instance, sends killer drones into Kazakhstan to hunt minority Uighur Muslims it accuses of plotting terrorism, what will the United States say? What if India uses remotely controlled craft to hit terrorism suspects in Kashmir, or Russia sends drones after militants in the Caucasus? American officials who protest will likely find their own example thrown back at them. <br/>“The problem is that we’re creating an international norm” — asserting the right to strike preemptively against those we suspect of planning attacks, argues Dennis M. Gormley, a senior research fellow at the University of Pittsburgh and author of Missile Contagion, who has called for tougher export controls on American drone technology. “The copycatting is what I worry about most.” <br/>This is a familiar trope of liberal critics who are always claiming we should forego <br/>AND<br/>and cut down our own arsenal–to encourage similar restraint from Iran. <br/>The argument falls apart rather quickly because it is founded on a false premise: <br/>AND<br/>is unilateral disarmament–which is what the New York Times implicitly suggests. <br/>Imagine if we did refrain from drone strikes against al-Qaeda–what would be the consequence? If we were to stop the strikes, would China really decide to take a softer line on Uighurs or Russia on Chechen separatists? That seems unlikely given the viciousness those states already employ&nbsp;</p><p>in their battles against ethnic separatists–which at least in Russia’s case already includes the suspected assassination of Chechen leaders abroad. What’s the difference between sending a hit team and sending a drone? <br/>While a decision on our part to stop drone strikes would be unlikely to alter <br/>AND<br/>the vain hope it will encourage disarmament on the part of dictatorial states.<br/>4.

The Iraqis and the Saudis did send small contingents to fight the Israelis in 1948 and 1967, but they were either ineffective or never made it. In the 1970s and 1980s, Arab countries other than Syria, which had a compelling interest in establishing its hegemony over Lebanon, never committed forces either to protect the Lebanese from the Israelis or from other Lebanese. The civil war in Lebanon was regarded as someone else’s fight.<br/>Indeed, this is the way many leaders view the current situation in Iraq. To Cairo, Amman and Riyadh, the situation in Iraq is worrisome, but in the end it is an Iraqi and American fight. As far as Iranian mullahs are concerned, they have long preferred to press their interests through proxies as opposed to direct engagement. At a time when Tehran has access and influence over powerful Shiite militias, a massive cross-border incursion is both unlikely and unnecessary.<br/>So Iraqis will remain locked in a sectarian and ethnic struggle that outside powers may abet, but will remain within the borders of Iraq.<br/>The Middle East is a region both prone and accustomed to civil wars.

Bill Keller of the New York Times has described Pakistani president Asif Ail Zardari as overseeing ‘a ruinous kleptocracy that is spiraling deeper into economic crisis’. But in contrast to predictions of an unravelling nation, British journalist-scholar Anatol Lieven argues that the Pakistani state is likely to continue muddling through its many problems, unable to resolve them but equally predisposed against civil war and consequent state collapse. Lieven finds that the strong bonds of family, clan, tribe and the nature of South Asian Islam prevent modernist movements — propounded by the government or by the radicals — from taking control of the entire country. ¶ Lieven’s analysis is more persuasive than the widespread view that Pakistan is about to fail as a state. The formal institutions of the Pakistani state are surprisingly robust given the structural conditions in which they operate. Indian political leaders recognise Pakistan’s resilience. Given the bad choices in Pakistan, they would rather not have anything to do with it. If there is going to be a civil war, why not wait for the two sides to exhaust themselves before thinking about intervening? The 1971 war demonstrated India’s willingness to exploit conditions inside Pakistan, but to break from tradition requires strong, countervailing logic, and those elements do not yet exist. Given the current conditions and those in the foreseeable future, India is likely to sit out a Pakistani civil war while covertly coordinating policy with the United States.</p><p>4.

CONCLUSION<br/>Ignored by political scientists, congressional end-runs undoubtedly constrain the decisionmaking of the <br/>AND<br/>either of the two congressional constraints addressed in the prevailing judicial politics literature.<br/>Within the field of judicial politics there remains a lingering uncertainty about Congress's practical impact on the Supreme Court's exercise of judicial review. This uncertainty has been compounded by the literature's failure to study the constraining role of congressional end-runs. Going forward, judicial politics scholars should incorporate the end-run into their formal SOP models and related empirical studies. Such incorporation promises to give political scientists a fuller sense of how their strategic Justices interact with Congress in our constitutional democracy. pg. 273</p><p>Lower courts will not follow. &nbsp;They will deviate if the ruling threatens their legitimacy &nbsp;<br/>Westerland et al., Professor of Political Science @ University of Arizona, 10<br/>(Chad Westerland, Jeffrey A.

Criticisms of the WPR<br/>To promulgate a workable solution to the WPR, it is first necessary to discuss the present criticisms¶ of the statute. Several salient criticisms emerge from the resounding sea of disapprovals the¶ WPR has accumulated throughout its long and oft-attacked history. As discussed earlier, the first¶ and most transparent criticism of the WPR stems from widespread (virtually unanimous) and longstanding¶ presidential refusal to comply with both the WPR’s text and spirit.72 The logical corollary is¶ that the WPR has failed to prevent the President from unilaterally deploying armed forces abroad.73¶ Instead of fostering an environment conducive to collaboration between the political branches when¶ deciding to introduce forces into hostilities, the WPR has instead allowed the Executive to fashion¶ creative arguments to exploit the poor statutory drafting of the WPR and to evade the WPR’s central¶ purpose. While these criticisms demonstrate an overall failure of the WPR to achieve its articulated¶ goal, several other flaws in the WPR remain.74<br/>Another unforeseen consequence of the WPR’s statutory language, fatal to its proper operation,¶ <br/>AND<br/>hostilities are afoot—renders the self-activating nature of resolution inapposite.</p><p>Topical Education—by manipulating the topic to access their own political agenda they skirt debate about the implementation of policies by the government. &nbsp;Their education is distrusting of institutional research and pragmatic reform. &nbsp;Even if their intentions are good, their message results in fascist totalitarianism.<br/>Lewis, George Washington University assistant professor, 92 <br/>Martin, assistant prof. at George Washington U, “Green Delusions”, p. 247-8</p><p>A majority of those born between 1960 and 1980 seem to tend toward cynicism, <br/>AND<br/>constitutional refinements become inconvenient niceties.”</p></div></div></td><td>1/21/14</td></tr><tr><td style="width:100%; word-break:break-all; word-break:break-word;"><div><p><input onclick="saveEntry(36)" src="../../xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" tppabs="http://opencaselist13.paperlessdebate.com/xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" style="float:right;" title="Save" type="image" value="Save"></input>
