What the drone adds to that intelligence might be considerable, through its surveillance capabilities -- but much of the drone's contribution will be tactical, providing intelligence that assists in the planning and execution of the strike itself, in order to pick the moment when there might be the fewest civilian casualties.<br/>Nonetheless, in conjunction with high-quality intelligence, drone warfare offers an unparalleled means to strike directly at terrorist organizations without needing a conventional or counterinsurgency approach to reach terrorist groups in their safe havens. It offers an offensive capability, rather than simply defensive measures, such as homeland security alone. Drone warfare offers a raiding strategy directly against the terrorists and their leadership.<br/>If one believes, as many of the critics of drone warfare do, that <br/>AND<br/>common enemies are examples of the methods that are just of military nature.<br/>Drone warfare today is integrated with a much larger strategic counterterrorism target -- one in <br/>AND<br/>acknowledged in communications, have a significant impact on planning and organizational effectiveness.<br/>Nuclear terrorism is feasible-~--high risk of theft and attacks escalate<br/>Vladimir Z.

They are passionate in their conviction that <br/>AND<br/>" and "makes their lives into a nightmare worthy of dystopian novels". <br/>I disagree. Increasingly it appears that arguments like Friedersdorf makes are no longer sustainable (and there's real question if they ever were). Not only have drone strikes decreased, but so too have the number of civilians killed – and dramatically so. <br/>This conclusion comes not from Obama administration apologists but rather, Chris Woods, whose research has served as the empirical basis for the harshest attacks on the Obama Administration's drone policy. <br/>Woods heads the covert war program for the Bureau of Investigative Journalism (TBIJ), <br/>AND<br/>of numbers here speaks to the extraordinary challenge in tabulating civilian death rates. <br/>There is little local reporting done on the ground in northwest Pakistan, which is the epicenter of the US drone program. As a result data collection is reliant on Pakistani news reporting, which is also dependent on Pakistani intelligence, which has a vested interest in playing up the negative consequences of US drones. <br/>When I spoke with Woods last month, he said that a fairly clear pattern has emerged over the past year – far fewer civilians are dying from drones. "For those who are opposed to drone strikes," says Woods there is historical merit to the charge of significant civilian deaths, "but from a contemporary standpoint the numbers just aren't there." <br/>While Woods makes clear that one has to be "cautious" on any estimates of casualties, it's not just a numeric decline that is being seen, but rather it's a "proportionate decline". In other words, the percentage of civilians dying in drone strikes is also falling, which suggests to Woods that US drone operators are showing far greater care in trying to limit collateral damage. <br/>Woods estimates are supported by the aforementioned databases. In Pakistan, New America Foundation claims there have been no civilian deaths this year and only five last year; Long War Journal reported four deaths in 2012 and 11 so far in 2013; and TBIJ reports a range of 7-42 in 2012 and 0-4 in 2013. In addition, the drop in casualty figures is occurring not just in Pakistan but also in Yemen. <br/>These numbers are broadly consistent with what has been an under-reported decline in <br/>AND<br/>in Somalia there has been no strike reported for more than a year. <br/>Ironically, these numbers are in line with the public statements of CIA director Brennan, and even more so with Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, chairman of the Select Intelligence Committee, who claimed in February that the numbers she has received from the Obama administration suggest that the typical number of victims per year from drone attacks is in "the single digits".<br/>Part of the reason for these low counts is that the Obama administration has sought to minimize the number of civilian casualties through what can best be described as "creative bookkeeping". The administration counts all military-age males as possible combatants unless they have information (posthumously provided) that proves them innocent. Few have taken the White House's side on this issue (and for good reason) though some outside researchers concur with the administration's estimates.<br/>Christine Fair, a professor at Georgetown University has long maintained that civilian deaths from drones in Pakistan are dramatically overstated. She argues that considering the alternatives of sending in the Pakistani military or using manned aircraft to flush out jihadists, drone strikes are a far more humane method of war-fighting.<br/>Rejecting sovereignty exacerbates inequalities and prevents emancipation<br/>Tara McCormack 10, Lecturer in International Politics at the University of Leicester, PhD in IR from the University of Westminster, “Critique, Security and Power: The Political Limits to Emancipatory Approaches,” p139, google books<br/>Critics of critical and emancipatory theory have raised pertinent problems in terms both of the <br/>AND<br/>people might have a chance to have some meaningful control over their lives.<br/>The state of exception can be contained-~--no impact<br/>Jennifer Mitzen 11, PhD, University of Chicago, Associate Professor of Political Science at Ohio State University, Michael E.

As Solomon puts it:<br/>the reality to which the nuclear referent refers ... is, in Aristotelian terms, <br/>AND<br/>, a potentiality that can’t be calculated through the calculus of probability.26<br/>This is not to suggest that Solomon takes the whole Aristotelian doctrine on board, <br/>AND<br/>regularities, rational conjectures, the weighing of probable outcomes etc. For the<br/>absence of any strictly logical (i.e. deductive) order of necessity does nothing to disqualify these other forms of valid inferential reasoning.</p><p>&nbsp;Case<br/>AT: Biopolitics<br/>Agamben’s rejection of all law as inherently violent is based on misreadings of political theory and false generalizations – not all law is violent, and we shouldn’t assume that it is<br/>Jean-Philippe Deranty 4, Professor of French and German Philosophy at Macquarie University, online: <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.borderlandsejournal.adelaide.edu.au/vol3no1_2004/deranty_agambnschall.htm  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.borderlandsejournal.adelaide.edu.au/vol3no1_2004/deranty_agambnschall.htm%27" tppabs="http://www.borderlandsejournal.adelaide.edu.au/vol3no1_2004/deranty_agambnschall.htm"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.borderlandsejournal.adelaide.edu.au/vol3no1_2004/deranty_agambnschall.htm</span></a></span><br/>28.

In all these settings the tragic human suffering produced by such plunder is simply ignored.

Most intellectuals do not acknowledge that it is exactly because of plunder of gold, silver, bioresources and so on that development accelerated in the West, so that underdevelopment is a historically produced victimization of weaker and more enclosed communities and not the disease of lesser people. <br/>Prevailing short-term and short-sighted opportunism must be overcome. An analysis of the imperial adventure rendered in legal terms opens up a possibility for a radical rethinking of a model of development defined by Western ideas of progress, development and economic efficiency. A reconfiguration would mean, first and foremost, a clear rejection of an ideology of inherent superiority of Western culture that does not recognize that the West is itself part of something much larger. <br/>Off<br/>The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit should form an en banc panel to review its opinion in Al-Bihani v.

Surely <br/>AND<br/>human environment, until very recently his colleagues have almost entirely ignored him.<br/>In this section we explore some of the theories with which we may be able <br/>AND<br/>hidden motivations and phantasies, this investigation will not be able to proceed.<br/>Renee Lertzman (2008), one of the first psychoanalytically informed social scientists to engage with the ecological crisis, describes a common surreal aspect of our everyday responses to 'eco-anxiety', the experience of flipping through a newspaper and being suddenly confronted with:<br/>the stop-dead-in-your-tracks, bone-chilling kind of ecological travesties taking place around our planet today ... declining honey bees, melting glaciers, plastics in the sea, or the rate of coal plants being built in China each second. But how many of us actually do stop dead in our tracks? Have we become numb? ... if so, how can we become more awake and engaged to what is happening?<br/>Environmental campaigners have become increasingly frustrated and pessimistic. Even as their messages spread further <br/>AND<br/>with the danger (for the full report see Climate Action Network 2010).<br/>Recent opinion polls show climate scepticism is on the rise in the UK as well<br/>AND<br/>about man's contribution to climate change and becoming more so' (BBC 2010a).<br/>Most remarkable here is the discrepancy between public and expert opinion. According to the <br/>AND<br/>overall science, and yet this is not how the public perceived it.<br/>Subsequently, the UK Parliament's Commons Science and Technology Committee completed its investigation into the case (BBC 2010c). The MPs' committee concluded there was no evidence that UEA's Professor Phil Jones had manipulated data, or tried 'to subvert the peer review process' and that 'his reputation, and that of his climate research unit, remained intact' (BBC<br/>2010c). The report noted that 'it is not standard practice in climate science to <br/>AND<br/>global warming is happening and is induced by human activity' (BBC 2010c).<br/>This story was followed closely by another in January 2010 when the IPCC admitted a <br/>AND<br/>the Parliamentary committee's report as further evidence of an institutional cover-up.<br/>The important psychological point is that people are ready for such events, indeed eager <br/>AND<br/>discipline has a lot to offer. As Lertzman (2008) writes:<br/>What if the core issue is more about how humans respond to anxiety? ... Environmental problems ... conjure up anxieties that ... we are done for, and nothing can really be done ... To help me understand more, I turn to Freud ... because I have found few others who speak as eloquently, and sensitively about what humans do when faced with anxiety or anxiety-provoking news.<br/>Freud, civilization, nature and the dialectic of the Enlightenment<br/>Is Freud really relevant to understanding our current crisis? While he was very much <br/>AND<br/>, Freud did offer us some crucial reflections on our relationship with nature:<br/>The principle task of civilization, its actual raison d'etre, is to defend us against nature. We all know that in many ways civilization does this fairly well already, and clearly as time goes on it will do it much better. But no one is under the illusion that nature has already been vanquished; and few dare hope that she will ever be entirely subdued to man.<br/>(Freud 1927: 51)<br/>Here we can see an interesting ambivalence in Freud's rhetorical style, which perhaps unwittingly <br/>AND<br/>nature, rather than fighting it.' Thus, according to Rust,<br/>we find ourselves ... between stories (Berry 1999), in a transitional space ... <br/>AND<br/>our own myths as well as find inspiration from the stories of others.<br/>(ibid.)<br/>The myth of progress enters the climate change debate in calls for geo-engineering <br/>AND<br/>fear and trembling in the face of the awesome power of mother nature.<br/>There are the elements which seem to mock at all human control: the earth<br/>AND<br/>and helplessness, which we thought to escape through the work of civilization.<br/>(Freud 1927: 15-16)<br/>Here is the other side of Freud's writing on the relation between 'Nature' and 'Civilization', with humanity portrayed as a weak and helpless infant in awe and fear of a mighty and terrible mother. The lure and horror of matriarchy lie behind the defensive constructs of patriarchal civilization, just as Klein's paranoid-schizoid fears of fragmentation, engulfment, and annihilation lie behind later castration threats (Hinshelwood 1991).<br/>With each new earthquake or flood, nature erupts into culture -similar to Kristeva's <br/>AND<br/>attempt to maintain an illusory autonomy and control in the face of chaos.<br/>There is often a tension in Freud, between the celebration of Enlightenment values found <br/>AND<br/>its most trenchant defence. Psychoanalysis, as always, is exquisitely ambivalent.<br/>Ultimately, for Freud, both the natural world and our inner nature are untamable <br/>AND<br/>previously smaller and more manageable ones (Diamond 2006: 43-47).<br/>The control promised by the Enlightenment, the power of the intellect to overcome chaos (environmental and emotional), is therefore at least partly a defensive and at times dangerous illusion. In our age of anxiety, with the destruction of civilization threatened by nuclear holocaust, ecosystemic collapse, bioweapons and dirty bombs, Freud's warning is more relevant than ever:<br/>Humans* have gained control over the forces of nature to such an extent that with their help they would have no difficulty in exterminating one another to the last man ... hence comes a large part of their current unrest, their unhappiness and their mood of anxiety.<br/>(Freud 1930: 135)<br/>Freud's binaries 'masculine/Enlightenment/control/autonomy' versus 'feminine/nature/chaos<br/>AND<br/>"third" party is always regarded ... as a threat' (ibid.).<br/>Deleuze and Guattari describe such dualistic forms of thinking using the ecological metaphor of the <br/>AND<br/>of 'holding environments', the ultimate 'environment mother' (Winnicott 1999,1987).</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>Liberal/Democratic Peace/Trade Solves War&nbsp;</p><p>in AT pinker democratic peace<br/>Democratic/liberal peace theory ignores the violence that goes into creating pliant regimes willing to trade with the US-~--naturalizes mass violence in the interim and makes long term collapse inevitable <br/>Herman 12—professor emeritus of finance at the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania (Edward, 7/25/12, Reality Denial : Steven Pinker's Apologetics for Western-Imperial Volence, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.zcommunications.org/reality-denial-steven-pinkers-apologetics-for-western-imperial-volence-by-edward-s-herman-and-david-peterson-1)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.zcommunications.org/reality-denial-steven-pinkers-apologetics-for-western-imperial-volence-by-edward-s-herman-and-david-peterson-1)%27" tppabs="http://www.zcommunications.org/reality-denial-steven-pinkers-apologetics-for-western-imperial-volence-by-edward-s-herman-and-david-peterson-1)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.zcommunications.org/reality-denial-steven-pinkers-apologetics-for-western-imperial-volence-by-edward-s-herman-and-david-peterson-1)</span></a></span></p><p>Pinker’s establishment ideology kicks-in very clearly in his comparative treatment of communism, <br/>AND<br/>of economic reform,” Jawaharal Nehru University economist Utsa Patnaik observes.154&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>AT Kurasawa</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>Kurasawa concludes neg—<br/>a.

They simply make too much sense to the people who matter.<br/>With robots taking on more and more roles, and humans ever further out of the loop, some wonder whether human warriors will eventually be rendered obsolete.

Much like a football quarterback, the human soldier would call the “play” for robots to carry out, but like the players on the field, the robots would have the latitude to change what they did if the situation shifted. <br/>The military, then, doesn’t expect to replace all its soldiers with robots anytime <br/>AND<br/>soldiers in these units will also be circumscribed by their orders and rules.</p><p>Rejecting all use of deadly force in counter-terrorism is just as immoral as saying the U.S. is purely innocent---the only true ethical option is the middle ground that views carrying out violence as a sad duty rather than a joyful act of revenge &nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>Slavoj Zizek 2, international man of mystery, 2002, Welcome to the Desert of the Real, p. 48-52<br/>September 11 is already being appropriated for ideological causes: from the claims in all <br/>AND<br/>is to locate it in the context of the antagonisms of global capitalism. <br/>We do not yet know what consequences this event will have for the economy, <br/>AND<br/>USA is not its excess of power, but its lack of it. <br/>The WTC attacks confront us with the necessity of resisting the temptation of a double <br/>AND<br/>its other, of the forces which resist it on 'fundamentalist' ideological grounds. <br/>Consequently, of the two main stories which emerged after September 11, both are <br/>AND<br/>has to do it without getting involved in the obscene mathematics of guilt.)</p><p>1NC&nbsp;</p><p>Targeted killing’s vital to counterterrorism---disrupts leadership and makes carrying out attacks impossible <br/>Kenneth Anderson 13, Professor of International Law at American University, June 2013, “The Case for Drones,” Commentary, Vol. 135, No. 6<br/>Targeted killing of high-value terrorist targets, by contrast, is the end result of a long, independent intelligence process.

According to the Jeff McMahan of Rutgers University:<br/>…the Orthodox View among moral theorists is that, while it is normally or <br/>AND<br/>of harm to, or is engaged in harming, another person.49<br/>Therefore, if terrorists present themselves as imminent threats, they lose their right to innocence during a time of war and can therefore be killed within the law of war. <br/>However, for the Orthodox View to apply one must be able to use the <br/>AND<br/>United States’ actions against al-Qaeda and other terrorist organizations is war.<br/>Some question whether the analogy of war applies to the targeted killing of terrorists. Michael Gross, Chair of the Department of International Relations at The University of Haifa, Israel claims that:<br/>Soldiers fight anonymously, as agents for the political communities they defend, and without any ‘personal’ grievances against their adversary. This is part of the veil that soldiers must wear to override the normal human aversion to murder. But naming names lifts the veil, pushing self-defence perilously close to premeditated murder and beyond the pale of permissible warfare. 50 <br/>What he is claiming is that the difference between what happens in war and through targeted killings is the naming of the target. According to him, no longer is the battle soldier simply fighting soldiers, but now people are being named, which is somehow different than conventional war. He claims that naming your target is akin to murder.<br/>Though Gross claims that this is somewhat different than conventional warfare, he is wrong<br/>AND<br/>other soldiers. Instead, this is a form of naming their targets.<br/>The naming argument fails on another level as well. Contrary to Gross’s assumption, <br/>AND<br/>exclusively a post September 11th concept and has been used during conventional wars. <br/>Gross’s claim that the practice of targeted killing is “morally abhorrent”54 is <br/>AND<br/>yet going after specific threats is reprehensible is a false and absurd claim.<br/>The claim that targeted killings are similar to premeditated murder is also preposterous. &nbsp;What <br/>AND<br/>.

For him, rebellion means something restricted, something that respects its own limits. <br/>The rebels who ... wanted to construct ... a savage immortality are terrified at the prospect of being obliged to kill in their turn. Nevertheless, if they retreat they must accept death; if they advance they must accept murder. Rebellion, cut off from its origins and cynically travestied, oscillates, on all levels, between sacrifice and murder.24 <br/>In other words, rebellion is characterized by a recognition that the status quo is <br/>AND<br/>done. As we will see, that limit is marked by murder. <br/>Moreover, that limit is dependent upon the beginnings of the rebellion. “I <br/>AND<br/>as all must be equal in their ability to make the same declaration. <br/>Rebellion is the assertion of an axiom of equality between one and all. “In assigning oppression a limit within which begins the dignity26 common to all men, rebellion defined a primary value” (R 281). Camus’ formulation necessitates an understanding?an ethical principle?of equality that rebels must recognize. Rebellion is the very process of the assertion of this egalitarianism. We can already begin to see, then, how Camus’ axiom is an ethical principle. <br/>But this point further implies that the claim of rebellion?a claim to act <br/>AND<br/>towards all?they have a limit on what they can not do. <br/>But, against Badiou, they also have a limit on what they can do. The result of the ‘universal value’ defined by the axiom/principle in Camus’ formulation is a limit placed upon rebels. This limit is murder: <br/>Murder is thus a desperate exception or it is nothing. It is the limit that can be reached but once, after which one must die. The rebel ... kills and dies so that it shall be clear that murder is impossible. He demonstrates that, in reality, he prefers the ‘We are’ to the ‘We shall be.’ ... Beyond the farthest frontier, contradiction and nihilism begin. (R 282) <br/>This passage contains the core of The Rebel. Camus condemns any logic that justifies murder on the grounds of a history?either because it helps bring about a desired future state or because it is part of a larger, necessary historical epoch. He denies any logic that determinatively ties ethical action to a historical context, subsuming particular situations under history. <br/>To justify an act by history is to implicitly de-value the present. <br/>AND<br/>providing a framework to make historical change sensible even as it is ongoing. <br/>The axiomatic aspect of rebellion’s principles conditions this thought. Camus does not claim that <br/>AND<br/>justification of their logic. Every (legitimate) rebellion has this form. <br/>And as a result, for Camus, universality is not a matter of Badiou’s <br/>AND<br/>the ethical question of them, even though it is based in particularity. <br/>This is because the actual universality Camus posits provides a substantial ethics: murder is <br/>AND<br/>of The Rebel that rebellions that have accepted murder became incoherent.27 <br/>However, Camus did not forswear murder?he claimed that it was a limit <br/>AND<br/>kills and dies so that it shall be clear that murder is impossible.” <br/>Camus navigates this paradox by insisting on murder’s exceptional status. One should rebel, <br/>AND<br/>. Their universality must be protected in the material actions throughout the rebellion. <br/>For this reason, even the legitimacy of murder is conditional.28 First<br/>AND<br/>was allowing the Terror to become an institution that altered the rebellion’s logic.</p><p>The ethics of targeted killing is not a simple question that can be answered with the 1AC’s universal “no”---we should recognize targeted killing as morally problematic but nevertheless required by the imperative of defending our political community from terrorists whose explicit aims include the murder of innocents.

Possibly yes.

Kincaid 3, Arnold Professor of English @ Southern Cal, Theories and Methodologies, Resist Me, You Sweet Resistible You, Kincaid, pages 1325-1333.<br/>Here’s the answer to these questions. First, resistance is conceptualized nowadays within the <br/>AND<br/>predictable and the occasion for it about as attractive as a Pentagon briefing.<br/>Which leads one to wonder why you Accepted the invitation to write on resistance.<br/>You’re going to write on resisting resistance.<br/>No. I’m going to write on writing around the idea of resistance, on <br/>AND<br/>to pit one material thing against another material thing, force, etc.<br/>Our challenge is not to resist something already out there but to bring something into existence, not to be prepared but to be fecund. More specifically, we can direct our activities toward the manufacturing of means for becoming “sufficiently interested in our lives to go on living them” (Phillips 6). Interest can be lost, but it cannot be found; it is invented. And we’re good at inventing.<br/>There’s nothing to resist out there. Of course, we can call up things from the vasty &nbsp;deep; we can write as if we were resisting.<br/>And that’s bad. &nbsp;Not bad but grooved, predictable.

And everybody is claiming victory at somebody else’s expense.<br/>And we’ve been repeating ourselves for some time now. We have become routinely competent, and competence is at war with interest.<br/>Wouldn’t it be easy to release ourselves from these imaginary dungeons of power, this discursive world of artificial demons and contrived heroisms?<br/>We need some kind of thesis here, or a summary—a look ahead or backward.<br/>The model of a discourse of resistance works in a practice secured by a worship of power as an explanatory tool and a metaphysical center. We believe that we can generate a powerful oppositional position, oppositional questions, an oppositional narrative.

While drone strikes cannot be viewed alone as an effective counterterrorism strategy, the Administration has repeatedly defended the legality of the program.<br/>Emmerson and his fellow U.N. special rapporteurs Philip Alston and Christof Heyns have repeatedly demanded that the U.S. provide more information on drone strikes—and the U.S. has repeatedly complied, issuing public statement after public statement defending every aspect of the drone program.<br/>Public statements detailing the legality and propriety of the drone program have been made by top Administration officials, including State Department Legal Adviser Harold Koh, Attorney General Eric Holder, Deputy National Security Advisor John Brennan, General Counsel for the Department of Defense Jeh Johnson, and CIA General Counsel Stephen Preston.<br/>Increased transparency will, of course, be deemed by human rights activists as insufficient where their true goal is to stop the U.S. drone program in its entirety. Unless and until the U.S. can somehow promise that no civilian casualties will result from drone strikes, such strikes will be considered violations of international law.<br/>Ignoring the U.N. probe will not make it go away, but the Obama Administration should not be so naive as to expect that its cooperation will substantively alter the investigation’s findings and conclusions.</p><p>Bivens&nbsp;</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>Ex-post review that allows Bivens suits over targeted killings would destroy battlefield effectiveness---undermines the chain of command and secrecy---the link is based on the possibility of suits, so substantive outcomes are irrelevant <br/>Richard Klingler 12, currently a partner at Sidley Austin and previously the NSC's Legal Advisor (2006-07), 7/25/12, “Bivens and/as Immunity: Richard Klingler Responds on Al-Aulaqi–and I Reply,” <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.lawfareblog.com/2012/07/bivens-andas-immunity-richard-klingler-responds-on-al-aulaqi-and-i-reply/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.lawfareblog.com/2012/07/bivens-andas-immunity-richard-klingler-responds-on-al-aulaqi-and-i-reply/%27" tppabs="http://www.lawfareblog.com/2012/07/bivens-andas-immunity-richard-klingler-responds-on-al-aulaqi-and-i-reply/"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.lawfareblog.com/2012/07/bivens-andas-immunity-richard-klingler-responds-on-al-aulaqi-and-i-reply/</span></a></span><br/>Steve’s post arguing that courts should recognize Bivens actions seeking damages from military officials based <br/>AND<br/>a matter of national security policy and the better view of the law. <br/>A Bivens action is a damages claim, directed against individual officials personally for an <br/>AND<br/>exists if an officer has no defenses to liability (such as immunity). <br/>The post’s first point, which underpins the legal analysis, is simply not correct<br/>AND<br/>no remedy exists (and that in a Souter opinion for eight Justices). <br/>Similarly, the Bivens Court’s original intention is a poor basis for implying a damages <br/>AND<br/>separation of powers cases pointing to a limited judicial role in military affairs. <br/>The post’s policy point regarding incentives that should be created for military officers to do <br/>AND<br/>that would relish the opportunities to seek damages against military officers and policymakers. <br/>As for the post’s proposed test, it fails to account for either the Bivens <br/>AND<br/>and will weigh as they resolve cases brought against military officials and policymakers.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>Immanence</p><p>Plan collapses drones --- McKelvey says doesn’t meet standard of immanance bc we plan the ops over a period of montsh&nbsp;</p><p>Expansive interpretation of imminence is key to win the entire war on terror---prevents bio and nuclear terrorism <br/>John Yoo 12, Professor of Law, University of California at Berkeley, School of Law; Visiting Scholar, American Enterprise Institute, 2011/12, “Assassination or Targeted Killings After 9/11,” New York Law School Law Review, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.nylslawreview.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Yoo-56-1.pdf  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.nylslawreview.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Yoo-56-1.pdf%27" tppabs="http://www.nylslawreview.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Yoo-56-1.pdf"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.nylslawreview.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Yoo-56-1.pdf</span></a></span><br/>Imminence is not a purely temporal concept.

More than that, though, the drone strikes need an aggressive defense against increasingly vocal critics who are moving to create around drone warfare a narrative of American wickedness and cowardice and of CIA perfidy. <br/>Here the administration has dropped the ball. It has so far failed to provide a robust affirmation of the propositions that underwrite Predator drone warfare. Namely: <br/>n Targeted killings of terrorists, including by Predators and even when the targets are American citizens, are a lawful practice; <br/>n Use of force is justified against terrorists anywhere they set up safe havens, including in states that cannot or will not prevent them; <br/>n These operations may be covert—and they are as justifiable when the CIA is tasked to carry them out secretly as when the military does so in open armed conflict. <br/>n All of the above fall within the traditional American legal view of “self-defense” in international law, and “vital national security interests” in U.S. domestic law. <br/>There are good reasons for Republicans and centrist Democrats to make common cause in defending <br/>AND<br/>view of domestic and international law for future administrations, Democratic and Republican. <br/>At the same time, congressional Republicans and centrist Democrats need to put Obama’s senior <br/>AND<br/>with hedged and narrow legal rationales from which they can later walk away. <br/>Consider, for instance, the diffidence of Harold Koh, the legal adviser of <br/>AND<br/>, and other agencies directly conducting these activities as somewhat less than reassuring. <br/>In fact, the administration’s top lawyers should offer a public legal defense of its <br/>AND<br/>S. government and will be publicly defended as such by their superiors. <br/>Even as the Obama administration increasingly relies on Predator strikes for its counterterrorism strategy, <br/>AND<br/>at stigmatizing the use of Predators as both illegal and a coward’s weapon. <br/>Stigmatizing the technology and the practice of targeted killing is only half of it, <br/>AND<br/>—either as law enforcement or as armed conflict conducted by uniformed military. <br/>The Obama administration is complacent about this emerging “international soft law” campaign. <br/>AND<br/>spun by the interlocking international “soft law” community and global media. <br/>It’s a mistake to remain oblivious to either the sense or the sensibility.

Nations will confront the same principles of deterrence, for example, when deciding to launch a targeted killing operation regardless of whether they conduct it through a drone or a covert amphibious assault team. <br/>Drones may make waging war more domestically palatable, but they don’t change the very serious risks of retaliation for an attacking state. Any state otherwise deterred from using force abroad will not significantly increase its power projection on account of acquiring drones. <br/>What’s more, the very states whose use of drones could threaten U.S. security – countries like China – are not democratic, which means that the possible political ramifications of the low risk of casualties resulting from drone use are irrelevant. For all their military benefits, putting drones into play requires an ability to meet the political and security risks associated with their use. <br/>Despite these realities, there remain a host of defensible arguments one could employ to discredit the Obama drone strategy. The legal justification for targeted killings in areas not internationally recognized as war zones is uncertain at best. <br/>Further, the short-term gains yielded by targeted killing operations in Pakistan, Somalia and Yemen, while debilitating to Al Qaeda leadership in the short-term, may serve to destroy already tenacious bilateral relations in the region and radicalize local populations. <br/>Yet, the past decade’s experience with drones bears no evidence of impending instability in the global strategic landscape. Conflict may not be any less likely in the era of drones, but the nature of 21st Century warfare remains fundamentally unaltered despite their arrival in large numbers.<br/>1NC Precedent Answers<br/>U.S. drone use doesn’t set a precedent, restraint doesn’t solve it, and norms don’t apply to drones at all in the first place <br/>Amitai Etzioni 13, professor of international relations at George Washington University, March/April 2013, “The Great Drone Debate,” Military Review, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://usacac.army.mil/CAC2/MilitaryReview/Archives/English/MilitaryReview_20130430_art004.pdf  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://usacac.army.mil/CAC2/MilitaryReview/Archives/English/MilitaryReview_20130430_art004.pdf%27" tppabs="http://usacac.army.mil/CAC2/MilitaryReview/Archives/English/MilitaryReview_20130430_art004.pdf"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://usacac.army.mil/CAC2/MilitaryReview/Archives/English/MilitaryReview_20130430_art004.pdf</span></a></span><br/>Other critics contend that by the United States using drones, it leads other countries <br/>AND<br/>have had to use bombs that would have caused much greater collateral damage. <br/>Further, the record shows that even when the United States did not develop a <br/>AND<br/>terrorist group Y—if the United States refrains from employing that technology. <br/>I am not arguing that there are no natural norms that restrain behavior.

Scott Shane notes correctly other nations such as China are building their own drones and in the future U.S. forces could be attacked by them–our forces will not have a monopoly on their use forever. Fair enough, but he goes further, suggesting our current use of drones to target terrorists will backfire: <br/>If China, for instance, sends killer drones into Kazakhstan to hunt minority Uighur Muslims it accuses of plotting terrorism, what will the United States say? What if India uses remotely controlled craft to hit terrorism suspects in Kashmir, or Russia sends drones after militants in the Caucasus? American officials who protest will likely find their own example thrown back at them. <br/>“The problem is that we’re creating an international norm” — asserting the right to strike preemptively against those we suspect of planning attacks, argues Dennis M. Gormley, a senior research fellow at the University of Pittsburgh and author of Missile Contagion, who has called for tougher export controls on American drone technology. “The copycatting is what I worry about most.” <br/>This is a familiar trope of liberal critics who are always claiming we should forego <br/>AND<br/>and cut down our own arsenal–to encourage similar restraint from Iran. <br/>The argument falls apart rather quickly because it is founded on a false premise: <br/>AND<br/>is unilateral disarmament–which is what the New York Times implicitly suggests. <br/>Imagine if we did refrain from drone strikes against al-Qaeda–what would <br/>AND<br/>.

The true costs of current US drone policy <br/>When we come to rely excessively on drone strikes as a counterterrorism tool, this has potential costs of its own. Drones strikes enable a "short-term fix" approach to counterterrorism, one that relies excessively on eliminating specific individuals deemed to be a threat, without much discussion of whether this strategy is likely to produce long-term security gains. <br/>Most counter-terrorism experts agree that in the long-term, terrorist organizations <br/>AND<br/>out against them and residents report their activities and identities to the authorities. <br/>A comprehensive counterterrorist strategy recognizes this, and therefore relies heavily on activities intended to undermine terrorist credibility within populations, as well as on activities designed to disrupt terrorist communications and financing. Much of the time, these are the traditional tools of intelligence and law enforcement. Kinetic force undeniably has a role to play in counterterrorism in certain circumstances, but it is rarely a magic bullet.<br/>In addition, overreliance on kinetic tools at the expense of other approaches can be <br/>AND<br/>, drone strikes are increasingly causing dismay and concern within the US population.<br/>As the Obama administration increases its reliance on drone strikes as the counterterrorism tool of <br/>AND<br/>Iraq war, are we creating terrorists faster than we kill them?27<br/>At the moment, there is little evidence that US drone policy – or individual drone strikes—result from a comprehensive assessment of strategic costs and benefits, as opposed to a shortsighted determination to strike targets of opportunity, regardless of long-term impact. As a military acquaintance of mine memorably put it, drone strikes remain “a tactic in search of a strategy.”<br/>4.

In light of the abuses that have taken place under the Bush administration, it is the responsibility of a new administration to insist on transparency in the drafting of new legislation.<br/>There is a long history of attempts to revise the War Powers Resolution. As new legislation is drafted, though, it will be important to focus on the central constitutional issues. Much time has been spent in debating how to address contingencies. It will be impossible to write into law any comprehensive formula for every conceivable situation, though; much more important will be establishing the fundamental principles of reform:<br/>The War Powers Resolution should explicitly prohibit executive acts of war without previous Congressional authorization. The only exception should be the executive’s power in an emergency to use short-term force to repel sudden attacks on US territories, troops or citizens.<br/>It is true that many potential conflict situations will be murky, complicated or divisive, and that quick congressional action may not always be forthcoming. Yet, history shows the folly of launching wars that are not supported by the American people.

I now have some updates on that post.<br/>The US State Department on Monday formally condemned Syria for failing to protect the US embassy complex in Damascus from a violent assault it said was encouraged by a pro-government Syrian television station.<br/>"A television station that is heavily influenced by Syrian authorities encouraged this violent demonstration," a State Department spokesperson said in a statement."<br/>So what does the world's only superpower do? Send in the Marines to get the ambassador out and protect the embassy grounds? Not in the age of Obama. In the age of Obama the US threatens... to file a lawsuit.<br/>"We strongly condemn the Syrian government's refusal to protect our embassy, and demand compensation for damages. We call on the Syrian government to fulfill its obligations to its own citizens as well," the statement said.<br/>"We are calling in the Syrian charge d'affaires to complain," said the US official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.<br/>"We feel they failed in their responsibility to protect US diplomats. We are going to condemn their slow response."<br/>Spoke on condition of anonymity? The Secretary of State hasn't got the junk to stand up there and say we're withdrawing our ambassador and instead a low-level functionary speaking on condition of anonymity is trotted out to threaten to summon the Syrian Charge d'Affaires?!?<br/>What happened to Teddy Roosevelt's 'speak softly and carry a big stick'? It looks like it's been replaced by Jimmy Carter's helicopter crash in the desert. Is this how Reagan would have responded? Is this how Bush II would have responded? Of course not. We would have seen Shock and Awe on all of Assad's palaces. Instead, Obama is going to file a lawsuit demanding compensation.

(KN: xiv)<br/>Having rendered the nuke unspeakable, Chaloupka suggests that society used the metonymies of the computer and the robot to deal with the nuke.21 Chaloupka foregrounds this discussion with the claim that nuclear war has never happened and that modern warfare is fabulously textual (echoing Baudrillard, Der Derian, Derrida, Foucault, and Virilio), has resulted in the disappearance of the warrior, and has become a batde for sign systems rather than for territory or materiality.<br/>In all this, Chaloupka seems to miss a rather immediate point: more than <br/>AND<br/>ways in which nuclear war has been ongoing in the last five decades,</p><p>&nbsp;both in the West and elsewhere.<br/>Chaloupka argues that once one has given up on metaphysical conceits, one of the ways in which to continue to politicize and oppose the reigning fictions masquerading as truth is to ceaselessly ironize them. Discussing the dramatic shifts in East Europe and the former Soviet Union, Chaloupka notes:<br/>A distinctive feature of these transformations is that they elude capture by the existing ideological <br/>AND<br/>of critical theory, either for that matter). (KN: 121)<br/>Unfortunately, Chaloupka is unable to maintain this unremittingly postmodernist posture and cannot resist the temptation to enlist the recent changes in Europe and US-Soviet relations as illustrating the effectivity of a postmodernist politics. He thus makes the following highly unconvincing claim:<br/>Opposition to new forms of authority, propitious use of speed and fractal character of change, the sometimes frivolous attitude towards the ends of radical action—all of these were evident in 1989 and 1990, and each confirms the possibility of postmodern oppositional tactics ... Gorbachev and Reagan had finally issued forth an unmistakably postmodern era, a triumph of deconstructive strategies. What else could the removal of the Berlin Wall mean? (KN: 123-25)<br/>To argue from a putative similarity between (textual) strategies of postmodernist practice and the events of 1989 and 1990 that there was some kind of causal connection, or that this somehow demonstrates the political effectiveness of postmodernist politics, sounds disingenuous. Whatever else the collapse of the Berlin Wall might signify, the claim that it "confirms the possibility of postmodern oppositional tactics" will have to be substantiated by convincing empirical argumentation and not mere assertion.</p><p>CP<br/>Overview<br/>Terror is a real threat driven by forces the aff can’t resolve---we should reform the war on terror, not vulnerability---any terror attack turns the entire case <br/>Peter Beinart 8, associate professor of journalism and political science at CUNY, The Good Fight; Why Liberals – and only Liberals – Can Win the War on Terror and Make America Great Again, vii-viii<br/>APPLYING THAT TRADITION today is not easy.

For Washington is setting a precedent whereby states can send drones, often over sovereign borders, to kill foreigners or their own citizens, who are deemed threats. <br/>Other states may also follow Washington’s example and develop their own criteria to define imminent threats and use drones to counter them. <br/>Washington will find it increasingly difficult to protest other nations’ targeted killing programs — particularly when the United States has helped define this lethal practice. U.S. opposition will prove especially difficult when other states justify targeted killings as a matter of domestic affairs. <br/>Should enough states follow the U.S. example, the practice of preemptively targeting and killing suspected threats may develop into customary international law. <br/>Such a norm, however, which requires consistent state practice arising out of a sense of legal obligation, now looks unlikely. While targeted killing policies are arguably executed by states citing a legal obligation to protect themselves from imminent threats, widespread state practice is still uncommon. <br/>But international law does not forbid drones. And given the lack of an international regime to control drones, state and non-state actors are free to determine their future use. <br/>This lack of international consensus about how to control drones stems from a serious contradiction in incentives. Though drones pose grave challenges, they also offer states lethal and non-lethal capabilities that are of great appeal. Because the potential for drone technology is virtually limitless, states are now unwilling to control how drones evolve.</p><p>1NC Precedent Answers</p><p>U.S. drone use doesn’t set a precedent, restraint doesn’t solve it, and norms don’t apply to drones at all in the first place <br/>Amitai Etzioni 13, professor of international relations at George Washington University, March/April 2013, “The Great Drone Debate,” Military Review, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://usacac.army.mil/CAC2/MilitaryReview/Archives/English/MilitaryReview_20130430_art004.pdf  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://usacac.army.mil/CAC2/MilitaryReview/Archives/English/MilitaryReview_20130430_art004.pdf%27" tppabs="http://usacac.army.mil/CAC2/MilitaryReview/Archives/English/MilitaryReview_20130430_art004.pdf"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://usacac.army.mil/CAC2/MilitaryReview/Archives/English/MilitaryReview_20130430_art004.pdf</span></a></span><br/>Other critics contend that by the United States using drones, it leads other countries <br/>AND<br/>have had to use bombs that would have caused much greater collateral damage. <br/>Further, the record shows that even when the United States did not develop a <br/>AND<br/>terrorist group Y—if the United States refrains from employing that technology. <br/>I am not arguing that there are no natural norms that restrain behavior.

A protracted financial crisis could threaten the survival of friendly regimes from Pakistan to the Middle East while forcing Western nations to cut spending on defense, intelligence and foreign aid, the sources said.<br/>The crisis could also accelerate the shift to a more Asia-centric globe, as rising powers such as China gain more leverage over international financial institutions and greater influence in world capitals.<br/>Some of the more troubling and immediate scenarios analysts are weighing involve nuclear-armed Pakistan, which already was being battered by inflation and unemployment before the global financial tsunami hit. Since September, Pakistan has seen its national currency devalued and its hard-currency reserves nearly wiped out.<br/>Analysts also worry about the impact of plummeting crude prices on oil-dependent nations such as Yemen, which has a large population of unemployed youths and a history of support for militant Islamic groups.</p><p>UQ Wall<br/>We’ll raise the debt ceiling now – Obama’s got the

Substantive constraints on the debate are key to actualize effective pluralism and agonistic democracy <br/>John Dryzek 6, Professor of Social and Political Theory, The Australian National University, Reconciling Pluralism and Consensus as Political Ideals, American Journal of Political Science,Vol. 50, No. 3, July 2006, Pp. 634–649<br/>A more radical contemporary pluralism is suspicious of liberal and communitarian devices for reconciling difference<br/>AND<br/>ofliberal theory that looks neutral but in practice supports and serves the powerful.<br/>Difference democrats are hostile to consensus, partly because consensus decisionmaking (of the sort <br/>AND<br/>which Young also subscribes; 2000, 49–51), Mouffe states:<br/>To negate the ineradicable character of antagonism and aim at a universal rational consensus— that is the real threat to democracy. Indeed, this can lead to violence being unrecognized and hidden behind appeals to “rationality,” as is often the case in liberal thinking. (1996, 248)<br/>Mouffe is a radical pluralist: “By pluralism I mean the end of a <br/>AND<br/>respect” as “a critical pluralist ethos” (1999, 70).<br/>Mouffe and Young both want pluralism to be regulated by a particular kind of attitude<br/>AND<br/>need principles to regulate the substance of what rightfully belongs in democratic debate.&nbsp;</p><p>Constraints on deliberation are necessary to re-found the political---an untamed agon eviscerates political action and judgment skills <br/>Dana Villa 96—prof of political science, Amherst, Beyond Good and Evil: Arendt, Nietzsche, and the Aestheticization of Political Action, Political Theory, Vol. 20, No. 2 (May, 1992), pp. 274-308<br/>The representative thinking made possible by disinterested judgment is Arendt‘s Kantian version of <br/>AND<br/>conditions,” thereby freeing us for the purely public aspect of the phenomenon.<br/>The difference between genealogical "objectivity" and representative judgment, between the kind of <br/>AND<br/>in Nietzsche's phrase, with the "yay and nay of the palate.""°<br/>For Kant, the significance and implications of aesthetic distance are quite opposite. As <br/>AND<br/>Indeed, Kant describes taste itself as “a kind of sensus communism“<br/>The aesthetic distance achieved by representative thought thus points to the “grounding” of <br/>AND<br/>look and sound, what we will see and what men will hear in<br/>Kant‘s theory of judgment thus opens a space between the false objectivism of <br/>AND<br/>Arendt’s opinion, because it preserves appearance and perspective without abolishing the world.<br/>We can sum up the achievement of Kant’s theory of judgment by saying that it <br/>AND<br/>everyone else’ in the hope of coming to an agreement with him eventually.”"°<br/>Taste judgments are, in a word, redeemed deliberatively. Kant's conception of aesthetic judgment—departing from the exchange of viewpoints necessary for representative thinking and culminating in the persuasive exchange that accompanies the rendering of each judgment—is thus, for Arendt, political through and through.‘51 It requires an ongoing process of exchange and deliberation, one "without criteria," as Lyotard would say)“<br/>This is yet another reason why Kantian taste judgment is the appropriate model for Arendt’s <br/>AND<br/>action and judgment but, at best. a kind of regulative ideal.<br/>The turn to Kant thus enables Arendt to avoid the antipolitical tendencies encountered in the <br/>AND<br/>in validity to the degree that it has liberated itself from merely individual idiosyncrasiesm’<br/>The agon is tamed, then, not by retreating from the aestheticization of action but by following its anti-Platonic impulse through to the end. The "completion" of the theory of action by a Kant-inspired theory of judgment retains the focus on action as something heroic or extraordinary, as beyond<br/>good and evil. It does so, however, by shifting the emphasis from <br/>AND<br/>that Arendt draws between greatness and beauty in "The Crisis in Culture":<br/>Generally speaking, culture indicates that the public realm, which is rendered politically secure <br/>AND<br/>world, all human life would be futile and no greatness could endure.<br/>Arendtian aestheticism, an aestheticism predicated on a love of the world and which admires <br/>AND<br/>activity itself. The result is that performance is denigrated, action misconceived.<br/>Nietzsche, of course, has even less use for homo faber than Arendt, <br/>AND<br/>in terms of what Lacoue-Labarthe calls a “mimetology,” while Nietzsche<br/>repudiates again and again all metaphors of correspondence or adequation, does not alter their <br/>AND<br/>by plurality and which enables the fullest, most articulated expression of difference.<br/>CONCLUSION <br/>Arendt resists the Habermasian temptation to seek quasi-transcendental standards of agreement in a <br/>AND<br/>reflexive discovery of rules in light of indeterminate, transcendent ideas of community”<br/>The critique of Aristotelian/oommunitarian thinking is also applicable to the kind of postmodern <br/>AND<br/>problematic, but it does serve to underline the falseness of this dichotomy.<br/>One may grant that Arendl's aesthcticism avoids the trope of the fiction du polin'que, <br/>AND<br/>, than a recovery of ethos or the legislation of a proceduralist rationality.<br/>"Hie simple answer to this objection is mat Arendt completely agrees. Her work stands not only as a comprehensive rethinking of the nature and meaning of political action but as an extended mediation on how the energies<br/>of modernity have worked to dissipate our feeling for the world, to alienate us <br/>AND<br/>in which stable boundaries and distinctions have been dissolved and rendered virtually impossible.<br/>The postmodernist will object that Arendtian aestheticism. unlike Nietzsche's, mourns the loss of <br/>AND<br/>the possibility of meaning created by political action and redeemed by political judgment.</p><p>The impact outweighs—deliberative debate models impart skills vital to respond to existential threats<br/>Christian O.

One such threat — cheap and deadly — is the naval mine. <br/>Mines are indiscriminate, easily procured and laid. And they have a potent psychological effect on commercial shippers. Not only can they sink vessels, they can grind the gears of international business to a halt. By limiting our access, naval mines can also put at jeopardy our ability to defend national interests in a given area or chokepoint. <br/>And there are vital chokepoints all over the world. <br/>Consistent with the new Defense Strategy, we will place a renewed emphasis on those chokepoints in the Asia-Pacific region while continuing to focus on the same in the Middle East.

"They will consume a large amount of steel and cement. This means that emissions will not be reduced for some time."<br/>The problem with the global target, according to the report, was that the two-degree limit – which was formally adopted by G8 nations in July – does not make adequate concessions for the industrialisation of developing countries.<br/>The report said that in order to even get close to the target, it was up to wealthy nations to make carbon emission cuts of at least 90 per cent on 1990 levels by 2050.

Model, Resource, or Outlier? What Effect Has the U.S. Constitution Had on the Recently Adopted Constitutions of Other Nations?, 29 May 2013, www.heritage.org/research/lecture/2013/05/model-resource-or-outlier-what-effect-has-the-us-constitution-had-on-the-recently-adopted-constitutions-of-other-nations<br/>Unsurprisingly, attempting to gauge one constitution’s “influence” on another involves various conceptual and methodological challenges. To illustrate, a highly generic constitution may be generic because others have followed its lead, because it has modeled others, or simply by coincidence. That said, if two constitutions are becoming increasingly dissimilar, by definition, one cannot be following the other. That is, neither is exerting influence on the other (at least not in a positive way).<br/>This is the phenomenon we observed in comparing the U.S. Constitution to <br/>AND<br/>World War II, but even that similarity has decreased since the 1960s.<br/>Rights provisions are not the only constitutional elements that have lost favor with the rest of the world; structural provisions pioneered by American constitutionalism—such as federalism, presidentialism, and judicial review—have also been losing their global appeal.<br/>For instance, in the early 20th century, 22 percent of constitutions provided for federalistic systems, while today, just 12 percent do.<br/>A similar trend has occurred for presidentialism, another American innovation. Since the end of World War II, the percentage of countries employing purely presidential systems has declined, mainly in favor of mixed systems, which were a favorite of former Soviet bloc countries.<br/>Finally, though judicial review is not mentioned in the U.S. Constitution<br/>AND<br/>exercised American-style constitutional review; today, fewer than half do.<br/>Reasons for the Decline<br/>It appears that several factors are driving the U.S. Constitution’s increasing atypicality. First, while in 2006 the average national constitutions contained 34 rights (of the 60 we identify), the U.S. Constitution contains relatively few—just 21—and the rights it does contain are often themselves atypical.<br/>Just one-third of constitutions provide for church and state separation, as does the U.S. Establishment Clause, and only 2 percent of constitutions (including, e.g., Mexico and Guatemala) contain a “right to bear arms.” Conversely, the U.S. Constitution omits some of the most globally popular rights, such as women’s rights, the right to social security, the right to food, and the right to health care.<br/>These peculiarities, together with the fact that the U.S. Constitution is both old and particularly hard to amend, have led some to characterize the Constitution as simply antiquated or obsolete.</p><p>Model Fails <br/>Modeling fails – constitutions must be endogenous<br/>Mila Versteeg 13, Associate Professor at the University of Virginia School of Law.

Allan saw through this to document how the water budgets of the Middle East were accounted for without conflict.<br/>Allan wrote about embedded water for a few years without it exciting any comment. Then, on a dark Monday afternoon in November 1992, during a routine SOAS seminar, somebody used the term 'virtual' water to describe the same concept. Allan realized this attention-grabbing word, in vogue with the computer-literate younger generation, would catch on better than his own term.

As a country becomes richer, it may require more water overall to sustain its booming population, but it can afford to import food to make up the shortfall5.<br/>Areas seemingly desperate for water arrive at sustainable solutions thanks to the import of food, reducing the demand for water and giving an invisible boost to domestic supplies.

These are as follows:<br/>• Ecosystem degradation. The United Nations (UN) Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, compiled by 1,360 scientists from 95 countries and released in 2005 (with virtually no impact beyond the environmental sciences), has confirmed for the first time that 60 of the ecosystems upon which human systems depend for survival are degraded.7<br/>• Global warming.

This is what the mainstream literature on unsustainable development is worried about. This marks what is now increasingly referred to as the Anthropocene – the era in which humans have become the primary force of historico-geophysical evolution.23<br/>Significantly, although these seven documents are in the policy domain they reflect the outcomes <br/>AND<br/>that paved the way for the Enlightenment and the industrial epoch that followed. <br/>Clark et al. date the second Copernican revolution to the meeting in 2001 when <br/>AND<br/>appropriate for a more sustainable world and the associated ethics would be unviable.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>Case</p><p>Warfighting<br/>*AT: Heg Solves War <br/>More ev---their data’s flawed<br/>Christopher Preble 10, director of Foreign Policy Studies at the CATO Institute, August 3, 2010, “U.S. Military Power: Preeminence for What Purpose?,” online: <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/u-s-military-power-preeminence-for-what-purpose/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/u-s-military-power-preeminence-for-what-purpose/%27" tppabs="http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/u-s-military-power-preeminence-for-what-purpose/"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/u-s-military-power-preeminence-for-what-purpose/</span></a></span><br/>Most in Washington still embraces the notion that America is, and forever will be<br/>AND<br/>in their own defense, and in the security of their respective regions.<br/>But while there are credible alternatives to the United States serving in its current dual <br/>AND<br/>States while the schlubs in fly-over country pick up the tab.<br/>No data suggests a causal link between unipolarity and peace<br/>Christopher Fettweis 10, Professor of Political Science at Tulane University, 2010, Dangerous Times?

First, domestic political theories assume that interest groups predominantly push for more expansive overseas commitments. Yet domestic interest groups possess much more complicated and nuanced preferences than is commonly assumed. For example, many domestic interest groups oppose overseas commitments, favoring expenditure on domestic programs rather than adventures abroad.<br/>Second, groups favoring assertive foreign policies do not speak with one voice or assign equal priority to all interests. Different interest groups will place different weight on particular regions, economic sectors, or types of international challenges.34 The heterogeneity of domestic interests is critical because it opens up space for politicians to outmaneuver domestic groups and force trade-offs on unwilling lobbies.<br/>Third, domestic political theories are unclear about when domestic interests are able to hijack <br/>AND<br/>specifying which veto points are most significant and when they will prove decisive.<br/>Fourth, domestic political theories tend to downplay or ignore the ability of international context <br/>AND<br/>relative decline that one should expect partisan rancor and sectoral rivalry to recede.<br/>The U.S. won’t cling to hegemony---momentum’s growing for retrenchment but not solidified yet <br/>Paul K.

We counter that there are deductive and empirical reasons to doubt this argument. Theoretically, hegemonic powers should actually find it easier to manage acute relative decline. Fallen hegemons still have formidable capability, which threatens grave harm to any state that tries to cross them.

What the drone adds to that intelligence might be considerable, through its surveillance capabilities -- but much of the drone's contribution will be tactical, providing intelligence that assists in the planning and execution of the strike itself, in order to pick the moment when there might be the fewest civilian casualties.<br/>Nonetheless, in conjunction with high-quality intelligence, drone warfare offers an unparalleled means to strike directly at terrorist organizations without needing a conventional or counterinsurgency approach to reach terrorist groups in their safe havens. It offers an offensive capability, rather than simply defensive measures, such as homeland security alone. Drone warfare offers a raiding strategy directly against the terrorists and their leadership.<br/>If one believes, as many of the critics of drone warfare do, that <br/>AND<br/>common enemies are examples of the methods that are just of military nature.<br/>Drone warfare today is integrated with a much larger strategic counterterrorism target -- one in <br/>AND<br/>acknowledged in communications, have a significant impact on planning and organizational effectiveness.</p><p>Constraining targeted killing’s role in the war on terror causes extinction <br/>Louis Rene Beres 11, Professor of Political Science and International Law at Purdue, 2011, “After Osama bin Laden: Assassination, Terrorism, War, and International Law,” Case Western Reserve Journal of International Law, 44 Case W.

Although the controversial ceasefire accords Islamabad earlier negotiated with tribal leaders have formally collapsed, the Pakistani Army has repeatedly postponed announced plans to occupy North Waziristan, which is where the Afghan insurgents and the foreign fighters supporting them and al-Qaeda are concentrated. <br/>Such a move that would meet fierce resistance from the region’s population, which has traditionally enjoyed extensive autonomy. The recent massive floods have also forced the military to divert its assets to humanitarian purposes, especially helping the more than ten million displaced people driven from their homes. <br/>But the main reason for their not attacking the Afghan Taliban or its foreign allies based in Pakistan’s tribal areas is that doing so would result in their joining the Pakistani Taliban in its vicious fight with the Islamabad government. <br/>Yet, sending in U.S. combat troops on recurring raids or a protracted occupation of Pakistani territory would provoke widespread outrage in Pakistan and perhaps in other countries as well since the UN Security Council mandate for the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan only authorizes military operations in Pakistan. <br/>On the one known occasion when U.S. Special Forces actually conducted a <br/>AND<br/>U.S. forces attempting to cross the Afghan-Pakistan border. <br/>On several occasions since then, Pakistani troops and militia have fired at what they believed to be American helicopters flying from Afghanistan to deploy Special Forces on their territory, though there is no conclusive evidence that the U.S. military has ever attempted another large-scale commando raid in Pakistan after the September 2008 incident. <br/>Further large-scale U.S. military operations into Pakistan could easily rally popular support behind the Taliban and al-Qaeda. It might even precipitate the collapse of the Islambad government and its replacement by a regime in nuclear-armed Pakistan that is less friendly to Washington. <br/>Given these alternatives, continuing the drone strikes appears to be the best of the limited options available to deal with a core problem, giving sanctuary to terrorists striking US and coalition forces in Afghanistan and beyond.<br/>AT: Pakistan Collapse<br/>No Pakistani collapse --- reject Pitt, he’s a NYT writer<br/>Sunil Dasgupta 13 Ph.D. in political science and the director of UMBC's Political Science Program and a senior fellow at Brookings, 2/25/13, "How will India respond to civil war in Pakistan," East Asia Forum, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2013/02/25/how-will-india-respond-to-civil-war-in-pakistan/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2013/02/25/how-will-india-respond-to-civil-war-in-pakistan/%27" tppabs="http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2013/02/25/how-will-india-respond-to-civil-war-in-pakistan/"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2013/02/25/how-will-india-respond-to-civil-war-in-pakistan/</span></a></span><br/>Bill Keller of the New York Times has described Pakistani president Asif Ail Zardari as <br/>AND<br/>out a Pakistani civil war while covertly coordinating policy with the United States.<br/>No impact <br/>Tepperman 9—Deputy Editor at Newsweek.

Scott Shane notes correctly other nations such as China are building their own drones and in the future U.S. forces could be attacked by them–our forces will not have a monopoly on their use forever. Fair enough, but he goes further, suggesting our current use of drones to target terrorists will backfire: <br/>If China, for instance, sends killer drones into Kazakhstan to hunt minority Uighur Muslims it accuses of plotting terrorism, what will the United States say? What if India uses remotely controlled craft to hit terrorism suspects in Kashmir, or Russia sends drones after militants in the Caucasus? American officials who protest will likely find their own example thrown back at them. <br/>“The problem is that we’re creating an international norm” — asserting the right to strike preemptively against those we suspect of planning attacks, argues Dennis M. Gormley, a senior research fellow at the University of Pittsburgh and author of Missile Contagion, who has called for tougher export controls on American drone technology. “The copycatting is what I worry about most.” <br/>This is a familiar trope of liberal critics who are always claiming we should forego <br/>AND<br/>and cut down our own arsenal–to encourage similar restraint from Iran. <br/>The argument falls apart rather quickly because it is founded on a false premise: <br/>AND<br/>is unilateral disarmament–which is what the New York Times implicitly suggests. <br/>Imagine if we did refrain from drone strikes against al-Qaeda–what would <br/>AND<br/>.

Whether launched in peacetime or during a crisis, a preemptive strike would likely leave China with no means of nuclear retaliation against American territory. And given the trends in both arsenals, China may live under the shadow of U.S. nuclear primacy for years to come.<br/>This assessment is based on unclassified information, standard targeting principles, and formulas that <br/>AND<br/>silos. Chinese leaders would have little or no warning of the attack.<br/>During the Cold War, U.S. submarines posed little danger to China’s <br/>AND<br/>is virtually assured (the likelihood is calculated as greater than 99 percent).<br/>In reality, American planners could not assume such near-perfect results. Some <br/>AND<br/>in American counterforce capabilities since the end of the Cold War is staggering.)<br/>Beyond bolstering the ability to conduct a first strike, the improvements to U.<br/>AND<br/>, can be more discriminating, if planners want to minimize civilian casualties.<br/>A second key decision for war planners is whether to set the weapon to detonate <br/>AND<br/>falls to earth in the hours after the blast, spreading lethal radiation.<br/>Airbursts create smaller zones of extremely high overpressure, but they also generate very little <br/>AND<br/>and over a very wide area, greatly reducing the harm to civilians.<br/>In the past, a nuclear attack on China’s arsenal would have had horrific humanitarian <br/>AND<br/>have contemplated such a strike, but only in the most dire circumstances.<br/>But things are changing radically. Improved accuracy now allows war planners to target hardened <br/>AND<br/>generation of GPS satellites—with higher-powered signals to complicate jamming.<br/>The payoff for equipping cruise missiles (or nuclear bombs) with GPS is clear <br/>AND<br/>, allies, or territory might be more inclined to choose preemptive action. <br/>Strategic Implications of the Nuclear Imbalance<br/>The most plausible flash point for a serious U.S.-China conflict is <br/>AND<br/>solution (for example, a return to Taiwan’s pre-declaration status).<br/>By putting its nuclear forces on alert, however, China’s leaders would compel a U.S. president to make a very difficult decision: to accede to blackmail (by agreeing to a cease-fire and pressuring the Taiwanese to renounce independence), to assume that the threat is a bluff (a dangerous proposition, given that each Chinese ICBM carries a city-busting 4,000-kiloton warhead), or to strike the Chinese missiles before they could be launched.<br/>How do America’s growing counterforce capabilities affect this scenario? First, American nuclear primacy may prevent such a war in the first place. China’s leaders understand that their military now has little hope of defeating U.S. air and naval forces. If they also recognize that their nuclear arsenal is vulnerable—and that placing it on alert might trigger a preemptive strike—the leaders may conclude that war is a no-win proposition.<br/>Second, if a war over Taiwan started anyway, U.S. nuclear primacy might help contain the fighting at the conventional level. Early in the crisis, Washington could quietly convey to Beijing that the United States would act decisively if China put its vulnerable nuclear arsenal on alert.<br/>Finally, if China threatened to launch nuclear attacks against America’s allies, its territory<br/>AND<br/>he or she would reap the benefits of the past decade’s counterforce upgrades.<br/>Plan and perm make first strike impossible – Congress would never approve a first strike, and waiting until a crisis makes it less likely to be successful<br/>James J.

Intra-Agency Process<br/>Another similar check is the "intra-agency process," in which the circulation of proposed decisions within the agency empowers dissidents and harnesses a diversity of thinking. n255 If nothing else, the process catches errors, or at least increases the odds of avoiding them, given the number of people who must review or approve a document or decision within the agency. n256<br/>3. Agency or Lawyer Culture<br/>The culture of a particular agency - the institutional self-awareness of its professionalism - provides another check. n257 "Lawyer culture" - which places high value on competency and adherence to rules and laws - resides at the core of agency culture; n258 its "nay-saying" objectivity "is especially important in the small inner circle of presidential decision making to counter the tendency towards groupthink and a vulnerability to sycophancy." n259<br/>&nbsp;*677 <br/>4.

But if a report released by Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense (MND) on Friday is any indication, Taiwanese government officials don’t appear to be convinced that such détente will last for very long. <br/>Without doubt, the pace of normalization in relations between Taiwan and China, especially <br/>AND<br/>currency into U.S. dollars before a transaction can be made. <br/>Beyond trade, visits to Taiwan by Chinese officials have become almost routine, a limited number of Chinese can now study at Taiwan’s universities, Chinese tourism to the island has boomed, and joint exercises by the countries’ respective coast guards are now held every other year since 2010, mostly for the purpose of sea-rescue operations in the waters off Taiwan’s Kinmen and China’s Xiamen. <br/>While those developments have for the most part contributed to a less tense, if <br/>AND<br/>missile build-up targeting Taiwan — would undermine his efforts at rapprochement. <br/>For one reason or another, that restraint seems to have disappeared. Officials are <br/>AND<br/>has acquired enough amphibious transport vehicles or when the situation calls for it. <br/>Additionally, the report said the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) had been hard at work improving its electronic warfare (EW) capabilities so that it can operate in a complex EW environment, while pointing to signs that China could turn to all-put psychological warfare to sow confusion in Taiwan ahead of a military campaign. <br/>The report also states that the MND was expanding its Communication Electronics and Information Bureau <br/>AND<br/>than 1 million cyber-attacks, the great majority coming from China. <br/>Such signaling, which was immediately picked up by the local media, could not have been made without the consent of senior government officials. Several factors can help explain why Taiwan is hardening its position. These include the need for increased military preparedness ahead of the expected pressure from Beijing for the two sides to enter sensitive political negotiations. Already there are signs that China has begun turning the screws on this issue. <br/>Another possibility is that Taipei may have realized that despite the recent “goodwill,” <br/>AND<br/>territorial claims in those two areas (claims that Taipei has systematically denied). <br/>Other possible factors include institutional turf battles and efforts by the MND to obtain a <br/>AND<br/>an opportunity to secure future military assistance deals with the U.S. <br/>Whatever the reason, Taipei is fully aware that Taiwanese prefer the “status quo<br/>AND<br/>pliant, administration in Taipei, Taiwan’s response has to be in kind. <br/>The signaling may be a subtle shift, but it’s a step in the right <br/>AND<br/>A strong defense is the best insurance Taiwan can buy at this point.</p><p>Peaceful relations will inevitably break down---Chinese impatience, Taiwanese moves toward independence <br/>Szu-yin Ho 11, Professor of Political Science, National Chengchi University, 11/10/11, “Under the Shadow of a Rising Great Power,” <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.aei.org/files/2012/09/26/-under-the-shadow-of-a-rising-great-power_151048132170.pdf  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.aei.org/files/2012/09/26/-under-the-shadow-of-a-rising-great-power_151048132170.pdf%27" tppabs="http://www.aei.org/files/2012/09/26/-under-the-shadow-of-a-rising-great-power_151048132170.pdf"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.aei.org/files/2012/09/26/-under-the-shadow-of-a-rising-great-power_151048132170.pdf</span></a></span><br/>Given Taiwanese and Chinese efforts as well as US encouragement of these efforts, the <br/>AND<br/>opposition to Taiwan’s independence that those leaders have fostered may prove their undoing. <br/>Taiwan therefore remains a vital national security concern for China. 7 On the other <br/>AND<br/>-oriented interpretation of its modern history, and a strong besieged mentality. &nbsp;<br/>The two sides of the Taiwan Strait differ greatly in their approach to solving the <br/>AND<br/>sovereignty; rather, both sides should learn how to manage their differences. <br/>Ma’s operational formula is “mutual non-denial of the other side’s governing authority<br/>AND<br/>that it can be easily reversed should Taiwan resume its quest for independence. <br/>The current rapport between Taiwan and China might be disrupted in the future.

As it would take more than a decade for the United States to produce new nuclear weapons, ensuing events could preclude a return to anything like the status quo ante.<br/>The assertive, nuclear-armed great power, and other major adversaries, could be willing to challenge U.S. interests more directly in the expectation that the United States would be less prepared to threaten or deliver a military response that could lead to direct conflict. They will want to keep the United States from reclaiming its earlier power position.<br/>Allies and partners who have relied upon explicit or implicit assurances of U.S. nuclear protection as a foundation of their security could lose faith in those assurances. They could compensate by accommodating U.S. rivals, especially in the short term, or acquiring their own nuclear deterrents, which in most cases could be accomplished only over the mid- to long term. A more nuclear world would likely ensue over a period of years.<br/>Important U.S. interests could be compromised or abandoned, or a major war could occur as adversaries and/or the United States miscalculate new boundaries of deterrence and provocation.

First, American nuclear primacy may prevent such a war in the first place. China’s leaders understand that their military now has little hope of defeating U.S. air and naval forces. If they also recognize that their nuclear arsenal is vulnerable—and that placing it on alert might trigger a preemptive strike—the leaders may conclude that war is a no-win proposition.<br/>Second, if a war over Taiwan started anyway, U.S. nuclear primacy might help contain the fighting at the conventional level.

What the drone adds to that intelligence might be considerable, through its surveillance capabilities -- but much of the drone's contribution will be tactical, providing intelligence that assists in the planning and execution of the strike itself, in order to pick the moment when there might be the fewest civilian casualties.<br/>Nonetheless, in conjunction with high-quality intelligence, drone warfare offers an unparalleled means to strike directly at terrorist organizations without needing a conventional or counterinsurgency approach to reach terrorist groups in their safe havens. It offers an offensive capability, rather than simply defensive measures, such as homeland security alone. Drone warfare offers a raiding strategy directly against the terrorists and their leadership.<br/>If one believes, as many of the critics of drone warfare do, that <br/>AND<br/>common enemies are examples of the methods that are just of military nature.<br/>Drone warfare today is integrated with a much larger strategic counterterrorism target -- one in <br/>AND<br/>acknowledged in communications, have a significant impact on planning and organizational effectiveness.</p><p>Constraining targeted killing’s role in the war on terror causes extinction <br/>Louis Rene Beres 11, Professor of Political Science and International Law at Purdue, 2011, “After Osama bin Laden: Assassination, Terrorism, War, and International Law,” Case Western Reserve Journal of International Law, 44 Case W.

Nations will confront the same principles of deterrence, for example, when deciding to launch a targeted killing operation regardless of whether they conduct it through a drone or a covert amphibious assault team. <br/>Drones may make waging war more domestically palatable, but they don’t change the very serious risks of retaliation for an attacking state. Any state otherwise deterred from using force abroad will not significantly increase its power projection on account of acquiring drones. <br/>What’s more, the very states whose use of drones could threaten U.S. security – countries like China – are not democratic, which means that the possible political ramifications of the low risk of casualties resulting from drone use are irrelevant. For all their military benefits, putting drones into play requires an ability to meet the political and security risks associated with their use. <br/>Despite these realities, there remain a host of defensible arguments one could employ to discredit the Obama drone strategy. The legal justification for targeted killings in areas not internationally recognized as war zones is uncertain at best. <br/>Further, the short-term gains yielded by targeted killing operations in Pakistan, Somalia and Yemen, while debilitating to Al Qaeda leadership in the short-term, may serve to destroy already tenacious bilateral relations in the region and radicalize local populations. <br/>Yet, the past decade’s experience with drones bears no evidence of impending instability in the global strategic landscape. Conflict may not be any less likely in the era of drones, but the nature of 21st Century warfare remains fundamentally unaltered despite their arrival in large numbers.<br/>AT: Indo-Pak War<br/>No Indo-Pak war<br/>Mutti 9— Master’s degree in International Studies with a focus on South Asia, U Washington.

Scott Shane notes correctly other nations such as China are building their own drones and in the future U.S. forces could be attacked by them–our forces will not have a monopoly on their use forever. Fair enough, but he goes further, suggesting our current use of drones to target terrorists will backfire: <br/>If China, for instance, sends killer drones into Kazakhstan to hunt minority Uighur Muslims it accuses of plotting terrorism, what will the United States say? What if India uses remotely controlled craft to hit terrorism suspects in Kashmir, or Russia sends drones after militants in the Caucasus? American officials who protest will likely find their own example thrown back at them. <br/>“The problem is that we’re creating an international norm” — asserting the right to strike preemptively against those we suspect of planning attacks, argues Dennis M.

&nbsp;A group of judges to approve targeted lethal force would set a standard and an example. <br/>Further, as so-called “targeted killings” become more controversial with time, I believe there are some decision-makers within the Executive Branch who actually wouldn’t mind the added comfort of judicial imprimatur on their decisions. <br/>But, we must be realistic about the degree of added credibility such a court <br/>AND<br/>“drone court” operating in secret is criticized in the same way?<br/>Credibility---1NC <br/>Alternatives to drones are worse for cred---and plan’s not enough to solve <br/>Amitai Etzioni 12, senior advisor to the Carter White House; taught at Columbia University, Harvard and The University of California at Berkeley; and is a university professor and professor of international relations at The George Washington University, 4/2/12, “In Defense of Drones,” <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/defense-drones-6715  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/defense-drones-6715%27" tppabs="http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/defense-drones-6715"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/defense-drones-6715</span></a></span> <br/>Rohde acknowledges that we are dealing with people who make and plant bombs and train <br/>AND<br/>a reason we should not order more drones rather than stand them down. <br/>Why are drones so bad?

Although the controversial ceasefire accords Islamabad earlier negotiated with tribal leaders have formally collapsed, the Pakistani Army has repeatedly postponed announced plans to occupy North Waziristan, which is where the Afghan insurgents and the foreign fighters supporting them and al-Qaeda are concentrated. <br/>Such a move that would meet fierce resistance from the region’s population, which has traditionally enjoyed extensive autonomy. The recent massive floods have also forced the military to divert its assets to humanitarian purposes, especially helping the more than ten million displaced people driven from their homes. <br/>But the main reason for their not attacking the Afghan Taliban or its foreign allies based in Pakistan’s tribal areas is that doing so would result in their joining the Pakistani Taliban in its vicious fight with the Islamabad government. <br/>Yet, sending in U.S. combat troops on recurring raids or a protracted occupation of Pakistani territory would provoke widespread outrage in Pakistan and perhaps in other countries as well since the UN Security Council mandate for the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan only authorizes military operations in Pakistan. <br/>On the one known occasion when U.S. Special Forces actually conducted a <br/>AND<br/>U.S. forces attempting to cross the Afghan-Pakistan border. <br/>On several occasions since then, Pakistani troops and militia have fired at what they believed to be American helicopters flying from Afghanistan to deploy Special Forces on their territory, though there is no conclusive evidence that the U.S. military has ever attempted another large-scale commando raid in Pakistan after the September 2008 incident. <br/>Further large-scale U.S. military operations into Pakistan could easily rally popular support behind the Taliban and al-Qaeda. It might even precipitate the collapse of the Islambad government and its replacement by a regime in nuclear-armed Pakistan that is less friendly to Washington. <br/>Given these alternatives, continuing the drone strikes appears to be the best of the limited options available to deal with a core problem, giving sanctuary to terrorists striking US and coalition forces in Afghanistan and beyond.</p><p>Aggressive targeted killing policy’s key to stability in Yemen<br/>Alan W.

It has so far failed to provide a robust affirmation of the propositions that underwrite Predator drone warfare. Namely: <br/>n Targeted killings of terrorists, including by Predators and even when the targets are American citizens, are a lawful practice; <br/>n Use of force is justified against terrorists anywhere they set up safe havens, including in states that cannot or will not prevent them; <br/>n These operations may be covert—and they are as justifiable when the CIA is tasked to carry them out secretly as when the military does so in open armed conflict. <br/>n All of the above fall within the traditional American legal view of “self-defense” in international law, and “vital national security interests” in U.S. domestic law. <br/>There are good reasons for Republicans and centrist Democrats to make common cause in defending <br/>AND<br/>view of domestic and international law for future administrations, Democratic and Republican. <br/>At the same time, congressional Republicans and centrist Democrats need to put Obama’s senior <br/>AND<br/>with hedged and narrow legal rationales from which they can later walk away. <br/>Consider, for instance, the diffidence of Harold Koh, the legal adviser of <br/>AND<br/>, and other agencies directly conducting these activities as somewhat less than reassuring. <br/>In fact, the administration’s top lawyers should offer a public legal defense of its <br/>AND<br/>S. government and will be publicly defended as such by their superiors. <br/>Even as the Obama administration increasingly relies on Predator strikes for its counterterrorism strategy, <br/>AND<br/>at stigmatizing the use of Predators as both illegal and a coward’s weapon. <br/>Stigmatizing the technology and the practice of targeted killing is only half of it, <br/>AND<br/>—either as law enforcement or as armed conflict conducted by uniformed military. <br/>The Obama administration is complacent about this emerging “international soft law” campaign. <br/>AND<br/>spun by the interlocking international “soft law” community and global media. <br/>It’s a mistake to remain oblivious to either the sense or the sensibility.
