Third-party willingness, in turn, depends upon two conditions: (1) legal principles must be clearly defined, making violations easily identifiable and (2) third parties must regard the legal obligation as highly salient.<br/>First, scholars have long recognized that there is significant variation in the precision and <br/>AND<br/>punishment and sanctions for violating the law when legal obligations are clearly defined.<br/>While some bodies of law are imprecise, international humanitarian law establishes a comprehensive code of conduct regarding the intentional targeting of noncombatants during war (e.g., Murphy 2006; Shaw 2003). Starting with the 1899 and 1907 Hague Conventions and continuing through the 1949 Geneva Convention (Protocol IV), the law clearly prohibits the intentional targeting of noncombatants in war.<br/>This clarity allows international humanitarian law to serve as a "bright line" that <br/>AND<br/>law and greater punishment for violating it when the clarity condition is met.</p><h4 id="HRejectingtheaffforeclosesanepistemicmiddlegroundthatallowsdesigningeffectivepoliticalresponses" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Rejecting the aff forecloses an epistemic middle ground that allows designing effective political responses</span></h4><p>Rudra <strong>Sil</strong>, assistant professor of Political Science at University of Pennsylvania.

And many weapons systems would be left without either fuel or electric power", said Senator Grassley.¶ "So in a few short hours or days, the mightiest military in the world would be left scrambling to maintain base functions", he said.¶ We contacted the Pentagon and officials confirmed the threat of a cyber attack is something very real.¶ Top national security officials—including the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the Director of the National Security Agency, the Secretary of Defense, and the CIA Director— have said, "preventing a cyber attack and improving the nation’s electric grids is among the most urgent priorities of our country" (source: Congressional Record).¶ So how serious is the Pentagon taking all this?¶ Enough to start, or end a war over it, for sure (see video: Pentagon declares war on cyber attacks <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kVQrp_D0kY26feature=relmfu  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kVQrp_D0kY26feature=relmfu%27" tppabs="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kVQrp_D0kY26feature=relmfu"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kVQrp_D0kY26feature=relmfu</span></a></span> ).¶ A cyber attack today against the US could very well be seen as an "Act of War" and could be met with a "full scale" US military response.¶ That could include the use of "nuclear weapons", if authorized by the President.</p><h3 id="HPtx-1" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Ptx</span></h3><h4 id="HUnemploymentpoundstheDA" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Unemployment pounds the DA</span></h4><p>David <strong>Jackson 1/7</strong>, "Obama’s day: Pushing unemployment benefits", 2014, www.usatoday.com/story/theoval/2014/01/07/obama-unemployment-insurance-extension-senate-vote/4352303/<br/>President Obama spends Tuesday on the first political fight of 2014 with congressional Republicans, <br/>AND<br/>the wrong direction," said Sen.

And many weapons systems would be left without either fuel or electric power", said Senator Grassley.¶ "So in a few short hours or days, the mightiest military in the world would be left scrambling to maintain base functions", he said.¶ We contacted the Pentagon and officials confirmed the threat of a cyber attack is something very real.¶ Top national security officials—including the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the Director of the National Security Agency, the Secretary of Defense, and the CIA Director— have said, "preventing a cyber attack and improving the nation’s electric grids is among the most urgent priorities of our country" (source: Congressional Record).¶ So how serious is the Pentagon taking all this?¶ Enough to start, or end a war over it, for sure (see video: Pentagon declares war on cyber attacks <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kVQrp_D0kY26feature=relmfu  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kVQrp_D0kY26feature=relmfu%27" tppabs="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kVQrp_D0kY26feature=relmfu"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kVQrp_D0kY26feature=relmfu</span></a></span> ).¶ A cyber attack today against the US could very well be seen as an "Act of War" and could be met with a "full scale" US military response.¶ That could include the use of "nuclear weapons", if authorized by the President.</p><h3 id="HK-2" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>K</span></h3><h4 id="HNormsdisad2014-the1ACiskeytosolve" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Norms disad—-the 1AC is key to solve</span></h4><p>Robert <strong>Farley 11</strong>, assistant professor at the Patterson School of Diplomacy and International Commerce at the University of Kentucky, Over the Horizon: U.S. Drone Use Sets Global Precedent, October 12, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/10311/over-the-horizon-u-s-drone-use-sets-global-precedent  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/10311/over-the-horizon-u-s-drone-use-sets-global-precedent%27" tppabs="http://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/10311/over-the-horizon-u-s-drone-use-sets-global-precedent"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/10311/over-the-horizon-u-s-drone-use-sets-global-precedent</span></a></span><br/>What is undeniable, however, is that we face a drone race, which <br/>AND<br/>policymakers should perhaps devote a touch more attention to the precedent they’re setting.</p><h4 id="HNopriorquestions-2" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>No prior questions</span></h4><p><strong>Owen 2</strong> ~David Owen, Reader of Political Theory at the Univ. of Southampton, &nbsp;Millennium Vol 31 No 3 2002 p. 655-7~<br/>Commenting on the ’philosophical turn’ in IR, Wæver remarks that ’~a~ <br/>AND<br/>the first and second dangers, and so a potentially vicious circle arises.</p><h4 id="HThatsolvesbest2014-theplanprovidesanewavenueforpromotingskepticismandoppositiontoexecutivetargetedkilling" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>That solves best—-the plan provides a new avenue for promoting skepticism and opposition to executive targeted killing</span></h4><p>Colm <strong>O’Cinneide 8</strong>, Senior Lecturer in Law at University College London, "Strapped to the Mast: The Siren Song of Dreadful Necessity, the United Kingdom Human Rights Act and the Terrorist Threat," Ch 15 in Fresh Perspectives on the ’War on Terror,’ ed.

And many weapons systems would be left without either fuel or electric power”, said Senator Grassley.¶ “So in a few short hours or days, the mightiest military in the world would be left scrambling to maintain base functions”, he said.¶ We contacted the Pentagon and officials confirmed the threat of a cyber attack is something very real.¶ Top national security officials—including the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the Director of the National Security Agency, the Secretary of Defense, and the CIA Director— have said, “preventing a cyber attack and improving the nation’s electric grids is among the most urgent priorities of our country” (source: Congressional Record).¶ So how serious is the Pentagon taking all this?¶ Enough to start, or end a war over it, for sure (see video: Pentagon declares war on cyber attacks <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kVQrp_D0kYandfeature=relmfu  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kVQrp_D0kYandfeature=relmfu%27" tppabs="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kVQrp_D0kYandfeature=relmfu"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kVQrp_D0kYandfeature=relmfu</span></a></span> ).¶ A cyber attack today against the US could very well be seen as an “Act of War” and could be met with a “full scale” US military response.¶ That could include the use of “nuclear weapons”, if authorized by the President.<br/>Conditionality is illegitimate – the neg should get one dispositional option – <br/>a) Strategy skew – deters aff offense against either world which tilts the playing field and causes flawed policy analysis<br/>b) Argument responsibility – encourages tech over substance by removing the strategic costs of bad arguments<br/>Perm---do bvoth</p></div></div></td><td>3/28/14</td></tr><tr><td style="width:100%; word-break:break-all; word-break:break-word;"><div><p><input onclick="saveEntry(38)" src="../../xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" tppabs="http://opencaselist13.paperlessdebate.com/xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" style="float:right;" title="Save" type="image" value="Save"></input>

And many weapons systems would be left without either fuel or electric power", said Senator Grassley.¶ "So in a few short hours or days, the mightiest military in the world would be left scrambling to maintain base functions", he said.¶ We contacted the Pentagon and officials confirmed the threat of a cyber attack is something very real.¶ Top national security officials—including the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the Director of the National Security Agency, the Secretary of Defense, and the CIA Director— have said, "preventing a cyber attack and improving the nation’s electric grids is among the most urgent priorities of our country" (source: Congressional Record).¶ So how serious is the Pentagon taking all this?¶ Enough to start, or end a war over it, for sure (see video: Pentagon declares war on cyber attacks <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kVQrp_D0kY26feature=relmfu  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kVQrp_D0kY26feature=relmfu%27" tppabs="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kVQrp_D0kY26feature=relmfu"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kVQrp_D0kY26feature=relmfu</span></a></span> ).¶ A cyber attack today against the US could very well be seen as an "Act of War" and could be met with a "full scale" US military response.¶ That could include the use of "nuclear weapons", if authorized by the President.</p><h3 id="HTerror" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Terror</span></h3><h4 id="HSignaturestrikesfail" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Signature strikes fail</span></h4><p>Michael J <strong>Boyle 13</strong>, Assistant Professor of Political Science at La Salle University, former Lecturer in International Relations and Research Fellow at the Centre for the Study of Terrorism and Political Violence at the University of St Andrews, PhD from Cambridge University, January 2013, "The costs and consequences of drone warfare," International Affairs 89: 1 (2013) 1–29, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/public/International20Affairs/2013/89_1/89_1Boyle.pdf  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/public/International20Affairs/2013/89_1/89_1Boyle.pdf%27" tppabs="http://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/public/International20Affairs/2013/89_1/89_1Boyle.pdf"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/public/International20Affairs/2013/89_1/89_1Boyle.pdf</span></a></span><br/>The second major claim for the effectiveness of drone strikes is based on their ability <br/>AND<br/>Qaeda and strength -

Other reports showed home prices climbed at the fastest pace in more than seven years and manufacturing was in a sustained expansion. <br/>The biggest employment gain in eight years, the rebound in housing and record stock values are boosting household wealth, which will help support spending in the new year. Companies from Ford Motor Co. (F) to Apple Inc. (AAPL) are pledging to expand operations in the U.S. as demand improves, a sign the world’s biggest economy will strengthen in 2014. <br/>"We’re ending 2013 with good momentum," said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Pierpont Securities LLC in Stamford, Connecticut, and the second-best forecaster of consumer confidence over the past two years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. "We’ve seen progress in the labor market. The rise in home values along with the run-up in equity prices is a big element of why people are feeling better." <br/>U.S. stocks rose, with the Standard 26 Poor’s 500 Index poised for its biggest annual advance since 1997, as data showed an improving economy. The S26P 500 climbed 0.3 percent to 1,846.72 at 12:13 p.m. in New York. <br/>Home Values<br/>Another report today showed home prices in 20 cities rose in October from a year ago by the most since February 2006, signaling the real-estate rebound will keep bolstering household wealth. The S26P/Case-Shiller index of property prices climbed 13.6 percent from October 2012 after a 13.3 percent increase in the year ended in September. <br/>A dwindling inventory of foreclosed properties has helped restrict the supply of homes for sale, pushing up prices even as higher mortgage rate cool demand. The real-estate market will probably get its next boost from gains in employment. <br/>"There’s certainly room for home prices to continue rising in the coming year," said Dana Saporta, an economist at Credit Suisse in New York, who projected a 13.7 percent advance in prices in the year ended in October. "As home prices continue to rise, more and more homeowners who are underwater on their mortgages will see their financial situations improving. Just getting out of that underwater position should be a big help to the economy." <br/>Survey results<br/>The median projection in a Bloomberg survey of 59 economists called for the consumer confidence index to climb to 76. The Conference Board, a New York-based research group, today also revised up the November reading from a previously reported 70.4. The index averaged 53.7 in the recession that ended in June 2009. <br/>The group’s present conditions barometer increased to 76.2, the highest reading since April 2008. Consumers’ assessments of current labor-market conditions also improved. The share of respondents who said positions were hard to get dropped this month to the lowest level since September 2008. <br/>Payrolls expanded by 203,000 workers in November after a 200,000 gain in October, and the jobless rate fell to a five-year low of 7 percent, according to Labor Department data. Employment is forecast to increase about 190,000 this month, which would make 2013 the best year since 2005. <br/>The improvement in the economy and labor market helps explain why the Federal Reserve on Dec. 18 decided it will trim monthly bond purchases to 2475 billion from 2485 billion starting in January. <br/>Expectations Brighten<br/>The Conference Board’s gauge of consumer expectations for the next six months jumped to 79.4, the highest since September, from 71.1 a month earlier. The proportion of Americans who said jobs would become more plentiful in the next six months rose to a four-month high. <br/>"Despite the many challenges throughout 2013, consumers are in better spirits today than when the year began," Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at the Conference Board, said in a statement. <br/>The gain tracked advances in other confidence measures. The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort (COMFCOMF) Index jumped to a four-month high for the week ended Dec. 22. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan index climbed in December to a five-month high. <br/>Automakers are among companies benefiting from growing confidence. Auto sales advanced to a 16.3 million annualized rate in November, the highest since May 2007, according to data from Ward’s Automotive Group. <br/>Adding Jobs<br/>Dearborn, Michigan-based Ford said this month it plans to add 5,000 jobs in the U.S. as it introduces 16 new vehicles in 2014. <br/>"We also expect manufacturing, engineering and spending related costs in North America to increase next year due to the 2014 launches as well as for products and capacity actions that will be launched in later periods," Chief Financial Officer Robert L. Shanks said in a Dec. 18 guidance call. He said the company "is, has been, and continues to be in growth mode." <br/>Cupertino, California-based Apple started taking orders this month for the new Mac Pro personal computer, which is being built in Texas with components made domestically as part of Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook’s 24100 million Made-in-the-USA push. <br/>Improving sales are prompting factories to boost output, giving the U.S. economy another boost. Business activity expanded in December, capping the strongest three months in more than two years, another report showed today. <br/>Sustained Growth<br/>While the MNI Chicago Report business barometer declined to 59.1 from 63 in November, numbers greater than 50 signal growth. The index averaged 62.7 over the past three months, the highest since the period ended May 2011. <br/>Manufacturing, which makes up about 12 percent of the economy, has been expanding as demand for automobiles, construction materials and appliances keep factory assembly lines humming. A pickup in business investment and economic improvement overseas would help sustain gains and support growth into the new year.<br/>"Some of the missing pieces for a stronger economic recovery are falling into place," said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody’s Analytics Inc. in West Chester, Pennsylvania. "The consumer’s still going to have to do some of the heavy lifting, particularly early on in the year until the housing cycle kicks in and business investment ramps up."<br/>Won’t pass until after election year<br/>Adam O’Neal 12-23, December 23rd, 2013, "Immigration reform in 2014?
