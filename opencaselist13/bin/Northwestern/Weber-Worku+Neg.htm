They made the following predictions: <br/>"we predict, on the basis of mid-range climate-warming scenarios for 2050, that 15â€"37 of species in our sample of regions and taxa will be â€˜committed to extinctionâ€™.<br/>Subsequently, three communications appeared in Nature in July 2004. Two raised technical problems, including one by the eminent ecologist Joan Roughgarden. Opinions raged from "Dangers of Crying Wolf over Risk of Extinctions" concerned with damage to conservationism by alarmism, through poorly written press releases by the scientists themselves, and Extinction risk ~press~ coverage is worth the inaccuracies stating "we believe the benefits of the wide release greatly outweighed the negative effects of errors in reporting".<br/>Among those believing gross scientific inaccuracies are not justified, and such attitudes diminish the <br/>AND<br/>to model validations in the Thomas paper, and the field in general: <br/>Of the modeling papers we have reviewed, only a few were validated. Commonly<br/>AND<br/>kind of analysis the unvalidated assumptions of models would most likely be ignored.<br/>The paper observed that few mass extinctions have been seen over recent rapid climate changes, suggesting something must be wrong with the models to get such high rates of extinctions. They speculated that species may survive in refugia, suitable habitats below the spatial scale of the models.<br/>Another example of an unvalidated assumptions that could bias results in the direction of extinctions, was described in chapter 7 of my book Niche Modeling.<br/>When climate change shifts a species’ niche over a landscape (dashed to solid circle<br/>AND<br/>in many groups. Consequently, the methodology was inherently biased towards extinctions.<br/>One of the many errors in this work was a failure to evaluate the impact of such assumptions.<br/>The prevailing view now, according to Stephen Williams, coauthor of the Thomas paper and Director for the Center for Tropical Biodiversity and Climate Change, and author of such classics as "Climate change in Australian tropical rainforests: an impending environmental catastrophe", may be here.<br/>Many unknowns remain in projecting extinctions, and the values provided in Thomas et al. (2004) should not be taken as precise predictions. … Despite these uncertainties, Thomas et al. (2004) believe that the consistent overall conclusions across analyses establish that anthropogenic climate warming at least ranks alongside other recognized threats to global biodiversity. <br/>So how precise are the figures? Williams suggests we should just trust the beliefs of Thomas et al. — an approach referred to disparagingly in the forecasting literature as a judgmental forecast rather than a scientific forecast (Green 26 Armstrong 2007). These simple models gloss over numerous problems in validating extinction models, including the propensity of so-called extinct species quite often reappear. Usually they are small, hard to find and no-one is really looking for them.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HHistoricaldata2014-CO2concentrations18timeshigherthancurrentlevelsdidn2019tcausemassextinctions" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Historical data—-CO2 concentrations 18 times higher than current levels didn’t cause mass extinctions</span></h4><p>Kathy J. <strong>Willis et al 10</strong>, Professor of Long-Term Ecology at the University of Oxford; Keith D.

Or does the West’s failure to win the war of ideas mean that radical Islamism still represent a threat?<br/>"There is a newfound conviction that protests, strikes and civil action are more effective than fighting and force," said Marwan Shehadeh, a Jordan-based expert on radical Islamist groups and ideology.<br/>The Muslim Brotherhood, which long ago disavowed violence, has participated in the political <br/>AND<br/>receptive by repression and the failure of the political process to produce change.<br/>The Arab Spring has vindicated the conviction "that Arab dictatorships were inherently unstable and that democracy has more appeal to the people of the Middle East than jihadist violence and ideology," writes Carl Gershman, President of the National Endowment for Democracy, the Washington-based democracy assistance group.<br/>Even more than the killing of Osama bin Laden, the revolts in Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Syria, Yemen, and Bahrain "have not only shaken the very foundation of the regional authoritarian order but threatened to unravel our narrative about terrorism," writes Fawaz Gerges, author of The Far Enemy: Why Jihad Went Global and Journey of the Jihadist: Inside Muslim Militancy:<br/>As the uprisings gained momentum, Al Qaeda was notably absent. The Arab Spring <br/>AND<br/>neither burned American and Western flags nor blamed the West for their predicament.<br/>The region’s pro-democracy surge killed the myth of Arab exceptionalism, according to the FT’s Gideon Rachman, but also demonstrated the need for political reform to be home-grown and locally-owned:<br/>The "Arab spring" has provided support for the neoconservative notion that the Arab world could not – and should not – be exempt from a global trend towards democracy. But it has also illustrated that durable change is much more likely to come from within, than via US intervention.<br/>Recent events confirm that Arab citizens have been moved to protest largely by socio-economic grievances and demands that radical Islamists cannot begin to address: people want jobs not jihad, democracy not dogma.<br/>"The Arab Spring and the clamor for democracy across the world shows how redundant al-Qaida has become – it has lost all relevance; its vision of some pan-Islamic Caliphate is not what people want," according to Anthony Tucker-Jones, author of The Rise of Militant Islam. "Ultimately, religious dogma is no substitute for social aspiration and economic achievement."<br/>The region’s pro-democracy movements are "the strongest answer" to the fanaticism that motivated the 9/11 attacks a decade ago, the European Union said today.<br/>"Ten years on, the people in the streets of Tunis, Cairo, Benghazi and across the Arab world have sent a strong signal for freedom and democracy," said EU president Herman Van Rompuy and European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso in a joint statement. "This is the strongest answer to the fatuous hate and blind fanaticism of the 9/11 crimes.<br/>"The Sept. 11 attacks were in part inspired by a radical ideology and belief that the fundamental problems plaguing Arab and Muslim people could be resolved by attacking foreign powers, those propping up dictators, promoting Western culture, oppressing Islam and corrupting civilization," according to Michael Slackman and Mona El-Naggar:<br/>The Arab Spring has turned that formula inside out, negating premises fundamental to a world that bore and nurtured Osama bin Laden. Arab majorities, still harboring resentment toward Western policies, are first looking inward to promote change, blaming their own leaders for decades of political, economic and cultural decline.

Indeed, this assertion is used by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and other organizations as one of the primary justifications for imposing restrictions on human emissions of greenhouse gases.<br/>But there is an internal contradiction in the IPCC’s own claims. Indeed, the same highly influential report from the IPCC claims both that poor countries will fare terribly and that they will be much better off than they are today. So, which is it?<br/>The apparent contradiction arises because of inconsistencies in the way the IPCC assesses impacts. The process begins with various scenarios of future emissions. These scenarios are themselves predicated on certain assumptions about the rate of economic growth and related technological change.<br/>Under the IPCC’s highest growth scenario, by 2100 GDP per capita in poor countries <br/>AND<br/>sorts of scare stories about the impact of climate change on the poor. <br/>Under this highest growth scenario (known as A1FI), the poor will logically have adopted, adapted and innovated all manner of new technololgies, making them far better able to adapt to the future climate. But these improvements in adaptive capacity are virtually ignored by most global warming impact assessments. Consequently, the IPCC’s "impacts" assessments systematically overestimate the negative impact of global warming, while underestimating the positive impact.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HThiseliminatesnegativeimpactsofwarming" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>This eliminates negative impacts of warming</span></h4><p>Indur M. <strong>Goklany 11</strong>, science and technology policy analyst and Assistant Director of Programs, Science and Technology Policy for the United States Department of the Interior; was associated with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change off and on for 20 years as an author, expert reviewer and U.S. delegate, December 2011, "Misled on Climate Change: How the UN IPCC (and others) Exaggerate the Impacts of Global Warming," online: <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://goklany.org/library/Reason20CC20and20Development202011.pdf  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://goklany.org/library/Reason20CC20and20Development202011.pdf%27" tppabs="http://goklany.org/library/Reason20CC20and20Development202011.pdf"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://goklany.org/library/Reason20CC20and20Development202011.pdf</span></a></span><br/>These figures also indicate that the compound effect of economic development and technological change can <br/>AND<br/>.

It is a shame, a disgrace and a profanity, which is neither expected of any head of state and particularly from a Nobel laureate president who in 2009 in Cairo attempted to project himself as a redeemer saying: "Israelis must acknowledge that just as Israel’s right to exist cannot be denied, neither can Palestine’s." <br/>And if Cairo speech wasn’t enough Obama even in the United Nations on September 23, 2010 said: "When we come back here next year, we can have an agreement that will lead to a new member of the United Nations — an independent, sovereign state of Palestine, living in peace with Israel". <br/>Real face <br/>In sharp contradiction to whatever he said earlier Obama displayed the real face of the United States when he, in no uncertain terms, threatened Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas that he would use his veto power to thwart Palestinians’ move to seek UN recognition. It was outrageous and enraged every one in Middle East, shocked the world and the broken shards of the kaleidoscope depicted incoherence of American policies in Middle East. <br/>The solidarity which Obama showed in Cairo University has now become a sham. Obama has proved that in his support for Israel and in allowing himself to become the mouthpiece of an unsavoury Jewish client he differs little from his peers. <br/>This has certainly compromised America’s position and influence in the region beyond any short term salvage. <br/>Devoid of logic and diplomatic finesse such US stand is despicable. Washington has actually been the biggest block on the way to any solution to Palestinian issue. In following a policy of insularity from the realities of the world Obama has only contributed in adding to the problem and in creating a deadlock. <br/>Obama’s abject diplomacy and his treachery against the Palestinians and Arabs have made the United <br/>AND<br/>the American saga of hubris, ineptitude, intractable ignorance and blemished thinking. <br/>Polarised <br/>He has been indeed blemished in his thinking that he could reach out to the Arabs only by means of his rhetoric and doing nothing to alleviate their status in global order. And equally so is his belief that he can get himself re-elected for the second term as the president. <br/>Analysts and political observers, not just in the United States, are clearly polarised <br/>AND<br/>have been disasters. He has failed in upholding justice across the world. <br/>Matt Strawn chairman of Iowa’s Republican Party has recently said: "On behalf of <br/>AND<br/>the Caucus process a reflection of the very best of our representative democracy". <br/>Perceptions <br/>But the central question is will the departure of Obama and Democratic rule change the US foreign policy, especially its policies in Middle East. Such a possibility appears rather remote as irrespective of who walks into the Oval Office and which party rules over the US for next four years, America will remain steadfastly supportive of Israel because of its domestic political compulsions. And these political expediencies will further debilitate US influence in Middle East. <br/>Time has changed and so has the world. Perceptions about American stand in the region have now become clearer than ever. And unless the mandarins in Washington realises the realities of the changed time the US shall soon become only a marginalised player in Middle East with little or no influence to wield.</p><p>~in AT US led peace process~</p><h4 id="HBlindsupportforIsraelcrushestheUS2019abilitytoplayapositiveroleintheregion" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Blind support for Israel crushes the US’ ability to play a positive role in the region</span></h4><p><strong>Khouri 11</strong>—Director of the Issam Fares Institute of Public Policy and International Affairs at the American University of Beirut (Rami, Power and Confusion in the United States and Palestine, 10/10/11, www.middle-east-online.com/english/?id=48467)</p><p>The most dramatic window into America’s confusion, contradictions, and degraded credibility is its <br/>AND<br/>we are entering, the Palestinians are acting, and Washington is reacting.<br/>This is just one example of how the strongest power in the world also may <br/>AND<br/>be highlighted by the Palestinian move at the UN in the months ahead.<br/>The Palestinian quest for UN recognition is now widely debated across the United States, <br/>AND<br/>, rather than American Zionism, define the ground rules of diplomatic engagement.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HLackofaccountabilityforpastpracticesgutscred" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Lack of accountability for past practices guts cred</span></h4><p>Thomas <strong>Hilde 09</strong>, professor at the University of Maryland School of Public Policy, "Beyond Guantanamo.

For Washington is setting a precedent whereby states can send drones, often over sovereign borders, to kill foreigners or their own citizens, who are deemed threats. <br/>Other states may also follow Washington’s example and develop their own criteria to define imminent threats and use drones to counter them. <br/>Washington will find it increasingly difficult to protest other nations’ targeted killing programs — particularly when the United States has helped define this lethal practice. U.S. opposition will prove especially difficult when other states justify targeted killings as a matter of domestic affairs. <br/>Should enough states follow the U.S. example, the practice of preemptively targeting and killing suspected threats may develop into customary international law. <br/>Such a norm, however, which requires consistent state practice arising out of a sense of legal obligation, now looks unlikely. While targeted killing policies are arguably executed by states citing a legal obligation to protect themselves from imminent threats, widespread state practice is still uncommon. <br/>But international law does not forbid drones. And given the lack of an international regime to control drones, state and non-state actors are free to determine their future use. <br/>This lack of international consensus about how to control drones stems from a serious contradiction in incentives. Though drones pose grave challenges, they also offer states lethal and non-lethal capabilities that are of great appeal. Because the potential for drone technology is virtually limitless, states are now unwilling to control how drones evolve.</p><h4 id="HNoriskofdronewars" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>No risk of drone wars</span></h4><p>Joseph <strong>Singh 12</strong>, researcher at the Center for a New American Security, 8/13/12, and#34;Betting Against a Drone Arms Race,and#34; <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://nation.time.com/2012/08/13/betting-against-a-drone-arms-race/~~23ixzz2eSvaZnfQ  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://nation.time.com/2012/08/13/betting-against-a-drone-arms-race/~~23ixzz2eSvaZnfQ%27" tppabs="http://nation.time.com/2012/08/13/betting-against-a-drone-arms-race/~~23ixzz2eSvaZnfQ"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://nation.time.com/2012/08/13/betting-against-a-drone-arms-race/~~23ixzz2eSvaZnfQ</span></a></span><br/>In short, the doomsday drone scenario Ignatieff and Sharkey predict results from an excessive focus on rapidly-evolving military technology. <br/>Instead, we must return to what we know about state behavior in an anarchistic international order. Nations will confront the same principles of deterrence, for example, when deciding to launch a targeted killing operation regardless of whether they conduct it through a drone or a covert amphibious assault team. <br/>Drones may make waging war more domestically palatable, but they don’t change the very serious risks of retaliation for an attacking state. Any state otherwise deterred from using force abroad will not significantly increase its power projection on account of acquiring drones. <br/>What’s more, the very states whose use of drones could threaten U.S. security – countries like China – are not democratic, which means that the possible political ramifications of the low risk of casualties resulting from drone use are irrelevant. For all their military benefits, putting drones into play requires an ability to meet the political and security risks associated with their use. <br/>Despite these realities, there remain a host of defensible arguments one could employ to discredit the Obama drone strategy. The legal justification for targeted killings in areas not internationally recognized as war zones is uncertain at best. <br/>Further, the short-term gains yielded by targeted killing operations in Pakistan, Somalia and Yemen, while debilitating to Al Qaeda leadership in the short-term, may serve to destroy already tenacious bilateral relations in the region and radicalize local populations. <br/>Yet, the past decade’s experience with drones bears no evidence of impending instability in the global strategic landscape. Conflict may not be any less likely in the era of drones, but the nature of 21st Century warfare remains fundamentally unaltered despite their arrival in large numbers.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HNoIndo-Pakconflict-energycooperationandnewgovernance" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>No Indo-Pak conflict- energy cooperation and new governance</span></h4><p>Sam <strong>Tranum 6/25</strong>/13, MA from the University of Chicago in IR and a journalist covering energy and politics in South Asia, 6/25/13, and#34;India-Pakistan Energy Cooperation Could Get Boost Under Sharif,and#34; World Politics Review, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/13049/india-pakistan-energy-cooperation-could-get-boost-under-sharif  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/13049/india-pakistan-energy-cooperation-could-get-boost-under-sharif%27" tppabs="http://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/13049/india-pakistan-energy-cooperation-could-get-boost-under-sharif"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/13049/india-pakistan-energy-cooperation-could-get-boost-under-sharif</span></a></span><br/>Pakistani and Indian officials met earlier this month to discuss cross-border energy cooperation<br/>AND<br/>bit more might help to normalize relations and make future conflicts less likely.</p></div></div></td><td>9/21/13</td></tr><tr><td style="width:100%; word-break:break-all; word-break:break-word;"><div><p><input onclick="saveEntry(6)" src="../../xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" tppabs="http://opencaselist13.paperlessdebate.com/xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" style="float:right;" title="Save" type="image" value="Save"></input>

More than that, though, the drone strikes need an aggressive defense against increasingly vocal critics who are moving to create around drone warfare a narrative of American wickedness and cowardice and of CIA perfidy. <br/>Here the administration has dropped the ball. It has so far failed to provide a robust affirmation of the propositions that underwrite Predator drone warfare. Namely: <br/>n Targeted killings of terrorists, including by Predators and even when the targets are American citizens, are a lawful practice; <br/>n Use of force is justified against terrorists anywhere they set up safe havens, including in states that cannot or will not prevent them; <br/>n These operations may be covert—and they are as justifiable when the CIA is tasked to carry them out secretly as when the military does so in open armed conflict. <br/>n All of the above fall within the traditional American legal view of “self-defense” in international law, and “vital national security interests” in U.S. domestic law. <br/>There are good reasons for Republicans and centrist Democrats to make common cause in defending <br/>AND<br/>view of domestic and international law for future administrations, Democratic and Republican. <br/>At the same time, congressional Republicans and centrist Democrats need to put Obama’s senior <br/>AND<br/>with hedged and narrow legal rationales from which they can later walk away. <br/>Consider, for instance, the diffidence of Harold Koh, the legal adviser of <br/>AND<br/>, and other agencies directly conducting these activities as somewhat less than reassuring. <br/>In fact, the administration’s top lawyers should offer a public legal defense of its <br/>AND<br/>S. government and will be publicly defended as such by their superiors. <br/>Even as the Obama administration increasingly relies on Predator strikes for its counterterrorism strategy, <br/>AND<br/>at stigmatizing the use of Predators as both illegal and a coward’s weapon. <br/>Stigmatizing the technology and the practice of targeted killing is only half of it, <br/>AND<br/>—either as law enforcement or as armed conflict conducted by uniformed military. <br/>The Obama administration is complacent about this emerging “international soft law” campaign. <br/>AND<br/>spun by the interlocking international “soft law” community and global media. <br/>It’s a mistake to remain oblivious to either the sense or the sensibility. Outside <br/>AND<br/>United States, or abroad in Europe, or at the United Nations?<br/>The Obama administration assumes that it uniquely sets the terms of legal legitimacy and has <br/>AND<br/>Here’s the thumbnail version of drone warfare, as portrayed in the media.</p></div></div></td><td>9/21/13</td></tr><tr><td style="width:100%; word-break:break-all; word-break:break-word;"><div><p><input onclick="saveEntry(32)" src="../../xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" tppabs="http://opencaselist13.paperlessdebate.com/xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" style="float:right;" title="Save" type="image" value="Save"></input>

In all these settings the tragic human suffering produced by such plunder is simply ignored.

What the drone adds to that intelligence might be considerable, through its surveillance capabilities — but much of the drone’s contribution will be tactical, providing intelligence that assists in the planning and execution of the strike itself, in order to pick the moment when there might be the fewest civilian casualties.<br/>Nonetheless, in conjunction with high-quality intelligence, drone warfare offers an unparalleled means to strike directly at terrorist organizations without needing a conventional or counterinsurgency approach to reach terrorist groups in their safe havens. It offers an offensive capability, rather than simply defensive measures, such as homeland security alone. Drone warfare offers a raiding strategy directly against the terrorists and their leadership.<br/>If one believes, as many of the critics of drone warfare do, that <br/>AND<br/>common enemies are examples of the methods that are just of military nature.<br/>Drone warfare today is integrated with a much larger strategic counterterrorism target — one in <br/>AND<br/>acknowledged in communications, have a significant impact on planning and organizational effectiveness.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HConstrainingtargetedkilling2019sroleinthewaronterrorcausesextinction" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Constraining targeted killing’s role in the war on terror causes extinction</span></h4><p>Louis Rene <strong>Beres 11</strong>, Professor of Political Science and International Law at Purdue, 2011, and#34;After Osama bin Laden: Assassination, Terrorism, War, and International Law,and#34; Case Western Reserve Journal of International Law, 44 Case W.

J Int'l L. 330<br/>To move toward a new paradigm I suggest one needs to build a case against <br/>AND<br/>as the protection of the environment, peace, and freedom from terror.<br/>As a starting point for such a case, one should note that sovereignty was <br/>AND<br/>that of the body politic and creates insurmountable complications for international law. n44<br/>Stephen Krasner has demonstrated that throughout history the norm of sovereignty has been appealed to by rulers and statesmen when it was advantageous to them in holding onto their positions of power and authority. When it was &nbsp;*341 &nbsp;politically expedient to ignore the Westphalian norm, however Krasner finds that leaders were, by and large, weakly constrained by the norms of sovereignty.<br/>For example, Krasner discusses many interventions by the Western powers into the internal affairs <br/>AND<br/>a semi-autonomous Bulgaria, all previously parts of the Ottoman Empire.<br/>Krasner also highlights the ways Westphalian sovereignty has been sacrificed to both human rights and security concerns. British warships forcibly entered Brazilian ports in 1850 and destroyed those ships suspected of engaging in the slave trade. The pretext was that the Brazilian government was not adequately enforcing its own ban on slavery, which Brazil promised to Britain in an 1826 treaty in exchange for the latter's recognition of Brazilian statehood.<br/>Twentieth-century examples of this phenomenon abound. In the first quarter of the century, U.S. marines were deployed to Cuba, Haiti, Honduras, and the Dominican Republic, with each nation being subject to either a U.S. governor or a U.S.-sponsored regime change in the aftermath.<br/>From his survey of the concept's history, Krasner concludes by characterizing the norm of sovereignty as "organized hypocrisy," in that it is universally recognized but at the same time widely violated. n45 Many may quarrel with Krasner's choice of words, but he provides strong evidence that sovereignty was often violated for good and bad causes and thus does not have the inviolate standing those who favor it claim.<br/>The second key to understanding sovereignty as citizenship is the recognition that no right, <br/>AND<br/>so intended. n47 It should not be automatically heeded in either case.<br/>2. Sovereignty as Conditional<br/>There is growing transnational consensus that sovereignty ought to be conditional. In the wake <br/>AND<br/>Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, in the mid-1960s. n49<br/> <br/>The CP establishes an international doctrine of Responsibility to Counter Terrorism---that’s key to global normative dialogues which make sovereignty reflect positive obligations of states---and key to global CT <br/>Amitai Etzioni 13, professor of international relations at George Washington University, Summer 2013, “Article: A Liberal Communitarian Paradigm for Counterterrorism,” Stanford Journal of International Law, 49 Stan.

And if states fail, they should face corrective measures.<br/>This is the case that ought to be made to change the norms, however <br/>AND<br/>all steps that relegitimate the concept of sovereignty instead of scaling it back.<br/>In short, there are numerous compelling and persuasive reasons not to view counterterrorism campaigns as wars and not to treat terrorists as soldiers. The responsibility of nations to prevent terrorists from using their land and assets is one that follows from the recognition that the world of national borders is losing its empirical footing and normative power.<br/>Communitarians stress that individuals do not merely have rights but also responsibilities, to each <br/>AND<br/>the common good.

Although the controversial ceasefire accords Islamabad earlier negotiated with tribal leaders have formally collapsed, the Pakistani Army has repeatedly postponed announced plans to occupy North Waziristan, which is where the Afghan insurgents and the foreign fighters supporting them and al-Qaeda are concentrated. <br/>Such a move that would meet fierce resistance from the region’s population, which has traditionally enjoyed extensive autonomy. The recent massive floods have also forced the military to divert its assets to humanitarian purposes, especially helping the more than ten million displaced people driven from their homes. <br/>But the main reason for their not attacking the Afghan Taliban or its foreign allies based in Pakistan’s tribal areas is that doing so would result in their joining the Pakistani Taliban in its vicious fight with the Islamabad government. <br/>Yet, sending in U.S. combat troops on recurring raids or a protracted occupation of Pakistani territory would provoke widespread outrage in Pakistan and perhaps in other countries as well since the UN Security Council mandate for the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan only authorizes military operations in Pakistan. <br/>On the one known occasion when U.S. Special Forces actually conducted a <br/>AND<br/>U.S. forces attempting to cross the Afghan-Pakistan border. <br/>On several occasions since then, Pakistani troops and militia have fired at what they believed to be American helicopters flying from Afghanistan to deploy Special Forces on their territory, though there is no conclusive evidence that the U.S. military has ever attempted another large-scale commando raid in Pakistan after the September 2008 incident. <br/>Further large-scale U.S. military operations into Pakistan could easily rally popular support behind the Taliban and al-Qaeda. It might even precipitate the collapse of the Islambad government and its replacement by a regime in nuclear-armed Pakistan that is less friendly to Washington. <br/>Given these alternatives, continuing the drone strikes appears to be the best of the limited options available to deal with a core problem, giving sanctuary to terrorists striking US and coalition forces in Afghanistan and beyond.</p><p>Aggressive targeted killing policy’s key to stability in Yemen<br/>Alan W.

The diffuse, decentralized <br/>AND<br/>, and other countries has changed the nature of the war on terror.<br/>This strategy is not without controversy. The Obama administration’s heavy use of unmanned drones <br/>AND<br/>use of drones exacerbates, rather than solves, the problem of terrorism.<br/>The reality is not so bleak: drones are very good at what they do. Unmanned attacks are highly effective when it comes to eliminating specific members of terrorist organizations, disrupting terrorist networks without creating too much collateral damage. Their effectiveness makes drone strikes a vital part of US counterterrorism strategy.<br/>Predator and Reaper drones are not the indiscriminate civilian-killers that some make them <br/>AND<br/>also help to mitigate anti-American sentiment that stems from civilian casualties.</p><p>Shifting to capture missions is impossible-~--every alternative to drones is worse for CT <br/>Daniel Byman 13, Professor in the Security Studies Program at the Edmund A.

The idea that these individuals could be prevented from carrying out further terror attacks by issuing an arrest order to the Pakistani government is tantamount to Israel demanding that the Palestinian Authority hand over all the Palestinians involved in plotting against it (Statman).&nbsp;</p><p>The U.S. won’t implement capture missions as an alternative to drone strikes <br/>Romesh Ratnesar 13, Deputy Editor of Bloomberg-Businessweek, 5/23/13, “Five Reasons Why Drones Are Here to Stay,” <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.businessweek.com/printer/articles/119384-five-reasons-why-drones-are-here-to-stay  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.businessweek.com/printer/articles/119384-five-reasons-why-drones-are-here-to-stay%27" tppabs="http://www.businessweek.com/printer/articles/119384-five-reasons-why-drones-are-here-to-stay"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.businessweek.com/printer/articles/119384-five-reasons-why-drones-are-here-to-stay</span></a></span><br/>3.
