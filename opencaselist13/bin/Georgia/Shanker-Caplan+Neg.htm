Today Russian and U.S. ICBMs are not targeted at any state. High alert status of the Russian and U.S. strategic nuclear forces has not been an obstacle for building a strategic partnership. &nbsp;The issue of the possibility of an “accidental” nuclear war itself is hypothetical. Both states have developed and implemented constructive organizational and technical measures that practically exclude launches resulting from unauthorized action of personnel or terrorists. Nuclear weapons are maintained under very strict system of control that excludes any accidental or unauthorized use and guarantees that these weapons can only be used provided that there is an appropriate authorization by the national leadership. Besides that it should be mentioned that even the Soviet Union and the United States had taken important bilateral steps toward decreasing the risk of accidental nuclear conflict. Direct emergency telephone “red line” has been established between the White House and the Kremlin in 1963. In 1971 the USSR and USA signed the Agreement on Measures to Reduce the Nuclear War Threat. This Agreement established the actions of each side in case of even a hypothetical accidental missile launch and it contains the requirements for the owner of the launched missile to deactivate and eliminate the missile. Both the Soviet Union and &nbsp;the United States have developed proper measures to observe the agreed requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Moar Defense<br/>-- No risk of Russia war<br/>Ball 5 (Desmond, Professor – Strategic Defence Studies Centre at Australian National University, “The Probabilities of ‘On the Beach’ Assessing Armageddon Scenarios in the 21st Century, May, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.manningclark.org.au/papers/se05_ball.html)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.manningclark.org.au/papers/se05_ball.html)%27" tppabs="http://www.manningclark.org.au/papers/se05_ball.html)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.manningclark.org.au/papers/se05_ball.html)</span></a></span></p><p>The prospects of a nuclear war between the US and Russia must now be deemed <br/>AND<br/>buried targets (such as underground command and control centres and leadership bunkers).<br/>-- Common ties, Russian leadership, and defense spending checks<br/>Aron 6 (Leon, Director of Russian Studies – American Enterprise Institute, “The United States and Russia”, 6-29, <br/><span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.aei.org/publications/pubID.24606/pub_detail.asp)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.aei.org/publications/pubID.24606/pub_detail.asp)%27" tppabs="http://www.aei.org/publications/pubID.24606/pub_detail.asp)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.aei.org/publications/pubID.24606/pub_detail.asp)</span></a></span></p><p>Yet the probability of a frontal confrontation and a new Cold War remains very remote <br/>AND<br/>-eleventh of what the U.S. spent ($522 billion).<br/>-- Deterrence checks<br/>Turner 2 (Admiral Stansfield, Former Director – Central Intelligence Agency, Fletcher Forum of World Affairs, Winter / Spring, 26 Fletcher F.

protection and surveillance that produces the most complications for the transatlantic intelligence relationship, but rather America's use of armed drones to kill terrorist suspects away from the battlefield. Incidents such as the recent killing of at least 17 people in Pakistan are therefore only likely to heighten European unease.<br/>In public, European governments have displayed a curiously passive approach to American drone strikes<br/>AND<br/>, however, Europe’s muted stance on drone strikes looks likely to change.<br/>Why? For one thing, many European countries are now trying to acquire armed <br/>AND<br/>and discussions are also likely to start at a pan-European level.<br/>But as Europeans begin to articulate their policy on the use of drones, a <br/>AND<br/>an expanded drone strike campaign. European countries have generally rejected this claim.<br/>However, the changes to American policy that President Obama announced in May could open <br/>AND<br/>associated force could lawfully be killed with a drone strike at any time.<br/>European countries might be more willing to accept an approach based on this kind of “self-defense” idea. However, there remain some big stumbling blocks.<br/>First, a good deal about Obama’s new standards is still unclear. How does he define a “zone of hostilities,” where the new rules will not apply? And what is his understanding of an “imminent” threat? European countries are likely to interpret these key terms in a much narrower way than the United States.<br/>Second, Obama’s new approach only applies as a policy choice. His more expansive legal claims remain in the background so that he is free to return to them if he wishes.<br/>But if the United States is serious about working toward international standards on drone strikes, as Obama and his officials have sometimes suggested, then Europe is the obvious place to start.

In Congress today, Sen. Edward Kennedy supports nearly all the economic dogmas listed above. It is easy to see, therefore, that the coming economic contraction, due in part to a policy of massive credit expansion, will have serious political consequences for the Republican Party (to the benefit of the Democrats). Furthermore, an economic contraction will encourage the formation of anti–capitalist majorities and a turning away from the free market system. The danger here is not merely economic. The political left openly favors the collapse of America's strategic position abroad. The withdrawal of the United States from the Middle East, the Far East and Europe would catastrophically impact an international system that presently allows 6 billion people to live on the earth's surface in relative peace. Should anti–capitalist dogmas overwhelm the global market and trading system that evolved under American leadership, the planet's economy would contract and untold millions would die of starvation. Nationalistic totalitarianism, fueled by a politics of blame, would once again bring war to Asia and Europe. But this time the war would be waged with mass destruction weapons and the United States would be blamed because it is the center of global capitalism. Furthermore, if the anti–capitalist party gains power in Washington, we can expect to see policies of appeasement and unilateral disarmament enacted. American appeasement and disarmament, in this context, would be an admission of guilt before the court of world opinion. Russia and China, above all, would exploit this admission to justify aggressive wars, invasions and mass destruction attacks. A future financial crash, therefore, must be prevented at all costs. But we cannot do this.

From its supposed flashpoint status during the 1990s, the Spratlys have calmed down considerably, and today the status of the islands is 'no longer discussed as a major security concern'.20 To its credit, China has made a concerted effort not to let the South China Sea issue become a major domestic political football (unlike the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands dispute with Japan), nor has it seized or occupied additional islands in the Spratlys since 1995. In particular, in 2002 Beijing and ASEAN agreed to a joint Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, which affirmed the intention of the signatories to peacefully resolve their territorial and jurisdictional disputes, to exercise self-restraint in the South China Sea and to avoid actions that would 'complicate or escalate disputes and affect peace and stability', including refraining from further construction on the presently uninhabited islands. In addition, in March 2005 Beijing also signed bilateral agreements with the Philippines and Vietnam for the joint exploration for oil in areas of overlapping sovereignty claims. (At the same time, estimates of likely oil and gas reserves in the South China Sea have been revised downward considerably, so there may be much less to fight over than originally believed.) This is not to say that the Spratly Islands dispute has been settled once and for all (fishing rights, for example, will continue to be important).

A dangerous period of vulnerability would open for the United States and those nations that depend on U.S. protection while the United States attempted to rectify the problems with its nuclear forces. As it would take more than a decade for the United States to produce new nuclear weapons, ensuing events could preclude a return to anything like the status quo ante.<br/>? The assertive, nuclear-armed great power, and other major adversaries, could be willing to challenge U.S. interests more directly in the expectation that the United States would be less prepared to threaten or deliver a military response that could lead to direct conflict. They will want to keep the United States from reclaiming its earlier power position.<br/>? Allies and partners who have relied upon explicit or implicit assurances of U.S. nuclear protection as a foundation of their security could lose faith in those assur¬ances. They could compensate by accom¬modating U.S. rivals, especially in the short term, or acquiring their own nuclear deter¬rents, which in most cases could be accom¬plished only over the mid- to long term. A more nuclear world would likely ensue over a period of years.<br/>? Important U.S. interests could be com¬promised or abandoned, or a major war could occur as adversaries and/or the United States miscalculate new boundaries of deterrence and provocation. At worst, war could lead to state-on-state employment of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) on a scale far more catastrophic than what nuclear-armed terror¬ists alone could inflict.</p></div></div></td><td>9/23/13</td></tr><tr><td style="width:100%; word-break:break-all; word-break:break-word;"><div><p><input onclick="saveEntry(12)" src="../../xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" tppabs="http://opencaselist13.paperlessdebate.com/xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" style="float:right;" title="Save" type="image" value="Save"></input>

The question-the sole question, in the consent-based international legal system-is whether states have in fact agreed to be bound by the Charter's use-of-force rules. If states had truly intended to make those rules obligatory, they would have made the cost of violation greater than the perceived benefits.<br/>They have not. The Charter's use-of-force rules have been widely and regularly disregarded.

Within this field of human endeavor, the most successful armies are those led by decisive commanders who visualize the operational environment and make rapid, sound decisions. Combat leadership involves the motivation of others to risk their lives, and only the most decisive and confident leaders can inspire this kind of self-sacrifice.¶ Leadership is the multiplying and unifying element of combat power. Confident, competent, and informed leadership intensifies the effectiveness of all other elements of combat power by formulating sound operational ideas and assuring discipline and motivation in the force . . . Leadership in today’s operational environment is often the difference between success and failure.¶ Dept. of the Army, Field Manual 3-0, Operations, at ¶¶ 4-6 - 4-8 (2008), available at <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.army.mil/fm3-0/fm3-0.pdf.  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.army.mil/fm3-0/fm3-0.pdf.%27" tppabs="http://www.army.mil/fm3-0/fm3-0.pdf."><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.army.mil/fm3-0/fm3-0.pdf.</span></a></span>¶ Battle command is a subset of combat leadership—it is how wartime leaders operationalize their intent and transmit their guidance to subordinate units. Battle command is the art and science of understanding, visualizing, describing, directing, leading, and assessing forces to impose the commander’s will on a hostile, thinking, and adaptive enemy. Battle command applies leadership to translate decisions into actions—by synchronizing forces and warfighting functions in time, space, and purpose—to accomplish missions. Battle command is guided by professional judgment gained from experience, knowledge, education, intelligence, and intuition. It is driven by commanders.¶ Id. at ¶ 5-9. Battlefield decisionmaking involves the visualization of the battlefield and all its components, the deliberate assessment of operational risk, and the selection of a course of action which accepts certain risks in order to achieve tactical, operational or strategic success. Id. at ¶5-10; see also Gen. Frederick M. Franks, Jr., Battle Command: A Commander’s Perspective, Military Review, May-June 1996, at 120-121. “Given the inherently uncertain nature of war, the object of planning is not to eliminate or minimize uncertainty but to foster decisive and effective action in the midst of such uncertainty.” Army Field Manual 3-07, Stability Operations, at ¶ 4-4 (2008), available at <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://usacac.army.mil/cac2/repository/FM307/FM3-  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://usacac.army.mil/cac2/repository/FM307/FM3-%27" tppabs="http://usacac.army.mil/cac2/repository/FM307/FM3-"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://usacac.army.mil/cac2/repository/FM307/FM3-</span></a></span> 07.pdf.¶ In bringing this case, Plaintiff asks this Court to substitute itself as the battlefield commander, and to second-guess the strategic, operational and tactical decisions made by this nation’s military chain of command in the campaign against Al Qaeda. Judicial decisionmaking is incompatible with military decisionmaking. Rather than produce rapid, confident, decisive actions, judicial resolution of this matter would produce deliberate and measured decisions which are the product of adversarial process, and which would reflect judicial considerations, not strategic or tactical ones.¶ Also, judicial involvement may induce risk aversion among commanders, who would worry about how their actions might be judged in courtrooms far removed from the battlefield, and thus hedge their battlefield decisions in order to protect themselves and their units from future judicial scrutiny. This is particularly true of Plaintiff’s prayer for relief, which calls upon the Court to enjoin the Government from using lethal force “except in circumstances in which they present concrete, specific, and imminent threats to life or physical safety, and there are no means other than lethal force that could reasonably be employed to neutralize the threats.” Such decisions about the use of force can often be made by soldiers in a split-second, on the basis of intuition and training. The specter of judicial involvement will affect the way soldiers and leaders approach these decisions, potentially complicating and slowing their decisions by injecting judicial considerations which have no place on the battlefield.<br/>review of TKs compromises unity of command---that’s fundamental to warfighting and successful operations---the plan injects devastating legal uncertainty into battlefield decisionmaking <br/>Maher 10 (Larry Maher 10, Quartermaster General, Veterans of Foreign Wars, et al, 9/30/10, BRIEF OF THE VETERANS OF FOREIGN WARS OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE IN SUPPORT OF DEFENDANTS AND DISMISSAL, Nasser al-Aulaqi, Plaintiff, vs. Barack H.

Adjudication Of This Case Would Compromise The Military Principle Of “Unity Of Command,” And Undermine The Chain Of Command “Unity of command,” and its corollary, “unity of effort,” are fundamental principles of warfare which are central to the effectiveness of Western militaries. See Carl von Clausewitz, On War 200-210 (Michael Howard and Peter Paret, ed. and trans., Princeton University Press 1976) (1832) (hereinafter “Clausewitz”). There “is no higher and simpler law of strategy” than to apply this principle in order to concentrate a nation’s military power its adversaries’ “center of gravity.” Id. at 204. This principle was first embraced by the American military during the 19th Century, and has subsequently shaped the organizational structure of American warfighting through two world wars and countless other conflicts. See James F. Schnabel, History of the Joints Chiefs of Staff, Vol. 1 at 80-87 (1996); Russell F. Weigley, History of the United States Army at 422-423 (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1984). Unity of command requires the integration of all combat functions into a single organizational element, with command authority vested in a single individual. See U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Joint Pub. 3-0, Joint Operations at Appx. A, p. A-2 (2010), available at <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/new_pubs/jp3_0.pdf.  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/new_pubs/jp3_0.pdf.%27" tppabs="http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/new_pubs/jp3_0.pdf."><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/new_pubs/jp3_0.pdf.</span></a></span> The U.S. military implements “unity of command” through its chain of command—a hierarchical organizational structure which transmits command authority from the President through the Secretary of Defense, through subordinate military officers, down to the lowest ranking soldier, sailor, airman or Marine on the frontlines of America’s armed conflicts. This chain of command serves important organizational purposes, by vesting command authority in individual officers who are responsible for specific missions, and are empowered to command their personnel to achieve those missions. The chain of command also supports important normative and legal policy purposes, such as the doctrine of “command responsibility,” which renders battlefield commanders responsible for all their units do or fail to do, whether they knew about such conduct, or should have known about it. See Application of Yamashita, 327 U.S. 1, 14-16 (1946); see also Army Field Manual 27-10, The Law of Land Warfare at ¶ 501 (1956) (stating U.S. Army doctrine on “command responsibility”). “Everything in war is very simple,” Clausewitz noted, “but the simplest thing is difficult.” Clausewitz at 119. The dangers of war, the fatigue of close combat, and the uncertainty which lurks within the fog of war, all combine to create a kind of “friction” which impedes the progress of armies. Id. A more contemporary author and veteran describes this fog: For the common soldier, at least, war has the feel, the spiritual texture, of a great ghostly fog, thick and permanent. There is no clarity. Everything swirls. The old rules are no longer binding, the old truths no longer true. Right spills over into wrong. Order blends into chaos, love into hate, ugliness into beauty, law into anarchy, civility into savagery. The vapor sucks you in. You can’t tell where you are, or why you’re there, and the only certainty is overwhelming ambiguity . . . . You lose your sense of the definite, hence your sense of truth itself. Tim O’Brien, The Things They Carried 88 (1990). The military chain of command is designed to counteract this fog and friction of war, by providing clarity of orders and purpose to individual soldiers and their units. Similarly, this organizational structure exists to impose some order on the behavior and actions of soldiers and units, aligning their conduct with national goals, framing their actions in the context of strategic and operational campaigns, and focusing their efforts on the missions which support these broader endeavors. It is this structure which differentiates the armed forces of a nation from an armed group of thugs, and which ensures that national armed forces conduct themselves in accordance with the laws of armed conflict. Cf. Annex to the Convention, Hague Convention No. IV Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land, art. 1, Oct. 18, 1907, 36 Stat. 2277, 205 Consol. T.S. 277; Geneva Convention (III) Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, art. 4, Aug. 12, 1949, 6 U.S.T. 3316, T.I.A.S. No. 3364. Our nation’s military personnel depend on their chain of command to provide them with certainty, clarity and authority in the heat of battle. Into this ordered system, Plaintiff wishes to inject the uncertainty of the American adversarial litigation process, by seeking, inter alia, that this Court declare there is no armed conflict in Yemen, and that orders issued by the President in response to that conflict should be enjoined. Not only would this force the court to go far beyond the “limited institutional competence of the judiciary” by involving it in sensitive matters of national security, cf. Arar v. Ashcroft, 585 F.3d 559, 576 (2d Cir. 2009) (citations omitted), but this also would undermine the chain of command by literally interposing this Court between the President and his subordinate officers, thereby contravening the core doctrinal principle of “unity of command,” which has served American military forces in good stead since the Civil War. In asking the Court to hear this case, and to entertain the extraordinary remedy of injunctive relief against the President and his cabinet, the Plaintiff is asking the court to overturn the political judgment of the President and Congress that the nation is at war; that this war is an armed conflict against Al Qaeda; and that it is appropriate to use a blend of military, intelligence and diplomatic force to wage this war. All three branches of Government have decided that “we are &nbsp;at war with al Qaeda and its affiliates.” Remarks of the President on National Security, May 21, 2009; see also Authorization for Use of Military Force (“AUMF”), Pub. L. No. 107-40, 115 Stat. 224 (2001); Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 548 U.S. 557, 628-31 (2006). Political leaders from both political parties, over the course of two presidencies and five elected Congresses, have agreed upon, authorized, and appropriated funds for this war against Al Qaeda. It is a fundamental axiom among American strategists that, “as a nation, the United States wages war employing all instruments of national power – diplomatic, informational, military, and economic.” U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Joint Pub. 1, Doctrine for the Armed Forces of the United States at I-1 (2009), available at <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/new_pubs/jp1.pdf.  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/new_pubs/jp1.pdf.%27" tppabs="http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/new_pubs/jp1.pdf."><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/new_pubs/jp1.pdf.</span></a></span> Plaintiff would seek to overturn the considered judgment of this nation’s political leaders in choosing the national strategy for this war, including the Attorney General of the United States, who has written that, in this war against Al Qaeda, “we must use every weapon at our disposal . . . including direct military action, military justice, intelligence, diplomacy, and civilian law enforcement.” See Letter from Attorney General Eric H. Holder, Jr. to Sen. Mitch McConnell, February 3, 2010 (emphasis added). The relief requested by plaintiff is both extraordinary and inappropriate, and completely inconsistent with the strategic imperative for “unified action which ensures unity of effort focused on national objectives and leading to the conclusion of operations on terms favorable to the United States.” See Joint Pub. 1 at I-1.<br/>decks unit cohesion---undermines authority of orders and makes units turn against themselves in litigation <br/>Maher 10 (Larry Maher 10, Quartermaster General, Veterans of Foreign Wars, et al, 9/30/10, BRIEF OF THE VETERANS OF FOREIGN WARS OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE IN SUPPORT OF DEFENDANTS AND DISMISSAL, Nasser al-Aulaqi, Plaintiff, vs. Barack H.

See generally Richard Holmes, Acts of War (1986) (describing role of unit cohesion in mitigating fear and combat stress in World Wars I and II); James MacPherson, For Cause and Comrades (1997) (chronicling the motivations of American soldiers during the Civil War); Nancy Sherman, The Untold War (2010) (describing the emotional landscape of soldiering in Iraq and Afghanistan) Although war brings many emotions to the surface, unit cohesion matters more than any other motivating factor in the heat of battle. “Unit cohesion exists in a unit when the primary day-to-day goals of the individual soldier, of the small group with which he identifies, and of unit leaders, are congruent--with each giving his primary loyalty to the group so that it trains and fights as a unit with all members willing to risk death and achieve a common objective.” William Darryl Henderson, Cohesion: The Human Element in Combat, (1985), available at <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/ndu/cohesion/.  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/ndu/cohesion/.%27" tppabs="http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/ndu/cohesion/."><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/ndu/cohesion/.</span></a></span> Studies of wars throughout the 20th Century have shown unit cohesion to be the critical ingredient for the success or failure of small units. See Edward A. Shils and Morris Janowitz, “Cohesion and Disintegration in the Wehrmacht in World War II,” Public Opinion Quarterly 12 (Summer 1948) 280-315 (finding that unit cohesion translated into higher battlefield effectiveness, survivability and hardiness); Charles C. Moskos, Jr., The American Enlisted Man: The Rank and File in Today’s Military 144-46 (1970) (finding that close bonds between soldiers played a key role in determining unit effectiveness and survival in the Vietnam War); Samuel Rolbant, The Israeli Soldier: Profile of an Army 200-210 (1970) (finding that Israeli soldiers had “a very strong sense of mutual affection and attraction among unit members,” and that this cohesion contributed significantly to their exemplary combat performance); William Darryl Henderson, Why the Vietcong Fought: A Study of Motivation and Control in a Modern Army in Combat 107-118 (1979) (finding that a combination of “very strong cohesion” and simple logistics enabled the North Vietnamese Army to persevere against overwhelming firepower); Leonard Wong, “Combat Motivation in Today’s Soldiers,” 32 Armed Forces and Soc. No. 4, 659- 663 (2006) (concluding that, in Iraq and Afghanistan, American soldiers are primarily motivated by unit cohesion and comradeship, among other factors); Army Field Manual 6-22.5, Combat and Operational Stress Control Manual for Leaders and Soldiers, at ¶ 2-3 (2009) (“Unit cohesion and morale is the best predictor of combat resiliency within a unit or organization. Units with high cohesion tend to experience a lower rate of combat stress casualties than units with low cohesion and morale.). “I hold it to be one of the simplest truths of war that the thing which enables an infantry soldier to keep going with his weapons is the near presence or the presumed presence of a comrade.” S.L.A. Marshall, Men Against Fire 42 (1947). In this lawsuit, Plaintiff asks this Court to declare that the U.S. Government is not engaged in an armed conflict in Yemen, and that U.S. personnel may not therefore use lethal force against individuals in Yemen absent “circumstances in which they present concrete, specific, and imminent threats to life or physical safety, and there are no means other than lethal force that could reasonably be employed to neutralize the threats.” Further, plaintiff seeks disclosure of the allegedly classified criteria used to designate U.S. citizens for targeting. And, in this suit’s most extraordinary request, Plaintiff asks this Court to enjoin the President, his advisers, and his generals, from conducting certain parts of the nation’s war against Al Qaeda. As described above, judicial action of the sort requested by Plaintiff would have a deleterious effect on the chain of command. Judicial action also would, necessarily, affect unit cohesion by undermining both the vertical bonds among leaders and followers, and the horizontal bonds among comrades. These bonds depend on the clarity of orders and authorities which are the sine qua non of the military organizational structure. A judicial order on the lawfulness of the armed conflict in Yemen, or the appropriateness of U.S. military actions there, would cast doubt upon the orders of the President and his subordinate military officers, and introduce uncertainty into the military structure. Further, should this suit be allowed to proceed, it may eventually result in litigation relating to actions taken by military forces in Yemen. Such litigation may require units and soldiers to participate in the production of documents, interrogation of witnesses, and presentation of evidence at trial in an adversarial proceeding. Such litigation would rip apart the military units it touched, by pitting comrades against each other as potential witnesses, and creating the risk that every uttered or written word could eventually be used in a future courtroom, making every battlefield act susceptible to secondguessing and criticism. At its core, unit cohesion reflects a core trust among comrades so powerful that it would motivate a soldier to sacrifice his or her life for another, such that “combat soldiers describe the bond, hesitantly or openly, as love.” See Army Field Manual 22- 51, Leaders’ Manual for Combat Stress Control, at ¶ 3-7 (1994). Judicial intervention in this matter would erode that bond for the units touched by this process, undermining their effectiveness and our national security.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>TK Good<br/>TK is key to solve terrorism – Anderson evidence indicates that its key to solve w/o counterinsurgency – we can strike Yemen and Mali leadership which disrupts the group – the fact that its unpred means they don’t plan attacks&nbsp;</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>Drone-based decapitation strategy key<br/>Johnston 12 (Patrick B.

A recent poll shows that while most Americans approve of drone strikes, in 17 out of 20 countries, more than half of those surveyed disapprove of them.<br/>My study of leadership decapitation in 90 counter-insurgencies since the 1970s shows that when militant leaders are captured or killed militant attacks decrease, terrorist campaigns end sooner, and their outcomes tend to favor the government or third-party country, not the militants.<br/>Those opposed to drone strikes often cite the June 2009 one that targeted Pakistani Taliban <br/>AND<br/>cited drone strikes as a key motivation for his May 2010 attempted attack.<br/>Compared to manned aircraft, drones have some advantages as counter-insurgency tools, such as lower costs, longer endurance and the lack of a pilot to place in harm's way and risk of capture. These characteristics can enable a more deliberative targeting process that serves to minimize unintentional casualties. But the weapons employed by drones are usually identical to those used via manned aircraft and can still kill civilians—creating enmity that breeds more terrorists.<br/>Yet many insurgents and terrorists have been taken off the battlefield by U.S. drones and special-operations forces. Besides Mehsud, the list includes Anwar al-Awlaki of al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula; al-Qaida deputy leader Abu Yahya al-Li-bi; and, of course, al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden. Given that list, it is possible that the drone program has prevented numerous attacks by their potential followers, like Shazad.<br/>What does the removal of al-Qaida leadership mean for U.S. national security? Though many in al-Qaida's senior leadership cadre remain, the historical record suggests that "decapitation" will likely weaken the organization and could cripple its ability to conduct major attacks on the U.S. homeland.<br/>Killing terrorist leaders is not necessarily a knockout blow, but can make it harder for terrorists to attack the U.S. Members of al-Qaida's central leadership, once safely amassed in northwestern Pakistan while America shifted its focus to Iraq, have been killed, captured, forced underground or scattered to various locations with little ability to communicate or move securely.<br/>Recently declassified correspondence seized in the bin Laden raid shows that the relentless pressure from the drone campaign on al-Qaida in Pakistan led bin Laden to advise al-Qaida operatives to leave Pakistan's Tribal Areas as no longer safe. Bin Laden's letters show that U.S. counterterrorism actions, which had forced him into self-imposed exile, had made running the organization not only more risky, but also more difficult.<br/>As al-Qaida members trickle out of Pakistan and seek sanctuary elsewhere, the U.S. military is ramping up its counterterrorism operations in Somalia and Yemen, while continuing its drone campaign in Pakistan. Despite its controversial nature, the U.S. counter-terrorism strategy has demonstrated a degree of effectiveness.<br/>The Obama administration is committed to reducing the size of the U.S. military's footprint overseas by relying on drones, special operations forces, and other intelligence capabilities. These methods have made it more difficult for al-Qaida remnants to reconstitute a new safe haven, as Osama bin Laden did in Afghanistan in 1996, after his ouster from Sudan.<br/>Link – TK Good – General <br/>Targeted killing solves terrorism – degrades terrorist capabilities more than it increases recruitment or retal <br/>Fisher 7 (Jason, Judicial Clerk to the Honorable James O.

Scott Shane notes correctly other nations such as China are building their own drones and in the future U.S. forces could be attacked by them–our forces will not have a monopoly on their use forever. Fair enough, but he goes further, suggesting our current use of drones to target terrorists will backfire: <br/>If China, for instance, sends killer drones into Kazakhstan to hunt minority Uighur Muslims it accuses of plotting terrorism, what will the United States say? What if India uses remotely controlled craft to hit terrorism suspects in Kashmir, or Russia sends drones after militants in the Caucasus? American officials who protest will likely find their own example thrown back at them. <br/>“The problem is that we’re creating an international norm” — asserting the right to strike preemptively against those we suspect of planning attacks, argues Dennis M. Gormley, a senior research fellow at the University of Pittsburgh and author of Missile Contagion, who has called for tougher export controls on American drone technology. “The copycatting is what I worry about most.” <br/>This is a familiar trope of liberal critics who are always claiming we should forego <br/>AND<br/>and cut down our own arsenal–to encourage similar restraint from Iran. <br/>The argument falls apart rather quickly because it is founded on a false premise: <br/>AND<br/>is unilateral disarmament–which is what the New York Times implicitly suggests. <br/>Imagine if we did refrain from drone strikes against al-Qaeda–what would <br/>AND<br/>.

Although Netanyahu has an obvious interest in increasing pressure on Iran, it would be an error to regard these reports as simple rhetorical sensationalism. In my opinion, whether this year or next, Israel is likely to use its airforce to attack Iran.<br/>While it is impossible to know for sure whether Netanyahu will act, it is possible to consider the likely repercussions that would follow an Israeli attack. While it is likely that Iran would retaliate against Israel and possibly the US in response to any attack, it is unlikely that Iran will instigate a major war. Albeit for different reasons, Iran, Israel and the US all understand that a war would not serve their interests.<br/>First, the Israeli policy angle. If Netanyahu decides to order an attack on Iran, his focus will be on maximising the success of that action and minimising any negative consequences that might follow. In terms of Iranian retaliation, Israel would expect Iran’s core non-state allies Hamas, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hezbollah to launch rocket attacks into Israeli territory.<br/>However, present success with advanced defence systems has helped increase Israeli confidence in their <br/>AND<br/>shown Israel that Iran continues to regard covert action as a powerful weapon.<br/>The key for Israel is that, while these Iranian capabilities are seen as credible<br/>AND<br/>Assad alongside Iran (an outcome that might follow major retaliatory Israeli action).<br/>If Netanyahu does decide to take action, Israeli objectives would be clearly limited. The intent would be to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear capability while minimising escalation towards war. Israel has no interest in a major conflict that would risk serious damage to the Israeli state.<br/>Though holding opposite objectives, Iran’s attitude concerning a major war is similar to Israel’s.<br/>While Iran regards nuclear capability as prospectively guaranteeing the survival of its Islamic revolution, clerical leaders also understand that initiating a major war would make American intervention likely. Such intervention would pose an existential threat to the theocratic project that underpins the Islamic Republic.<br/>Thus, in the event of an Israeli attack, Iran’s response would be finely calibrated towards achieving three objectives:<br/>• First, punishing Israel for its attack.<br/>• Second, deterring further Israeli strikes and so creating space for a reconstituted Iranian nuclear programme.<br/>• Finally, weakening US/international support for Israel so as to increase Israeli isolation and vulnerability.<br/>Hezbollah, Hamas and other non-state allies would play a major role in effecting Iranian retaliation. Iran may also attempt to launch a number of its new Sajjil-2 medium-range missiles against Israel. Again, however, using these missiles would risk major retaliation if many Israeli citizens were killed.<br/>As a preference, Iran would probably perceive that utilising Hamas and Hezbollah would allow retaliation without forcing Netanyahu into a massive counter-response. Crucially, I believe Iran regards that balancing its response would enable it to buy time for a reconstituted, hardened nuclear programme. In contrast to the relatively open current structure, sites would be deeper underground and far less vulnerable to a future attack. The nuclear ambition would not be lost, simply delayed. <br/>As a final objective for retaliation, Iran would wish to weaken Israel’s relationship with the US and the international community. This desire might encourage Iran to take action against US navy assets in the Gulf and/or attempt to mine the Strait of Hormuz, so as to cause a price spike in global oil markets and increased international discomfort.<br/>However, beyond their rhetoric, the Iranian leadership understand that they cannot win a military contest against the US, nor hold the strait for longer than a few days. For Iran then, as with Israel, regional war is far from desirable.<br/>Finally, consider the US. It is now clear that Obama and Netanyahu disagree on Iran. In my opinion, Netanyahu does not believe Obama will ever be willing to take pre-emptive military action against Iran’s nuclear programme. Conversely, Obama believes Netanyahu’s diplomatic expectations are too hasty and excessively restrictive.<br/>The policy distance between these two leaders appears increasingly irreconcilable. If Netanyahu decides to <br/>AND<br/>is that the US government has no interest in a war with Iran. <br/>If Netanyahu decides to take military action, he will do so in a strategic environment in which Israel, Iran and the US have no preference for a major war. Each state views the prospect of a war as counter to their particular long-term ambitions.<br/>Because of this, while serious, Iranian retaliation would be unlikely to produce an escalatory dynamic leading to war. The leadership of each of these states will restrain their respective actions in the pursuit of differing long-term objectives but common short-term ones.</p><p>Asia War</p><h4 id="HNoUS-Chinaconflict" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>No US-China conflict</span></h4><p><strong>Allison 26 Blackwill 13</strong> — *director of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs and Douglas Dillon Professor at Harvard’s John F.
