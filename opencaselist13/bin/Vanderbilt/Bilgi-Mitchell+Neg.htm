had to live with the knowledge that the next time the terrorists strike, it could be not with airplanes capable of killing thousands but atomic bombs capable of killing hundreds of thousands. The prospect has created a sense of profound vulnerability. It has shaped our view of government policies aimed at combating terrorism (filtered through Jack Bauer). It helped mobilize support for the Iraq war. Why are we worried? Bomb designs can be found on the Internet. Fissile material may be smuggled out of Russia. Iran, a longtime sponsor of terrorist groups, is trying to acquire nuclear weapons. A layperson may figure it’s only a matter of time before the unimaginable comes to pass. Harvard’s Graham Allison, in his book Nuclear Terrorism: The Ultimate Preventable Catastrophe, concludes, "On the current course, nuclear terrorism is inevitable." But remember: After Sept. 11, 2001, we all thought more attacks were a certainty. Yet Al Qaeda and its ideological kin have proved unable to mount a second strike. Given their inability to do something simple—say, shoot up a shopping mall or set off a truck bomb—it’s reasonable to ask if they have a chance at something much more ambitious. Far from being plausible, argued Ohio State University professor John Mueller in a recent presentation at the University of Chicago, "the likelihood that a terrorist group will come up with an atomic bomb seems to be vanishingly small." (<span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://polisci.osu.edu/faculty/jmueller/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://polisci.osu.edu/faculty/jmueller/%27" tppabs="http://polisci.osu.edu/faculty/jmueller/"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://polisci.osu.edu/faculty/jmueller/</span></a></span> APSACHGO.PDF) The events required to make that happen include a multitude of herculean tasks. First, a terrorist group has to get a bomb or fissile material, perhaps from Russia’s inventory of decommissioned warheads. If that were easy, one would have already gone missing. Besides, those devices are probably no longer a danger, since weapons that are not scrupulously maintained (as those have not been) quickly become what one expert calls "radioactive scrap metal." If terrorists were able to steal a Pakistani bomb, they would still have to defeat the arming codes and other safeguards designed to prevent unauthorized use. As for Iran, no nuclear state has ever given a bomb to an ally—for reasons even the Iranians can grasp. Stealing some 100 pounds of bomb fuel would require help from rogue individuals inside some government who are prepared to jeopardize their own lives. The terrorists, notes Mueller, would then have to spirit it "hundreds of miles out of the country over unfamiliar terrain, and probably while being pursued by security forces." Then comes the task of building a bomb. It’s not something you can gin up with spare parts and power tools in your garage. It requires millions of dollars, a safe haven and advanced equipment—plus people with specialized skills, lots of time and a willingness to die for the cause. And if Al Qaeda could make a prototype, another obstacle would emerge: There is no guarantee it would work, and there is no way to test it. Assuming the jihadists vault over those Himalayas, they would have to deliver the weapon onto American soil. Sure, drug smugglers bring in contraband all the time—but seeking their help would confront the plotters with possible exposure or extortion. This, like every other step in the entire process, means expanding the circle of people who know what’s going on, multiplying the chance someone will blab, back out or screw up. Mueller recalls that after the Irish Republican Army failed in an attempt to blow up British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, it said, "We only have to be lucky once. You will have to be lucky always." Al Qaeda, he says, faces a very different challenge: For it to carry out a nuclear attack, everything has to go right. For us to escape, only one thing has to go wrong. That has heartening implications. If Osama bin Laden embarks on the project, he has only a minuscule chance of seeing it bear fruit. Given the formidable odds, he probably won’t bother. None of this means we should stop trying to minimize the risk by securing nuclear stockpiles, monitoring terrorist communications and improving port screening. But it offers good reason to think that in this war, it appears, the worst eventuality is one that will never happen.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HTerrorismisn2019tanexistentialthreat" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Terrorism isn’t an existential threat</span></h4><p>Fettweis 10 – Christopher, assistant professor of national security affairs at the U.S. Naval War College<br/>2010, Threat and Anxiety in US Foreign Policy’, Survival, 52:2<br/>Even terrorists equipped with nuclear, biological or chemical weapons would be incapable of causing <br/>AND<br/>unpleasant as such events would be, they do not represent existential threats.</p><h4 id="HPakistanis2019preferdronestoPakistanimilitarycrackdowns" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Pakistanis’ prefer drones to Pakistani military crackdowns</span></h4><p>Anderson 13<br/>~Kenneth Anderson, Professor of International Law at American University, June 2013, "The Case for Drones," Commentary, Vol. 135, No. 6~<br/>There is also debate about the degree to which villagers are aware that the American <br/>AND<br/>concerns about whether villages might be sufficiently provoked against American infantry are subsiding.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HPreferourevidencetotheirpropaganda2014doomsdayscenariosinvolvingextremisttakeoversofPaksitaninuclearweaponsaredesignedtomakePakistanlookunreliable2014inreality2CfacilitiesareheavilyguaradedandnoneoftheIslamistgroupsinsidePakistanwouldusenuclearweaponsorgivethemtoterrorists." class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Prefer our evidence to their propaganda—doomsday scenarios involving extremist takeovers of Paksitani nuclear weapons are designed to make Pakistan look unreliable—in reality, facilities are heavily guaraded and none of the Islamist groups inside Pakistan would use nuclear weapons or give them to terrorists.</span></h4><p>Momin Iftikhar, an expert on issues related to Indian security, domestic and foreign policy, 8/29/2007.

Rather<br/>AND<br/>Army’s Future Combat System, an ensemble of futuristic tanks and armored vehicles.<br/>The proposed cancellation or termination of these and other multibillion-dollar programs has provoked a firestorm of criticism from lobbyists, promilitary organizations, Congressional hawks and members of Congress whose districts will suffer manufacturing losses if the systems are cut. Major media outlets have fed the flames by portraying Gates’s overhaul as a set of massive spending cuts, even though spending would increase by 4 percent.<br/>As the debate proceeds, the cancellations will no doubt generate most of the Congressional skirmishes and headlines. But far more important from a strategic perspective are the programs Gates wants to add or augment. These include Predator drones, sensor-equipped turboprop planes, conventional helicopters, the littoral combat ship (LCS) and expanded Special Operations capabilities—mostly low-tech systems intended for use in counterinsurgency or low-intensity environments.<br/>These programs are far less costly than the super-sophisticated weapons Gates seeks to <br/>AND<br/>we are most likely to face in the years ahead," he declared.<br/>The similarities between Gates’s proposals and the strategy adopted by the Kennedy administration are too <br/>AND<br/>of force and therefore a new and wholly different kind of military training."<br/>After the tragedy of Vietnam, officers purged military thinking of its counterinsurgency leanings and <br/>AND<br/>doing right now so successfully in both Iraq and Afghanistan," he said.<br/>The ghosts of Vietnam are everywhere in Gates’s budget request and in his accompanying statements<br/>AND<br/>on training and equipping foreign soldiers to engage in counterterror and counterinsurgency operations.<br/>The most immediate requirement for these initiatives, Gates says, is to be found <br/>AND<br/>intensity wars are the principal arenas in which US forces will be engaged.<br/>Gates has not said where, exactly, he sees troops fighting what could be <br/>AND<br/>like Mali, Chad and Somalia hint at what might be in store.<br/>Gates is too careful to speak in public of such scenarios. But by optimizing capabilities for combat in these settings, he risks inculcating a predisposition to engage in more wars of this type. It is essential, then, that Congress and the public devote as much attention to the strategic implications of Gates’s focus on counterinsurgency as to the economic and jobs implications of eliminating certain big-ticket weapons systems.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HIrregularwarfightingpreventsfailedstatesandconflictsfromeruptingintheCaucasus2CBalkans2CPakistan2CAfghanistan2CSoutheastAsia2CCanadaandenvironmentaldestruction" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Irregular warfighting prevents failed states and conflicts from erupting in the Caucasus, Balkans, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Southeast Asia, Canada and environmental destruction</span></h4><p>Record ’2<br/>(Jeffrey, Teaches Strategy @ Air War College, Parameters, "Collapsed Countries, Casualty Dread, and the New American Way of War", Summer, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.carlisle.army.mil/USAWC/PARAMETERS/02summer/record.htm)/rob  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.carlisle.army.mil/USAWC/PARAMETERS/02summer/record.htm)/rob%27" tppabs="http://www.carlisle.army.mil/USAWC/PARAMETERS/02summer/record.htm)/rob"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.carlisle.army.mil/USAWC/PARAMETERS/02summer/record.htm)/rob</span></a></span></p><p>The most devastating foreign attack in American history was planned and carried out at the <br/>AND<br/>in control of many states where such governments do not now exist."10</p><h3 id="H5" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>5</span></h3><h4 id="HKerryispushingIndiancooperationonclimatechangenow2Cbutthere2019sresistance2014keytomodeling.Theimpactisextinction" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Kerry is pushing Indian cooperation on climate change now, but there’s resistance—key to modeling.

But this is a serious mistake. Rather than ’return’ security to the state, we need to resist the security fetish per se, for it is partly this that blinds~sic~ us to the ways in which we might intervene against the forms of domination and exploitation that take place under the label of security. This is what cannot be grasped in thinking about security in terms of its ’privatisation’, but can be grasped in terms of the critique of security. If the movement against capital is a movement against fetishism, as it must be, then it must set as one of its targets the current fetishism surrounding security. In so doing it must aim at the combined overthrow of the security industry and the security state.

The prospect has created a sense of profound vulnerability. It has shaped our view of government policies aimed at combating terrorism (filtered through Jack Bauer). It helped mobilize support for the Iraq war. Why are we worried? Bomb designs can be found on the Internet. Fissile material may be smuggled out of Russia. Iran, a longtime sponsor of terrorist groups, is trying to acquire nuclear weapons. A layperson may figure it’s only a matter of time before the unimaginable comes to pass. Harvard’s Graham Allison, in his book Nuclear Terrorism: The Ultimate Preventable Catastrophe, concludes, "On the current course, nuclear terrorism is inevitable." But remember: After Sept. 11, 2001, we all thought more attacks were a certainty. Yet Al Qaeda and its ideological kin have proved unable to mount a second strike. Given their inability to do something simple—say, shoot up a shopping mall or set off a truck bomb—it’s reasonable to ask if they have a chance at something much more ambitious. Far from being plausible, argued Ohio State University professor John Mueller in a recent presentation at the University of Chicago, "the likelihood that a terrorist group will come up with an atomic bomb seems to be vanishingly small." (<span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://polisci.osu.edu/faculty/jmueller/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://polisci.osu.edu/faculty/jmueller/%27" tppabs="http://polisci.osu.edu/faculty/jmueller/"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://polisci.osu.edu/faculty/jmueller/</span></a></span> APSACHGO.PDF) The events required to make that happen include a multitude of herculean tasks. First, a terrorist group has to get a bomb or fissile material, perhaps from Russia’s inventory of decommissioned warheads. If that were easy, one would have already gone missing. Besides, those devices are probably no longer a danger, since weapons that are not scrupulously maintained (as those have not been) quickly become what one expert calls "radioactive scrap metal." If terrorists were able to steal a Pakistani bomb, they would still have to defeat the arming codes and other safeguards designed to prevent unauthorized use. As for Iran, no nuclear state has ever given a bomb to an ally—for reasons even the Iranians can grasp. Stealing some 100 pounds of bomb fuel would require help from rogue individuals inside some government who are prepared to jeopardize their own lives. The terrorists, notes Mueller, would then have to spirit it "hundreds of miles out of the country over unfamiliar terrain, and probably while being pursued by security forces." Then comes the task of building a bomb. It’s not something you can gin up with spare parts and power tools in your garage. It requires millions of dollars, a safe haven and advanced equipment—plus people with specialized skills, lots of time and a willingness to die for the cause. And if Al Qaeda could make a prototype, another obstacle would emerge: There is no guarantee it would work, and there is no way to test it. Assuming the jihadists vault over those Himalayas, they would have to deliver the weapon onto American soil. Sure, drug smugglers bring in contraband all the time—but seeking their help would confront the plotters with possible exposure or extortion. This, like every other step in the entire process, means expanding the circle of people who know what’s going on, multiplying the chance someone will blab, back out or screw up. Mueller recalls that after the Irish Republican Army failed in an attempt to blow up British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, it said, "We only have to be lucky once. You will have to be lucky always." Al Qaeda, he says, faces a very different challenge: For it to carry out a nuclear attack, everything has to go right. For us to escape, only one thing has to go wrong. That has heartening implications. If Osama bin Laden embarks on the project, he has only a minuscule chance of seeing it bear fruit.

The prospect has created a sense of profound vulnerability. It has shaped our view of government policies aimed at combating terrorism (filtered through Jack Bauer). It helped mobilize support for the Iraq war. Why are we worried? Bomb designs can be found on the Internet. Fissile material may be smuggled out of Russia. Iran, a longtime sponsor of terrorist groups, is trying to acquire nuclear weapons. A layperson may figure it’s only a matter of time before the unimaginable comes to pass. Harvard’s Graham Allison, in his book Nuclear Terrorism: The Ultimate Preventable Catastrophe, concludes, "On the current course, nuclear terrorism is inevitable." But remember: After Sept. 11, 2001, we all thought more attacks were a certainty. Yet Al Qaeda and its ideological kin have proved unable to mount a second strike. Given their inability to do something simple—say, shoot up a shopping mall or set off a truck bomb—it’s reasonable to ask if they have a chance at something much more ambitious. Far from being plausible, argued Ohio State University professor John Mueller in a recent presentation at the University of Chicago, "the likelihood that a terrorist group will come up with an atomic bomb seems to be vanishingly small." (<span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://polisci.osu.edu/faculty/jmueller/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://polisci.osu.edu/faculty/jmueller/%27" tppabs="http://polisci.osu.edu/faculty/jmueller/"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://polisci.osu.edu/faculty/jmueller/</span></a></span> APSACHGO.PDF) The events required to make that happen include a multitude of herculean tasks. First, a terrorist group has to get a bomb or fissile material, perhaps from Russia’s inventory of decommissioned warheads. If that were easy, one would have already gone missing. Besides, those devices are probably no longer a danger, since weapons that are not scrupulously maintained (as those have not been) quickly become what one expert calls "radioactive scrap metal." If terrorists were able to steal a Pakistani bomb, they would still have to defeat the arming codes and other safeguards designed to prevent unauthorized use. As for Iran, no nuclear state has ever given a bomb to an ally—for reasons even the Iranians can grasp. Stealing some 100 pounds of bomb fuel would require help from rogue individuals inside some government who are prepared to jeopardize their own lives. The terrorists, notes Mueller, would then have to spirit it "hundreds of miles out of the country over unfamiliar terrain, and probably while being pursued by security forces." Then comes the task of building a bomb. It’s not something you can gin up with spare parts and power tools in your garage. It requires millions of dollars, a safe haven and advanced equipment—plus people with specialized skills, lots of time and a willingness to die for the cause. And if Al Qaeda could make a prototype, another obstacle would emerge: There is no guarantee it would work, and there is no way to test it. Assuming the jihadists vault over those Himalayas, they would have to deliver the weapon onto American soil. Sure, drug smugglers bring in contraband all the time—but seeking their help would confront the plotters with possible exposure or extortion. This, like every other step in the entire process, means expanding the circle of people who know what’s going on, multiplying the chance someone will blab, back out or screw up. Mueller recalls that after the Irish Republican Army failed in an attempt to blow up British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, it said, "We only have to be lucky once. You will have to be lucky always." Al Qaeda, he says, faces a very different challenge: For it to carry out a nuclear attack, everything has to go right. For us to escape, only one thing has to go wrong. That has heartening implications. If Osama bin Laden embarks on the project, he has only a minuscule chance of seeing it bear fruit. Given the formidable odds, he probably won’t bother. None of this means we should stop trying to minimize the risk by securing nuclear stockpiles, monitoring terrorist communications and improving port screening. But it offers good reason to think that in this war, it appears, the worst eventuality is one that will never happen.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HHegfails2014theycan2019taccesstheirimpacts" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Heg fails—they can’t access their impacts</span></h4><p>Layne 06 – Associate Professor in the Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A26M University and Research Fellow with the Center on Peace and Liberty at The Independent Institute, (Christopher, Financial Times" America cannot rely on power alone," August 24th, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.ft.com/cms/s/f7bb5fb2-330c-11db-87ac-0000779e2340.html)  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.ft.com/cms/s/f7bb5fb2-330c-11db-87ac-0000779e2340.html)%27" tppabs="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/f7bb5fb2-330c-11db-87ac-0000779e2340.html)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.ft.com/cms/s/f7bb5fb2-330c-11db-87ac-0000779e2340.html)</span></a></span><br/>Hegemony, however, is not omnipotence.

Therefore, all the above and other analyzes (there is more, eg., the pattern of 90k-10k years characteristic of Glacial and Interglacial periods, etc.) indicate that the prediction of a "kill shot" from the Sun by Patrick Geryl and others, will not happen, quite the opposite: we could be at the doorsteps of another Ice Age. When asked what he thought of the "kill shot" model during our times, Leif Svaalgard called it "sensationalism". Robert’s book "Not by Fire but by Ice" has it’s name for a reason. People are being lured to look in the wrong direction by MSM, IPCC and others, but the facts are very clear and show a completely different problem that humanity will have to face very soon.

The prospect has created a sense of profound vulnerability. It has shaped our view of government policies aimed at combating terrorism (filtered through Jack Bauer). It helped mobilize support for the Iraq war. Why are we worried? Bomb designs can be found on the Internet. Fissile material may be smuggled out of Russia. Iran, a longtime sponsor of terrorist groups, is trying to acquire nuclear weapons. A layperson may figure it’s only a matter of time before the unimaginable comes to pass. Harvard’s Graham Allison, in his book Nuclear Terrorism: The Ultimate Preventable Catastrophe, concludes, "On the current course, nuclear terrorism is inevitable." But remember: After Sept. 11, 2001, we all thought more attacks were a certainty. Yet Al Qaeda and its ideological kin have proved unable to mount a second strike. Given their inability to do something simple—say, shoot up a shopping mall or set off a truck bomb—it’s reasonable to ask if they have a chance at something much more ambitious. Far from being plausible, argued Ohio State University professor John Mueller in a recent presentation at the University of Chicago, "the likelihood that a terrorist group will come up with an atomic bomb seems to be vanishingly small." (<span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://polisci.osu.edu/faculty/jmueller/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://polisci.osu.edu/faculty/jmueller/%27" tppabs="http://polisci.osu.edu/faculty/jmueller/"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://polisci.osu.edu/faculty/jmueller/</span></a></span> APSACHGO.PDF) The events required to make that happen include a multitude of herculean tasks. First, a terrorist group has to get a bomb or fissile material, perhaps from Russia’s inventory of decommissioned warheads. If that were easy, one would have already gone missing. Besides, those devices are probably no longer a danger, since weapons that are not scrupulously maintained (as those have not been) quickly become what one expert calls "radioactive scrap metal." If terrorists were able to steal a Pakistani bomb, they would still have to defeat the arming codes and other safeguards designed to prevent unauthorized use. As for Iran, no nuclear state has ever given a bomb to an ally—for reasons even the Iranians can grasp. Stealing some 100 pounds of bomb fuel would require help from rogue individuals inside some government who are prepared to jeopardize their own lives. The terrorists, notes Mueller, would then have to spirit it "hundreds of miles out of the country over unfamiliar terrain, and probably while being pursued by security forces." Then comes the task of building a bomb. It’s not something you can gin up with spare parts and power tools in your garage. It requires millions of dollars, a safe haven and advanced equipment—plus people with specialized skills, lots of time and a willingness to die for the cause. And if Al Qaeda could make a prototype, another obstacle would emerge: There is no guarantee it would work, and there is no way to test it. Assuming the jihadists vault over those Himalayas, they would have to deliver the weapon onto American soil. Sure, drug smugglers bring in contraband all the time—but seeking their help would confront the plotters with possible exposure or extortion. This, like every other step in the entire process, means expanding the circle of people who know what’s going on, multiplying the chance someone will blab, back out or screw up. Mueller recalls that after the Irish Republican Army failed in an attempt to blow up British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, it said, "We only have to be lucky once. You will have to be lucky always." Al Qaeda, he says, faces a very different challenge: For it to carry out a nuclear attack, everything has to go right. For us to escape, only one thing has to go wrong. That has heartening implications. If Osama bin Laden embarks on the project, he has only a minuscule chance of seeing it bear fruit. Given the formidable odds, he probably won’t bother. None of this means we should stop trying to minimize the risk by securing nuclear stockpiles, monitoring terrorist communications and improving port screening. But it offers good reason to think that in this war, it appears, the worst eventuality is one that will never happen.</p><h4 id="HNoretaliation:-2" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>No retaliation:</span></h4><h4 id="HA29Nostrategictargetsandcan2019ttraceweapons-2" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>A) No strategic targets and can’t trace weapons</span></h4><p>Dowle 5 – Mark, Professor at the Graduate School of Journalism at Berkeley<br/>~Sept, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.alumni.berkeley.edu/Alumni/Cal_Monthly/September_2005/COVER_STORY-_Berkeleys_Big_Bang_Project_.asp~~cn  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.alumni.berkeley.edu/Alumni/Cal_Monthly/September_2005/COVER_STORY-_Berkeleys_Big_Bang_Project_.asp~~cn%27" tppabs="http://www.alumni.berkeley.edu/Alumni/Cal_Monthly/September_2005/COVER_STORY-_Berkeleys_Big_Bang_Project_.asp~~cn"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.alumni.berkeley.edu/Alumni/Cal_Monthly/September_2005/COVER_STORY-_Berkeleys_Big_Bang_Project_.asp~~cn</span></a></span><br/>Because terrorists tend to be stateless and well hidden, immediate retaliation in kind is <br/>AND<br/>traced, the source nation could claim that the material had been stolen.</p><h4 id="HB29Anti-warsentimentmeanstheU.S.wouldjuststepupinternalsecuritymeasures-2" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>B) Anti-war sentiment means the U.S. would just step up internal security measures</span></h4><p>Bremmer 4 – Ian, president of Eurasia Group and senior fellow at the World Policy Institute <br/>~"Suppose a new 9/11 hit America", New Statesman, Online~cn<br/>This time, the public response would move much more quickly from shock to anger<br/>AND<br/>have nowhere near the public support it enjoyed for the invasion of Afghanistan.</p><p>C) No nuclear contingency plans and fear of losing international support<br/>UN Foundation 1 <br/>~Sept 20, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.unwire.org/unwire/20010920/18354_story.asp-http://www.unwire.org/unwire/20010920/18354_story.asp~~cn  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path excluded from retrieval by the project\%27s Exclusions properties.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.unwire.org/unwire/20010920/18354_story.asp-http://www.unwire.org/unwire/20010920/18354_story.asp~~cn%27" tppabs="http://www.unwire.org/unwire/20010920/18354_story.asp-http://www.unwire.org/unwire/20010920/18354_story.asp~~cn"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.unwire.org/unwire/20010920/18354_story.asp-http://www.unwire.org/unwire/20010920/18354_story.asp~~cn</span></a></span><br/>In an all-out war against terrorism, the United States would be unlikely <br/>AND<br/>missiles and precision bombs, that are considered more effective than nuclear weapons.</p><h3 id="HSolvency-7" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Solvency</span></h3><h4 id="HEventhoughCongressandtheExecutivecanactwithoutawrittenopinionbutajudicialopinionwithoutareasonwhymakesthedecisionnon-binding-1" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Even though Congress and the Executive can act without a written opinion but a judicial opinion without a reason why makes the decision non-binding</span></h4><p>John Eastman 2006<br/>Eastman, Prof. Law @ Chapman and Director Claremont Con.
