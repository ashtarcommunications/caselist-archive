Those designing this specious argument had settled on the term "hair-trigger alert" in order to create a semantic debate and avoid real debate of the genuine high-alert issue.

I have a new article which I will send to you soon on definitions, they are still a big problem . . . In Oct 2008, I had a debate with Christopher Ford, who at that time had retired from being the US Special Rep for Nuclear Non-proliferation (they wouldn't let me record it, unfortunately) at the International Peace Institute. Ford, in this private setting, actually admitted that the US had a LOW capability (see my definitions) which was quite a switch from the previous US stance, but claimed that the US and Russia had an "understanding" that neither one would ever use LOW. I found this ludicrous, and asked since when did diplomats act on intentions rather than capabilities. I heard grunts of agreement. So . . . to be clear about this you will need to define these terms carefully and understand that RLOAD is a policy decision, but in reality the only way to actually prevent LOW is to eliminate the capability to LOW by extending the time required to launch beyond the minimal flight times of the missiles (12 to 30 minutes).<br/>Miscalc – Impact – A2: Missileers’ Consciences Solve<br/>Under LoW, someone will eventually “push the button”<br/>Hallam 10 – John, Nuclear Weapons Campaigner PND Nuclear Flashpoints, Co-Author and Co-Coordinator of the Appeal on Nuclear Weapons Operating Status from 44 Nobel Prizewinners and 362 NGOs<br/>Jan 2, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.pndnsw.org.au/articles/features/107-taking-the-apocalypse-off-the-agenda-presentation-to-south-asia-foundation.htmlcn  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.pndnsw.org.au/articles/features/107-taking-the-apocalypse-off-the-agenda-presentation-to-south-asia-foundation.htmlcn%27" tppabs="http://www.pndnsw.org.au/articles/features/107-taking-the-apocalypse-off-the-agenda-presentation-to-south-asia-foundation.htmlcn"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.pndnsw.org.au/articles/features/107-taking-the-apocalypse-off-the-agenda-presentation-to-south-asia-foundation.htmlcn</span></a></span><br/>James Low in his 1999 thesis already discussed, seems to suggest that we can <br/>AND<br/>an accidental nuclear war caused by faulty or misinterpreted Early Warning System data".<br/>Missileers would execute lawful orders and are still stuck in the Cold War/deterrence framework<br/>Hodge 8 – Nathan, writer for Jane’s Defence Weekly, and frequent contributor to Slate<br/>&nbsp;Aug, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.thebulletin.org/files/064003005.pdfcn  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.thebulletin.org/files/064003005.pdfcn%27" tppabs="http://www.thebulletin.org/files/064003005.pdfcn"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.thebulletin.org/files/064003005.pdfcn</span></a></span><br/>Other small, yet not insignificant, changes have taken place in the world of <br/>AND<br/>.

Nations will confront the same principles of deterrence, for example, when deciding to launch a targeted killing operation regardless of whether they conduct it through a drone or a covert amphibious assault team. <br/>Drones may make waging war more domestically palatable, but they don’t change the very serious risks of retaliation for an attacking state. Any state otherwise deterred from using force abroad will not significantly increase its power projection on account of acquiring drones. <br/>What’s more, the very states whose use of drones could threaten U.S. security – countries like China – are not democratic, which means that the possible political ramifications of the low risk of casualties resulting from drone use are irrelevant. For all their military benefits, putting drones into play requires an ability to meet the political and security risks associated with their use. <br/>Despite these realities, there remain a host of defensible arguments one could employ to discredit the Obama drone strategy. The legal justification for targeted killings in areas not internationally recognized as war zones is uncertain at best. <br/>Further, the short-term gains yielded by targeted killing operations in Pakistan, Somalia and Yemen, while debilitating to Al Qaeda leadership in the short-term, may serve to destroy already tenacious bilateral relations in the region and radicalize local populations. <br/>Yet, the past decade’s experience with drones bears no evidence of impending instability in the global strategic landscape. Conflict may not be any less likely in the era of drones, but the nature of 21st Century warfare remains fundamentally unaltered despite their arrival in large numbers.</p><h4 id="HDramaticshifttodronesintheSQuo" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Dramatic shift to drones in the SQuo</span></h4><p>Lefkowitz 13 – Jay, senior lawyer and former domestic policy advisor to President George W. <br/>~Mar 4, Financial Times, "Drones are no substitute for detention," www.ft.com/cms/s/0/dae6552c-84c2-11e2-891d-00144feabdc0.html~23axzz2dZnIVyqb~cs<br/>Memo to all those critics of Guantánamo Bay: beware what you wish for. <br/>AND<br/>promptly administered through military courts – instead of taking the easy way out.</p><h4 id="HNodroneshiftlink2013toomanyexternalfactors" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>No drone shift link – too many external factors</span></h4><p>Chesney 11 – Robert, Charles I.

She saw that a situation like Nazi Germany is different from the conventional understanding of a tyranny. Pitkin writes,<br/>Totalitarianism cannot be understood, like earlier forms of domination, as the ruthless exploitation of some people by others, whether the motive be selfish calculation, irrational passion, or devotion to some cause. Understanding totalitarianism's essential nature requires solving the central mystery of the holocaust—the objectively useless and indeed dysfunctional, fanatical pursuit of a purely ideological policy, a pointless process to which the people enacting it have fallen captive. (87)<br/>Totalitarianism is closely connected to bureaucracy; it is oppression by rules, rather than by people who have willfully chosen to establish certain rules. It is the triumph of the social.<br/>Critics (both friendly and hostile) have paid considerable attention to Arendt's category of <br/>AND<br/>and turning us into robots that mechanically serve its purposes" (4).<br/>Pitkin is critical of this version of the "social" and suggests that Arendt <br/>AND<br/>put it another way, theories of powerlessness are self-fulfilling prophecies.<br/>Arendt grants that there are people who willed the Holocaust, but she insists that <br/>AND<br/>"critical thought is in principle anti-authoritarian" (Lectures 38).<br/>By "thought" Arendt does not mean eremitic contemplation; in fact, she <br/>AND<br/>that harmony. One must consider carefully the arguments and viewpoints of others:<br/>Political thought is representative.

First, one does <br/>AND<br/>a world into which one enters and by which one might be changed.<br/>Second, passages like the above make some readers think that Arendt puts too much <br/>AND<br/>destroy truth, but they cannot replace it" ("Truth" 259).<br/>Facts have a strangely resilient quality partially because a lie "tears, as it <br/>AND<br/>of opinion is a farce unless factual information is guaranteed" (238).<br/>The sort of thinking that Arendt propounds takes the form of action only when it <br/>AND<br/>thoughts without reference to anyone else or to let others do one's thinking.<br/>Arendt's Polemical Agonism<br/>As I said, agonism does have its advocates within rhetoric—Burke, Ong<br/>AND<br/>"understood and believed" by others (Shape 5; emphasis added).<br/>Arendt's version is what one might call polemical agonism: it puts less emphasis on <br/>AND<br/>polemical agonism, success may be marked through the quality of subsequent controversy.<br/>Arendt quotes from a letter Kant wrote on this point:<br/>You know that I do not approach reasonable objections with the intention merely of refuting them, but that in thinking them over I always weave them into my judgments, and afford them the opportunity of overturning all my most cherished beliefs. I entertain the hope that by thus viewing my judgments impartially from the standpoint of others some third view that will improve upon my previous insight may be obtainable. &#123;Lectures 42)<br/>Kant's use of "impartial" here is interesting: he is not describing a <br/>AND<br/>butprovocative application of Arendt's notion of common, see Hauser 100-03).<br/>In polemical agonism, there is a sense in which one' s main goal is <br/>AND<br/>¬larged" &#123;Lectures 39); he wanted interlocutors, not acolytes.<br/>This is not consensus-based argument, nor is it what is sometimes called <br/>AND<br/>, the conflictual versus the collaborative, or argument as opposed to debate.<br/>Second, while polemical agonismrequires diversity among interlocutors, and thus seems an extraordinarily appropriate <br/>AND<br/>of argument versus when we are lusting for dominion ("Truth" 263).<br/>Like other proponents of agonism, Arendt argues that rhetoric does not lead individuals or <br/>AND<br/>in lack of imagination and failure to judge" ("Truth" 242).<br/>Agonism demands that one simultaneously trust and doubt one' s own perceptions, rely on <br/>AND<br/>these few have not become fewer in our time" &#123;Human 324).<br/>Yet, there are important positive political consequences of agonism.<br/>Arendt' s own promotion of the agonistic sphere helps to explain how the system could <br/>AND<br/>is, engage in rhetoric—then they are engaging in antitotalitarian action.<br/>In post-Ramistic rhetoric, it is a convention to have a thesis, <br/>AND<br/>not relativist, adversarial but not violent, independent but not expressivist rhetoric.</p></div></div></td><td>11/29/13</td></tr><tr><td style="width:100%; word-break:break-all; word-break:break-word;"><div><p><input onclick="saveEntry(3)" src="../../xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" tppabs="http://opencaselist13.paperlessdebate.com/xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" style="float:right;" title="Save" type="image" value="Save"></input>
