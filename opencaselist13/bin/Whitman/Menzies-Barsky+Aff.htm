In large part this may have been because these fields, including Middle East studies as practiced in the United States, were by the 1990s not what they had been 30 years earlier. The sharp decline (within academia, at least) of once dominant paradigms like a cultural-essentialist Orientalism and modernization theory resulted in the dissipation of the intellectual coherence that had characterized the field in its first decades. But the kind of intellectual fragmentation that had come to characterize Middle East studies was the norm across a great many other fields and disciplines and was counterbalanced, probably even outweighed, by the fact that many Middle East specialists, perhaps especially younger scholars, were now not only well versed in the theoretical and methodological issues and debates of their own disciplines but also routinely engaged with innovative work that cut across or transcended disciplinary boundaries. They could thus increasingly manage, without any great difficulty, to participate in productive scholarly conversations not only with their disciplinary colleagues (fellow historians, political scientists, anthropologists, literature specialists, etc.) but also with scholars from other disciplines interested in this part of the world and in others as well. &nbsp;Moreover, because so many scholars working on the Middle East were participants in the scholarly conversations and debates that had transformed broad segments of the humanities and the social sciences in recent decades, Middle East studies had to a considerable extent overcome its ~End Page 73~ insular and rather backward character and was now much more open to, and engaged with, the wider intellectual world than had once been the case. The developments of the last two or three decades, including the critiques of Orientalism and modernization theory; the broad range of new work on colonialism; innovative approaches to historical, social, and cultural analysis influenced by critical anthropology; and, more broadly, heightened interaction among disciplines and fields had given many within Middle East studies a new set of common languages that facilitated productive intellectual exchange.3 This was also a much more intellectually and politically self-aware and self-critical field than was once the case. As a result, the best of the new work in this field was by the beginning of the twenty-first century very much on a par with the best produced in other area studies fields, and scholars specializing in the Middle East were being read and listened to by scholars specializing in other parts of the world as never before.4 &nbsp;In conjunction with a generally higher level of mastery of relevant languages and the use of innovative theoretical and methodological approaches, scholars in the field were by the late twentieth century also making use of a broader range of sources than in the past. A case in point is work on the history of the Arab provinces of the Ottoman empire. Students and scholars with a command of both Arabic and Ottoman Turkish made increasing use not only of the vast Ottoman imperial archives in Istanbul but also of local Islamic court records and family papers, along with more traditional sources like the writings of European consuls and travelers, to produce portraits of social, political, economic, and cultural life in these lands in the last four hundred years of Ottoman rule of unprecedented depth and complexity.5 &nbsp;These studies helped to undermine what was once conventional wisdom in late Ottoman history, that these lands were economically, socially, and culturally stagnant before Napoleon’s army landed in Egypt in 1798; that they were uniformly characterized by despotism, the oppressive and retrograde imposition of Islamic law, and the rigorous segregation and subordination of non-Muslims; and that all real change was induced by contact with the West. Instead, the newer scholarship began to elucidate indigenous sources and dynamics of change while also showing how this ~End Page 74~ region was part of the broader sweep of world history long before the nineteenth century and the onset of westernization or modernization as conventionally understood. As a result of these scholarly advances, Ottoman historians often came to have much broader and more fully comparative perspectives than historians of early modern Europe, many of whom had only recently come to understand that they needed to overcome their own provincialism by addressing the ways in which developments in Europe were not utterly sui generis but often were bound up with larger patterns and dynamics of change that affected large stretches of Eurasia. &nbsp;&nbsp;Scholars and the State &nbsp;If the preceding assessment is accurate, it is fair to say that the changes that transformed Middle East studies in the United States over the last several decades of the twentieth century made it a more intellectually productive and interesting scholarly field. However, this development was accompanied by a growing gap between academics studying the Middle East and the officials, agencies, and institutions of the U.S. government, and a corresponding decline in the influence of university-based scholars on the shaping of foreign policy and on the media, the main purveyor of information, images, and attitudes about the region to the broad public. &nbsp;For one, a good many (though by no means all) students and scholars in this field were less than happy with U.S. government policies toward the Middle East in the 1980s and beyond. Hard evidence is lacking, but it is probably safe to suggest that much of the membership of the Middle East Studies Association, the field’s main professional organization, was not enthusiastic about U.S. support for Saddam Hussein’s regime in its war against Iran in the 1980s, the U.S.-led Gulf War of 1991, the sanctions regime imposed on Iraq thereafter, the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, or, more broadly, the extent to which successive U.S. administrations countenanced Israel’s ongoing occupation of the West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem; its continuing implantation of Jewish settlements there; and its rejection of a Palestinian state in those territories as endorsed by virtually the entire international community. There was a widespread (though never universal) ~End Page 75~ sense that the policies pursued by the United States in the Middle East were hindering, rather than contributing to, peace, democracy, human rights, development, and progress in the region. &nbsp;This disaffection from official policy and the premises that underpinned it did not mean that U.S.-based scholars studying the Middle East were unwilling to share their perspectives on, and try to influence, U.S. policy toward the region. In fact, many devoted a great deal of time and effort to trying to educate the broader public through informal meetings, lectures, articles, op-ed pieces, radio and television interviews, and the like, and to convey their views to elected officials; not a few were also quite willing to meet with State Department and intelligence agency personnel. It is rather that the shared vision of the world, and of the place of the United States within it, that had once linked the world of academia with the world of policymaking had faded, and many scholars no longer spoke the same language as policymakers. &nbsp;Adding to this sense of distance and alienation was a new and much more critical understanding of the proper relationship between scholars and the state—not a surprising development in the aftermath of a period in which the pernicious ends to which scholarly knowledge could be put had been made all too visible, in Vietnam but elsewhere as well. In the first decades of the Cold War a good many scholars in this as in other area studies fields, especially social scientists working on contemporary issues, saw no problem with conducting research on behalf of the government and cooperating with intelligence agencies because they were all part of the good fight against Communism. By the 1980s those who were assuming the leadership in U.S. Middle East studies were by and large much more wary about their sources of funding and the ends to which their training and research, and that of their students, might be put. Fewer scholars were willing to allow what they knew about the region to be used in the service of a state about whose policies they were often at least dubious, for example, by conducting research for agencies like the CIA or by encouraging promising students to enter government service. There developed a widespread sense that to allow one’s research agenda to be determined by the needs of the state or to serve potentially pernicious ends was not only a betrayal of one’s ~End Page 76~ integrity as a scholar but might also compromise one’s ability to conduct research in the Middle East, where by the 1980s real or alleged CIA connections had gotten Americans and others denounced, kidnapped, or worse. &nbsp;At issue was not government funding per se: since the passage of the National Defense Education Act in 1958, a great many students and scholars working on the Middle East had happily made use of NDFL/FLAS and other government fellowships for language training, graduate study, and research. A large proportion of the budgets of the centers for Middle East studies at universities around the country also came from the federal government. But because this individual and institutional funding came through the U.S. Department of Education it was deemed ethically and politically acceptable even by those who most vociferously disagreed with U.S. government policies in the Middle East. Similarly, additional government funding for graduate student and faculty research on the Middle East first made available by the 1992 Near and Middle East Research and Training Act—originally channeled through the Social Science Research Council and later through the Council of American Overseas Research Centers—was not seen as posing a problem because the funding was allocated first through the U.S. Information Agency and then through the State Department budget. &nbsp;The real issue was which part of the U.S. government was supplying the funding, for what ends, and with what conditions. As early as 1985 the Middle East Studies Association had asked "university-based international studies programs to refrain from responding to requests for research contract proposals from the Defense Academic Research Support Program ~established by the Defense Department to fund academic research on issues of interest to the military~ or from other intelligence entities and call~ed~ upon its members to reflect carefully upon their responsibilities to the academic profession prior to seeking or accepting funding from intelligence sources."6 Some years later MESA also criticized the new National Security Education Program (NSEP), created by the National Security Education Act of 1991. The NSEP sought to bolster the teaching of "less commonly taught" languages (including Arabic, Persian, and Turkish), thereby enabling (as the ~End Page 77~ program’s website put it) "the nation to remain integrally involved in global issues related to U.S. National Security" as well as to "develop a cadre of professionals with more than the traditional knowledge of language and culture who can use this ability to help the U.S. make sound decisions on and deal effectively with global issues related to U.S. National Security" (see the NSEP website at <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.iie.org/programs/nsep/nsephome.htm).  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.iie.org/programs/nsep/nsephome.htm).%27" tppabs="http://www.iie.org/programs/nsep/nsephome.htm)."><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.iie.org/programs/nsep/nsephome.htm).</span></a></span> Unlike other programs funding research and training on the Middle East, the NSEP was housed in the Department of Defense, intelligence agency officials sat on its oversight board, and recipients of the funding it offered were required to work for a government agency involved in national security affairs after their fellowship or scholarship was completed. In a 1993 resolution endorsed by a referendum of its membership, MESA joined with the African Studies Association and the Latin American Studies Association to "deplore the location of responsibility in the U.S. defense and intelligence community for a major foreign area research, education, and training program. . . . This connection can only increase the existing difficulties of gaining foreign governmental permissions to carry out research and to develop overseas instructional programs. It can also create dangers for students and scholars by fostering the perception of involvement in military or intelligence activities, and may limit academic freedom." MESA called on the government to establish a peer and merit review process for funding applications that would be independent of military, intelligence, and foreign policy agencies and to broaden the service requirement so that it would include a much wider range of jobs, including those outside government service. &nbsp;Until its concerns were met, MESA urged that "its members and their institutions not seek or accept program or research funding from NSEA...." Three years later MESA adopted yet another resolution reiterating its rejection of NSEP because the law appropriating funding for the program now required that all fellowship recipients agree to work for the Defense Department or some intelligence agency for at least two years or else repay the cost of their fellowship (see the NSEP website, as well as the MESA resolutions site at <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://w3fp.arizona.edu/mesassoc/resolutions.htm).  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://w3fp.arizona.edu/mesassoc/resolutions.htm).%27" tppabs="http://w3fp.arizona.edu/mesassoc/resolutions.htm)."><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://w3fp.arizona.edu/mesassoc/resolutions.htm).</span></a></span> (This last requirement was later relaxed somewhat so that recipients who ~End Page 78~ could not find employment with a national security agency despite a "good faith effort" to do so could fulfill the service requirement by working in higher education.) MESA would voice the same concerns about other outgrowths of the NSEP, for example, the 2002 National Flagship Language Initiative–Pilot Program (NFLI-P), launched to address what were seen as America’s extraordinary deficiencies in languages critical to national security. Many (though by no means all) Middle East studies faculty adopted MESA’s perspective on this issue, declining to seek NSEP funding for themselves or their institutions. &nbsp;The disinclination by MESA and many of its individual and institutional members to cooperate with the government in ways that had been common in the 1950s and 1960s was certainly not shared by everyone in the field. Yet it is instructive that when in the 1980s reports surfaced of questionable links between academics and intelligence agencies, the most vocal response among scholars in the field was condemnation. A case in point is the scandal surrounding Nadav Safran, a political scientist whose first book set forth an analysis of modern Egyptian history informed by modernization theory and who by the mid-1980s was director of Harvard University’s Center for Middle Eastern Studies. The scandal erupted when it became known that Safran had taken 2445,700 from the Central Intelligence Agency to fund a major international conference he was hosting at Harvard on "Islam and Politics in the Contemporary Muslim World"—a hot topic at the time and one of obvious interest to the CIA. Not only had Safran secretly used CIA funding for this conference, he had not told the invitees, a number of whom were coming from the Middle East, that the CIA was picking up the tab. It then came out that Safran had also received a 24107,430 grant from the CIA for the research project that led to his 1985 book Saudi Arabia: The Ceaseless Request for Security. Safran’s contract with the CIA stipulated that the agency had the right to review and approve the manuscript before publication and that its role in funding the book would not be disclosed. And indeed, the book as published made no mention of the fact that the research for it had been partially funded by the CIA. &nbsp;When the scandal broke, about half the invitees to Safran’s conference withdrew, and many of the faculty and students associated with Harvard’s ~End Page 79~ Center for Middle Eastern Studies publicly expressed their opposition to Safran’s actions. A month later the Middle East Studies Association censured Safran on the grounds that his actions had violated its 1982 resolution calling on scholars to disclose their sources of research funding. Safran intimated that his critics were motivated by anti-Semitism, but after an internal investigation at Harvard he agreed to step down as center director at the end of the academic year.7 Safran was surely not the only academic to have secretly or openly solicited or accepted funding from an intelligence agency for his research in this period, and no doubt such relationships persisted long after this scandal, but the reaction to it—unimaginable in the early decades of U.S. Middle East studies—does indicate how the relationship between academia and the state had changed. Think Tanks and Talking Heads &nbsp;But there was a price to be paid for the gap that had opened up between the world of Middle East scholarship and the world of policymaking. If many college- and university-based academics no longer entirely shared the worldview that prevailed in Washington or no longer felt the need to shape their research agenda so that it was relevant to the policies that flowed from that worldview, there were others who stood ready to meet the demand for knowledge that would serve the state. Many of these were based not in institutions of higher education but in the host of think tanks that had proliferated from the 1970s onward—privately funded institutions oriented toward the production and dissemination of knowledge designed to inform and influence public policy, for our purposes mainly the foreign policy of the United States. &nbsp;Some of these institutions and organizations went back a long way. The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, for example, was founded in 1910 to advance international cooperation, while the Council on Foreign Relations, publisher of the influential journal Foreign Affairs, was established in 1921, originally as a sort of elite dinner club. The liberal Brookings Institution was established in 1927, supported by Carnegie and Rockefeller funding, while the conservative American Enterprise Institute was founded ~End Page 80~ in 1943 to promote "limited government," "free enterprise," and a "strong foreign policy and national defense." After the Second World War, contractors like the huge RAND Corporation entered the field to produce or fund research for the military and intelligence and other government agencies concerned with foreign policy. Another wave beginning in the 1960s had witnessed the establishment of a large number of what one observer called "advocacy" think tanks, like the Center for Strategic and International Studies (1962), the Heritage Foundation (1973), and the Cato Institute (1977), which combined "policy research with aggressive marketing techniques" as they struggled to secure funding and influence in an increasingly competitive marketplace. There are now also many "legacy-based" institutions, like the Carter Center in Atlanta and the Nixon Center for Peace and Freedom in Washington, D.C. By the end of the twentieth century there were an estimated 2,000 organizations engaged in policy analysis based in the United States, a substantial proportion of them focused on foreign policy and international relations.8 The 1970s also witnessed the establishment of what Lisa Anderson called "a new generation of professional graduate schools of public policy," many of whose graduates went on to work for policy-oriented think tanks rather than in colleges and universities (Anderson 2000, 21). &nbsp;The Middle East was a relative backwater for the think tank industry until the 1980s. The Middle East Institute, founded in 1946, published a journal and organized conferences but exercised relatively little political clout. By contrast, the Washington Institute for Near East Policy (WINEP), founded in 1985, quickly achieved a much higher profile and much greater influence. Describing itself as "a public educational foundation dedicated to scholarly research and informed debate on U.S. interests in the Middle East,"9 WINEP emerged as the leading pro-Israel think tank in Washington. Its founding director, Martin Indyk, had previously worked at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), founded in 1959 and by the 1970s by far the most well-funded, visible, and effective pro-Israel lobbying organization.10 &nbsp;Indyk and his colleagues at WINEP worked hard to strengthen Israel’s standing in Washington as the key U.S. ally in the Middle East and to ensure ~End Page 81~ that U.S. policy in the region coincided with the policies and strategies of the Israeli government. During the late 1980s and early 1990s this meant trying to foil U.S. recognition of the PLO and U.S. pressure on Israel to halt settlement activity in the West Bank and Gaza and enter serious negotiations. In the 1990s WINEP expanded its purview to encompass the entire Middle East, but its focus always remained on Israel, for which it tried to build support by arguing that Israel and the United States faced a common threat from Islamic radicalism and terrorism, defined rather broadly to encompass virtually all of Israel’s enemies, state and nonstate. Various other think tanks also began or stepped up research and advocacy on Middle East issues in the late 1990s and early 2000s. These included the Haim Saban Center for Middle East Policy, launched by the Brookings Institution in 2002, and the conservative American Enterprise Institute. &nbsp;During the Clinton administration a substantial number of WINEP alumni served in key foreign policy positions, including Martin Indyk himself, appointed as special assistant to the president and senior director for Near East and South Asian affairs at the National Security Council and, later, as U.S. ambassador to Israel. They and other Clinton administration officials promulgated the policy of "dual containment," whereby the United States would seek to isolate, and if possible eliminate, the governments of both Iraq and Iran, not coincidentally perceived as two of Israel’s most serious enemies. By the late 1990s, however, WINEP would itself be outflanked by newer rivals that unlike WINEP openly aligned themselves with the stances of the Israeli right (or even far right) and argued for aggressive U.S. action against Israel’s enemies, including the overthrow of the regime of Saddam Hussein in Iraq. &nbsp;The policies these and other explicitly right-wing think tanks advocated during the Clinton years, when they were in the political wilderness, were initially regarded as extreme and outlandish. But many of them would eventually be adopted by the George W. Bush administration, in which their architects assumed key posts. Among them were Vice President Richard Cheney; Defense Policy Board member (and for a time chair) Richard Perle, a key advocate of war against Iraq; Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz; Undersecretary of State John Bolton; and Undersecretary ~End Page 82~ of Defense Douglas Feith. Before assuming power these (people) men and their colleagues had, through such right-wing organizations as the Project for a New American Century and the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs, called for the use of U.S. military power to dominate the world, massive increases in military spending, and unequivocal support for the policies of the Israeli right.11 After the attacks of September 11, 2001, President George W. Bush openly embraced much of their agenda, tacitly supporting Israel’s effort to crush the Palestinian uprising by force and in March-April 2003 invading and occupying Iraq. &nbsp;The first years of the twenty-first century thus witnessed an unprecedented convergence in positions of supreme power in Washington of right-wing (and in some cases Christian fundamentalist) zealots and neo-conservative American Jews united by a common vision of securing permanent and unchallengeable U.S. global hegemony, with a strong focus on the Middle East and a close embrace of Israel, a vision to be achieved by military force if necessary. The war against Iraq was in a sense the pilot project for this radical vision. As Michael Ledeen, in 2003 "resident scholar in the Freedom Chair" at the American Enterprise Institute and long a fixture among right-wing foreign-policy activists, was reported to have put it, crudely but not inaccurately: "Every ten years or so, the United States needs to pick up some small crappy little country and throw it against the wall, just to show the world we mean business" (Goldberg 2002). More specifically, a reconstructed, oil-rich Iraq was seen as a valuable new base for U.S. power in the Middle East, enabling the United States to terminate its problematic relationship with Saudi Arabia and compel the Arabs (including the Palestinians) to make peace with Israel on the latter’s terms. That the vast majority of the international community, including a great many Americans, vehemently rejected the use of military force to achieve this vision made no difference whatsoever to its advocates.12 &nbsp;There were certainly voices raised, in academia, the think tank world, and elsewhere, in opposition to this agenda and the understanding of the world that underpinned it, as there had been voices offering alternative views about U.S. policy toward the Middle East at other critical junctures. But during the 1980s, 1990s, and early years of the twenty-first century ~End Page 83~ these voices received relatively little attention, and university-based scholars seemed to play a decreasing role in influencing foreign policy. Critics of U.S. foreign policy also found it difficult to make themselves heard through the mass media. It is striking that the great bulk of the "talking heads" who appeared on television to offer their opinions on the 1990–91 Gulf crisis, on the 2003 Iraq war, and on other issues relating to the Middle East and U.S. policy toward it seemed to come not from academia but from professional pundits, from people associated with think tanks or with one of the public policy schools, and from retired military personnel. Whatever their knowledge (or lack thereof) of the languages, politics, histories, and cultures of the Middle East, these people spoke the language and shared the mindset of the Washington foreign policy world in a way few university-based scholars did. They were also used to communicating their perspective in effective sound bites, whereas academics were often put off by the ignorance and political conformism of much (though by no means all) of American mass media journalism and its tendency to crudely oversimplify complex issues and transform everything (even war) into a form of entertainment. &nbsp;This helped bring about a considerable narrowing of the perspectives available to the public and the consolidation of a powerful, indeed almost impenetrable, consensus about the Middle East that encompassed most of the political class and the punditocracy. Republicans and Democrats argued mainly over how best to maintain U.S. hegemony in the region, leaving very little room for those who envisioned a fundamentally different foreign policy founded on peace, democracy, human rights, mutual security, multilateral disarmament, nonintervention, and respect for international law. It is, however, worth noting that despite the virtual absence of such views in the mass media, they were embraced by a good many Americans, as evidenced by the massive demonstrations that preceded the U.S. attack on Iraq in March 2003 and the polls that indicated substantial public opposition to war, partly because of the new modes and channels of communication and organizing made possible by the Internet. &nbsp;Nonetheless, in the aftermath of September 11th, critical (and even moderate) voices were largely drowned out by the right, which quickly and effectively moved to implement its global agenda by exploiting public ~End Page 84~ outrage against the Islamist extremists who had perpetrated the September 11th attacks. They succeeded in "selling" first military intervention in Afghanistan (justified by the fact that the Taliban regime had allowed al-Qa’ida to operate in that country and refused to hand over those responsible for organizing the September 11th attacks) and then war against Iraq, even though no one was able to produce any credible evidence that the regime of Saddam Hussein had had anything to do with the September 11th attacks or still possessed weapons of mass destruction. In this effort conservative scholars like Bernard Lewis played a significant part, graphically illustrating their continuing, even enhanced, clout in right-wing policymaking circles long after their standing in scholarly circles had declined, as well as the durability and power of some very old Orientalist notions many had mistakenly thought dead as a doornail.</p></div></div></td><td>9/30/13</td></tr><tr><td style="width:100%; word-break:break-all; word-break:break-word;"><div><p><input onclick="saveEntry(31)" src="../../xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" tppabs="http://opencaselist13.paperlessdebate.com/xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" style="float:right;" title="Save" type="image" value="Save"></input>

Harvard University Press, pp. 1-10.<br/>Law schools the world over claim to instruct their students in how to "think like a lawyer." Studying law is not primarily about learning a bunch of legal rules, the law schools insist, for law has far more rules than can be taught in three years of legal education. Besides, many of the legal rules that might be learned in law school will have been changed by the time the students enter legal practice. Nor is legal education about be- ing instructed in where to stand in the courtroom or how to write a will, for many of these skills are better learned once in practice than at a uni- versity. Now it is true that both knowing some legal rules and acquiring the skills of lawyering are important to success in the practice of law. And it is also true that some of this knowledge is usefully gained in law school. But what really distinguishes lawyers from other sorts of folk, so it is said, is mastery of an array of talents in argument and decision- making that are often collectively described as legal reasoning. So even though law schools do teach some legal rules and some practical profes- sional skills, the law schools also maintain that their most important mis- sion is to train students in the arts of legal argument, legal decision- making, and legal reasoning—in thinking like a lawyer. 1 But is there a form of reasoning that is distinctively legal reasoning? Is there something that can be thought of as thinking like a lawyer? Of course some lawyers do think and reason better than others, but the same can be said for physicians, accountants, politicians, soldiers, and social workers. And many lawyers think more analytically, or more precisely, or 1 1. In the 1973 film The Paper Chase, the notorious Professor Kingsfield pro- vides a dramatic illustration of the traditional claim, proclaiming in his Contracts class that "you teach yourself the law. I train your minds. You come in here with a skull full of mush, and if you survive, you’ll leave thinking like a lawyer." more rigorously, than many ordinary people, but so do many economists, scientists, and investment bankers. So the claims of law schools to teach legal reasoning must be other than just teaching students how to think more effectively, or more rationally, or more rigorously. And indeed they are. Law schools aspire to teach their students how to think differently — differently from ordinary people, and differently from members of other professions. Lord Coke maintained as long ago as 1628 that there was an "artificial" reason to law 2 —a distinction between simple rationality and the special methods of the law, and particularly of judges. Of course Lord Coke might have been wrong. Perhaps he was mistaken to suppose that legal reasoning is distinctive, and perhaps legal reasoning is simply reasoning. Sometimes good reasoning, sometimes bad reasoning, and mostly in between, but nevertheless simply reasoning. But then again, Lord Coke might have been right. After all, the idea that legal reasoning is different from ordinary reasoning, even from very good ordinary rea- soning, has been the traditional belief of most lawyers, most judges, and most law schools for a very long time. So although the traditional belief in the distinctiveness of legal reasoning might be mistaken, it comes to us with a sufficiently distinguished provenance that the possibility that there is legal reasoning ought not to be dismissed out of hand. That there might be something distinctive about legal reasoning does not flow inexorably from the existence of law as a discrete profession, for it is far from obvious that those who take up some specialized calling must necessarily think and reason differently from those outside that calling. Electricians know things that carpenters do not, and carpenters know things that plumbers do not. But it would be odd to talk of think- ing like a carpenter or a plumber. Indeed, maybe it is just as odd to talk of thinking like a lawyer. Yet law schools do not think it odd, nor do most lawyers and judges. Law schools and the lawyers and judges they train suppose that lawyers are characterized by more than knowing things that nonlawyers do not. Knowledge of the law is important, as are skills of advocacy and drafting, but the traditional account of what makes law- yers distinctive is that they have something other than this. What lawyers have other than their technical skills and their knowl- 2 THINKING LIKE A LAWYER 2.

For a modern elaboration, see Charles Fried, "The Artificial Reason of the Law or: What Lawyers Know," 60 Tex. L. Rev. 35 (1981). edge of the law is not so simple to pin down, however. It is relatively easy to say what thinking like a lawyer is not. It is rather more difficult to say what it is, and that difficulty may account for part of why there have been numerous skeptical challenges over the years to law’s claim to distinctiveness. Legal Realists (about whom much more will be said in Chapter 7) such as Jerome Frank and (to a lesser extent) Karl Llewellyn insisted that lawyers and judges do not approach problems in any way that differs significantly from the approaches of other policymakers and public decision-makers. Many of the political scientists who study Su- preme Court decision-making often make similar claims, arguing that the ideologies, attitudes, politics, and policy preferences of the Justices play a larger role in the Court’s decisions than do any of the traditional methods of legal reasoning. 3 Psychologists examining the reasoning processes of lawyers and judges focus less on the supposedly characteristic modes of legal reasoning than on those shortcomings of rationality that bedevil all decision-makers, whether lawyers or not. 4 And as far back as the acid cri- tique of the legal profession ("Judge and Company," he called it) offered by Jeremy Bentham in the early part of the nineteenth century, 5 skeptical or deflationary accounts of legal reasoning have existed. Lawyers and judges may be lawyers and judges, so the common thread of these chal- lenges to the traditional story about legal reasoning goes, but they are also human beings, with more or less the full array of human talents and human failings. And the fact that lawyers and judges are human beings explains far more about the methods of legal and judicial reasoning, it 3 INTRODUCTION: IS THERE LEGAL REASONING? 3.

Jeremy Bentham, "Introductory View of the Rationale of Evidence," in 6 The Works of Jeremy Bentham 22–24 (John Bowring ed., 1843). is said, than anything that lawyers or judges may have learned in law school, mastered in legal practice, or picked up while serving as a judge. The skeptics of legal reasoning do not generally believe that lawyers and judges are lying. They do believe, however, that what lawyers and judges think they are doing—their internal view of their own activities— often masks a deeper reality, one in which policy choices and various other nonlegal attributes play a much larger role in explaining legal argu- ments and legal outcomes than even the participants themselves believe or understand. Insofar as this more skeptical picture accurately reflects reality, legal reasoning may be less distinctive and consequently less im- portant than many have thought. But if instead the traditional account is largely sound, and if lawyers and judges, even though they admittedly share many reasoning characteristics with their fellow humans, possess methods of thinking that are distinctively legal, then it is important to ex- plore just what those special characteristics and methods might be. Con- sequently, one way of approaching the alleged distinctiveness of legal rea- soning is to consider just how much of the reasoning of lawyers and judges is explained by their specialized training and roles, on the one hand, and just how much is explained simply by the fact that they are hu- man, on the other. 6 The claim that there is such a thing as legal reasoning is thus a (con- tested) hypothesis that lawyers have ways of approaching problems and making decisions that others do not. But just what are these ways? Some- times people argue that the special skill of the lawyer is a facility in deal- ing with facts and evidence, coupled with the related ability to under- stand the full context of a particular event, dispute, or decision. 7 Yet although these are important skills for good lawyers to have, it is not so clear that successful lawyers have or need them to a greater extent than successful police detectives, historians, psychiatrists, and anthropol- ogists. Similarly, others have sought to characterize legal reasoning in 4 THINKING LIKE A LAWYER 6. See Frederick Schauer, "Is There a Psychology of Judging?," in David E. Klein 26 Gregory Mitchell, The Psychology of Judicial Decision Making (forth- coming 2009). 7. See, e.g., Steven Burton, An Introduction to Law and Legal Reasoning (3d ed., 2005); Richard A. Bandstra, "Looking Toward Lansing: Could You Be a Law- yer/Legislator?," 89 Mich. B.J. 28 (2005); Martha Minow 26 Elizabeth Spelman, "In Context," 63 S. Cal. L. Rev. 1597 (1990). terms of a heightened ability to see the other side of an argument, 8 or, relatedly, of being empathetic to individuals and putting one’s self in the shoes of another, 9 but these too are attributes we expect to see in good thinkers and good people of all stripes. Indeed, even the oft-touted legal talent for reasoning by analogy 10 is hardly distinctive to lawyers and judges, for using analogies effectively may well be what distinguishes ex- perts from novices in almost any field of endeavor. 11 So yes, we would like lawyers and judges to be smart, sympathetic, analytic, rigorous, pre- cise, open-minded, and sensitive to factual nuance, among other things, but because these are also the traits we wish to have in our politicians, so- cial workers, physicians, and investment bankers, it is not yet so clear what skills or characteristics, if any, lawyers are supposed to have that others do not. The chapters in this book are dedicated to exploring the various forms of reasoning that have traditionally been especially associated with the legal system, such as making decisions according to rules, treating certain sources as authoritative, respecting precedent even when it ap- pears to dictate the wrong outcome, being sensitive to burdens of proof, and being attuned to questions of decision-making jurisdiction—under- standing that it is one thing to recognize a correct outcome but another to realize that some institutions might be empowered to reach that out- come while others are not. But we should not at the outset set up unreal- istic aspirations for legal reasoning’s claim to distinctiveness. In the first place, law cannot plausibly be seen as a closed system, in the way that games like chess might be. All of the moves of a game of chess can be found in the rules of chess, but not all of the moves in legal argument and 5 INTRODUCTION: IS THERE LEGAL REASONING? 8.

Sunstein, Legal Reasoning and Political Conflict (1996); Lloyd Weinreb, Legal Reason: The Use of Analogy in Legal Argument (2005). 11. See, e.g., Kenneth D. Forbus, "Exploring Analogy in the Large," in The An- alogical Mind: Perspectives from Cognitive Science 23 (Kenneth D. Forbus, Keith J. Holyoak, 26 Boris N. Kokinov eds., 2001); Keith J. Holyoak, "Analogy," in The Cambridge Handbook of Thinking and Reasoning 117 (Keith J. Holyoak 26 Rob- ert J. Morrison eds., 2005). legal decision-making can be found in the rules of law. 12 Not only does law of necessity depend on numerous skills other than those explicitly understood to be legal, but law is inevitably and especially subject to the unforeseeable complexity of the human condition. We can at best imper- fectly predict the future, just as we continue to be uncertain about what we will do with that future once we get there. As the world continues to throw the unexpected at us, law will find itself repeatedly forced to go outside of the existing rules in order to serve the society in which it ex- ists. Law may well contain within its arsenal of argument and decision- making the resources it needs to adapt to a changing world, but insofar as that is the case, it is even less likely that the image of a totally closed system in which existing rules of law—and maybe even the existing prac- tices of legal argument—will be an accurate picture of what law does and how it does it. Not only is law not a closed system, but its characteristic methods of reasoning, if indeed there are such methods, are also not ones that are completely unique to law. Perhaps there is little overlap between Esto- nian and English, or between literary criticism and multivariate calculus, but it is not plausible to deny that even the most characteristic forms of legal reasoning are found outside the legal system. It is true that lawyers and judges frequently make arguments and decisions based on the dic- tates of written-down rules, but so do bureaucrats, bankers, and every one of us when we observe the speed limit written on a sign. The legal system also seems particularly concerned with precedent—with doing the same thing that has been done before just because it has been done be- fore. But this form of thinking is again hardly unique to law, as is well known to parents when dealing with the argument by a younger child that he or she should be allowed to do something at a certain age only be- cause an older sibling was allowed to do the same thing at that age. And although law is also an institution characterized by authority-based rea- soning—taking the source of a directive rather than the reasons behind it as a justification for following it—this too is hardly unknown outside of the legal system. The family is again a good example, and every parent who has ever in exasperation exclaimed "Because I said so21" to a stub- 6 THINKING LIKE A LAWYER 12. For a well-known denial that law can possibly be seen as a closed and deductive system, see H.L.A. Hart, "Positivism and the Separation of Law and Morals," 71 Harv. L. Rev. 593, 608 (1958). born child recognizes that appeals to authority rather than reason have their place throughout human existence. Yet although the characteristic modes of legal reasoning are all fre- quently found outside the law, it might still be that these forms of rea- soning and decision-making are particularly concentrated in the legal system. For however much these various forms of reasoning do exist throughout our decision-making lives, it is important not to forget that they are odd, and odd in a special way. And this special oddness is that every one of the dominant characteristics of legal reasoning and legal ar- gument can be seen as a route toward reaching a decision other than the best all-things-considered decision for the matter at hand. Often when we obey a speed limit we are driving at a speed that is not the same as what we think is the best speed given the traffic, the driving conditions, and our own driving skills. Consequently, to obey a speed limit is to do something we do not think best. Similarly, making a decision just because the same decision has been made before—following precedent—gets in- teresting primarily when we would otherwise have made a different deci- sion. The parent who gives the younger child the same privileges at the same age as an older child feels the pull of precedent only when he or she otherwise thinks there is a good reason for treating the two differently, and so being constrained by precedent is again a path away from what had otherwise seemed to be the right decision. And we say we are obey- ing or following an authority only if what we are doing because of what the authority has said is not the same as what we would have done if left to our own devices to make the decision we thought best. The soldier who follows an order might well do something else if allowed to make his or her own unguided (or uncommanded) decision, just as the obedi- ent student or child is one who suppresses his or her own desires to do something else. Once we understand that these admittedly common forms of reason- ing and decision-making are nevertheless somewhat peculiar—that they often dictate outcomes other than those the decision-maker would other- wise have chosen—we can understand as well that the substantial pres- ence of these forms of reasoning in the legal system—more substantial, proportionately, than in the totality of our decision-making lives—can provide the foundation for a plausible claim that there is such a thing as legal reasoning. If these somewhat counterintuitive forms of reasoning— forms of reasoning that often lead to results other than what would oth- 7 INTRODUCTION: IS THERE LEGAL REASONING? erwise seem to be the best all-things-considered outcome for the case at hand—are dominant in law but somewhat more exceptional elsewhere, then we might be able to conclude that there is such a thing as legal rea- soning, that there is something we might label "thinking like a lawyer," and that there is accordingly something that it is vitally important that lawyers and judges know how to do well and that law schools must teach their students. To repeat, this array of reasoning methods is not unique to the legal system, and these are not the only methods that the law uses. The modes of legal reasoning are found elsewhere, and the modes of what we might call "ordinary" reasoning have a large place in legal argu- ment and legal decision-making. But if it turns out that there are indeed methods of reasoning that are found everywhere but that are particularly concentrated and dominant in legal argument and decision-making, then the claim that there is something called legal reasoning will turn out to be justified. Law’s seemingly counterintuitive methods are not simply a historical peculiarity. Rather, they are a function of law’s inherent generality. Al- though disputes, in court and out, involve particular people with particu- lar problems engaged in particular controversies, the law tends to treat the particulars it confronts as members of larger categories. Rather than attempting to reach the best result for each controversy in a wholly particularistic and contextual way, law’s goal is often to make sure that the outcome for all or at least most of the particulars in a given category is the right one. Once again Lord Coke is illuminating: "It is better saith the Law to suffer a mischiefe (that is particular to one) than an inconve- nience that may prejudice many." 13 In other words, for Coke it was better to reach the wrong result in the particular controversy than to adopt a rule that would produce what would seem to be the correct result for this case but at the cost of producing the wrong result in many others. Coke’s lesson can be observed in the traditional ritual of Socratic dialogue 14 that takes place between student and teacher in the first year 8 THINKING LIKE A LAWYER 13. Sir Edward Coke, as quoted in J.R. Stoner, Common Law and Liberal The- ory: Coke, Hobbes, and the Origins of American Constitutionalism 25 (1992). 14. There is scant connection between the question-centered methods of teach- ing employed by Socrates in the Platonic dialogues and the type of questioning that has traditionally taken place in the law school classroom. Even apart from the enormous advantage that Plato had over the rest of us in being able to write the an- swers as well as the questions, Socrates’ goal was to extract from his interlocutors some latent but nonspecialized insight, rather than to inculcate in them a special- of law school. After eventually being coaxed into accurately reciting the facts of some reported case, the student is asked what she thinks should be the correct result for the present case. Typically, the student then re- sponds by announcing what she believes to be the fairest or most just outcome between the opposing positions of the particular parties. At this point the student is asked by her interrogator to give the rule or principle that would support this outcome, and here the characteristic pattern of Socratic inquiry begins. By a series of patterned and well-planned (and often well-worn) hypothetical examples, the professor challenges the stu- dent’s initially offered rule, with the aim of demonstrating that the rule that would generate a just or fair or efficient outcome in the present case would generate less just, less fair, or otherwise less satisfactory results in other cases. And in taking the chosen victim through this series of un- comfortable applications of her initially selected rule, the professor at- tempts to get all the students in the class to understand, just as Coke ar- gued, that the best legal rule may at times be one which will produce an unjust result in the present case but which will produce better results in a larger number of cases, the result in the present case notwithstanding. This form of Socratic inquiry is not restricted to the law school class- room, and it is noteworthy that it is the common form of judicial ques- tioning in appellate argument. Because appellate courts often see them- selves as pronouncing rules that will control other and future factual situations, and as writing opinions that will serve as precedents in subse- quent cases, appellate judges are often concerned as much with the effect of their immediate ruling on future cases as with reaching the best result in the present case. As a consequence, appellate advocates frequently find themselves asked in oral argument how the rule or result they are advo- cating will play out in various hypothetical situations. Just as in the law school classroom, judges pose these hypothetical scenarios to the lawyers who argue before them because of the belief that what seems initially to be the right result in the particular dispute before the court will wind up 9 INTRODUCTION: IS THERE LEGAL REASONING? as the actual outcome only if it can be justified in a way that will not pro- duce the wrong outcomes in too many expected future cases. In seeking to demonstrate to the hapless student or the struggling ad- vocate how the best legal outcome may be something other than the best outcome for the immediate controversy, the prototypical Socratic inter- rogation embodies law’s pervasive willingness to reach a result differing from the one that is optimally fair or maximally wise, all things consid- ered, in the particular case. In United States v. Locke, 15 for example, the Supreme Court dealt with a case in which a renewal of a land claim that had been filed on December 31, 1982, had been rejected by the Bureau of Land Management because the relevant statute required that such filings be lodged "prior to December 31" of any given year. Although it seemed obvious to the Court and to virtually everyone else that the language of the statute was defective, and that what Congress really meant to say was "on or prior to December 31," Justice Thurgood Marshall and five other Justices concluded that the particular rights and wrongs of Locke’s own claim were less important than the larger question whether the Supreme Court should be in the business of rewriting even obviously mistaken fed- eral statutes, especially ones dealing with deadlines and filing dates. Here and elsewhere, law is typically concerned with the full array of applica- tions of some general rule and principle, and as a result the law often pur- sues that concern at the cost of being less worried than nonlegal decision- makers might be with a possible error or injustice or unfairness in the particular case. When the Rule of Law is described, as it traditionally was, in contrast to the rule of men, the idea was that the Rule of Law was a principle that was wary of individual judgment and reluctant to rely too heavily on the unguided judgments and whims of particular people. So although it may sometimes seem unfair to take the existence of a clear rule or a clear precedent as commanding a result the judge herself thinks wrong, following even a rule or precedent perceived by the judge to be er- roneous is what, under the traditional understanding, the law often ex- pects its decision-makers to do. 16</p><h4 id="HOurrulesbasedapproachisnecessarytodevelopanalogicalreasoning" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Our rules based approach is necessary to develop analogical reasoning</span></h4><p>Danny <strong>Priel</strong>, Oscar M.

In large part this may have been because these fields, including Middle East studies as practiced in the United States, were by the 1990s not what they had been 30 years earlier. The sharp decline (within academia, at least) of once dominant paradigms like a cultural-essentialist Orientalism and modernization theory resulted in the dissipation of the intellectual coherence that had characterized the field in its first decades. But the kind of intellectual fragmentation that had come to characterize Middle East studies was the norm across a great many other fields and disciplines and was counterbalanced, probably even outweighed, by the fact that many Middle East specialists, perhaps especially younger scholars, were now not only well versed in the theoretical and methodological issues and debates of their own disciplines but also routinely engaged with innovative work that cut across or transcended disciplinary boundaries. They could thus increasingly manage, without any great difficulty, to participate in productive scholarly conversations not only with their disciplinary colleagues (fellow historians, political scientists, anthropologists, literature specialists, etc.) but also with scholars from other disciplines interested in this part of the world and in others as well. &nbsp;Moreover, because so many scholars working on the Middle East were participants in the scholarly conversations and debates that had transformed broad segments of the humanities and the social sciences in recent decades, Middle East studies had to a considerable extent overcome its ~End Page 73~ insular and rather backward character and was now much more open to, and engaged with, the wider intellectual world than had once been the case. The developments of the last two or three decades, including the critiques of Orientalism and modernization theory; the broad range of new work on colonialism; innovative approaches to historical, social, and cultural analysis influenced by critical anthropology; and, more broadly, heightened interaction among disciplines and fields had given many within Middle East studies a new set of common languages that facilitated productive intellectual exchange.3 This was also a much more intellectually and politically self-aware and self-critical field than was once the case. As a result, the best of the new work in this field was by the beginning of the twenty-first century very much on a par with the best produced in other area studies fields, and scholars specializing in the Middle East were being read and listened to by scholars specializing in other parts of the world as never before.4 &nbsp;In conjunction with a generally higher level of mastery of relevant languages and the use of innovative theoretical and methodological approaches, scholars in the field were by the late twentieth century also making use of a broader range of sources than in the past. A case in point is work on the history of the Arab provinces of the Ottoman empire. Students and scholars with a command of both Arabic and Ottoman Turkish made increasing use not only of the vast Ottoman imperial archives in Istanbul but also of local Islamic court records and family papers, along with more traditional sources like the writings of European consuls and travelers, to produce portraits of social, political, economic, and cultural life in these lands in the last four hundred years of Ottoman rule of unprecedented depth and complexity.5 &nbsp;These studies helped to undermine what was once conventional wisdom in late Ottoman history, that these lands were economically, socially, and culturally stagnant before Napoleon’s army landed in Egypt in 1798; that they were uniformly characterized by despotism, the oppressive and retrograde imposition of Islamic law, and the rigorous segregation and subordination of non-Muslims; and that all real change was induced by contact with the West. Instead, the newer scholarship began to elucidate indigenous sources and dynamics of change while also showing how this ~End Page 74~ region was part of the broader sweep of world history long before the nineteenth century and the onset of westernization or modernization as conventionally understood. As a result of these scholarly advances, Ottoman historians often came to have much broader and more fully comparative perspectives than historians of early modern Europe, many of whom had only recently come to understand that they needed to overcome their own provincialism by addressing the ways in which developments in Europe were not utterly sui generis but often were bound up with larger patterns and dynamics of change that affected large stretches of Eurasia. &nbsp;&nbsp;Scholars and the State &nbsp;If the preceding assessment is accurate, it is fair to say that the changes that transformed Middle East studies in the United States over the last several decades of the twentieth century made it a more intellectually productive and interesting scholarly field. However, this development was accompanied by a growing gap between academics studying the Middle East and the officials, agencies, and institutions of the U.S. government, and a corresponding decline in the influence of university-based scholars on the shaping of foreign policy and on the media, the main purveyor of information, images, and attitudes about the region to the broad public. &nbsp;For one, a good many (though by no means all) students and scholars in this field were less than happy with U.S. government policies toward the Middle East in the 1980s and beyond. Hard evidence is lacking, but it is probably safe to suggest that much of the membership of the Middle East Studies Association, the field’s main professional organization, was not enthusiastic about U.S. support for Saddam Hussein’s regime in its war against Iran in the 1980s, the U.S.-led Gulf War of 1991, the sanctions regime imposed on Iraq thereafter, the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, or, more broadly, the extent to which successive U.S. administrations countenanced Israel’s ongoing occupation of the West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem; its continuing implantation of Jewish settlements there; and its rejection of a Palestinian state in those territories as endorsed by virtually the entire international community. There was a widespread (though never universal) ~End Page 75~ sense that the policies pursued by the United States in the Middle East were hindering, rather than contributing to, peace, democracy, human rights, development, and progress in the region. &nbsp;This disaffection from official policy and the premises that underpinned it did not mean that U.S.-based scholars studying the Middle East were unwilling to share their perspectives on, and try to influence, U.S. policy toward the region. In fact, many devoted a great deal of time and effort to trying to educate the broader public through informal meetings, lectures, articles, op-ed pieces, radio and television interviews, and the like, and to convey their views to elected officials; not a few were also quite willing to meet with State Department and intelligence agency personnel. It is rather that the shared vision of the world, and of the place of the United States within it, that had once linked the world of academia with the world of policymaking had faded, and many scholars no longer spoke the same language as policymakers. &nbsp;Adding to this sense of distance and alienation was a new and much more critical understanding of the proper relationship between scholars and the state—not a surprising development in the aftermath of a period in which the pernicious ends to which scholarly knowledge could be put had been made all too visible, in Vietnam but elsewhere as well. In the first decades of the Cold War a good many scholars in this as in other area studies fields, especially social scientists working on contemporary issues, saw no problem with conducting research on behalf of the government and cooperating with intelligence agencies because they were all part of the good fight against Communism. By the 1980s those who were assuming the leadership in U.S. Middle East studies were by and large much more wary about their sources of funding and the ends to which their training and research, and that of their students, might be put. Fewer scholars were willing to allow what they knew about the region to be used in the service of a state about whose policies they were often at least dubious, for example, by conducting research for agencies like the CIA or by encouraging promising students to enter government service. There developed a widespread sense that to allow one’s research agenda to be determined by the needs of the state or to serve potentially pernicious ends was not only a betrayal of one’s ~End Page 76~ integrity as a scholar but might also compromise one’s ability to conduct research in the Middle East, where by the 1980s real or alleged CIA connections had gotten Americans and others denounced, kidnapped, or worse. &nbsp;At issue was not government funding per se: since the passage of the National Defense Education Act in 1958, a great many students and scholars working on the Middle East had happily made use of NDFL/FLAS and other government fellowships for language training, graduate study, and research. A large proportion of the budgets of the centers for Middle East studies at universities around the country also came from the federal government. But because this individual and institutional funding came through the U.S. Department of Education it was deemed ethically and politically acceptable even by those who most vociferously disagreed with U.S. government policies in the Middle East. Similarly, additional government funding for graduate student and faculty research on the Middle East first made available by the 1992 Near and Middle East Research and Training Act—originally channeled through the Social Science Research Council and later through the Council of American Overseas Research Centers—was not seen as posing a problem because the funding was allocated first through the U.S. Information Agency and then through the State Department budget. &nbsp;The real issue was which part of the U.S. government was supplying the funding, for what ends, and with what conditions. As early as 1985 the Middle East Studies Association had asked "university-based international studies programs to refrain from responding to requests for research contract proposals from the Defense Academic Research Support Program ~established by the Defense Department to fund academic research on issues of interest to the military~ or from other intelligence entities and call~ed~ upon its members to reflect carefully upon their responsibilities to the academic profession prior to seeking or accepting funding from intelligence sources."6 Some years later MESA also criticized the new National Security Education Program (NSEP), created by the National Security Education Act of 1991. The NSEP sought to bolster the teaching of "less commonly taught" languages (including Arabic, Persian, and Turkish), thereby enabling (as the ~End Page 77~ program’s website put it) "the nation to remain integrally involved in global issues related to U.S. National Security" as well as to "develop a cadre of professionals with more than the traditional knowledge of language and culture who can use this ability to help the U.S. make sound decisions on and deal effectively with global issues related to U.S. National Security" (see the NSEP website at <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.iie.org/programs/nsep/nsephome.htm).  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.iie.org/programs/nsep/nsephome.htm).%27" tppabs="http://www.iie.org/programs/nsep/nsephome.htm)."><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.iie.org/programs/nsep/nsephome.htm).</span></a></span> Unlike other programs funding research and training on the Middle East, the NSEP was housed in the Department of Defense, intelligence agency officials sat on its oversight board, and recipients of the funding it offered were required to work for a government agency involved in national security affairs after their fellowship or scholarship was completed. In a 1993 resolution endorsed by a referendum of its membership, MESA joined with the African Studies Association and the Latin American Studies Association to "deplore the location of responsibility in the U.S. defense and intelligence community for a major foreign area research, education, and training program. . . . This connection can only increase the existing difficulties of gaining foreign governmental permissions to carry out research and to develop overseas instructional programs. It can also create dangers for students and scholars by fostering the perception of involvement in military or intelligence activities, and may limit academic freedom." MESA called on the government to establish a peer and merit review process for funding applications that would be independent of military, intelligence, and foreign policy agencies and to broaden the service requirement so that it would include a much wider range of jobs, including those outside government service. &nbsp;Until its concerns were met, MESA urged that "its members and their institutions not seek or accept program or research funding from NSEA...." Three years later MESA adopted yet another resolution reiterating its rejection of NSEP because the law appropriating funding for the program now required that all fellowship recipients agree to work for the Defense Department or some intelligence agency for at least two years or else repay the cost of their fellowship (see the NSEP website, as well as the MESA resolutions site at <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://w3fp.arizona.edu/mesassoc/resolutions.htm).  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://w3fp.arizona.edu/mesassoc/resolutions.htm).%27" tppabs="http://w3fp.arizona.edu/mesassoc/resolutions.htm)."><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://w3fp.arizona.edu/mesassoc/resolutions.htm).</span></a></span> (This last requirement was later relaxed somewhat so that recipients who ~End Page 78~ could not find employment with a national security agency despite a "good faith effort" to do so could fulfill the service requirement by working in higher education.) MESA would voice the same concerns about other outgrowths of the NSEP, for example, the 2002 National Flagship Language Initiative–Pilot Program (NFLI-P), launched to address what were seen as America’s extraordinary deficiencies in languages critical to national security. Many (though by no means all) Middle East studies faculty adopted MESA’s perspective on this issue, declining to seek NSEP funding for themselves or their institutions. &nbsp;The disinclination by MESA and many of its individual and institutional members to cooperate with the government in ways that had been common in the 1950s and 1960s was certainly not shared by everyone in the field. Yet it is instructive that when in the 1980s reports surfaced of questionable links between academics and intelligence agencies, the most vocal response among scholars in the field was condemnation. A case in point is the scandal surrounding Nadav Safran, a political scientist whose first book set forth an analysis of modern Egyptian history informed by modernization theory and who by the mid-1980s was director of Harvard University’s Center for Middle Eastern Studies. The scandal erupted when it became known that Safran had taken 2445,700 from the Central Intelligence Agency to fund a major international conference he was hosting at Harvard on "Islam and Politics in the Contemporary Muslim World"—a hot topic at the time and one of obvious interest to the CIA. Not only had Safran secretly used CIA funding for this conference, he had not told the invitees, a number of whom were coming from the Middle East, that the CIA was picking up the tab. It then came out that Safran had also received a 24107,430 grant from the CIA for the research project that led to his 1985 book Saudi Arabia: The Ceaseless Request for Security. Safran’s contract with the CIA stipulated that the agency had the right to review and approve the manuscript before publication and that its role in funding the book would not be disclosed. And indeed, the book as published made no mention of the fact that the research for it had been partially funded by the CIA. &nbsp;When the scandal broke, about half the invitees to Safran’s conference withdrew, and many of the faculty and students associated with Harvard’s ~End Page 79~ Center for Middle Eastern Studies publicly expressed their opposition to Safran’s actions. A month later the Middle East Studies Association censured Safran on the grounds that his actions had violated its 1982 resolution calling on scholars to disclose their sources of research funding. Safran intimated that his critics were motivated by anti-Semitism, but after an internal investigation at Harvard he agreed to step down as center director at the end of the academic year.7 Safran was surely not the only academic to have secretly or openly solicited or accepted funding from an intelligence agency for his research in this period, and no doubt such relationships persisted long after this scandal, but the reaction to it—unimaginable in the early decades of U.S. Middle East studies—does indicate how the relationship between academia and the state had changed. Think Tanks and Talking Heads &nbsp;But there was a price to be paid for the gap that had opened up between the world of Middle East scholarship and the world of policymaking. If many college- and university-based academics no longer entirely shared the worldview that prevailed in Washington or no longer felt the need to shape their research agenda so that it was relevant to the policies that flowed from that worldview, there were others who stood ready to meet the demand for knowledge that would serve the state. Many of these were based not in institutions of higher education but in the host of think tanks that had proliferated from the 1970s onward—privately funded institutions oriented toward the production and dissemination of knowledge designed to inform and influence public policy, for our purposes mainly the foreign policy of the United States. &nbsp;Some of these institutions and organizations went back a long way. The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, for example, was founded in 1910 to advance international cooperation, while the Council on Foreign Relations, publisher of the influential journal Foreign Affairs, was established in 1921, originally as a sort of elite dinner club. The liberal Brookings Institution was established in 1927, supported by Carnegie and Rockefeller funding, while the conservative American Enterprise Institute was founded ~End Page 80~ in 1943 to promote "limited government," "free enterprise," and a "strong foreign policy and national defense." After the Second World War, contractors like the huge RAND Corporation entered the field to produce or fund research for the military and intelligence and other government agencies concerned with foreign policy. Another wave beginning in the 1960s had witnessed the establishment of a large number of what one observer called "advocacy" think tanks, like the Center for Strategic and International Studies (1962), the Heritage Foundation (1973), and the Cato Institute (1977), which combined "policy research with aggressive marketing techniques" as they struggled to secure funding and influence in an increasingly competitive marketplace. There are now also many "legacy-based" institutions, like the Carter Center in Atlanta and the Nixon Center for Peace and Freedom in Washington, D.C. By the end of the twentieth century there were an estimated 2,000 organizations engaged in policy analysis based in the United States, a substantial proportion of them focused on foreign policy and international relations.8 The 1970s also witnessed the establishment of what Lisa Anderson called "a new generation of professional graduate schools of public policy," many of whose graduates went on to work for policy-oriented think tanks rather than in colleges and universities (Anderson 2000, 21). &nbsp;The Middle East was a relative backwater for the think tank industry until the 1980s. The Middle East Institute, founded in 1946, published a journal and organized conferences but exercised relatively little political clout. By contrast, the Washington Institute for Near East Policy (WINEP), founded in 1985, quickly achieved a much higher profile and much greater influence. Describing itself as "a public educational foundation dedicated to scholarly research and informed debate on U.S. interests in the Middle East,"9 WINEP emerged as the leading pro-Israel think tank in Washington. Its founding director, Martin Indyk, had previously worked at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), founded in 1959 and by the 1970s by far the most well-funded, visible, and effective pro-Israel lobbying organization.10 &nbsp;Indyk and his colleagues at WINEP worked hard to strengthen Israel’s standing in Washington as the key U.S. ally in the Middle East and to ensure ~End Page 81~ that U.S. policy in the region coincided with the policies and strategies of the Israeli government. During the late 1980s and early 1990s this meant trying to foil U.S. recognition of the PLO and U.S. pressure on Israel to halt settlement activity in the West Bank and Gaza and enter serious negotiations. In the 1990s WINEP expanded its purview to encompass the entire Middle East, but its focus always remained on Israel, for which it tried to build support by arguing that Israel and the United States faced a common threat from Islamic radicalism and terrorism, defined rather broadly to encompass virtually all of Israel’s enemies, state and nonstate. Various other think tanks also began or stepped up research and advocacy on Middle East issues in the late 1990s and early 2000s. These included the Haim Saban Center for Middle East Policy, launched by the Brookings Institution in 2002, and the conservative American Enterprise Institute. &nbsp;During the Clinton administration a substantial number of WINEP alumni served in key foreign policy positions, including Martin Indyk himself, appointed as special assistant to the president and senior director for Near East and South Asian affairs at the National Security Council and, later, as U.S. ambassador to Israel. They and other Clinton administration officials promulgated the policy of "dual containment," whereby the United States would seek to isolate, and if possible eliminate, the governments of both Iraq and Iran, not coincidentally perceived as two of Israel’s most serious enemies. By the late 1990s, however, WINEP would itself be outflanked by newer rivals that unlike WINEP openly aligned themselves with the stances of the Israeli right (or even far right) and argued for aggressive U.S. action against Israel’s enemies, including the overthrow of the regime of Saddam Hussein in Iraq. &nbsp;The policies these and other explicitly right-wing think tanks advocated during the Clinton years, when they were in the political wilderness, were initially regarded as extreme and outlandish. But many of them would eventually be adopted by the George W. Bush administration, in which their architects assumed key posts. Among them were Vice President Richard Cheney; Defense Policy Board member (and for a time chair) Richard Perle, a key advocate of war against Iraq; Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz; Undersecretary of State John Bolton; and Undersecretary ~End Page 82~ of Defense Douglas Feith. Before assuming power these (people) men and their colleagues had, through such right-wing organizations as the Project for a New American Century and the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs, called for the use of U.S. military power to dominate the world, massive increases in military spending, and unequivocal support for the policies of the Israeli right.11 After the attacks of September 11, 2001, President George W. Bush openly embraced much of their agenda, tacitly supporting Israel’s effort to crush the Palestinian uprising by force and in March-April 2003 invading and occupying Iraq. &nbsp;The first years of the twenty-first century thus witnessed an unprecedented convergence in positions of supreme power in Washington of right-wing (and in some cases Christian fundamentalist) zealots and neo-conservative American Jews united by a common vision of securing permanent and unchallengeable U.S. global hegemony, with a strong focus on the Middle East and a close embrace of Israel, a vision to be achieved by military force if necessary. The war against Iraq was in a sense the pilot project for this radical vision. As Michael Ledeen, in 2003 "resident scholar in the Freedom Chair" at the American Enterprise Institute and long a fixture among right-wing foreign-policy activists, was reported to have put it, crudely but not inaccurately: "Every ten years or so, the United States needs to pick up some small crappy little country and throw it against the wall, just to show the world we mean business" (Goldberg 2002). More specifically, a reconstructed, oil-rich Iraq was seen as a valuable new base for U.S. power in the Middle East, enabling the United States to terminate its problematic relationship with Saudi Arabia and compel the Arabs (including the Palestinians) to make peace with Israel on the latter’s terms. That the vast majority of the international community, including a great many Americans, vehemently rejected the use of military force to achieve this vision made no difference whatsoever to its advocates.12 &nbsp;There were certainly voices raised, in academia, the think tank world, and elsewhere, in opposition to this agenda and the understanding of the world that underpinned it, as there had been voices offering alternative views about U.S. policy toward the Middle East at other critical junctures. But during the 1980s, 1990s, and early years of the twenty-first century ~End Page 83~ these voices received relatively little attention, and university-based scholars seemed to play a decreasing role in influencing foreign policy. Critics of U.S. foreign policy also found it difficult to make themselves heard through the mass media. It is striking that the great bulk of the "talking heads" who appeared on television to offer their opinions on the 1990–91 Gulf crisis, on the 2003 Iraq war, and on other issues relating to the Middle East and U.S. policy toward it seemed to come not from academia but from professional pundits, from people associated with think tanks or with one of the public policy schools, and from retired military personnel. Whatever their knowledge (or lack thereof) of the languages, politics, histories, and cultures of the Middle East, these people spoke the language and shared the mindset of the Washington foreign policy world in a way few university-based scholars did. They were also used to communicating their perspective in effective sound bites, whereas academics were often put off by the ignorance and political conformism of much (though by no means all) of American mass media journalism and its tendency to crudely oversimplify complex issues and transform everything (even war) into a form of entertainment. &nbsp;This helped bring about a considerable narrowing of the perspectives available to the public and the consolidation of a powerful, indeed almost impenetrable, consensus about the Middle East that encompassed most of the political class and the punditocracy. Republicans and Democrats argued mainly over how best to maintain U.S. hegemony in the region, leaving very little room for those who envisioned a fundamentally different foreign policy founded on peace, democracy, human rights, mutual security, multilateral disarmament, nonintervention, and respect for international law. It is, however, worth noting that despite the virtual absence of such views in the mass media, they were embraced by a good many Americans, as evidenced by the massive demonstrations that preceded the U.S. attack on Iraq in March 2003 and the polls that indicated substantial public opposition to war, partly because of the new modes and channels of communication and organizing made possible by the Internet. &nbsp;Nonetheless, in the aftermath of September 11th, critical (and even moderate) voices were largely drowned out by the right, which quickly and effectively moved to implement its global agenda by exploiting public ~End Page 84~ outrage against the Islamist extremists who had perpetrated the September 11th attacks. They succeeded in "selling" first military intervention in Afghanistan (justified by the fact that the Taliban regime had allowed al-Qa’ida to operate in that country and refused to hand over those responsible for organizing the September 11th attacks) and then war against Iraq, even though no one was able to produce any credible evidence that the regime of Saddam Hussein had had anything to do with the September 11th attacks or still possessed weapons of mass destruction. In this effort conservative scholars like Bernard Lewis played a significant part, graphically illustrating their continuing, even enhanced, clout in right-wing policymaking circles long after their standing in scholarly circles had declined, as well as the durability and power of some very old Orientalist notions many had mistakenly thought dead as a doornail.</p><h4 id="HFocusoncreatingsafespacesmisdiagnosestheproblemandshiftfocusawayfromeffectiveeffortstochallengebroaderstructuresofpower2013theirpoliticsoftheselfrefocusesontheindividualcreatingacolonialistconceptionofthesubject." class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Focus on creating safe spaces misdiagnoses the problem and shift focus away from effective efforts to challenge broader structures of power – their politics of the self refocuses on the individual creating a colonialist conception of the subject.</span></h4><p>Andrea <strong>Smith</strong>, intellectual, feminist, and anti-violence activist, <strong>2013</strong>, The Problem with "Privilege," <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://anarchalibrary.blogspot.com/2013/08/the-problem-with-privilege-2013.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://anarchalibrary.blogspot.com/2013/08/the-problem-with-privilege-2013.html%27" tppabs="http://anarchalibrary.blogspot.com/2013/08/the-problem-with-privilege-2013.html"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://anarchalibrary.blogspot.com/2013/08/the-problem-with-privilege-2013.html</span></a></span><br/>This kind of politics then challenges the notions of "safe space" often prevalent <br/>AND<br/>open ourselves to new possibilities that we cannot imagine now for the future.&nbsp;</p><h4 id="HWe2019renotpro-State2Cbutwe2019re22anti-anti-statist222013SomethingscanONLYbesolved22throughthesystem22.Restrictingdroneauthorityisaninstanceofthat." class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>We’re not pro-State, but we’re "anti-anti-statist" – Some things can ONLY be solved "through the system".

The Neo-conservative Assault on Middle East Studies" CR: The New Centennial Review 5.1 (2005) 63-110<br/>It may be too soon to tell, but from the vantage point of the first years of the twenty-first century it would seem that area studies has weathered the storms of the immediate post–Cold War period. In large part this may have been because these fields, including Middle East studies as practiced in the United States, were by the 1990s not what they had been 30 years earlier. The sharp decline (within academia, at least) of once dominant paradigms like a cultural-essentialist Orientalism and modernization theory resulted in the dissipation of the intellectual coherence that had characterized the field in its first decades. But the kind of intellectual fragmentation that had come to characterize Middle East studies was the norm across a great many other fields and disciplines and was counterbalanced, probably even outweighed, by the fact that many Middle East specialists, perhaps especially younger scholars, were now not only well versed in the theoretical and methodological issues and debates of their own disciplines but also routinely engaged with innovative work that cut across or transcended disciplinary boundaries. They could thus increasingly manage, without any great difficulty, to participate in productive scholarly conversations not only with their disciplinary colleagues (fellow historians, political scientists, anthropologists, literature specialists, etc.) but also with scholars from other disciplines interested in this part of the world and in others as well. &nbsp;Moreover, because so many scholars working on the Middle East were participants in the scholarly conversations and debates that had transformed broad segments of the humanities and the social sciences in recent decades, Middle East studies had to a considerable extent overcome its ~End Page 73~ insular and rather backward character and was now much more open to, and engaged with, the wider intellectual world than had once been the case. The developments of the last two or three decades, including the critiques of Orientalism and modernization theory; the broad range of new work on colonialism; innovative approaches to historical, social, and cultural analysis influenced by critical anthropology; and, more broadly, heightened interaction among disciplines and fields had given many within Middle East studies a new set of common languages that facilitated productive intellectual exchange.3 This was also a much more intellectually and politically self-aware and self-critical field than was once the case. As a result, the best of the new work in this field was by the beginning of the twenty-first century very much on a par with the best produced in other area studies fields, and scholars specializing in the Middle East were being read and listened to by scholars specializing in other parts of the world as never before.4 &nbsp;In conjunction with a generally higher level of mastery of relevant languages and the use of innovative theoretical and methodological approaches, scholars in the field were by the late twentieth century also making use of a broader range of sources than in the past. A case in point is work on the history of the Arab provinces of the Ottoman empire. Students and scholars with a command of both Arabic and Ottoman Turkish made increasing use not only of the vast Ottoman imperial archives in Istanbul but also of local Islamic court records and family papers, along with more traditional sources like the writings of European consuls and travelers, to produce portraits of social, political, economic, and cultural life in these lands in the last four hundred years of Ottoman rule of unprecedented depth and complexity.5 &nbsp;These studies helped to undermine what was once conventional wisdom in late Ottoman history, that these lands were economically, socially, and culturally stagnant before Napoleon’s army landed in Egypt in 1798; that they were uniformly characterized by despotism, the oppressive and retrograde imposition of Islamic law, and the rigorous segregation and subordination of non-Muslims; and that all real change was induced by contact with the West. Instead, the newer scholarship began to elucidate indigenous sources and dynamics of change while also showing how this ~End Page 74~ region was part of the broader sweep of world history long before the nineteenth century and the onset of westernization or modernization as conventionally understood. As a result of these scholarly advances, Ottoman historians often came to have much broader and more fully comparative perspectives than historians of early modern Europe, many of whom had only recently come to understand that they needed to overcome their own provincialism by addressing the ways in which developments in Europe were not utterly sui generis but often were bound up with larger patterns and dynamics of change that affected large stretches of Eurasia. &nbsp;&nbsp;Scholars and the State &nbsp;If the preceding assessment is accurate, it is fair to say that the changes that transformed Middle East studies in the United States over the last several decades of the twentieth century made it a more intellectually productive and interesting scholarly field. However, this development was accompanied by a growing gap between academics studying the Middle East and the officials, agencies, and institutions of the U.S. government, and a corresponding decline in the influence of university-based scholars on the shaping of foreign policy and on the media, the main purveyor of information, images, and attitudes about the region to the broad public. &nbsp;For one, a good many (though by no means all) students and scholars in this field were less than happy with U.S. government policies toward the Middle East in the 1980s and beyond. Hard evidence is lacking, but it is probably safe to suggest that much of the membership of the Middle East Studies Association, the field’s main professional organization, was not enthusiastic about U.S. support for Saddam Hussein’s regime in its war against Iran in the 1980s, the U.S.-led Gulf War of 1991, the sanctions regime imposed on Iraq thereafter, the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, or, more broadly, the extent to which successive U.S. administrations countenanced Israel’s ongoing occupation of the West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem; its continuing implantation of Jewish settlements there; and its rejection of a Palestinian state in those territories as endorsed by virtually the entire international community. There was a widespread (though never universal) ~End Page 75~ sense that the policies pursued by the United States in the Middle East were hindering, rather than contributing to, peace, democracy, human rights, development, and progress in the region. &nbsp;This disaffection from official policy and the premises that underpinned it did not mean that U.S.-based scholars studying the Middle East were unwilling to share their perspectives on, and try to influence, U.S. policy toward the region. In fact, many devoted a great deal of time and effort to trying to educate the broader public through informal meetings, lectures, articles, op-ed pieces, radio and television interviews, and the like, and to convey their views to elected officials; not a few were also quite willing to meet with State Department and intelligence agency personnel. It is rather that the shared vision of the world, and of the place of the United States within it, that had once linked the world of academia with the world of policymaking had faded, and many scholars no longer spoke the same language as policymakers. &nbsp;Adding to this sense of distance and alienation was a new and much more critical understanding of the proper relationship between scholars and the state—not a surprising development in the aftermath of a period in which the pernicious ends to which scholarly knowledge could be put had been made all too visible, in Vietnam but elsewhere as well. In the first decades of the Cold War a good many scholars in this as in other area studies fields, especially social scientists working on contemporary issues, saw no problem with conducting research on behalf of the government and cooperating with intelligence agencies because they were all part of the good fight against Communism. By the 1980s those who were assuming the leadership in U.S. Middle East studies were by and large much more wary about their sources of funding and the ends to which their training and research, and that of their students, might be put. Fewer scholars were willing to allow what they knew about the region to be used in the service of a state about whose policies they were often at least dubious, for example, by conducting research for agencies like the CIA or by encouraging promising students to enter government service. There developed a widespread sense that to allow one’s research agenda to be determined by the needs of the state or to serve potentially pernicious ends was not only a betrayal of one’s ~End Page 76~ integrity as a scholar but might also compromise one’s ability to conduct research in the Middle East, where by the 1980s real or alleged CIA connections had gotten Americans and others denounced, kidnapped, or worse. &nbsp;At issue was not government funding per se: since the passage of the National Defense Education Act in 1958, a great many students and scholars working on the Middle East had happily made use of NDFL/FLAS and other government fellowships for language training, graduate study, and research. A large proportion of the budgets of the centers for Middle East studies at universities around the country also came from the federal government. But because this individual and institutional funding came through the U.S. Department of Education it was deemed ethically and politically acceptable even by those who most vociferously disagreed with U.S. government policies in the Middle East. Similarly, additional government funding for graduate student and faculty research on the Middle East first made available by the 1992 Near and Middle East Research and Training Act—originally channeled through the Social Science Research Council and later through the Council of American Overseas Research Centers—was not seen as posing a problem because the funding was allocated first through the U.S. Information Agency and then through the State Department budget. &nbsp;The real issue was which part of the U.S. government was supplying the funding, for what ends, and with what conditions. As early as 1985 the Middle East Studies Association had asked "university-based international studies programs to refrain from responding to requests for research contract proposals from the Defense Academic Research Support Program ~established by the Defense Department to fund academic research on issues of interest to the military~ or from other intelligence entities and call~ed~ upon its members to reflect carefully upon their responsibilities to the academic profession prior to seeking or accepting funding from intelligence sources."6 Some years later MESA also criticized the new National Security Education Program (NSEP), created by the National Security Education Act of 1991. The NSEP sought to bolster the teaching of "less commonly taught" languages (including Arabic, Persian, and Turkish), thereby enabling (as the ~End Page 77~ program’s website put it) "the nation to remain integrally involved in global issues related to U.S. National Security" as well as to "develop a cadre of professionals with more than the traditional knowledge of language and culture who can use this ability to help the U.S. make sound decisions on and deal effectively with global issues related to U.S. National Security" (see the NSEP website at <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.iie.org/programs/nsep/nsephome.htm).  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.iie.org/programs/nsep/nsephome.htm).%27" tppabs="http://www.iie.org/programs/nsep/nsephome.htm)."><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.iie.org/programs/nsep/nsephome.htm).</span></a></span> Unlike other programs funding research and training on the Middle East, the NSEP was housed in the Department of Defense, intelligence agency officials sat on its oversight board, and recipients of the funding it offered were required to work for a government agency involved in national security affairs after their fellowship or scholarship was completed. In a 1993 resolution endorsed by a referendum of its membership, MESA joined with the African Studies Association and the Latin American Studies Association to "deplore the location of responsibility in the U.S. defense and intelligence community for a major foreign area research, education, and training program. . . . This connection can only increase the existing difficulties of gaining foreign governmental permissions to carry out research and to develop overseas instructional programs. It can also create dangers for students and scholars by fostering the perception of involvement in military or intelligence activities, and may limit academic freedom." MESA called on the government to establish a peer and merit review process for funding applications that would be independent of military, intelligence, and foreign policy agencies and to broaden the service requirement so that it would include a much wider range of jobs, including those outside government service. &nbsp;Until its concerns were met, MESA urged that "its members and their institutions not seek or accept program or research funding from NSEA...." Three years later MESA adopted yet another resolution reiterating its rejection of NSEP because the law appropriating funding for the program now required that all fellowship recipients agree to work for the Defense Department or some intelligence agency for at least two years or else repay the cost of their fellowship (see the NSEP website, as well as the MESA resolutions site at <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://w3fp.arizona.edu/mesassoc/resolutions.htm).  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://w3fp.arizona.edu/mesassoc/resolutions.htm).%27" tppabs="http://w3fp.arizona.edu/mesassoc/resolutions.htm)."><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://w3fp.arizona.edu/mesassoc/resolutions.htm).</span></a></span> (This last requirement was later relaxed somewhat so that recipients who ~End Page 78~ could not find employment with a national security agency despite a "good faith effort" to do so could fulfill the service requirement by working in higher education.) MESA would voice the same concerns about other outgrowths of the NSEP, for example, the 2002 National Flagship Language Initiative–Pilot Program (NFLI-P), launched to address what were seen as America’s extraordinary deficiencies in languages critical to national security. Many (though by no means all) Middle East studies faculty adopted MESA’s perspective on this issue, declining to seek NSEP funding for themselves or their institutions. &nbsp;The disinclination by MESA and many of its individual and institutional members to cooperate with the government in ways that had been common in the 1950s and 1960s was certainly not shared by everyone in the field. Yet it is instructive that when in the 1980s reports surfaced of questionable links between academics and intelligence agencies, the most vocal response among scholars in the field was condemnation. A case in point is the scandal surrounding Nadav Safran, a political scientist whose first book set forth an analysis of modern Egyptian history informed by modernization theory and who by the mid-1980s was director of Harvard University’s Center for Middle Eastern Studies. The scandal erupted when it became known that Safran had taken 2445,700 from the Central Intelligence Agency to fund a major international conference he was hosting at Harvard on "Islam and Politics in the Contemporary Muslim World"—a hot topic at the time and one of obvious interest to the CIA. Not only had Safran secretly used CIA funding for this conference, he had not told the invitees, a number of whom were coming from the Middle East, that the CIA was picking up the tab. It then came out that Safran had also received a 24107,430 grant from the CIA for the research project that led to his 1985 book Saudi Arabia: The Ceaseless Request for Security. Safran’s contract with the CIA stipulated that the agency had the right to review and approve the manuscript before publication and that its role in funding the book would not be disclosed. And indeed, the book as published made no mention of the fact that the research for it had been partially funded by the CIA. &nbsp;When the scandal broke, about half the invitees to Safran’s conference withdrew, and many of the faculty and students associated with Harvard’s ~End Page 79~ Center for Middle Eastern Studies publicly expressed their opposition to Safran’s actions. A month later the Middle East Studies Association censured Safran on the grounds that his actions had violated its 1982 resolution calling on scholars to disclose their sources of research funding. Safran intimated that his critics were motivated by anti-Semitism, but after an internal investigation at Harvard he agreed to step down as center director at the end of the academic year.7 Safran was surely not the only academic to have secretly or openly solicited or accepted funding from an intelligence agency for his research in this period, and no doubt such relationships persisted long after this scandal, but the reaction to it—unimaginable in the early decades of U.S. Middle East studies—does indicate how the relationship between academia and the state had changed. Think Tanks and Talking Heads &nbsp;But there was a price to be paid for the gap that had opened up between the world of Middle East scholarship and the world of policymaking. If many college- and university-based academics no longer entirely shared the worldview that prevailed in Washington or no longer felt the need to shape their research agenda so that it was relevant to the policies that flowed from that worldview, there were others who stood ready to meet the demand for knowledge that would serve the state. Many of these were based not in institutions of higher education but in the host of think tanks that had proliferated from the 1970s onward—privately funded institutions oriented toward the production and dissemination of knowledge designed to inform and influence public policy, for our purposes mainly the foreign policy of the United States. &nbsp;Some of these institutions and organizations went back a long way. The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, for example, was founded in 1910 to advance international cooperation, while the Council on Foreign Relations, publisher of the influential journal Foreign Affairs, was established in 1921, originally as a sort of elite dinner club. The liberal Brookings Institution was established in 1927, supported by Carnegie and Rockefeller funding, while the conservative American Enterprise Institute was founded ~End Page 80~ in 1943 to promote "limited government," "free enterprise," and a "strong foreign policy and national defense." After the Second World War, contractors like the huge RAND Corporation entered the field to produce or fund research for the military and intelligence and other government agencies concerned with foreign policy. Another wave beginning in the 1960s had witnessed the establishment of a large number of what one observer called "advocacy" think tanks, like the Center for Strategic and International Studies (1962), the Heritage Foundation (1973), and the Cato Institute (1977), which combined "policy research with aggressive marketing techniques" as they struggled to secure funding and influence in an increasingly competitive marketplace. There are now also many "legacy-based" institutions, like the Carter Center in Atlanta and the Nixon Center for Peace and Freedom in Washington, D.C. By the end of the twentieth century there were an estimated 2,000 organizations engaged in policy analysis based in the United States, a substantial proportion of them focused on foreign policy and international relations.8 The 1970s also witnessed the establishment of what Lisa Anderson called "a new generation of professional graduate schools of public policy," many of whose graduates went on to work for policy-oriented think tanks rather than in colleges and universities (Anderson 2000, 21). &nbsp;The Middle East was a relative backwater for the think tank industry until the 1980s. The Middle East Institute, founded in 1946, published a journal and organized conferences but exercised relatively little political clout. By contrast, the Washington Institute for Near East Policy (WINEP), founded in 1985, quickly achieved a much higher profile and much greater influence. Describing itself as "a public educational foundation dedicated to scholarly research and informed debate on U.S. interests in the Middle East,"9 WINEP emerged as the leading pro-Israel think tank in Washington. Its founding director, Martin Indyk, had previously worked at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), founded in 1959 and by the 1970s by far the most well-funded, visible, and effective pro-Israel lobbying organization.10 &nbsp;Indyk and his colleagues at WINEP worked hard to strengthen Israel’s standing in Washington as the key U.S. ally in the Middle East and to ensure ~End Page 81~ that U.S. policy in the region coincided with the policies and strategies of the Israeli government. During the late 1980s and early 1990s this meant trying to foil U.S. recognition of the PLO and U.S. pressure on Israel to halt settlement activity in the West Bank and Gaza and enter serious negotiations. In the 1990s WINEP expanded its purview to encompass the entire Middle East, but its focus always remained on Israel, for which it tried to build support by arguing that Israel and the United States faced a common threat from Islamic radicalism and terrorism, defined rather broadly to encompass virtually all of Israel’s enemies, state and nonstate. Various other think tanks also began or stepped up research and advocacy on Middle East issues in the late 1990s and early 2000s. These included the Haim Saban Center for Middle East Policy, launched by the Brookings Institution in 2002, and the conservative American Enterprise Institute. &nbsp;During the Clinton administration a substantial number of WINEP alumni served in key foreign policy positions, including Martin Indyk himself, appointed as special assistant to the president and senior director for Near East and South Asian affairs at the National Security Council and, later, as U.S. ambassador to Israel. They and other Clinton administration officials promulgated the policy of "dual containment," whereby the United States would seek to isolate, and if possible eliminate, the governments of both Iraq and Iran, not coincidentally perceived as two of Israel’s most serious enemies. By the late 1990s, however, WINEP would itself be outflanked by newer rivals that unlike WINEP openly aligned themselves with the stances of the Israeli right (or even far right) and argued for aggressive U.S. action against Israel’s enemies, including the overthrow of the regime of Saddam Hussein in Iraq. &nbsp;The policies these and other explicitly right-wing think tanks advocated during the Clinton years, when they were in the political wilderness, were initially regarded as extreme and outlandish. But many of them would eventually be adopted by the George W. Bush administration, in which their architects assumed key posts. Among them were Vice President Richard Cheney; Defense Policy Board member (and for a time chair) Richard Perle, a key advocate of war against Iraq; Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz; Undersecretary of State John Bolton; and Undersecretary ~End Page 82~ of Defense Douglas Feith. Before assuming power these (people) men and their colleagues had, through such right-wing organizations as the Project for a New American Century and the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs, called for the use of U.S. military power to dominate the world, massive increases in military spending, and unequivocal support for the policies of the Israeli right.11 After the attacks of September 11, 2001, President George W. Bush openly embraced much of their agenda, tacitly supporting Israel’s effort to crush the Palestinian uprising by force and in March-April 2003 invading and occupying Iraq. &nbsp;The first years of the twenty-first century thus witnessed an unprecedented convergence in positions of supreme power in Washington of right-wing (and in some cases Christian fundamentalist) zealots and neo-conservative American Jews united by a common vision of securing permanent and unchallengeable U.S. global hegemony, with a strong focus on the Middle East and a close embrace of Israel, a vision to be achieved by military force if necessary. The war against Iraq was in a sense the pilot project for this radical vision. As Michael Ledeen, in 2003 "resident scholar in the Freedom Chair" at the American Enterprise Institute and long a fixture among right-wing foreign-policy activists, was reported to have put it, crudely but not inaccurately: "Every ten years or so, the United States needs to pick up some small crappy little country and throw it against the wall, just to show the world we mean business" (Goldberg 2002). More specifically, a reconstructed, oil-rich Iraq was seen as a valuable new base for U.S. power in the Middle East, enabling the United States to terminate its problematic relationship with Saudi Arabia and compel the Arabs (including the Palestinians) to make peace with Israel on the latter’s terms. That the vast majority of the international community, including a great many Americans, vehemently rejected the use of military force to achieve this vision made no difference whatsoever to its advocates.12 &nbsp;There were certainly voices raised, in academia, the think tank world, and elsewhere, in opposition to this agenda and the understanding of the world that underpinned it, as there had been voices offering alternative views about U.S. policy toward the Middle East at other critical junctures. But during the 1980s, 1990s, and early years of the twenty-first century ~End Page 83~ these voices received relatively little attention, and university-based scholars seemed to play a decreasing role in influencing foreign policy. Critics of U.S. foreign policy also found it difficult to make themselves heard through the mass media. It is striking that the great bulk of the "talking heads" who appeared on television to offer their opinions on the 1990–91 Gulf crisis, on the 2003 Iraq war, and on other issues relating to the Middle East and U.S. policy toward it seemed to come not from academia but from professional pundits, from people associated with think tanks or with one of the public policy schools, and from retired military personnel. Whatever their knowledge (or lack thereof) of the languages, politics, histories, and cultures of the Middle East, these people spoke the language and shared the mindset of the Washington foreign policy world in a way few university-based scholars did. They were also used to communicating their perspective in effective sound bites, whereas academics were often put off by the ignorance and political conformism of much (though by no means all) of American mass media journalism and its tendency to crudely oversimplify complex issues and transform everything (even war) into a form of entertainment. &nbsp;This helped bring about a considerable narrowing of the perspectives available to the public and the consolidation of a powerful, indeed almost impenetrable, consensus about the Middle East that encompassed most of the political class and the punditocracy. Republicans and Democrats argued mainly over how best to maintain U.S. hegemony in the region, leaving very little room for those who envisioned a fundamentally different foreign policy founded on peace, democracy, human rights, mutual security, multilateral disarmament, nonintervention, and respect for international law. It is, however, worth noting that despite the virtual absence of such views in the mass media, they were embraced by a good many Americans, as evidenced by the massive demonstrations that preceded the U.S. attack on Iraq in March 2003 and the polls that indicated substantial public opposition to war, partly because of the new modes and channels of communication and organizing made possible by the Internet. &nbsp;Nonetheless, in the aftermath of September 11th, critical (and even moderate) voices were largely drowned out by the right, which quickly and effectively moved to implement its global agenda by exploiting public ~End Page 84~ outrage against the Islamist extremists who had perpetrated the September 11th attacks. They succeeded in "selling" first military intervention in Afghanistan (justified by the fact that the Taliban regime had allowed al-Qa’ida to operate in that country and refused to hand over those responsible for organizing the September 11th attacks) and then war against Iraq, even though no one was able to produce any credible evidence that the regime of Saddam Hussein had had anything to do with the September 11th attacks or still possessed weapons of mass destruction. In this effort conservative scholars like Bernard Lewis played a significant part, graphically illustrating their continuing, even enhanced, clout in right-wing policymaking circles long after their standing in scholarly circles had declined, as well as the durability and power of some very old Orientalist notions many had mistakenly thought dead as a doornail.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HPragmatismisthebestlensforevaluatingpolicies2013evaluateconsequences2Cnotabstracttheoreticalcriteria" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Pragmatism is the best lens for evaluating policies – evaluate consequences, not abstract theoretical criteria</span></h4><p>Joel <strong>Mintz</strong>, Professor of Law, Nova Southeastern University Law Center; Scholar, Center for Progressive Regulation, <strong>2004</strong>, "Some Thoughts on the Merits of Pragmatism as a Guide to Environmental Protection," 31 B.C.

In large part this may have been because these fields, including Middle East studies as practiced in the United States, were by the 1990s not what they had been 30 years earlier. The sharp decline (within academia, at least) of once dominant paradigms like a cultural-essentialist Orientalism and modernization theory resulted in the dissipation of the intellectual coherence that had characterized the field in its first decades. But the kind of intellectual fragmentation that had come to characterize Middle East studies was the norm across a great many other fields and disciplines and was counterbalanced, probably even outweighed, by the fact that many Middle East specialists, perhaps especially younger scholars, were now not only well versed in the theoretical and methodological issues and debates of their own disciplines but also routinely engaged with innovative work that cut across or transcended disciplinary boundaries. They could thus increasingly manage, without any great difficulty, to participate in productive scholarly conversations not only with their disciplinary colleagues (fellow historians, political scientists, anthropologists, literature specialists, etc.) but also with scholars from other disciplines interested in this part of the world and in others as well. &nbsp;Moreover, because so many scholars working on the Middle East were participants in the scholarly conversations and debates that had transformed broad segments of the humanities and the social sciences in recent decades, Middle East studies had to a considerable extent overcome its ~End Page 73~ insular and rather backward character and was now much more open to, and engaged with, the wider intellectual world than had once been the case. The developments of the last two or three decades, including the critiques of Orientalism and modernization theory; the broad range of new work on colonialism; innovative approaches to historical, social, and cultural analysis influenced by critical anthropology; and, more broadly, heightened interaction among disciplines and fields had given many within Middle East studies a new set of common languages that facilitated productive intellectual exchange.3 This was also a much more intellectually and politically self-aware and self-critical field than was once the case. As a result, the best of the new work in this field was by the beginning of the twenty-first century very much on a par with the best produced in other area studies fields, and scholars specializing in the Middle East were being read and listened to by scholars specializing in other parts of the world as never before.4 &nbsp;In conjunction with a generally higher level of mastery of relevant languages and the use of innovative theoretical and methodological approaches, scholars in the field were by the late twentieth century also making use of a broader range of sources than in the past. A case in point is work on the history of the Arab provinces of the Ottoman empire. Students and scholars with a command of both Arabic and Ottoman Turkish made increasing use not only of the vast Ottoman imperial archives in Istanbul but also of local Islamic court records and family papers, along with more traditional sources like the writings of European consuls and travelers, to produce portraits of social, political, economic, and cultural life in these lands in the last four hundred years of Ottoman rule of unprecedented depth and complexity.5 &nbsp;These studies helped to undermine what was once conventional wisdom in late Ottoman history, that these lands were economically, socially, and culturally stagnant before Napoleon’s army landed in Egypt in 1798; that they were uniformly characterized by despotism, the oppressive and retrograde imposition of Islamic law, and the rigorous segregation and subordination of non-Muslims; and that all real change was induced by contact with the West. Instead, the newer scholarship began to elucidate indigenous sources and dynamics of change while also showing how this ~End Page 74~ region was part of the broader sweep of world history long before the nineteenth century and the onset of westernization or modernization as conventionally understood. As a result of these scholarly advances, Ottoman historians often came to have much broader and more fully comparative perspectives than historians of early modern Europe, many of whom had only recently come to understand that they needed to overcome their own provincialism by addressing the ways in which developments in Europe were not utterly sui generis but often were bound up with larger patterns and dynamics of change that affected large stretches of Eurasia. &nbsp;&nbsp;Scholars and the State &nbsp;If the preceding assessment is accurate, it is fair to say that the changes that transformed Middle East studies in the United States over the last several decades of the twentieth century made it a more intellectually productive and interesting scholarly field. However, this development was accompanied by a growing gap between academics studying the Middle East and the officials, agencies, and institutions of the U.S. government, and a corresponding decline in the influence of university-based scholars on the shaping of foreign policy and on the media, the main purveyor of information, images, and attitudes about the region to the broad public. &nbsp;For one, a good many (though by no means all) students and scholars in this field were less than happy with U.S. government policies toward the Middle East in the 1980s and beyond. Hard evidence is lacking, but it is probably safe to suggest that much of the membership of the Middle East Studies Association, the field’s main professional organization, was not enthusiastic about U.S. support for Saddam Hussein’s regime in its war against Iran in the 1980s, the U.S.-led Gulf War of 1991, the sanctions regime imposed on Iraq thereafter, the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, or, more broadly, the extent to which successive U.S. administrations countenanced Israel’s ongoing occupation of the West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem; its continuing implantation of Jewish settlements there; and its rejection of a Palestinian state in those territories as endorsed by virtually the entire international community. There was a widespread (though never universal) ~End Page 75~ sense that the policies pursued by the United States in the Middle East were hindering, rather than contributing to, peace, democracy, human rights, development, and progress in the region. &nbsp;This disaffection from official policy and the premises that underpinned it did not mean that U.S.-based scholars studying the Middle East were unwilling to share their perspectives on, and try to influence, U.S. policy toward the region. In fact, many devoted a great deal of time and effort to trying to educate the broader public through informal meetings, lectures, articles, op-ed pieces, radio and television interviews, and the like, and to convey their views to elected officials; not a few were also quite willing to meet with State Department and intelligence agency personnel. It is rather that the shared vision of the world, and of the place of the United States within it, that had once linked the world of academia with the world of policymaking had faded, and many scholars no longer spoke the same language as policymakers. &nbsp;Adding to this sense of distance and alienation was a new and much more critical understanding of the proper relationship between scholars and the state—not a surprising development in the aftermath of a period in which the pernicious ends to which scholarly knowledge could be put had been made all too visible, in Vietnam but elsewhere as well. In the first decades of the Cold War a good many scholars in this as in other area studies fields, especially social scientists working on contemporary issues, saw no problem with conducting research on behalf of the government and cooperating with intelligence agencies because they were all part of the good fight against Communism. By the 1980s those who were assuming the leadership in U.S. Middle East studies were by and large much more wary about their sources of funding and the ends to which their training and research, and that of their students, might be put. Fewer scholars were willing to allow what they knew about the region to be used in the service of a state about whose policies they were often at least dubious, for example, by conducting research for agencies like the CIA or by encouraging promising students to enter government service. There developed a widespread sense that to allow one’s research agenda to be determined by the needs of the state or to serve potentially pernicious ends was not only a betrayal of one’s ~End Page 76~ integrity as a scholar but might also compromise one’s ability to conduct research in the Middle East, where by the 1980s real or alleged CIA connections had gotten Americans and others denounced, kidnapped, or worse. &nbsp;At issue was not government funding per se: since the passage of the National Defense Education Act in 1958, a great many students and scholars working on the Middle East had happily made use of NDFL/FLAS and other government fellowships for language training, graduate study, and research. A large proportion of the budgets of the centers for Middle East studies at universities around the country also came from the federal government. But because this individual and institutional funding came through the U.S. Department of Education it was deemed ethically and politically acceptable even by those who most vociferously disagreed with U.S. government policies in the Middle East. Similarly, additional government funding for graduate student and faculty research on the Middle East first made available by the 1992 Near and Middle East Research and Training Act—originally channeled through the Social Science Research Council and later through the Council of American Overseas Research Centers—was not seen as posing a problem because the funding was allocated first through the U.S. Information Agency and then through the State Department budget. &nbsp;The real issue was which part of the U.S. government was supplying the funding, for what ends, and with what conditions. As early as 1985 the Middle East Studies Association had asked "university-based international studies programs to refrain from responding to requests for research contract proposals from the Defense Academic Research Support Program ~established by the Defense Department to fund academic research on issues of interest to the military~ or from other intelligence entities and call~ed~ upon its members to reflect carefully upon their responsibilities to the academic profession prior to seeking or accepting funding from intelligence sources."6 Some years later MESA also criticized the new National Security Education Program (NSEP), created by the National Security Education Act of 1991. The NSEP sought to bolster the teaching of "less commonly taught" languages (including Arabic, Persian, and Turkish), thereby enabling (as the ~End Page 77~ program’s website put it) "the nation to remain integrally involved in global issues related to U.S. National Security" as well as to "develop a cadre of professionals with more than the traditional knowledge of language and culture who can use this ability to help the U.S. make sound decisions on and deal effectively with global issues related to U.S. National Security" (see the NSEP website at <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://www.iie.org/programs/nsep/nsephome.htm).  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://www.iie.org/programs/nsep/nsephome.htm).%27" tppabs="http://www.iie.org/programs/nsep/nsephome.htm)."><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.iie.org/programs/nsep/nsephome.htm).</span></a></span> Unlike other programs funding research and training on the Middle East, the NSEP was housed in the Department of Defense, intelligence agency officials sat on its oversight board, and recipients of the funding it offered were required to work for a government agency involved in national security affairs after their fellowship or scholarship was completed. In a 1993 resolution endorsed by a referendum of its membership, MESA joined with the African Studies Association and the Latin American Studies Association to "deplore the location of responsibility in the U.S. defense and intelligence community for a major foreign area research, education, and training program. . . . This connection can only increase the existing difficulties of gaining foreign governmental permissions to carry out research and to develop overseas instructional programs. It can also create dangers for students and scholars by fostering the perception of involvement in military or intelligence activities, and may limit academic freedom." MESA called on the government to establish a peer and merit review process for funding applications that would be independent of military, intelligence, and foreign policy agencies and to broaden the service requirement so that it would include a much wider range of jobs, including those outside government service. &nbsp;Until its concerns were met, MESA urged that "its members and their institutions not seek or accept program or research funding from NSEA...." Three years later MESA adopted yet another resolution reiterating its rejection of NSEP because the law appropriating funding for the program now required that all fellowship recipients agree to work for the Defense Department or some intelligence agency for at least two years or else repay the cost of their fellowship (see the NSEP website, as well as the MESA resolutions site at <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="javascript:if(confirm(%27http://w3fp.arizona.edu/mesassoc/resolutions.htm).  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?%27))window.location=%27http://w3fp.arizona.edu/mesassoc/resolutions.htm).%27" tppabs="http://w3fp.arizona.edu/mesassoc/resolutions.htm)."><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://w3fp.arizona.edu/mesassoc/resolutions.htm).</span></a></span> (This last requirement was later relaxed somewhat so that recipients who ~End Page 78~ could not find employment with a national security agency despite a "good faith effort" to do so could fulfill the service requirement by working in higher education.) MESA would voice the same concerns about other outgrowths of the NSEP, for example, the 2002 National Flagship Language Initiative–Pilot Program (NFLI-P), launched to address what were seen as America’s extraordinary deficiencies in languages critical to national security. Many (though by no means all) Middle East studies faculty adopted MESA’s perspective on this issue, declining to seek NSEP funding for themselves or their institutions. &nbsp;The disinclination by MESA and many of its individual and institutional members to cooperate with the government in ways that had been common in the 1950s and 1960s was certainly not shared by everyone in the field. Yet it is instructive that when in the 1980s reports surfaced of questionable links between academics and intelligence agencies, the most vocal response among scholars in the field was condemnation. A case in point is the scandal surrounding Nadav Safran, a political scientist whose first book set forth an analysis of modern Egyptian history informed by modernization theory and who by the mid-1980s was director of Harvard University’s Center for Middle Eastern Studies. The scandal erupted when it became known that Safran had taken 2445,700 from the Central Intelligence Agency to fund a major international conference he was hosting at Harvard on "Islam and Politics in the Contemporary Muslim World"—a hot topic at the time and one of obvious interest to the CIA. Not only had Safran secretly used CIA funding for this conference, he had not told the invitees, a number of whom were coming from the Middle East, that the CIA was picking up the tab. It then came out that Safran had also received a 24107,430 grant from the CIA for the research project that led to his 1985 book Saudi Arabia: The Ceaseless Request for Security. Safran’s contract with the CIA stipulated that the agency had the right to review and approve the manuscript before publication and that its role in funding the book would not be disclosed. And indeed, the book as published made no mention of the fact that the research for it had been partially funded by the CIA. &nbsp;When the scandal broke, about half the invitees to Safran’s conference withdrew, and many of the faculty and students associated with Harvard’s ~End Page 79~ Center for Middle Eastern Studies publicly expressed their opposition to Safran’s actions. A month later the Middle East Studies Association censured Safran on the grounds that his actions had violated its 1982 resolution calling on scholars to disclose their sources of research funding. Safran intimated that his critics were motivated by anti-Semitism, but after an internal investigation at Harvard he agreed to step down as center director at the end of the academic year.7 Safran was surely not the only academic to have secretly or openly solicited or accepted funding from an intelligence agency for his research in this period, and no doubt such relationships persisted long after this scandal, but the reaction to it—unimaginable in the early decades of U.S. Middle East studies—does indicate how the relationship between academia and the state had changed. Think Tanks and Talking Heads &nbsp;But there was a price to be paid for the gap that had opened up between the world of Middle East scholarship and the world of policymaking. If many college- and university-based academics no longer entirely shared the worldview that prevailed in Washington or no longer felt the need to shape their research agenda so that it was relevant to the policies that flowed from that worldview, there were others who stood ready to meet the demand for knowledge that would serve the state. Many of these were based not in institutions of higher education but in the host of think tanks that had proliferated from the 1970s onward—privately funded institutions oriented toward the production and dissemination of knowledge designed to inform and influence public policy, for our purposes mainly the foreign policy of the United States. &nbsp;Some of these institutions and organizations went back a long way. The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, for example, was founded in 1910 to advance international cooperation, while the Council on Foreign Relations, publisher of the influential journal Foreign Affairs, was established in 1921, originally as a sort of elite dinner club. The liberal Brookings Institution was established in 1927, supported by Carnegie and Rockefeller funding, while the conservative American Enterprise Institute was founded ~End Page 80~ in 1943 to promote "limited government," "free enterprise," and a "strong foreign policy and national defense." After the Second World War, contractors like the huge RAND Corporation entered the field to produce or fund research for the military and intelligence and other government agencies concerned with foreign policy. Another wave beginning in the 1960s had witnessed the establishment of a large number of what one observer called "advocacy" think tanks, like the Center for Strategic and International Studies (1962), the Heritage Foundation (1973), and the Cato Institute (1977), which combined "policy research with aggressive marketing techniques" as they struggled to secure funding and influence in an increasingly competitive marketplace. There are now also many "legacy-based" institutions, like the Carter Center in Atlanta and the Nixon Center for Peace and Freedom in Washington, D.C. By the end of the twentieth century there were an estimated 2,000 organizations engaged in policy analysis based in the United States, a substantial proportion of them focused on foreign policy and international relations.8 The 1970s also witnessed the establishment of what Lisa Anderson called "a new generation of professional graduate schools of public policy," many of whose graduates went on to work for policy-oriented think tanks rather than in colleges and universities (Anderson 2000, 21). &nbsp;The Middle East was a relative backwater for the think tank industry until the 1980s. The Middle East Institute, founded in 1946, published a journal and organized conferences but exercised relatively little political clout. By contrast, the Washington Institute for Near East Policy (WINEP), founded in 1985, quickly achieved a much higher profile and much greater influence. Describing itself as "a public educational foundation dedicated to scholarly research and informed debate on U.S. interests in the Middle East,"9 WINEP emerged as the leading pro-Israel think tank in Washington. Its founding director, Martin Indyk, had previously worked at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), founded in 1959 and by the 1970s by far the most well-funded, visible, and effective pro-Israel lobbying organization.10 &nbsp;Indyk and his colleagues at WINEP worked hard to strengthen Israel’s standing in Washington as the key U.S. ally in the Middle East and to ensure ~End Page 81~ that U.S. policy in the region coincided with the policies and strategies of the Israeli government. During the late 1980s and early 1990s this meant trying to foil U.S. recognition of the PLO and U.S. pressure on Israel to halt settlement activity in the West Bank and Gaza and enter serious negotiations. In the 1990s WINEP expanded its purview to encompass the entire Middle East, but its focus always remained on Israel, for which it tried to build support by arguing that Israel and the United States faced a common threat from Islamic radicalism and terrorism, defined rather broadly to encompass virtually all of Israel’s enemies, state and nonstate. Various other think tanks also began or stepped up research and advocacy on Middle East issues in the late 1990s and early 2000s. These included the Haim Saban Center for Middle East Policy, launched by the Brookings Institution in 2002, and the conservative American Enterprise Institute. &nbsp;During the Clinton administration a substantial number of WINEP alumni served in key foreign policy positions, including Martin Indyk himself, appointed as special assistant to the president and senior director for Near East and South Asian affairs at the National Security Council and, later, as U.S. ambassador to Israel. They and other Clinton administration officials promulgated the policy of "dual containment," whereby the United States would seek to isolate, and if possible eliminate, the governments of both Iraq and Iran, not coincidentally perceived as two of Israel’s most serious enemies. By the late 1990s, however, WINEP would itself be outflanked by newer rivals that unlike WINEP openly aligned themselves with the stances of the Israeli right (or even far right) and argued for aggressive U.S. action against Israel’s enemies, including the overthrow of the regime of Saddam Hussein in Iraq. &nbsp;The policies these and other explicitly right-wing think tanks advocated during the Clinton years, when they were in the political wilderness, were initially regarded as extreme and outlandish. But many of them would eventually be adopted by the George W. Bush administration, in which their architects assumed key posts. Among them were Vice President Richard Cheney; Defense Policy Board member (and for a time chair) Richard Perle, a key advocate of war against Iraq; Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz; Undersecretary of State John Bolton; and Undersecretary ~End Page 82~ of Defense Douglas Feith. Before assuming power these (people) men and their colleagues had, through such right-wing organizations as the Project for a New American Century and the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs, called for the use of U.S. military power to dominate the world, massive increases in military spending, and unequivocal support for the policies of the Israeli right.11 After the attacks of September 11, 2001, President George W. Bush openly embraced much of their agenda, tacitly supporting Israel’s effort to crush the Palestinian uprising by force and in March-April 2003 invading and occupying Iraq. &nbsp;The first years of the twenty-first century thus witnessed an unprecedented convergence in positions of supreme power in Washington of right-wing (and in some cases Christian fundamentalist) zealots and neo-conservative American Jews united by a common vision of securing permanent and unchallengeable U.S. global hegemony, with a strong focus on the Middle East and a close embrace of Israel, a vision to be achieved by military force if necessary. The war against Iraq was in a sense the pilot project for this radical vision. As Michael Ledeen, in 2003 "resident scholar in the Freedom Chair" at the American Enterprise Institute and long a fixture among right-wing foreign-policy activists, was reported to have put it, crudely but not inaccurately: "Every ten years or so, the United States needs to pick up some small crappy little country and throw it against the wall, just to show the world we mean business" (Goldberg 2002). More specifically, a reconstructed, oil-rich Iraq was seen as a valuable new base for U.S. power in the Middle East, enabling the United States to terminate its problematic relationship with Saudi Arabia and compel the Arabs (including the Palestinians) to make peace with Israel on the latter’s terms. That the vast majority of the international community, including a great many Americans, vehemently rejected the use of military force to achieve this vision made no difference whatsoever to its advocates.12 &nbsp;There were certainly voices raised, in academia, the think tank world, and elsewhere, in opposition to this agenda and the understanding of the world that underpinned it, as there had been voices offering alternative views about U.S. policy toward the Middle East at other critical junctures. But during the 1980s, 1990s, and early years of the twenty-first century ~End Page 83~ these voices received relatively little attention, and university-based scholars seemed to play a decreasing role in influencing foreign policy. Critics of U.S. foreign policy also found it difficult to make themselves heard through the mass media. It is striking that the great bulk of the "talking heads" who appeared on television to offer their opinions on the 1990–91 Gulf crisis, on the 2003 Iraq war, and on other issues relating to the Middle East and U.S. policy toward it seemed to come not from academia but from professional pundits, from people associated with think tanks or with one of the public policy schools, and from retired military personnel. Whatever their knowledge (or lack thereof) of the languages, politics, histories, and cultures of the Middle East, these people spoke the language and shared the mindset of the Washington foreign policy world in a way few university-based scholars did. They were also used to communicating their perspective in effective sound bites, whereas academics were often put off by the ignorance and political conformism of much (though by no means all) of American mass media journalism and its tendency to crudely oversimplify complex issues and transform everything (even war) into a form of entertainment. &nbsp;This helped bring about a considerable narrowing of the perspectives available to the public and the consolidation of a powerful, indeed almost impenetrable, consensus about the Middle East that encompassed most of the political class and the punditocracy. Republicans and Democrats argued mainly over how best to maintain U.S. hegemony in the region, leaving very little room for those who envisioned a fundamentally different foreign policy founded on peace, democracy, human rights, mutual security, multilateral disarmament, nonintervention, and respect for international law. It is, however, worth noting that despite the virtual absence of such views in the mass media, they were embraced by a good many Americans, as evidenced by the massive demonstrations that preceded the U.S. attack on Iraq in March 2003 and the polls that indicated substantial public opposition to war, partly because of the new modes and channels of communication and organizing made possible by the Internet. &nbsp;Nonetheless, in the aftermath of September 11th, critical (and even moderate) voices were largely drowned out by the right, which quickly and effectively moved to implement its global agenda by exploiting public ~End Page 84~ outrage against the Islamist extremists who had perpetrated the September 11th attacks. They succeeded in "selling" first military intervention in Afghanistan (justified by the fact that the Taliban regime had allowed al-Qa’ida to operate in that country and refused to hand over those responsible for organizing the September 11th attacks) and then war against Iraq, even though no one was able to produce any credible evidence that the regime of Saddam Hussein had had anything to do with the September 11th attacks or still possessed weapons of mass destruction. In this effort conservative scholars like Bernard Lewis played a significant part, graphically illustrating their continuing, even enhanced, clout in right-wing policymaking circles long after their standing in scholarly circles had declined, as well as the durability and power of some very old Orientalist notions many had mistakenly thought dead as a doornail.</p><h4 id="HCan2019tsolverootcause" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Can’t solve root cause</span></h4><p>D.S.L. <strong>Jarvis</strong>, Lecturer in IR at the University of Sydney, International Relations and the Challenges of Postmodernism, <strong>2000</strong>, p. 129<br/>Perhaps more alarming though is the outright violence Ashley recommends in response to what at <br/>AND<br/>to address the real life plight of those who struggle at marginal places.&nbsp;</p><h4 id="HWe2019llmakeafewfwargshereinresponsetotheirargs" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>We’ll make a few fw args here in response to their args</span></h4><h4 id="HOurinterp2013debateabouttheplanisgood" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Our interp – debate about the plan is good</span></h4><h4 id="HKeytoportableskills2013Alimitedtopicofdiscussionthatprovidesforequitablegroundiskeytoproductiveinculcationofdecision-makingandadvocacyskillsineveryandallfacetsoflife2014-eveniftheirpositioniscontestablethat2019sdistinctfromitbeingvaluablydebatable2014-thisstillprovidesroomforflexibility2Ccreativity2Candinnovation2Cbuttargetsthediscussiontoavoidmerestatementsoffact" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Key to portable skills – A limited topic of discussion that provides for equitable ground is key to productive inculcation of decision-making and advocacy skills in every and all facets of life—-even if their position is contestable that’s distinct from it being valuably debatable—-this still provides room for flexibility, creativity, and innovation, but targets the discussion to avoid mere statements of fact</span></h4><p>Austin J. <strong>Freeley</strong>, a Boston based attorney who focuses on criminal, personal injury and civil rights law, <strong>and</strong> David L. <strong>Steinberg</strong>, Lecturer of Communication Studies @ U Miami, <strong>2008</strong>, Argumentation and Debate: Critical Thinking for Reasoned Decision Making pp61-63<br/>&nbsp;Debate is a means of settling differences, so there must be a difference <br/>AND</p><dl><dd>the comparative effectiveness of writing or physical force for a specific purpose.</dd></dl><h4 id="HTheircritiquefailswithoutpriorpredictability.Mindsetchangeoccursfrominternalreflectionduringpre-roundpreparation2Cnotin-rounddiscourse" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Their critique fails without prior predictability.

As a result, the White House has, for the last several months, been considering whether or not to assassinate him by drone without trial or due process.¶ Supposedly, the one thing that’s held up sending in the drones is the administration’s desire to make sure the kill is “legal”. (Those quotes again.)¶ Last May, Obama gave a speech on the subject. It was, in part, a response to growing anger in Pakistan, Yemen and elsewhere over the CIA’s ongoing drone assassination campaigns with all their “collateral damage”, and to the White House’s reported “kill list”. In it, he insisted that any target of the drones must pose “a continuing and imminent threat to the American people”. At the time, the White House also issued a fact sheet that stated:¶ Lethal force must only be used to prevent or stop attacks against U.S. persons, and even then, only when capture is not feasible and no other reasonable alternatives exist to address the threat effectively.¶ While that sounds like a pretty imposing set of hurdles to leap, all of the “legal” criteria are determined in secret by the White House with advice from the Justice Department, but with no oversight or accountability.¶ Even then, it turns out that the supposedly tortured deliberations of the administration are not really necessary. Despite the president’s criteria, according to an unnamed administration official quoted by the Associated Press, Obama could make an exception to his policy and authorize the CIA to strike on a one-time basis, no matter what the circumstances. One way or another, it is Obama who decides who to kill and when.¶ Short-Term Questions¶ At this point, it’s unclear just why the Obama administration leaked its plans in reference to this errant American abroad. After all, official after official has insisted that Edward Snowden’s revelations of secret NSA documents have caused terrorists to change their communication tactics, yet the one American up to no good somewhere in the terrorist world apparently has not done so in response to the leak about his potential fate, and will remain locatable whenever needed as a target. And yet giving notice of a possible attack in advance in the media would, on the face of it, seem both counterproductive and an invitation to the very barrage of criticisms leveled by key officials at Snowden. After all, under the circumstances, an American connected with al-Qaida wouldn’t exactly have to be a Bond villain to decide to change his behavior and his location, stay indoors or outdoors more, keep off his phone for a while or trade it in for another.¶ Could the administration leak have been a trick to flush the bad guy out, causing him to panic and run? Was it an elaborate ruse designed to induce widespread concern in al-Qaida about the liabilities of having American compatriots? Was it a bone thrown to Republicans otherwise eager to paint the president as weak? Could it have been some kind of geopolitical muscle tussle with once compliant but now more assertively anti-drone Pakistan? Or could the leak have been a PSYOP on the American people, an attempt to manipulate us into feeling better about government decisions to kill American citizens by revealing the deliberative and heart-wrenching process Obama goes through? Or could it simply have been an attempt to normalize such acts for us, to make them part of the understandable everyday background noise of a dangerous world?¶ The answer is: we don’t know. Not yet anyway.¶ Not the First Time¶ The Obama administration admits to killing four Americans as part of its war on (or is it “war of”?) terror. We’ll pause here a moment for you to contemplate whether there could have been other, undocumented killings of the same sort awaiting the revelations of some future Edward Snowden or Chelsea Manning.¶ On May 7, 2011, a US drone fired a missile in Yemen aimed at American citizen and key terror suspect Anwar al-Awlaki. The missile blew up a car with two other people in it, quickly labeled “al-Qaida operatives” after we killed them.¶ Such collateral killings should be no surprise. The inaugural article by Glenn Greenwald and Jeremy Scahill at their new media venture notes that the National Security Agency regularly identifies targets for CIA assassinations based on metadata analysis and cell-phone tracking. Rather than confirming that target’s identity, the CIA is evidently ready and willing to blow a suspect away based on the location of a mobile phone he assumedly is using. In other words, people can be killed because they borrowed the wrong cell phone. (So much for a deliberative process.)¶ The US had tried to kill al-Awlaki before, including in the Bush years – and missed. In justifying one of these assassination attempts, Obama’s counterterrorism chief, Michael Leiter, claimed that al-Awlaki actually posed a bigger threat to the US “homeland” than Osama bin Laden, albeit without explanation. No matter, they finally got their man. A follow-up strike killed al-Awlaki, and another soon after obliterated his teenage son, also in Yemen. Though no one argues that the boy was in any way linked to terrorism and no administration official has bothered to explain just why he was targeted, former White House press secretary Robert Gibbs did comment that the killing was justified as he “should have had a more responsible father”.¶ Couldn’t Happen Here?¶ Though the president and his officials go to great pains to indicate that such assassinations are only going to happen abroad, there is nothing in the carefully worded distinctions made by the White House to preclude them at home. As a start, in his criteria for killing someone extrajudicially, the president claims there is no difference between an American citizen terrorist and a foreign terrorist. A careful look back at the statements of two government officials makes it clear that thought has already gone into the question of bringing the killings home.¶ Remember the testimony then-FBI Director Robert Mueller gave before a House subcommittee in 2012? When asked point-blank if the president could order the killing of an American in the United States, he replied, “Uh, I’m not certain whether that was addressed or not ... I’m going to defer that to others in the Department of Justice.” Mueller, of course, had the option of saying flat-out, “No, no, of course the president can’t order a hit on an American here in the U.S. where the full judicial system, Constitution and due process protections exist! Are you mad?”¶ The truth emerged only in 2013 when Senator Rand Paul asked point-blank whether the president could authorize lethal force, such as a drone strike, against an American citizen in the United States. Attorney General Eric Holder fired back that while the question was “hypothetical”, the real-world answer was yes. Holder said he could imagine “an extraordinary circumstance in which it would be necessary and appropriate under the Constitution and applicable laws of the United States for the president to authorize the military to use lethal force within the territory of the United States.”¶ It’s easy enough, in fact, to imagine the sort of scenarios that might lend themselves to such an act: a ticking time bomb, a killer believed to have anthrax and on the loose, a suspected dirty-bomb maker in a desolate location, terrorists with a bus full of children on a mountain top. Imagine a slippery slope and... presto! You’re there.¶ They’ve thought about it. They’ve set up the legal manipulations necessary to justify it. The broad, open-ended criteria the president laid out for killing suspected terrorists exposes the post-Constitutional stance our government has already prepared for. All that’s left to do is pull the trigger.¶ Nostalgia for the Fifth Amendment¶ It’s still possible to remember, almost nostalgically, how the Fifth Amendment used to guarantee Americans due process. The key phrase was indeed that “due process”. It meant the government could not take away your property or imprison or execute you without first allowing you a chance to defend yourself. You would have your day in court with a lawyer and a jury of your peers to make the final decision. This would all be quite public and the people involved would be held accountable for their actions. The Fifth was meant by those who wrote it as a check on the ultimate in government excess: the purposeful taking of citizens’ lives. Today, it increasingly seems an artifact of a quaint past, as seemingly lost to history as the corded phone or manual typewriter.¶ Attorney General Eric Holder publicly rewrote the Fifth Amendment in 2012, declaring, in a veiled reference to al-Awlaki, “that a careful and thorough executive branch review of the facts in a case amounts to ‘due process’ and that the Constitution’s Fifth Amendment protection against depriving a citizen of his or her life without due process of law does not mandate a ‘judicial process’.” In other words, in a pinch, skip the courts. In this way, Holder gave us a peak behind the White House curtain, making clear that the president’s personal and secret decision to kill an American, perhaps made over morning coffee, was, in his opinion, good enough to make everything legal.¶ The due process question Holder dismissed so casually still looms large over al-Awlaki’s murder. Prior to the killing, attorneys for his father tried to persuade a U.S. District Court to issue an injunction preventing the government from killing him in Yemen. A judge dismissed the case, ruling that the father did not have “standing” to sue and that government officials themselves were immune from lawsuits for actions carried out as part of their official duties.¶ This was the first time a father had sought to sue the US government to prevent it from killing a son without trial. The judge did call the suit “unique and extraordinary”, but ultimately passed on getting involved. He wrote instead that it was up to the elected branches of government, not the courts, to determine if the United States has the authority to extrajudicially murder its own citizens.¶ The judge’s position was revealing of our moment. The extrajudicial killing of an American citizen seemed to him to be nothing but a political question to be argued out in Congress and the White House, not something intimately woven into the founding documents of our nation. The judge was not alone in his characterization of the problem. Mike Rogers, chair of the House Intelligence Committee, complained that the killing of more terror suspects in a similar manner has been held back by “self-imposed red tape”.¶ There are, however, no footnotes in the Fifth Amendment, no caveats, no secret memos, no exceptions for terrorism, mass rape, child torture, or any other horror the US has confronted in its 238 years of existence. Such addendums to the Fifth were unnecessary, because in the beautiful preciseness of Lincoln’sphrasing at Gettysburg, ours is “a government of the people, by the people, for the people”, one made up of us, beholden to us and whose purpose is to serve us.¶ Such a government would be incapable of killing its own citizens without due care, debate and open trial. Those actions would violate the sacred convent of trust between a people and their government in a democracy, the “consent of the governed” and delegitimize the government itself.¶ That last point is worth a closer look, because it makes clear what murder-by-decree really represents in post-Constitutional America. The phrase “consent of the governed” first appears in the Declaration of Independence, the document by which the United States declared itself no longer under the governance of the British king. The Declaration makes clear that a government’s moral right to use state power is only justified and legal when derived from the people over which that power is exercised. Such consent is the opposite of the divine right of kings, the philosophy under which the British ruled colonial Americans. Its foundational principle was obedience to government and its edicts and decisions, even on issues of life and death, as a religious and moral obligation.¶ Following the more philosophical Declaration of Independence, the Bill of Rights was a practical exercise written to address directly the specific injustices of rule by royal decree. By turning its back on key elements of our founding, Washington, it seems, has brought us full circle.¶ Life in Post-Constitutional America¶ These days in the pseudo-debates about drone killings in the mainstream media, such changes are treated as matters of no great significance. On the day that the president’s latest plans for the murder of a fellow citizen in the distant tribal backlands of Pakistan first appeared, they caused little stir. The headlines were instead dominated by Olympic gossip and an impending ice storm in Atlanta. Killings extrajudicially mandated by the White House? The Fifth Amendment? Maybe if the target were Shaun White in Sochi, more people would have cared.¶ At the moment, we are threatened with a return to a pre-Constitutional situation that Americans would once have dismissed out of hand, a society in which the head of state can take a citizen’s life on his (or her) own say-so. If it’s the model for the building of post-Constitutional America, we’re in trouble. Indeed the stakes are high, whether we notice or not.¶ The question is: How far will post-Constitutional America stray from the nation so conceived in the Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights?

The initial issue was whether the Executive had plenary power to detain enemy combatants.29 The second issue was what process, if any, was due to persons who were detained as enemy combatants.30 The Supreme Court was badly splintered on how to resolve these two issues. Justice O’Connor issued a plurality opinion, joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices Kennedy and Breyer, in which she announced the judgment of the Court; Justice Souter, joined by Justice Ginsburg, concurred in part and dissented in part; Justice Scalia, joined by Justice Stevens, dissented; and Justice Thomas dissented.31 The Court ultimately concluded that it did not have to decide the first issue, finding that Congress had authorized the Executive to detain enemy combatants.32 Five Justices (O’Connor, the justices joining her plurality opinion, and Justice Thomas) concluded that the AUMF authorized the detention.33 The plurality made clear, however, that detention was only authorized when it was “sufficiently clear that the individual is, in fact, an enemy combatant.”34 This reasoning required that a determination be made as to whether there was sufficient evidence that an individual is an enemy combatant, which necessarily raised the issue of what process is due to an individual in the determination as to whether he was an enemy combatant.35 In resolving what process was due, two sub-issues needed to be settled. The first was which branch was to decide the process due to the detained individuals.36 The second was what process was in fact due in determining whether an individual was being properly detained.37 Regarding the issue of who decided what process was due, the Executive’s position was that under the doctrines of separation of powers and political question—in this case, the Supreme Court’s lack of qualifications in “matters of military decision-making”—the Judiciary was limited only to determining whether authorization existed “for the broader detention scheme” and had no authority to determine the propriety of individual detentions.38 Alternatively, the Executive argued that the Court “should review . . . the Executive’s determination that a . . . person is an enemy combatant under a very deferential . . . standard.”39 A majority of the Court (Justice O’Connor, the justices joining her plurality opinion, and Justice Scalia, joined by Justice Stevens in his dissent) rejected both of these positions, ruling that it is the Judiciary that makes these determinations.40<br/>CP text is incoherent – XO can’t enjoin – only the courts can – reason to reject the CP on face<br/>Nothing to solve – the aff is a legal argument not a mechanism that averts a harm – CP is an incoherent statement<br/>Also – the past executive targeting is still illegal – the CP is like Ted Bundy getting acquitted because he promised not to do it again<br/>Courts have sole discretion over treason – the Executive has almost no authority and can’t change the definition or render legal <br/>Randal John Meyer, J.D.

Mindful of their status as traitors while fighting the rule of England,54 they sought to eliminate the potential for abusive prosecution of treason against groups with public grievances by including systemic, constitutional restrictions.55 First they created a fixed, restrictive definition of treason by limiting it to the two offenses enumerated in the Constitution—levying war and adhering to the enemy. 56 Second, they deliberately moved the Treason Clause to its final position in Article III from its draft position in Article I so that the Judiciary would “administer the clause” and Congress would have no power with respect to the scope of the offense.57 Third, they established an evidentiary requirement that two witnesses testify to the same overt treasonous act, which further reflected the “fundamentally restrictive attitude” behind the Drafters’ inclusion of the Clause.58 Finally, regarding the scope of the punishment, corruption of blood,59 the forfeiture of the convicted traitor’s estate and disinheritance of successors, 60 were prohibited entirely. In the broadest sense, the Drafters sought to disable the Government from either amending the definition of treason, or from punishing traitors without first satisfying a high burden of proof. Interpreting the Clause with an eye toward its restrictive nature, Chief Justice Marshall acknowledged in Ex parte Bollman that: To prevent the possibility of those calamities . . . that great fundamental law which defines and limits the various departments of our government has given a rule on the subject both to the legislature and the courts of America, which neither can be permitted to transcend. Treason against the United States shall consist only in levying war against them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort.62 Accordingly, the Court created a doctrinal rule to reflect the comprehensive yet precisely circumscribed treason definition enshrined in the Constitution: from Bollman in 1807 to Cramer v. United States in 1947, the Court has consistently held that treason may not be extended beyond its constitutional definition.63 By virtue of this rule against constructive treasons, merely immaterial variations in the elements of treason that leave the gravamen of the offense intact will not create a separate offense which avoids bringing the additional procedural protections of the Treason Clause into play. 2. Separation of Powers: The State’s Role in Crimes against the State Although the relocation of the Treason Clause from Article I to Article III was intended to constrain the legislature, “The treason clause &nbsp;is clearly a limitation &nbsp;upon all the agencies of government, instead of . . . the legislative branch only.”65 Congress only has the power to prescribe a limited punishment and has no power to redefine treason as such or to expand that category of behavior that falls within the ambit of “treason.” 66 The Judiciary is given the responsibility to administer the law of treason, yet cannot expand the definition of treason.67 The Executive has no express grant of responsibility with respect to treason, but one may reasonably presume that the President’s Article II “take care” powers68 would encompass, for example, the incidental role of serving as prosecutor, custodian, or executioner. The Constitution’s lack of any express grant should be read as giving the President the least authority in the administration of treason. Further, in Ex parte Garland, the Supreme Court read the prohibition against corruptions of blood as a constitutional charge to the Judiciary: “Therefore, to still further guard against this odious form of punishment, it is provided, in section three of article iii, concerning the judiciary that Congress may not work a corruption of blood . . . .” 70 This reading by the Court—that the placement of the Treason Clause and its prohibition on corruptions of blood in Article III charges the Judiciary to guard against its use—further bolsters the conclusion that the placement of treason within Article III textually commits the role of administering treason law to the Judiciary.71 This reading of Article III as a separation of powers regarding the administration of treason law was most recently affirmed in the 2013 case New York Times Co. v. U.S. Department of Justice.<br/>No neg fiat in the context of legal aff – makes it impossible to read this aff because it changes the law in unpredictable ways – produces terrible legal thinking and unrealistic policy choices – that’s the Epstein ev – that’s also uniquely key to war powers thinking – that’s the Corn evidence<br/>If anything, they only CP they would get is coming to the same legal conclusion through different grounds<br/>Independently fiating the object of the plan is a voting issue – <br/>collapses the topic by imagining a world in which the executive doesn’t do the things legal restraints are supposed to apply to <br/>especially true in the context of legal affs because the CP just fiats that the legal dispute wouldn’t exist <br/>makes it impossible to read any other aff because all solvency deficits either link to the aff or are solved by fiat</p></div></div></td><td>3/28/14</td></tr><tr><td style="width:100%; word-break:break-all; word-break:break-word;"><div><p><input onclick="saveEntry(35)" src="../../xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" tppabs="http://opencaselist13.paperlessdebate.com/xwiki/resources/icons/silk/page_save.png" style="float:right;" title="Save" type="image" value="Save"></input>
