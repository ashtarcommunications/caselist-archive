My partner and I believe that we should set aside that privilege in order to confront the historical and ongoing dynamics of oppression that affect Native Americans. As queer subjects, we don’t conform to stable concepts of gender and identity. From this position, we can challenge the normative categories that dominate Native peoples and destabilize their value. We are called to respond to a resolution that uses the term “the United States” not once, but twice, referencing both a governmental and spatial entity. We believe that to talk about energy production “in the United States,” it is imperative for us to first discuss how this idea of energy has played out in and against Native American communities since Contact, 500 years ago.**&#xD;

solutions__**, said cutting-edge American Indian scholar Taiaiake Alfred at a &#xD;
recent Syracuse University lecture. Alfred, a Mohawk who teaches in the Indigenous Governance Program at the University of Victoria, British Columbia, discussed the contents of his new book, &amp;#39;&amp;#39;Wasase: Indigenous Pathways of Action and Freedom&amp;#39;&amp;#39; - namely, ways in which Natives can learn to live and think as Onkwehonkwe, original people. The book, he said, is based on the experiences of Natives who have accomplished this goal. &amp;#39;&amp;#39;It is time for our people to live again,&amp;#39;&amp;#39; the book begins. It goes on to detail a journey away from the effects of the white invasion of the Americas, which Alfred sees as the source of most major problems in Indian communities today. **__&amp;#39;&amp;#39;The journey is__** a living **__commitment to__** meaningful change in our lives by ... **__regenerating our cultures, and struggling against the forces that keep us bound to our colonial past__**,&amp;#39;&amp;#39; Alfred wrote. **__Colonial values have become ingrained in the Indian community__**, he said, addressing a packed room at the Syracuse University College of Law. These values, which run contrary to traditional Native beliefs, have caused long-standing problems of the community, the body and the spirit. **__&amp;#39;&amp;#39;The most damaging aspect of colonization was the way it was premised on a relationship of white domination and Indian subordination__**,&amp;#39;&amp;#39; said Scott Lyons, a Native scholar and creative writing professor at Syracuse University who attended Alfred&amp;#39;s lecture. **__This colonial notion of Indian inferiority was drilled into Native communities throughout history__**, Lyons added. **__The policy of allotment__**, for example - **__privatizing and parceling out tribal land to individuals - was designed to create capitalistic values in the Indian community. Capitalism, and the dependency on the non-Native world that necessarily accompanies it, still dominates Indian life today.__** For this reason, Alfred said, **__Natives have discovered that the legal and legislative battles won by their communities over the last few decades are what he called &amp;#39;&amp;#39;hollow victories.&amp;#39;__**&amp;#39; **__Tribal courts__** and **__indigenous governments__**, for instance, have arisen,**__ and many Natives communities have won independence from the United States__** or Canada. **__Too often__**, however, **__these institutions resemble those of the colonizers. No real change can come from the halls, desks and courts of such institutions.__** &amp;#39;&amp;#39;When it comes down to surviving or not surviving, none of these laws are going to matter,&amp;#39;&amp;#39; said Regina Jones, an Oneida and the program coordinator for Syracuse&amp;#39;s Office of Multicultural Affairs, who also attended the lecture. &amp;#39;&amp;#39;What we really need is a society that doesn&amp;#39;t depend on department stores.&amp;#39;&amp;#39; Recalling his first two books, Alfred traced the evolution of Indian resistance to colonial problems over the last few decades. **__Native scholars and activists__** soon **__realized that legal victories were &amp;#39;&amp;#39;very dangerous,&amp;#39;&amp;#39; leading to more dependency on white ways of thinking.__**</headline></objectSummary></objects>
