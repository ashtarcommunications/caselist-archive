No evidence of coming ‘water wars’
International basins that include political boundaries of two or more countries cover around 45% of the Earth’s land surface, host about 40% of the world’s population and account for approximately 60% of global river flow. Moreover, the number is growing: in 1978, the United Nations listed 214 international basins; today there are 276, largely due to the internationalization of basins through political changes like the break-up of the Soviet Union and the former Yugoslavia, as well as access to better mapping technology.

The ultimate effectiveness of any policy is largely dependent on the individual efficacy and coordination of the agents or agencies that implement it. There are ample illustrations of the truth of this premise in the recent attempts by the Administration and Congress to formulate and implement a national energy policy, as a result, that policy, irrespective of any intrinsic soundness, could inevitably become trapped in a quagmire of regulatory policies and practices. The difficulties that energy policymakers in the United States have experienced in 1974 and 1975 arc in many respects symptomatic of the very problem that they have intended to resolve—the lack of a comprehensive and coordinated national energy policy. Decisions concerning energy supply and general policy that have been made over the years have contributed to the creation of areas of special concern and interest, institutionalized them, and nourished them through dedicated sponsorship by either the Congress, the Executive Branch, the independent federal agencies, or industry. The difficulties that stymied congressional consideration and executive implementation of an effective energy policy in 1974 and the first half of 1975 mirror this state of affairs.

Obama will approve Keystone
Seib, 2/18
(Wall Street Journal Columnist, “How Obama Might Get to &amp;#39;Yes&amp;#39; on Keystone Pipeline,” http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323764804578312290010174614.html)
One of President Barack Obama&amp;#39;s trickiest political tasks early in his second term has nothing to do with taxes, budget or the debt ceiling. Rather, it will be his decision this spring on whether to give the go-ahead to the Keystone XL pipeline. Keystone XL—the proposed new spur of a transcontinental pipeline that would carry heavy crude oil from Canada to refineries on the U.S. Gulf Coast—was splitting Mr. Obama&amp;#39;s Democratic coalition even before it became highly politicized when a decision was put off during last year&amp;#39;s presidential campaign. Now, the temperature is rising. Environmentalists, whose admiration for Mr. Obama is about matched by their hatred of the pipeline and the oil it would transport, were busy over the weekend protesting in Washington in an attempt to stop the pipeline. Still, unions back the idea because of the construction and refining jobs it could create, and nine Democratic senators have joined 44 Republicans in a letter asking for approval. There is ample reason to think the second-term Obama White House, seeing openings to shake America&amp;#39;s dependence on Middle East oil, would like to find a way to give the green light. And if that&amp;#39;s so, a combination of forces are lining up in a way that should make it possible for Mr. Obama to get to a &amp;#34;yes&amp;#34; answer, while limiting the political fallout. One argument Mr. Obama can muster for Keystone XL is that the delay in approval that he ordered last year has worked, at least as far as environmental concerns go. It bought time for a change that addresses a principal worry, which was the route of the pipeline. Initially, the pipeline was to go through Nebraska&amp;#39;s ecologically sensitive Sand Hills region. Even within deep-red Nebraska, environmental concerns about that route ran high enough to create a roadblock. Now, the route has been changed. A Nebraska state agency said last month the environmental risks of this new route would be &amp;#34;minimal,&amp;#34; and Republican Gov. Dave Heineman just gave the pipeline a green light. Environmental groups aren&amp;#39;t concerned merely with the route of the pipeline, of course, but with its very reason for existence: its use in facilitating the further burning of oil, and specifically oil extracted from Canada&amp;#39;s tar sands, which is dirtier than average to produce. But on this front, the pipeline&amp;#39;s symbolic importance outstrips its practical impact. Stopping Keystone won&amp;#39;t stop Canada from producing the oil. The Canadians have too much invested in oil-sands extraction to simply stop. One likely effect of shutting down the pipeline—aside from deeply straining U.S.-Canadian relations—would be to divert the same oil into exports to Asia, for use by China, a country that is doing far less on other fronts to deal with climate change and dirty auto emissions than is the U.S. More immediately, tar-sands oil still would find its way to the U.S. by other routes—rail, truck and other pipelines—meaning its use won&amp;#39;t be extinguished, but the efficiency by which it is brought to market would be diminished. More important, though, is the broader environmental backdrop of the Keystone decisions. The U.S. is starting to make meaningful progress on reducing greenhouse-gas emissions, despite the hard reality that it can&amp;#39;t yet shake its addition to oil. Thanks to a combination of forces—the increasing use of relatively clean natural gas, improved energy efficiency and, yes, a world-wide recession—the U.S. actually is on track to meet its goal of reducing its greenhouse-gas emissions to 17% below 2005 levels by 2020, a goal Mr. Obama laid out in late 2009. The U.S. is outpacing Europe in reducing carbon emissions. Which opens the door to the real path Mr. Obama can travel in selling Keystone XL approval to his party&amp;#39;s base. It is possible to combine Keystone with other environmental moves to show that progress in cutting greenhouse gases will continue even as the pipeline is built. In his State of the Union address last week, Mr. Obama called on Congress to construct a &amp;#34;bipartisan, market-based solution to climate change,&amp;#34; citing specifically an approach Republican Sen. John McCain and then-Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman advanced several years ago. But if Congress doesn&amp;#39;t act, Mr. Obama said, he would explore &amp;#34;executive actions&amp;#34; to reduce pollution and address climate change. That suggests the president would consider moving beyond an existing Environmental Protection Agency proposal to regulate emissions from new power plants and perhaps put new limits on emissions from existing coal-powered plants. Whatever the president has in mind specifically, it should be easier to sell Keystone XL if that decision is paired with one showing that the progress the U.S. already has made on climate change will continue, even if the U.S. can&amp;#39;t soon kick its oil habit. That is precisely the picture Mr. Obama ought to be able to paint as the big decision point nears.

Goes nuclear
Wallace, 10
(Professor Emeritus at the University of British Columbia, March, “Ridding the Arctic of Nuclear Weapons A Task Long Overdue”, http://www.arcticsecurity.org/docs/arctic-nuclear-report-web.pdf)

The fact is, the Arctic is becoming a zone of increased military competition. Russian President Medvedev has announced the creation of a special military force to defend Arctic claims. Last year Russian General Vladimir Shamanov declared that Russian troops would step up training for Arctic combat, and that Russia’s submarine fleet would increase its “operational radius.” Recently, two Russian attack submarines were spotted off the U.S. east coast for the first time in 15 years. In January 2009, on the eve of Obama’s inauguration, President Bush issued a National Security Presidential Directive on Arctic Regional Policy. It affirmed as a priority the preservation of U.S. military vessel and aircraft mobility and transit throughout the Arctic, including the Northwest Passage, and foresaw greater capabilities to protect U.S. borders in the Arctic. The Bush administration’s disastrous eight years in office, particularly its decision to withdraw from the ABM treaty and deploy missile defence interceptors and a radar station in Eastern Europe, have greatly contributed to the instability we are seeing today, even though the Obama administration has scaled back the planned deployments. The Arctic has figured in this renewed interest in Cold War weapons systems, particularly the upgrading of the Thule Ballistic Missile Early Warning System radar in Northern Greenland for ballistic missile defence. The Canadian government, as well, has put forward new military capabilities to protect Canadian sovereignty claims in the Arctic, including proposed ice-capable ships, a northern military training base and a deep-water port. Earlier this year Denmark released an all-party defence position paper that suggests the country should create a dedicated Arctic military contingent that draws on army, navy and air force assets with shipbased helicopters able to drop troops anywhere. Danish fighter planes would be tasked to patrol Greenlandic airspace. Last year Norway chose to buy 48 Lockheed Martin F-35 fighter jets, partly because of their suitability for Arctic patrols. In March, that country held a major Arctic military practice involving 7,000 soldiers from 13 countries in which a fictional country called Northland seized offshore oil rigs. The manoeuvres prompted a protest from Russia – which objected again in June after Sweden held its largest northern military exercise since the end of the Second World War. About 12,000 troops, 50 aircraft and several warships were involved. Jayantha Dhanapala, President of Pugwash and former UN under-secretary for disarmament affairs, summarized the situation bluntly: “From those in the international peace and security sector, deep concerns are being expressed over the fact that two nuclear weapon states – the United States and the Russian Federation, which together own 95 per cent of the nuclear weapons in the world – converge on the Arctic and have competing claims. These claims, together with those of other allied NATO countries – Canada, Denmark, Iceland, and Norway – could, if unresolved, lead to conflict escalating into the threat or use of nuclear weapons.” Many will no doubt argue that this is excessively alarmist, but no circumstance in which nuclear powers find themselves in military confrontation can be taken lightly. The current geo-political threat level is nebulous and low – for now, according to Rob Huebert of the University of Calgary, “the issue is the uncertainty as Arctic states and non-Arctic states begin to recognize the geo-political/economic significance of the Arctic because of climate change.”

The United States Securities and Exchange Commission should rule that equity or debt-based crowdfunding for commercial integral fast reactors is not subject to registration requirements under the Securities Act. 

In lieu of registration, entities that initiate an equity or debt-based crowdfunding project for commercial integral fast reactors must notify the SEC of their project, clearly publish investment risk warnings on the appropriate crowdfunding platforms, and make their crowdfunding platforms open to the general public with some means for investors to communicate freely and openly about offerings.

The SEC should clarify that a “qualified purchaser,” as per Section 18(b)(3) of the Securities Act, means anyone who makes a purchase allowed by the above crowdfunding exemption.

Today Mosaic, an Oakland startup, announced that it is going national in its effort to raise money from online investors to fund rooftop solar systems. It is, in a sense, the first crowdfunded green investment firm. Says Co-founder Billy Parish, who previously had launched the Energy Action Coalition, a non-profit that gets youth involved in clean energy and climate solutions, &amp;#34;We&amp;#39;re creating a new platform where people can profit from the clean energy revolution.&amp;#34; Each investor in Mosaic is promised a return on his or her investment, typically around 4% to 6% a year over 5 years. So far Mosaic has raised $1.1 million from 400 individuals to fund the installation of solar systems on twelve projects including a $40,000 system on a building housing an Oakland non-profit called the Youth Employment Partnership. Mosaic keeps a fee of 1% of the money raised, and its investors get a fixed return. The two year-old company, which in addition to the money it has raised online, has received $3.4 million in seed money from San Francisco-based venture capitalist Sunil Paul of Spring Venture as well as others. Mosaic also got a $2 million Department of Energy grant in June 2012. Now it wants to scale. But there&amp;#39;s a problem: the Securities and Exchange Commission. It&amp;#39;s one thing to solicit small amounts of money from individuals and groups Mosaic knew. It&amp;#39;s another to start peddling hundreds of millions in equity to the general public over the Internet. Wanting to help entrepreneurs create jobs, Congress as part of the JOBS ACT created a provision for &amp;#34;cloud funding portals.&amp;#34; President Obama signed it into law in April of 2012 and gave the SEC a deadline to create rules and guidelines to protect investors who want to invest in online outfits like Mosaic. The SEC has yet to issue their regulations. In the meantime Mosaic has done an end run around the SEC by working with state securities laws. It can now offer its investment to anyone in California or New York. In the other states, investors have to be &amp;#34;accredited&amp;#34; which means hefty net worth and income requirements. (A net worth of over $1 million excluding one&amp;#39;s house and an annual income of over $200,000.) If the SEC eventually approves cloud funding portals, investment companies like Mosaic could go national without registering in each state. If cloud funding gets the green light, it could eventually disrupt a financing model that so far has been the purview of big banks. &amp;#34;We like decentralized investing, says Parish, &amp;#34;Individuals can directly invest in clean energy projects and get a great return.&amp;#34; So instead of putting money in the stock market, you&amp;#39;ll be able to invest in companies like Mosaic and maybe even feel good about making the world a bit cleaner.

No spillover ~-~- IFRs too costly and take too long 
Makhijani 1
(Arjun, PhD in engineering and an electrical and nuclear engineer who is President of the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research. Makhijani has written many books and reports analyzing the safety, economics, and efficiency of various energy sources. He has testified before Congress and has served as an expert witness in Nuclear Regulatory Commission proceedings, “Letters to the Editor” Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, May 2001 vol. 57 no. 3 4-5)

As for IFRs, the 1996 National Academy of Sciences (NAS) study cited by Stanford concluded that there were several safety issues that remain to be resolved and that using advanced sodium-cooled reactors for transmutation “would require substantial development, testing, and large-scale demonstration under Nuclear Regulatory Commission safety review and licensing before one could proceed with confidence.” Even if all the technical problems posed by IFRs were to be solved, the costs of using this technology would be prohibitive. In the United States alone, IFRs would have to fission roughly 80,000 metric tons of heavy metal (about 99 percent of which is uranium). To transmute this amount of heavy metal over 40 years would require the building of about 2,000 IFRs of 1,000-megawatts capacity each. To manage the worldwide stock of spent fuel (both current and projected) in this way would require roughly four times as many reactors. Even assuming that one IFR reactor was brought on line a week, it would take 150 years to build them. The NAS study also expressed skepticism that the reprocessing technology associated with the IFR could be made as economical as its proponents claim. The IFR requirement of collocating the reprocessing element with the reactor would result in even higher costs because of the small scale of collocated plants. NAS&amp;#39;s conclusion that there would be a 2 to 7 percent increase in electricity costs was based on low reactor costs and transmutation costs that were “likely to be no less than $50 billion and easily could be over $100 billion” for 600 metric tons of tran-suranics only. If the cost of reprocessing uranium is added, the total cost would increase to $300 billion—$900 billion for the United States alone. It is easy to see why no current transmutation scheme seriously proposes to transmute all the uranium in spent fuel.

Nuclear power is the most expensive technological failure

(Prof-Vermont Law School and Former NRC Member, Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, March/April, “How to close the US nuclear industry: Do nothing,” Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, http://bos.sagepub.com/content/69/2/12.full)

 The United States is on course to all but exit the commercial nuclear power industry even if the country awakens to the dangers of climate change and adopts measures to favor low-carbon energy sources. Nuclear power had been in economic decline for more than three decades when the Bush administration launched a program that aimed to spark a nuclear power renaissance through subsidies and a reformed reactor licensing process. But Wall Street was already leery of the historically high costs of nuclear power. An abundance of natural gas, lower energy demand induced by the 2008 recession, increased energy-efficiency measures, nuclear’s rising cost estimates, and the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station further diminished prospects for private investment in new US nuclear plants. Without additional and significant governmental preferences for new nuclear construction, market forces will all but phase out the US nuclear fleet by midcentury. Here’s what the US government must do to bring about a gradual phase-out of almost all US nuclear power plants: absolutely nothing. The United States is more or less on course to exit the commercial nuclear power industry, even if the country awakens to the dangers of climate change and adopts broad-based measures to favor low-carbon energy sources. Only a massive, government-driven infusion of taxpayer or customer dollars, targeted specifically to new nuclear reactors, will produce a different result.

But there is little evidence yet that either the government or the Commission is fully alert to the most momentous truth of the present era: Our best science now predicts that nuclear arsenals are fundamentally incompatible with continued human existence. It is imperative that the message coming from scientists in the US, Russia and elsewhere about the environmental consequences of nuclear war be included in the general debate about the control and abolition of nuclear weapons. Unfortunately, the nuclear weapon states apparently remain oblivious to the climatic, ecological and biological consequences of nuclear war. No &amp;#34;environmental impact statement&amp;#34; has ever been created for the US or Russian nuclear weaponry, which is one of the reasons why there still are 22,000 intact nuclear weapons in their deployed and reserve arsenals. However, new peer-reviewed studies done at several US universities predict the detonation of even a tiny fraction of the global nuclear arsenal will result in major changes in the global climate and massive destruction of the stratospheric ozone layer (which protects the Earth from deadly UV light). Even a &amp;#34;regional&amp;#34; nuclear conflict between India and Pakistan, fought with 100 Hiroshima-size weapons, is predicted to loft five million tons of smoke above cloud level; there it would block about 10 per cent of warming sunlight from reaching the surface of the Northern Hemisphere. This would produce average surface temperatures colder than any experienced for the last 1000 years. The smoke would remain in the stratosphere for more than a decade and seriously impact global climate. It would probably be too cold to grow wheat in Canada for several years; grain exports would likely cease from grain-exporting nations .and global nuclear famine would result, Within a few years, most of the already-hungry human populations could perish, and the populations of any nation dependent upon grain imports would be at risk.

Arctic war likely—numerous scenarios their D doesn’t answer
Gurbanov, 10/3
(Analyst-Strategic Outlook Think-Tank, “The Arctic: Venue of Geopolitical Wars?,” http://cesran.org/index.php?option=com_contentandview=articleandid=1512%3Athe-arctic-venue-of-geopolitical-wars-andcatid=58%3Amakale-ve-raporlarandItemid=99andlang=en)

The Russian Arctic nature is specific with high sensitivity and exposure to man-made impacts. The groups of Greenpeace activists, who include Greenpeace Executive Director Kumi Naidoo (from South Africa), were criticizing oil and gas development on Russia’s Arctic shelf (Prirazlomnaya platform). Environmental groups have repeatedly criticized Gazprom for failing to publish their full “oil spill response plan” for the platform, saying that no technology yet exists to clean up oil spills in icy conditions and that even a small accident could be catastrophic for the Arctic ecosystem. There are protected natural areas, home to endangered species such as walruses and beluga whales, just 50 to 60 kilometers from the platform. Furthermore, Arctic ice caps also very rapidly getting melted. One can see an ice-free North Pole after several decades. Naidoo also wrote in his blog that “Gazprom is set to begin dangerous drilling on the Arctic shelf with no viable oil spill response plan”. Gazprom-Neft Shelf has rejected claims that the platform is a threat to the environment, claiming the platform’s performance last winter proved its reliability and that professional emergency response crews are on duty 24 hours within a day. Konstantin Simonov, head of Russia’s National Energy Security Fund in Moscow, told that “it will be difficult for an organization like Greenpeace to stop Russia’s Arctic plans. But, Russian companies must begin dialogue with them. It’s a good experience for Gazprom, but these actions will not stop and will not change the state policy of Russia in Arctic zone”. Arctic oil exploration is vital to sustaining Russia’s long-term status as the world’s top oil producer. Russia’s oil and gas production in western Siberia is declining. It means that Russia needs to find the alternative fields. Russian President Vladimir Putin has made the exploration of Russia’s Arctic reserves a strategic priority of Government. Now the Arctic is a national project and Russia will support it and is ready to invest for implementation of that project and the Greenpeace’s actions will not be able to stop Putin’s desire to begin the production of oil and gas in Arctic. It seems that environmental protection and ecological disasters are not high priorities for Kremlin strategists, who consider the energy sector as the instrument which Moscow can use to cement its position as a superpower both in the region and the world. Recently, Russia started the construction of one of Russia’s new generation submarines and Putin vowed to boost nuclear naval forces to guarantee the country’s position as a leading sea power. Putin said that Russia’s navy would protect Russia’s interests in the energy-rich Arctic zone. This is obviously means the militarization of Arctic, and Russia is also a part of this process. Not only Russia, as well as increasing military presence of United States and Canada in this area. The problem is very simple because Arctic states (Russia, United States, Canada, Norway and Denmark) still have no decision to divide the Arctic. Prirazlomnoye is on Russian part of Arctic. But there are still a lot of grey zones and there are still a lot of questions. The shipyards in Severodvinsk, on the White Sea, where nuclear submarines were built, have turned attentions to assembling drilling platforms. One was just recently assembled for use at the Prirazlomnoye oilfield in the Pechora Sea. The enormous metal construction, operated by a subsidiary of Russian energy giant Gazprom, is expected to start drilling operations in the coming months. In this regard, U.S. frequently emphasizes the importance of providing the marine security in the Arctic by U.S. Armed Forces. Because, Northwest Passage is the shortest way to deliver the energy resources of Arctic to Asia, Europe and Pacific coasts of the U.S. In 2007, Russia declared to establish Arctic Military Unit to protect the Northern continental shelf (the future energy reserves until 2020). Last year (2011), Russian Defence Minister Anatoly Serdyukov announced that Russia intends to create two new military brigades (with 10.000 troops) to protect its interests in the Arctic. The energy potential of the Arctic is a major driver behind Moscow’s decisions. The most of the proved oil reserves in the region are within the 200-mile economic limits of Russia and Canada. Canada, Denmark and China highlighted the significance of this question as well. Yet there are currently not an official Chinese Arctic strategy, which outlines China’s regional interests, political approaches, and legal positions in the near-term. However, over the past ten years, China has developed a serious interest in Arctic science, structured along four main axes: oceanography, biology, atmospheric science, and glaciology. The development of Arctic shipping routes is the driving factor of China’s Arctic interest, as the access to Arctic shipping routes could profoundly impact the country’s future trade and shipping patterns. Arctic Ocean offers China not only substantial commercial opportunities in terms of distance savings, but more importantly allows it to diversify its supply and trade routes. Because, China’s economy depends highly on the Strait of Malacca and the China’s economic development relies on secure access to its maritime communication lines. The geo-economics considerations, especially the access to natural resources and Arctic shipping lanes are the true driver of China’s regional policy. China’s rapidly growing energy demand requires country to find alternative routes and sources. Although China’s influence is thus far limited to political and economic power, the United States – which has historically seen the Pacific as its sphere of influence – worries about Beijing’s long-term intentions and involvement in the Arctic region in terms of naval expansion. Because, the Arctic is considered as European, North American and Russian strategic space. NATO also didn’t late to make a statement on the competition for the energy resources of Arctic. NATO says that Arctic region might be potential armed conflict region in the future among its eight stakeholders because of its energy resources. Thus, since 2007, the disputes over Lomonosov Ridges between Russia and Canada still continue. Arctic is a strategic region for Russia not only for its energy security, as well as for nuclear deterrence capacity. Because, given the satellite radars, missile and anti-missile systems of U.S. and NATO in the world and in space, the best place for Russia for its anti-missile capacity against nuclear strike are the polar ice caps in the Arctic. Russian submarines, under the polar ice caps of Arctic have a great importance in terms of response to prospective nuclear attacks and monitoring of the region.
