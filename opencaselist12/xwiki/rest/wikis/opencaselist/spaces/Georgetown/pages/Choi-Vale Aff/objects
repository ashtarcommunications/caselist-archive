Up until 2007 I worked for Nokia Design, looking after the user-experience for Nokia Nseries, based out of the UK. The potential of mobile and ubiquitous technology is still a huge fascination for me. Through teaching and competition/theory work, I am exploring how digital design is permeating and affecting the environment. I was one of the co-founders and lead designer of Dopplr.com, a service for intelligent travel, and now I’m one of the principals at BERG, a design and invention company.

Our willingness to erase the nuclear memory depends on this logic of NATURALIZATION – responsibility for the nuclear is pushed off onto a sense of historic INEVITABILITY

Holden and I advocate excavation of the resolutional memory of increased nuclear power production through a politics of the countermonument.

The 1AC asks how construct public spaces of memory. We must escape the confines of monumental history~-~-the rigid relationship to the past—such as right wing censure or liberal-humanist appropriation. The solution is not anti-monumentalism which elides the past and makes examination impossible.
Luciano 2004 (Dana, Georgetown English Professor and Max’s Thesis advisor, Arizona Quarterly, Autumn, proquest)
The antebellum inclination to monumentalism developed, as Russ Castronovo has demonstrated, as a

, repudiating the past&amp;#39;s power to dictate the terms of the present.4 

OUR counter-monumental approach refuses the RESOLUTION of right-wing redemption OR liberal sentimentality. We embrace polyvocal relationships to history that reshape our present and open alternative futures

And, their appeals to the neutral rhetoric of fairness and limits traffics in the violence of the nuclear regime which necessarily constrains knowledge

This topic was selected not to spur innovation, but as a comforting exercise in repetition.  Policy debate returns to the same clichéd set of technocratic arguments about energy.  Arguments recycle with only minor changes and no impact on policymakers.&#xD;
&#xD;
It’s probably time to step back and look not for neurotic repetition, but a DIAGNOSIS of larger patterns in the energy resolution’s eternal return.  We want to initiate a debate ABOUT the energy debate.  Let’s start in 79, the first energy resolution.  Instead of just being echoes, let’s actually run it back.&#xD;

The technocratic energy consensus created by Reagan disavowed the antagonism necessary for politics – this ensures dissent is met with uncontrolled violence and error replication&#xD;

&#xD;
Post-democracy as consensus politics… that we shall turn to next.&#xD;
&#xD;
We have to CHANGE THE FRAME to create a democratic DEBATE on solar policy.  The Reagan rollback demonstrates that policy manipulation that doesn’t contest the frame fails.  These artificial constraints strip debate of its educational potential – removing those limits allows a debate that’s both balanced and democratic.  We must START the counterfactual debate EVEN IF the plan is a bad idea&#xD;

Permutation do both – we can recognize both that the USfg should have never taken the land and the reversal of federal energy incentives as problems without explicitly endorsing the way history went down – our entire argument is about the need to reverse those decisions – no time paradox competition – the U.S. exists now – we need to deal with it as such but it’s a question of historical grounding – there’s an infinite chain bad events that go back thousands of years that may have influence the present – intervening in one moment does not deny that we shouldn’t have intervened elsewhere given a specific set of prior conditions

Contingency is good in the context of Native-West relations – alternative pre-supposes society can imagine an alternative history – we need the affirmative to break open static conceptions of history because energy policy analysis is most salient in the squo

Science fiction writers construct an imaginary future; historians attempt to reconstruct the past. Ultimately, both are seeking to understand the present

Thus we present a future history of energy – our narrator, living in the second People~’s Republic of China, recounts the failure of the United States to respond to the crisis presented by global Climate Change during the 21st century and its devastating effect on the planet. Our historian recounts when policymakers concluded that: The United States federal government should substantially reduce restrictions on crude oil production in the United States.

the president of the United States felt unable to move his nation forward.
Meanwhile, climate change was intensifying. In 2010, record-breaking summer heat 
AND
fires, crop failure, and the deaths of livestock and companion animals.
The loss of pet cats and dogs garnered particular attention among wealthy Westerners, but what was anomalous in 2021 soon became the new normal. Even then, political, business, and religious leaders refused to accept that the primary cause was the burning of fossil fuels. A shadow of ignorance and denial had fallen over people who considered themselves children of the Enlightenment. For this reason, we now know this era as the Period of the Penumbra.
It is clear that in the early twenty-first century, immediate steps should have been taken to begin the Great Energy Transition. Staggeringly, the opposite occurred. At the very time that the urgent need for an energy transition became palpable, world production of greenhouse gases increased. This fact is so hard to understand that it calls for a closer look at what we know about this crucial juncture.
In the early Penumbral Period, scientists were accused of being &amp;#34;alarmist&amp;#34; in 
AND
to attend conferences to share and analyze the results of their research.10
Though ridiculed when first introduced, the Sea Level Rise Denial Bill would become the 
AND
which permitted the government to limit speech deemed to represent an imminent threat.
Had scientists exaggerated the threat, inadvertently undermining the evidence that would later vindicate them
AND
sea level rise, and Arctic ice loss, among other parameters.13
It is difficult to understand why humans did not respond appropriately in the early Penumbral 
AND
scholars have pointed to the roots of Western natural science in religious institutions.
In an almost childlike attempt to demarcate their practices from those of older explanatory traditions
AND
&amp;#34;unproven&amp;#34; because they did not adhere to this standard of demonstration.
Historians have long argued about why this standard was accepted, given that it had 
AND
standard for accepting claims of any kind, even those involving imminent threats.
Western scientists built an intellectual culture based on the premise that it was worse to 
AND
history, and the costs that ensued were indeed nearly &amp;#34;all costs.&amp;#34;
By 2012, more than 365 billion tons of carbon had been emitted into the 
AND
enigma were two of the world~’s richest: the United States and Canada.
A key turning point was 2005, when the U.S. Energy Policy 
AND
By 2035, total gas production had exceeded 250 Tcf per annum.19
In the late twentieth century, Canada was considered an advanced nation with a high level of environmental sensitivity.
This changed around the year 2000, when Canada~’s government began to push for development 
AND
but its actual emissions increased more than 30 percent during this period.21
The massive increase in shale gas led to a collapse in the price of natural 
AND
the lock that fossil fuel companies had on energy production and use.23
How did these wealthy nations–rich in the resources that would have enabled an 
AND
their constituents that promoting shale gas was an environmentally and ethically sound approach.
This line of reasoning, however, neglected three crucial factors. First, fugitive 
AND
crossed it. The bridge to the future became a bridge to nowhere.
The net result? Fossil fuel production escalated, greenhouse gas emissions increased, and 
AND
the corresponding temperature rise reached 4 degrees, rapid changes began to ensue.
By 2040, heat waves and droughts were the norm. Control measures such as 
AND
to 15 centimeters around the globe, and coastal populations were mainly intact.
Then, in the Northern Hemisphere summer of 2041, unprecedented heat waves scorched the 
AND
of eligible citizens from its southernmost regions to Scandinavia and the United Kingdom.
While governments were straining to maintain order and provide for their people, leaders in 
AND
and began preparing blueprints for the International Climate Cooling Engineering Project (iccep).
As a first step, iccep launched the International Aerosol Injection Climate Engineering Project (IaICEP, pronounced ay-yi-sep) in 2042.27 IaICEP had widespread support from wealthy nations anxious to preserve some semblance of order, poor nations desperate to see the world do something to address their plight, and frantic low-lying Pacific Island nations at risk of being submerged by rising sea levels.
IaICEP began to inject submicrometersize sulfate particles into the stratosphere at a rate of approximately 
AND
across India, IaICEP~’s most aggressive promoter now called for its immediate cessation.
IaICEP was halted in 2047, but a fatal chain of events had already been 
AND
rebound effect pushed the mean global temperature increase to nearly 5 degrees Celsius.
Whether it was caused by this sudden additional heating or would have happened anyway is 
AND
additional 6 degrees Celsius over the 5 degree rise that had already occurred.
The ultimate blow for Western civilization came in a development that, like so many 
AND
the sheet on the Antarctic mainland, sea level began to rise rapidly.
Social disruption hampered scientific data-gathering, but some dedicated individuals–realizing the 
AND
ensued, adding another two meters to mean global sea level rise.31
Analysts had predicted that a five-meter sea level rise would dislocate 10 percent 
AND
to estimate that 60 to 70 percent of species were driven to extinction.
There is no need to rehearse the details of the human tragedy that occurred; 
AND
human populations of Australia and Africa, of course, were wiped out.
To the historian studying this tragic period of human history, the most astounding fact 
AND
the grip of two inhibiting ideologies: namely, positivism and market fundamentalism.
Twentieth-century scientists saw themselves as the descendants of an empirical tradition often referred 
AND
crucial economic and technological policies that drove the continued use of fossil fuels.
A key attribute of the period was that power did not reside in the hands 
AND
it calmly and clearly), the world would take steps to avert disaster.

The politics of climate denialism is ethically bankrupt – it allows those who are least affected to engage in the most dangerous decisions
Brown 2008

A common point of attack of the skeptics is the climate change models that are 
AND
not use scientific uncertainty as justification for non-action on climate change.

Affirmation of our story is critical—our dystopian future-historical approach is critical to prevent the sublimination inherent in other approaches

Two novels that strongly reflect just such a concern are Whitley Strieber and James Kunctka~’s 
AND
also both share a concern for the third major topic: ecological devastation. 

That enables agency—the status quo results in the collapse of all political action—only a reinvigoration of science fiction stories can create new paradigms and possibilities
Jonathan **McCalmont**, Author, 10/3/20**12**, Cowardice, Laziness and Irony: How Science Fiction Lost the Future, ruthlessculture.com/2012/10/03/cowardice-laziness-and-irony-how-science-fiction-lost-the-future/
While many of these books are excellent examples of their styles of writing, I cannot help but yearn for books that plunge us into the world rather than aid our flight from it. The thing that unites humanity is not the trappings of popular culture, but the realities of a world that needs to be both confronted and understood if it is ever to change.
It is now almost a cliché to say that we are living in a science fictional world but it is genuinely astonishing to think about how much science fiction writers have got right over the years:
Every morning, I sit at my desk and fire up a Twitter client that 
AND
social and psychological changes heralded by such a radically different types of community.
Having grown afraid of the political repercussions of putting soldiers in harm~’s way, American 
AND
a fantastical backdrop similar to that of Vernor Vinge~’s Zones of Thought series.
I used the examples of Doctorow and Banks as both are writers whose careers have 
AND
genre seize this historic opportunity and rediscover its heritage of engagement and prediction.
Part of what makes this moment so special is the fact that we have seen cracks appear in the façade of neoliberalism. Francis Fukuyama once wrote of the end of history having been achieved but the economic, social and political turbulence engulfing the world make it clear that history is very much alive and kicking.
The challenge facing contemporary science fiction is to widen the cracks and to peer through 
AND
possible future that is currently deemed unthinkable.  As Mark fisher puts it:
    The long dark night of the end of history has to be grasped as 
AND
a situation in which nothing can happen, suddenly anything is possible again.
My greatest source of optimism for the future of science fiction lays in the fact 
AND
to cling to their old lifestyles as the world fell apart around them.
In The Day of the Triffids (1951) Wyndham describes middle-class people 
AND
inhuman monsters that must be destroyed lest their difference taint the entire planet.
Looking back on Wyndham~’s work, it is easy to laugh at the astonishing narrow
AND
period of intense social unrest, a period very similar to our own.
We are living through a period of instability.  As government and businesses teeter on 
AND
has the term ~’cosy catastrophe~’ seemed more fitting than it does today.
Just as Joe Haldeman once used science fictional tropes to process the experience of returning 
AND
, science fiction can provide humanity with its first draft of future history.


Action on energy policy requires a disruption of traditional deliberatory politics and attention to the performative elements of advocacy – this trumps the technocratic fantasy of purely rational consensus
