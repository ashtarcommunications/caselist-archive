Steinberg, lecturer of communication studies – University of Miami, and Freeley, Boston based attorney who focuses on criminal, personal injury and civil rights law, ‘8

Is the defendant guilty as accused? Tlie Daily Show or the ball game? 
AND
do we sort through it and select the best information for our needs?
The ability of every decision maker to make good, reasoned, and ethical decisions relies heavily upon their ability to think critically. Critical thinking enables one to break argumentation down to its component parts in order to evaluate its relative validity and strength. Critical thinkers are better users of information, as well as better advocates.
Colleges and universities expect their students to develop their critical thinking skills and may require students to take designated courses to that end. The importance and value of such study is widely recognized.
Much of the most significant communication of our lives is conducted in the form of debates. These may take place in intrapersonal communications, in which we weigh the pros and cons of an important decision in our own minds, or they may take place in interpersonal communications, in which we listen to arguments intended to influence our decision or participate in exchanges to influence the decisions of others.
Our success or failure in life is largely determined by our ability to make wise

Decisionmaking skills and engagement with the state energy apparatus prevents energy technocracy and actualizes radical politics
Hager, professor of political science – Bryn Mawr College, ‘92
(Carol J., “Democratizing Technology: Citizen and State in West German Energy Politics, 1974-1990” Polity, Vol. 25, No. 1, p. 45-70)

During this phase, the citizen initiative attempted to overcome its defensive posture and implement 
AND
. Thus, local activists met to discuss forming their own voting list.
These discussions provoked internal dissent. Many citizen initiative members objected to the idea of 
AND
politics themselves; self-determination was the aim of their activity.48
Once in parliament, the AL proposed establishment of a temporary parliamentary commission to study 
AND
forum they sought to push for modernization and technical innovation in energy policy.
Although it had scaled down the proposed new plant, the utility had produced no

policy motivated policy makers to take stronger positions in favor of environmental protection.
III. Conclusion 
The West Berlin energy project eventually cleared all planning hurdles, and construction began in 
AND
particular projects was a reaction against the administrative-economic system in general.
One author, for example, describes the emergence of two-dimensional protest against 
AND
as the more important and in many ways the more prob-lematic.
Parliamentary Politics 
In the 1970s, energy politics began to develop in the direction Offe de-
AND
and fundamentally change it, to restore the link between bureaucracy and citizenry.
Parliamentary politics was partially revived in the eyes of West German grassroots groups as a 
AND
they have a chance to implement at least some parts of their program. 
This internal debate, which has never been resolved, can be interpreted in different 
AND
by grassroots groups and parties keeps questions of democracy on the public agenda.
Technical Debate 
In West Berlin, the two-dimensionality of the energy issue forced citizen activists to become both participants in and critics of the policy process. In order to defeat the plant, activists engaged in technical debate. They won several decisions in favor of environmental protection, often proving to be more informed than bureaucratic experts themselves. The case study demonstrates that grassroots groups, far from impeding techno-logical advancement, can actually serve as technological innovators. 
The activists&amp;#39; role as technical experts, while it helped them achieve some success on 
AND
much influenced by the choices of policy makers as by independent technical criteria. 
Submission to the form and language of technical debate, however, weakened activists&amp;#39; attempts 
AND
raised the possibility of a dialogue that is both technically sophisticated and democratic.
In sum, although the legitimation problems which gave rise to grass-roots protest have not been resolved, citizen action has worked to counter the marginalization of parliamentary politics and the technocratic character of policy debate that Offe and Habermas identify. The West Berlin case suggests that the solutions to current legitimation problems may not require total repudiation of those things previously associated with technocracy.56
In Berlin, the citizen initiative and AL continue to search for new, more 
AND
a space for a delibera-tive politics in modern technological society.61
