A. Interpretation – The affirmative must affirm the topic instrumentally. The 1AC must include a topical plan that is only justified with a normative defense of federal government adoption of such a policy.  The ballot only declares that the resolution is either true or false.

The topic is defined by the phrase following the colon – the USFG is the agent of the resolution, not the individual debaters
Webster’s Guide to Grammar and Writing – 2000  http://ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/marks/colon.htm
Use of a colon before a list or an explanation that is preceded by a clause that can stand by itself. Think of the colon as a gate, inviting one to go on… If the introductory phrase preceding the colon is very brief and the clause following the colon represents the real business of the sentence, begin the clause after the colon with a capital letter.

And the USFG is in Washington D.C.
Encarta World Online Encyclopedia, 2006, 
http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_1741500781/United_States_(Government).html
United States Government, the combination of federal, state, and local laws, bodies, and agencies that is responsible for carrying out the operations of the United States. The federal government of the United States is centered in Washington, D.C.

American Heritage Dictionary – 2000 www.dictionary.com

B. Violation – The affirmative is not an instrumental affirmation of the resolution – they affirm the topic as

C. Reasons to Prefer:
1.  Ground – Refusing to defend the implementation of the plan/resolution erases all predictable negative disad and case ground. We’ll never have evidence saying their specific advocacy of the plan is bad. This eliminates all of our offense since testing their method is key.
2.  Topical Education – By manipulating the topic to access a political project they destroy discussion of the important question asked by the resolution. This tactic promotes debate that is either stagnant or shallow.  This is the best education since it’s the only kind that changes from year to year.
3.  Extra Topicality –they skirt discussion of the plan’s merits by arguing the benefits derived from their advocacy outweigh. This is a voting issue because we’re forced to win framework just to get back to equal footing – extra topicality also proves the resolution insufficient and explodes aff ground.
4. Bad Policymaking – The affirmative subverts discussion of the merits of specific policies, which negates our ability to compare the effects of the plan to the status quo. This ruins a critical function of this activity which is to test the desirability of policy implementation
D. Voting Issue – If we demonstrate the affirmative does not meet the best interpretation of the topic they have failed to justify the resolution and should be rejected. This is the best way to preserve competitive equity by ensuring predictable ground for the negative. 
Also, this is a prerequisite to other arguments. 
Ruth Lesl Shively, Professor of Politics at Texas AandM, 2000 Partisan Politics and Political Theory, p. 181-2
In most cases, however, our agreements are highly imperfect. We agree on some matters but not on others, on generalities but not on specifics, on principles but not on their applications, and so on. And this kind of limited agreement is the starting condition of contest and debate. As John Courtney Murray writes: We hold certain truths; therefore we can argue about them. It seems to have been one of the corruptions of intelligence by positivism to assume that argument ends when agreement is reached. In a basic sense, the reverse is true. There can be no agreement except on the premise, and within a context, of agreement. (Murray 1960, 10) In other words, we cannot argue about something if we are not communicating: if we cannot agree on the topic and terms of argument or if we have utterly different ideas about what counts as evidence or good argument. At the very least, we must agree about what it is that is being debated before we can debate it. For instance, one cannot have an argument about euthanasia with someone who thinks euthanasia is a musical group. One cannot successfully stage a sit-in if one’s target audience simply thinks everyone is resting or if those doing the sitting have no complaints. Nor can one demonstrate resistance to a policy if no one knows that it is a policy. In other words, contest is meaningless if there is a lack of agreement or communication about what is being contested. Registers, demonstrators, and debaters must have some shared ideas about the subject and/or terms of their disagreements. The participants and the target of a sit-in must share an understanding of the complaint at hand. And a demonstrator’s audience must know what is being resisted. In short, the contesting of an idea presumes some agreement about what that idea is and how one might go about intelligibly contesting it. In other words, contestation rests on some basic agreement or harmony.

Increase means to make a quantity larger - wiktionary
en.wiktionary.org/wiki/increase:
An amount by which a quantity is increased; For a quantity, the act or process of becoming larger; to become larger; To make (a quantity) larger
This is key to neg ground – failure to defend an increase makes it impossible to go negative. No link to ANY disadvantage or kritik. The aff is also a negative counterplan.
2. The plan must increase a financial incentive or remove a restriction
key to neg ground – links to core disads and kritiks are based on the mechanism of the plan – the aff subverts the entirety of this debate and makes it impossible to go negative. Can’t read a counterplan because because there is nothing to counterplan out of.
Destroy topic education – the mechanism is a key question of topic education – aff avoids the entirety of that debate.
3. Energy –
The topic listed the types of energy, Invisible wasn’t one of them.
Key to limits – the aff removes EVERY limit on the topic – allows for an increase in any kind of any. THOUSANDS of possible affirmatives. Hydro, kinetic, potential, Space solar power, anus solar power. They are entirely unpredicatable and impossible to debate since we would only research the energy listed in the topic;.
Ground – we don’t have link ground to an energy that wasn’t in the topic

7 FAM 1112 WHAT IS BIRTH “IN THE UNITED STATES”? (CT:CON-314; 08-21-2009) a. INA 101(a)(38) (8 U.S.C. 1101 (a)(38)) provides that “the term „United States,‟ when used in a geographical sense, means the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands of the United States.” U.S. Department of State Foreign Affairs Manual Volume 7 - Consular Affairs 7 FAM 1110 Page 4 of 13 b. On November 3, 1986, Public Law 94-241, “approving the Covenant to Establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Political Union with the United States of America”, (Section 506(c)),took effect. From that point on, the Northern Mariana Islands have been treated as part of the United States for the purposes of INA 301 (8 U.S.C. 1401) and INA 308 (8 U.S.C. 1408). (See 7 FAM 1120 Acquisition of U.S. Nationality in U.S. Territories and Possessions.) c. The Nationality Act of 1940 (NA), Section 101(d) (54 Statutes at Large 1172) (effective January 13, 1941 until December 23, 1952) provided that “the term „United States‟ when used in a geographical sense means the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands of the United States.” The 1940 Act did not include Guam or the Northern Mariana Islands as coming within the definition of “United States.” See the text of the 1940 Act on the CA/OCS Intranet, Acquisition of Citizenship, Legal and Regulatory Documents. d. Prior to January 13, 1941, there was no statutory definition of “the United States” for citizenship purposes. The phrase “in the United States” as used in Section 1993 of the Revised Statues of 1878 clearly includes states that have been admitted to the Union. (See 7 FAM 1119 b.) e. INA 304 (8 U.S.C. 1404) and INA 305 (8 U.S.C. 1405) provide a basis for citizenship of persons born in Alaska and Hawaii, respectively, while they were territories of the United States. f. See 7 FAM 1100 Appendix B (under development) for guidance as to what constitutes evidence of birth in the United States. 7 FAM 1113 NOT INCLUDED IN THE MEANING OF &amp;#34;IN THE UNITED STATES&amp;#34; (CT:CON-314; 08-21-2009) a. Birth on U.S. Registered Vessel On High Seas or in the Exclusive Economic Zone: A U.S.-registered or documented ship on the high seas or in the exclusive economic zone is not considered to be part of the United States. Under the law of the sea, an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) is a maritime zone over which a State has special rights over the exploration and use of natural resources. The Exclusive Economic Zone extends up to 200 nautical miles from the coastal baseline. A child born on such a vessel does not acquire U.S. citizenship by reason of the place of birth (Lam Mow v. Nagle, 24 F.2d 316 (9th Cir., 1928)). U.S. Department of State Foreign Affairs Manual Volume 7 - Consular Affairs 7 FAM 1110 Page 5 of 13 NOTE: This concept of allotting nations EEZs to give better control of maritime affairs outside territorial limits gained acceptance in the late 20th century and was given binding international recognition by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) in 1982. Part V, Article 55 of the Convention states: Specific legal regime of the Exclusive Economic Zone: The Exclusive Economic Zone is an area beyond and adjacent to the territorial sea, subject to the specific legal regime established in this Part, under which the rights and jurisdiction of the coastal State and the rights and freedoms of other States are governed by the relevant provisions of this Convention. b. A U.S.-registered aircraft outside U.S. airspace is not considered to be part of U.S. territory. A child born on such an aircraft outside U.S. airspace does not acquire U.S. citizenship by reason of the place of birth. NOTE: The United States of America is not a party to the U.N. Convention on Reduction of Statelessness (1961). Article 3 of the Convention does not apply to the United States. Article 3 provides “For the purpose of determining the obligations of Contracting States under this Convention, birth on a ship or in an aircraft shall be deemed to have taken place in the territory of the State whose flag the ship flies or in the territory of the State in which the aircraft is registered, as the case may be.” This is a frequently asked question. c. Birth on U.S. Military Base Outside of the United States or Birth on U.S. Embassy or Consulate Premises Abroad: (1) Despite widespread popular belief, U.S. military installations abroad and U.S. diplomatic or consular facilities abroad are not part of the United States within the meaning of the 14th Amendment. A child born on the premises of such a facility is not born in the United States and does not acquire U.S. citizenship by reason of birth. (2) The status of diplomatic and consular premises arises from the rules of law relating to immunity from the prescriptive and enforcement jurisdiction of the receiving State; the premises are not part of the territory of the United States of America. (See Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law, Vol. 1, Sec. 466, Comment a and c (1987). See also, Persinger v. Iran, 729 F.2d 835 (D.C. Cir. 1984). U.S. Department of State Foreign Affairs Manual Volume 7 - Consular Affairs 7 FAM 1110 Page 6 of 13 d. Birth on Foreign Ships In Foreign Government Non-Commercial Service: (1) A child born on a foreign merchant ship or privately owned vessel in U.S. internal waters is considered as having been born subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. (See U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark.) (2) Foreign warships, naval auxiliaries, and other vessels or aircraft owned or operated by a State and used for governmental non-commercial service are not subject to jurisdiction of the United States. Persons born on such vessels while in U.S. internal waters (or, of course, anywhere else) do not acquire U.S. citizenship by virtue of place of birth. e. Alien Enemies During Hostile Occupation: (1) If part of the United States were occupied by foreign armed forces against the wishes of the United States, children born to enemy aliens in the occupied areas would not be subject to U.S. jurisdiction and would not acquire U.S. citizenship at birth. (2) Children born to persons other than enemy aliens in an area temporarily occupied by hostile forces would acquire U.S. citizenship at birth because sovereignty would not have been transferred to the other country. (See U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark.) 7 FAM 1114 BIRTH IN U.S. INTERNAL WATERS AND TERRITORIAL SEA (CT:CON-407; 06-29-2012) a. Persons born on ships located within U.S. internal waters (except as provided in section 1113 d above) are considered to have been born in the United States. Such persons will acquire U.S. citizenship at birth if they are subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. Internal waters include the ports, harbors, bays, and other enclosed areas of the sea along the U.S. coast. As noted above, a child born on a foreign merchant ship or privately owned vessel in U.S. internal waters is considered as having been born subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. (See U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark.) b. Twelve Nautical Mile Limit: The territorial sea of the United States was formerly three nautical miles. (See, e.g., Cunard S.S. Co. v Mellon, 262 U.S. 100, 122, 43 S. Ct. 504, 67 L. Ed. 894 (1923).) However, the three-mile rule was changed by a Presidential Proclamation in 1988, implementing the territorial-sea provision of the 1982 U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea. (Presidential Proclamation 5928, signed December U.S. Department of State Foreign Affairs Manual Volume 7 - Consular Affairs 7 FAM 1110 Page 7 of 13 27, 1988, published at 54 Federal Register 777, January 9, 1989.) As decreed by that Proclamation, the territorial sea of the United States henceforth extends to 12 nautical miles from the baselines of the United States determined in accordance with international law. (The Proclamation also stated that the jurisdiction of the United States extends to the airspace over the territorial sea.) (See Gordon, Immigration Law and Procedure, Part 8 Nationality and Citizenship, 92.03(2)(b) territorial limits.) c. FAM guidance up until 1995 (7 FAM 1116.1-2 In U.S. Waters TL:CON-64; 11-30-95) advised that persons born within the 3-mile limit of the U.S. territorial sea were born “within the United States” and could be documented as U.S. citizens if they were also born subject to U.S. jurisdiction. Some commentators took this view as well, such as Gordon. Analysis of this issue undertaken in 1994-1995 revealed, however, that there is a substantial legal question whether persons born outside the internal waters of the United States but within the territorial sea are in fact born “within the United States” for purposes of the 14th Amendment and the INA. Note: Cases involving persons born outside the internal waters but within the U.S. territorial sea should therefore be submitted to the Department (CA/OCS) for adjudication, upon coordination by CA/OCS/L with L/CA and L/OES and other appropriate offices within the United States Government. U.S. Embassies and Consulates abroad should consult CA/OCS/L (Ask-OCS-L-Dom-Post@state.gov). Domestic U.S. passport agencies and centers should contact CA/PPT/L/LA (CAPPTAdjQ@state.gov), which will confer with CA/OCS/L and L/CA.
Violation – the plan does not say in the United States –This could mean territories or properties outside of the US
Standards
Limits – aff explodes the topic, would allow for a host of unpredictable affirmatives that expand the research burden and make going negative impossible; such as nuclear reactors on aircraft carriers, energy on bases outside of the US, modifying foreign properties, arctic circle oil drilling outside of our EEZ. Our US department of state evidence specifically excludes these affs.
Ground – no disad links are possible. Cant win core disads such as energy industry tradeoff, or links to core generics like politics and elections because the plan happens outside of the US. The aff would argue it doesn’t affect the domestic industry and isn’t perceived
Topical version of the affirmative – the plan would be “Thus we advocate and unrestricted affirmation of invisible energy in the United States”

Topicality should be viewed through competing interpretations and is a voting issue for fairness and education.
These are all separate violations that we can extend independent of one another at any point in the debate.

HOAs are not governed by federal law
New York Attorney General 2008
http://www.ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/pdfs/bureaus/real_estate_finance/HOA%20problems.pdf
Members of homeowners associations who are unhappy with how their¶ association is acting (or not acting) often do not know what they can do. This paper is designed to tell such homeowners about some of their rights. In most cases there is no government agency that can help unhappy owners who are having problems with their homeowners association (HOA). The Attorney¶ General&amp;#39;s office regulates only the offer and sale of real estate securities (which includes¶ interests in HOAs). It generally does not become involved in owners’ problems with boards¶ of directors after the sponsor is no longer in control of the board. However, this office may¶ be able to help you if the sponsor of the HOA is not keeping the commitments which it¶ made in the offering plan. If this is the case, owners may contact the Attorney General by¶ sending a letter to: ¶ Real Estate Finance Bureau, ¶ New York State Department of Law, ¶ 120 Broadway (23rd Floor), ¶ New York, N.Y. 10271.¶ As you may know, a homeowners association is an organization established¶ to govern a private community. Typically it owns and manages some common property for¶ owners of private houses or condominium units. By buying a lot and/or home, an owner¶ automatically becomes a member of the HOA of which it is a part. Before offering to sell¶ memberships, a sponsor must file an offering plan with the Attorney General if sales of¶ individual homes, lots or condo units are involved, unless it is exempted by law or¶ regulation.¶ Most HOAs are corporations established under the Not-for-Profit Corporation¶ Law. An HOA is similar to other corporations ~-~- it is governed by a board of directors¶ elected by the members and a set of rules called by-laws. Books and records of financial transactions must be kept, taxes paid, and certain services provided to members. Usually the board has an annual budget prepared to estimate expenses, and then assesses each member a share of the costs.

Limits - Allowing the aff to remove restrictions on homeowners associations allows a litany of unpredictable affirmatives. They could remove county or city restrictions or any private actor such as businesses, retirement communities, private schools etc. The possibilities are endless and unpredictable. Multiplied by 6 different energies and multiple possible restrictions on each makes it impossible to negate.

Ground – neg cannot win a disadvantage to the removal of private organizations restrictions. There is no literature against the case because it is something that can’t be done

Solvency – our New York Attorney General 2008 evidence also means the aff can’t solve. The federal government cannot remove a restriction of state governments or private entities. The aff does nothing. Vote neg on presumption.

Topicality is a voting issue for fairness and education. Should be viewed through competing interpretations.
