Renaissance Adv
US nuclear renaissance inevitable- only way to meet demand is government subsidies
Worthington 2012 (David Worthington, February 9, 2012, The U.S. nuclear renaissance has begun  , Smart Planet, http://www.smartplanet.com/blog/intelligent-energy/the-us-nuclear-renaissance-has-begun/13058) JD
There are cooling towers on the horizon in the United States. The nuclear renaissance 
AND
million homes at a cost of US$14 billion, CNN reported.

Global cooperation has restored public faith in nuclear energy; Fukushima doesn’t matter
WNA 11 (World Nuclear Association, The Nuclear Renaissance  , August 2011, http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf104.html) JD
The 1986 Chernobyl disaster marked the nadir of public support for nuclear power. However
AND
been any harm or hazard to anyone on account of those from nuclear power

Scenario 1: Meltdowns 
Old reactor types make meltdowns inevitable – reactors have shut down in the past and the NRC has failed at regulation
Gronlund 2007 (Nuclear power in a Warming world: Assessing the Risks, Addressing the Challenges, Lisbeth Gronlund;  David Lochbaum;  Edwin Lyman, Union of Concerned Scientists, http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/nuclear_power/nuclear-power-in-a-warming-world.pdf) JD
Safety problems remain despite a lack of   serious accidents.   A serious nuclear power accident 
AND
problems so extensive that a year or more is   needed to fix them.

SMRs solve
Wheeler 10 (November 22, 2010, “Small Modular Reactors May Offer Significant Safety and Security Enhancements”, John Wheeler, Clear Trend, http://thisweekinnuclear.com/?p=1193) JD
Even better, most SMRs are small enough that they cannot over heat and melt 
AND
and lower operating costs (a smaller footprint means a smaller security force). 

Meltdowns cause extinction
Lendman, 2011
(Stephen, Research Associate of the Centre for Research on Globalization, 03/ 13, “Nuclear Meltdown in Japan,”, The People’s Voice http://www.thepeoplesvoice.org/TPV3/Voices.php/2011/03/13/nuclear-meltdown-in-japan, accessed 8-2-12, RSR)
Reuters said the 1995 Kobe quake caused $100 billion in damage, up to 
AND
entire region. &amp;#34;It could be, literally, an apocalyptic event.

Scenario 2: Nuclear Terrorism Scenario
Old reactor types make nuke terror inevitable- They’ll steal fissile material
Early, et al., 2009
(Bryan (Former Research Fellow at Harvard’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs), Matthew Fuhrmann (Professor in Political Science at Texas AandM) and Quan Li (Professor in Political Science at Texas AandM), “Atoms for Terror: The Determinants of Nuclear/Radiological Terrorism”, Social Science Research Network, RSR)
The presence and size of a civilian nuclear infrastructure affect terrorist groups’ cost-benefit 
AND
often look for NR materials in the country that they wish to attack.

Terrorists can also use aircrafts and truck bombs to trigger a meltdown. 
Schifman 2010
(Ben, J.D. Candidate at the Columbia School of Law, “The Limits of NEPA:  Consideration of the Impacts of Terrorism in Environmental Impact Statements for Nuclear Facilities, Columbia Journal of Environmental Law, Vol. 35, No. 2, pg. 374, RSR)
Existing nuclear power plants were designed to withstand natural disasters, such as earthquakes, 
AND
term deaths and as many as 518,000 long-term deaths.

SMRs solve - they’re buried underground, heavily layered and no on-site refueling

As to the small reactors themselves, the designs achieve a degree of proliferation-
AND
reactors are mitigated and concerns over the widespread distribution of nuclear fuel allayed.

Nuclear terrorism causes retaliation that sparks global nuclear war and extinction.
Ayson 2010
(Robert, Professor of Strategic Studies and Director of the Centre for Strategic Studies: New Zealand –  Victoria University of Wellington, “After a Terrorist Nuclear Attack: Envisaging Catalytic Effects”, Studies in Conflict and Terrorism, 33(7), July)
But these two nuclear worlds—a non-state actor nuclear attack and a 
AND
be admitted that any preemption would probably still meet with a devastating response.

Leadership Adv
The commercial industry is the key internal link to nuclear leadership – federal investment is key
Pete Domenici and Warren F. “Pete” Miller, part time Research Professor at Texas A and M University and former assistant secretary for nuclear energy at the U.S. Department of Energy, July 2012, “Maintaining U.S. Leadership in Global Nuclear Energy Markets,” Bipartisan Policy Center,http://bipartisanpolicy.org/sites/default/files/Leadership%20in%20Nuclear%20Energy%20Markets.pdf

As an active participant in commercial markets, the United States has considerable leverage internationally 
AND
jurisdiction over commercial nuclear trade, global safety and security, and nonproliferation. 
Plan key to a robust manufacturing sector in the US that spreads the model around the world
Rosner and Goldberg ‘11

As stated earlier, SMRs have the potential to achieve significant greenhouse gas emission reductions
AND
Japan, Korea, Russia, and, now rapidly emerging, China.
SCENARIO 1: Proliferation
Brink of widespread prolif now
CFR 7-5-2012, “The Global Nuclear Nonproliferation Regime,” Council on Foreign Relations, http://www.cfr.org/proliferation/global-nuclear-nonproliferation-regime/p18984

Nuclear weapons proliferation, whether by state or nonstate actors, poses one of the 
AND
way for &amp;#34;the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons.&amp;#34;

Ensures safe nuclear technology - allows the US to promote non-proliferation objectives, otherwise wildfire prolif is inevitable
Loudermilk 2011

Reactor safety itself notwithstanding, many argue that the scattering of small reactors around the 
AND
standards on nuclear agreements, spent fuel reprocessing, and developing reactor technologies.
 
Proliferations causes extinction – nuclear arms races and miscalculated nuclear war
Utgoff 2’
Utgoff, 2002 (Deputy Director of the Strategy Forces, and Resources Division of the Institute for Defense Analyses, Victor, “Proliferation, Missile Defence, and American Ambitions,” Survival, Volume 44, Number 2, Summer)
First, the dynamics of getting to a highly proliferated world could be very dangerous
AND
a hill to bury the bodies of dead cities or even whole nations.

SCENARIO 2: Tech Leadership
SMRs key to tech leadership – puts the US on the cutting edge of nuclear technology.
Fleischmann, ‘11
(Chuck, Representative from the 3rd District in Tennessee, “Small Modular Reactors Could Help With U.S. Energy Needs”, American Physical Society, Vol. 6, No. 2, October 2011, http://www.aps.org/publications/capitolhillquarterly/201110/backpage.cfm, accessed 8-1-12, RSR)
The timely implementation of small reactors could position the United States on the cutting edge 
AND
strategic position on the forefront of expanding global technologies in the nuclear arena. 

Prefer our internal link – explains the last five centuries of global hegemons
Drezner 2001 Daniel Drezner (professor of international politics at The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University) 2001 “State structure, technological leadership and the maintenance of hegemony” http://www.danieldrezner.com/research/tech.pdf
In this decade, proponents of globalization argue that because information and capital are mobile
AND
leading to a period of strife until a new hegemonic power is found. 

Tech decline will cause heg collapse- US will lashout to retain power
Pape 2009 Robert A. Pape (Professor of Political Science at the University of Chicago) January/February 2009 “The Empire Falls”, The National Interest, June 28, http://www.nationalinterest.org/Article.aspx?id=20484
America is losing its overwhelming technological dominance in the leading industries of the knowledge economy
AND
America&amp;#39;s current, rapid domestic economic decline is merely accelerating our own downfall.

Otherwise – status based great power conflict is inevitable – relative lead key to prevent global conflict
Wohlforth 2009 William C. Wohlforth (a professor of government at Dartmouth College) 2009 “Unipolarity, Status Competition, and Great Power War” Project Muse
Second, I question the dominant view that status quo evaluations are relatively independent of 
AND
ways that directly contradict their material interest in security and/or prosperity.

For if America falters, the world is unlikely to be dominated by a single

Solvency
Nuclear industry is constricting – no new reactors coming online
Pete Domenici and Warren F. “Pete” Miller, part time Research Professor at Texas A and M University and former assistant secretary for nuclear energy at the U.S. Department of Energy, July 2012, “Maintaining U.S. Leadership in Global Nuclear Energy Markets,” Bipartisan Policy Center,http://bipartisanpolicy.org/sites/default/files/Leadership%20in%20Nuclear%20Energy%20Markets.pdf

Prospects for new reactor construction in the United States have constricted significantly in recent years
AND
construction very difficult for at least the next decade, if not longer.
Incentives now takes out their disads
WNN 12 (World Nuclear News, SMR vendors apply for government funds, May 22 2012, 
http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN-SMR_vendors_apply_for_government_funds-2205124.html)
