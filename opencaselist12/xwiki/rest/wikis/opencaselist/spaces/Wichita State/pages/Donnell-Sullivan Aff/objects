Plan: The United States Federal Government should substantially increase market-fixed production cost incentives for domestic deployment of small modular nuclear reactors. 

Renaissance Adv
US nuclear renaissance inevitable- only way to meet demand and government subsidies
Worthington 2012 (David Worthington, February 9, 2012, The U.S. nuclear renaissance has begun  , Smart Planet, http://www.smartplanet.com/blog/intelligent-energy/the-us-nuclear-renaissance-has-begun/13058) JD
There are cooling towers on the horizon in the United States. The nuclear renaissance 
AND
million homes at a cost of US$14 billion, CNN reported.

Global cooperation has restored public faith in nuclear energy; Fukushima doesn’t matter
WNA 11 (World Nuclear Association, The Nuclear Renaissance  , August 2011, http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf104.html) JD
The 1986 Chernobyl disaster marked the nadir of public support for nuclear power. However
AND
been any harm or hazard to anyone on account of those from nuclear power

Scenario 1: Meltdowns 
Old reactor types make meltdowns inevitable – reactors have shut down in the past and the NRC has failed at regulation
Gronlund 2007 (Nuclear power in a Warming world: Assessing the Risks, Addressing the Challenges, Lisbeth Gronlund;  David Lochbaum;  Edwin Lyman, Union of Concerned Scientists, http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/nuclear_power/nuclear-power-in-a-warming-world.pdf) JD
Safety problems remain despite a lack of  serious accidents.   A serious nuclear power accident 
AND
problems so extensive that a year or more is   needed to fix them.

SMRs solve
Wheeler 10 (November 22, 2010, “Small Modular Reactors May Offer Significant Safety and Security Enhancements”, John Wheeler, Clear Trend, http://thisweekinnuclear.com/?p=1193) JD
Even better, most SMRs are small enough that they cannot over heat and melt 
AND
and lower operating costs (a smaller footprint means a smaller security force). 

Meltdowns cause extinction
Lendman, 2011
(Stephen, Research Associate of the Centre for Research on Globalization, 03/ 13, “Nuclear Meltdown in Japan,”, The People’s Voice http://www.thepeoplesvoice.org/TPV3/Voices.php/2011/03/13/nuclear-meltdown-in-japan, accessed 8-2-12, RSR)
Reuters said the 1995 Kobe quake caused $100 billion in damage, up to 
AND
entire region. &amp;#34;It could be, literally, an apocalyptic event.

Scenario 2: Nuclear Terrorism Scenario
Old reactor types make nuke terror inevitable- They’ll steal fissile material
Early, et al., 2009
(Bryan (Former Research Fellow at Harvard’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs), Matthew Fuhrmann (Professor in Political Science at Texas AandM) and Quan Li (Professor in Political Science at Texas AandM), “Atoms for Terror: The Determinants of Nuclear/Radiological Terrorism”, Social Science Research Network, RSR)
The presence and size of a civilian nuclear infrastructure affect terrorist groups’ cost-benefit 
AND
often look for NR materials in the country that they wish to attack.

Terrorists can also use aircrafts and truck bombs to trigger a meltdown. 
Schifman 2010
(Ben, J.D. Candidate at the Columbia School of Law, “The Limits of NEPA:  Consideration of the Impacts of Terrorism in Environmental Impact Statements for Nuclear Facilities, Columbia Journal of Environmental Law, Vol. 35, No. 2, pg. 374, RSR)
Existing nuclear power plants were designed to withstand natural disasters, such as earthquakes, 
AND
term deaths and as many as 518,000 long-term deaths.

SMRs solve - they’re buried underground, heavily layered and no on-site refueling

As to the small reactors themselves, the designs achieve a degree of proliferation-
AND
reactors are mitigated and concerns over the widespread distribution of nuclear fuel allayed.

Nuclear terrorism causes retaliation that sparks global nuclear war and extinction.
Ayson 2010
(Robert, Professor of Strategic Studies and Director of the Centre for Strategic Studies: New Zealand –  Victoria University of Wellington, “After a Terrorist Nuclear Attack: Envisaging Catalytic Effects”, Studies in Conflict and Terrorism, 33(7), July)
But these two nuclear worlds—a non-state actor nuclear attack and a 
AND
be admitted that any preemption would probably still meet with a devastating response.

Leadership Adv
The commercial industry is the key internal link to nuclear leadership – federal investment is key
Pete Domenici and Warren F. “Pete” Miller, part time Research Professor at Texas A and M University and former assistant secretary for nuclear energy at the U.S. Department of Energy, July 2012, “Maintaining U.S. Leadership in Global Nuclear Energy Markets,” Bipartisan Policy Center,http://bipartisanpolicy.org/sites/default/files/Leadership%20in%20Nuclear%20Energy%20Markets.pdf

As an active participant in commercial markets, the United States has considerable leverage internationally 
AND
jurisdiction over commercial nuclear trade, global safety and security, and nonproliferation. 

Plan key to a robust manufacturing sector in the US that spreads the model around the world
Rosner and Goldberg ‘11
Robert, Stephen, University of Chicago, Energy Policy Institute, Small Modular Reactors – Key to Future Nuclear Power Generation in the U.S., http://epic.uchicago.edu/sites/epic.uchicago.edu/files/uploads/SMRWhite_Paper_Dec.14.2011copy.pdf

As stated earlier, SMRs have the potential to achieve significant greenhouse gas emission reductions
AND
Japan, Korea, Russia, and, now rapidly emerging, China.
SCENARIO 1: Proliferation
Brink of widespread prolif now
CFR 7-5-2012, “The Global Nuclear Nonproliferation Regime,” Council on Foreign Relations, http://www.cfr.org/proliferation/global-nuclear-nonproliferation-regime/p18984

Nuclear weapons proliferation, whether by state or nonstate actors, poses one of the 
AND
way for &amp;#34;the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons.&amp;#34;

Ensures safe nuclear technology - allows the US to promote non-proliferation objectives, otherwise wildfire prolif is inevitable
Loudermilk 2011
(Micah, research associate with the Energy and Environmental Security Policy program at National Defense University, “Small Nuclear Reactors and US Energy Security: Concepts, Capabilities, and Costs”, Journal of Energy Security, 5-31-11, 
http://www.ensec.org/index.php?view=articleandcatid=116%3Acontent0411andid=314%3Asmall-nuclear-reactors-and-us-energy-security-concepts-capabilities-and-costsandtmpl=componentandprint=1andpage=andoption=com_contentandItemid=375, accessed 8-1-12, RSR)
Reactor safety itself notwithstanding, many argue that the scattering of small reactors around the 
AND
standards on nuclear agreements, spent fuel reprocessing, and developing reactor technologies.

Proliferations causes extinction – nuclear arms races and miscalculated nuclear war
Utgoff 2’
Utgoff, 2002 (Deputy Director of the Strategy Forces, and Resources Division of the Institute for Defense Analyses, Victor, “Proliferation, Missile Defence, and American Ambitions,” Survival, Volume 44, Number 2, Summer)
First, the dynamics of getting to a highly proliferated world could be very dangerous
AND
a hill to bury the bodies of dead cities or even whole nations.

SCENARIO 2: Tech Leadership
Global warming is happening; 5 reasons
NWF 12 (July 2012, National Wildlife Federation, http://www.nwf.org/Global-Warming/What-is-Global-Warming/Global-Warming-is-Happening-Now.aspx) JD
No longer is global warming something only facing future generations. Changes to our climate 
AND
 as low-lying areas are inundated with saltwater.
It’s anthropogenic and scientific consensus goes aff.
Lewandowsky and Ashley 2011 (Stephan Lewandowsky, Professor of Cognitive Studies at the University of Western Australia, and Michael Ashley, Professor of Astrophysics at the University of New South Wales, June 24, 2011, “The false, the confused and the mendacious: how the media gets it wrong on climate change,” http://goo.gl/u3nOC)
But despite these complexities, some aspects of climate science are thoroughly settled. We

SMRs key to spurring the development of nuclear technology – increases the competitive edge.
Fleischmann, ‘11
(Chuck, Representative from the 3rd District in Tennessee, “Small Modular Reactors Could Help With U.S. Energy Needs”, American Physical Society, Vol. 6, No. 2, October 2011, http://www.aps.org/publications/capitolhillquarterly/201110/backpage.cfm, accessed 8-1-12, RSR)
The timely implementation of small reactors could position the United States on the cutting edge 
AND
strategic position on the forefront of expanding global technologies in the nuclear arena. 
Next 5 years key to avoid a tipping point – gets modeled internationally
Strobe Talbott, President of the Brookings Institution, and John-Michael Arnold, special assistant to the President at Brookings, 5-25-2012, “It’s the Climate, Stupid!” Brookings,http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2012/5/25%20americas%20role%20talbott/0525%20americas%20role%20talbott.pdf

On both economic and security policy, the United States is suffering from an acute 
AND
a window of opportunity or a window of obligation, it is closing.

Nuclear tech solves warming – decreases reliance on carbon based sources.
WNA 7 (World Nuclear Association, Nuclear Energy: Meeting the Climate Change Challenge¶ , IPCC, 4th Assessment Report, Mitigation of Climate Change (2007), http://www.world-nuclear.org/climatechange/nuclear_meetingthe_climatechange_challenge.html)
Over the next twenty five years global electricity demand is expected to double. By 
AND
supply process heat, enabling industry to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels.
Warming causes extinction
Tickell, ‘8 
(Oliver, Climate Researcher, The Gaurdian, “On a planet 4C hotter, all we can prepare for is extinction”, 8-11, http://www.guardian.co.uk/ commentisfree/2008/aug/11/ climatechange)
We need to get prepared for four degrees of global warming, Bob Watson told 
AND
warming caused by human emissions could propel us towards a similar hothouse Earth.

Solvency
Nuclear industry is constricting – no new reactors coming online
Pete Domenici and Warren F. “Pete” Miller, part time Research Professor at Texas A and M University and former assistant secretary for nuclear energy at the U.S. Department of Energy, July 2012, “Maintaining U.S. Leadership in Global Nuclear Energy Markets,” Bipartisan Policy Center,http://bipartisanpolicy.org/sites/default/files/Leadership%20in%20Nuclear%20Energy%20Markets.pdf

Prospects for new reactor construction in the United States have constricted significantly in recent years
AND
construction very difficult for at least the next decade, if not longer.
Incentives now takes out their disads
WNN 12 (World Nuclear News, SMR vendors apply for government funds, May 22 2012, 
http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN-SMR_vendors_apply_for_government_funds-2205124.html) 
The DoE announced in March 2012 that a total of $450 million would be

Global fusion is possible and inevitable – but will be too slow without the US. Absent increased support, the reduction in federal spending for fusion will cede our tech leadership to other countries
Stewart Prager, 5/12/2011, &amp;#34;Perspective on: The future of fusion,&amp;#34; (Prager is the director of the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, a Department of Energy national laboratory, and a professor of astrophysical sciences at Princeton), (Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, Interview by Kitta MacPherson), http://www.pppl.gov/news/2011/05/pppl-great-story-bright-future

Why should the U.S. maintain its funding of the fusion program?¶

world stage in fusion and consign us to third world status in fusion.

That collapses hegemony – tech leadership is the biggest internal link

Otherwise hegemony will remain sustainable

what the world looked like right before the American order came into being. 

And U.S. leadership shapes global norms of fusion adoption — stops weaponization

Fusion is possible – scientific breakthroughs prove it is feasible, but federal support is vital for commercialization – development of fusion solve all global problems

DEBATE about America’s energy supply is heating up: gas prices are rising, ethanol 
AND
that will shape our future. Scientists and engineers stand ready to help.



1AC Workforce Advantage
Fusion is feasible, but funding cuts devastate prospects for commercialization – specifically, loss of funding to MIT crushes our scientific leadership. 
Nick Cunningham and Andrew Holland, 8/3/12, AOL Energy, &amp;#34;through innovation and investment, the US can lead in next-generation energy, nuclear fusion,&amp;#34; (Andrew Holland is a Senior Fellow and Nicholas Cunningham is a Policy Analyst for Energy and Climate at the American Security Project, a non-partisan think tank devoted to studying questions of America&amp;#39;s long-term national security.) http://energy.aol.com/2012/08/03/through-innovation-and-investment-the-u-s-can-lead-in-next-gen/

One striking example is the proposed budget cuts for fusion energy. Research in fusion 
AND

The Administration also believes that U.S.-China SandT cooperation has played a consistent stabilizing role in U.S.-China relations. While the overall U.S.-China relationship may swing up or down as a result of political and economic developments, changes in leadership and other factors, the U.S.-China SandT relationship has remained a largely stable pillar of the bilateral relationship, allowing a continuance of cooperative activities in science and technology at levels determined more by scientific accomplishment, interest and available budget than by geopolitical interest.
