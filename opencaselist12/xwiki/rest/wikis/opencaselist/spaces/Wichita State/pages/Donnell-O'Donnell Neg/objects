Treating nature as a standing reserve ontologically conditions the way in which it reveals it self to us. Viewing the world always creates blindspots which makes ecological collapse and nuclear war inevitable.

Thus the alt: the judge should vote negative to do nothing in reaction to the call of the affirmative. 
Doing nothing de-activates managerial thinking by removing a clear pragmatic end for thought – this re-thinking of thinking produces a more reflective relationship to the earth that allows it to disclose itself based upon everyday materiality

The term “nuke” is preferable to “nuclear” because it deconstructs the nuclearist impulses surrounding the term.
