Plan: The United States Federal Government should substantially increase market-fixed production cost incentives for domestic deployment of small modular nuclear reactors. 

Renaissance Adv
US nuclear renaissance inevitable- only way to meet demand and government subsidies
Worthington 2012 (David Worthington, February 9, 2012, The U.S. nuclear renaissance has begun  , Smart Planet, http://www.smartplanet.com/blog/intelligent-energy/the-us-nuclear-renaissance-has-begun/13058) JD
There are cooling towers on the horizon in the United States. The nuclear renaissance 
AND
million homes at a cost of US$14 billion, CNN reported.

Global cooperation has restored public faith in nuclear energy; Fukushima doesn’t matter
WNA 11 (World Nuclear Association, The Nuclear Renaissance  , August 2011, http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf104.html) JD
The 1986 Chernobyl disaster marked the nadir of public support for nuclear power. However
AND
been any harm or hazard to anyone on account of those from nuclear power

Scenario 1: Meltdowns 
Old reactor types make meltdowns inevitable – reactors have shut down in the past and the NRC has failed at regulation
Gronlund 2007 (Nuclear power in a Warming world: Assessing the Risks, Addressing the Challenges, Lisbeth Gronlund;  David Lochbaum;  Edwin Lyman, Union of Concerned Scientists, http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/nuclear_power/nuclear-power-in-a-warming-world.pdf) JD
Safety problems remain despite a lack of  serious accidents.   A serious nuclear power accident 
AND
problems so extensive that a year or more is   needed to fix them.

SMRs solve
Wheeler 10 (November 22, 2010, “Small Modular Reactors May Offer Significant Safety and Security Enhancements”, John Wheeler, Clear Trend, http://thisweekinnuclear.com/?p=1193) JD
Even better, most SMRs are small enough that they cannot over heat and melt 
AND
and lower operating costs (a smaller footprint means a smaller security force). 

Meltdowns cause extinction

Reuters said the 1995 Kobe quake caused $100 billion in damage, up to

entire region. &amp;#34;It could be, literally, an apocalyptic event.

Scenario 2: Nuclear Terrorism Scenario
Old reactor types make nuke terror inevitable- They’ll steal fissile material
Early, et al., 2009

The presence and size of a civilian nuclear infrastructure affect terrorist groups’ cost-benefit 
AND
often look for NR materials in the country that they wish to attack.

Terrorists can also use aircrafts and truck bombs to trigger a meltdown.

Existing nuclear power plants were designed to withstand natural disasters, such as earthquakes, 
AND
term deaths and as many as 518,000 long-term deaths.

SMRs solve - they’re buried underground, heavily layered and no on-site refueling

As to the small reactors themselves, the designs achieve a degree of proliferation-

reactors are mitigated and concerns over the widespread distribution of nuclear fuel allayed.

Nuclear terrorism causes retaliation that sparks global nuclear war and extinction.

As an active participant in commercial markets, the United States has considerable leverage internationally

jurisdiction over commercial nuclear trade, global safety and security, and nonproliferation.

Reactor safety itself notwithstanding, many argue that the scattering of small reactors around the

Proliferations causes extinction – nuclear arms races and miscalculated nuclear war
Utgoff 2’
Utgoff, 2002 (Deputy Director of the Strategy Forces, and Resources Division of the Institute for Defense Analyses, Victor, “Proliferation, Missile Defence, and American Ambitions,” Survival, Volume 44, Number 2, Summer)
First, the dynamics of getting to a highly proliferated world could be very dangerous

We need to get prepared for four degrees of global warming, Bob Watson told 
AND
warming caused by human emissions could propel us towards a similar hothouse Earth.

Solvency
Nuclear industry is constricting – no new reactors coming online
Pete Domenici and Warren F. “Pete” Miller, part time Research Professor at Texas A and M University and former assistant secretary for nuclear energy at the U.S. Department of Energy, July 2012, “Maintaining U.S. Leadership in Global Nuclear Energy Markets,” Bipartisan Policy Center,http://bipartisanpolicy.org/sites/default/files/Leadership%20in%20Nuclear%20Energy%20Markets.pdf

Prospects for new reactor construction in the United States have constricted significantly in recent years
