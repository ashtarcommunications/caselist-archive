&#xD;
Confronting global warming is key to creating new systems of ethical evaluations; means we turn there ethics arguments. Our current system focuses on blame being placed entirely on a single person or small groups of persons; however, in confronting warming we shift to a system in which we all become conscious of the small influences  we have on larger systems of destruction and exploitation. That collapses our current ethical paradigm and opens us up to recognizing other invisible forms of oppression we allow to exist; also means there ethics arguments don’t link.&#xD;
