(Small Nuclear Reactors For Military Installations: Capabilities, Costs, Technological Implications. Richard B. Andres Is A Professor National Security Strategy AT The National War College.  Hanna L. Breetz Is A Doctoral Candidate In The Department Of Political Science At M.I.T. February 2011)
Operational Vulnerability. Operational energy use represents a second serious vulnerability for the U.

Nevertheless, attempts to solve the current energy use problem with efficiency measures and renewable

make the Corps significantly lighter and more mobile by reducing its logistics tail.

Elwell, 2011:
(Andrew Elwell. Journalist Specializing In Defense Industry News/ Data. Renewable Energy Tech Sought For Forward Operating Bases. 12/01/2011.)
&amp;#34;Military operations are a fairly energy-intense undertaking, and energy security is

the desire, nay necessity, to reduce dependence on fossil fuel intensifies.

====Forward Presence Is Key To Preventing Escalation and Deterring Multiple Ongoing Conflict Scenarios; China, North Korea, And Iran.====

Deterring regional aggression with forward basing has been central to U.S. military

~~[George, PhD, Chief Executive Officer and founder of STRATFOR, &amp;#34;The Limitations and Necessity of Naval Power,&amp;#34; April 10, http://www.stratfor.com/limitations_and_necessity_naval_power~~]

====Any Of These Conflict Scenarios Could Go Nuclear====
Kearns, 2011:

First, there has been a major reduction in the global nuclear

=Advantage 2: Nuclear Leadership=

====Status quo barriers will block SMR adoption in the private sector. Only the plan solves, Leading To Global SMR Spillover Through Strong U.S. Nuclear Energy Leadership ====

Perhaps most importantly, investing in nuclear energy will position America to lead in a

There are limits, however, to what this approach can accomplish. 
AND
we may soon see a future that neither the proponents of nuclear abolition, nor their critics, would ever want.

====Absent The Plan, China Will Rely On Outdated Nuclear Technology, Spurring Multiple Meltdowns And Nuclear Disasters====
Decker, 2011:
(Decker: The Next Nuclear Meltdown: China.  Brett M. Decker. Journalist For The Washington Times. March 16, 2011.)
The Middle Kingdom is earthquake-prone and suffers regular damage from major tremors. 
AND
relentless urgency for substantial, sustained economic growth is a ticking time bomb.

**====A Nuclear Meltdown Would Be Catastrophic, poisoning half the planet and killing millions====**

In fact, that disaster  ~~[Chernobyl~~] killed nearly one million people worldwide from nuclear radiation exposure. 
AND
Potentially, millions of lives will be jeopardized.

The Rabid Tiger Project believes that a nuclear war is most likely to start in 
AND
an ocean of troubled waters, and some people love to go fishing.

====Small Reactors Are Key To Solving Water Scarcity  ====
Science Daily, 2007:
**ScienceDaily 07.  ScienceDaily, Could Nuclear Power Be the Answer to Fresh Water?, November 20, 2007, http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/11/071120082429.htm-http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/11/071120082429.htm **
Jain emphasizes that a sustainable, non-polluting solution to water shortages is essential. Renewable energy sources, such as wind, solar, and wave power, may be used in conjunction to generate electricity and to carry out desalination, which could have a significant impact on reducing potential increased greenhouse gas emissions. &amp;#34;Nuclear energy seawater desalination has a tremendous potential for the production of freshwater,&amp;#34; Jain adds.
The development of a floating nuclear plant is one of the more surprising solutions to 
AND
attachment to FNPPs helping the reactor to desalinate seawater,&amp;#34; Verma points out.

====DoD Adoption Of Small Reactors De-Escalates Flashpoint Of Water Conflict By Providing Water At Key Sites====
Pfeffer and Macon, 2001:

The idea of using nuclear power to produce synthetic fuels, originally proposed in 1963

====Dirty Water Is The Biggest Impact, Killing More Than War And All Other Violence ====

More people die from unsafe water than from all forms of violence, including war
AND
become scarce and would be even scarcer as a result of climate change.

====Space militarization is already happening. A global scramble for dominance is the most dangerous scenario, leading to global war and making conflict escalation inevitable.====&#xD;
**Morini, 2012:**&#xD;
(Daryl Morini. Ph.D Candidate At The University Of Queensland. The Coming U.S.-China Space Race. August 15, 2012.) &#xD;
China and the U.S. are also assuming increasingly competitive stances on the &#xD;
