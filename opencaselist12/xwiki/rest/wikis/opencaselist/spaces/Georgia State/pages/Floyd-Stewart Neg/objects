Russia, without the massive cash flow provided by its oil and natural-gas reserves, would be forced to rely for its continued economic existence on the far skinnier profits generated by other raw-material exports and its none-too-competitive factories.

==Governmentality K==&#xD;
&#xD;

====The alternative is to approach the truth claims of the affirmative with a critical attitude that analyzes governmentality and aims at de-subjectification. This is the only way to engage questions of change without sacrificing ethics and being constrained by destructive or intolerable ideas and standards of judgment. ====&#xD;
**Hamann 09** ~~[Trent H. Hamann is an Assistant Professor of Philosophy at St. John~’s University. &amp;#34;Neoliberalism, governmentality, and ethics,&amp;#34; Foucault Studies, No 6~~]&#xD;
Tying all of these modes of resistance together is the question &amp;#34;Who are we&#xD;
AND&#xD;
asking it. In his introduction to The Politics of Truth he writes:&#xD;
The ~’we~’ always comes after, emerging only through the on-going light its activities shed on the habits and practices through which people come to govern themselves—and so see themselves and one another. Indeed in this lies precisely the originality of the critical attitude, its singular sort of universality, its distinctive relation to ~’today~’—to ~’now~’, ~’the present~’, l~’actuel.37&#xD;
This &amp;#34;critical attitude&amp;#34; that Foucault repeatedly refers to in all of his discussions &#xD;
AND&#xD;
it in his book Foucault~’s Askesis: An Introduction to the Philosophical Life, &#xD;
Power functions by investing, defining, and caring for the body understood as a bioeconomic entity. The operation of biopower is to define the freedom and truth of the individual in economic and biological terms. Reason is given the task of comprehending the body in these terms and setting the conditions within which it can be free. ...The formation of the disciplines marks the moment where askesis itself was absorbed within biopolitics.&#xD;
Foucault explicitly identified critique, not as a transcendental form of judgment that would subsume &#xD;
AND&#xD;
be a work of art, but not a life. O~’Leary writes:&#xD;
Foucault is less interested in the critical power of art, than in the ~’artistic~’ or ~’plas-tic~’ power of critique. For Foucault, not only do no special advantages accrue from the autonomy of the aesthetic, but this autonomy unnecessarily restricts our possibilities for self-constitution. Hence, not only is Foucault aware of the specific nature of aesthetics after Kant, he is obviously hostile to it.41&#xD;
What O~’Leary rightly identifies here is Foucault~’s interest in an aesthetics of existence that specifically &#xD;
AND&#xD;
locations, from the international anti-globalization movement to local community organizing.&#xD;

The prospect that new sources of supply in the Americas could lead to years of flat or even falling oil prices is a source of great concern in the Kremlin. Surging oil revenues over his 12 years in power have helped President Vladimir Putin pay for an eightfold increase in government spending, going to everything from pension and wage hikes to costly projects like the Sochi Olympics to a major military buildup.
