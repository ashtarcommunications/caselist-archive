&#xD;
The United States federal government should substantially increase financial incentives for the conversion of domestic weapons production to domestic distributed solar and wind power production in the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
Contention One – the Military Industrial Complex&#xD;
&#xD;
Mass subsidization of defense contracting blocks sustainable energy from coming online.  This breeds economic dependence on war while funneling industrial development into unending military accumulation.&#xD;
Feldman 7 (Jonathan, associate professor of economic history at Stockholm University, “From Warfare State to &amp;#34;Shadow State&amp;#34;: Militarism, Economic Depletion, and Reconstruction,” Social Text, 25(2), Summer)&#xD;
Lying behind the…for soldiers’ pay.&#xD;
&#xD;
Ever increasing defense contracts are justified by the institutionalization of threat inflation.  Mass military spending has become the norm as new threats build a mutually dependent relationship between the national security state and neoconservative hawks.&#xD;
Scheer 8 (Robert, clinical professor of communications at the University of Southern California&amp;#39;s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, former Vietnam correspondent, managing editor and editor in chief of Ramparts magazine, former national correspondent for the Los Angeles Times 1976-1993), former Poynter Fellow at Yale, and former fellow in arms control at Stanford,  The Pornography of Power: How Defense Hawks Hijacked 9/11 and Weakened America, pp. xi-xvii )&#xD;
I bring it…it became institutionalized.&#xD;
&#xD;
The mere availability of weapons creates a constant preparation for war that is the primary source of global conflict.&#xD;
Hossein-zadeh 6 (Ismael, professor of economics at Drake University, The Political Economy of Militarism, pp. 96-97)&#xD;
Led by the…other nations.&amp;#34;41&#xD;
&#xD;
Weapons manufacturing hypnotizes us into a sense of fear and panic that demands silence to ensure its survival – the products created by this system are the greatest source of terror and violence in recorded history, responsible for more deaths in the past 50 years than the past two thousand combined.&#xD;
Mercieca 4 (Charles, Executive Vice President of the International Association of Educators for World Peace NGO and professor emeritus of History and Philosophy at the Alabama A&amp;#38;M University, “Weapons Industry: Source of Terrorism,” The Revisionist, 2(3), http://www.vho.org/tr/2004/3/Mercieca300-302.html)&#xD;
At this stage…millions of people?&#xD;
&#xD;
Contention Two – Climate Ethics&#xD;
&#xD;
Scientists agree – warming is real and human induced.&#xD;
Trenberth 12 (Kevin, Distinguished Senior Scientist, The Wall Street Journal “Check With Climate Scientists for Views on Climate” February 1, 2012, http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204740904577193270727472662.html) &#xD;
The National Academy…the doctor ordered.&#xD;
&#xD;
Warming guarantees massive species extinction.&#xD;
Pachauri 7 (Nobel Laureate and Chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. 10/10/07. Nobel Prize Acceptance Speech, “Nobel Lecture.” http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2007/ipcc-lecture_en.html)&#xD;
Climate change is…to human society.&#xD;
&#xD;
Mourning the extinction of any creature in the odyssey of evolution enables humans to become co-passengers on the ship where we live and let live and wonder in the magnitude and duration of the biotic community.  &#xD;
Leopold 66 (Aldo, former Prof Univ Madison Wisconsin and credited by many as one of the first environmental ethicists; A Sand County Almanac; pp. 116-117)&#xD;
We have erected…over the beasts.&#xD;
&#xD;
Ethical responsibility means transcendence of anthropocentrism and the domination and denial of nonhuman subjectivity.&#xD;
Davy 7 (Jane Davy; Pres Enviro Studies Assoc Canada; Ethics &amp;#38; the Environment; 12:1; &amp;#34;An Other Face of Ethics in Levinas&amp;#34;   &#xD;
“The Name of…other nonhuman persons.&#xD;
&#xD;
Anthropocentrism causes extinction—it divorces our relationship with the natural world and makes ecocide inevitable.&#xD;
Gottlieb 94 (Roger, Professor of Humanities at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Ph.D. in Philosophy from Brandeis University, “Ethics and Trauma: Levinas, Feminism, and Deep Ecology,” Crosscurrents: A Journal of Religion and Intellectual Life, Summer, http://www.crosscurrents.org/feministecology.htm)&#xD;
Here I will…for us all. &#xD;
&#xD;
Contention Three – Defense Conversion&#xD;
&#xD;
Redirecting defense spending towards solar and wind development eliminates the self-justifying nature of the military industrial complex.&#xD;
Cervinka 12 (Vashek, Program Manager of Design Competition, Author of “Questions We Have Forgotten to Ask,” “Build an energy-industrial complex,” The Davis Enterprise, 3/22, http://www.davisenterprise.com/forum/opinion-columns/build-an-energy-industrial-complex/)&#xD;
The United States….and national security.&#xD;
&#xD;
Incentives for defense conversion to alternative energy contains the power of the military-industrial complex – defense contractors are ready and willing to make the shift if the federal government articulates a clear vision for change.&#xD;
Rifkin 90 (Jeremy, President of the Greenhouse Crisis Foundation, “Turning Arms Into a ‘Green Dividend’,” Washington Post, 4/15, L/N)&#xD;
FOR MOST of…toward this goal.&#xD;
&#xD;
Funding for U.S. military procurement contracts should be reallocated tax incentives for defense conversion to renewable energy.  Federal action is necessary and will set the global agenda toward transitioning to renewable energy.  &#xD;
Partridge 6 (Ernest, consultant, writer and lecturer in the field of Environmental Ethics and Public Policy, taught Philosophy at the University of California, and in Utah, Colorado and Wisconsin, “Swords into Plowshares,” 5/30, http://www.crisispapers.org/essays6p/swords.htm)&#xD;
An analysis of…now a necessity.&#xD;
&#xD;
US action is key – we structure other nations’ defense budgeting decisions.&#xD;
Markusen 3 (Ann, Professor of Urban and Regional Planning and Public Policy and Director, Project on Regional and Industrial Economics, Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs, University of Minnesota “From Defense to Development,” in From Defence to Development: International Perspective on Realizing the Peace Dividend, ed. Ann Markusen, Sean DiGiovanna and Michael Leary, http://www.epsusa.org/publications/newsletter/2003/nov2003/markusen.pdf)&#xD;
The decisions of…civilian product lines.&#xD;
