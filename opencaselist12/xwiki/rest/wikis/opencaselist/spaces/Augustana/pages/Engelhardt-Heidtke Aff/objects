&#xD;
Private sector wants to invest in brownfields but liability laws prevent development&#xD;
&#xD;
Slutzky and Frey, 10 (David, Professor at the University of Virginia, and AJ, professor at Washington and Lee University, “Brownfields Uncertainty: A Proposal To Reform Superfund”, www.huduser.org/periodicals/cityscpe/vol12num3/ch5.pdf)&#xD;
&#xD;
CERCLA imposes extraordinary liability… environmental cleanup and tort liability.&#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;
&#xD;
Current environmental law trades the lives of minorities for profits and political expedience – America is de-facto segregated via the unequal division of environmental harm&#xD;
&#xD;
Bullard 99 (Robert D, Ware Distinguished Professor of Sociology and Director of the Environmental Justice Resource Center at Clark Atlanta University, “Dismantling environmental racism in the USA”, Local Environment, Feb99, Vol. 4, Issue 1, Academic Search Premier)&#xD;
&#xD;
The environmental protection apparatus… colour, national origin or income.  &#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;
&#xD;
Contention Two is Environmental Racism:&#xD;
&#xD;
Abandoned brownfield sites spread across the country as a testament to white America’s flight from the inner city and disdain for its residents. The politics of ‘not in my back yard’ ensure the neglect of brownfields remains a continual source of racial subordination.&#xD;
&#xD;
Bullard et al 8 (Robert D., Director of the Environmental Justice Resource Center at Clark Atlanta University, Paul Mohai, Professor of Natural Resources and Environment, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Robin Saha, an Assistant Professor of Environmental Studies at the University of Montana, and Beverly Wright, Director of the Deep South Center for Environmental Justice at Dillard University, “Toxic Wastes and Race at Twenty: Why Race Still Matters After All These Years,” 38 Environmental Law, 371, Lexis)&#xD;
&#xD;
Despite progress in research, planning, and policy,… 20% higher than the national average.&#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;
&#xD;
The result is that America’s cities are filled with what dominant society views as literally ‘garbage humans,’ individuals worthy of so little regard that they are literally trash to be thrown out of ‘our’ space. The politics of pollution have created two Americas – one with an environment worthy of protection and one whose environment, just like its residents, is consigned to annihilation&#xD;
&#xD;
Mills 1 (Charles W., Professor of Philosophy at the University of Illinois, Chicago, “Faces of Environmental Racism: Confronting Issues of Global Justice (2nd ed.,), p. 84-89)&#xD;
&#xD;
Only with a more realistic sense of this moral… the black trash, of the white body politic.&#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;
&#xD;
The U.S. government’s policies towards urban racial minorities are modeled globally – the structure of U.S. cities is reflected in cities across the globe&#xD;
&#xD;
Goldsmith, 00 (William W. Goldsmith, Professor in the Department of City and Regional Planning at Cornell University, and Director of the Cornell Undergraduate Program in Urban and Regional Studies, 2000, Globalizing Cities: A New Spatial Order?, p. 38-39)&#xD;
&#xD;
In contrast, the reasoning below turns the usual… This is where the argument begins. &#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;
&#xD;
Brownfields have become the ultimate manifestation of a new global division between “life zones” and &amp;#34;death zones,&amp;#34; where the refuse of the body politic is consigned to elimination, culminating in the destruction of entire populations&#xD;
&#xD;
Balibar 4 (Etienne Emeritus Professor of Philosohy at University of Paris-X and Distinguished Professor of Humanities at University of California-Irvine, We, The People of Europe? Reflections on Transnational Citizenship, p. 126-29)&#xD;
&#xD;
I am aware of all these difficulties… equality, the horizon of political action.&#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;
&#xD;
And the primary factor behind the abandonment of brownfields and the inner city as a whole is the expansive liability burdens placed on anyone who dares to redevelop abandoned brownfield sites – the fear of liability for environmental harm ensures that brownfields remain a perpetual source of structural environmental racism&#xD;
&#xD;
Kibel 98 (Paul Stanton, adjunct prof, Golden Gate U School of Law, Boston College Environmental Affairs Law Reviewurl:http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?RQT=318andpmid=20093andTS=1215473748andclientId=10553andVInst=PRODandVName=PQDandVType=PQD, Spring 1998url:http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?RQT=572andVType=PQDandVName=PQDandVInst=PRODandpmid=20093andpcid=836195andSrchMode=3. Vol. 25, Iss. 3)&#xD;
&#xD;
Abandoned, deteriorating property has become… educating and pressuring government agencies. n99url:http://www.lexisnexis.com/us/lnacademic/frame.do?tokenKey=rsh-20.475152.2129267647andtarget=results_DocumentContentandreloadEntirePage=trueandrand=1215885689822andreturnToKey=20_T4148659991andparent=docview#n99&#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;
&#xD;
Finally, environmental justice must become the overriding imperative of our energy policy – systematic environmental racism ensures global environmental collapse and the total destruction of humanity&#xD;
&#xD;
Bryant, 95 (Bunyan Bryant, Professor in the School of Natural Resources and Environment, and an adjunct professor in the Center for Afro-American and African Studies at the University of Michigan, 1995, Environmental Justice: Issues, Policies, and Solutions, p. 209-212)&#xD;
&#xD;
Although the post-World War II economy was designed… production cycle, we should at least have that as a goal&#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;
&#xD;
Contention Three is Democracy:&#xD;
&#xD;
Current solar development focuses on technocratic elites – decentralized generation sparks a transformative democratic process.&#xD;
&#xD;
Hoffman and High-Pippert 5 (Steven M. Hoffman, professor of political science at the University of St. Thomas, and Angela High-Pippert, associate professor of political science at the University of St. Thomas, “Community Energy: A Social Architecture for an Alternative Energy Future” Bulletin of Science Technology Society  25; 387, http:~~/~~/bst.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/25/5/387.pdfurl:http://bst.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/25/5/387.pdf)&#xD;
&#xD;
The evolution of the industrialized world’s electrical… implications and possibilities of the technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;
&#xD;
Decentralized solar production is the vital internal link to participatory democracy – leaving the transition up to the market guarantees we will remain far behind the curve and trapped within an autocratic system of control.&#xD;
&#xD;
Berman and O’Connor 96 (Dan Berman, PhD, journalist, professor, environmental activist, and John T. O&amp;#39;Connor, pre-eminent spokesperson for the environmental movement, Who Owns the Sun? People, Politics, and the Struggle for a Solar Economy. http:~~/~~/www.chelseagreen.com/images/whoownsthesun.pdfurl:http://www.chelseagreen.com/images/whoownsthesun.pdf)&#xD;
&#xD;
Although most citizens have not yet recognized these truths… all of us must have our place in the sun.&#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;
&#xD;
Participatory democracy is the only alternative to war and genocide.&#xD;
&#xD;
Scott and Katz-Fishman 4 (Jerome Scott, Director of Project South: Institute for the Elimination of Poverty and Genocide and Walda Katz-Fishman, board Chair of Project South and prof @ howard univ, 10-26, “Popular Democracy - a vision for our movement” http:~~/~~/www.zmag.org/znet/viewArticle/7600url:http://www.zmag.org/znet/viewArticle/7600)&#xD;
&#xD;
When people talk about &amp;#34;democracy&amp;#34; we immediately… and fighting for. Make it happen!&#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;
&#xD;
Thus the plan: The United States federal government should substantially reduce liability under the Comprehensive Environmental Responses, Compensation and Liability Act for entities that pursue distributed solar energy production on Environmental Protection Agency-designated brownfield sites in the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;
&#xD;
Contention Four is Solvency:&#xD;
&#xD;
Brightfields create urban revitalization – community involvement, environmental justice,  andenergy production are just a few of the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
Renewable Energy Focus 7 “Waste to Watts,” March/April, http:~/~/www.renewableenergyfocus.com/articles/solarpass/features/Waste_to_watts.pdf&#xD;
&#xD;
Many urban areas grapple with the challenge… two or three of these applications.&#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;
&#xD;
Brownfields are a key test market for renewables – they enable a transition that reduces climate change and promotes solar power.&#xD;
&#xD;
Northeast-Midwest Institute 8 Northeast-Midwest Institute, The National Brownfields Coalition, “A&#xD;
&#xD;
Proposal to Establish Pilots for Sustainable Development and Alternative Energy Reuse of Brownfields,” March,&#xD;
&#xD;
http:~/~/www.nemw.org/EstablishPilots4SustainDev-AltEnergy.pdf&#xD;
&#xD;
The third opportunity area is to redevelop… and revenue for the community.14&#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;
&#xD;
Brightfields, or brownfield projects using alternative energy, are key to reversing the cycle of urban abandonment – the plan is key to creating a model that spills over to other urban renewal projects. ONLY Brightfields create environmental justice and sustainability&#xD;
&#xD;
Moskal 3 John, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, April, “Brockton Brightfields: InnovativeGreen Power Marketing Pilot,” http:~/~/www.epa.gov/swerrims~/~/docs/iwg/BrocktonBrightfieldsfinal.pdf&#xD;
&#xD;
Monetizing the environmental benefits… public health benefits for all stakeholders.&#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;
&#xD;
Liability issues make investors wary of assuming risk for contaminated sites, exacerbating brownfield problems&#xD;
&#xD;
Bjelland 2 (Mark D, Assistant prof of Geo., Gustavus Adolphus College, Until justice or stewardship embrace: Or, how a geographer thinks about Brownfield sites, Christian Scholar&amp;#39;s Reviewurl:http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?RQT=318andpmid=52723andTS=1215554028andclientId=10553andVInst=PRODandVName=PQDandVType=PQD.

&#xD;
The proliferation of vacant or abandoned… and also an environmental justice concern.&#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;
&#xD;
A large-scale brightfields initiative is key to make wide-ranging urban revitalization possible – plan is modeled internationally.&#xD;
&#xD;
EPA 99 Environmental Protection Agency, “Energy Department Announces National Initiative to Redevelop Brownfields with Renewable Energy,” http:~/~/www.epa.gov/swerosps/bf/html-doc/brightfd.htm&#xD;
&#xD;
&amp;#34;Incorporating solar and other renewable… reduce greenhouse gas emissions.&#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;
&#xD;
Demands on the State are critical to reconstituting citizenship and resisting racism.&#xD;
&#xD;

This Comment is…of this discussion. &#xD;
&#xD;
2. We meet-reducing liabilities is an INCENTIVE for investors-that’s Slutsky 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
3. C/I reduce means to make smaller- OED 71&#xD;
&#xD;
4. Our definition better-no chance to their abuse because we give them links to their arguments-they get solar bad, state bad and all their other stuff&#xD;
4b. More predictable-we specify our reduction under a specific definition for specific areas-best way to have good education.&#xD;
&#xD;
5. Not a voting issue – reasonability is key since T is all or nothing – competing interpretations creates a race to the bottom and voting on potential abuse makes the judge intervene based on their interpretation of what is abusive.&#xD;

&#xD;
Mass subsidization of defense contracting blocks sustainable energy from coming online.  This breeds economic dependence on war while funneling industrial development into unending military accumulation.&#xD;
 Feldman 7 (Jonathan, associate professor of economic history at Stockholm University, “From Warfare State to &amp;#34;Shadow State&amp;#34;: Militarism, Economic Depletion, and Reconstruction,” Social Text, 25(2), Summer)&#xD;
 Lying behind the…for soldiers’ pay.&#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;
&#xD;
Ever increasing defense contracts are justified by the institutionalization of threat inflation.  Mass military spending has become the norm as new threats build a mutually dependent relationship between the national security state and neoconservative hawks.&#xD;
 Scheer 8 (Robert, clinical professor of communications at the University of Southern California&amp;#39;s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, former Vietnam correspondent, managing editor and editor in chief of Ramparts magazine, former national correspondent for the Los Angeles Times 1976-1993), former Poynter Fellow at Yale, and former fellow in arms control at Stanford,  The Pornography of Power: How Defense Hawks Hijacked 9/11 and Weakened America, pp. xi-xvii )&#xD;
 I bring it…it became institutionalized.&#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;
&#xD;
The mere availability of weapons creates a constant preparation for war that is the primary source of global conflict.&#xD;
 Hossein-zadeh 6 (Ismael, professor of economics at Drake University, The Political Economy of Militarism, pp. 96-97)&#xD;
 Led by the…of other nations.&amp;#34;41&#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;
&#xD;
Weapons manufacturing hypnotizes us into a sense of fear and panic that demands silence to ensure its survival – the products created by this system are the greatest source of terror and violence in recorded history, responsible for more deaths in the past 50 years than the past two thousand combined.&#xD;
 Mercieca 4 (Charles, Executive Vice President of the International Association of Educators for World Peace NGO and professor emeritus of History and Philosophy at the Alabama AandM University, “Weapons Industry: Source of Terrorism,” The Revisionist, 2(3), http://www.vho.org/tr/2004/3/Mercieca300-302.html)&#xD;
 At this stage…millions of people?&#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;
&#xD;
Contention Two – Blackouts&#xD;
&#xD;
Grid vulnerability is high now due to band-aidsolutions that rely on fossil fuels – failure is inevitable, collapsing civilization.  Innovative financing for distributed generation is the only way to reduce the risk of blackouts.&#xD;
 Cooper 12 (John, President of NextWatt Solutions and Ecomergence, “Our Outdated Electrical Grid: An Intolerable Situation,” The Energy Collective, 7/3, http://theenergycollective.com/node/90021)&#xD;
 As outages stretch…and persistent vulnerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;
&#xD;
Blackouts risk hundreds of nuclear meltdowns across the country.&#xD;

 The scariest thing…entire grid system.&#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;
&#xD;
Renewable sources are already facing supply side constraints – Demand will continue to grow as rising consumption faces inadequate availability of fossil fuels.  Now is the key time to create proactive financial incentives for the global transition to renewable alternatives.&#xD;
 General Atlantic 7 (Global growth investors, “Energy and resources,” 11/9,http://www.generalatlantic.com/en/news/article/35)&#xD;
 The economic and…more energy efficient.&#xD;

Distributed generation creates storage solutions that provide stable sources of power capable of overcoming concerns of intermittency.&#xD;
 Behles 12 (Deborah, Associate Professor of Law and Clinical Staff Attorney, Environmental Law and Justice Clinic, Golden Gate University School of Law, “An Integrated Green Urban Electrical Grid,” 36 Wm. and Mary Envtl. L. andPol&amp;#39;y Rev. 671, Spring, L/N)&#xD;
 Distributed energy storage…way for renewables. n103&#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;
&#xD;
Thus the Plan:&#xD;
 The United States federal government should substantially increase financial incentives for the conversion of domestic weapons production to domestic distributed solar and wind power production in the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;
&#xD;
Contention Two – Defense Conversion&#xD;
&#xD;
Redirecting defense spending towards solar and wind development eliminates the self-justifying nature of the military industrial complex.&#xD;
 Cervinka 12 (Vashek, Program Manager of Design Competition, Author of “Questions We Have Forgotten to Ask,” “Build an energy-industrial complex,” The Davis Enterprise, 3/22, http://www.davisenterprise.com/forum/opinion-columns/build-an-energy-industrial-complex/)&#xD;
 TheUnited States…and national security.&#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;
&#xD;
Incentives for defense conversion to alternative energy contains the power of the military-industrial complex – defense contractors are ready and willing to make the shift if the federal government articulates a clear vision for change.&#xD;
 Rifkin 90 (Jeremy, President of the Greenhouse Crisis Foundation, “Turning Arms Into a ‘Green Dividend’,” Washington Post, 4/15, L/N)&#xD;
 FOR MOST of…toward this goal.&#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;
&#xD;
Funding for U.S. military procurement contracts should be reallocated tax incentives for defense conversion to renewable energy.  Federal action is necessary and will set the global agenda toward transitioning to renewable energy.  &#xD;
 Partridge 6 (Ernest, consultant, writer and lecturer in the field of Environmental Ethics and Public Policy, taught Philosophy at the University of California, and in Utah, Colorado and Wisconsin, “Swords into Plowshares,” 5/30,http://www.crisispapers.org/essays6p/swords.htm)&#xD;
 An analysis of…now a necessity.&#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;
&#xD;
US action is key – we structure other nations’ defense budgeting decisions.&#xD;
 Markusen 3 (Ann, Professor of Urban and Regional Planning and Public Policy and Director, Project on Regional and Industrial Economics, Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs, University of Minnesota “From Defense to Development,” in From Defence to Development: International Perspective on Realizing the Peace Dividend, ed. Ann Markusen, Sean DiGiovanna and Michael Leary, http://www.epsusa.org/publications/newsletter/2003/nov2003/markusen.pdf)&#xD;
 The decisions of…civilian product lines.&#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;
&#xD;
Defense conversion offers a political alternative to militarism, fossil fuel dependency and war by creating a utopian form of realism based upon transformation of the permanent war society.&#xD;
 Feldman 7 (Jonathan, associate professor of economic history at Stockholm University, “From Warfare State to &amp;#34;Shadow State&amp;#34;: Militarism, Economic Depletion, and Reconstruction,” Social Text, 25(2), Summer)&#xD;
 The limits to…leading intellectual circles.” 66&#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;
&#xD;
European conversion proves – the plan is a both reorientation of defense hardware and a restructuring of values at the individual, national and international level.&#xD;
 Jelusic 1 (Ljubica, Associate Professor and Head of Defence Studies Department at University of Ljubljana, “Sociocultural aspects of defence restructuring and conversion,” in International restructuring and conversion of the arms industries in the military sector: industrial, regional and sociocultural aspects, Proceedings of the International conversion conference Bremen, April, pp. 391-392)&#xD;
 Despite a lot…restructuring of concepts.&#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;
&#xD;
The transition to defense conversion won’t cause an attack on the US or extinction – however, the permanent war making machine could end all human life.  Its try or die for the affirmative.&#xD;
 Melman 70 (Seymour, professor of industrial engineering at Columbia University, Pentagon Capitalism: The Permanent Economy of War)&#xD;
 If we did…multi-overkill world.&#xD;
&#xD;
Federal incentives for defense conversion key – only way to avoid DoD cooption.&#xD;
Melman 88 (Seymour, professor of industrial engineering at Columbia University, “The Economics of Conversion,” http://multinationalmonitor.org/hyper/issues/1988/02/mm0288_07.html)&#xD;
The primary requirement…in that position.&#xD;
&#xD;
Defense cuts are inevitable now but will only cause slow and uncoordinated conversion within the industry – new threats can quickly reverse the transition – but forming connections in the industry can successfully direct resources towards energy production.&#xD;
Thompson 11/9 (Loren, Forbes Contributor, “Defense Industry Needs to Get Serious About Diversifying,” www.forbes.com/sites/lorenthompson/2012/11/09/defense-industry-needs-to-get-serious-about-diversifying/)&#xD;
The defense industry’s…least for now.&#xD;
&#xD;
Obama’s reelection guarantees renewed push for solar power – incentives for vehicles will increase now.&#xD;
Lienert 11/7 (Anita, Correspondent for Edmund’s Inside Line, “Obama’s Second Term Could Herald Renewed Push for EVs, Hydrogen Fuel-Cell Vehicles,” http://www.insideline.com/car-news/obamas-second-term-could-herald-renewed-push-for-evs-hydrogen-fuel-cell-vehicles.html)&#xD;
As President Obama…in short order.&#xD;
&#xD;
Wind production and incentives will increase before the end of the year – takes out link uniqueness but doesn’t solve the AFF.&#xD;

No link – no evidence that new weapons development is key to maintain heg – Cervika says the US is already way out ahead of competitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
2. Hegemonic decline inevitable – hard power fails to contain asymmetrical threats and erodes the domestic base – incentives are key to create economic transformation that avoids hard landing.&#xD;
Feldman 7 (Jonathan, associate professor of economic history at Stockholm University, “From Warfare State to &amp;#34;Shadow State&amp;#34;: Militarism, Economic Depletion, and Reconstruction,” Social Text, 25(2), Summer)&#xD;
Just as a…third-world nation.&#xD;
&#xD;
3. Case outweighs – Hossein-Zadeh and Merceica say the military industrial complex makes extinction inevitable – maintaining heg through weapons causes backlash to American hegemony by forcing us to intervene in conflicts in a way that breeds regional resentment.&#xD;
&#xD;
4. No impact – the Melman evidence proves high defense spending is not necessary to deter aggressors, that this belief makes extinction inevitable by locking us into proxy wars.&#xD;
&#xD;
5. Turn – threat inflation – the Scheer evidence proves that the collapse of hegemony is a scare tactic used to justify ever increasing defense spending, that there is no real threat and to believe that there is creates a cycle of violence – this outweighs their one-shot impacts because every scenario where we use weapons to protect hegemony makes broader conflict and destruction inevitable. &#xD;

The impact is an example of threat construction-Scheer 8 says that we prepare ourselves for imaginary threats and prop up a system of violence and exclusion. The impact has never happened and never will happen-there is no unique reason that this time is different and it won’t be because it comes from a epistemologically flawed way of looking at the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
2. Their DA is part of the logic that sustains the military industrial complex – political horsetrading in Congress is a means of sustaining massive defense procurement that produces a self-reinforcing system incapable of arresting the drive to war.&#xD;
Jarecki 8 (Eugene, Founder and Executive Director of the Eisenhower Project, The American Way of War: Guided Missiles, Misguided Men, and a Republic in Peril, pp. 216-221)&#xD;
Using a simplified…tilted toward war.&#xD;
&#xD;
3. Political capital not key&#xD;
Dickinson, 09 – professor of political science at Middlebury College and taught previously at Harvard University where he worked under the supervision of presidential scholar Richard Neustadt (5/26/09, Matthew, Presidential Power: A NonPartisan Analysis of Presidential Politics, “Sotomayor, Obama and Presidential Power,” http://blogs.middlebury.edu/presidentialpower/2009/05/26/sotamayor-obama-and-presidential-power/, JMP) &#xD;
As for Sotomayor…through legislative boxscores.&#xD;
&#xD;
4. Case outweighs-Merceica 4 says weapons industry is biggest cause of death in history and Pachuri 7 indicates that warming will cause extinction of all life-these are systemic and inevitable which gives us the best impact calc in the round.&#xD;
&#xD;
5. Discourse of security creates policies and political imaginations shaped by the conscious need to dominate in the search of security.&#xD;
Neocleous 8 (Mark, Professor of the Critique of Political Economy; Head of Department of Politics &amp;#38; History of Brunel University, Critique of Security, pp. 2-3)&#xD;
So if, as…studies’ has emerged.&#xD;
&#xD;
6. Securitization creates a cycle of limitless use of violence, makes war a permanent feature of politics, and alienates us from the world.&#xD;
Burke 7 (“Ontologies of War,” Theory and Event, 10(2))&#xD;
In his Politics…such an injury...39&#xD;
&#xD;
7. Add-On to the AFF and Turn to the DA – defense conversion breaks down the security mindset – that’s the Cervika and Feldman evidence that says transformation away from the fossil fuel based economy forces us to reconceptualize the world without the need for hegemonic control of resources – this is key to providing practical alternatives to the supposed inevitability  of war.&#xD;

Sampson, 11/7 (Paula, writer for AP, http://www.canadianbusiness.com/article/105645--oil-prices-fall-on-ample-supplies-and-sluggish-demand)&#xD;
Traders say the…Europe&amp;#39;s largest economy. &#xD;
&#xD;
2. No specific link that defense conversion significantly reduces oil consumption – other industries like chemicals and transportation outweigh.&#xD;
&#xD;
3. Case outweighs – oil prices fluctuate all the time, making their impact improbable – the systemic impact of weapons production and the ethics of climate change outweigh.&#xD;
&#xD;
4. Turn – relying on high prices to trigger conservation causes massive economic instability and war&#xD;

Links worse to the status quo – speciesist ethical imperatives are at its height when the military industrial complex turns nature into a resource for producing weapons – only a risk that the plan is a step in the right direction since their reorientation of the 1AC doesn’t spill over out of the debate round to influence the defense contractors.&#xD;
&#xD;
2. Turn - Rejecting humanism swings too far – eliminates the ability to treat the other with respect.&#xD;
Norris 94 (Christopher Norris, Professor of the History of Ideas, University of Wales, TRUTH AND THE ETHICS OF CRITICISM, 1994, p.87-8)&#xD;
This is what…ts protean manifestations.&#xD;
&#xD;
3. Perm – Do Both&#xD;
&#xD;
4. Perm – Do plan and the alternative all other instances but the plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
5. Perm – Do plan then the alternative.&#xD;
&#xD;
6. Perm – Do the alternative then the plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
7. Perm solves best—understanding that nature has both intrinsic and instrumental value creates pragmatic conservation.&#xD;
Minteer6 (Ben A., Assistant Professor in the Human Dimensions of Biology Faculty in the School of Life Sciences at Arizona State University. “The Landscape of Reform: Civic Pragmatism and Environmental Thought in America,” p. 3) &#xD;
Although I describe…on the landscape. &#xD;
&#xD;
8. No link – our ethics don’t exclude other species – the 1AC Merceica evidence proves that the status quo – weapons production now uses the air, wind and earth as a resource for unlimited consumption.  Voting affirmative challenges speciesism by forcing us to recognize the other in a way that is different from seeing them as a threat to justify endless military consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
9. Turn – defense conversion is the alternative – extend the Feldman and Jelusic evidence – shifting the defense industry away from weapons production and towards sustainable energy production is a NET DECREASE in human self-intrest – our evidence literally says it’s a form of utopian realism that forces us to think outside the box, changing the hardware used to enact violence while also questioning our own values and thinking – as soon as we stop thinking that war is inevitable and necessary, we can change the way we live our lives, acknowledging that humans are part of the natural world and engaging in practical political struggle to change the operation of the permanent war economy.&#xD;
&#xD;
10. Turn – Intersectionality – &#xD;
&#xD;
A. Focus on human-centeredness undermines the ability to challenge intersectional forms of oppression.&#xD;
Cuomo 94 (Christine J., Philosophy Professor, University of Cincinnati, ECOLOGICAL FEMINISM, p. http://www.dhushara.com/book/renewal/voices2/deep.htm)&#xD;
Although Arne Naess…the nonhumanrealm.&#xD;
&#xD;
B. Net-benefit to the perm and add-on for the AFF - The US military industrial complex produces an armaments culture linked to white supremacy, heterosexism and hegemonic masculinity making violence an everyday practice of real life.&#xD;
Campbell 3 (Horace, Professor of African American Studies and Political Science at Syracuse University, “Beyond Militarism and Terrorism in the Biotech Century: Toward a Culture of Peace and Transformation,” Radical History Review, Issue 85, Winter)&#xD;
The United States…launching of war.&#xD;
&#xD;

We meet- the plan gives positive incentives to defense industries for production of distributed solar and renewable energies.  That’s our Cervinka, Rifkin and Partridge evidence from the 1ac.&#xD;
&#xD;
2. Counter- interpretation: incentives include negative actions, carrots and sticks. Incentives can be direct or indirect actions that affect behavior and induce action or enable an environment for production.   &#xD;
ICEM 3 (International Centre for Environmental Management, “Lessons From Global Experience”, Chapter 4, http://www.mekong-protected-areas.org/mekong/docs/tlp-04.pdf)&#xD;
There are several…education and technology. &#xD;
&#xD;
We meet the counter interpretation- we give defense industries a carrot via incentives, and a stick by shifting funding from existing contracts.  This affects the behavior of defense industries because they would be more likely to accept incentives if defense cuts are coming.  The shift of funding enables an environment where defense industries increase production of solar and wind power.&#xD;
&#xD;
3. Counter-interpretation is best-&#xD;
a) Aff innovation- topic and debate in general are negatively biased.  Broad interpretations are good because they give the affirmative more ground which evens the playing field.&#xD;
&#xD;
b) Education- broad interpretations lead to in depth debates over the different types of incentives.  Increases neg PIC ground since most affirmative’s won’t specify their incentive.&#xD;
&#xD;
c) Disad ground- they have no right to fiscal discipline and spending links.  We guarantee them links to DoD tradeoff Das.&#xD;
&#xD;
d) Real world- government agencies use broad definitions of incentive- &#xD;
&#xD;
Environmental Protection Agency proves.  &#xD;
OPEI 1 (Office of Policy, Economics, and Innovation @ EPA, “The United States Experience with Economic Incentives for Protecting the Environment”; EPA-240-R-01-001; January; http://yosemite.epa.gov/ee/epa/eerm.nsf/vwAN/EE-0216B-13.pdf/$file/EE-0216B-13.pdf)&#xD;
For the purposes…the regulatory requirements. &#xD;
&#xD;
4. Their interpretation is bad:&#xD;
a) Distorts literature base- lots of solvency advocates say we should use both positive and negative incentives.  &#xD;
&#xD;
b) Division of ground- they would just counterplan to do negative incentives- proves research on negative incentives is inevitable and predictable.&#xD;
&#xD;
c) Narrow definitions bad- Federal and private sector agrees.&#xD;
COPAFS 93 (The Council of Professional Associations on Federal Statistics; “Providing incentives to survey respondents”; September 22; http://www.copafs.org/reports/providing_incentives_to_survey_respondents.aspx)&#xD;
The Symposium on…incentives already used.&#xD;
&#xD;
5. Counter-interpretation – Restrictions –&#xD;
&#xD;
We meet- increasing incentives for conversion from weapons to solar and wind power is a removal of restrictions on defense industries to make weapons.  Weapons contracts limit defense industries to making weapons.  They become dependent on defense contracts and have no other options for capital.  Defense contracts control industries production.  That’s Feldman from the 1ac.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
The United States federal government should substantially increase financial incentives for the production of solar and wind power in the United States by converted domestic defense contractors.&#xD;
&#xD;
Contention One – the Military Industrial Complex&#xD;
&#xD;
Mass subsidization of defense contracting blocks sustainable energy from coming online.  This breeds economic dependence on war while funneling industrial development into unending military accumulation.&#xD;
Feldman 7 (Jonathan, associate professor of economic history at Stockholm University, “From Warfare State to &amp;#34;Shadow State&amp;#34;: Militarism, Economic Depletion, and Reconstruction,” Social Text, 25(2), Summer)&#xD;
Lying behind the…for soldiers’ pay.&#xD;
&#xD;
Ever increasing defense contracts are justified by the institutionalization of threat inflation.  Mass military spending has become the norm as new threats build a mutually dependent relationship between the national security state and neoconservative hawks.&#xD;
Scheer 8 (Robert, clinical professor of communications at the University of Southern California&amp;#39;s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, former Vietnam correspondent, managing editor and editor in chief of Ramparts magazine, former national correspondent for the Los Angeles Times 1976-1993), former Poynter Fellow at Yale, and former fellow in arms control at Stanford,  The Pornography of Power: How Defense Hawks Hijacked 9/11 and Weakened America, pp. xi-xvii )&#xD;
I bring it…it became institutionalized.&#xD;
&#xD;
The mere availability of weapons creates a constant preparation for war that is the primary source of global conflict.&#xD;
Hossein-zadeh 6 (Ismael, professor of economics at Drake University, The Political Economy of Militarism, pp. 96-97)&#xD;
Led by the…other nations.&amp;#34;41&#xD;
&#xD;
Weapons manufacturing hypnotizes us into a sense of fear and panic that demands silence to ensure its survival – the products created by this system are the greatest source of terror and violence in recorded history, responsible for more deaths in the past 50 years than the past two thousand combined.&#xD;
Mercieca 4 (Charles, Executive Vice President of the International Association of Educators for World Peace NGO and professor emeritus of History and Philosophy at the Alabama A&amp;#38;M University, “Weapons Industry: Source of Terrorism,” The Revisionist, 2(3), http://www.vho.org/tr/2004/3/Mercieca300-302.html)&#xD;
At this stage…millions of people?&#xD;
&#xD;
Contention Two – Climate Ethics&#xD;
&#xD;
Scientists agree – warming is real and human induced.&#xD;
Trenberth 12 (Kevin, Distinguished Senior Scientist, The Wall Street Journal “Check With Climate Scientists for Views on Climate” February 1, 2012, http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204740904577193270727472662.html) &#xD;
The National Academy…the doctor ordered.&#xD;
&#xD;
Positive feedbacks will only accelerate warming, creating major flows of environmental refugees.  &#xD;
Garvey 8 (James, Secretary Royal InstitPhilosophy,The Ethics of Climate Change)&#xD;
The average sea…them in due course. &#xD;
&#xD;
Warming induced sea level rise will leave the world’s poorest groups adversely affected with no means of adaptation.&#xD;
Garvey 8 (James, Secretary Royal Instit Philosophy, The Ethics of Climate Change)&#xD;
Now consider anticipated…by climate change.23 &#xD;
&#xD;
Warming also guarantees massive species extinction.&#xD;
Pachauri 7 (Nobel Laureate and Chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. 10/10/07. Nobel Prize Acceptance Speech, “Nobel Lecture.” http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2007/ipcc-lecture_en.html)&#xD;
Climate change is…to human society.&#xD;
&#xD;
Mourning the extinction of any creature in the odyssey of evolution enables humans to become co-passengers on the ship where we live and let live and wonder in the magnitude and duration of the biotic community.  &#xD;
Leopold 66 (Aldo, former Prof Univ Madison Wisconsin and credited by many as one of the first environmental ethicists; A Sand County Almanac; pp. 116-117)&#xD;

Here I will…for us all.&#xD;
&#xD;
We are ethically obligated to act even in the face of consequentialist or utilitarian demands – our action can’t be contingent on the actions of others but rather should serve as the starting point for setting an example for others to follow. &#xD;
Garvey 8 (James, Secretary Royal Instit Philosophy, The Ethics of Climate Change, pp. 108-110)&#xD;
One of the…be given up.&#xD;
&#xD;
You should take a geologic sense of time – our ecological footprint last for hundreds of years while the planet&amp;#39;s regulatory system works at glacial speeds.  Acting now is critical to slowing the rate of climate change and giving the planet a chance for adaptation – delays magnify the impact.  Doing nothing is not an option.  &#xD;
Garvey 8 (James, Secretary Royal Instit Philosophy, The Ethics of Climate Change, pp. 111-112)&#xD;
Against the arguments…could possibly be.&#xD;
&#xD;
Contention Three  – Defense Conversion&#xD;
&#xD;
Redirecting defense spending towards solar and wind development eliminates the self-justifying nature of the military industrial complex.&#xD;
Cervinka 12 (Vashek, Program Manager of Design Competition, Author of “Questions We Have Forgotten to Ask,” “Build an energy-industrial complex,” The Davis Enterprise, 3/22, http://www.davisenterprise.com/forum/opinion-columns/build-an-energy-industrial-complex/)&#xD;
The United States…and national security.&#xD;
&#xD;
Incentives for defense conversion to alternative energy contains the power of the military-industrial complex – defense contractors are ready and willing to make the shift if the federal government articulates a clear vision for change.&#xD;
Rifkin 90 (Jeremy, President of the Greenhouse Crisis Foundation, “Turning Arms Into a ‘Green Dividend’,” Washington Post, 4/15, L/N)&#xD;
FOR MOST of…toward this goal.&#xD;
&#xD;
Funding for U.S. military procurement contracts should be reallocated tax incentives for defense conversion to renewable energy.  Federal action is necessary and will set the global agenda toward transitioning to renewable energy.  &#xD;
Partridge 6 (Ernest, consultant, writer and lecturer in the field of Environmental Ethics and Public Policy, taught Philosophy at the University of California, and in Utah, Colorado and Wisconsin, “Swords into Plowshares,” 5/30, http://www.crisispapers.org/essays6p/swords.htm)&#xD;
An analysis of…now a necessity.&#xD;

Defense conversion is the key response to climate change – incentives will work to prevent job loss and smooth the transition.&#xD;

Climate change shoulder-shrugging…on high incomes.&#xD;

US action is key – we structure other nations’ defense budgeting decisions.&#xD;
