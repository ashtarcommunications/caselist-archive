&#xD;
Private sector wants to invest in brownfields but liability laws prevent development&#xD;
 Slutzky and Frey, 10 (David, Professor at the University of Virginia, and AJ, professor at Washington and Lee University, “Brownfields Uncertainty: A Proposal To Reform Superfund”, www.huduser.org/periodicals/cityscpe/vol12num3/ch5.pdf)\\&#xD;
&#xD;
CERCLA imposes extraordinary…cleanup and tort liability.&#xD;
&#xD;
Brightfields projects have been successful but are crippled by lack of finances &#xD;
 Northeast-Midwest Institute 8 [The National Brownfields Coalition, “A Proposal to Establish Pilots for &#xD;
 Sustainable Development and Alternative Energy Reuse of Brownfields,” March,[[http:~~/~~/www.nemw.org/EstablishPilots4SustainDev-AltEnergy.pdf&amp;#62;&amp;#62;url:http://www.nemw.org/EstablishPilots4SustainDev-AltEnergy.pdf]]]&#xD;
 While a number…substantial energy benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;
&#xD;
Current environmental law trades the lives of minorities for profits and political expedience – America is de-facto segregated via the unequal division of environmental harm &#xD;
 Bullard 99 (Robert D, Ware Distinguished Professor of Sociology and Director of the Environmental Justice Resource Center at Clark Atlanta University, “Dismantling environmental racism in the USA”, Local Environment, Feb99, Vol. 4, Issue 1, Academic Search Premier)&#xD;
 The environmental protection…origin or income.  &#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;
&#xD;
Contention Two is Environmental Racism:\\&#xD;
&#xD;
Abandoned brownfield sites spread across the country as a testament to white America’s flight from the inner city and disdain for its residents. The politics of ‘not in my back yard’ ensure the neglect of brownfields remains a continual source of racial subordination. &#xD;
 Bullard et al 8(Robert D., Director of the Environmental Justice Resource Center at Clark Atlanta University, Paul Mohai, Professor of Natural Resources and Environment, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Robin Saha, an Assistant Professor of Environmental Studies at the University of Montana, and Beverly Wright, Director of the Deep South Center for Environmental Justice at Dillard University, “Toxic Wastes and Race at Twenty: Why Race Still Matters After All These Years,” 38 Environmental Law, 371, Lexis)&#xD;
 Despite progress in…the national average.&#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;
&#xD;
The result is that America’s cities are filled with what dominant society views as literally ‘garbage humans,’ individuals worthy of so little regard that they are literally trash to be thrown out of ‘our’ space. The politics of pollution have created two Americas – one with an environment worthy of protection and one whose environment, just like its residents, is consigned to annihilation&#xD;
 Mills 1 (Charles W., Professor of Philosophy at the University of Illinois, Chicago, “Faces of Environmental Racism: Confronting Issues of Global Justice (2nd ed.,), p. 84-89)&#xD;
 Only with a…white body politic.&#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;
&#xD;
The U.S. government’s policies towards urban racial minorities are modeled globally – the structure of U.S. cities is reflected in cities across the globe &#xD;
 Goldsmith, 00 (William W. Goldsmith, Professor in the Department of City and Regional Planning at Cornell University, and Director of the Cornell Undergraduate Program in Urban and Regional Studies, 2000, Globalizing Cities: A New Spatial Order?, p. 38-39)&#xD;
 In contrast, the…the argument begins.  &#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;
&#xD;
Brownfields have become the ultimate manifestation of a new global division between “life zones” and &amp;#34;death zones,&amp;#34; where the refuse of the body politic is consigned to elimination, culminating in the destruction of entire populations &#xD;
 Balibar 4(Etienne Emeritus Professor of Philosohy at University of Paris-X and Distinguished Professor of Humanities at University of California-Irvine, We, The People of Europe? Reflections on Transnational Citizenship, p. 126-29)&#xD;
 I am aware…of political action.&#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;
&#xD;
And the primary factor behind the abandonment of brownfields and the inner city as a whole is the expansive liability burdens placed on anyone who dares to redevelop abandoned brownfield sites – the fear of liability for environmental harm ensures that brownfields remain a perpetual source of structural environmental racism&#xD;
 Kibel 98 (Paul Stanton, adjunct prof, Golden Gate U School of Law, Boston College Environmental Affairs Law Review, Spring 1998. Vol. 25, Iss. 3)&#xD;
 Abandoned, deteriorating property…pressuring government agencies. n99&#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;
&#xD;
Finally, environmental justice must become the overriding imperative of our energy policy – systematic environmental racism ensures global environmental collapse and the total destruction of humanity &#xD;
 Bryant, 95 (Bunyan Bryant, Professor in the School of Natural Resources and Environment, and an adjunct professor in the Center for Afro-American and African Studies at the University of Michigan, 1995, Environmental Justice: Issues, Policies, and Solutions, p. 209-212)&#xD;
 Although the post-World…as a goal.  &#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;
&#xD;
Contention Three is Nuclear Colonialism:\\&#xD;
&#xD;
Increased solar power displaces the need for nuclear energy&#xD;
 UPI, 11 (United Press International, “Cheap solar energy set to displace n-power”,[[http:~~/~~/www.upi.com/Business_News/Energy-Resources/2011/01/28/Cheap-solar-energy-set-to-displace-n-power/UPI-61211296221080/&amp;#62;&amp;#62;url:http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Energy-Resources/2011/01/28/Cheap-solar-energy-set-to-displace-n-power/UPI-61211296221080/]]&#xD;
 New research has…kilowatt in 2011.&#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;

Revitalizing brownfields is key to the solar industry – reduces costs.&#xD;

&#xD;
 &#xD;
&#xD;
Nuclear energy production cycle is built on destruction of Native American and minority communities&#xD;
 CANE 7 (9/7/07 Coalition against nuclear energy, [[http:~~/~~/209.85.141.104/search?q=cache:zorzbFAnhq8J:www.cane.org.za/2007/09/10/nuclear-energy-related/environmental-racism/+Nuclear+waste+dumping+racism+Africanandhl=enandct=clnkandcd=3andgl=us)&amp;#62;&amp;#62;url:http://209.85.141.104/search?q=cache:zorzbFAnhq8J:www.cane.org.za/2007/09/10/nuclear-energy-related/environmental-racism/+Nuclear+waste+dumping+racism+Africanandhl=enandct=clnkandcd=3andgl=us)]]&#xD;
 “The nuclear chain…and Mexican Americans. &#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;
&#xD;
Nuclear power is the driving force behind nuclear colonization and genocide of Native Americans.&#xD;
 Collins and Hall 94 (Nancy Collins, Professor of law at Richmond, and Andrea Hall, J.D. Richmond, 6-1994, 12 Law and Ineq. J. 267)&#xD;
 Three interrelated paradoxes…dime from it.&#xD;

 &#xD;
&#xD;
GENOCIDE OUTWEIGHS ALL IMPACTS&#xD;
 Harff-Gur 81 (B, Northwestern, HUMANITARIAN INTERVENTION AS A REMEDY FOR GENOCIDE, p. 40)&#xD;
 One of the…a universal concern.&#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;
&#xD;
Thus the plan: The United States federal government should substantially reduce liability under the Comprehensive Environmental Responses, Compensation and Liability Act for entities that pursue solar energy production on Environmental Protection Agency-designated brownfield sites in the United States. &#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;
&#xD;
Contention Four is Solvency:\\&#xD;
&#xD;
Brightfields create urban revitalization – community involvement, environmental justice, energy production, health and environmental concerns, economic development, and aesthetics are just a few of the results.&#xD;
 Renewable Energy Focus 7 [“Waste to Watts,” March/April,[[http:~~/~~/www.renewableenergyfocus.com/articles/solarpass/features/Waste_to_watts.pdf&amp;#62;&amp;#62;url:http://www.renewableenergyfocus.com/articles/solarpass/features/Waste_to_watts.pdf]]]&#xD;
 Many urban areas…of these applications.&#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;
&#xD;
Brownfields are a key test market for renewables – they enable a transition that reduces climate change and promotes solar power.&#xD;
 Northeast-Midwest Institute 8 [Northeast-Midwest Institute, The National Brownfields Coalition, “A&#xD;
 Proposal to Establish Pilots for Sustainable Development and Alternative Energy Reuse of Brownfields,” March,&#xD;

 The third opportunity…revenue for thecommunity.14&#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;
&#xD;
Brightfields, or brownfield projects using alternative energy, are key to reversing the cycle of urban abandonment – the plan is key to creating a model that spills over to other urban renewal projects. ONLY Brightfields create environmental justice and sustainability &#xD;
 Moskal 3 [John, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, April, “Brockton Brightfields: InnovativeGreen Power Marketing Pilot,” [[http:~~/~~/www.epa.gov/swerrims~~/~~/docs/iwg/BrocktonBrightfieldsfinal.pdf&amp;#62;&amp;#62;url:http://www.epa.gov/swerrims/docs/iwg/BrocktonBrightfieldsfinal.pdf]]]&#xD;
 Monetizing the environmental…for all stakeholders.&#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;
&#xD;
Liability issues make investors wary of assuming risk for contaminated sites, exacerbating brownfield problems like loss of jobs, sprawl, lack of EJ&#xD;
 Bjelland 2 (Mark D, Assistant prof of Geo., GustavusAdolphusCollege, Until justice or stewardship embrace: Or, how a geographer thinks about Brownfield sites, Christian Scholar&amp;#39;s Review. Holland: Summer 2002. Vol. 31, Iss. 4; pg. 393, 20 pgs, Proquest)&#xD;
 The proliferation of…environmental justice concern.&#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;
&#xD;
A large-scale brightfields initiative is key to make wide-ranging urban revitalization possible – plan is modeled internationally.&#xD;
