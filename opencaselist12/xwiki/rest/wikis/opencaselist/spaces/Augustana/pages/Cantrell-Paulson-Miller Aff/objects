Contention One – the Military Industrial Complex\\&#xD;
&#xD;
Mass subsidization of defense contracting blocks sustainable energy from coming online.  This breeds economic dependence on war while funneling industrial development into unending military accumulation.&#xD;
 Feldman 7 (Jonathan, associate professor of economic history at Stockholm University, “From Warfare State to &amp;#34;Shadow State&amp;#34;: Militarism, Economic Depletion, and Reconstruction,” Social Text, 25(2), Summer)&#xD;
 Lying behind the…for soldiers’ pay.&#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;
&#xD;
Ever increasing defense contracts are justified by the institutionalization of threat inflation.  Mass military spending has become the norm as new threats build a mutually dependent relationship between the national security state and neoconservative hawks.&#xD;
 Scheer 8 (Robert, clinical professor of communications at the University of Southern California&amp;#39;s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, former Vietnam correspondent, managing editor and editor in chief of Ramparts magazine, former national correspondent for the Los Angeles Times 1976-1993), former Poynter Fellow at Yale, and former fellow in arms control at Stanford,  The Pornography of Power: How Defense Hawks Hijacked 9/11 and Weakened America, pp. xi-xvii )&#xD;
 I bring it…it became institutionalized.&#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;
&#xD;
The mere availability of weapons creates a constant preparation for war that is the primary source of global conflict.&#xD;
 Hossein-zadeh 6 (Ismael, professor of economics at Drake University, The Political Economy of Militarism, pp. 96-97)&#xD;
 Led by the…of other nations.&amp;#34;41&#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;
&#xD;
Weapons manufacturing hypnotizes us into a sense of fear and panic that demands silence to ensure its survival – the products created by this system are the greatest source of terror and violence in recorded history, responsible for more deaths in the past 50 years than the past two thousand combined.&#xD;

 At this stage…millions of people?&#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;
&#xD;
Contention Two – Blackouts\\&#xD;
&#xD;
Grid vulnerability is high now due to band-aidsolutions that rely on fossil fuels – failure is inevitable, collapsing civilization.  Innovative financing for distributed generation is the only way to reduce the risk of blackouts.&#xD;
 Cooper 12 (John, President of NextWatt Solutions and Ecomergence, “Our Outdated Electrical Grid: An Intolerable Situation,” The Energy Collective, 7/3, [[http:~~/~~/theenergycollective.com/node/90021)&amp;#62;&amp;#62;url:http://theenergycollective.com/node/90021)]]&#xD;
 As outages stretch…and persistent vulnerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;
&#xD;
Blackouts risk hundreds of nuclear meltdowns across the country.&#xD;
 Caldicott 5 (Helen, Australian physician who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1985 and president of the Nuclear Policy Research Institute, “U.S. Russia still face mutual destruction threat,”UPS, 5/18,[[http:~~/~~/www.physicsforums.com/archive/index.php/t-77621.html)&amp;#62;&amp;#62;url:http://www.physicsforums.com/archive/index.php/t-77621.html)]]&#xD;
 This would of…easy to do. &#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;
&#xD;
Grid instability results in accidents worse than nuclear war.&#xD;

 The scariest thing…entire grid system.&#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;
&#xD;
Renewable sources are already facing supply side constraints – Demand will continue to grow as rising consumption faces inadequate availability of fossil fuels.  Now is the key time to create proactive financial incentives for the global transition to renewable alternatives.&#xD;
 General Atlantic 7 (Global growth investors, “Energy and resources,” 11/9,[[http:~~/~~/www.generalatlantic.com/en/news/article/35)&amp;#62;&amp;#62;url:http://www.generalatlantic.com/en/news/article/35)]]&#xD;
 The economic and…more energy efficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;
&#xD;
Distributed generation creates storage solutions that provide stable sources of power capable of overcoming concerns of intermittency.&#xD;
 Behles 12 (Deborah, Associate Professor of Law and Clinical Staff Attorney, Environmental Law and Justice Clinic, Golden Gate University School of Law, “An Integrated Green Urban Electrical Grid,” 36 Wm. and Mary Envtl. L. andPol&amp;#39;y Rev. 671, Spring, L/N)&#xD;
 Distributed energy storage…way for renewables. n103&#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;
&#xD;
Thus the Plan:&#xD;
 The United States federal government should substantially increase financial incentives for the conversion of domestic weapons production to domestic distributed solar and wind power production in the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;
&#xD;
Contention Two – Defense Conversion\\&#xD;
&#xD;
Redirecting defense spending towards solar and wind development eliminates the self-justifying nature of the military industrial complex.&#xD;
 Cervinka 12 (Vashek, Program Manager of Design Competition, Author of “Questions We Have Forgotten to Ask,” “Build an energy-industrial complex,” The Davis Enterprise, 3/22, [[http:~~/~~/www.davisenterprise.com/forum/opinion-columns/build-an-energy-industrial-complex/)&amp;#62;&amp;#62;url:http://www.davisenterprise.com/forum/opinion-columns/build-an-energy-industrial-complex/)]]&#xD;
 TheUnited States…and national security.&#xD;
&#xD;

Incentives for defense conversion to alternative energy contains the power of the military-industrial complex – defense contractors are ready and willing to make the shift if the federal government articulates a clear vision for change.&#xD;
 Rifkin 90 (Jeremy, President of the Greenhouse Crisis Foundation, “Turning Arms Into a ‘Green Dividend’,” Washington Post, 4/15, L/N)&#xD;
 FOR MOST of…toward this goal.&#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;
&#xD;
Funding for U.S. military procurement contracts should be reallocated tax incentives for defense conversion to renewable energy.  Federal action is necessary and will set the global agenda toward transitioning to renewable energy.  &#xD;
 Partridge 6 (Ernest, consultant, writer and lecturer in the field of Environmental Ethics and Public Policy, taught Philosophy at the University of California, and in Utah, Colorado and Wisconsin, “Swords into Plowshares,” 5/30,[[http:~~/~~/www.crisispapers.org/essays6p/swords.htm)&amp;#62;&amp;#62;url:http://www.crisispapers.org/essays6p/swords.htm)]]&#xD;

European conversion proves – the plan is a both reorientation of defense hardware and a restructuring of values at the individual, national and international level.&#xD;

 Despite a lot…restructuring of concepts.&#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;
&#xD;
The transition to defense conversion won’t cause an attack on the US or extinction – however, the permanent war making machine could end all human life.  Its try or die for the affirmative.&#xD;

&#xD;
Warming induced sea level rise will leave the world’s poorest groups adversely affected with no means of adaptation.&#xD;
Garvey 8 (James, Secretary Royal Instit Philosophy, The Ethics of Climate Change)&#xD;
Now consider anticipated…by climate change.23 &#xD;
&#xD;
Warming also guarantees massive species extinction.&#xD;

Climate change is…to human society.&#xD;
&#xD;
Mourning the extinction of any creature in the odyssey of evolution enables humans to become co-passengers on the ship where we live and let live and wonder in the magnitude and duration of the biotic community.  &#xD;

Here I will…for us all.&#xD;
&#xD;
We are ethically obligated to act even in the face of consequentialist or utilitarian demands – our action can’t be contingent on the actions of others but rather should serve as the starting point for setting an example for others to follow. &#xD;
Garvey 8 (James, Secretary Royal Instit Philosophy, The Ethics of Climate Change, pp. 108-110)&#xD;
One of the…be given up.&#xD;
&#xD;
You should take a geologic sense of time – our ecological footprint last for hundreds of years while the planet&amp;#39;s regulatory system works at glacial speeds.  Acting now is critical to slowing the rate of climate change and giving the planet a chance for adaptation – delays magnify the impact.  Doing nothing is not an option.  &#xD;
Garvey 8 (James, Secretary Royal Instit Philosophy, The Ethics of Climate Change, pp. 111-112)&#xD;
