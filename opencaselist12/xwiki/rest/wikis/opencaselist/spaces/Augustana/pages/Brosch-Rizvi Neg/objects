Link – The affirmative’s approach and objectives are thoroughly anthropocentric – they view the environment as a resource to be used for human benefit, they center their justification for action around humanity’s survival and subjugate all other needs of nature to the interests of humanity.  This approach denies nature’s intrinsic worth and precludes a deep ecological approach.&#xD;

This round represents a starting point for creating a genuine encounter with the otherness of nature by providing context for a shared conversation with the world around us.  Questioning our own subject position starting with the consideration of anthropocentrism creates space for constructing a systematic framework that allows for the ethical connection with the world.&#xD;

The 1AC remains imbedded within the orthodox script by which intellectuals participate in the continued domination of indigenous peoples in Native North America, reproducing the very systems of power that make their particular atrocities inevitable.  Even if the affirmative resolves their specific demands, the resulting society is still defined by an adamant desire to remain comfortable in the extermination of indigenous peoples.  &#xD;
&#xD;
The first priority for this debate is decolonization of indigenous lands – anything short reinforces participation in the colonial order.&#xD;

The genocidal mentality that legitimates colonial control ensures that the earth will become uninhabitable due to radioactive colonization – only abandoning  the core belief that Americans have a legitimate right to this land can alter this thinking.&#xD;

What happens to indigenous peoples in this country is part and parcel to the logic that will inevitably infect us all – ignorance to the effects of controlling indigenous populations ensures that we will all be relegated to the status of irrelevancy.&#xD;

Every successful attempt at decolonization can reverse the course of inevitable extinction that arises from colonialism’s exploitation of the earth and its inhabitants.&#xD;

 It is worth…of life itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
The alternative – reject the Affirmative and embrace indigenous land return as the first priority.  &#xD;
&#xD;
United States out of Indian Country.  United States out of North America.  US off the planet.&#xD;
&#xD;
The alternative is the ultimate example of the impossibility of politics – decolonization is rendered unspeakable because it is always discussed from within the colonial paradigm.  We must accept that what is right is not the same as what is realistic – it’s the struggle for decolonization that makes the process of the alternative emancipatory in and of itself.  Any permutation shares the loot of colonialism by redistributing power in such a way as to preserve the illegal occupation of Native North America.  Only embracing our first priority can enable a form of “impossible realism” that makes the elimination of specific forms of oppression possible.&#xD;
