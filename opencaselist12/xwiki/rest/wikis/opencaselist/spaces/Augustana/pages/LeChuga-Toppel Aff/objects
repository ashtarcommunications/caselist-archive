Contention One is the Status Quo:\\

Limited CO2 availability makes further EOR uneconomical
 NRDC, 08 (National Resource Defense Council, “Tapping into Stranded Domestic Oil: Enhanced Oil Recovery with Carbon Dioxide Is a Win-Win-Win”, [[http:~~/~~/www.nrdc.org/energy/eor.pdf)&amp;#62;&amp;#62;url:http://www.nrdc.org/energy/eor.pdf)]] 
 Growth of CO2-EOR…supplement natural sources. 

 

CO2 enhanced oil recovery is a proven method to increase oil yields but there must be expansion
 NEORI, 12 (National Enhanced Oil Recovery Initiative, “CARBON DIOXIDE ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY: A CRITICAL DOMESTIC ENERGY, ECONOMIC, AND ENVIRONMENTAL OPPORTUNITY”, [[http:~~/~~/www.neori.org/NEORI_Report.pdf)&amp;#62;&amp;#62;url:http://www.neori.org/NEORI_Report.pdf)]] 
 A largely unheralded…atmosphere (ARI, 2011).

 

Thus the Plan: The United States federal government should substantially increase domestic production of crude oil by providing a production tax credit for carbon dioxide use in enhanced oil recovery.

 

Contention Two is Foreign Dependency:\\

EOR significantly reduces US reliance on foreign oil supplies
 NEORI, 12 (National Enhanced Oil Recovery Initiative, “CARBON DIOXIDE ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY: A CRITICAL DOMESTIC ENERGY, ECONOMIC, AND ENVIRONMENTAL OPPORTUNITY”, [[http:~~/~~/www.neori.org/NEORI_Report.pdf)&amp;#62;&amp;#62;url:http://www.neori.org/NEORI_Report.pdf)]]
 Reliance on oil…on foreign oil. 

 

Reducing reliance on foreign supplies key to hegemony and US primacy
 Haass, 08 (Richard N. Haass, President, Council on Foreign Relations, Foreign Affairs , May/June 2008 ,[[http:~~/~~/www.foreignaffairs.org/20080501faessay87304/richard-n-haass/the-age-of-nonpolarity.html?mode=print)&amp;#62;&amp;#62;url:http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20080501faessay87304/richard-n-haass/the-age-of-nonpolarity.html?mode=print)]]
 But even if…major power centers.  

 

US leadership solves nuke war, democracy, free trade, and conflicts globally 
 Khalilzad 95 

AND foreign dependence handicaps the war on terror
 Lantos, 02 (Rep. Tom Lantos, Hearing of House International Relations Committee, FNS, June 20, 2002)
 (D-CA): Thank you…out of dependency.

 

Terrorism risks extinction
 Alexander, 03 (Yonah Alexander, Inter-University for Terrorism Studies Director, The Washington Times, &amp;#34;Terrorism myths and realities,&amp;#34; 8/28)
 Last week&amp;#39;s brutal…global security concerns. 

 

Contention Three is the Trade Deficit:\\

Trade deficit increases from oil destroy multiple industries and future economic growth
 DCES, 12 (Diplomatic Council on Energy Security, “Oil and the Trade Deficit”, [[http:~~/~~/www.ourenergypolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DCES-Oil-and-the-Trade-Deficit.pdf)&amp;#62;&amp;#62;url:http://www.ourenergypolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DCES-Oil-and-the-Trade-Deficit.pdf)]]
 Lending and borrowing…foreign capital inflows. 

 

Deficit growth creates an economic meltdown
 DCES, 12 (Diplomatic Council on Energy Security, “Oil and the Trade Deficit”, [[http:~~/~~/www.ourenergypolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DCES-Oil-and-the-Trade-Deficit.pdf)&amp;#62;&amp;#62;url:http://www.ourenergypolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DCES-Oil-and-the-Trade-Deficit.pdf)]]
 Although the U.S…the U.S. government. 

 

Economic collapse culminates in extinction and complete destruction of the biosphere
 Bearden 2k (Liutenant Colonel, Lieutenant Colonel in the U.S. Army,  www.cheniere.org/techpapers/Unnecessary%20Energy%20Crisis.doc) ET
 Bluntly, we foresee…for many decades. 

 

Contention Four is the Environment:\\

CO2 captured for EOR can eliminate the equivalent of CO2 emissions from power plants for ten to twenty years
 NEORI, 12 (National Enhanced Oil Recovery Initiative, “CARBON DIOXIDE ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY: A CRITICAL DOMESTIC ENERGY, ECONOMIC, AND ENVIRONMENTAL OPPORTUNITY”, [[http:~~/~~/www.neori.org/NEORI_Report.pdf)&amp;#62;&amp;#62;url:http://www.neori.org/NEORI_Report.pdf)]]
 Regarding the benefits…40 CFR §144). 

 

CO2 emissions from humans are the main cause of global warming
 Sakar, 10 (Ajoy, Engineer at Indian Institute of Materials Management, “Carbon Footprint – A cause of Global Warming”,[[http:~~/~~/www.iimmmumbai.org/article-category/carbon-footprint-%E2%80%93-a-cause-of-global-warming)&amp;#62;&amp;#62;url:http://www.iimmmumbai.org/article-category/carbon-footprint-%E2%80%93-a-cause-of-global-warming)]]
 The total amount…for global warming. 

 

Warming causes extinction
 Tickel 8 (Oliver, Climate Researcher. The Gaurdian, 8-11-2008,[[http:~~/~~/www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/aug/11/climatechange)&amp;#62;&amp;#62;url:http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/aug/11/climatechange)]] ET
 We need to…similar hothouse Earth. 

 

Contention Five is Solvency:\\

Federal PTC for CO2 capture is revenue positive, helps the environment, and stimulates major new oil recovery
 NEORI, 12 (National Enhanced Oil Recovery Initiative, “CARBON DIOXIDE ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY: A CRITICAL DOMESTIC ENERGY, ECONOMIC, AND ENVIRONMENTAL OPPORTUNITY”, [[http:~~/~~/www.neori.org/NEORI_Report.pdf)&amp;#62;&amp;#62;url:http://www.neori.org/NEORI_Report.pdf)]] 
 NEORI’s centerpiece recommendation…in the process. 

 

PTC for CO2 infrastructure removes only critical restraint on increased oil recovery
 NEORI, 12 (National Enhanced Oil Recovery Initiative, “CARBON DIOXIDE ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY: A CRITICAL DOMESTIC ENERGY, ECONOMIC, AND ENVIRONMENTAL OPPORTUNITY”, [[http:~~/~~/www.neori.org/NEORI_Report.pdf)&amp;#62;&amp;#62;url:http://www.neori.org/NEORI_Report.pdf)]]
 While the business…and gas fields. 

 

Federal incentives critical to spur EOR and have caused development in the past
 Duda, 10 (John, Director of the Strategic Center for Natural Gas and Oil, “Carbon Dioxide Enhanced Oil Recovery”,[[http:~~/~~/www.netl.doe.gov/technologies/oil-gas/publications/EP/small_CO2_eor_primer.pdf)&amp;#62;&amp;#62;url:http://www.netl.doe.gov/technologies/oil-gas/publications/EP/small_CO2_eor_primer.pdf)]]
 It is important…CO2 injection costs.

 

CO2-EOR solves energy dependency, boosts the economy, and helps the environment
 NEORI, 12 (National Enhanced Oil Recovery Initiative, “CARBON DIOXIDE ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY: A CRITICAL DOMESTIC ENERGY, ECONOMIC, AND ENVIRONMENTAL OPPORTUNITY”, [[http:~~/~~/www.neori.org/NEORI_Report.pdf)&amp;#62;&amp;#62;url:http://www.neori.org/NEORI_Report.pdf)]] 
 Amidst economic uncertainty…and gas production.
