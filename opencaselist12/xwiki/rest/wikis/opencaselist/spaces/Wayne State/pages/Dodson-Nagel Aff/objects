==Death of the Clinic 1AC==

====Observation 0: War of the Worlds====

=====Modernity posits policy on the explanation that &amp;#34;our&amp;#34; ontology composes the natural language of the world.  The west polices to deny the fact that we are at war, a war of modernity against progress.=====
**Latour 2002** (Bruno, Professor at ENS-Paris, War of the Worlds, p. 2-9) ~~[MRL~~]
The word &amp;#34;war&amp;#34; is spewing out …known by Reason.
 

=====Biology has ceased to exist – genetics and cybernetics code the body as communication. The control of the environment, where identity is evolutionary - is a form of control of populations=====
**Haraway 1991** (Donna Jeanne, Simians, Cyborgs, and Women. &amp;#34;I would rather be a cyborg than a goddess&amp;#34; p. 57-9, 61-4) ~~[Nagel~~]
Organic engineering based on the person … genetic profit. 
 

=====The modern West plays the Gatekeeper of Ontology:  Instead of naturalizing these assumptions into facticity, we need to confront the Gorgon of this bifurcation of nature: =====
**Latour 2002** (Bruno, Professor at ENS-Paris, War of the Worlds, p. 30-33, 39-42) ~~[MRL~~]
Whatever follows modernism at least … bad constructions of worlds.
 

=====Totalities can only understand oppression through exclusion. Instead, we should seek to responsibly constitute resistance, neither through difference nor reinscription of domination. =====
**Haraway 1991** (Donna Jeanne, Simians, Cyborgs, and Women. &amp;#34;I would rather be a cyborg than a goddess&amp;#34; p. 159-161) ~~[Nagel~~] 
Beyond either the difficulties … knowing the difference. 
 

=====Therefore we offer the following plan:=====

=====The United States federal government should substantially increase financial incentives for subdermal solar panels. We reserve the right to clarify.=====
 

===Observation 1: Death of the Clinic===

====We are cyborgs – an affirmation of impurity and blasphemy. We offer this trope as a means of navigating a new construction of differences free of Oedipus ====
**Haraway 1991** (Donna Jeanne, Simians, Cyborgs, and Women. &amp;#34;I would rather be a cyborg than a goddess&amp;#34; p. 149-151) ~~[Nagel~~]
AN IRONIC DREAM OF A COMMON LANGUAGE FOR WOMEN IN THE INTEGRATED CIRCUIT

Organic engineering based on the person … genetic profit. 
 

=====The modern West plays the Gatekeeper of Ontology:  Instead of naturalizing these assumptions into facticity, we need to confront the Gorgon of this bifurcation of nature: =====
**Latour 2002** (Bruno, Professor at ENS-Paris, War of the Worlds, p. 30-33, 39-42) ~~[MRL~~]
Whatever follows modernism at least … bad constructions of worlds.

Kientz ’12, Robert has been an investor for many years and has 7 years experience working as a corporate auditor and has 13 years corporate working experience. Robert earned his Series 6, 63, and 7 licenses 10 years ago while working as a broker dealer for a large, multinational company. In addition, Robert earned a Series 3 options license in 2009 while working for a forex broker. Robert formed a real estate property management firm in 2000 to assist property owners in the North Texas area to increase their profits by providing high quality, best of market rentals for their tenants. Since founding, Robert has reduced vacancies by an average of 2 months per year per property, and increased cash flow by increasing rental demand and therefore timely rent payments. By renovating existing rental inventory to best of market and expanding property marketing techniques, the real estate company locates the best tenants and keeps revenues consistent in a tough real estate market. After working in finance and corporate audit for many years, Robert retired to become a full time property manager, real estate investor, trader, and author. Robert started the Drop Shadow website (http:~/~/www.thedropshadow.com) in 2010. As a former corporate auditor, Robert possesses a unique view into business operations and controls and how they affect and interact with the strategic business plans of the company. The experience in Audit taught Robert various best of business practices, whose application to his investment strategies increased revenues and efficiency while reducing costly overhead. 8-28, Forex Pros, Investing In Natural Gas, Part 2, http:~~/~~/www.forexpros.com/analysis/investing-in-natural-gas,-part-2-134421url:http://www.forexpros.com/analysis/investing-in-natural-gas,-part-2-134421, jj&#xD;

With the current price situation, there may be an opportunity for natural gas to replace coal …………. If natural gas drillers simply slow down production, and sell natural gas to coal-users, they can shift the supply curve lower and increase demand, causing natural gas prices to increase and possibly reach levels seen in early 2008.&#xD;

HIGHLIGHT: LNG exports to Asia could provide a way out of an oversupplied market ……. can open a market for North America - and especially Canada - worth billions of dollars.&amp;#34;

 

 

 

Thus, the plan:

The United States federal government should substantially reduce restrictions on natural gas production in the United States by repealing the Environmental Protection Agency’s New Source Performance Standards and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants Reviews for natural gas production. The United States federal government should issue a moratorium on further federal restrictions on natural gas production in the United States.

Alarm bells are going off everywhere regarding the state of the economy, from the crumbling ……….. but now we just have to add the recession element to the equation.&amp;#34;

 

 

The economy’s on the brink ~-~~-~- supercharges the risk of the impact

RAMPELL ’11 – economics reporter for The New York Times; wrote for the Washington Post editorial pages and financial section (Catherine, “Second Recession in U.S. Could Be Worse Than First”. August 7. http:~/~/www.nytimes.com/2011/08/08/business/a-second-recession-could-be-much-worse-than-the-first.html?pagewanted=all)

 

If the economy falls back into recession, as many economists are now warning, the bloodletting could be a lot more painful …….. there was also a premature withdrawal of fiscal stimulus, and the economy fell into another recession more painful than the first.”

 

 

The US is key to the global economy ~-~~-~- decline causes war.

The first consideration has to do with the sheer gravity of the situation. What is at stake goes beyond an abstract rate of unemployment, or the prospect of a Republican White House in 2012, or even the misery of the long-term unemployed. From the beginning, this recession has been global. Germany has to take leadership in Europe, but …….d be far more serious than the ruckus that Tea Party and Republican opposition could create over the next year.

 

Regional economic decline draws in great powers

The second scenario, called Mayhem and Chaos, is the opposite of the first scenario; everything that can go wrong does go wrong. ……..major disruptions can be expected, with dire consequences for two-thirds of the planet’s population.

Less intuitive is how periods of economic decline may increase the likelihood of external conflict. ……….. This implied connection between integration, crises and armed conflict has not featured prominently in the economic-security debate and deserves more attention.

HIGHLIGHT: LNG exports to Asia could provide a way out of an oversupplied market ……. can open a market for North America - and especially Canada - worth billions of dollars.&amp;#34;

 

 

 

Thus, the plan:

The United States federal government should substantially reduce restrictions on natural gas production in the United States by repealing the Environmental Protection Agency’s New Source Performance Standards and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants Reviews for natural gas production. The United States federal government should issue a moratorium on further federal restrictions on natural gas production in the United States.

==== Current environmental practices justify an anthropocentric mastery of nature as a peaceful place for stability. This attempt for subjective control has derailed the environmental movement. ====

Goh 2008 (Irving, Professor at Cornell University and Visiting Fellow at Harvard University. “’Strange Ecology’ in Deleuze and Guattari’s A Thousand Plateaus”. //An Unlikely Alliance: Thinking Environment(s) with Deleuze|Guattari//. Cambridge Scholars Publishing. Newcastle upon Tyne, UK. 2008. pg. 197-198) nagel

 

Where I will depart, however, from Conley&amp;#39;s book, is the perspective on &amp;#34;ecological consciousness.&amp;#34; As suggested in the opening paragraph here, ………….  it would be more critical to discern a consciousness that uproots (from) Nature and see what new ensemble Nature and thought can form through this peculiar relation. This, to reiterate, is what this paper will take as its task to elucidate.

 

==== Our flawed epistemological understanding of the environment continues to replicate failed policy solutions. Only a complex understanding shatters the false binary between humans and nature. ====

Haferkamp 2008 (Leyla, PhD Candidate and Professor at the University of Cologne. “Processing Ecology with Deleuze”. //An Unlikely Alliance: Thinking Environment(s) with Deleuze|Guattari//. Cambridge Scholars Publishing. Newcastle upon Tyne, UK. 2008. pg. 61-63) nagel

 

This reconciliation of the external world with the individual via the concept, often corresponding to the triad &amp;#34;scenographies-definitions-points of view,&amp;#34; makes possible what Serres has called Leibniz&amp;#39;s &amp;#34;ichnographic chart of the Universe&amp;#34; (161n11), ………, ecological relation is the most important consequence of &amp;#34;the eco-mental system called Lake Erie is part of your wider eco-mental system – and that if Lake Erie is driven insane, its insanity is incorporated in the larger system of your thought and experience&amp;#34; (Bateson 492).

 

==== We reject this dualism in favor of an ecological view of constant flux and change. Instead affirm an affective relationship to the Earth in order to grasp its complexity. ====

Hayden 2008 (Patrick, Senior Lecturer of Politics and Philosophy at the University of St. Andrews. “Gilles Deleuze and Naturalism”. //An Unlikely Alliance: Thinking Environment(s) with Deleuze|Guattari//. Cambridge Scholars Publishing. Newcastle upon Tyne, UK. 2008. pg. 29-31) nagel

 

In works written in collaboration with Félix Guattari, Deleuze continues to articulate a strongly naturalistic basis for philosophical practice. In their final work together What is Philosophy? Deleuze and Guattari claim that &amp;#34;thinking takes place in the relationship of territory and the earth&amp;#34; (85……… The wasp becomes part of the orchid&amp;#39;s reproductive apparatus at the same time as the orchid becomes the sexual organ of the wasp. (Dialogues 2)

 

==== There is no distinction between policies - the difference in proposed solutions is not the problem itself but the way it is understood ====

Hajer 1995 (Maarten A. Hajer, Professor of Political Science and Public Policy and Head of Department at the University of Amsterdam, 1995, The Politics of Environmental Discourse, p. 14-15) nagel

 

What is forgotten is the issue of representation. As Benton and Redclift rightly ask, ‘Do we share an understanding of the global environment ………. The book aims to bring out the extent to which the practices of policy-making succeed in regulating social conflicts over environmental matters.

**~ **

**Continued control of nature abolishes humanity and the environment in the name of survival, risking self-annihilation.**

**Beck 1995** (Ulrich, professor of sociology at Munich University and at the London School of Economics, (“Ecological Enlightenment”, translated by Mark Ritter, page 37-39) nagel

 

People have begun to question modernity. It is not that they no longer appreciate its advantages or that they no longer know how to live in and from it. But, its premises have begun to wobble…….. implicitly abolished once again if our concern is limited to modernity’s impact on nature and health? Isn’t humankind then reduced to its biological basis – a reduction with which we in Germany are only too familiar?

 

=== Observation 2 – The Solutions ===

==== Ecology has ceded traditional politics, abandoning communities and makes extinction inevitable. Only through a localized focus of resistance can we create an effective eco-politics that has any hope of macro change. ====

Hayden 2008 (Patrick, Senior Lecturer of Politics and Philosophy at the University of St. Andrews. “Gilles Deleuze and Naturalism”. //An Unlikely Alliance: Thinking Environment(s) with Deleuze|Guattari//. Cambridge Scholars Publishing. Newcastle upon Tyne, UK. 2008. pg. 33-35) nagel

 

The strength of Deleuze&amp;#39;s affirmation of naturalism is that it focuses on the ethical and political issues associated with the destruction of the Earth&amp;#39;s multiple environments, ranging from………… habitats overlap and combine with others at various points and have a global impact with respect to the planetary ecosystem.

 

==== Current movements have failed to grasp complexity through their focus on pragmatism. We must place ourselves as the Instructed Third, an organized community between the social and the natural. ====

Haferkamp 2008 (Leyla, PhD Candidate and Professor at the University of Cologne. “Processing Ecology with Deleuze”. //An Unlikely Alliance: Thinking Environment(s) with Deleuze|Guattari//. Cambridge Scholars Publishing. Newcastle upon Tyne, UK. 2008. pg. 54-56) nagel

 

Despite this systemic complexity, within the current discourse of popular &amp;#39;lifestyle ecology,&amp;#39; the whole range of environmental problems seems to have been downsized to the &amp;#39;inconvenient truth&amp;#39; of global warming. While climate change does indeed pose an immense challenge……….. subjects of law and objects of science – without observing that these entities had been shaped, profiled, and sculpted in such a way that they had gradually become incompatible. (3, emphasis added)

 

==== Our affect towards infinite possibilities blurs the micro-macro distinction. Only this openness provides the possibility for ethical action within the moral framework of nature. ====

Butler 2008 (Edward, PhD in Philosophy from the New School for Social Research in New York City. “Deleuzian Humanism and Deep Ecology”. //An Unlikely Alliance: Thinking Environment(s) with Deleuze|Guattari//. Cambridge Scholars Publishing. Newcastle upon Tyne, UK. 2008. pg. 140-141) nagel

 

The notion of a preconceptual plane of immanence which is the principle of individuation for concepts, subjects and facts alike could be considered Deleuze&amp;#39;s philosophical first principle.1 ………. As all relations are combined in Nature as a whole, Nature presents a similarity of composition that may be seen in all bodies from the most general viewpoint. (Expressionism 275)

 

==== Our ethical framework is to engage both ecological and local concerns. Universal solutions are co-opted by hegemonic ideologies. Our advocacy is necessary to empower individuals and curtail failed macro-politics. ====

Butler 2008 (Edward, PhD in Philosophy from the New School for Social Research in New York City. “Deleuzian Humanism and Deep Ecology”. //An Unlikely Alliance: Thinking Environment(s) with Deleuze|Guattari//. Cambridge Scholars Publishing. Newcastle upon Tyne, UK. 2008. pg. 146-147) nagel

 

Rather than an abstract concept, or, worse, a mystical construct, intrinsic value can thus be seen as a kind of regulative ideal……….. recourse to the universal implies the relationship of antagonism or decomposition between individuals.

 

==== The United States federal government should remove all restrictions on topical energy production in the United States. ====

 

==== Plan action opens affective space to create a paradigm shift in how we approach global problems. By changing control of the state, we can overcome the failed political practices of the past. ====

Heroux 2008 (Erick, PhD in Philosophy from the New School for Social Research in New York City. “Guattari’s Triplex Discourses of Ecology”. //An Unlikely Alliance: Thinking Environment(s) with Deleuze|Guattari//. Cambridge Scholars Publishing. Newcastle upon Tyne, UK. 2008. pg. 182-185) nagel

 

Now that we have the gist of this alternative theoretical biology, it should be both more obvious and more resonant that the lead epigraph for Guattari&amp;#39;s booklet The Three Ecologies is from Bateson: &amp;#34;….. another molecular revolution vis-à-vis global climate change will have happened, resulting also in new subjectivities, new agencies, new solidarities.</headline></objectSummary></objects>
