You should affirm the non-knowledge of the topic: the world is a boundless play of aesthetic forces, ever changing – we try to know about things like solar energy or climate change, but we can’t know everything – there’s always an accursed share of non-knowledge: something that is in excess of our ability to completely understand it, something that we can’t know because it is excluded in the very process of systematic thinking – affirm our ontological vision of a topic and world formed by a play of forces that are always in excess of our ability to know them – we need to accept the lack, the laceration, the empty space of non-knowledge within our knowledge about the environment – we need to stop trying to stockpile and exhaust the utility of the topic – environmental security tries to fight loss by archiving biological life but repressing animality and loss just destroys ethics and banalizes violence – making a cut in the fabric of utility is a pre-requisite to good communication and policy making about the environment

The ‘Play of the World’: Bataille AND to the archive that I now turn.



To endlessly challenge forth knowledge is to enframe everything in the Standing Reserve – The will to reveal an objective picture of reality is coterminous with the selfish “rational utilitarian subject” of modern technology that accumulates and stockpiles energy from the sun – relating to the earth through security, mastery, and total knowing enframes everything in the instrumental mania of the standing reserve – this creates an ongoing logic of concentration camps and destruction of the earth in error replication.
Stoekl ‘7 (Allan Stoekl, “Bataille’s Peak Energy, Religion, and Postsustainability,” p. 128-133, 2007) m leap

The German philosopher Martin AND will be, thankfully, discarded.¶ 


The resolution has an accursed share: the Heterogeneous “other” energy of inner experience that is in excess of our ability to utilize or know it – sacrifice and utilization trade off with each other as ways to deal with this inevitable excess ~-~-- when we give up trying to utilize and accumulate the whole topic then we can adopt a sacrificial deployment of excess – unknowable and useless “other” energy is always a part of, but is also a transgression against, the Homogeneous energy of accumulation, utility, and self-security in the standing reserve – learning to accept the unknowability of accursed share forms an alternative to restricted expenditure because we stop struggling to stockpile excess energy and knowledge for the future use of autonomous subjects 
Stoekl ‘7 (Allan Stoekl, “Bataille’s Peak Energy, Religion, and Postsustainability,” p. 134-137, 2007) m leap

This makes clear, I think, a AND bourgeois mentality. (Goux 1990a, 217)


There’s Utility DA to excluding the accursed share – Sustainability and accumulation are the same: based on this exclusion, they are both forms of BAD expenditure of energy – they take turns propping up a consumer-capitalist restricted economy that is hell-bent on stockpiling and then wasting the earth in the standing reserve – they both assume and require coherent subjects acting in rational self-interest to somehow manage “their” resources in the name of mastery, security, survival and comfort – instead of accepting this vision, we need to affirm the other side of the topic – the inner experience of non-knowledge – affirm the unknown “other” energy that defies mastery through analysis – this kind of intimate communication about the topic is always left out by the attempt to accumulate knowledge and utility – the ethics formed by affirming the accursed share of non-knowledge is the only way to spare the earth from nuclear destruction

The fact that we could end up saving earth from extinction is an issue of secondary relevance to us, not a justification for voting aff – voting aff could end up sparing the earth but only because we give up trying to secure and know everything about the future, which disrupts the stability of the individualist restrained economy – our ethics of general expenditure entails an ecstatic frenzied revolt –eroticism and radical generosity as their own immediate justification – we affirm excess and madness, the intimate underside of human knowing and subjectivity that gets left out of by an exclusive focus on knowing reality

The topic is not reducible to a thing – we can trace it with our knowledge but we cannot stand outside it and describe and reveal it like a picture on the wall – the archival drive to accumulate and preserve objects of knowledge only succeeds in destroying the whole experience by trying to view the topic as a thing and thus reifying and quantifying any sense of play or animality in the resolution – the Archive destroys its contents by trying to accumulate and preserving them – it annihilates the accursed share by trying to catalogue it – attempting to aesthetically encounter the topic forms a better ecological politics than aesthetic representation and accumulation – we should yield to the unthinkable which disrupts the archival drive and allows us to question the creation of a taxonomy of things

The neg is overlimiting which is net worse for things like creativity and unique education—our interpretation allows for their kind of education to exist while their just arbitrarily excludes our form of thinking.


Aff is turns their framework—The topic isn’t reducible to a thing – that’s the Yusoff Reification evidence – their framework operates as an attempt to archive the topic which makes bad political education—this turns their exportable skills impact


The need to create portable skills for future utilization is the ultimate attempt to reduce education to a standing reserve, Attempts to make the most use of our experience here trains us to be ready at hand for later deployment – that’s impacted by our offense against utilitarian future use maximization – the Stoekl ‘Standing Reserve’ and Utility disads as well as the Yusoff ‘non-knowledge’ evidence and the Stoekl ‘Ethics of General Expenditure’ evidence.

Transgression is affirmation——our argument is all about acceptance—revolting against the complete know-ability and represent-ability of the topic is an affirmation of accepting the impossible within the topic – Affirming the resolution doesn’t mean we have to say yes through trying to utilize all of it – the drive to total utilization links to our Stoekl ‘standing reserve’ evidence – our aesthetics generates an affirmative response through interruption – this is not to say that we attempt to block or stop the resolution, but rather that we affirm it through saying that the attempt to know it completely could be interrupted and we can, in doing that, affirm it through a different vision then we do in the status quo – We should declassify the topic – opening ourselves to the excluded experience of the wounds in our knowledge is key – once we truly experience the loss and rage caused by climate change it screams through our the aesthetic order and creates new possibilities for politics and ethics – transgressing knowledge with intimate experience of animality unmasks the restricted economy and its march towards ecological collapse

Fascism is not so much a symptom AND attained the beyond of words? 



And, ceding their political is key to having a good political method – that’s the Yusoff “non-knowledge” evidence – letting go of the utilitarian drive to accumulate knowledge for future use is a pre-requisite to any politics that operates outside of the biopolitical drive to archive and secure life in the standing reserve – that’s also the Stoekl evidence – our Aff is a disad to participating in the negative’s political sphere

**Today, the lands that belong to Native Americans is still under control of White Supremacy. Dylan Rodriguez notes that** “//Variable, overlapping, and mutually constituting white supremacist regimes have in fact been fundamental to the formation and movements of the United States, from racial chattel slavery and frontier genocide to recent and current modes of neoliberal land displacement and (domestic-to-global) warfare. Without exception, these regimes have been differently entangled with the state’s changing paradigms, strategies, and technologies of human incarceration and punishment (to follow the prior examples: the plantation, the reservation, the neoliberal sweatshop, and the domestic-to-global prison)”// (Rodriguez 2007). **Let’s be clear we are not isolating certain people when we say “white supremacy”. Rodriguez further clarifies that** “//white supremacy may be understood as a logic of social organization that produces regimented, institutionalized, and militarized conceptions of hierarchized “human” difference, enforced through coercions and violences that are structured by genocidal possibility (including physical extermination and curtailment of people’s collective capacities to socially, culturally, or biologically reproduce). As a historical vernacular and philosophical apparatus of domination, white supremacy is simultaneously premised on and consistently innovating universalized conceptions of the white (European and euroamerican) “human” vis-à-vis the rigorous production, penal discipline, and frequent social, political, and biological neutralization or extermination of the (non-white) sub- or non-human//” (Rodriguez 2007). **The effects of this hierarchy are still most plainly seen in Native American Communities. For example, there are roughly 4.1 million native Americans in the United States which is 1.5 percent of the overall population. The median household income for native Americans is roughly 14,000 dollars lower than for non-hispanic whites. 25 percent of native Americans are in poverty which is a much higher rate than Caucasians. 27% of Native Americans don’t have healthcare which is 17% more than non-hispanic whites. Among this comes the fact that Native Americans have a higher likelihood of suicide than other ethnicities with suicide being the second highest cause of death amongst ten year olds to thirty four year olds. On a topic about energy production it is worth noting that we are producing energy from and on stolen land. These facts elucidate the time that we are in. Ward Churchill describes our current time very vividly, he notes that **“//At this juncture, the entire planet is locked… in a room with… Hannibal Lecter. An individual of consummate taste and refinement, imbued with indelible grace and charm, he distracts his victims with the brilliance of his intellect, even while honing his blade. He is thus able to dine alone upon their livers… Over and over the ritual is repeated, always hidden, always denied in order that is may be continued. So perfect is Lecter’s pathology that, from the depths of his scorn for the inferiors upon whom he feeds, he advances himself as their sage and therapist… he professes to be their savior. His success depends upon being embraced and exalted by those upon whom he preys. Ultimately, so long as Lecter is able to retain his mask of omnipotent gentility, he can never be stopped. The sociocultural equivalent of Hannibal Lecter is the core of an expansionist European “civilization” which has reached out to engulf the planet//” (Churchill 1996, 14). **The impacts of this expansion should not be understated for they risk the possibility of global decimation. Lilian Friedberg further notes that** “//what is at stake today, at the dawn of a new millennium, is not the culture, tradition, and survival of one population on on continent on either side of the atlantic. What is at stake is the very future of the human species…the survival of Native America is fundamentally about the collective survival of all human beings… it is not about “us” as indigenous peoples – it is about us as a human species. We are all related… we must speak today in terms of the human problem…because is is o longer a matter of serial genocide, it has become one of collective suicide//” (Friedberg 2000).

**So what then is the role of the debater in this particular debate round? What is the role of the critic? These issues are directly tied to the role of scholarship and the academy. What is the role of the scholar? Currently we see that the academy has a very specific purpose, and is far from neutral on the issues noted before. Devon Mihesuah writes that** “//the academy has much invested in maintaining control over who defines knowledge, who has access to knowledge, and who produces knowledge. As indigenous intellectuals committed to our indigenous nations, we threaten the power and authority claimed by institutions, disciplines, and peoples created, in part from the oppression of our people. Since every academic institution sits on indigenous land, that oppression was first corporeal; ultimately the institutions exist because indigenous peoples were first dispossessed. That oppression continued in a less tangible but no less destructive way with the establishment of academic disciplines that exploited indigenous peoples as their subjects of research in ways that reinforced  the superior position of EuroAmerican peoples while subjugating their subjects of study//” (Mihesuah and Wilson 2004). **Because of the role the academy occupies today we are not afforded the luxury of self-referential politics and indulgent theory. For us scholarship today has to be directed very specifically at refusing and interrupting colonialism. We have a first priority as debaters and scholars that are speaking on blood soaked, stolen land.  Sandy Grande notes that** “//centuries of ‘rhetorical imperialism’ committed by ‘mainstream’ scholars pressures indigenous scholars to concentrate their research efforts on their own communities. In this context, restorative projects that affirm and sustain the value of indigenous languages, cultural knowledge, and intellectual history are a first priority. Against such immediate needs, engagement in abstract theory seems indulgent – a luxury and privilege of the academic elite. Further, theory itself is viewed as  definitively Eurocentric//” (Grande 2004, 2). **Churchill continues by saying that** “//if scholarship itself is to have any positive and constructive meaning. Scholarship is never neutral or objective, it always works either for the psychopath or against him, to mystify sociocultural reality or to decode it, to make corrective action possible or to prevent it//” (Churchill 1996, 15). **Our framework for this debate is that the ballot should represent who best advances the liberation of the oppressed. Our advocacy uses our privilege in this space to expose and confront the practices of colonialism from our social location. We apprehend and reject the logic of imperialism that thrives throughout these academic walls. This is what you vote for when you vote Aff. Neutrality is impossible, use the ballot to pierce the silence and confront the logic of colonialism. The status quo is a feast over candlelight, accompanied by lofty music and a fine wine outside a concentration camp.  A garden party next to a lynching.  Sandy Grande explains that the status quo politics undeniably serves the dominant culture as she writes that **“//postmodernism – the notion of fluid boundaries, the relativizing of difference and negation of grand narratives – primarily serves whitestream America. The multiphrenia of postmodern plurality, its world of simulation and obliteration of any sense of objective reality, has given rise to a freetic search for the authentic led by culture vultures and capitalist bandits fraught with imperialist nostalgia… the notion of fluidity has never worked to the advantage of indigenous peoples. Federal agencies have invoked the language of lfuid or unstable identities as the rationale for dismantling the structures of tribal life. Whitestream America has seized upon the message of relativism to declare open season on Indians, and whitestream academics have employed the language of signification and simulation to transmute centuries of war between indigenous peoples and their respective nation-states into a geneteic and cultural dialogue//” (Grande 2004, 112). **The status quo claims it is not the same form of theory that has denied success for native peoples in the past. Its proponents are, of course, guilt free, devoid of any responsibility. One must be skeptical of this defense due to its widespread prevalence throughout our society that has essentially created the silent sin of this nation. There are no perpetrators, only victims. Our argument is not a witch hunt, but we do ask that the status quo be held accountable for its existence in this colonial space. As colonial subjects it is our ethical responsibility to not fall into a fear of confronting others and questioning their efficacy in this time. Grande continues by writing that** “//it is equally important to avoid falling into the postmodern trap of relativism. A postmodern theory of difference that insists on impartiality masks the power and privilege that underpins whitestream culture and perspectives. In other words, American Indian students do not enter into a social space in which identities compete with equal power for legitimacy; rather, they are infused into a political terrain that presumes their inferiority. For example, postmodern musings of subjectivity as disembodied and free-floating ignore the fact that America Indian students…are engaged with the state in a complex relationship in which there are varying degrees of interdependence at play. As such American Indian students are neither free to reinvent themselves nor able to liberally transgress borders of difference, but rather, remain captive to the determined spaces of colonialist rule…Thus, while postmodern theorists rightly question the whole notion of origins and work to disrupt the grand narrative of modernism, its hyperelastic and all-inclusive categories offer little to no protection against the colonialist forces of cultural encroachment and capitalist commodification//” (Grande 2004, 113). **Our argument is simple, we are compelled by the contemporary state of affairs to respond to the imperialism of the status quo and the past five hundred years of occupation on this land.  We speak on stolen land so this is our primary responsibility.  Refusing this can only act to ignore the plight of native peoples, it insufferably casts aside any praxis that could be helpful to our struggle. **

To endlessly challenge forth knowledge is to enframe everything in the Standing Reserve – The will to reveal an objective picture of reality is coterminous with the selfish “rational utilitarian subject” of modern technology that accumulates and stockpiles energy from the sun – relating to the earth through security, mastery, and total knowing enframes everything in the instrumental mania of the standing reserve – this creates an ongoing logic of concentration camps and destruction of the earth in error replication.

The resolution has an accursed share: the Heterogeneous “other” energy of inner experience that is in excess of our ability to utilize or know it – sacrifice and utilization trade off with each other as ways to deal with this inevitable excess ~-~-- when we give up trying to utilize and accumulate the whole topic then we can adopt a sacrificial deployment of excess – unknowable and useless “other” energy is always a part of, but is also a transgression against, the Homogeneous energy of accumulation, utility, and self-security in the standing reserve – learning to accept the unknowability of accursed share forms an alternative to restricted expenditure because we stop struggling to stockpile excess energy and knowledge for the future use of autonomous subjects

This makes clear, I think, a weakness in Heidegger’s argument. While his

There’s Utility DA to excluding the accursed share – Sustainability and accumulation are the same: based on this exclusion, they are both forms of BAD expenditure of energy – they take turns propping up a consumer-capitalist restricted economy that is hell-bent on stockpiling and then wasting the earth in the standing reserve – they both assume and require coherent subjects acting in rational self-interest to somehow manage “their” resources in the name of mastery, security, survival and comfort – instead of accepting this vision, we need to affirm the other side of the topic – the inner experience of non-knowledge – affirm the unknown “other” energy that defies mastery through analysis – this kind of intimate communication about the topic is always left out by the attempt to accumulate knowledge and utility – the ethics formed by affirming the accursed share of non-knowledge is the only way to spare the earth from nuclear destruction
Stoekl ‘7 (Allan Stoekl, “Bataille’s Peak Energy, Religion, and Postsustainability,” p. 138-143, 2007) m leap

The fact that we could end up saving earth from extinction is an issue of secondary relevance to us, not a justification for voting aff – voting aff could end up sparing the earth but only because we give up trying to secure and know everything about the future, which disrupts the stability of the individualist restrained economy – our ethics of general expenditure entails an ecstatic frenzied revolt –eroticism and radical generosity as their own immediate justification – we affirm excess and madness, the intimate underside of human knowing and subjectivity that gets left out of by an exclusive focus on knowing reality

The topic is not reducible to a thing – we can trace it with our knowledge but we cannot stand outside it and describe and reveal it like a picture on the wall – the archival drive to accumulate and preserve objects of knowledge only succeeds in destroying the whole experience by trying to view the topic as a thing and thus reifying and quantifying any sense of play or animality in the resolution – the Archive destroys its contents by trying to accumulate and preserving them – it annihilates the accursed share by trying to catalogue it – attempting to aesthetically encounter the topic forms a better ecological politics than aesthetic representation and accumulation – we should yield to the unthinkable which disrupts the archival drive and allows us to question the creation of a taxonomy of things

the slave is rendered as the foundation of the national order but is also structurally unthought by it – however, the negative’s attempt to narrativize and present a solution to the position of the slave only collapses back into and re-elaborating the failures of leftist integration and multiculturalism – recognizing the position that ‘the unthought’ takes within the subject/object system of accumulation is a pre-requisite to having a good method – we affirm that which is unthought by the accumulation of the resolution – affirmation as an impossibility, a catastrophe and a wound that cannot be closed – only our role of the ballot articulates the narrative of our defeat without turning it into an obscene opportunity for celebration and progress – we cannot simply carve a space outside of the state for autonomous action – the fungible accumulation of the black body disarticulates the notion of consent – negating the resolution participates in the will of the master just the same as affirming it does, because the privilege of non-consensual subjectivity is first predicated on a negation of the black body’s will—this turns their second Gordon card

We claim mystic sovereignty when we accept the sacrificial knowledge of vulnerability, contingency, and penetration by death – the mystic speaks of death from within death – we are the executioner of the utilitarian reality, introducing the toxin of the impossible in order to collapse systems of meaning – a moment of ungluing and intoxication – Mysticism unmasks the anguish of the underside of experience that is concealed by rationally coordinated political science and philosophy.

Deleuze and Guattari ’72 (Gilles and Felix, Anti-Oedipus, 1972, p. 107-109)

Coextensiveness is another matter … than the parent-child relations.&amp;#34;49


Our lives exist perpetually in the middle – subjects in the middle of becoming objects – people in the middle living – people in the middle of becoming corpses.  Life is an a-subjective current of folded consciousness, a stream of life, and we slip on and on through the middle of it – never seeing the forest for the trees.   The truth is that the river runs through us too – united in pure immanence.  However, the restrictive identity of “self” survival imprisons us in the ego and the body, preventing any lines of flight or becoming.

Mark ’98 (John, Gilles Deleuze: Vitalism and Multiplicity, p. 29-33)

It&amp;#39;s organisms that …revolutions take shape. (N,45) 



Things Fall Apart: The force of entropy makes all physical existence fatal. Eventually even time will die. The supreme evil in this existence is the atomized ego because it prevents radical creativity and formlessness—the process of giving value to existence. We need to contemplate and embrace mass death in order to understand our own role in the process of dying. Only when the disaster speaks through us can we truly live our death and thus give meaning to the fundamental character of our existence. 1% chance that we can become the beauty of existence will always outweigh.

The affirmative approaches the world with the tautological rationality of viviocentrism – that is life-centeredness.  Viviocentrism is a noble lie that informs all aspects of their advocacy and it is the same binary logic of natural mastery that justifies racism, sexism, anthropomorphism, etc. Opening our minds to death allows a transcendence of the tyranny of life and creates the conditions for the ultimate erosion of all borders and conceptions of the natural – put the burden on them to justify physical existence as a roll for the ballot
