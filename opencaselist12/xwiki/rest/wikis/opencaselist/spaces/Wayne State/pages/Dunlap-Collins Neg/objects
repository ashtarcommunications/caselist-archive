Accounting for Atmosphere: The Anthropology of Climate Change is a project with the objective of building collaborative project appropriate to the challenge of understanding something as complex as climate change.

Robin Attfield, Professor of Philosophy at Cardiff University, &amp;#34;The Ethics of the Global Environment&amp;#34;, Perdue University Press, 1999, pg 68&#xD;

Nevertheless, as John Leslie has remarked, many philosophers write as if there were &#xD;

&#xD;
====Taxes don~’t violate rights====&#xD;

Also, as Kearl has pointed out, persons who gain entitlements through embedded labor &#xD;
AND&#xD;
is from the increased efficiencies of the market mechanism, not increased labor.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
====Illegitimate resource acquisition justifies redistribution====&#xD;
Will Kymlicka, Professor of Philosophy, University of Toronto, CONTEMPORARY POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY, 1990, p 109. &#xD;
Because most initial acquisition was in fact illegitimate, Nozick~’s theory cannot protect existing holdings &#xD;
AND&#xD;
people~’s claim to equal consideration, then Nozick~’s right of transfer never starts.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
====Redistribution is not slavery====&#xD;
Will Kymlicka, Professor of Philosophy, University of Toronto CONTEMPORARY POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY, 1990, p. 122-3.&#xD;
Finally, Nozick might argue that welfare redistribution denies people~’s dignity, and this dignity &#xD;
AND&#xD;
serve to promote, rather than attack, people~’s sense of equal dignity.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
====Extinction outweighs====&#xD;
Murray Rothbard, libertarian, Dean of Austrian School, Head of Mises Institute, FOR A NEW LIBERTY: THE LIBERTARIAN MANIFESTO, 1973, p. [[http://www.mises.org/rothbard/newlibertywhole.asp~~%23p263-http://www.mises.org/rothbard/newlibertywhole.asp]]. accessed 4/20/06.&#xD;

capitalism, liberalism, or libertarianism—would be of no importance whatsoever.&#xD;
