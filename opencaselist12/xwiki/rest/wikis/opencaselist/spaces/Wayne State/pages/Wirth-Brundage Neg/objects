Dictionary of American politics, 2nd edition, 1968. 
Federal government: in the united states: the government which, from its capital in the district of Columbia, directly legislates, administers, and exercises jurisdiction over matters assigned to it in the constitution and exerts considerable influence, by means of grants-in-aid and otherwise, over matters reserved to the state  governments.    

B.  Violation – The aff does not defend the federal government acting.
C.  Reasons to prefer - 
1. predictable limits – we are prepared to debate the USFG acting – allowing individual actions or independent criticisms of status quo policies justifies an infinite amount of aff cases.  
2. predictable ground – USFG action is key to stable research base. 
3. fairness – allowing the affirmative to stand here and negate a policy makes it impossible for the neg to garner offense in the 1nc.
4 Extra Topicality – Even if they claim to “defend” their plan – they skirt discussion of its merits by arguing the benefits derived from their advocacy outweigh. This is a voting issue because we’re forced to win framework just to get back to equal footing – extra topicality also proves the resolution insufficient and explodes aff ground.

As America recovers from economic recession, rural Americans are leading the way and USDA is supporting their efforts. It’s not time to let up now, and that’s why we need Congress to pass a Food, Farm and Jobs Bill as soon as possible.

Uniqueness Wall

The farm bill will pass in the lame duck but political capital is key – our evidence cites multiple people in Congress who say they will push the bill in the lame duck session. That’s Stiers and BMO.

The Northern Marianas could see a $33 million food stamp increase, if Republican Majority Leader Eric Cantor brings the long-delayed “Farm Bill” to a vote in the U.S. House of Representatives during the post-election lame duck session of Congress. Cantor, appearing at a Boise, Idaho campaign event for Republican Representative Raul Labrador this week, made the commitment to get the Farm Bill onto the floor of the House for a vote after November 6. “Mr. Cantor’s announcement is good news for the Northern Marianas,” said Congressman Gregorio Kilili Camacho Sablan.
