===Observation 1 is the status quo – ===&#xD;
&#xD;
====Federal fracking regulations are overlapping, impose unnecessary costs and stifle investment causing skyrocketing gas prices and decreased production – Specifically:====&#xD;

The American energy policy landscape is undergoing a revolution.1 The production of natural &#xD;
AND&#xD;
gas production in some parts of the United States and the world.7&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
===Thus, the plan:===&#xD;
&#xD;
====The United States federal government should substantially reduce restrictions on natural gas production in the United States by ceasing enforcement of the New Source Performance Standards and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants Reviews. The United States federal government should issue a moratorium on further federal restrictions on natural gas production in the United States.====&#xD;
&#xD;

===Advantage 1 is leadership===&#xD;

&#xD;
Something is badly needed to get the economy moving again and avoid another slowdown. &#xD;
AND&#xD;
gas windfall is very good news. Let~’s make the most of it.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
====Second —- price spikes will hurt consumers and cause recession====&#xD;
**LAMMEY 7** ~~[Alan, Energy Market Analyst @ Energy Intelligence Group, &amp;#34;High Oil, Gas Prices that Cause Recession Often Crushed in Turn&amp;#34; Natural Gas Week, April 2 — LEXIS~~]&#xD;

The first consideration has to do with the sheer gravity of the situation. What &#xD;
AND&#xD;
ruckus that Tea Party and Republican opposition could create over the next year.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
====Best studies prove growth solves conflict====&#xD;

Second, on a dyadic level. Copeland~’s (1996. 2000) theory of &#xD;
AND&#xD;
popularity, are statistically linked to an increase in the use of force.&#xD;

&#xD;
Furthermore, as President Obama touts the benefits of natural gas, his administration has &#xD;
AND&#xD;
responsible regulation of hydraulic fracturing, natural gas will certainly power America~’s future.&#xD;

Certainty key to development of shale gas&#xD;

To tap this benefit, it will be essential for the United States to promote &#xD;

supplies and to the long-term national interests of the United States.&#xD;

&#xD;
B. Federal v. State: Why &amp;#34;Spotty&amp;#34; Regulation is Better Regulation&#xD;
 &#xD;
 The push for more federal control of hydraulic fracturing seems at least partly motivated &#xD;
AND&#xD;
States has been &amp;#34;spotty&amp;#34; n199 may actually be a good thing.&#xD;
1. Regional differences&#xD;
In many respects, the more local and specialized the regulation, the better. &#xD;
AND&#xD;
road national standard could send the message that stricter requirements are unnecessary. n224&#xD;
2. Federal regulatory failures&#xD;
Obviously, only a shortsighted system would fail to account for at least some regional &#xD;
AND&#xD;
-centric system that has worked with relatively few problems for six decades.&#xD;
C. Financial Costs of Federal Regulation&#xD;
Even if fracking regulators were somehow immune from the failures that have plagued other agencies&#xD;
AND&#xD;
along to consumers, compounding government waste with higher prices at the pump.&#xD;
V. Conclusion&#xD;
The tremendous economic impact of hydraulic fracturing should not be understated. As the need &#xD;
AND&#xD;
little to gain, the costs of additional federal controls are simply unjustifiable.&#xD;
