THE OPPRESSION OF WOMEN AND RELEGATION OF REPRODUCTION TO THE PRIVATE SPHERE ARE NOT AHISTORICAL PRODUCTS OF SEXISM OR PATRIARCHY, BUT RATHER ARE HISTORICAL PRODUCTIONS OF THE EMERGENCE OF A CLASSED SOCIETY FOUNDED ON THE LOGIC OF SURPLUS ACCUMULATION.

THIS IS NOT THE ALTERNATIVE, BUT IN TRUTH THE ONLY OPTION— METHOD IS THE FOREMOST POLITICAL QUESTION BECAUSE ONE MUST UNDERSTAND THE EXISTING SOCIAL TOTALITY BEFORE ONE CAN ACT ON IT—GROUNDING THE SITES OF POLITICAL CONTESTATION OR KNOWLEDGE OUTSIDE OF LABOR AND SURPLUS VALUE MERELY SERVE TO HUMANIZE CAPITAL AND PREVENT A TRANSITION TO A SOCIETY BEYOND OPPRESSION
