Des Moines Register 2012 8/15 Wind credit likely to stay
All the huff and puff on the campaign trail in Iowa aside, it’s likely 
AND
credit won’t happen before the election, aides for Iowa’s congressional delegation said.
This Renewal Will Be Another Short-Term Extension of the PTC – Short-Term Extensions Create Uncertain Markets That Stifles the Industry – 5 Reasons

without forcing a newer, tougher Glass-Steagall law on the banks.

Wind Spills Over to Other Parts of the Economy
Philip Warburg Environmental Lawyer and president of the Conservation Law Foundation 2012 Harvest the Wind: America’s Journey to Jobs, Energy Independence, and Climate Stability Beacon Press, Boston Pg95
Under the 20% Wind Energy by 2030 scenario, manufacturing jobs directly related to 
AND
new, skill-based jobs – isn’t this a path worth taking?

A Permanent Extension is Key to Create Investor Certainty in the Longterm
Huffington Post 7/6 (12, “Investment will follow If congress renews PTC” http://www.thecleanenergyexchange.org/posts/view/investment-will-follow-if-congress-renews-ptc/d709khtkaw/)
This tax credit has been wildly successful, helping to fuel 400 wind manufacturing facilities 
AND
growth and to assure our global leadership in a rapidly emerging new sector.
Production Tax Credit key – Failure to Extend it Tanks the Industry
Matthews 12 (Richards, 3/7, Global Warming is Real, “Why Congress Must Extend the PTC for Wind Power”, http://globalwarmingisreal.com/2012/03/07/why-congress-must-extend-the-ptc-for-wind-power/)

Increased Potential for Global Conflict
Of course, the report encompasses more than economics and indeed believes the future is 
AND
within and between states in a more dog-eat-dog world. 

Advantage 2 is Energy Leadership

Energy leadership low – Obama is perceived as a nationalist on energy because of dirty energy production
Klare Professor of Peace and World Security Studies at Hampshire College 6-21-12 (Michael, “Is Barack Obama Morphing Into Dick Cheney?” http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/06/barack-obama-energy-dick-cheney, Mike)

Warming is conclusively real and anthropogenic – acting now key to mitigate weather-disasters
Beinecke President of the Natural Resources Defense Council 8-1-12 (Frances, “Connecting the Dots on Climate Change,” http://www.huffingtonpost.com/frances-beinecke/connecting-the-dots-on-cl_b_1728809.html, Mike)
On Wednesday, the Senate Environment and Public Works committee takes up the important issue

US Leadership on Clean Energy is Key to Establishing That Relationship
by Deborah Seligsohn on December 16, 2011 China At Durban: First Steps Toward A New Climate Agreement http://insights.wri.org/news/2011/12/china-durban-first-steps-toward-new-climate-agreement
It seems the coverage thus far has overlooked one development: the relationships that emerged 
AND
domestic purposes, but the international context will be less of a motivation.

 
Relations prevents extinction – it is the only way to solve economic stability, terrorism, crime, prolif, and disease spread.
Wenzhong, PRC Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 2-7-2K4 (Zhou, “Vigorously Pushing Forward the Constructive and Cooperative Relationship Between China and the United States,” http://china-japan21.org/eng/zxxx/t64286.htm)

We begin with a discussion of the possible weaknesses inherent in more consumption-oriented 
AND
institutional actors—socially regressive and environmentally ineffectual outcomes will be the result.
The alternative fails—idealism cannot save the environment, only specific reforms.
Martin Lewis, 1994. Lecturer in history and director of the International Relations program at Stanford. Green Delusions, p. 12-3, Google Books.
It is certainly not my belief that ideas are insignificant or that attempting to change 
AND
creation of an ecologically sustainable society becomes little more than an impossible dream.

Critiquing technological advances are regressive and doom the environment to catastrophe – it’s impossible to solve environmental problems without applying tech and instrumental rationality
Stephen Eric Bronner, Professor of Political Science at Rutgers University, 2004, Reclaiming the Enlightenment: Toward a Politics of Radical Engagement, p. 160

Critics of the Enlightenment may have correctly emphasized the price of progress, the costs 
AND
transcend the crude cate¬gories of technical criteria and slide-rule measurements.”7

Environmental solutions must be sustainable—ignoring human needs means there will be an inevitable backlash that dismantles the alternative.
Daniel Farber, 1999. Professor of Law at the University of Minnesota. Eco-Pragmatism, Pg. 12-3.
The ultimate challenge for environmental law is social sustainability.  It will do little good 
AND
a few years.  Environmental protection is a marathon, not a sprint.

Floating PICs bad
1. No Solvency Advocate – no literature basis for doing the aff without its justifications. 2. Kills Aff ground – 
a.	forces us to debate ourselves and makes it impossible to generate offense 
b.	Limiting aff ground to reps good is bad ground –justifies severing our reps

3. Kills education – only a risk that the PIC distracts from the substance of the critical lit because it oversimplifies the thesis of their lit base – means running the k without the PIC solves your education offense  

Consumption-only focus fails, it ignores production-oriented environmental degradation
Holmes 7 (Dave, “A socialist view of global warming: change the system, not the climate!”, Google Books, accessed: 6/26/12)
Such views among genuine environmental activists reflect a well-meaning but ultimately utopian belief 
AND
 society: what might be called the global ‘treadmill of production’.” 

The world of the alternative would be comparatively worse—returning to nature would put too much pressure on the environment, hastening extinction.
