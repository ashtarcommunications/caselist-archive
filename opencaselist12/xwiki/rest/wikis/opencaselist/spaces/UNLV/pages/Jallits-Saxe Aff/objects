PTC is Key to Energy Leadership

The world is in the midst of an energy revolution. Due to rising fossil fuel prices, the instability of oil rich regions, and the increasing dangers of global climate change, communities all over the planet are looking for new, modern, sustainable sources of energy. The United States should lead the way in investment and innovation that will pay dividends both economically and environmentally for decades to come by extending the PTC.

Permanent extension of PTC Is necessary to be viewed as a clean energy leader
Erin Dewey, 5- ’11 (“SUNDOWN AND YOU BETTER TAKE CARE: WHY SUNSET PROVISIONS HARM THE RENEWABLE ENERGY INDUSTRY AND VIOLATE TAX PRINCIPLES”, 52 B.C. L. Rev 1105)

    Our Aff is not the type of consumption they criticize- Wind panels don’t consume anything rather are just a transfer energy into a different form

    5. Perm: Do the plan and all parts of alt that don’t reject the AFF

Our Robertson evidence is much better than any impact they have – tech friendly counterculture like our affirmative has been able to solve for the problems of the K. this proves as uniqueness for how we have solved the problems of consumption with civilization. Robertson also said we can redefine civilization which is exactly what our permutation is talking about
6. Environmental management and tech are key to prevent extinction-there is no more “natural” state to retreat to.

History demonstrates the resilience of capitalism and the inevitability of growth despite periodic recessions and government intervention

The dumb, willfully blind optimists who dominated the late boom have been evicted—
AND
of American history have shown that it can be a pretty good guide.

Impact

    Extinction in the short term matters—Tickell evidence says warming will conclusively lead to extinction—Greenpeace says we have till 2020 to stop climate change, that gives us 80 years for policy makers to come up with a solution to the collapse of civilization
    2. Extend Issac—A consideration of political consequences is key—To not means we’re failing our responsibility as policy makers

Alternative

    Permutation—do the plan and reject civilization.
    2. Permutation—do the plan as a means of positive resistance.
    3. The alternative is self-rupturing and results in a vacuum of human nihilism that destroys value to life—civilization is not only inevitable, but even the most radical authors wouldn’t follow their path—Perm resolves this

    B. Spill over to other nations
    They have to win both of these things to win their Alt solves the links—We have evidence that says the plan is molded internationally

        The ultimate challenge for environmental law is social sustainability.  It will do little good

14. They Should Specify the Agent of the Alternative – That’s a Voting Issue

First, our Solvency Arguments against the alternative are -there is a distinction in the literature between attitudinal change based on social location- means they have utopian fiat because they can make significant structural barriers to transformation disappear–alt will solve every case by the 2nr

Second, is ground –we are forced to impact turn which they will say don’t apply or we have to link turn the criticism the AFF barely wins on
