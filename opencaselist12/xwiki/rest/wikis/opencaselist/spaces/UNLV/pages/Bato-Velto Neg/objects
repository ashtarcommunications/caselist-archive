Obama win key to US-Russia relations – Romney’s agenda is belligerent and controversial.
Reichardt 7/9. (Adam is the Managing Editor of New Eastern Europe, “Considering Russia in the Voting Booth,” New Eastern Europe, 2012, http://www.neweasterneurope.eu/node/382)

Obama’s policy towards Russia is easier to gauge, since there has already been four years of his administration to judge. As Ross Wilson noted, “President Obama has a four-year record with Russia to defend – i.e., the reset policy and the benefits that the administration will argue have accrued from its more pragmatic and less confrontational approach to relations with Moscow.”
President Obama’s policy of reset was indeed a glimmer of hope for US-Russian relations at the start of 2009, but that glimmer has all but faded. The case of Syria and Iran are clear examples of the real challenges America still faces when engaging with Russia on global issues and the Obama campaign will most likely avoid referring to the “reset” by name.
“Though the Administration will not use the expression ‘reset’ too much, it can be expected to continue to emphasize pragmatism and to implement that line if the president is re-elected,” Wilson believes.
Obama’s opponent, Mitt Romney, has been less clear about his position on relations 
AND
no Cold War, but Russia is a geopolitical foe in that regard.&amp;#34;
The Romney campaign’s web site reveals several areas of focus for Russia, none of them discuss active engagement, but rather focus on taking tougher stances with Russia, including renegotiating the New Start Treaty, decreasing Europe’s energy reliance on Russia, building stronger relations with Central Asia, as well as supporting Russia’s civil society. 
Surprisingly, the last one, engaging Russia’s civil society, could be the most 
AND
in the opposition – it could hurt the entire goal of this platform.
Having the American government play an active role in the changes happening inside Russia could be detrimental to US-Russian relations. Many Russians believe that changes within their own country should be driven from the Russian society. Any outside interference would hurt the legitimacy of the Russian opposition and cause the Russian elite to become even more suspicious, and perhaps even hostile, to the intentions of American foreign policy.

Plan can’t solve the economy 
Post, 11 (Willem, SME New Jersey Institute of Technology, MSME Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, MBA, University of Connecticut. P.E. Connecticut. Consulting Engineer and Project Manager, “Wind Energy Does Little to Reduce CO2 Emissions”, 9/8/11, http://theenergycollective.com/node/64492) WP
Within federal, state and local governments tens of thousands of people are busying themselves promoting renewables by with holding meetings and public hearings, preparing studies, writing reports, energy plans, laws, rules and regulations, monitoring projects for compliance, etc.¶ Outside of government wind turbine vendors (Siemens, GE, Vestas, Iberdrola, etc,), project developers/owners, financiers managing tax shelters, trade organizations, etc., are busying themselves popularizing wind energy as saving the planet from global warming with PR campaigns that claim there would be significant reductions of fossil fuel consumption and CO2 reductions/kWh, that capital costs/MW would decrease, and that wind energy costs/kWh would be at grid parity in the near future. These claims have largely not been realized. ¶ Global Warming is a Given: A just-released report from EIA shows the actual world energy consumption data and projected consumption data for the 1990 to 2035 period. The report shows world energy consumption is estimated to increase from 505 quads in 2008 to 770 quads in 2035, a 52% increase. The biggest part of the increase is by (non-OECD nations + Asia).¶ http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/ieo/world.cfm¶ See spreadsheet associated with figure 12¶ World energy consumption by fuel (quadrillion Btu) ¶ Liquids: From 173.2 in 2010 to 225.1 in 2035; 30% more¶ Natural gas: 116.7 to 174.7; 50% more¶ Coal: 149.4 to 209.1; 49% more¶ Nuclear: 27.6 to 51.2; 86% more¶ Renewables: 55.2 to 109.5; 98% more¶ Renewables fraction of total consumption: From 10.6% in 2010 to 15.2% in 2035¶ Fossil fraction of total consumption: 84.1% to 79.1%¶ The significant increase in projected fossil fuel consumption during the next 24 years means global warming will continue unabated, because (non-OECD + ASIA) will have energy consumption growth far outpacing the energy consumption growth of the rest of the world; i.e., global warming is a given. ¶ The above indicates the enormous investments required to achieve the 2035 projected renewables energy production would have practically no benefit regarding global warming.¶ This means policy makers should shift renewables subsidies to energy efficiency which will not only reduce CO2 without controversies, but will actually do some good for household and business energy bills and thereby raise their living standards and profits.¶ That would be the rational thing to do. However, using Greenspan&amp;#39;s words, the people, including legislators and bureaucrats, have become &amp;#34;irrationally exuberant&amp;#34; regarding renewables reducing global warming. The above shows, it is an expensive and futile tilting at wind mills a la Don Quixote.¶ Competitiveness: The above begs the question: If wind energy reduces CO2 by so very little/kWh, or not at all, or increases it, AND requires so much capital/MW to implement, AND produces energy at such a high cost/kWh, AND has such huge adverse impacts on quality of life (noise and infrasound, visuals, social unrest, psychological), property values and the environment, why are we, as a nation, making ourselves even less efficient relative to our competitors by this slavish, lemming-like pursuit of expensive wind energy?¶ Who Benefits: Could it be that the Wall Street elites see the 30% federal cash grants, accelerated write-offs, generous feed-in tariffs and renewable energy credits as major tax shelters and long-term income streams (preferably tax-free) for themselves and their high-income clients, all at the expense of the Main Street economy which is already economically depressed? ¶ If the amounts of the grants and taxes-not-collected due to these deductions from taxable incomes are totaled, it would be evident wind energy is very expensively subsidized indeed; not helpful for reducing budget deficits.¶ Roll more and more such expensive wind energy into rate schedules and the US will become even less competitive than at present: not helpful for reducing trade deficits. ¶ Wind energy promoters often use Denmark as the model to emulate. However, Denmark is in the unique position of having a large capacity of hydro plants of Norway and Sweden available for balancing wind energy; i.e., other grids with little or no hydro plants cannot use Denmark as a model. This unique position has been unfortunate for Danish households, because their electric rates are the highest in Europe; France, 80% nuclear, has the lowest.

One final point of potential concern is that MLPs have typically been used to finance

Companies won’t use MLPs – too complex.

The first disadvantage of the MLP structure is its structural complexity. Common units,

A second disadvantage of MLPs is their relatively limited ability to accumulate cash. As noted above, MLPs contractually obligate themselves to distribute 100% of their available cash each quarter. As a result, MLPs cannot build up war chests like traditional corporations and are therefore highly dependent upon external sources of financing to fund their growth projects and acquisitions.

2NC Cant Solve Global Emissions
Cant Offset Global CO2 Emissions
Post, 11 (Willem, SME New Jersey Institute of Technology, MSME Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, MBA, University of Connecticut. P.E. Connecticut. Consulting Engineer and Project Manager, “Wind Energy Does Little to Reduce CO2 Emissions”, 9/8/11, http://theenergycollective.com/node/64492) WP
Within federal, state and local governments tens of thousands of people are busying themselves promoting renewables by with holding meetings and public hearings, preparing studies, writing reports, energy plans, laws, rules and regulations, monitoring projects for compliance, etc.¶ Outside of government wind turbine vendors (Siemens, GE, Vestas, Iberdrola, etc,), project developers/owners, financiers managing tax shelters, trade organizations, etc., are busying themselves popularizing wind energy as saving the planet from global warming with PR campaigns that claim there would be significant reductions of fossil fuel consumption and CO2 reductions/kWh, that capital costs/MW would decrease, and that wind energy costs/kWh would be at grid parity in the near future. These claims have largely not been realized. ¶ Global Warming is a Given: A just-released report from EIA shows the actual world energy consumption data and projected consumption data for the 1990 to 2035 period. The report shows world energy consumption is estimated to increase from 505 quads in 2008 to 770 quads in 2035, a 52% increase. The biggest part of the increase is by (non-OECD nations + Asia).¶ http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/ieo/world.cfm¶ See spreadsheet associated with figure 12¶ World energy consumption by fuel (quadrillion Btu) ¶ Liquids: From 173.2 in 2010 to 225.1 in 2035; 30% more¶ Natural gas: 116.7 to 174.7; 50% more¶ Coal: 149.4 to 209.1; 49% more¶ Nuclear: 27.6 to 51.2; 86% more¶ Renewables: 55.2 to 109.5; 98% more¶ Renewables fraction of total consumption: From 10.6% in 2010 to 15.2% in 2035¶ Fossil fraction of total consumption: 84.1% to 79.1%¶ The significant increase in projected fossil fuel consumption during the next 24 years means global warming will continue unabated, because (non-OECD + ASIA) will have energy consumption growth far outpacing the energy consumption growth of the rest of the world; i.e., global warming is a given. ¶ The above indicates the enormous investments required to achieve the 2035 projected renewables energy production would have practically no benefit regarding global warming.¶ This means policy makers should shift renewables subsidies to energy efficiency which will not only reduce CO2 without controversies, but will actually do some good for household and business energy bills and thereby raise their living standards and profits.¶ That would be the rational thing to do. However, using Greenspan&amp;#39;s words, the people, including legislators and bureaucrats, have become &amp;#34;irrationally exuberant&amp;#34; regarding renewables reducing global warming. The above shows, it is an expensive and futile tilting at wind mills a la Don Quixote.¶

Reichardt 7/9. (Adam is the Managing Editor of New Eastern Europe, “Considering Russia in the Voting Booth,” New Eastern Europe, 2012, http://www.neweasterneurope.eu/node/382)

Obama’s policy towards Russia is easier to gauge, since there has already been four years of his administration to judge. As Ross Wilson noted, “President Obama has a four-year record with Russia to defend – i.e., the reset policy and the benefits that the administration will argue have accrued from its more pragmatic and less confrontational approach to relations with Moscow.”
President Obama’s policy of reset was indeed a glimmer of hope for US-Russian relations at the start of 2009, but that glimmer has all but faded. The case of Syria and Iran are clear examples of the real challenges America still faces when engaging with Russia on global issues and the Obama campaign will most likely avoid referring to the “reset” by name.
“Though the Administration will not use the expression ‘reset’ too much, it can be expected to continue to emphasize pragmatism and to implement that line if the president is re-elected,” Wilson believes.
Obama’s opponent, Mitt Romney, has been less clear about his position on relations 
AND
no Cold War, but Russia is a geopolitical foe in that regard.&amp;#34;
The Romney campaign’s web site reveals several areas of focus for Russia, none of them discuss active engagement, but rather focus on taking tougher stances with Russia, including renegotiating the New Start Treaty, decreasing Europe’s energy reliance on Russia, building stronger relations with Central Asia, as well as supporting Russia’s civil society.

Having the American government play an active role in the changes happening inside Russia could be detrimental to US-Russian relations. Many Russians believe that changes within their own country should be driven from the Russian society. Any outside interference would hurt the legitimacy of the Russian opposition and cause the Russian elite to become even more suspicious, and perhaps even hostile, to the intentions of American foreign policy.

A2: Perm Do Both
1. Hold them to the text of the permutation in the 2AC – 1AR clarifications of what this means are sandbagging and a voting issue because we don’t get to actually answer the substance of the argument until the 2NR
2. Prior and binding key – otherwise the public won’t participate and links to politics – means no solvency

Citizen opposition to transportation projects is often explained as being fueled by a fundamental sense

issue first and foremost lest the complete process loses all meaning and dignity.
 4. ZERO risk of a net benefit to the permutation – only a risk of NIMBY backlash – perm has to have a net benefit or theoretical justification to be legitimate otherwise the aff can make them endlessly without explanation or warrant – hypotesting died out in the 80’s

A2: Perm Do the CP

1. The perm is functional severance – the CP never mandates the plan happens – it’s a completely different action, ALL of which ALWAYS happens – reg-negs are not resolved because they allow invited parties to amend or nullify the affs reduction on regulations – that’s a voting issue for fairness and education because it destroys all neg ground
A2: Reg Neg Takes a Long Time
1. Reg Neg is comparatively faster – litigation issues with the environment alone take years to overcome – public backlash to the plan delays any of their internal links and not the CP because it engages the public at the beginning of the process – that’s Nolon
This means the CP happens faster than the aff***

Another criticism of traditional rulemaking is that it is slow and cumbersome. 14 Major rules require an average of three and one-half years for their creation and promulgation. 15 A subsequent court challenge, which EPA estimates to be an eighty-five percent possibility for each of its regulations, may delay the implementation of a rule even further. 16

Insert Reg-Neg Good block

Theory – CP Legitimate
Our interpretation – counterplans that recommend plan but don’t fiat passage are good – counterplans that contingently fiat passage are bad- solves their offense by eliminating CPs like consult and QPQ
Allowing Reg-Neg CPs is good- key to check a large topic with no unifying themes between the 6 energies and two mechanisms, key to access the lit base on rhetorical commitment versus material action, gives the aff built-in solvency deficit ground by saying the plan wouldn’t be implemented

2NC Overview

The disad outweighs and turns the case – 

A) Key timeframe distinction – link timeframe outweighs impact timeframe – the 1NC Hitchens evidence indicates that other nations will preempt US tech if they think the US is trying to pursue space dominance – means only the disad can turn the case

B) Magnitude – the Mitchell evidence indicates that space preemption would spill over to land wars – other nations would perceive the threat and attack with nuclear or biological weapons in the midst of crisis

C) Probability – Mitchell indicates that space warfare can be triggered by tech accidents and miscalculation – means intervening actors can’t check

Block Solvency Wall
The counterplan solves the entire case~-~--it has the Department of Energy alter the QTR expressing support for the mandates of the plan~-~--that non-binding agency guidance document shapes the public debate over future policy and alters budgets to fund the plan – that’s Tollefson
The result of the CP is indistinguishable from the plan~-~-- it signals that the DOE has embraced the end-point of the plan~-~--nobody will perceive a difference between the plan and the CP for the purpose of solvency and if they do, they’ll comply with the CP as though it were binding~-~--that’s Hunnicut. 
The QTR will shape future policies – it’s a guide to budget planners.

Connor N. Raso 10, J.D., Yale Law School, January 2010, “Note: Strategic or Sincere? Analyzing Agency Use of Guidance Documents,” The Yale Law Journal, 119 Yale L.J. 782, p. lexis 
Policy statements are intended to provide the public with a sense of an agency&amp;#39;s position 
AND
may have important policy implications if they alter the behavior of regulated parties.

Agencies are overwhelmingly likely to comply with the memo~-~--zero risk of their solvency deficits because the CP changes the calculus of the staff responsible for implementing the plan

A2: Perm – do the cp
Permuting to do the CP is severance~-~--the CP clearly doesn’t make binding law~-~--it’s a policy memo which expresses support for the concept of the plan, but in no way mandates it~-~--this distinction is legally significant and borne out in the way that agencies actually make policy~-~--that’s Koch. 
The CP doesn’t just PIC out of certainty~-~--there is zero world in which voting neg includes mandating that any part of the plan be done~-~--there is nothing in the CP that could reasonably constitute the plan~-~--it’s different than a CP that, for instance, conditioned the plan on the outcome of some review process~-~--our CP never contains the possibility of mandating the adoption of the plan~-~--means the perm has to be severance.

Ext. 1 – Prolif Slow
Extend Waltz – proliferation will be slow. Their authors are paranoid and continually over-state the risk. Since the 60s, they have claimed we were on the brink of a massive wave of proliferation, but there are still less than 10 countries with nukes and only a couple more are threatening
And, it will stay slow – 3 reasons 
First, Capability—
Iran proves it takes decades to develop an arsenal; new weapons don’t appear out of thin air
Fox 7 (Stuart, author for Scienceline, “Why is it taking Iran so long to make a nuclear weapons? Didn’t it only take the US four years to invent them?”)  http://scienceline.org/2007/11/20/ask-fox-nuclearbombs/
Iran and its nuclear program appears a great deal in the news these days, even with estimates that they are five to ten years away from completing a nuclear weapon. To understand why it’s taken Iran over 18 years to build a bomb, one needs to consider the steps it takes to build a bomb, and differences between the conditions in which Iran and the U.S. pursued this technology.
And, expenses – the sheer number of workers and materials means that developing weapons won’t be quick.
Fox 7 (Stuart, author for Scienceline, “Why is it taking Iran so long to make a nuclear weapons? Didn’t it only take the US four years to invent them?”)  http://scienceline.org/2007/11/20/ask-fox-nuclearbombs/
According to “The Making of the Atomic Bomb” by Richard Rhodes, to 
AND
week, took three years to produce enough properly enriched uranium for the bomb
Second, Motive – states don’t want instant recluse status
Elhefnawy 8 (Nader, B.A international relations, author books, “The Next Wave of Nuclear Proliferation”)  http://www.carlisle.army.mil/usawc/Parameters/08autumn/elhefnawy.pdf
Long-established research strongly indicates that the motivation to build nuclear weapons is more 
AND
little as $500 million, less than the price of a modern warship
Third, No Arms Race – nuclear weapons make force comparisons irrelevant
Waltz 95 (The Spread of Nuclear Weapons: A Debate, p. 29-30)
One may believe that old American and Soviet military doctrines set the pattern that new 
AND
ranges neither side need respond to increases in the other side’s military capabilities.
Ext. 2 – No Domino Effect
No nuclear domino effect—
a. It’s Slow—65 years since the invention of the bomb—Yet only 9 states have nukes
b. Disarm—South Africa, Belarus, and Kazakhstan all voluntarily disarmed at the same time other states were rearming, there’s no correlation 
c. Prefer it—History proves our argument
That’s All Bergenas 
And, proliferation pessimism is wrong—Loads of empirical data and historical records prove nuclear proliferation has a stabilizing effect 
Sechser 8 (Todd S. Sechser, University of Virginia 2008 CQ Press “No”164-174)

===Ext – Too Expensive===

====Solar power fail —- its too expensive and comparatively worse for energy production than other alternatives. ====
**Japan Times 3.** ~~Aug 14, &amp;#34;Alternative power is set to blow away the old&amp;#34; — lexis~~
Solar power, too, will have a key role in the new energy marketplace, and worldwide sales of solar cells are rising 30 percent annually, but Brown is most enthusiastic about wind. &amp;#34;Solar cells are still too costly to supply the vast amounts of energy required to power a modern economy. For energy investors, growth in the future lies with wind and the hydrogen produced with cheap wind-generated electricity,&amp;#34; he says.


====Solar power isn~’t even close to cost effective. ====
**Walker 4**. ~~Cameron, freelance writer on wildlife and conservation biology &amp;#34;The Future of Alternative Energy&amp;#34; National Geographic News Oct 28 — http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/10/1028_041028_alternative_energy.html-http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/10/1028_041028_alternative_energy.html~~ 
Technological improvements have made solar-electric modules more cost-effective. In the 1980s the average price of energy captured with photovoltaics was 95 U.S. cents per kilowatt-hour. Today that price has dropped to around 20 cents per kilowatt-hour, according to Collins, of the American Solar Energy Society. 
The cheaper rate is still more expensive than the average national price of electricity, which in 2003 was a little over 8 cents per kilowatt-hour, according to the U.S. Department of Energy~’s Annual Energy Review. 



====Solar power is comparatively the most expensive alternate energy source. ====

====Solar energy costs too much.====
**Business Times Singapore 8.** ~~&amp;#34;Managing energy, water resources&amp;#34; July 7 — lexis~~
The three to four decades of improvements in alternative energy have made wind, solar power and high-tech batteries attractive. A caveat, though, is cost. One reason why green power costs much more than fossil fuels stems from how existing forms of renewable energy rely on subsidies or other forms of special treatment for their viability.


====Renewable energy policies fail due to location obstacles. ====
**Wright 8.** ~~Stephen J. Wright Administrator, Bonneville Power Administration United States Department of Energy, CQ Congressional Testimony June 17 – lexis~~ 
It is important to remember that renewable electricity resources differ from coal, natural gas

If those technologies have economic merit, no subsidy is necessary. If they don~’t, then no subsidy will provide it. Let~’s look at each of those technologies in turn. 
Zero-emission coal-fired power plants are a figment of the imagination. As far as &amp;#34;clean coal&amp;#34; is concerned (which is not ~’zero-emission~’ by any means), it~’s been the recipient of lavish government subsidy for 20 years now without even one single commercially viable facility to show for our past efforts. Those plants are still too expensive to compete in the market and investors won~’t touch them.
Wind and solar power has been the recipient of 30 years worth of government largesse, yet neither has been able to gain any significant market share despite the handouts. Apparently, hope springs eternal.

Mitt Romney released his energy plan in New Mexico on Thursday, and while it appears short on detail, it follows a familiar pattern: more fossil fuels, less clean energy development. It~’s the same approach America relied on for a century. President Obama recognizes it is time for something new. Obama has presided over the largest increase in clean energy this nation has ever seen. Thanks to a combination of government policies and private sector gumption, roughly 35 percent of all new power built in the United States in the last four years came from wind. The solar industry is 10 times the size it was just a few years ago and employs more than 100,000 Americans. Obama has made history by raising fuel efficiency standards to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. By pushing cars to go farther on a tank of gas, these standards will save consumers %241.7 trillion at the pump. Automakers are already hiring workers to get these cars on the road. Labor unions and automakers estimate the new standards will generate 570,000 jobs across the economyhttp://www.bluegreenalliance.org/news/publications/gearing-up. And because the standards cut our oil imports by one-third, they represent the biggest step America has taken to confront climate change. The administration also set the first-ever limits on carbon pollution from new power plants-a move that will help America create a cleaner, 21st century power fleet and reduce the threat of global warming. These breakthroughs secure our nation~’s leadership of the 21st century global energy market. And they confirm the value of forward-looking innovation. Romney prefers to look to the past. He would dish out subsidies to mature oil and gas companies-some of the richest in the world-but starve clean energy innovators. Romney said he would kill the Production Tax Credit, the most effective incentive for wind energy and one that enjoys broad bipartisan support. The Ryan budget, meanwhile, would hand over %2440 billion in taxpayer dollars to oil companies at the same time it cuts clean energy investments 90 percent, down to just %241 billion.

There are multiple, rigorous technical and procedural safeguards to protect against accidental or unauthorized launch. These safeguards include positive measures such as weapon design features, safety rules, procedures (including two-man rule), accident prevention or mitigation measures, and other controls. Such controls include physical security and coded control systems, which are used collectively or individually to enhance safety and to reduce the likelihood, severity, or consequences of an accident, unauthorized actions, or deliberate destructive actions.

The more recent meltdown at the reactor in Chernobyl in 1986 reminded the world of the dangers of the atom. The incident was referred to as &amp;#34;nuclear genocide,&amp;#34; and the press wrote of &amp;#34;forests stained red&amp;#34; and of deformed insects. The public was bombarded with images of Soviet cleanup crews wearing protective suits, bald-headed children with cancer and the members of cement crews who lost their lives in an attempt to seal off the cracked reactor with a concrete plug. Fifteen years after the reactor accident, the German newsmagazine Focus concluded that Chernobyl was responsible for &amp;#34;500,000&amp;#34; deaths. Was all this just doomsday folklore? There is no doubt that large sections of the countryside were contaminated by the accident in the Ukraine. In the ensuing decades, up to 4,000 cleanup workers and residents of the more highly contaminated areas died of the long-term consequences of radiation exposure. But the six-figure death counts that opponents of nuclear power once cited are simply nonsense. In most cases, they were derived from vague &amp;#34;extrapolations&amp;#34; based on the hearsay reported by Russian dissidents. But such horror stories have remained part of the nuclear narrative to this day. In fact, contemporaries who reported on the Chernobyl incident should have known better. Even in the 1980s, radiobiologists and radiation physicists considered the media~’s doomsday reports to be exaggerated. And their suspicions have become a virtual certainty today. Groups of researchers have set up shop at all of the sites of nuclear accidents or major nuclear contamination. They work at Hanford (where the United States began producing plutonium in 1944), they conduct studies in the English town of Sellafield (where a contaminated cloud escaped from the chimney in 1957), and they study the fates of former East German uranium mineworkers in the states of Saxony and Thuringia. New mortality rates have now been compiled for all of these groups of individuals at risk. Surprisingly, the highest mortality rates were found among the East German mineworkers. In Hiroshima, on the other hand, radioactivity claimed surprisingly few human lives. Experts now know exactly what happened in the first hours, days and weeks after the devastating atomic explosion. Almost all of Hiroshima~’s 140,000 victims died quickly. Either they were crushed immediately by the shock wave, or they died within the next few days of acute burns. But the notorious radiation sickness — a gradual ailment that leads to certain death for anyone exposed to radiation levels of 6 Gray or higher — was rare. The reason is that Little Boy simply did not produce enough radioactivity. But what about the long-term consequences? Didn~’t the radiation work like a time bomb in the body? To answer these questions, the Japanese and the Americans launched a giant epidemiological study after the war. The study included all residents of Hiroshima and Nagasaki who had survived the atomic explosion within a 10-kilometer (6.2-mile) radius. Investigators questioned the residents to obtain their precise locations when the bomb exploded, and used this information to calculate a personal radiation dose for each resident. Data was collected for 86,572 people. Today, 60 years later, the study~’s results are clear. More than 700 people eventually died as a result of radiation received from the atomic attack: 87 died of leukemia; 440 died of tumors; and 250 died of radiation-induced heart attacks. In addition, 30 fetuses developed mental disabilities after they were born. Such statistics have attracted little notice so far. The numbers cited in schoolbooks are much higher. According to Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia, 105,000 people died of the &amp;#34;long-term consequences of radiation.&amp;#34; &amp;#34;For commendable reasons, many critics have greatly exaggerated the health risks of radioactivity,&amp;#34; says Albrecht Kellerer, a Munich radiation biologist. &amp;#34;But contrary to widespread opinion, the number of victims is by no means in the tens of thousands.&amp;#34; Especially surprising, though, is that the stories of birth defects in newborns are also pure fantasy. The press has repeatedly embellished photos of a destroyed Hiroshima with those of deformed children, children without eyes or with three arms. In reality, there hasn~’t been a single study that provides evidence of an elevated rate of birth defects. A final attempt to establish a connection is currently underway in Japan. The study includes 3,600 people who were unborn fetuses in their mothers~’ wombs on that horrific day in August 1945. But it too has failed to furnish any evidence of elevated chromosomal abnormality. In Germany, where nuclear fears have coalesced with the fear of dying forests and mad cow disease into a general psychosis of threat, the degree of concern over nuclear radiation remains high. To this day, some are so fearful about the long-term effects of fallout from Chernobyl that they refuse to eat mushrooms from Bavaria. Even 20 years ago such behavior would not have made sense.

Webster~’s Guide to Grammar and Writing, 2K (http://ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/marks/colon.htm-http://ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/marks/colon.htm)
Use of a colon before a list or an explanation that is preceded by a clause that can stand by itself. Think of the colon as a gate, inviting one to go on… If the introductory phrase preceding the colon is very brief and the clause following the colon represents the real business of the sentence, begin the clause after the colon with a capital letter.


====That excludes individual action====

====Policymakers will inevitably make predictions—the only question is whether they~’re based off of explicit or implicit threats. Failure to make predictions based off of explicit risk calculation guarantees poor decisionmaking.====
Fitzsimmons, 07  (Michael, defense analyst in Washington DC. &amp;#34;The Problem of Uncertainty in Strategic Planning&amp;#34;, Survival, Winter 06/07)

====Interpretation-====

====Restrictions are direct and legal====
**Law.com (&amp;#34;Restrict,&amp;#34; **http://dictionary.law.com/Default.aspx?selected=1835%26bold=restrict-http://dictionary.law.com/Default.aspx?selected=1835%26bold=restrict**)**
The noun ―restriction means direct, on-face limitation. restriction
n. any limitation on activity, by statute, regulation or contract provision. In multi-unit real estate developments, condominium and cooperative housing projects managed by homeowners~’ associations or similar organizations, such organizations are usually required by state law to impose restrictions on use. Thus, the restrictions are part of the &amp;#34;covenants, conditions and restrictions&amp;#34; intended to enhance the use of common facilities and property which are recorded and incorporated into the title of each owner.3

====&amp;#34;On&amp;#34; means directly targeted====
**World English Dictionary 2009** (http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/on?s=t)
— prep
1.	in contact or connection with the surface of; at the upper surface of: an apple on the ground ; a mark on the table cloth
2.	attached to: a puppet on a string
3.	carried with: I~’ve no money on me
4.	in the immediate vicinity of; close to or along the side of: a house on the sea ; this verges on the ridiculous%21
5.	within the time limits of a day or date: he arrived on Thursday
6.	being performed upon or relayed through the medium of: what~’s on the television?

====&amp;#34;Energy production&amp;#34; means electricity made from the energy====
**US Code 2012** (Title 42 › Chapter 149 › Subchapter XIII › § 16491, http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/16491)
42 USC § 16491 - Energy production incentives
(a) In general
A State may provide to any entity—
(1) a credit against any tax or fee owed to the State under a State law, or
(2) any other tax incentive,
determined by the State to be appropriate, in the amount calculated under and in accordance with a formula determined by the State, for production described in subsection (b) in the State by the entity that receives such credit or such incentive.
(b) Eligible entities
Subsection (a) shall apply with respect to the production in the State of electricity from coal mined in the State and used in a facility, if such production meets all applicable Federal and State laws and if such facility uses scrubbers or other forms of clean coal technology.
(c) Effect on interstate commerce
Any action taken by a State in accordance with this section with respect to a tax or fee payable, or incentive applicable, for any period beginning after August 8, 2005, shall—
(1) be considered to be a reasonable regulation of commerce; and
(2) not be considered to impose an undue burden on interstate commerce or to otherwise impair, restrain, or discriminate, against interstate commerce.

====Violation- the aff must remove a direct limitation on electricity production. The plan resolves a legal dispute about the content of a report written by the NRC- it does NOT in ANY WAY affect regulations on power plant operation- EVEN IF you think this somehow meets restriction, they~’re extra-topical because they affect storage facilities and not power plants====
**Briggs 2012** (Alexander T., Managing the Line Between Nuclear Power and Nuclear Terror: Considering the Threat of Terrorism as an Environmental Impact,  J.D. Candidate 2012, Seton Hall University School of Law; B.A. 2005, Pittsburg State University, 8 Seton Hall Cir. Rev. 223, lexis)
In 1974, Congress established the NRC to promote the civilian use of nuclear power 
AND
an EIS for a nuclear power plant or nuclear fuel storage facility. n22

====Reasons to vote====

====Limits- they allow affs to deal with any conceivable inconvenience at any point in the process of getting to energy production- could range from coal miner union wages to availability of nuclear sector construction workers- limiting to a set of direct legal restrictions on production is most predictable and least arbitrary====

====Ground- in order to get any links against restrictions affs they have to remove a law directly regulating production- that~’s the only way to get links to things like &amp;#34;X energy bad&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;natural gas tradeoff&amp;#34;- more conceptual &amp;#34;restrictions&amp;#34; remove all basis for link ground====

====Extra T- they affect nuclear fuel storage facilities- independent voting issue, allows access to solvency advocates and advantage ground that have nothing to do with producing energy and only about siting- justifies the &amp;#34;drill in ANWR and put it in the SPR&amp;#34; aff which would spike literally every generic with its second extra-T plank- just rejecting extra-t parts doesn~’t solve since our strategy was already skewed and forces us to win T just to get back to square one====

**Mobilizing the base key to the election**
**Reeve 6/12** (Elspeth, &amp;#34;Base Diving: Obama and Romney Both Have Enthusiasm Gaps&amp;#34;, Atlantic Wire, Jun 12, 2012, http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2012/06/base-diving-obama-and-romney-both-have-enthusiasm-gaps/53437/~~%23)//KR
Independents don~’t like Mitt Romney personally, and they don~’t think Obama has great ideas 
AND
the base, both candidates are struggling right now, for several reasons.

====Obama win is critical to clean energy transition – Romney will only support oil and gas.====
Taylor 8/23**/12** (Heather Taylor, director of the Natural Resources Defense Council~’s Action Fund, Innovation or More of the Same?, AUGUST 23, 2012, http://energy.nationaljournal.com/2012/08/sizing-up-romney-and-obama-ene.php)
Mitt Romney released his energy plan in New Mexico on Thursday, and while it appears short on detail, it follows a familiar pattern: more fossil fuels, less clean energy development. It~’s the same approach America relied on for a century. President Obama recognizes it is time for something new. Obama has presided over the largest increase in clean energy this nation has ever seen. Thanks to a combination of government policies and private sector gumption, roughly 35 percent of all new power built in the United States in the last four years came from wind. The solar industry is 10 times the size it was just a few years ago and employs more than 100,000 Americans. Obama has made history by raising fuel efficiency standards to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. By pushing cars to go farther on a tank of gas, these standards will save consumers %241.7 trillion at the pump. Automakers are already hiring workers to get these cars on the road. Labor unions and automakers estimate the new standards will generate 570,000 jobs across the economyhttp://www.bluegreenalliance.org/news/publications/gearing-up. And because the standards cut our oil imports by one-third, they represent the biggest step America has taken to confront climate change. The administration also set the first-ever limits on carbon pollution from new power plants-a move that will help America create a cleaner, 21st century power fleet and reduce the threat of global warming. These breakthroughs secure our nation~’s leadership of the 21st century global energy market. And they confirm the value of forward-looking innovation. Romney prefers to look to the past. He would dish out subsidies to mature oil and gas companies-some of the richest in the world-but starve clean energy innovators. Romney said he would kill the Production Tax Credit, the most effective incentive for wind energy and one that enjoys broad bipartisan support. The Ryan budget, meanwhile, would hand over %2440 billion in taxpayer dollars to oil companies at the same time it cuts clean energy investments 90 percent, down to just %241 billion.

====Now is key to curbing climate change – wind power sends an international signal====
**Global Wind Energy Council ~’12 (&amp;#34;**Wind Energy Must be Key Climate Change Solution,&amp;#34; http://www.gwec.net/index.php?id=136-http://www.gwec.net/index.php?id=136, Mike)
Climate change is now generally accepted to be the greatest environmental threat facing the world
AND
and the finance sector need for wind power to reach its full potential. 

====Climate change results in multiple scenarios for extinction – it~’s try or die for the aff====
**Sawin Senior Director of the Energy and Climate Change Program at the WorldWatch Institute Aug. ~’12 **(Janet, &amp;#34;Climate Change Poses Greater Security Threat than Terrorism,&amp;#34; http://www.worldwatch.org/node/77, Mike)

AND
carbon, with meaningful long-term targets that incorporate gradually declining caps.
