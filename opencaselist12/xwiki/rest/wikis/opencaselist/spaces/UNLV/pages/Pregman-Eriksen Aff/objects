PTC is Key to Energy Leadership&#xD;
By Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore. Member, House Ways And Means Committee, 2012 August 7 “Congress Should Extend PTC Immediately” http://energy.nationaljournal.com/2012/08/should-wind-tax-credit-stay-or.php&#xD;
The world is in the midst of an energy revolution. Due to rising fossil fuel prices, the instability of oil rich regions, and the increasing dangers of global climate change, communities all over the planet are looking for new, modern, sustainable sources of energy. The United States should lead the way in investment and innovation that will pay dividends both economically and environmentally for decades to come by extending the PTC.&#xD;
