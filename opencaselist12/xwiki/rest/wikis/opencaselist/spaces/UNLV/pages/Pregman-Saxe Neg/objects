**Webster~’s 00** Guide to Grammar and Writing (http://ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/marks/colon.htm-http://ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/marks/colon.htm)
Use of a colon before a list or an explanation that is preceded by a clause that can stand by itself. Think of the colon as a gate, inviting one to go on… If the introductory phrase preceding the colon is very brief and the clause following the colon represents the real business of the sentence, begin the clause after the colon with a capital letter.

**Black~’s Law Dictionary, ~’99** (Seventh Edition Ed. Bryan A. Garner (chief))
Federal government 1. A national government that exercises some degree of control over smaller political units that have surrendered some degree of power in exchange for the right to participate in national political matters.

A majority of those born between 1960 and 1980 seem to tend toward cynicism,

compromise becomes a kind of immorality, and constitutional refinements become inconvenient niceties.

====And, Clash- they refuse to debate the merits of their policy advocacy. Even if they claim to effect policymaking, the timeframe skew takes out any disad links====

**Ignatieff 4**, Carr Professor of Human Rights at Harvard University (Michael, LESSER EVILS, p. 20-21)
As for moral perfectionism, this would be the doctrine that a liberal state should

====This deliberation is the only way to minimize inevitable violence and evil ====

To insist that justified exercises of coercion can be defined as a lesser evil is

====And, Preparation- only limiting affs to topical USFG action creates a finite literature base. They kill topic education- they remove the incentive for specific negative. That base is a precondition for political action- unlimiting destroys political contest====
**Shively 00**, Associate Professor of Political Science at Texas A%26M University (Ruth, POLITICAL THEORY AND PARTISAN POLITICS, p. 180)
~’Thus far, I have argued that if the ambiguists mean to be subver¬sive about

In recent years, this discourse frequently has taken the form of the ecological horror

that a high proportion of species can be lost without precipitating a collapse.

====2. Collapse is common—====

====a. New species fill the void====
**Kerr 94** (Richard, Science 28)
In the immediate aftermath of an extinction, some taxa – groups of animals such as species or genera – flourish, then gradually fade. Others that had apparently vanished can reappear, Lazarus-like. In the turmoil, new groups may gain ascendancy, filling ecological niches left empty by the extinction and displacing other survivors to create a new ecological order (See box on p.29).

There is emerging consensus that the global food system is becoming more vulnerable and susceptible

that trading in futures markets may have amplified volatility in the short term. 


====Nuclear doesn~’t trade off with coal- only provides baseload power- keeps dirty energy on the grid====
**Chakravorty et al 2012** (Ujjayant, Professor of Economics at Tufts University and Fellow at the Toulouse School of Economics and CESifo, Resource Use under Climate Stabilization: Can Nuclear Power Provide Clean Energy?, Journal of Public Economic Theory, Volume 14, Issue 2, pages 349–389, March 2012, DOI: 10.1111/j.1467-9779.2011.01545.x)
An important issue not modeled in the paper is the issue of base load versus 
AND
the energy producer. This issue could hinder the adoption of nuclear technology.



====Nuke power declining now====
**Mez 2012** (Dr. Lutz, Coordinator of the Berlin Centre for Caspian Region Studies at the Free University of Berlin, Nuclear energy–Any solution for sustainability and climate protection?, Energy Policy, Volume 48, September 2012, Pages 56–63, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2012.04.047)
2. Any revival of nuclear power since 1981?¶ Has the global renaissance of 
AND
operation than in 2002, when the historical zenith of 444 was attained.

====No nuclear growth in India, China or Brazil====
**Mez 2012** (Dr. Lutz, Coordinator of the Berlin Centre for Caspian Region Studies at the Free University of Berlin, Nuclear energy–Any solution for sustainability and climate protection?, Energy Policy, Volume 48, September 2012, Pages 56–63, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2012.04.047)
The three biggest emerging market countries—India, China and Brazil—embarked on 
AND
2 percent of electrical power, with one additional reactor block under construction.
No prolif
They cause prolif



====They don~’t solve leadership advantages- all the manufacturing would happen overseas====
**Makhijani and Boyd 2010** (Arjun and Michele, electrical and nuclear engineer who is President of the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research; former director of the Safe Energy Program at Physicians for Social Responsibility; Small Modular¶ Reactors¶ No Solution for the Cost, Safety, and Waste Problems¶ of Nuclear Power, http://www.psr.org/nuclear-bailout/resources/small-modular-reactors-no.pdf)
Increased safety and¶ proliferation problems¶ Mass manufacturing raises a host of new¶ 
AND
arisen in many products from¶ drywall to infant formula to rabies vaccine.


====Cheap natural gas solves demand now ====
**Lamonica 8/9** (Martin, 12, Technology Review, &amp;#34;A Glut of Natural Gas Leaves Nuclear Power Stalled&amp;#34; http://www.technologyreview.com/news/428737/a-glut-of-natural-gas-leaves-nuclear-power/)
The nuclear renaissance is in danger of petering out before it has even begun, 
AND
13 per million BTUs; prices have now dropped to around %243. 


====Leadership IS NOT based on domestic industry- it~’s based on the LEGACY of safety and tech leadership, which the SQ obviously solves- no reason institutional legitimacy will go away if we do renewables instead====
**Domenici and Miller September 2012** (Senator Pete V. Domenici¶ Former U.S. Senator and Bipartisan¶ Policy Center Senior Fellow¶ ENERGY PROJECT STAFF¶ Lourdes Long¶ Senior Policy Analyst¶ Warren F. &amp;#34;Pete&amp;#34; Miller, Ph.D.¶ Former Department of Energy Assistant¶ Secretary for Nuclear Energy; Maintaining U.S.¶ Leadership in¶ Global Nuclear¶ Energy Markets, http://bipartisanpolicy.org/sites/default/files/Nuclear%20Report.PDF)
Given this near-term expansion, the United States will¶ continue to be 
AND
by¶ newer-generation resources (potentially including some¶ nuclear replacements).
