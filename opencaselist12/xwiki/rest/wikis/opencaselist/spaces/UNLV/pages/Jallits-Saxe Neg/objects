 Base Mobilization key to winning the election—empirically proven for incumbents

Reichardt 7/9. (Adam is the Managing Editor of New Eastern Europe, “Considering Russia in the Voting Booth,” New Eastern Europe, 2012, http://www.neweasterneurope.eu/node/382)

Obama’s policy towards Russia is easier to gauge, since there has already been four years of his administration to judge. As Ross Wilson noted, “President Obama has a four-year record with Russia to defend – i.e., the reset policy and the benefits that the administration will argue have accrued from its more pragmatic and less confrontational approach to relations with Moscow.”
President Obama’s policy of reset was indeed a glimmer of hope for US-Russian relations at the start of 2009, but that glimmer has all but faded. The case of Syria and Iran are clear examples of the real challenges America still faces when engaging with Russia on global issues and the Obama campaign will most likely avoid referring to the “reset” by name.
“Though the Administration will not use the expression ‘reset’ too much, it can be expected to continue to emphasize pragmatism and to implement that line if the president is re-elected,” Wilson believes.
Obama’s opponent, Mitt Romney, has been less clear about his position on relations
AND
no Cold War, but Russia is a geopolitical foe in that regard.&amp;#34;
The Romney campaign’s web site reveals several areas of focus for Russia, none of them discuss active engagement, but rather focus on taking tougher stances with Russia, including renegotiating the New Start Treaty, decreasing Europe’s energy reliance on Russia, building stronger relations with Central Asia, as well as supporting Russia’s civil society.
Surprisingly, the last one, engaging Russia’s civil society, could be the most

in the opposition – it could hurt the entire goal of this platform.
Having the American government play an active role in the changes happening inside Russia could be detrimental to US-Russian relations. Many Russians believe that changes within their own country should be driven from the Russian society. Any outside interference would hurt the legitimacy of the Russian opposition and cause the Russian elite to become even more suspicious, and perhaps even hostile, to the intentions of American foreign policy.

Economy
Plan can’t solve the economy
Post, 11 (Willem, SME New Jersey Institute of Technology, MSME Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, MBA, University of Connecticut. P.E. Connecticut. Consulting Engineer and Project Manager, “Wind Energy Does Little to Reduce CO2 Emissions”, 9/8/11, http://theenergycollective.com/node/64492) WP
Within federal, state and local governments tens of thousands of people are busying themselves promoting renewables by with holding meetings and public hearings, preparing studies, writing reports, energy plans, laws, rules and regulations, monitoring projects for compliance, etc.¶ Outside of government wind turbine vendors (Siemens, GE, Vestas, Iberdrola, etc,), project developers/owners, financiers managing tax shelters, trade organizations, etc., are busying themselves popularizing wind energy as saving the planet from global warming with PR campaigns that claim there would be significant reductions of fossil fuel consumption and CO2 reductions/kWh, that capital costs/MW would decrease, and that wind energy costs/kWh would be at grid parity in the near future. These claims have largely not been realized. ¶ Global Warming is a Given: A just-released report from EIA shows the actual world energy consumption data and projected consumption data for the 1990 to 2035 period. The report shows world energy consumption is estimated to increase from 505 quads in 2008 to 770 quads in 2035, a 52% increase. The biggest part of the increase is by (non-OECD nations + Asia).¶ http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/ieo/world.cfm¶ See spreadsheet associated with figure 12¶ World energy consumption by fuel (quadrillion Btu) ¶ Liquids: From 173.2 in 2010 to 225.1 in 2035; 30% more¶ Natural gas: 116.7 to 174.7; 50% more¶ Coal: 149.4 to 209.1; 49% more¶ Nuclear: 27.6 to 51.2; 86% more¶ Renewables: 55.2 to 109.5; 98% more¶ Renewables fraction of total consumption: From 10.6% in 2010 to 15.2% in 2035¶ Fossil fraction of total consumption: 84.1% to 79.1%¶ The significant increase in projected fossil fuel consumption during the next 24 years means global warming will continue unabated, because (non-OECD + ASIA) will have energy consumption growth far outpacing the energy consumption growth of the rest of the world; i.e., global warming is a given. ¶ The above indicates the enormous investments required to achieve the 2035 projected renewables energy production would have practically no benefit regarding global warming.¶ This means policy makers should shift renewables subsidies to energy efficiency which will not only reduce CO2 without controversies, but will actually do some good for household and business energy bills and thereby raise their living standards and profits.¶ That would be the rational thing to do. However, using Greenspan&amp;#39;s words, the people, including legislators and bureaucrats, have become &amp;#34;irrationally exuberant&amp;#34; regarding renewables reducing global warming. The above shows, it is an expensive and futile tilting at wind mills a la Don Quixote.¶ Competitiveness: The above begs the question: If wind energy reduces CO2 by so very little/kWh, or not at all, or increases it, AND requires so much capital/MW to implement, AND produces energy at such a high cost/kWh, AND has such huge adverse impacts on quality of life (noise and infrasound, visuals, social unrest, psychological), property values and the environment, why are we, as a nation, making ourselves even less efficient relative to our competitors by this slavish, lemming-like pursuit of expensive wind energy?¶ Who Benefits: Could it be that the Wall Street elites see the 30% federal cash grants, accelerated write-offs, generous feed-in tariffs and renewable energy credits as major tax shelters and long-term income streams (preferably tax-free) for themselves and their high-income clients, all at the expense of the Main Street economy which is already economically depressed? ¶ If the amounts of the grants and taxes-not-collected due to these deductions from taxable incomes are totaled, it would be evident wind energy is very expensively subsidized indeed; not helpful for reducing budget deficits.¶ Roll more and more such expensive wind energy into rate schedules and the US will become even less competitive than at present: not helpful for reducing trade deficits. ¶ Wind energy promoters often use Denmark as the model to emulate. However, Denmark is in the unique position of having a large capacity of hydro plants of Norway and Sweden available for balancing wind energy; i.e., other grids with little or no hydro plants cannot use Denmark as a model. This unique position has been unfortunate for Danish households, because their electric rates are the highest in Europe; France, 80% nuclear, has the lowest.

One final point of potential concern is that MLPs have typically been used to finance

A second disadvantage of MLPs is their relatively limited ability to accumulate cash. As noted above, MLPs contractually obligate themselves to distribute 100% of their available cash each quarter. As a result, MLPs cannot build up war chests like traditional corporations and are therefore highly dependent upon external sources of financing to fund their growth projects and acquisitions.

2NC Cant Solve Global Emissions
Cant Offset Global CO2 Emissions
Post, 11 (Willem, SME New Jersey Institute of Technology, MSME Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, MBA, University of Connecticut. P.E. Connecticut. Consulting Engineer and Project Manager, “Wind Energy Does Little to Reduce CO2 Emissions”, 9/8/11, http://theenergycollective.com/node/64492) WP
Within federal, state and local governments tens of thousands of people are busying themselves promoting renewables by with holding meetings and public hearings, preparing studies, writing reports, energy plans, laws, rules and regulations, monitoring projects for compliance, etc.¶ Outside of government wind turbine vendors (Siemens, GE, Vestas, Iberdrola, etc,), project developers/owners, financiers managing tax shelters, trade organizations, etc., are busying themselves popularizing wind energy as saving the planet from global warming with PR campaigns that claim there would be significant reductions of fossil fuel consumption and CO2 reductions/kWh, that capital costs/MW would decrease, and that wind energy costs/kWh would be at grid parity in the near future. These claims have largely not been realized. ¶ Global Warming is a Given: A just-released report from EIA shows the actual world energy consumption data and projected consumption data for the 1990 to 2035 period. The report shows world energy consumption is estimated to increase from 505 quads in 2008 to 770 quads in 2035, a 52% increase. The biggest part of the increase is by (non-OECD nations + Asia).¶ http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/ieo/world.cfm¶ See spreadsheet associated with figure 12¶ World energy consumption by fuel (quadrillion Btu) ¶ Liquids: From 173.2 in 2010 to 225.1 in 2035; 30% more¶ Natural gas: 116.7 to 174.7; 50% more¶ Coal: 149.4 to 209.1; 49% more¶ Nuclear: 27.6 to 51.2; 86% more¶ Renewables: 55.2 to 109.5; 98% more¶ Renewables fraction of total consumption: From 10.6% in 2010 to 15.2% in 2035¶ Fossil fraction of total consumption: 84.1% to 79.1%¶ The significant increase in projected fossil fuel consumption during the next 24 years means global warming will continue unabated, because (non-OECD + ASIA) will have energy consumption growth far outpacing the energy consumption growth of the rest of the world; i.e., global warming is a given. ¶ The above indicates the enormous investments required to achieve the 2035 projected renewables energy production would have practically no benefit regarding global warming.¶ This means policy makers should shift renewables subsidies to energy efficiency which will not only reduce CO2 without controversies, but will actually do some good for household and business energy bills and thereby raise their living standards and profits.¶ That would be the rational thing to do. However, using Greenspan&amp;#39;s words, the people, including legislators and bureaucrats, have become &amp;#34;irrationally exuberant&amp;#34; regarding renewables reducing global warming. The above shows, it is an expensive and futile tilting at wind mills a la Don Quixote.¶

But 2004 suggests that both sides&amp;#39; strategies may start with mobilizing the core.
Obama win key to US-Russia relations – Romney’s agenda is belligerent and controversial.
Reichardt 7/9. (Adam is the Managing Editor of New Eastern Europe, “Considering Russia in the Voting Booth,” New Eastern Europe, 2012, http://www.neweasterneurope.eu/node/382)

Obama’s policy towards Russia is easier to gauge, since there has already been four years of his administration to judge. As Ross Wilson noted, “President Obama has a four-year record with Russia to defend – i.e., the reset policy and the benefits that the administration will argue have accrued from its more pragmatic and less confrontational approach to relations with Moscow.”
President Obama’s policy of reset was indeed a glimmer of hope for US-Russian relations at the start of 2009, but that glimmer has all but faded. The case of Syria and Iran are clear examples of the real challenges America still faces when engaging with Russia on global issues and the Obama campaign will most likely avoid referring to the “reset” by name.
“Though the Administration will not use the expression ‘reset’ too much, it can be expected to continue to emphasize pragmatism and to implement that line if the president is re-elected,” Wilson believes.
Obama’s opponent, Mitt Romney, has been less clear about his position on relations
AND
no Cold War, but Russia is a geopolitical foe in that regard.&amp;#34;
The Romney campaign’s web site reveals several areas of focus for Russia, none of them discuss active engagement, but rather focus on taking tougher stances with Russia, including renegotiating the New Start Treaty, decreasing Europe’s energy reliance on Russia, building stronger relations with Central Asia, as well as supporting Russia’s civil society.
Surprisingly, the last one, engaging Russia’s civil society, could be the most
AND
in the opposition – it could hurt the entire goal of this platform.
Having the American government play an active role in the changes happening inside Russia could be detrimental to US-Russian relations. Many Russians believe that changes within their own country should be driven from the Russian society. Any outside interference would hurt the legitimacy of the Russian opposition and cause the Russian elite to become even more suspicious, and perhaps even hostile, to the intentions of American foreign policy.

A2: Perm Do Both

    Hold them to the text of the permutation in the 2AC – 1AR clarifications of what this means are sandbagging and a voting issue because we don’t get to actually answer the substance of the argument until the 2NR
    2. Prior and binding key – otherwise the public won’t participate and links to politics – means no solvency

    Citizen opposition to transportation projects is often explained as being fueled by a fundamental sense
    AND
    issue first and foremost lest the complete process loses all meaning and dignity.
     4. ZERO risk of a net benefit to the permutation – only a risk of NIMBY backlash – perm has to have a net benefit or theoretical justification to be legitimate otherwise the aff can make them endlessly without explanation or warrant – hypotesting died out in the 80’s

A2: Perm Do the CP

    The perm is functional severance – the CP never mandates the plan happens – it’s a completely different action, ALL of which ALWAYS happens – reg-negs are not resolved because they allow invited parties to amend or nullify the affs reduction on regulations – that’s a voting issue for fairness and education because it destroys all neg ground
    A2: Reg Neg Takes a Long Time
    Reg Neg is comparatively faster – litigation issues with the environment alone take years to overcome – public backlash to the plan delays any of their internal links and not the CP because it engages the public at the beginning of the process – that’s Nolon
    This means the CP happens faster than the aff*
    Siegel 10 (Joseph A., Senior Attorney for the EPA, Pace Environmental Law Review, “/collaborative Decision Making on Climate Change in the Federal Government”, L/X) CC

A2: This is about NEPA
True, but it is about focus groups who get mad about lack of federal involvement that are environmental issues
4. This also massively mitigates solvency – the long-term time and cost of public battles is what batters energy development – the CP ensures pragmatic policy decisions

Siobhan Mee, Executive Director of the Boston College Environmental Affairs Law Review, Fall, 1997
(25 B.C. Envtl. Aff. L. Rev. 213)
Another criticism of traditional rulemaking is that it is slow and cumbersome. 14 Major rules require an average of three and one-half years for their creation and promulgation. 15 A subsequent court challenge, which EPA estimates to be an eighty-five percent possibility for each of its regulations, may delay the implementation of a rule even further. 16

2. Textual severance – We don’t need to compete on certainty but they have to defend it- “should” requires immediacy and certainty

Insert Reg-Neg Good block

Theory – CP Legitimate
Our interpretation – counterplans that recommend plan but don’t fiat passage are good – counterplans that contingently fiat passage are bad- solves their offense by eliminating CPs like consult and QPQ
Allowing Reg-Neg CPs is good- key to check a large topic with no unifying themes between the 6 energies and two mechanisms, key to access the lit base on rhetorical commitment versus material action, gives the aff built-in solvency deficit ground by saying the plan wouldn’t be implemented
Grounded in the literature – there is a widespread push to include energy policy in regulatory negotiations

2NC Overview

The disad outweighs and turns the case – 

A) Key timeframe distinction – link timeframe outweighs impact timeframe – the 1NC Hitchens evidence indicates that other nations will preempt US tech if they think the US is trying to pursue space dominance – means only the disad can turn the case

B) Magnitude – the Mitchell evidence indicates that space preemption would spill over to land wars – other nations would perceive the threat and attack with nuclear or biological weapons in the midst of crisis

C) Probability – Mitchell indicates that space warfare can be triggered by tech accidents and miscalculation – means intervening actors can’t check

  Turns the case – preemption causes debris and prevents solvency

Forden 8 - Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Geoffrey, Astropolitics, 6:138–153, “VIEWPOINT: CHINA AND SPACE WAR,” Ebsco Political Science)

If the short-term military consequences to the U.S. were not

of collisions that renders space unusable from hundreds to thousands of years.14

  Here’s an external impact – the perception of weaponization causes war with Russia and China and leads to ground attacks

Hitchens 2 (Theresa, Center for Defense Information Vice President, http://www.cdi.org/missile-defense/spaceweapons.cfm, 4-18-02, “Weapons in Space: Silver Bullet or Russian Roulette? The Policy Implications of U.S. Pursuit of Space-Based Weapons”)

Could a Space Race Undercut U.S. Military Dominance? The United States

strategic and direct military risks, and the costs, of weaponizing space.

  War with Russia is the only existential risk

Bostrum 02 – professor of philosophy at Oxford (March, Nick, “Existential Risks: Analyzing Human Extinction Scenarios and Related Hazards,” Journal of Evolution and Technology, http://www.nickbostrom.com/existential/risks.html)

A much greater existential risk emerged with the build-up of nuclear arsenals in
AND
preludes to the existential risks that we will encounter in the 21st century.

Prolif Module

We argue that additional proliferation of nuclear weapons, rather than new arms races,

  Prolif dramatically increases the risk of accidental, intentional, or terror-based nuclear war

Utgoff 2 - Deputy Director of Strategy, Forces, and Resources @ the Institute for Defense Analyses (Victor, Survival, “Proliferation, Missile Defense and American Ambitions”, 44:2, Summer, p. 87-90)

Thorium, not renewable, is the best way to fight climate change -  renewable can’t match nuclear’s energy output
New Scientist, 2011 March 26th, “Rescuing Nuclear Power” Vol. 209 Issue 2805, Lexis, V. Guevara
For some, nuclear energy, in particular thorium, is the best way to

Impact O/V
DA outweighs and turns the case—Relations are key to arms reduction—Russian launch destroys the U.S. within thirty minutes and escalates into every impact in the book. The two largest nuclear arsenals in the world simultaneously exploding causes waves of diseases and firestorms destroying support systems—they do not have an impact of greater magnitude

Shortest time-frame
Mintz 1 (Morton, February 26, “Two Minutes to Launch,” The American Prospect, http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?article=two_minutes_to_launch)
Hair-trigger alert means this: The missiles carrying those warheads are armed and

would be, basically, a nuclear war by checklist, by rote.&amp;#34;
Conflict turns the case—Nuclear conflict makes developing nuclear plants impossible—They’d be destroyed before construction would even be completed
Relations solves prolif—Relations means they can continue arms reduction talks, that’s Collins and Rjonski
Relations solve space—Two faster countries to get to space working together means they can get to space—Remember Sputnik and Apollo

Policy statements are intended to provide the public with a sense of an agency&amp;#39;s position

The CP doesn’t just PIC out of certainty~-~--there is zero world in which voting neg includes mandating that any part of the plan be done~-~--there is nothing in the CP that could reasonably constitute the plan~-~--it’s different than a CP that, for instance, conditioned the plan on the outcome of some review process~-~--our CP never contains the possibility of mandating the adoption of the plan~-~--means the perm has to be severance.

Charles H. Koch 5, the Dudley W. Woodbridge Professor of Law, William and Mary School of Law, Spring 2005, “Policymaking by the Administrative Judiciary,” Alabama Law Review, 56 Ala. L. Rev. 693, p. lexis
The question of application is complicated because administrative rules may have differing force and administrative

different type of pronouncement from legislative rules, and this difference should be reflected

 in the weight given by an agency&amp;#39;s adjudicators. n109 A nonlegislative rule is a device for announcing policy. n110 They are intended to disclose the agency&amp;#39;s views and offer guidance regarding agency law. n111 Thus, an agency must *716 obey these pronouncements as well as legislative rules unless a deviation can be justified. n112

    A2: Recommendation CPs Bad
    No link to any of their offense~-~--the CP never fiats any part of the plan~-~--the only action mandated by the CP is the release of a memo supporting the end-point of the plan, which we argue causes the functionally same on-the-ground implementation~-~--this distinction is of paramount importance~-~--their theory args presume the CP mandates the plan~-~--this should be a question of solvency evidence, not theoretical legitimacy.
    Hold the line on their claims of what our CP justifies~-~--it’s fundamentally distinct from the worst CPs like consult, condition the plan, etc because it never even has the possibility of mandating the adoption of the plan.
    This style of CP is vital to neg ground~-~--every negative argument relies on holding the aff responsible for defending a mandated increase in exploration~-~--means the CP is a fundamental test of the desirability of the resolution.

Ext. 1 – Prolif Slow
Extend Waltz – proliferation will be slow. Their authors are paranoid and continually over-state the risk. Since the 60s, they have claimed we were on the brink of a massive wave of proliferation, but there are still less than 10 countries with nukes and only a couple more are threatening
And, it will stay slow – 3 reasons
First, Capability—
Iran proves it takes decades to develop an arsenal; new weapons don’t appear out of thin air
Fox 7 (Stuart, author for Scienceline, “Why is it taking Iran so long to make a nuclear weapons? Didn’t it only take the US four years to invent them?”)  http://scienceline.org/2007/11/20/ask-fox-nuclearbombs/
Iran and its nuclear program appears a great deal in the news these days, even with estimates that they are five to ten years away from completing a nuclear weapon. To understand why it’s taken Iran over 18 years to build a bomb, one needs to consider the steps it takes to build a bomb, and differences between the conditions in which Iran and the U.S. pursued this technology.
And, expenses – the sheer number of workers and materials means that developing weapons won’t be quick.
Fox 7 (Stuart, author for Scienceline, “Why is it taking Iran so long to make a nuclear weapons? Didn’t it only take the US four years to invent them?”)  http://scienceline.org/2007/11/20/ask-fox-nuclearbombs/
According to “The Making of the Atomic Bomb” by Richard Rhodes, to

week, took three years to produce enough properly enriched uranium for the bomb
Second, Motive – states don’t want instant recluse status
Elhefnawy 8 (Nader, B.A international relations, author books, “The Next Wave of Nuclear Proliferation”)  http://www.carlisle.army.mil/usawc/Parameters/08autumn/elhefnawy.pdf
Long-established research strongly indicates that the motivation to build nuclear weapons is more
AND
little as $500 million, less than the price of a modern warship
Third, No Arms Race – nuclear weapons make force comparisons irrelevant

One may believe that old American and Soviet military doctrines set the pattern that new

ranges neither side need respond to increases in the other side’s military capabilities.

b. Disarm—South Africa, Belarus, and Kazakhstan all voluntarily disarmed at the same time other states were rearming, there’s no correlation
