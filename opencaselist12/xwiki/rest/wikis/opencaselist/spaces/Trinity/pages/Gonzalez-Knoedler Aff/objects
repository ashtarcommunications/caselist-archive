====Still too many contentious and polarizing issues—The bill isn~’t CLOSE to overcoming ANY of these====
**Gonzalez, 02/03** (Daniel, political analyst for the republic, &amp;#34;Paths to immigration reform will be bumpy&amp;#34; on 2/3/13 from www.azcentral.com/news/politics/articles/20130130immigration-reform-bumpy.html)
Congress will face pressure from border-community leaders such as Arizona Gov. Jan 
AND
and passing a comprehensive immigration bill becomes even more complicated, she said.



====The disadvantage isn~’t an opportunity cost — Modeling decisions off the AGENT OF THE RESOLUTION is key to effective decision making skills. That~’s the ONLY portable education with a debate key warrant—====


====THERE IS NO connection between the bill their uniqueness evidence is hopeful of and the ideal legislation required to solve the internal link—====


====You should have the same threshold for this connection as you would apply to affirmative solvency evidence—====

Hirsh previously served as the senior editor and national economics correspondent for Newsweek, based in its Washington bureau. ~~http://www.nationaljournal.com/magazine/there-s-no-such-thing-as-political-capital-20130207~~
Meanwhile, the Republican members of the Senate~’s so-called Gang of Eight are

to do with Obama~’s political capital or, indeed, Obama at all.

So on this issue, Republicans have both strategic and substantive reasons for making a

The fever is low now, but that doesn~’t mean it can~’t spike.

**Kelly 2-8**-13. Erin Kelly, Gannett Washington Bureau. USA Today  &amp;#34;Gay rights becoming controversy in immigration reform&amp;#34;
WASHINGTON — Gay rights has emerged as an unexpected point of controversy in the congressional

affect 30,000 to 40,000 gay Americans and their partners.

**Capital~’s irrelevant—CIR is only a wedge issue for democrats. Gang of Eight and Demographic consciousness ensures passage**

~~http://www.nationaljournal.com/columns/political-connections/on-immigration-what-obama-can-learn-from-bush-s-failed-efforts-20130131~~
Even in 2006, something like the Senate plan likely could have attracted 218 votes 
AND
should expect much more public heat, because Obama won~’t be as deferential.


====Legislation is locked in—Gang of Eight ensures GOP gets on board====
**HP, 02/03** (Huffington Post, &amp;#34;Harry Reid On Immigration Reform: ~’This Legislation Is Going To Pass~’ (VIDEO)&amp;#34; on 2/3/13 from www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/03/harry-reid-immigration-reform_n_2610182.html)

Still, &amp;#34;the problem is always in the details, and that was certainly 
AND
victory, as well as a serious problem for Republicans in the future.

====Immigration Reform won~’t solve agriculture—Shortages are inevitable====
Plumer 1-29-13. Brad, Washington POST &amp;#34;We~’re running out of farm workers. Immigration reform won~’t help.&amp;#34; ~~http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/01/29/the-u-s-is-running-out-of-farm-workers-immigration-reform-may-not-help/?wprss=rss_ezra-klein~~

We face a combination of ecological, social, and economic crises. These crises 
AND
then it will only be a respite before the pattern once again intensifies.


====The impact is lash out and extinction—====
Kothari, 82 (professor of poli sci at U of Delhi, &amp;#34;Towards a Just Social Order,&amp;#34; p. 571)
Attempts at global economic reform could also lead to a world racked by increasing turbulence, a greater sense of insecurity among the major centers of power – and hence to a further tightening of the structures of domination and domestic repression – producing in their wake an intensification of the old arms race and militarization of regimes, encouraging regional conflagrations and setting the stage for an eventual global holocaust. 


====These impacts matter—Don~’t evaluate their ethics or scholarship in a vacuum ====
**Isaac**, 200**2 **(Jeffrey C., James H. Rudy professor of Political Science and director of the Center for the Study of Democracy and Public Life at Indiana University, Bloomington, &amp;#34;Ends, Means and politics,&amp;#34; Dissent, Spring)
As writers such as Niccolo Machiavelli,Max Weber, Reinhold Niebuhr, and HannahArendt

The &amp;#34;resource curse,&amp;#34; as it~’s called, has long been a popular phenomenon

Nikolayev point to an alarming fact – the pace of economic growth is slowing despite high oil prices. &amp;#34;At %2470-%2475 per barrel we were growing at 7%-8% annually four years ago. Now our growth rates are much slower despite the higher oil prices.&amp;#34;

Production:  See production terms associated with specific energy types.
Production capacity:  The amount of product that can be produced from processing facilities.
Production costs:  Costs incurred to operate and maintain wells and related equipment and facilities
AND
ad valorem taxes; production or severance taxes; other, including overhead.
Production expenses:  Costs incurred in the production of electric power that conform to the accounting requirements of the Operation and Maintenance Expense Accounts of the FERC Uniform System of Accounts.
Production payments:  A contractual arrangement providing a mineral interest that gives the owner a right to receive a fraction of production, or of proceeds from the sale of production, until a specified quantity of minerals (or a definite sum of money, including interest) has been received.
Production plant liquids:  The volume of liquids removed from natural gas in natural gas processing plants or cycling plants during the year.
Production, crude oil:  The volumes of crude oil that are extracted from oil reservoirs. These volumes are determined through measurement of the volumes delivered from lease storage tanks or at the point of custody transfer, with adjustment for (1) net differences between opening and closing lease inventories and (2) basic sediment and water. Crude oil used on the lease is considered production.
Production, lease condensate:  The volume of lease condensate produced. Lease condensate volumes include only those volumes recovered from lease or field separation facilities.
Production, natural gas:  The volume of natural gas withdrawn from reservoirs less (
AND
This differs from &amp;#34;Marketed Production&amp;#34; which excludes flared and vented gas.)
Production, natural gas liquids:  Production of natural gas liquids is classified as follows:
Contract Production. Natural gas liquids accruing to a company because of its ownership of liquids extraction facilities that it uses to extract liquids from gas belonging to others, thereby earning a portion of the resultant liquids.
Leasehold Production. Natural gas liquids produced, extracted, and credited to a company~’s interest.
Contract Reserves. Natural gas liquid reserves corresponding to the contract production defined above.
Leasehold Reserves. Natural gas liquid reserves corresponding to leasehold production defined above.
Production, natural gas, dry:  The volume of natural gas withdrawn from reservoirs during the report year less:
the volume returned to such reservoirs in cycling, repressuring of oil reservoirs, and conservation operations; less
shrinkage resulting from the removal of lease condensate and plant liquids; and less
nonhydrocarbon gases where they occur insufficient quantity to render the gas unmarketable.
Volumes of gas withdrawn from gas storage reservoirs and native gas, which has been transferred to the storage category, are not considered production. This is not the same as marketed production, because the latter also excludes vented and flared gas, but contains plant liquids.
Production, natural gas, wet after lease separation:  The volume of natural gas 
AND
not the same as marketed production, which excludes vented and flared gas.
Production, oil and gas:  The lifting of oil and gas to the surface 
AND
pipeline, a common carrier, a refinery, or a marine terminal.

At the forefront of concerns for western energy producers are federal public lands policies,

reasonable time and cost expectations to enable them to execute their business plans.

Anything else decimates solvency—
**API ~’12.** &amp;#34;The State of American Energy.&amp;#34; The American Petroleum Institute (API) is the only national trade association that represents all aspects of America~’s oil and natural gas industry. ~~http://www.api.org/newsroom/upload/soae-2012-report-layout-mechanical.pdf~~ **~~MG~~**
Despite the clear benefits of developing U.S. oil and natural gas resources, the industry still faces many public policy obstacles.As it stands, 85 percent of America~’s offshore acreage is off-limits to development, and 60 percent of federal onshore lands are off-limits. 153
 Increased access to these resources and regions is essential to strengthening the U.S. economy and energy security.
The industry simply needs government approval to begin the exploration process—completing new seismic surveys and drilling exploratory wells—to gather updated information and understand potential domestic resources. 
Yet energy policy to date has denied the opportunity to even begin to gather this information. And without planned lease sales in areas that have been kept off-limits, companies have little incentive to pursue these important pre-production activities and gather new information on the potential for development in these frontier areas.
Other barriers to industry progress are overly burdensome regulations and sluggish leasing and permitting processes—even though the president himself has called for the elimination of federal regulations that overly impede those businesses that are trying to create jobs. 
For example, the Environmental Protection Agency~’s (EPA) proposed rule covering new regulations 
AND
cost jobs, hurt consumers, and reduce revenue to the government. 156
The oil and natural gas industry needs regulatory, permitting and leasing processes that are thorough, efficient and predictable. That means allowing for exploration and production of much-needed energy resources and ensuring that development takes place in a responsible and sustainable way, without unnecessary regulatory impediments or delays.

As we~’ve noted, 94% of federal onshore lands and 97% of federal offshore lands are off-limits to oil and gas drilling. Include in that total the vast reserves of the Green River Formation and other federal lands on and offshore banned from drilling as part of a manufactured oil and gas crisis. The Obama administration recently rescinded 77 oil and gas leases in Utah.
As we~’ve also noted, the Environmental Protection Agency, in response to environmental groups, tried to manufacture a crisis in which hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, was said to have contaminated test wells in Pavillion, Wyo. Those claims and others made in the six-decade history of the technology have proved groundless.
How much oil are we really talking about? &amp;#34;The Rand Corporation, a nonprofit research organization, estimates that 30% to 60% of the oil shale in the Green River Formation can be recovered,&amp;#34; Mittal testified. &amp;#34;At the midpoint of this estimate, almost half of the 3 trillion barrels of oil would be recoverable. This is an amount about equal to the entire world~’s proven oil reserves.&amp;#34;
