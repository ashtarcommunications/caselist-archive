Hancock 2003 (Dr. Jan Hancock is a lecturer in the Department of Political Science where he teaches courses on political sociology, US foreign policy, globalization and the United Nations.) “Environmental Human Rights: Power, Ethics and Law” p.22-24


This lens justifies itself through faux science and easing the industrialized world’s guilt about environmental destruction- leading to an endless cycle degradation 
Alf Hornborg 2001 (Alf Hornborg is an anthropologist and professor of human ecology at Lund University, Sweden.) “The Power of the Machine: Global Inequalities of Economy, Technology, and Environment” p.24-26


This economic rationality about the environment is codified into federal law- the EPACT of 2005 is an example of this logic par excellence it requires that solar energy be “Economically feasible” in order to install on federal buildings

Green, Green Power in Green Spaces: Policy Options to Promote Renewable Energy Use in U.S. National Parks, Masters in Public Policy Thesis Submitted in Fulfillment of the Graduation Requirements for the College of Liberal Arts/Public Policy Program at Rochester Institute of Technology, March 2006, https://ritdml.rit.edu/bitstream/handle/1850/2669/EGreenThesis03-2006.pdf?sequence=1]



This logic has set us on a course leading to planetary catastrophe and eco-side-

There is a dissonance between concern for the environment and action- objective analysis of the destruction of the environment fails to spur material change- only an ethics grounded in the intrinsic value of the earth can overcome the status quo

Kopnina 2012, Helen Ph.D. Cambridge University,  anthropocentric Bias in Anthropology: Re-Examining Culture/Conservation Conflict



We should stop destruction of the Earth for the Earth’s sake-anything else would be arbitrary and replicate the destruction of the status quo
Derrick Jensen 2010 (American author and environmental activist. He was named one of Utne Reader’s “50 Visionaries Who Are Changing Your World” and won the Eric Hoffer Award in 2008.) “Toward a Global Consensus for Ethical Action” from the introduction of “Moral Ground: Ethical Action for a Planet in Peril” p. 67-68





Plan: The United States federal government should remove the economic feasibility clause from the Energy Policy act of 2005 for solar energy. 


You can’t separate the ethics of the 1ac from our plan text- environmental ethicists must combine ethical and epistemological challenges to the status quo as well as posit good institutional changes 
JOEL J. KASSIOLA 2003  (Joel J. Kassiola is dean of the College of Behavioral and Social Sciences and professor apolitical science at San Francisco State University.) “Can Environmental Ethics ‘Solve’ Environmental  Problems and Save the World? Yes, but First We Must  Recognise the Essential Normative Nature of  Environmental Problems” http://bss.sfsu.edu/kassiola/docs/environmentalvaluesarticle.pdf


The economic feasibility clause is arbitrary and bad

Academic spaces have agency- contesting the squo free market ideology that tries to delegitimize the environmental movement is key 
Nadivah Greenberg 2006 [doctoral candidate in political science at the University of Pennsylvania. Her research and teaching experience cover political theory and international relations with specialization in global environmental politics, consumption, and American conservatism. Now completing her dissertation on contemporary American conservative thought and environmental politics in theory and practice, she is the recipient of a Gentle Foundation Teaching Fellowship at the University of Pennsylvania on this theme in the fall of 2006. ¶ Shop Right: ¶ American Conservatisms, Consumption, and the Environment ¶ Global Environmental Politics 6.2 (2006) 85-111 [Project Muse]


Every attempt to create a predictive model of international relations has failed. An inherently dynamic international sphere is impossible to causally define into the future. There is so much conflicting data it is impossible to distinguish between link and link turn without creating a tapestry of lies.
