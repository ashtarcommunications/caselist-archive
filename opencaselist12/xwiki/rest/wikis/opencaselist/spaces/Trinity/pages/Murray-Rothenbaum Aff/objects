When he gave the world Professor Challenger, Conan Doyle was already justly famous for &#xD;
AND&#xD;
or that the motor of this generalized impoverishment of the biosphere is capitalism. &#xD;
&#xD;
Challenger’s project requires a-priori detachment of the self from the Earth surrounding it.  In order to view the Earth as a distinct entity from the self, the self must maintain rigidity.  &#xD;
&#xD;
The organizational principal here is Desire.  Desire is at work everywhere – it breaths, eats, walks, runs, startles, and flows in every possible direction.  Desire is productive – creating, building, shaping thoughts and actions, but desire is also controlled by forces outside of the immediate subject taking form in the world.  Media representations, the rhetorical soup of everyday interaction, and inputs we are not even fully aware of all shape desire.  &#xD;
Ballantyne 2007 (Andrew, Tectonic Cultures Research Group at Newcastle University , &amp;#34;Deleuze and Guattari for Architects&amp;#34; 27-28)&#xD;
So these habits of thought, once they are planted in us, take over &#xD;
AND&#xD;
utterance seems, from an alternate view, to have an inaccurate aspect.&#xD;
&#xD;
Desire can be active or reactive.  When desire is affirmative and active it has no care for political systems, kings, gods, or lineage.  Desire that is affirmative embraces the world as it is and finds ways to positively operate within the social linkages at our fingertips.  When desire turns reactionary it becomes immanently tied to ressentiment – a hatred of the world as it is – and fostered internally is “an inability to be in the world” which becomes life itself.  Ultimately, ressentiment becomes inseparably tied to desire, resulting in self-destructive politics.&#xD;
Deleuze and Guattari 77 (AO 26-29)&#xD;
&#xD;
In point of fact, if desire is the lack of the real object, &#xD;
AND&#xD;
perversion of the desire of the masses that needs to be accounted for.&#xD;
&#xD;
Desire is an intimately personal phenomenon which resonates outwards from the self to macro-level entities like the state.  Fascism is not handed down from the USFG, rather fascism originates in the desires of the masses in forms we may not even be aware of.  Before change can take place at the macrolevel we must challenge the very fascist inside of us.&#xD;

&#xD;
Is it really the displacement of disguising of a true image of action, or &#xD;
AND&#xD;
a concomitant revolution of on the level of instincts: a molecular revolution!&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
Philosophy is not a thinking game but a doing game.  Acting, seeing, living the world.  To become closer to the Earth, to become plant rock or animal, we must first and foremost abandon any constant attachment to transcendent figures.  &#xD;
Deleuze and Guattari, 1972 (Anti-Oedipus, 1-8)&#xD;
A schizophrenic out for a walk is a better model than a neurotic lying on &#xD;
AND&#xD;
-self, outside and inside, no longer have any meaning whatsoever.&#xD;
&#xD;
Within our conception of desire we have an answer to the resolution.  &#xD;
&#xD;
We advocate more solar energy. We do not advocate for the type of energy you get from a solar panel and not the type which requires the sun.  &#xD;
We defend the solar energy which protrudes from the anus – The Solar Anus – and rest assured that it works.&#xD;
&#xD;
Deleuze and Guattari 72 (Anti-Oedipus, page 1)&#xD;
It is at work everywhere, functioning smoothly at times, at other times in &#xD;
AND&#xD;
Something is produced: the effects of a machine, not mere metaphors.&#xD;
&#xD;
The solar anus produces energy – it works and can be explained theoretically – but it is no final solution.  &#xD;
The Solar Anus is a thought experiment and a machine – a machine which produces new relations to energy and our agency over it.  The Solar Anus is neither beginning nor ending, but a singularity – a rupture against status quo binaries of fossil fuels versus renewable.  &#xD;
We do not affirm existing energy, but rather energy to come.  We affirm the potential of solar energy by reducing the mental restrictions which encompass the status quo. &#xD;
We plant the seeds for new ways of perceiving both energy and ecology as both the outcome and process of a methodological deconstruction and removal of the restrictions which currently limit solar energy.&#xD;

Rhizomatic politics asks us to work on ourselves as much as the world around us.  We do not abandon the coming together of mass movements, but do not require such a method either. We can reduce consumption at the individual level and also form collectives both working against the destructive effects of the energy industry and working towards the creation and establishment of new eco-philosophies.  &#xD;
Pindar and Sutton 2000 (Ian Pindar and Paul Sutton; Translators Introduction to The Three Ecologies.  Pindar reviews regularly for the Guardian, the Times Literary Supplement and the London Review of Books: Sutton is an Ecosophist and has a PhD in ecology; pp. 12-15)&#xD;
Nevertheless, an expenditure of work is necessary in order for us to extend our &#xD;

Being effectively rhizomatic requires the ability to move between particular states and situations by redefining strategy and opposing the calcification of protest.  &#xD;

The 1AC is a performative satire of the current state of debate.  This comic criticism reveals holes and inconsistencies with the logic and form of debate by creating an enthymatic response with the audience.  You should not affirm the literal translation of the 1AC, but rather subtext of the speech.  This method is key to a self-reflexive politics that opens the space for internal criticism
Holcomb 2009 (Justine Schuchard, &amp;#34;In the Culture of Truthiness: Comic Criticism and the Performative Politics of Stephen Colbert&amp;#34; (2009). Communication Theses.Paper 51. SRM)

Burke contends that &amp;#34;the comic frame should enable people to be observers of themselves
AND
and even celebrates those realities (the Doritos sponsorship is a prime example).

 
Our performance reveals and undercuts the tragic framing of the 1AC. The tragic frame blames problems on someone else, creating an us/them dichotomy of problems and solutions.  Instead we begin with critical self reflection as a means of opening up the opportunities presented to us.
Holcomb 2009 (Justine Schuchard, &amp;#34;In the Culture of Truthiness: Comic Criticism and the Performative Politics of Stephen Colbert&amp;#34; (2009). Communication Theses.Paper 51. SRM)

Burke describes differing &amp;#34;frames of acceptance,&amp;#34; by which &amp;#34;we mean the more 
AND
view in search of a dialectical, holistic understanding of problems and opportunities.

 
Specifically, our criticism of status quo discourse on Iran challenges particular forms of knowledge production which make war inevitable. This is not a double turn with the aff – we think the US is not immanently evil either, but perhaps misinformed.  However, when Iran is locked into an objectified villainous position, cereal policy failure is inevitable
Herman and Peterson 2009 (Edward S. Herman is Professor Emeritus of Finance at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. David Peterson is an independent researcher and journalist. “The Construction of the Iran &amp;#34;Threat&amp;#34;: The Iran Versus the U.S.-Israeli-NATO Threats”)

Specifically, we want to investigate two things:
1. The means by which we can activate our agency to engage in sustainable political formations to be ethically ecological.
2. The way desire shapes the political and the social to create restrictions on energy in the status quo.

First: What does it mean to be ethically ecological in the world? For us it is not just an issue of working on oneself but also finding ways to make coalitions effective at changing the consumptive practices which inhabit and mark modernity.  Politics always begins with the self, but it has the capacity to spread horizontally to other groups and coalitions.  Our philosophy of the rhizome would look like this:

Begin with the individual – who am I and how can I change my patterns? What do I do that is unethical to the world around me.  Maybe this starts small – just recently I stopped eating meat. I choose to eat locally produced food when available.  You can ride a bike more, walk more, drive less, carpool, reuse materials, recycle aluminum and glass: all of these are tiny actions but they move in the right direction.  

The truth of the matter is that one individual can likely do VERY LITTLE to resolve ecological catastrophe, but then again, no single person is responsible for the 10 million plastic water bottles in landfills.  Each act is ethical if it moves in the right direction – it’s not the size of the boat but the motion of the ocean – and philosophy, specifically ecophilosophy can remind us WHY we do these things – to keep the world alive, to act responsibly within our spheres of action.  However, rhizomatic politics allows us to go bigger – it provides a blueprint for acting collectively in the world.

You work on yourself as much as you try to work on others - persuading, informing, convincing - combining individual philosophies in new and unique ways to create entirely new ways of being ethical in the world.  

Many different groups have different goals and aspirations.  Save the Whales, Save the rainforests, increase public transportation, bring back the electric car, etc and so on.  All potentially good ecological activities but they in and of themselves do little to change the world as a whole.  So sometimes groups work together – the save the whales and save the rainforests people lobby against a new oil well that hurts both.  The public transportation people work with the electric car people to make light rails. Government programs for subsidized solar energy combine with activists in low-income areas to bring energy to people who otherwise would never have it without bringing the baggage of pollution along with it.  

But sometimes these groups disagree or face roadblocks, but instead of becoming enemies, we argue they should face those roadblocks as a means of entering new modalities of change – when your strategy fails you don’t go home, you find a new tactic and a new effort.  This is a movement opposite many of the problems of capitalism that that allows us to EXCHANGE movements and tactics to further life for the better.
Pindar and Sutton 2000 (Ian Pindar and Paul Sutton; Translators Introduction to The Three Ecologies.  Pindar reviews regularly for the Guardian, the Times Literary Supplement and the London Review of Books: Sutton is an Ecosophist and has a PhD in ecology; pp. 12-15)
Nevertheless, an expenditure of work is necessary in order for us to extend our 
AND
us prey to environmental degradation, we are all stranded on Spaceship Earth.


Localized tactics are preferable to monolithic and singular strategies for engaging the state.  Tactics without a predetermined teleological conclusion allow for infinite revolutionary potential - never drifting along a particular ideological tide, but rather following a loose ethical infrastructure.  Artistic ecology is not an act but a process, bolstered and strengthened by the delay of conclusion, allowing a method which encounters and resonates between tactics in order to grow in strength when experiencing opposition and counter-tactics.  

Pindar and Sutton note the tension between singularity and collective action: It requires that a plurality of disparate groups come together in a kind of unified disunity, a pragmatic solidarity without solidity; what one might call, for want of a better word, &amp;#39;fluidarity&amp;#39;. This &amp;#34;fluidarity&amp;#34; requires a suspension of finality and a refusal of predetermined politics.  We think politics has no unified course of study or action - it doesn&amp;#39;t have to look any which way at all - and breaking free from the insistence of universalized visions of politics is necessary to reinvigorate effective dissensus.
Smith 2010 (Phil, Phil Smith is a UK based artist, performer and teacher, specialising in performance related to walking.  At present he is engaged in research at the University of Plymouth (UK) on the effectiveness of performance and performative interventions in touristic and heritage spaces.&amp;#34;Tourists/Terrorists – Useful Ambiguities in a Search for Models&amp;#34;, Rhizome magazine)

A discussion about models of &amp;#39;ideal&amp;#39;, resistant, small group organisation is generally pre
AND
that some of the most effective policing of geographical power is carried out.

Second: Our politics is conscious of the driving force behind action: Desire.  Desire is everywhere; it eats, it sleeps, it propels us in particular directions.  Desire is neither good nor bad and we not seek to increase or decrease it - rather we seek to recognize desire and where it comes from.  Desire is composed of the little things all around us we may not even be conscious of.  Andrew Ballantyne notes &amp;#34; There are thousands upon thousands of these mechanisms, of which we become aware only as they produce effects that approach the level of consciousness&amp;#34; (&amp;#34;Deleuze and Guattari for Architects&amp;#34;, page 27).  

These investments in desire are not unconscious, they are preconscious - they affect and build what we do unconsciously long before we even realize it is happening.  These fragments and moments compose the rhetorical soup of everyday life
Hart 1994 (Hart, Roderick.  &amp;#34;Doing Criticism My Way: A Reply to Darsey.&amp;#34;  Western Journal of Communication 58 (Fall 1994): 308-312.)
We live in a soup of rhetoric.  One need not be Mikhail Bakhtin or 
AND
and how they make audiences think about some things and not other things.

In a capitalist world marked by social media, internet connections, twitter and facebook and tumblr and reddit and text messages, we are constantly CONSUMING information, fragments, and inputs to our preconscious.  Capitalism tells you that you NEED a new pair of shoes or you just won&amp;#39;t fit it.  Magazines like Cosmo and GQ tell us what we should look like, how to be happy, the recipe for being a person in the world, but no matter how much we outwardly rebel against these messages we never stop consuming them.  We are all of us in line to watch the new Twilight movie so we can talk about how terrible it is, slapping down our $10 ironically - but the true irony is that there is no such thing anymore.  Everything is consumption, and that consumption is DRIVEN by DESIRE.  Desire and its formative messages move us in the direction of consumption by virtue of a positive feedback loop - you are taught to consume so you can better consume messages on how to consume.

Desire begins locally and spreads both horizontally and vertically - reaching out to others on the same plane but also moving up the rung from individual to social group to institutions like the state.  This is why politics must begin at the immediate and immanent point of the self. 
Lambert 2006 (Greg, &amp;#34;Who&amp;#39;s Afraid of Deleuze and Guattari?&amp;#34;)

Is it really the displacement of disguising of a true image of action, or 
AND
a concomitant revolution of on the level of instincts: a molecular revolution!

Desire creates restrictions on energy that are very real.  Desire insists the alternative energy is useful only if fits into a preconceived frame and looks and acts in particular ways.  The dominant models of the status quo locks energy production into an unproductive binary of clean but inefficient solar and wind energy or efficient and dirty coal and oil.  Before we can have any productive discussion on the development of new sources of energy, we need to reconfigure and remake the academic and social practices which generate restrictions.

This speech act happening right now is a counter-investment against the restrictions that inhibit energy discussions in the status quo.  This speech act is not a final solution, but part and parcel of our rhizomatic political method, beginning in the cracks, fissures, and micro-spaces we inhabit, and spreading outward to change dominant epistemological paradigms.  
Tinnell, 11(Department of English, University of Florida, John, The Fibreculture Journal, issue 18 2011, FCJ-121 Transversalising the Ecological Turn: Four Components of Felix Guattari’s Ecosophical Perspective, http://eighteen.fibreculturejournal.org/2011/10/09/fcj-121-transversalising-the-ecological-turn-four-components-of-felix-guattari%E2%80%99s-ecosophical-perspective/)

Energy is restricted through despotic consolidation of magic by representative power. The despot absorbs the energy of others for material resource value - all ideologies obsessed with physical conditions seek that energy, preventing its conjunction with others. Through our sorcery, we may free energy from these controlling restrictions by refusing to be beholden to systems of representation - faith in our spell will breathe life back into untethered thought.&#xD;

Every instance is key to summon the specters around us which have been lost through time. Despots can only control and restrict energies, they cannot create. BY summoning spirits we create another space and time to reduce these restrictions around us. This is because the despot is not a person, but a way of thinking which has no center and can only be resisted by embracing the hermetic quest for power beyond the organism.&#xD;

Deviation from the predictable order is both inevitable and desirably good. If supported, these deviations can transform society and organization as a whole. If denied and controlled, only death can follow.&#xD;

We are magicians, summoning the spirits around us to comprehend what they make of us. Together, spirits, shamans, magicians, witches, and philosophers, we move to immanence as a source of power for sorcery, and through this move, remove restrictions on the production of energy.&#xD;

We affirm the production of energy, unfettered from any restriction of representation. At stake are different modes of organization - the state sponsored regime of the sign confines energy to closed totalities and funnels the power of desire though the despotic Big Other. Shamanism opens these closed loops, freeing energy from restrictions while producing it in new and unexpected ways.&#xD;

All energy exists first and foremost on the body without organs - any system of parts which moves energy towards discernible direction. To speak of wind, solar, nuclear, coal, gas, or oil is to speak of bodies and vice-versa. The question of energy, long before it is materialized by state bodies, is how to decode the master signifiers which restrict power and energy at immanent levels. The body without organs is healthy when it is a source of free play and creativity - however, when one&amp;#39;s experiments get stuck in predictability, the body risks becoming repetitive to the point of death.&#xD;

Deleuze’s thought hearkens back… real virtual potencies.

Debate is a game of thought but it has real effects on our world. What happens here does not stay- we are shaping a method of approaching the world. Our first ethical imperative is to refuse tools of revege like framework as an attempt to become worthy of the events that befall us. Welcome experimentation, reject the search for a perfect division of ground
Ramey 2012 (Hermetic Deleuze, 176-177)

Only thought finds it… in The Logic of Sense.

The Academic and bureaucratic modes of evaluation should not be applied to the Aff, less we be tied to the same modes of thought impact turned by the 1AC
Ramey 2012 (Hermetic Deleuze, p. 23)

Deleuze relates artistic… and revives it.

Perfect predictability is impossible- learning centers on problems which repeat infinity in untld nonidentical methods
Ramey 2012 (Hermetic Deleuze, p. 140)

In this sense… series of iterations.

We are not an abandoning of the body- the form of material bodies comes from thought which determines actualization. Imperceptible mediators- spirits= construct our reality long before matter
Ramey 2012 (Hermetic Deleuze, p. 29)

During the Renaissance… making of gods.
