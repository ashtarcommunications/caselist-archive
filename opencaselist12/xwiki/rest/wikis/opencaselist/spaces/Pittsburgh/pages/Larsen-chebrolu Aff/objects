The United States Supreme Court should rule that Vermont’s ban on hydraulic fracking is unconstitutional on the basis that it is facially discriminatory against interstate commerce as outlined in the dormant commerce clause.
Inherency
Vermont banned Fracking, it is the first state to do so.

Solvency

Gas companies already use the dormant commerce clause to challenge state regulations; a Supreme Court ruling would strengthen their case.

Advantage: Constitutional Conservatism
Interpretations of the Commerce Clause have become confused after the ACA debate.

The conservatives in particular have made a habit or reinterpreting the original meaning of the commerce clause in a calculated agenda to subvert the power of the federal government to regulate interstate commerce.

The key distinction coming from the Obamacare ruling is between activity and inactivity, the idea that congress cannot regulate inactivity supports the right-wing agenda by limiting government’s power.

Advantage: China Trade-off
Natural gas trades off with coal, workable bridge to renewables
 Atlantic SEP 17 2012, 10:42 AM ET

U.S. coal companies looking to export to China in squo because of tradeoff, but this is a last ditch strategy to save a dying industry.

However, even a risk of delay in switching from coal to natural gas risks committing to coal for the next half-century. Our impact has the most immediate time-frame.

Chinese emissions lead to extinction

Aff plan solves three reasons. 
1) The rapid increase in natural gas production means U.S. coal production has dropped sharply and won’t recover for some time, which means the U.S. has less coal to ship China.
Hohmann 2012.Hohmann, George. &amp;#34;Coal producers hurt by takeovers.&amp;#34; Bloomberg News 30 Aug. 2012. Web. 3 Oct. 2012. http://www.dailymail.com/Business/201208290172?page=1andbuild=cache.
2) China models U.S. development in natural gas. Chinese tradeoff is directly correlated to U.S. tradeoff. Plan means Chinese demand for coal drops.

3) China’s coal production is insufficient to fuel itself;coal industry is completely reliant on U.S. imports. Trade-off in U.S. and China shuts down U.S. exports to China.
Plumer 12(Brad Plumer is a reporter focusing on energy and environmental issues. He was previously an associate editor at The New Republic.)“How the U.S. could influence China’s coal habits — with exports” http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/can-the-united-states-influence-chinas-coal-habits/2012/05/01/gIQAgqUpuT_blog.html

With domestic and international supply down, as well as demand, the coal industry will die. It’s dying already, but state bans are a barrier to trade-off. Removing the ban hammers the final nail in the coffin of the coal industry.</headline></objectSummary></objects>
