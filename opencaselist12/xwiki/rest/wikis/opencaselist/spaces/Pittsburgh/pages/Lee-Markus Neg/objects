Framework 1NC 

Interpretation- the judge is not an armchair analyst, but rather a democratic life coach. This means policy making is key 

Figuring politics as therapy undermines public deliberation and critical thinking  in the name of fascist compulsion for war.  We understand trauma as tragic lack which must be consoled to fashion an national identity.

What is striking about … knowledge and critical thinking.

They explode limits- allowing debate to be about things like personal feelings means anything is topical. 
And only switch side debate creates portable policy and ideological change necessary to solve the 1AC by promoting reflexive critical thinking. We have to be able to separate our feelings from the consequences of our actions

INDICT OF LACANIAN PYSCHOANALYSIS K + CP 

Your approach to psychoanalysis and trauma is fundamentally Lacanian and Zizekian
Ali 2005 (Harris, Environmental Studies Prof. at York, “Review of Signs of Danger: Waste, Trauma, and Nuclear Threat” http://www.cjsonline.ca/pdf/signsofdanger.pdf)
The final substantive … they proceed as it were possible)

A strict Lacanian model results in a fundamentally tragic affect: all disagreement is understood as failure
Fraser 1990, American critical theorist, currently the Henry A. and Louise Loeb Professor of Political and Social Science and professor of philosophy (Nancy, “The Uses and Abuses of French Discourse Theories for Feminist Politics,” Boundary 2 17 p. JStor)
The combination of … as inherently tragic.

Your tragic frame is the ULTIMATE form of groupthink, a predetermined consensus that the politics of here and now is defined by nothing more or less than human failure 
Critchley, very trendy postmodernist, 1999  p. 110-111 (Simon, “Comedy and Finitude..” in Constellations)
Moving from the … example of Lacan’s Ethics seminar. 

We’ll outline several implications:

A) their tragic frame operates as a total solvency takeout to the affirmative—their aff is premised on productively sublimating affects through confrontations with trauma—but they don’t meet their own standard—for a tragedian only an epochal and apolcayptic confrontation with the root of trauma can solve—by only addressing one specific instance of hyperarousal they fail to clear their own bar for encountering the root cause of trauma rather than a single proximate cause

B) Magnifies all alternate causality arguments into solvency turns rather than solvency takeouts—any alternate causality for hyperarousal is framed by the aff as a fundamentally tragic encounter with a fixed truth of political reality—this means the return of hyperarousal is not taken as a temporary attitudinal or political mistake but instead as an absolute enunciation of the death drive

C) Tragic framing results in scapegoating and mass violence- comic framing solves by sublimating the system as weak and sensiting the people to its fragility
Carlson, Assist. Comm Prof @ Maryland, 1986 p. EBSCO (Cheree, in Quarterly Journal of Speech “Ghandi and the Comic Frame”)
Recognizing the …  populace to deal with them.

B. A small act of scapegoating is complicit with genocide
Staub, PHD of Trauma @ UMASS, 1989 p. 17 (Ervin, The Roots of Evil)
Blaming others, scapegoating, …  Rouge to power in Cambodia.

CP TEXT:
Thus we advocate that United States Supreme Court should affirm the Third Circuit Court decision in New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection v. United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission. This endorsement should be taken as an act of comic democratic enunciation.
This competes:

A) It&amp;#39;s a fundamentally different plan—your entire 1AC is dedicated to framing arguments about how we need to take up the position of the analyst—our argument is not that you should take the position of the tragic psychoanalyst but instead you should take the role of democratic life coach, endorsing the plan—cx of the 1AC demonstrates that their framework arguments are the intrinsic focus of the debate—how the affirmative is framed and endorsed matters

B) We fundamentally do not agree that despair is foundational—there is no mythic or totally successful political act, but the result of this reasoning should not be to describe despair, but instead to advocate a politics of comic possibility—we are essentially PIC-ing out of the way you foreground the importance of your affirmative—understanding the aff as part of a continuing political project of democratic possibility rather than an epic break with previous political failures

C) At worst you can just reject the do the plan part of our advocacy but still embrace a comic frame to adjudicate the debate—their solvency evidence is terrible, and specific to terrorism but not specific to the relationship between terrorism and trauma—we’d still win the debate

D) We advocate roleplaying an ascent into politics instead of a descent into catastrophe—this PICs out of the framing of the aff—because the plan can’t solve the root cause identified by the 1AC, better to positions ourselves to politics with an attitude that there is more to be done rather than regarding a single Supreme Court decision as messianic
And our comic frame solves all your affect and trauma arguments

Tragic orientation is inferior—story of trauma’s inevitability limits politics to a melancholic search for a pure space outside trauma—embrace the affirmative through a lens of comedy to enable democratic sublimation and avoid ritualistic scapegoating
McDaniel 2000 (James, former associate Professor of Rhetoric at UC-Boulder, “Fantasm: The Triumph of Form” Quarterly Journal of Speech 86.1)

CASE

Your pessimistic take on modern democracy destroys sociality and politics—your tragic apprehensions destroy politics and your theory of “hyperarousal” participates in the worst sort of reductionist affective work—you reduce all democracy to trauma

The harms presented by the AFF are selected and framed in order to justify a modern mode of technical control, and they make sense only insofar as we think of life as instrumental.  The techno-instrumental ordering in the 1AC can only result in one conclusion: eclipse of being in the name of curbing the undesirable effects of technology.  The AFF totalizes instrumentality as the only acceptable mode of political intervention.  This is ontological genocide.

And thus our alt, a poem by Holderlin:
When I was a boy
A god often rescued me
From the shouts and the rods of men
And I played among trees and flowers
Secure in their kindness
And the breezes of heaven
Were playing there too.
And as you delight
The hearts of plants
When they stretch towards you
With little strength
So you delighted the heart in me
Father Helios, and like Endymion
I was your favourite,
Moon. 0 all
You friendly
And faithful gods
I wish you could know
How my soul has loved you.
Even though when I called to you then
It was not yet with names, and you
Never named me as people do
As though they knew one another
I knew you better
Than I have ever known them.
I understood the stillness above the sky
But never the words of men.
Trees were my teachers
Melodious trees
And I learned to love
Among flowers.
I grew up in the arms of the gods.

A. Our interpretation is that the Affirmative must have an advocacy statement that defends topical action
Contention 1: Resolutional Focus
Subpoint A - Theory
1) Predictability: non-literal interpretations of the topic make the resolution functionally meaningless.  The resolution loses its ability to serve as a guide for neg research.  
2) Kills neg ground- lack of plan makes it impossible to have competitive counterplans or test the merits of the particular outcome of the aff advocacy.  Absent resolutional action the only way for fair neg ground would be to frame the debate as a question of competing methodologies
3) Moving target- without a stable plan text, the affirmative can dodge our 1nc by reinterpreting what their advocacy is, plan focus is essential for stable and fair division of ground.
4) Topical version – they could have given incentives to natives for wind power and then reinterpret wind according to the position of indigenous peoples. Solvency advocates do exist, Mark Shahinian, and argue this is key to native sovereignty
4) This isn’t a policy good argument, this is a debate good argument. Their advocacy destroys debate.
Subpoint B – Tyranny of the Self 
TYRANNY OF THE SELF- RATHER THAN RISK INSERTING ONESSELF INTO THE LIBERATORY STRUCTURE ONLY TO BE OPPRESSED BY ONES OWN FAILURE, WE MUST ACCEPT THE STRATEGY OF THE MASSES. THE TYRANNY OF THE SELF THEIR PROJECT ESTABLISHES IS QUALITATIVELY WORSE THAN BEING OPPRESSED BY THE POWERS THAT BE.

In response to this potentially catastrophic situation constructed by our own hubris and chosen ignorance of the universe, Georges Bataille presents us with two modes of expenditure to choose from in exerting our excess- the glorious and the catastrophic. Glorious expenditure entails things like art, music, sex, dancing, all activities not considered productive by utility based dogmatism. Catastrophic expenditure includes weapons buildup and environmental destruction. Action NOT reorientation or thinking is the key to make change in the world.

Eliminating the theoretical restriction on energy begins the process of glorious expenditure that allows us to reclaim our lives from focusing on working jobs we hate to buy shit we don’t need and instead allowing our creative energies to overflow and consume us.

The marriage of heaven and hell provides the optimal metaphor for putting the shit back in the sacred as a challenge to the scientific rationality that rules society at large and the debate space. Blake challenges the separation of the natural body from the rational part of existence and glorifies the ecstatic use of energy instead of its conservation 
All Bibles or sacred codes have been the causes of the following Errors.
Man has two real existing principles Viz: a Body and a Soul.
2. That Energy, call&amp;#39;d Evil, is alone from the Body, and that Reason, call&amp;#39;d Good, is alone from the Soul.
3. That God will torment Man in Eternity for following his Energies.
But the following Contraries to these are True
Man has no Body distinct from his Soul for that call&amp;#39;d Body is a portion of Soul discern&amp;#39;d by the five Senses, the chief inlets of Soul in this age
2. Energy is the only life and is from the Body and Reason is the bound or outward circumference of Energy.
3 ENERGY IS ETERNAL DELIGHT
Blake explores the notion of duality in The Argument. He challenges the passivity associated with the obsession with reason, productivity and divinity. 
Without contraries, is no progression. Attraction and Repulsion, Reason and Energy, Love and Hate, are necessary to Human existence.
 From these contraries spring what the religious call Good and Evil. Good is the passive that obeys Reason. Evil is the Active springing from Energy. 
 Good is Heaven. Evil is Hell…</headline></objectSummary><objectSummary><link rel="http://www.xwiki.org/rel/object" href="http://opencaselist.paperlessdebate.com/xwiki/rest/wikis/opencaselist/spaces/Pittsburgh/pages/Lee-Markus%20Neg/objects/Admin.EntryClass/7"/><link rel="http://www.xwiki.org/rel/properties" href="http://opencaselist.paperlessdebate.com/xwiki/rest/wikis/opencaselist/spaces/Pittsburgh/pages/Lee-Markus%20Neg/objects/Admin.EntryClass/7/properties"/><id>opencaselist:Pittsburgh.Lee-Markus Neg:42181ef8-44bb-4c5c-be13-39aea8cb912d</id><guid>42181ef8-44bb-4c5c-be13-39aea8cb912d</guid><pageId>opencaselist:Pittsburgh.Lee-Markus Neg</pageId><wiki>opencaselist</wiki><space>Pittsburgh</space><pageName>Lee-Markus Neg</pageName><className>Admin.EntryClass</className><number>7</number><headline>CP- PIC OUT OF THE STATE

Your tragic frame is the ULTIMATE form of groupthink, a predetermined consensus that the politics of here and now is defined by nothing more or less than human failure

We’ll outline several implications:
A) their tragic frame operates as a total solvency takeout to the affirmative—their aff is premised on productively sublimating affects through confrontations with trauma—but they don’t meet their own standard—for a tragedian only an epochal and apolcayptic confrontation with the root of trauma can solve—by only addressing one specific instance of hyperarousal they fail to clear their own bar for encountering the root cause of trauma rather than a single proximate cause
B) Magnifies all alternate causality arguments into solvency turns rather than solvency takeouts—any alternate causality for hyperarousal is framed by the aff as a fundamentally tragic encounter with a fixed truth of political reality—this means the return of hyperarousal is not taken as a temporary attitudinal or political mistake but instead as an absolute enunciation of the death drive
C) Tragic framing results in scapegoating and mass violence- comic framing solves by sublimating the system as weak and sensiting the people to its fragility

CP TEXT:
Thus we advocate that United States Supreme Court should affirm the Third Circuit Court decision in New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection v. United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission. This endorsement should be taken as an act of comic democratic enunciation.
This competes:
A) It&amp;#39;s a fundamentally different plan—your entire 1AC is dedicated to framing arguments about how we need to take up the position of the analyst—our argument is not that you should take the position of the tragic psychoanalyst but instead you should take the role of democratic life coach, endorsing the plan—cx of the 1AC demonstrates that their framework arguments are the intrinsic focus of the debate—how the affirmative is framed and endorsed matters
B) We fundamentally do not agree that despair is foundational—there is no mythic or totally successful political act, but the result of this reasoning should not be to describe despair, but instead to advocate a politics of comic possibility—we are essentially PIC-ing out of the way you foreground the importance of your affirmative—understanding the aff as part of a continuing political project of democratic possibility rather than an epic break with previous political failures
C) At worst you can just reject the do the plan part of our advocacy but still embrace a comic frame to adjudicate the debate—their solvency evidence is terrible, and specific to terrorism but not specific to the relationship between terrorism and trauma—we’d still win the debate
D) We advocate roleplaying an ascent into politics instead of a descent into catastrophe—this PICs out of the framing of the aff—because the plan can’t solve the root cause identified by the 1AC, better to positions ourselves to politics with an attitude that there is more to be done rather than regarding a single Supreme Court decision as messianic
And our comic frame solves all your affect and trauma arguments
Tragic orientation is inferior—story of trauma’s inevitability limits politics to a melancholic search for a pure space outside trauma—embrace the affirmative through a lens of comedy to enable democratic sublimation and avoid ritualistic scapegoating
