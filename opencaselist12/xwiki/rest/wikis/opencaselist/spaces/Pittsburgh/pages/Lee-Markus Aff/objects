The sun shits energy in all directions, but contemporary modes of thought wish to restrict its flows to serve the regime of utility. Restricted economics prevail. For now. 
Igrek 9 (Apple, prof of Philosophy @ Seattle University) “Modes of Luxurious Walking”  Postmodern Culture v. 20 #1 Sept. 2009. Project Muse. 
Any discussion of-instances of expenditure&amp;#34; (53).
The refusal to conceptualize of energy as overflowing and without limits constitutes an attitudinal restriction on the production and use of solar energy in the status quo.
Stoekl 2007 (Allan, Professor of French and Comparative Literature at Penn State University. “Bataille’s Peak: Energy, Religion, and Postsustainability.” P. 148-149)
Bataille’s energy is-individual identity—sacrifice.
Even the resolution calls us to a scientific, utility-based notion of energy that is by its very nature restricted. We are called to feed the massive grid of stored energy that is only waiting to be put to work. This constitutes the largest restriction on solar energy in the status quo. Energy is best understood in opposition to this closed economy. Understanding the relation between human activity and the biosphere is a prerequisite to challenging utility 
Vanderburg 8 (Willem, prof of Civil/Environmental Engineering @ U of Toronto) “The Most Economically Viable, and Environmentally Sustainable Alternative Energy” pg. 99-100
The successes and- energy end-use. 
The closed form of energy economics has colonized the sciences and produced a flawed set of justifications to permit its foreclosure. The debate community at large in the topic discussion elevates science to the level of divinity and disallows an authentic investigation of energy that recognizes the inability of its limitation and its interaction with human activity 
Schwarz and Nordmann 11 (Astrid senior researcher at the Technische Universitat Darmstadt and the University of Basel, Alfred prof of philosophy @ Darmstadt university and Centenary prof @ U of SC) “The Political Economy of Technoscience” 2011. Pg. 320-322 
This reliance of- better or worse.

In response to this potentially catastrophic situation constructed by our own hubris and chosen ignorance of the universe, Georges Bataille presents us with two modes of expenditure to choose from in exerting our excess- the glorious and the catastrophic. Glorious expenditure entails things like art, music, sex, dancing, all activities not considered productive by utility based dogmatism. Catastrophic expenditure includes weapons buildup and environmental destruction 
Bataille 91 (Georges. The Accursed Share. P. 21. Translated by Robert Hurley)
Human&amp;#39;s disregard for- gloriously or catastrophically

CONTENTION TWO: IT ALL COMES BACK TO FIRE AND SHIT 
We must depart from the closed economy that seeks to subordinate energy to the role of mechanized work. Thus, we affirm the elimination of the restriction on energy production imposed by the closed economy of the resolution. 
A closed energy economy is contingent on the limited universe of God which seeks to reign in the energies of sin. Although religion seeks to create an austere vision of human subjectivity, it justifies the destruction of the natural world. The earth was conferred upon humanity by God to use and dispose of as we saw fit. Only a challenge to the unimpeachable authority of God has the capacity to solve
Stoekl 2007 (Allan, Professor of French and Comparative Literature at Penn State University) “Bataille’s Peak: Energy, Religion, and Postsustainability.” P.150
In this chapter-put to use 
William Blake’s marriage of heaven and hell provides the optimal text for an assault on the divine. He champions the exuberance of the body and his own notion of intimate expenditure that preferred “sensual happiness” to an austere subject.  This sensual happiness violates the taboos of a closed economy of morality. Blake’s equation of Energy with Evil gives us an opportunity to understand a Bataillean Ethic- we should not Turn away from Evil-we should rather look it in the face. 
Bataille 57 (Georges, French pervert) Literature and Evil pg. 70-72 
Chaos can be-evil to be 
The marriage of heaven and hell provides the optimal metaphor for putting the shit back in the sacred as a challenge to the scientific rationality that rules society at large and the debate space. Blake challenges the separation of the natural body from the rational part of existence and glorifies the ecstatic use of energy instead of its conservation

Marriage of Heaven and Hell by William Blake. 
Blake later warns us of the ills of forgetting the dual nature of the universe. Society at large mimics the movement of the human body. The production of positivity with the end of removing all negative elements leads to cancer and certifies its own death. The energy the system has cast out will return in the form of destruction 
Baudrillard 93 (Jean, The Transparency of Evil; Essays on Extreme Phenomena.  Translated by James Benedict. Verso  London – New York.  Page 106)
The uninterrupted production- the accursed share
Literature provides the optimal form of intimate expenditure by resisting the imposition of a closed economy. The media forms the message. Language is by its very nature heterological and stands opposed to the restricted economy due to the infinite meanings that can be derived from each word. Our interpretation of energy is the excess to the linguistic closed economy of the resolution
Botting and Wilson ‘01 (Fred and Scott. Bataille. P. 50-52)
As writing expands-to pose questions.  
CONTENTION THREE: THE GIFTS OF INTIMATE EXPENDITURE 
The body itself forms the excess to a closed system of politics that only values the institution of governance as the one in D.C. Just as Blake challenged the separation and prohibition of bodily energy from rationality, we must acknowledge the excess of the body politic that constitutes the uncontrollable energies that cannot fit into the cramped and sterile white halls of congress.  This disallows inner experience by forcing it into the world of work, making it impossible to reclaim the value to our lives. We can only achieve real sovereignty by confronting our fear of death. Only intimate expenditure allows for this contestation to occur
Hansen and Stepputat 5 (Thomas, Finn) Sovereign Bodies: Citizens, Migrants, and States in the Postcolonial World 
First, we suggest- on human bodies.
Further, Solutions to the contemporary climate crisis will be better served by a joyous squandering of energy than a grand visionary project targeted at institutional change 
Clark 10 (Nigel, Senior Lecturer at Nottingham-Trent U) “Volatile Worlds, “Vulnerable Bodies : Confronting Abrupt Climate Change” 2010 27: 31 Theory Culture Society 
There are more- here and now.
Eliminating the theoretical restriction on energy begins the process of glorious expenditure that allows us to reclaim our lives from focusing on working jobs we hate to buy shit we don’t need and instead allowing our creative energies to overflow and consume us. This type of expenditure is necessary in the process of confronting our own death. Reconciling our existence as limited to being carriers of energy is key to value to life.

Intimate expenditure solves- it undercuts the notion of exchange value by producing shit that is unusable to capitalism. Without exchange value based on utility in value there can be no capitalism. We retake production.

Perm: do both. Their attempt to focus exclusively on materiality ignores a litany of other methods and modes of inquiry.

We don’t provide any assistance to whiteness.

2. Turn-
A. Rediscovering our humanity-All whiteness is rooted in the exclusion of useless expenditure. Only case has a chance to solve by embracing it insead of trying to exorcize it. These activities connect us to our humanity and make us more caring and genuine people. Only by doing the shit we love instead of constantly being tethered to the world of work has the capacity to solve by making us more human

B. The body-Our challenge to the bodily notion of perfection and productivity challenges the false neutrality of the liberal subject that lies at the root of all whiteness and oppression. The assumed equal access to everything is true of “neutral” white, straight, Christian, male bodies but excludes all that fall outside this “ideal” conception of the body. Case also has the effect of challenging the concept of limits with our reading of general economics. These limits demarcate personal property as only usable by the person to whom it belongs. It allows for fear of “encroachment” to lead to overt bigotry such as white flight. Only case can solve this apathy and challenge the notion of a neutral subject

We must continue -fundamental structures of phallicized white-  ness. 
C. demarcation-Our challenge to the limitations on the status quo in the form of energy incentives, conception of society and debate all are challenges to the basis of whiteness. Limitation and demarcation are how the logics of whiteness are exercised.

D. The heterological community-Only the aff’s conception of a heterological community has the capacity to solve. All violence Is underwritten by distinctive sub units of society. Allegiance to faith, nation, gender, sexuality, race, these allegiances prevent a universal community of the heterological and reconceptualizes community as a verb instead of a noun. Only the aff prevents an inversion of the binary that their alternative guarantees

The &amp;#34;Programme” begins - rather than utopian
1.	They cant solve the external impacts- 
 Value to life- Their strategy is not widely adoptable to all parts of society whereas ours has the ability to create positive change in the lives of people all over the world and throughout society. Allowing for a reconnection with the energies of the earth and self means we can experience all of the best parts of life and not feel guilty. That’s the Sorenson evidence. 
4. Their alt can’t solve. Allowing a subordinated view of energy to prevail guarantees the continuation of oppression. Focusing on energy provides a way to recontextualize power relations and is a prerequisite to revolutionary action

5. Your attempt to demarcate a space between our two projects is part and parcel of the system of whiteness. We agree on 90% of what’s wrong about this world but you seek to cannibalize our movement for the advancement of your own. This demarcation and competition is part and parcel of whiteness. The only way to challenge whiteness is to embrace a litany of struggles and educational opportunities against the system

6. The search for utopia created happiness tradeoffs, all oppression is underwritten by the desire to remake the world for ourselves and those similar to us. Inner experience solves by forcing a psychological challenge to our notion of the good and resolving the question of catastrophic expenditure. Neoliberal and racialized discourses only cloak oppression in liberally justified discourses. Case solves the root cause. Alt can’t challenge all oppression
