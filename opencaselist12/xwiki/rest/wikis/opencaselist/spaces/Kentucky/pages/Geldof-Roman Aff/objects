This dual stance is attributable to the business decisions made by China’s NOCs.

U.S. massive response – a potential “Armageddon” scenario.

===Inherency ===

====Contention 1- the Status Quo====

====The United States currently submits all foreign investment deals related to oil and gas production to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, known as CFIUS.  These restrictions chill foreign investment and send a signal of US protectionism. ====
**Wilson Center 5-31-12** (Chinese Investment in North American Energy, http://www.wilsoncenter.org/event/chinese-investment-north-american-energy)
While Chinese foreign energy investment is on the rise, the more notable story is 
AND
companies, which will allow China~’s companies to better extract resources at home.

====Contention 2- Investment====

====Scenario 1- Protectionism:====

====Global trade is on the brink of collapse- rising US protectionism risks global escalation. ====
**Lincicome 12** (Scott, trade attorney, &amp;#34;Is Missing American Trade Leadership Beginning to Bear Protectionist Fruit? (Hint: Kinda Looks Like It),&amp;#34; June 12,  http://lincicome.blogspot.com/2012/06/is-missing-american-trade-leadership.html)
Over the past few years, I and several other US trade-watchers have 
AND
its long-held place at the front of the trade liberalization pack.


====And, restrictions on oil and gas investments explode the scope of foreign investment CFIUS reviews.  This expansion of the CFIUS process is a protectionist tool to keep out investment.====

II. Post 9/11 Application of Exon-Florio After 9/11
AND
that Reagan threatened to veto in order to strip the economic security provisions.

====And, expanding the scope of CFIUS reviews undermines US trade leadership and triggers retaliation. The impact is global wars.====
**Carroll-Emory International Law Review-09**       (James, COMMENT: BACK TO THE FUTURE: REDEFINING THE FOREIGN INVESTMENT AND NATIONAL SECURITY ACT~’S CONCEPTION OF NATIONAL SECURITY, 23 Emory Int~’l L. Rev. 167)

C. Economic Retaliation as a Result of CFIUS Protectionism Continued use of Exon-
AND
own interests to take any action that may destabilize the American economy. 182

====And, protectionism sparks great power conflict and exacerbates all global problems.====
**Patrick, Senior Fellow-CFR, 09** (Stewart, senior fellow and director of the Program on International Institutions and Global Governance at the Council on Foreign Relations, &amp;#34;Protecting Free Trade,&amp;#34; National Interest, March 13, 2009, http://nationalinterest.org/article/protecting-free-trade-3060?page=show)
President Obama has committed to working with U.S. trade partners to avoid 
AND

====And, Unilateral FDI liberalization is key to prevent trade policy backsliding which dooms global economic recovery.====
**Erixon and Sally, directors-ECIPE, 10** (Fredrik and Razeen, European Centre for International Political Economy, TRADE, GLOBALISATION AND EMERGING PROTECTIONISM SINCE THE CRISIS, http://www.ecipe.org/media/publication_pdfs/trade-globalisation-and-emerging-protectionism-since-the-crisis.pdf)    ~~italics are from original source~~ We think Mr. Bentham~’s world-view will cause damage, not only to domestic economies but also to the world trading system. This will not be a replay of the 1930s, but a replay of the 1970s is a serious prospect. The world is in danger of undoing the market reforms of the 1980s and ~’90s that brought unprecedented prosperity, especially to emerging markets outside the West. Like the 1970s, policy backsliding could prolong a severe downturn and compromise eventual recovery. The short-term challenge is to arrest the slide to Big Government at home and creeping protectionism abroad. The medium-term challenge is to get back on track with trade and FDI liberalisation combined with domestic structural reforms – substantial &amp;#34;unﬁnished business&amp;#34; left before the crisis struck. More, not less, markets and globalisation are what the world needs. That is primarily a matter for unilateral action by governments and competitive emulation among them. It can be reinforced by international policy cooperation in the WTO, G20 and other fora, but not too much can be expected of cumbersome global-governance mechanisms. Overall, limits to government intervention and a well-functioning market economy are of a piece with open markets, economic globalisation and international political stability.



====Scenario 2- Economic Collapse:====

====And, energy restrictions destroy investor confidence, which crushes the dollar and triggers economic recession- the vague CFIUS interpretation of national security chills ALL foreign investment.====
**Carroll-Emory International Law Review-09**       (James, COMMENT: BACK TO THE FUTURE: REDEFINING THE FOREIGN INVESTMENT AND NATIONAL SECURITY ACT~’S CONCEPTION OF NATIONAL SECURITY, 23 Emory Int~’l L. Rev. 167)
B. National Security and Investor Uncertainty The uncertain interpretation of national security in Exon
AND
investment is more vital than ever to provide liquidity to American markets. 164


====We~’re on the brink of a double dip recession- boosting investor confidence is key.====
**Rickards, 12** (James, economist and investment banker with 35 years of experience working in capital markets on Wall Street and the author of NYT Bestselling book Currency Wars: The Making of the Next Global Crisis, &amp;#34;Why We Should Still Be Worried about a Double-Dip Recession,&amp;#34; February 27, 2012, http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/economic-intelligence/2012/02/27/why-we-should-still-be-worried-about-a-double-dip-recession)

http://www.bfna.org/sites/default/files/publications/Cash%20in%20Hand%20Second%20Edition%20final.pdf)
Although Chinese FDI has drawn increasing attention in the U.S. and Germany
AND
in bringing those countries that are facing a credit crunch back to growth. 



====Contention 3 Is Iran====

====Lack of Chinese support for Iran sanctions undercuts international pressure.  Removing restrictions on Chinese investment in US oil and gas production is the best way to get them to come around.====
**Downs, China fellow at Brookings, 7-19-12** (Erica S. Downs is a fellow at the John L. Thorton China Center at The Brookings Institution, &amp;#34;Getting China to Turn on Iran,&amp;#34; July 19, http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/getting-china-turn-iran-7215)

Over the past decade, as the United States employed increasingly robust sanctions to gradually 
AND
the greater the chance they will think twice about doing business in Iran.
The Chinese government responded to the new U.S. sanctions signed into law 
AND
This dual stance is attributable to the business decisions made by China~’s NOCs.


====And, China is key- their cooperation is the lynchpin of international pressure on Iran nuclearization.====
**Downs, China fellow at Brookings, 11** (Erica S. Downs is a fellow at the John L. Thorton China Center at The Brookings Institution, &amp;#34;Getting China to Sanction Iran,&amp;#34; Foreign Affairs, March/April 2011, http://www.brookings.edu/research/articles/2011/02/03-china-iran-downs-maloney)

For more than three decades, the United States has tried to persuade the international 
AND
that exist between Beijing and Tehran despite their strong ideological and commercial links. 


====Two impacts- First- Nuclearization—====

====Iranian nuclearization makes nuclear war inevitable in the Middle East- even small conflicts could escalate to all out war. ====
**Kahl, Senior Fellow, the Center for a New American Security, 12** (Colin, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for the Middle East and Senior Fellow, the Center for a New American Security,  Iran and the Bomb, Foreign Affairs; Sep/Oct2012, Vol. 91 Issue 5, p157-162)

====Iranian nuclearization causes regional and global arms racing.====
**Cirincione 06** (Joseph, Sr. Assoc. %26 Director @ the Non-Proliferation Project @ the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Summer, SAIS Review, &amp;#34;A New Non-Proliferation Strategy&amp;#34;)
The danger posed by the acquisition of nuclear weapons by Iran or North Korea is 
AND
decade-compounded by the existing political and territorial disputes still unresolved.4


====This risks global nuclear conflict- new prolif risks theft, unauthorized use, terrorism, and crisis escalation. ====

====Sanctions work- evidence suggests they will bring Iran back to the negotiating table.====
**Kahl 12** (Colin, Senior Fellow at the Center for a New American Security, Not Time to Attack Iran, Foreign Affairs, 00157120, Mar/Apr2012, Vol. 91, Issue 2)
 In making the case for preventive war as the least bad option, Kroenig 
AND
emphasize that all options, including military action, remain on the table.


====Second impact- Strikes-====
**Israel will strike Iran unless the US gets support for tighten sanctions on Iran- officials statements say they will strike by the end of the year. **
**The International Herald Tribune 9/1/**12 HEADLINE: Atomic report puts Israel in bind; As Iran draws closer to a red line, Netanyahu finds options are narrow BYLINE: JODI RUDOREN and DAVID E. SANGER
For Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, the International Atomic Energy Agency has offered 
AND

====And, tightening sanctions on Iranian oil staves off an Israeli strike on Iran.====
**National Journal 12** (Sara Sorcher, Insiders: New Sanctions on Iran Stave Off Need for Military Action, Jan 31, http://www.nationaljournal.com/nationalsecurity/insiders-new-sanctions-on-iran-stave-off-need-for-military-action-20120130)

Iran~’s response to what would initially start as a sustained stand-off bombardment (
AND
U.S. massive response – a potential &amp;#34;Armageddon&amp;#34; scenario.


====Chinese support for sanctions is the best bet to prevent Israel from striking. ====
**Wuthnow 12** (Joel, fellow at the China and the World Program at the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton University, Will China Stop Iran?, March 05, http://thediplomat.com/2012/03/05/will-china-stop-iran/)
What might China be asked to do? During Vice President Xi Jinping~’s visit to 
AND
and all the strife that would entail – may well be much worse.


====Contention 4 is Chinese Gas ====

====China is currently limiting itself to minority, &amp;#34;hands off&amp;#34; oil and gas deals out of fear of another Unocal—these small partnerships fail to secure the necessary technical expertise needed to develop Chinese shale, putting them decades behind their gas targets. ====
**Mandel 7-17** (Jenny, Reporter for EnergyWire, a daily publication covering the unconventional oil and gas sectors, Previous positions with E%26E include editing Land Letter and writing news and feature stories for Greenwire, ClimateWire, and other news outlets, &amp;#34;Will U.S. shale technology make the leap across the Pacific?,&amp;#34; EnergyWire: Tuesday, July 17, 2012, http://www.eenews.net/public/energywire/2012/07/17/1)

**Knowledge @ Wharton 12** (China~’s Underground Race for Shale Gas, aug 21, http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/arabic/article.cfm?articleid=2851)

Meanwhile, in the U.S., shale gas leaders, such as Devon 
AND
Chinese companies may be able to negotiate better terms, says CATF~’s Sung.


====Only the US has the expertise necessary for China to develop its shale resources- increased Chinese access to US drilling techniques and regulatory methods is critical.====
**Forbes, manager- Shale Gas Initiative at the World Resources Institute, 12** (Sarah, also the Senior Associate for the Climate and Energy Program at the World Resources Institute, HEARING BEFORE THE U.S.-CHINA ECONOMIC AND SECURITY REVIEW COMMISSION: &amp;#34;CHINA~’S GLOBAL QUEST FOR RESOURCES AND IMPLICATIONS FOR THE UNITED STATES; CHINA~’S PROSPECTS FOR SHALE GAS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR THE U.S.,&amp;#34; January 26, http://pdf.wri.org/testimony/forbes_testimony_china_shale_gas_2012-01-26.pdf)
Are there risks as well as opportunities for U.S. companies? From 
AND
aware of and take into account while pursuing and designing Chinese domestic development. 


====Chinese shale development key to displace their coal use—renewables cant be scaled up fast enough. ====
**Hanger 12** (John, Special Counsel at the law firm Eckert Seamans, and former Secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection and Commissioner of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, &amp;#34;China Gets Cracking on Fracking: The Best Environmental News Of The Year?,&amp;#34;  Aug 14,  http://johnhanger.blogspot.com/2012/08/china-gets-cracking-on-fracking-good.html)

China sits on natural gas reserves that are estimated to be 50% higher than the massive gas reserves in the USA. http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/energy/2012/08/120808-china-shale-gas/. Despite this gargantuan gas resource, coal provides China 80% of its electricity, compared to 34% in the USA, as of May 2012. Why the difference? The shale gas boom that is now more than 10 years long in the USA is just getting started in China and so the Chinese remain heavily reliant on coal to make electricity and for their total energy. Around the world, the basic energy choice is coal or gas. China is just the biggest example of this fundamental fact. China~’s reliance on coal means that its economic growth brings skyrocketing carbon emissions and other air pollution. Indeed, Chinese air quality is infamous around the world, and smog has been so thick that Beijing airport has been unable to land planes for short periods. As of 2011, China was responsible for 29% of the world~’s carbon emissions, while the US produced 16%, even though the US economy is still considerably bigger than China~’s. Moreover, US carbon emissions are declining to 1992 levels, but China~’s emissions skyrocket. Though China is building substantial new wind, solar, and nuclear generation, those investments are not enough to cut Chinese coal consumption, given economic growth that is still 7% in what some describe as an economic slowdown. Shale gas, however, could be big enough to actually displace significant amounts of coal in China. More gas in China means less mercury, soot. lead, smog, and carbon emissions. China~’s energy plans call for shale gas to provide 6% of its total energy as soon as 2020.  If it achieves that goal, China will avoid more than 500 million tons of carbon pollution per year or about 1.5% of today~’s total carbon emissions.


====Increasing demand for Chinese coal production causes water shortages which threaten economic collapse and political instability. ====
**Schneider 11** (Keith, senior editor for Circle of Blue-a nonprofit focusing on resource shortages founded in 2000, Choke Point: China—Confronting Water Scarcity and Energy Demand in the World~’s Largest Country, Feb 15, http://www.circleofblue.org/waternews/2011/world/choke-point-china%E2%80%94confronting-water-scarcity-and-energy-demand-in-the-world%E2%80%99s-largest-country/)
By any measure, conventional and otherwise, China~’s tireless advance to international economic prominence 
AND
rising incomes and improving opportunities, is at risk, say some authorities.


====Chinese economic collapse causes Asian and Middle East conflict- China will turn outwardly aggressive.====
**Newmeyer 09 **DR. JACQUELINE NEWMYER - LONG TERM STRATEGY GROUP- THE CENTER FOR NATIONAL POLICY &amp;#34;ECONOMIC CRISIS: IMPACT ON CHINESE MILITARY MODERNIZATION&amp;#34; APRIL 8, 2009, http://cnponline.org/index.php?ht=a/GetDocumentAction/i/12503
 So I think either way, either because of the insecurity that is stoked 
AND
the downturn would lead to a greater chance of conflict abroad for China.


====And, economic decline causes war.====
**Royal 2010  **Jedediah, Director of Cooperative Threat Reduction at the U.S. Department of Defense, &amp;#34;Economic Integration, Economic Signaling and the Problem of Economic Crises,&amp;#34; in Economics of War and Peace: Economic, Legal and Political Perspectives, ed. Goldsmith and Brauer, pg. 213-215
Less intuitive is how periods of economic decline may increase the likelihood of extern conflict
AND
not featured prominently in the economic-security debate and deserves more attention.

====And, pollution from coal causes environmental protests that threaten CCP rule. ====
**LeVine 12** (Steve, author of The Oil and the Glory, Foreign Policy contributor,  CHINA The Cost of Coal , The Weekly Wrap — Aug. 3, 2012, http://oilandglory.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/08/03/the_weekly_wrap_aug_3_2012_part_i-http://oilandglory.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/08/03/the_weekly_wrap_aug_3_2012_part_i)

China~’s moment of coal truth: A question that has vexed us for some time 
AND
and economic outcomes. And yet that is exactly what we are seeing.


====Those pollution protests causes Chinese instability and CCP lashout====
**Nankivell 05** (Nathan, Senior Researcher @ Office of the Special Advisor Policy, Maritime Forces Pacific Headquarters, Canadian Department of National Defence, China~’s Pollution and the Threat to Domestic and Regional Stability, China Brief Vol: 5 Issue: 22, http://www.jamestown.org/programs/chinabrief/single/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=3904%26tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=195%26no_cache=1)

As the impact of pollution on human health becomes more obvious and widespread, it

====This causes the CCP to launch WMDs and kill billions to try to hold onto power ====
**Renxin 05 **Renxin, Journalist, 8-3-2K5 (San, &amp;#34;CCP Gambles Insanely to Avoid Death,&amp;#34; Epoch Times, www.theepochtimes.com/news/5-8-3/30931.html)
Since the Party~’s life is &amp;#34;above all else,&amp;#34; it would not be surprising 
AND
as something one finds difficult to tell whether it is false or true. 


====And, Chinese pollution causes nuclear war with Russia====
**Nankivell 05** (Nathan, Senior Researcher @ Office of the Special Advisor Policy, Maritime Forces Pacific Headquarters, Canadian Department of National Defence, China~’s Pollution and the Threat to Domestic and Regional Stability, China Brief Vol: 5 Issue: 22, http://www.jamestown.org/programs/chinabrief/single/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=3904%26tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=195%26no_cache=1)

In addition to the concerns already mentioned, pollution, if linked to a specific 
AND
in full-scale war between two powerful, nuclear-equipped nations. 


====And, shale development key to Chinese energy security. ====
Downs 00 (Erica, China Fellow @ Brookings, CHINA~’S ENERGY SECURITY ACTIVITIES, http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/monograph_reports/MR1244/MR1244.ch3.pdf)

The Chinese government can also improve China~’s energy security through development of the country~’s natural 
AND
concerns—possibly a fear of foreign control over China~’s gas resources. 76


The impact is China-India energy wars.
**Clement 12** (Nicholas, China and India Vie for Energy Security, May 25, http://www.2point6billion.com/news/2012/05/25/china-and-india-vie-for-energy-security-11177.html)

The competitive relationship between China and India has become a defining feature of the strategic 
AND
ongoing diplomatic engagement between China and India to avoid unnecessary or accidental escalation.


Participating in oil joint ventures boosts US-China energy coop, allowing them to learn from us and control air pollution and environmental degradation.
**Wu, Brookings Visiting Fellow, 08** (Richard Weixing Hu, Advancing Sino-U.S. Energy Cooperation Amid Oil Price Hikes, March, http://www.brookings.edu/research/opinions/2008/03/energy-hu)
Fourth, both governments should encourage their energy companies to collaborate in jointly enlarging the 
AND
air and a considerable contribution to the common course of global environmental protection.


And, politicization of Chinese energy deals independently undermines US-China energy relations, which causes hostile Chinese naval modernization.
**Lieberthal and Herberg 06** (Kenneth, Distinguished Fellow and Director for China at The William Davidson institute, and research associate of the China Center at the University of Michigan,  and Mikkal, Director of the asian Energy security program at The national bureau of asian research, China~’s Search for Energy Security: Implications for U.S. Policy*, http://www.nbr.org/publications/nbranalysis/pdf/vol17no1.pdf)
Both the United States and China will benefit if they can develop a collaborative relationship 
AND
each other~’s energy insecurities and find new ways to work toward cooperative outcomes.

Chinese naval modernization causes miscalculation, risking conflict with the US. 
**United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission 09** (&amp;#34;THE IMPLICATIONS OF CHINA~’S NAVAL MODERNIZATION FOR THE UNITED STATES,&amp;#34; HEARING BEFORE THE U.S.-CHINA ECONOMIC AND SECURITY REVIEW COMMISSION ONE HUNDRED ELEVENTH CONGRESS FIRST SESSION, June 11, http://www.uscc.gov/hearings/2009hearings/transcripts/09_06_11_trans/09_06_11_trans.pdf) 

In this hearing, witnesses told the Commission that the Chinese People~’s Liberation Army (

As a consequence, a naval arms race in East Asia may ensue.  


The risk of conflict in the South China Sea is particularly high- focusing on improving relations is critical.
**Glaser, CSIS Senior Fellow, 12** (Bonnie, Senior Fellow,Center for Strategic and International Studies,  Armed Clash in the South China Sea, http://www.cfr.org/east-asia/armed-clash-south-china-sea/p27883)

The risk of conflict in the South China Sea is significant. China, Taiwan
AND
one of the various disputes in the South China Sea from escalating militarily.


===Plan===

====Thus the plan:====

====The United States Federal Government should exclude crude oil and natural gas production from Exon-Florio reviews. ====


====Contention 5-Solvency:====

Narrowing the definition of national security to exclude &amp;#34;energy assets&amp;#34; insulates the CFIUS process from protectionist manipulation. 
**Carroll-Emory International Law Review-9** 23 Emory Int~’l L. Rev. 167 COMMENT: BACK TO THE FUTURE: REDEFINING THE FOREIGN INVESTMENT AND NATIONAL SECURITY ACT~’S CONCEPTION OF NATIONAL SECURITY
Conclusion Exon-Florio should be amended to more narrowly define national security. The 
AND
by embracing globalization and cooperation can the United States truly achieve national security.

And, oil and gas are the key energy issues for CFIUS.
**Ellis-Vinson %26 Elkins LLP-6/1/07**

Energy has traditionally been an area of some concern for CFIUS. In fact, 
AND
energy-related - a trend that has continued thus far in 2007.


And, the US should clarify that energy production does not undermine national security— explicitly exempting specific industries from CFIUS review is key.

What does this all mean for Exon-Florio? Almost since its enactment, 
AND
from global energy markets might result in a greater risk of supply disruption).

And, strikes don’t solve prolif and make escalation inevitable- Iran would face use-it-or-lose-it pressure, no hotlines exist, and Iran~’s command-and-control weakness risks unauthorized escalation.====

A new Rasmussen poll and early absentee ballot requests both suggest that President Barack Obama is losing his lead in Ohio after Mitt Romney~’s performance in Wednesday night~’s presidential debate.
A post-debate poll revealed Obama and Romney are essentially tied  in Ohio, with just one point separating the candidates. Earlier polls had shown Obama leading by up to eight points.
According to county data retrieved by conservative nonprofit American Majority Action (AMA) and reviewed by The Daily Caller, early absentee ballot requests also indicate Obama faces a tough battle in the state.
Compared to 2008, a higher percentage of Republicans have requested absentee ballots in the five largest counties in Ohio this year. Summit County saw a particularly large increase, with 27 points.
&amp;#34;Polls can be manipulated — real votes can~’t,&amp;#34; AMA President Ned Ryun said in a statement.
So far, Ohioans have requested just over half the amount of ballots they did in 2008.
&amp;#34;So far, although it is early, the overall across-the-board direction of every single county in Ohio seems to be not just challenging the pollsters~’ template that Obama is widening his lead, but is obliterating it,&amp;#34; University of Dayton professor Dr. Larry Schweikart told AMA.

**Wright v. Magellan Behavioral Health, Inc., 2007** U.S. Dist. LEXIS 48718  2007

In the instant case, the Court is required to interpret the word &amp;#34;restriction&amp;#34; as used by the parties in the Agreement. The parties apparently agree that the legal definition of restriction—&amp;#34;a limitation or qualification,&amp;#34; Black~’s Law Dictionary 1341 (8th ed. 1999)—is a good place to start. Thus, the Court must determine whether the board~’s supervision requirement falls within this definition.

====That means conditions on production not just prohibitions ====
**Google Dictionary**

qual•i•fi•ca•tion

noun /ˌkwäləfəˈkāSHən/ 
qualifications, plural

A quality or accomplishment that makes someone suitable for a particular job or activity
- only one qualification required—fabulous sense of humor

The action or fact of becoming qualified as a practitioner of a particular profession or activity
- an opportunity for student teachers to share experiences before qualification

A condition that must be fulfilled before a right can be acquired; an official requirement

====—-Their interpretation is bad ====

====A. Over limits-Their interpretation limits the topic to drill baby drill which is bad ground. SQ production is sky high which means better debates on the topic should be about things other than ANWR or the offshore drilling moratorium. ====

In international relations, illusions are not merely harmless fantasies. When political actors act

that do not bode well for US-China relations or regional stability.

China recently became the world&amp;#39;s second-largest economy and has emerged as the world&amp;#39;s

Narrowing the definition of national security to exclude “energy assets” insulates the CFIUS process from protectionist manipulation.

Conclusion Exon-Florio should be amended to more narrowly define national security. The 
AND
by embracing globalization and cooperation can the United States truly achieve national security.
And, oil and gas are the key energy issues for CFIUS.

Energy has traditionally been an area of some concern for CFIUS. In fact,

were energy-related - a trend that has continued thus far in 2007
And, the US should clarify that energy production does not undermine national security~-~- explicitly exempting specific industries from CFIUS review is key.

What does this all mean for Exon-Florio? Almost since its enactment,

from global energy markets might result in a greater risk of supply disruption).

Clarification of CFIUS priorities should focus on specific industries to green-light.

CFIUS should develop and make public both a list of strategic industries and a set

multilateral channels of engagement to make improvements and upgrades to the investment climate.
