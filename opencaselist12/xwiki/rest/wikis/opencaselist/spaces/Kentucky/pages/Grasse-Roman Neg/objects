Contention One ~-~-- Competition 
~-~--We’re a PIC out of their critique of the resolution ~-~-- We can agree with their critiques of switch-side and traditional debate in the abstract, however their rejection of the entire resolution means we only need to defend a single example to win the round.  
~-~--No permutations ~-~-- The rejection of the resolution is the only stable point of clash in the 1ac. Severance is a reason to reject the team. It eliminates any educational benefit to the 1ac by precluding any prepared contestation of affirmative claims, undermining affirmative advocacy skills and critical thinking.  
Contention Two ~-~-- Solvency 
~-~--The topic is a superior starting point to re-energize the debate space. Only from advocacies of specific programs like Green Jobs, Not Jails; a policy incentivizing the creation of solar power and green energy jobs for former victims of the prison-industrial complex can create an effective rallying point to unite racial justice, environmentalist and labor groups.

note EandP = exploration and production
C. Negative Interpretation Superior

1-Limits-The negative interpretation creates a fair limit by allowing affirmatives that increase access to energy production like opening up federal lands, offshore drilling and wind, nuclear power siting, and housing restrictions on solar panels. Their interpretation explodes the topic by allowing plans that merely reduce the cost or time involved in production. Limits are important for preserving manageable research burdens and in depth debates over the core of the topic. 

2-Ground-Access restrictions lock in core negative ground over the issue of opening up areas to energy production. Their interpretation encourages smaller affirmatives that dodge the central question of increased energy production by focusing on procedural regulatory changes.

Despite Senator Campbell’s reaction to Senator Bingaman’s proposed amendment, a review of the legislative history related to this provision suggests that the majority of the commentators were concerned that the waiver of the federal government’s liability contained in the then-pending TERA provisions amounted to an abrogation of the federal government’s trust responsibility to federally recognized tribes. This concern, like the issues previously examined, has likely contributed to tribes’ unwillingness to enter into a TERA.

Power is electrical generation- energy is the actual light and heat from the sun.

The definition of solar energy is that it is the radiant light and heat from the sun that has been harnessed by humans to create energy. The definition of solar power is electrical generation by means of heat engines or photovoltaics. Uses for solar power include but are not limited to:  space heating and cooling, water distillation, daylighting, hot water, thermal energy for cooking, and more.

Also, they reduce restrictions that make it easier for the government to procure energy, that is not topical and explodes limits

Snell Hall, Potsdam, NY, also from the Center for International Climate and Environmental Research, Oslo (CICERO), Norway (Fredric, “Green electricity policies in the United States: case study,” Energy Policy, December, Science Direct) Italics in original
There is considerable variation among states in both their regulatory environments and the policies that have been implemented to promote green electricity.... and other programs to increase market support for renewable energy technologies.

C. Vote Negative- Our interpretation protects core cases on the topic like Feed-in-Tariffs and tax credits for solar power. Their interpretation explodes the topic by conflating power and energy. It literally allows ANYTHING UNDER THE SUN like sun worship, sun bathing, passive heating like sky lights. They cannot access the race to the middle by referencing the sun because that places no meaningful limit on the topic.

But there’s a lot more holding back renewable power in the U.S. 
AND
solar market are really staggering,” says Ed Fenster, CEO of SunRun.

Not Cost effective 
The Regina Leader-Post 7 (“Alex Dzierba spoke Thursday about renewable energy resources for Saskatchewan” http://www.phys.uregina.ca/sites/phys/files/ADzierba_SolarPowerNotFeasible.pdf)
With the climate evidently changing, many are looking to the sky to lessen their 
AND
it would take 50 to 60 years to make up the capital costs.


And solar power will either take a long time or cost so much that it’s unfeasible, there’s several reasons – 

A. Steam turbines 
Fehrenbacher 8 (Katie Fehrenbacher is an editor at Earth2Tech, a Web publication that covers startups and entrepreneurs creating innovations to fight climate change, “8 off beat hurdles to solar power plants” http://gigaom.com/cleantech/8-offbeat-hurdles-for-solar-power-plants/)
Steam turbines: As the solar industry rapidly ramps up, individual components are slowing 
AND
GE is one of the few), the hardware is in tight supply.

B. Transmission lines 
Fehrenbacher 8 (Katie Fehrenbacher is an editor at Earth2Tech, a Web publication that covers startups and entrepreneurs creating innovations to fight climate change, “8 off beat hurdles to solar power plants” http://gigaom.com/cleantech/8-offbeat-hurdles-for-solar-power-plants/)
Transmission lines: While the first solar power plants are being built close to transmission lines, the vast majority of the sunny deserts are miles from any existing infrastructure. But permitting and capital costs for running high-tension wires for hundreds of miles are both large hurdles. SDGandE’s Sunrise Transmission project has seen it’s fair share of obstacles and more lines will still be needed.

C. Water lands 
Fehrenbacher 8 (Katie Fehrenbacher is an editor at Earth2Tech, a Web publication that covers startups and entrepreneurs creating innovations to fight climate change, “8 off beat hurdles to solar power plants” http://gigaom.com/cleantech/8-offbeat-hurdles-for-solar-power-plants/)
Water needs: Solar power plants require a lot of water, and water-cooled plants could be particularly hard to get permitted. Figuring out how to build the plants with less water — some use molten salt as a heat transfer fluid — could be a cheaper and easier option.

D. Spiritual Lands 
Fehrenbacher 8 (Katie Fehrenbacher is an editor at Earth2Tech, a Web publication that covers startups and entrepreneurs creating innovations to fight climate change, “8 off beat hurdles to solar power plants” http://gigaom.com/cleantech/8-offbeat-hurdles-for-solar-power-plants/)
Spiritual lands: Even more than the territorial hobbyists, the burial grounds or sacred lands of desert-living Native Americans are strong deterrents to putting up solar thermal collectors. Siting plants near or on such spaces has to be negotiated in the same way, though: with a lot of discussion and respect.
E. Dust and Terrorists 
Fehrenbacher 8 (Katie Fehrenbacher is an editor at Earth2Tech, a Web publication that covers startups and entrepreneurs creating innovations to fight climate change, “8 off beat hurdles to solar power plants” http://gigaom.com/cleantech/8-offbeat-hurdles-for-solar-power-plants/)

Observation One: Theory. The Counterplan is legitimate. It is grounded in the topic literature making it predictable and educational. Net benefits prove it is a germane policy making consideration. 

Observation Two: Net Benefits
First, the counterplan solves the case and avoids politics-Leveraging the removal of restrictions effectively builds bipartisan support for investing in clean energy research and development.

Overall US hegemony is resilient~-~--giving china the advantage on nuclear power will not tank US power projection capabilities, it will only give them more credibility in energy in East Asia, any challenger that would have been emboldened by that move was going to challenge the US inevitably, anyone deterrable by better US nuclear exports was going to be deterred by the HUGE conventional military the US has.

Interpretation
~-~--Financial incentives are distinguished from rules and regulations. There are 11 types of financial incentives. Their interpretation explodes the topic to include 30 types of incentives and policies. 
Database of State Incentives for Renewables and Efficiency 12
http://www.dsireusa.org/glossary/

DSIRE organizes incentives and policies that promote renewable energy and energy efficiency into two general categories ~-~- (1) Financial Incentives and (2) Rules, Regulations and Policies ~-~- and roughly 30 specific types of incentives and policies. This glossary provides a description of each specific incentive and policy type.

FINANCIAL INCENTIVES (click to collapse section)

    Corporate Tax Incentives
Corporate tax incentives include tax credits, deductions and exemptions. These incentives are available 
AND
equipment, are categorized as “Industry Recruitment/Support” in DSIRE.)
    Grant Programs
States offer a variety of grant programs to encourage the use and development of renewables 
AND
and energy efficiency projects for end-users. Grants are usually competitive.
    Green Building Incentives
Green buildings are designed and constructed using practices and materials that minimize the impacts of 
AND
under other DSIRE incentive categories, such as tax incentives and grant programs.)
    Industry Recruitment/Support
To promote economic development and the creation of jobs, some states offer financial incentives 
AND
include a sunset provision to encourage the industries to become self-sufficient.
    Loan Programs
Loan programs provide financing for the purchase of renewable energy or energy efficiency systems or 
AND
offered loans and/or loan guarantees for renewables and energy efficiency projects.
    PACE Financing
Property-Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) financing effectively allows property owners to borrow money to pay for renewable energy and/or energy-efficiency improvements. The amount borrowed is typically repaid over a period of years via a special assessment on the owner&amp;#39;s property. In general, local governments (such as cities and counties) that choose to offer PACE financing must be authorized to do so by state law.
    Performance-Based Incentives
Performance-based incentives (PBIs), also known as production incentives, provide cash 
AND
eligible commercial facility are categorized as “Corporate Tax Incentives” in DSIRE.)
    Personal Tax Incentives
Personal tax incentives include income tax credits and deductions. Many states offer these incentives 
AND
the federal government has offered personal tax credits for renewables and energy efficiency.
    Property Tax Incentives
Property tax incentives include exemptions, exclusions, abatements and credits. Most property tax 
AND
local taxing authorities the option of allowing a property tax incentive for renewables.
    Rebate Programs
States, utilities and a few local governments offer rebates to promote the installation of renewables and energy efficiency projects. The majority of rebate programs that support renewables are administered by states, municipal utilities and electric cooperatives; these programs commonly provide funding for solar water heating and/or photovoltaic (PV) systems. Most rebate programs that support energy efficiency are administered by utilities. Rebate amounts vary widely by technology and program administrator.
    Sales Tax Incentives
Sales tax incentives typically provide an exemption from, or refund of, the state sales tax (or sales and use tax) for the purchase of a renewable energy system, an energy-efficient appliance, or other energy efficiency measures. Several states have established an annual “sales tax holiday” for energy efficiency measures by annually allowing a temporary exemption – usually for one or two days – from the state sales tax.

RULES, REGULATIONS and POLICIES (click to collapse section)

    Appliance/Equipment Efficiency Standards
Many states have established minimum efficiency standards for certain appliances and equipment. In these 
AND
standard overrides the state standard (even if the state standard is stricter).
    Building Energy Codes
Building energy codes adopted by states (and some local governments) require commercial and
AND
local building energy codes require certain commercial facilities to meet green building standards.
    Energy Efficiency Resource Standards (EERS)
Energy efficiency resource standards (EERS) are state policies that require utilities to meet 
AND
cases, energy efficiency is typically included as a lower-tier resource.
    Energy Standards for Public Buildings
Many states and local governments, as well as the federal government, have chosen 
AND
site renewables generally establish conditional requirements tied to life-cycle cost analysis.
    Equipment Certification Requirements
Policies requiring renewable energy equipment to meet certain standards serve to protect consumers from buying inferior equipment. These requirements not only benefit consumers; they also protect the renewable energy industry by keeping substandard systems out of the market.
    Generation Disclosure
Some states require electric utilities to provide their customers with specific information about the electricity 
AND
that have not fully restructured their electricity markets require generation disclosure by utilities.
    Green Power Purchasing Policies
Government entities, businesses, residents, schools, non-profits and others can 
AND
project developers, through utility green power programs, or through community aggregation.
    Interconnection Standards
Interconnection standards specify the technical and procedural process by which a customer connects an electricity
AND
are weaker than standards and generally apply only to net-metered systems.)
    Line Extension Analysis
When a prospective customer requests electric service for a home or facility that is not 
AND
to provide information regarding renewable energy options when a line extension is requested.
    Mandatory Utility Green Power Option
Several states require electric utilities to offer customers the option to buy electricity generated from renewable resources, commonly known as “green power.” Typically, utilities offer green power generated using renewable resources that the utilities own (or for which they contract), or they buy renewable energy credits (RECs) from a provider certified by a state public utilities commission.
    Net Metering
For electric customers who generate their own electricity, net metering allows for the flow 
AND
in most U.S. states, but these policies vary widely.
    Public Benefit Funds
Most public benefit funds (PBFs) were developed by states during the electric utility restructuring era, in the late 1990s, to ensure continued support for renewable energy, energy efficiency and low-income energy programs. These funds are commonly supported through a very small surcharge on electricity consumption (e.g., $0.002/kWh). This charge is sometimes referred to as a &amp;#34;system benefits charge&amp;#34; (SBC). PBFs commonly support rebate programs, loan programs, research and development, and energy education programs.
    Renewables Portfolio Standards (RPS)
Renewable portfolio standards (RPSs) require utilities to use renewable energy or renewable energy 
AND
or a certain amount of generating capacity) according to a set schedule.
    Solar and Wind Access Policies
Solar and wind access policies are designed to establish a right to install and operate 
AND
orientation, zoning ordinances that contain building height restrictions, and solar permits.
    Solar and Wind Contractor Licensing
Some states have established a licensing process for solar-energy contractors and/or wind-energy contractors. These requirements are designed to ensure that contractors have the necessary knowledge and experience to install systems properly. Solar licenses typically take the form of either a separate, specialized solar contractor’s license, or a specialty classification under a general electrical or plumbing license.
    Solar and Wind Permitting Standards
Permitting standards can facilitate the installation of wind and solar energy systems by specifying the 
AND
supported the development of) model wind ordinances for use by local governments.

Gouchoe, 2k - North Carolina Solar Center Industrial Extension Service North Carolina State University (Susan, “Local Government and Community Programs and Incentives for Renewable Energy— National Report,” http://seg.fsu.edu/Library/casestudy%20of%20incentives.pdf

The Database of State Incentives for Renewable Energy (DSIRE) serves as the nation’s 
AND
from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Power Technologies.
The first three phases of the DSIRE project—surveys of state financial incentives, 
AND
Renewable Energy—has been produced concurrently with this report on local initiatives.
While reports serve as a snapshot of the status of incentives and programs, constant revisions and additions to the database maintain DSIRE’s role as the most up-to-date, national clearinghouse of information on incentives and programs for renewable energy. Through DSIRE on Line, the DSIRE database is accessible via the web at: http://www.ncsc.ncsu.edu/dsire.htm. In 2001, federal incentives will be added to the database, thereby providing a complete and comprehensive database of renewable energy incentives at all levels—national, state, and local.

Letter from Pakistan: How an unfair non-proliferation regime undermines nuclear security

In a September 1967 speech, V.C. Trivedi, the Indian Ambassador 
AND
the nonproliferation regime will become, and the safer the world will be.

This means they have no offense, the entire regime will die with US leadership 
ISN Security Watch 10 (“Nuclear Apartheid: Trouble Brewing amongst Non-Nuclear States,” http://oilprice.com/Geopolitics/International/Nuclear-Apartheid-Trouble-Brewing-Amongst-Non-Nuclear-States.html) 
While there are those that argue Article VI contains no promise to disarm (a viewpoint prevalent within the Bush administration) there is a general acceptance among the NWS - at least rhetorically - of the need for disarmament. US President Barack Obama in particular understands this; the recent deal with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev could not have been better timed to neutralize the inevitable clash in New York.
But there is larger problem. The ‘have nots,’ many of whom are modernizing states, feel they are being denied nuclear technology by the West under the guise of preventing proliferation - in contravention of the Treaty’s third pillar. They believe they are the victims of ‘technological apartheid’ - the new colonialism enshrined by the NPT itself.
That the five NPT Weapons States are also the UN P5 further adds to this notion of the strong oppressing the weak. This is why Iran justifies intransigence as standing up to ‘imperialism.’
Unless the NNWS’ concerns are addressed, a treaty that many consider moribund may die. This sobering thought must be uppermost in Obama’s mind.

A week later, one senator, Republican Lisa Murkowski of Alaska,

At that point, this second fiddle might not even be in the band.

Fairley 10 Peter, IEEE Spectrum, May, &amp;#34;Downsizing Nuclear Power Plants,” spectrum.ieee.org/energy/nuclear/downsizing-nuclear-power-plants/0

Reject the affirmatives call to action to solve proliferation. instead of expecting the truth about what is to be done, policy makers would benefit much through recognition of the limits of what can be known. The search for precise knowledge is impossible and causes policy calamities like Iraq~-~--it’s impossible to know true intentions of development and all of their expert knowledge is ideological and political, by definition, it can’t be objective

~-~--Imagining solutions to scenarios of global energy crisis serves as a numbing device preserving a childish naiveté that encourages us to fiddle while the planet burns ~-~-- The inherent tension between their imminent scenarios for extinction and the at least decade long timeframe before education can induce material change reveals the affirmative’s commitment to the status quo.

Suddenly, everything&amp;#39;s grim… playing the game.
