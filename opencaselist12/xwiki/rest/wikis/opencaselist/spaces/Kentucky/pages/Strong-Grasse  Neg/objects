~-~~-~-No permutations ~-~~-~- The rejection of the resolution is the only stable point of clash in the 1ac. Severance is a reason to reject the team.

~-~~-~-The topic is a superior starting point to re-energize the debate space.

There’s a lot of heated debate ... it’s time to embrace BIMBY 


~-~--Skwo Solves the Aff ~-~-- Environmental justice movements have already succeeded in reframing representations and focus of energy policy ~-~-- Empiric difficulty in translating that frame into policy action means the affirmative focuses on the wrong set of skills for effective activism.

**2nc Case Ans**
Turns the Case ~-~-- The affirmative’s de-legitimization of federal policymaking eliminates the only restriction on state and local governments who are much worse. 
Bullard - Their Author - 2011
Yerman Interviewing Dr. Robert D., Justice for Our Children, Mom’s For Clean Air, http://www.momscleanairforce.org/2011/11/16/dr-robert-d-bullard-justice-for-our-children/ 
When people demonize the EPA, it’s totally bogus ... circumstances, “states have done a lousy job.”


~-~--These arguments disprove the inevitability of zones of sacrifice in American energy policy and solvency for the counter-advocacy. Programs like Green Jobs, Not Jails that strategically engages with government policy and hold it accountable to its failed promise of democratic equality force the state to account for the externalities of production and halt the construction of zones of sacrifice.

~-~--Finally, this is a net benefit to the counter-advocacy ~-~-- Green Jobs, Not Jails precludes international outsourcing of energy policy externalities.

~-~--Prioritizing form over content turns the Aff ~-~-- Disconnecting the form of the 1ac from the material effects of their advocacy isolated in our case turns reifies structural racism ~-~-- Two reasons. 
(1.) Distances the affirmative from the real life effects of racism ~-~-- Privileging the principle of ‘identity’ at the expense of policy analysis fails by framing the debate along ideological terms replicating the same flawed logic as colorblind conservatism.   
Bracey 2006
Christopher A., Associate Professor of Law, Associate Professor of African and African American Studies, Washington University in St. Louis, September, Southern California Law Review, 79 S. Cal. L. Rev. 1231, p. 13-18
Second, reducing conversation on race ... deepens the cycle of resentment.


(2.) Makes challenging structural racism impossible ~-~-- Separating form for material consequences fails to account for the persistent ability of racism to hide among legal minutia. Additionally, this proves the counter-advocacy can overcome their offense about the inevitability of racial inequality with thorough policy analysis.

direct capital investment, but instead prioritizes reduction in pay-back period.
• Production incentives provide payment for electricity produced from the distributed electricity. These are

incentives have the potential to be invested in projects that do not materialize).
• Feed-in-Tariffs. This incentive type reduces investment risk by providing fixed payments for projects based on the levelized cost of renewable energy generation. This (among other design characteristics) distinguishes feed-in-tariffs from production-based incentives, which are based on monetizing the value of the electricity to the grid or the value to the electricity purchaser.
• Removing Siting Restrictions or Ensuring Broad Market Access. Siting restrictions can be stipulated

====2-Ground-Our interpretation locks in core links to core arguments like energy disadvantages and focuses the debate on the site of production. Their interpretation allows affirmatives the dodge the central question of the topic by only indirectly relating to the production of energy. ====

====—-The quest for cost-efficient fusion power presupposes a frame of technological determinism that reduces nuclear power to a purely technical question devoid of specific political context.

such reflection is accompanied by formal barriers against racism, it is meaningless.




===*2nc Overview* ===

====—-The roll of the ballot is to assess the desirability of change to government energy production policy. A topical affirmative must defend an example of the resolution and can only win if they prove government change is superior to the status quo or alternative policy option. ====

====—-If the affirmative fails to meet this burden you vote neg on presumption.====

====(A.) Dialogical division of ground is key to fair access to the debate space and a prerequisite to all educational benefits to debate.  ====
**Zwarensteyn 2012**
Ellen C., Masters Candidate in Communications at Grand Valley State University, High School Policy Debate as an Enduring Pathway to Political Education: Evaluating Possibilities for Political Learning, Masters Theses. Paper 35, http://scholarworks.gvsu.edu/theses/35
As referenced above, the resolution provides a basis for research and discussion. Using 
AND
better defense of one~’s own thought since ideas need defending against opposing argumentation.

====(B.) Fairness means you categorically disregard affirmative offense —- Absent equitable access to the debate space for all competitors; evaluations of affirmative truth claims are impossible. By shifting the point of argumentative clash away from the resolution the affirmative precludes pre-round research, argument development and in-depth debate. ====

====(C.) Framework comes first —- The impossibility of objective knowledge means the political informs the basis for representations, discourse, epistemology and ontology; not the other way around, that~’s SheeegaDOO====


===Topical Version of the Aff —- 2nc Framework===

====—-Multiple topical versions of the affirmative solve their offense and prove the potential for activist engagement with government policies that don~’t rely on the annihilation of blackness. ====

====—-Green Jobs, Not Jails. ====
**Reclaim the Future 2010**

Creating a just, restorative green economy that includes urban areas has the potential to

Nevertheless, there are signs that EJ activists and the political establishment might be able to cooperate on a social justice agenda that avoids distorting public health priorities in minority communities. The administration~’s &amp;#34;brownfields&amp;#34; urban revitalization initiative is the vehicle. By reducing disincentive barriers to local development unwittingly erected by Superfund~’s liability scheme, the Clinton EPA hopes to spur jobs, training, and life chances among communities of all colors throughout the country.

====—-Financial assistance to black energy companies as reparations. ====

====—-Locally controlled energy production alternatives.====

====—-Eliminate Neighborhood restrictions on solar and other energy production.====






===A2 Policing Turn —- 2nc Framework ===

====—-No link and turn —- Absent clash and the refusal of the burden of rejoinder only flips external exclusion—-the way to resolve policing is to broaden the scope of what counts as a persuasive argument within a given topic—-for example, our model of debate would welcome the use of narrative and personal experience on behalf of a topical argument—-this middle ground most effectively resolves their exclusion arguments. ====

This example not only shows why the issue of inclusion is so prominent in the 
AND
is to be done remains central&amp;#34; (ibid., p.168).

====—-No impact to their policing arguments —- Condemnation is inevitable, debate~’s ability to allow debaters to contest the conditions of their exclusion means it~’s distinct from engagements with the police. ====

One analyst, Gaurav Kampani, summarized the problem arrestingly: Three out of the world~’s four remaining states suspected of possessing chemical weapons are in Asia, and all of the states with biological weapons programs are Asian as well. Similarly, five of the current eight nuclear weapon powers are located on the continent, which is also home to the two other countries widely suspected of pursuing nuclear weapons programs—North Korea and Iran. The intersection of mass destruction capabilities and the rise of religious extremism, political disaffection, economic disarray, and deep interstate and intrastate conflicts make Asia the most disaster- prone region in the world.89

**Farrell 11 **(John Farrell directs the Energy Self-Reliant States and Communities program at the Institute for Local Self-Reliance and he focuses on energy policy developments that best expand the benefits of local ownership and dispersed generation of renewable energy. &amp;#34;The Economics of Distributed Generation&amp;#34;  http://www.ilsr.org/economics-distributed-generation/) 
The falling cost of distributed renewable generation has been one of the key drivers of

Countries abiding by the principles of comparative advantage not only result in cheaper goods,
