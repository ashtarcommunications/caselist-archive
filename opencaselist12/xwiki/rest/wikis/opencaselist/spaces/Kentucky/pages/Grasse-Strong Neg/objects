====—-The affirmative~’s view of energy as interchangeable units collapses the political by obfuscating structures of consumption. Energy policy becomes a rigged game requiring the annihilation of the environment, poverty and exploitation of billions.====&#xD;

In sum, encouraging a rational debate about &amp;#34;energy security&amp;#34; necessitates understanding what &#xD;

===Overview —- 2nc Energy Impact===&#xD;
&#xD;
====—-Depoliticizing energy production makes extinction inevitable —- Extend Illich —- Only political contestation can create the limits required to preserve the global biosphere and prevent the creation and use of world ending technology such as nuclear weapons.====&#xD;
&#xD;
====—-Specifically, failing to challenge the political structure of global energy production and consumption causes global war. ====&#xD;

 Remaining modern, however, also demands an increasing commitment to override what lags &#xD;
AND&#xD;

&#xD;
====—-This violence comparatively outweighs the aff in terms of both magnitude and probability —- Collapse of the political makes enmity invisible and genocidal.  ====&#xD;

&#xD;
====—-Makes solvency impossible —- Failure to politicize energy security naturalizes inequality sparking localistic, nationalist and religious backlash. Instead of promoting &amp;#34;energy security&amp;#34; we need to ask &amp;#34;energy security for who?&amp;#34;====&#xD;

One of the ironies of upper-case Energy Security is that it is unavoidably &#xD;

===Nuclear Power —- 2nc Energy Link===&#xD;

===A2 Permutation Do Both —- 2nc Energy Alt===&#xD;
&#xD;
====—-The permutation~’s pragmatic combination fails because it still allows the debate to be framed by &amp;#34;energy production&amp;#34; which taints the affirmative~’s ability to define problems and create solutions outside of existing structures of global inequality. ====&#xD;
