This will not be a replay of the 1930s, but a replay of the 1970s is a serious prospect. The world is in danger of undoing the market reforms of the 1980s and ~’90s that brought unprecedented prosperity, especially to emerging markets outside the West. Like the 1970s, policy backsliding could prolong a severe downturn and compromise eventual recovery. The short-term challenge is to arrest the slide to Big Government at home and creeping protectionism abroad. The medium-term challenge is to get back on track with trade and FDI liberalisation combined with domestic structural reforms – substantial &amp;#34;unﬁnished business&amp;#34; left before the crisis struck. More, not less, markets and globalisation are what the world needs. That is primarily a matter for unilateral action by governments and competitive emulation among them. It can be reinforced by international policy cooperation in the WTO, G20 and other fora, but not too much can be expected of cumbersome global-governance mechanisms. Overall, limits to government intervention and a well-functioning market economy are of a piece with open markets, economic globalisation and international political stability.&#xD;

**Hanger 12** (John, Special Counsel at the law firm Eckert Seamans, and former Secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection and Commissioner of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, &amp;#34;China Gets Cracking on Fracking: The Best Environmental News Of The Year?,&amp;#34;  Aug 14,  http://johnhanger.blogspot.com/2012/08/china-gets-cracking-on-fracking-good.html)&#xD;
&#xD;
China sits on natural gas reserves that are estimated to be 50% higher than the massive gas reserves in the USA. http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/energy/2012/08/120808-china-shale-gas/. Despite this gargantuan gas resource, coal provides China 80% of its electricity, compared to 34% in the USA, as of May 2012. Why the difference? The shale gas boom that is now more than 10 years long in the USA is just getting started in China and so the Chinese remain heavily reliant on coal to make electricity and for their total energy. Around the world, the basic energy choice is coal or gas. China is just the biggest example of this fundamental fact. China~’s reliance on coal means that its economic growth brings skyrocketing carbon emissions and other air pollution. Indeed, Chinese air quality is infamous around the world, and smog has been so thick that Beijing airport has been unable to land planes for short periods. As of 2011, China was responsible for 29% of the world~’s carbon emissions, while the US produced 16%, even though the US economy is still considerably bigger than China~’s. Moreover, US carbon emissions are declining to 1992 levels, but China~’s emissions skyrocket. Though China is building substantial new wind, solar, and nuclear generation, those investments are not enough to cut Chinese coal consumption, given economic growth that is still 7% in what some describe as an economic slowdown. Shale gas, however, could be big enough to actually displace significant amounts of coal in China. More gas in China means less mercury, soot. lead, smog, and carbon emissions. China~’s energy plans call for shale gas to provide 6% of its total energy as soon as 2020.  If it achieves that goal, China will avoid more than 500 million tons of carbon pollution per year or about 1.5% of today~’s total carbon emissions.&#xD;

====Increasing demand for Chinese coal production causes water shortages which threaten economic collapse and political instability. ====&#xD;

Restrictions on world oil production can be divided into four categories: 1. Geology

and restrictions on foreign investment has led to significant Mexican oil production decline.

Restrictions mean qualification on production
Wright v. Magellan Behavioral Health, Inc., 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 48718  2007

In the instant case, the Court is required to interpret the word &amp;#34;restriction&amp;#34; as used by the parties in the Agreement. The parties apparently agree that the legal definition of restriction—&amp;#34;a limitation or qualification,&amp;#34; Black’s Law Dictionary 1341 (8th ed. 1999)—is a good place to start. Thus, the Court must determine whether the board’s supervision requirement falls within this definition.

That means conditions on production not just prohibitions

The United States currently submits all foreign investment deals related to oil and gas production to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, known as CFIUS.  These restrictions chill foreign investment and send a signal of US protectionism.

Wilson Center 5-31-12 (Chinese Investment in North American Energy, http://www.wilsoncenter.org/event/chinese-investment-north-american-energy)

While Chinese foreign energy investment is on the rise, the more notable story is

AND

companies, which will allow China’s companies to better extract resources at home.
Scenario 1- Protectionism:
Global trade is on the brink of collapse- rising US protectionism risks global escalation.

Over the past few years, I and several other US trade-watchers have

And, restrictions on oil and gas investments explode the scope of foreign investment CFIUS reviews.  This expansion of the CFIUS process is a protectionist tool to keep out investment.

C. Economic Retaliation as a Result of CFIUS Protectionism Continued use of Exon-

And, protectionism sparks great power conflict and exacerbates all global problems.

President Obama has committed to working with U.S. trade partners to avoid

And, Unilateral FDI liberalization is key to prevent trade policy backsliding which dooms global economic recovery.

Erixon and Sally, directors-ECIPE, 10 (Fredrik and Razeen, European Centre for International Political Economy, TRADE, GLOBALISATION AND EMERGING PROTECTIONISM SINCE THE CRISIS, http://www.ecipe.org/media/publication_pdfs/trade-globalisation-and-emerging-protectionism-since-the-crisis.pdf)    italics are from original source We think Mr. Bentham’s world-view will cause damage, not only to domestic economies but also to the world trading system. This will not be a replay of the 1930s, but a replay of the 1970s is a serious prospect. The world is in danger of undoing the market reforms of the 1980s and ‘90s that brought unprecedented prosperity, especially to emerging markets outside the West. Like the 1970s, policy backsliding could prolong a severe downturn and compromise eventual recovery. The short-term challenge is to arrest the slide to Big Government at home and creeping protectionism abroad. The medium-term challenge is to get back on track with trade and FDI liberalisation combined with domestic structural reforms – substantial “unﬁnished business” left before the crisis struck. More, not less, markets and globalisation are what the world needs. That is primarily a matter for unilateral action by governments and competitive emulation among them. It can be reinforced by international policy cooperation in the WTO, G20 and other fora, but not too much can be expected of cumbersome global-governance mechanisms. Overall, limits to government intervention and a well-functioning market economy are of a piece with open markets, economic globalisation and international political stability.

 

 
Scenario 2- Economic Collapse:

 
Chinese FDI to the US declined sharply in 2012 but could rebound if the US takes steps to liberalize its national security FDI policy towards China.

Chinese shale development key to displace their coal use—renewables cant be scaled up fast enough.

Hanger 12 (John, Special Counsel at the law firm Eckert Seamans, and former Secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection and Commissioner of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, “China Gets Cracking on Fracking: The Best Environmental News Of The Year?,”  Aug 14,  http://johnhanger.blogspot.com/2012/08/china-gets-cracking-on-fracking-good.html)

 

China sits on natural gas reserves that are estimated to be 50% higher than the massive gas reserves in the USA. http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/energy/2012/08/120808-china-shale-gas/. Despite this gargantuan gas resource, coal provides China 80% of its electricity, compared to 34% in the USA, as of May 2012. Why the difference? The shale gas boom that is now more than 10 years long in the USA is just getting started in China and so the Chinese remain heavily reliant on coal to make electricity and for their total energy. Around the world, the basic energy choice is coal or gas. China is just the biggest example of this fundamental fact. China&amp;#39;s reliance on coal means that its economic growth brings skyrocketing carbon emissions and other air pollution. Indeed, Chinese air quality is infamous around the world, and smog has been so thick that Beijing airport has been unable to land planes for short periods. As of 2011, China was responsible for 29% of the world&amp;#39;s carbon emissions, while the US produced 16%, even though the US economy is still considerably bigger than China&amp;#39;s. Moreover, US carbon emissions are declining to 1992 levels, but China&amp;#39;s emissions skyrocket. Though China is building substantial new wind, solar, and nuclear generation, those investments are not enough to cut Chinese coal consumption, given economic growth that is still 7% in what some describe as an economic slowdown. Shale gas, however, could be big enough to actually displace significant amounts of coal in China. More gas in China means less mercury, soot. lead, smog, and carbon emissions. China&amp;#39;s energy plans call for shale gas to provide 6% of its total energy as soon as 2020.

While Chinese foreign energy investment is on the rise, the more notable story is

This will not be a replay of the 1930s, but a replay of the 1970s is a serious prospect. The world is in danger of undoing the market reforms of the 1980s and ~’90s that brought unprecedented prosperity, especially to emerging markets outside the West. Like the 1970s, policy backsliding could prolong a severe downturn and compromise eventual recovery. The short-term challenge is to arrest the slide to Big Government at home and creeping protectionism abroad. The medium-term challenge is to get back on track with trade and FDI liberalisation combined with domestic structural reforms – substantial &amp;#34;unﬁnished business&amp;#34; left before the crisis struck. More, not less, markets and globalisation are what the world needs. That is primarily a matter for unilateral action by governments and competitive emulation among them. It can be reinforced by international policy cooperation in the WTO, G20 and other fora, but not too much can be expected of cumbersome global-governance mechanisms. Overall, limits to government intervention and a well-functioning market economy are of a piece with open markets, economic globalisation and international political stability.

AGAINST THE GLOBAL TREND The recent growth of Chinese investment is even more remarkable in

the United States remains a top destination for FDI from China and elsewhere.

====Chinese shale development key to displace their coal use—renewables cant be scaled up fast enough. ====
**Hanger 12** (John, Special Counsel at the law firm Eckert Seamans, and former Secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection and Commissioner of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, &amp;#34;China Gets Cracking on Fracking: The Best Environmental News Of The Year?,&amp;#34;  Aug 14,  http://johnhanger.blogspot.com/2012/08/china-gets-cracking-on-fracking-good.html)

China sits on natural gas reserves that are estimated to be 50% higher than the massive gas reserves in the USA. http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/energy/2012/08/120808-china-shale-gas/. Despite this gargantuan gas resource, coal provides China 80% of its electricity, compared to 34% in the USA, as of May 2012. Why the difference? The shale gas boom that is now more than 10 years long in the USA is just getting started in China and so the Chinese remain heavily reliant on coal to make electricity and for their total energy. Around the world, the basic energy choice is coal or gas. China is just the biggest example of this fundamental fact. China~’s reliance on coal means that its economic growth brings skyrocketing carbon emissions and other air pollution. Indeed, Chinese air quality is infamous around the world, and smog has been so thick that Beijing airport has been unable to land planes for short periods. As of 2011, China was responsible for 29% of the world~’s carbon emissions, while the US produced 16%, even though the US economy is still considerably bigger than China~’s. Moreover, US carbon emissions are declining to 1992 levels, but China~’s emissions skyrocket. Though China is building substantial new wind, solar, and nuclear generation, those investments are not enough to cut Chinese coal consumption, given economic growth that is still 7% in what some describe as an economic slowdown. Shale gas, however, could be big enough to actually displace significant amounts of coal in China. More gas in China means less mercury, soot. lead, smog, and carbon emissions. China~’s energy plans call for shale gas to provide 6% of its total energy as soon as 2020.  If it achieves that goal, China will avoid more than 500 million tons of carbon pollution per year or about 1.5% of today~’s total carbon emissions.


====Increasing demand for Chinese coal production causes water shortages which threaten economic collapse and political instability. ====

This will not be a replay of the 1930s, but a replay of the 1970s is a serious prospect. The world is in danger of undoing the market reforms of the 1980s and ‘90s that brought unprecedented prosperity, especially to emerging markets outside the West. Like the 1970s, policy backsliding could prolong a severe downturn and compromise eventual recovery. The short-term challenge is to arrest the slide to Big Government at home and creeping protectionism abroad. The medium-term challenge is to get back on track with trade and FDI liberalisation combined with domestic structural reforms – substantial “unﬁnished business” left before the crisis struck. More, not less, markets and globalisation are what the world needs. That is primarily a matter for unilateral action by governments and competitive emulation among them. It can be reinforced by international policy cooperation in the WTO, G20 and other fora, but not too much can be expected of cumbersome global-governance mechanisms. Overall, limits to government intervention and a well-functioning market economy are of a piece with open markets, economic globalisation and international political stability.

China sits on natural gas reserves that are estimated to be 50% higher than the massive gas reserves in the USA. http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/energy/2012/08/120808-china-shale-gas/. Despite this gargantuan gas resource, coal provides China 80% of its electricity, compared to 34% in the USA, as of May 2012. Why the difference? The shale gas boom that is now more than 10 years long in the USA is just getting started in China and so the Chinese remain heavily reliant on coal to make electricity and for their total energy. Around the world, the basic energy choice is coal or gas. China is just the biggest example of this fundamental fact. China&amp;#39;s reliance on coal means that its economic growth brings skyrocketing carbon emissions and other air pollution. Indeed, Chinese air quality is infamous around the world, and smog has been so thick that Beijing airport has been unable to land planes for short periods. As of 2011, China was responsible for 29% of the world&amp;#39;s carbon emissions, while the US produced 16%, even though the US economy is still considerably bigger than China&amp;#39;s. Moreover, US carbon emissions are declining to 1992 levels, but China&amp;#39;s emissions skyrocket. Though China is building substantial new wind, solar, and nuclear generation, those investments are not enough to cut Chinese coal consumption, given economic growth that is still 7% in what some describe as an economic slowdown. Shale gas, however, could be big enough to actually displace significant amounts of coal in China. More gas in China means less mercury, soot. lead, smog, and carbon emissions. China&amp;#39;s energy plans call for shale gas to provide 6% of its total energy as soon as 2020.  If it achieves that goal, China will avoid more than 500 million tons of carbon pollution per year or about 1.5% of today&amp;#39;s total carbon emissions.

===Plan===

====The United States Federal Government should exclude crude oil and natural gas production from Exon-Florio reviews. ====

===Investment===

====Contention 1- investment ====

====The United States currently submits all foreign investment deals related to oil and gas production to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, known as CFIUS.  These restrictions chill foreign investment and send a signal of US protectionism. ====
**Wilson Center 5-31-12** (Chinese Investment in North American Energy, http://www.wilsoncenter.org/event/chinese-investment-north-american-energy)
While Chinese foreign energy investment is on the rise, the more notable story is 
AND
companies, which will allow China~’s companies to better extract resources at home.



====Scenario 1- Protectionism:====

====Global trade is on the brink of collapse- rising US protectionism risks global escalation. ====
**Lincicome 12** (Scott, trade attorney, &amp;#34;Is Missing American Trade Leadership Beginning to Bear Protectionist Fruit? (Hint: Kinda Looks Like It),&amp;#34; June 12,  http://lincicome.blogspot.com/2012/06/is-missing-american-trade-leadership.html)
Over the past few years, I and several other US trade-watchers have 
AND
its long-held place at the front of the trade liberalization pack.


====And, restrictions on oil and gas investments explode the scope of foreign investment CFIUS reviews.  This expansion of the CFIUS process is a protectionist tool to keep out investment.====

C. Economic Retaliation as a Result of CFIUS Protectionism Continued use of Exon-
AND
own interests to take any action that may destabilize the American economy. 182

====And, protectionism sparks great power conflict and exacerbates all global problems.====
**Patrick, Senior Fellow-CFR, 09** (Stewart, senior fellow and director of the Program on International Institutions and Global Governance at the Council on Foreign Relations, &amp;#34;Protecting Free Trade,&amp;#34; National Interest, March 13, 2009, http://nationalinterest.org/article/protecting-free-trade-3060?page=show)
President Obama has committed to working with U.S. trade partners to avoid

====And, Unilateral FDI liberalization is key to prevent trade policy backsliding which dooms global economic recovery.====
**Erixon and Sally, directors-ECIPE, 10** (Fredrik and Razeen, European Centre for International Political Economy, TRADE, GLOBALISATION AND EMERGING PROTECTIONISM SINCE THE CRISIS, http://www.ecipe.org/media/publication_pdfs/trade-globalisation-and-emerging-protectionism-since-the-crisis.pdf)    ~~italics are from original source~~ We think Mr. Bentham~’s world-view will cause damage, not only to domestic economies but also to the world trading system. This will not be a replay of the 1930s, but a replay of the 1970s is a serious prospect. The world is in danger of undoing the market reforms of the 1980s and ~’90s that brought unprecedented prosperity, especially to emerging markets outside the West. Like the 1970s, policy backsliding could prolong a severe downturn and compromise eventual recovery. The short-term challenge is to arrest the slide to Big Government at home and creeping protectionism abroad. The medium-term challenge is to get back on track with trade and FDI liberalisation combined with domestic structural reforms – substantial &amp;#34;unﬁnished business&amp;#34; left before the crisis struck. More, not less, markets and globalisation are what the world needs. That is primarily a matter for unilateral action by governments and competitive emulation among them. It can be reinforced by international policy cooperation in the WTO, G20 and other fora, but not too much can be expected of cumbersome global-governance mechanisms. Overall, limits to government intervention and a well-functioning market economy are of a piece with open markets, economic globalisation and international political stability.



====Scenario 2- Economic Collapse:====


====Chinese FDI to the US declined sharply in 2012 but could rebound if the US takes steps to liberalize its national security FDI policy towards China.====
**Hanemann 12-28** (Theo, research director at the Rhodium Group and leads the firm~’s cross-border investment work, Chinese FDI in the US in 2012, http://rhgroup.net/notes/chinese-direct-investmnet-in-the-u-s-in-2012-a-record-year-amid-a-gloomy-fdi-environment)
AGAINST THE GLOBAL TREND The recent growth of Chinese investment is even more remarkable in 
AND
the United States remains a top destination for FDI from China and elsewhere.

====And investment is low overall – more of it is critical to jobs and growth ====

China set a record with its investments around the world in 2012. And in 
AND

====And, energy restrictions destroy investor confidence, which crushes the dollar and triggers economic recession- the vague CFIUS interpretation of national security chills ALL foreign investment.====

While Chinese foreign energy investment is on the rise, the more notable story is

companies, which will allow China~’s companies to better extract resources at home.

This will not be a replay of the 1930s, but a replay of the 1970s is a serious prospect. The world is in danger of undoing the market reforms of the 1980s and ~’90s that brought unprecedented prosperity, especially to emerging markets outside the West. Like the 1970s, policy backsliding could prolong a severe downturn and compromise eventual recovery. The short-term challenge is to arrest the slide to Big Government at home and creeping protectionism abroad. The medium-term challenge is to get back on track with trade and FDI liberalisation combined with domestic structural reforms – substantial &amp;#34;unﬁnished business&amp;#34; left before the crisis struck. More, not less, markets and globalisation are what the world needs. That is primarily a matter for unilateral action by governments and competitive emulation among them. It can be reinforced by international policy cooperation in the WTO, G20 and other fora, but not too much can be expected of cumbersome global-governance mechanisms. Overall, limits to government intervention and a well-functioning market economy are of a piece with open markets, economic globalisation and international political stability.

Chinese shale development key to displace their coal use—renewables cant be scaled up fast enough. 
Hanger 12 (John, Special Counsel at the law firm Eckert Seamans, and former Secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection and Commissioner of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, “China Gets Cracking on Fracking: The Best Environmental News Of The Year?,”  Aug 14,  http://johnhanger.blogspot.com/2012/08/china-gets-cracking-on-fracking-good.html)

China sits on natural gas reserves that are estimated to be 50% higher than the massive gas reserves in the USA. http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/energy/2012/08/120808-china-shale-gas/. Despite this gargantuan gas resource, coal provides China 80% of its electricity, compared to 34% in the USA, as of May 2012. Why the difference? The shale gas boom that is now more than 10 years long in the USA is just getting started in China and so the Chinese remain heavily reliant on coal to make electricity and for their total energy. Around the world, the basic energy choice is coal or gas. China is just the biggest example of this fundamental fact. China&amp;#39;s reliance on coal means that its economic growth brings skyrocketing carbon emissions and other air pollution. Indeed, Chinese air quality is infamous around the world, and smog has been so thick that Beijing airport has been unable to land planes for short periods. As of 2011, China was responsible for 29% of the world&amp;#39;s carbon emissions, while the US produced 16%, even though the US economy is still considerably bigger than China&amp;#39;s. Moreover, US carbon emissions are declining to 1992 levels, but China&amp;#39;s emissions skyrocket. Though China is building substantial new wind, solar, and nuclear generation, those investments are not enough to cut Chinese coal consumption, given economic growth that is still 7% in what some describe as an economic slowdown. Shale gas, however, could be big enough to actually displace significant amounts of coal in China. More gas in China means less mercury, soot. lead, smog, and carbon emissions. China&amp;#39;s energy plans call for shale gas to provide 6% of its total energy as soon as 2020.  If it achieves that goal, China will avoid more than 500 million tons of carbon pollution per year or about 1.5% of today&amp;#39;s total carbon emissions.

Increasing demand for Chinese coal production causes water shortages which threaten economic collapse and political instability. 
Schneider 11 (Keith, senior editor for Circle of Blue-a nonprofit focusing on resource shortages founded in 2000, Choke Point: China—Confronting Water Scarcity and Energy Demand in the World’s Largest Country, Feb 15, http://www.circleofblue.org/waternews/2011/world/choke-point-china%E2%80%94confronting-water-scarcity-and-energy-demand-in-the-world%E2%80%99s-largest-country/)
By any measure, conventional and otherwise, China’s tireless advance to international economic prominence

===Contention One —- Chinese WMPs ===

====—-In the summer of 2005, Congress erupted in outrage at the possibility of Chinese investment in American oil and natural gas. Citing the apocalyptic threat of Sino &amp;#34;weapons of mass production,&amp;#34; Congress passed the Exon-Florio amendment empowering the Council on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) to severely restrict foreign energy investors. ====

Fear of foreign control has always politicized the Exon-Florio process. The tide 
AND
, Exon-Florio investigations are driven by the political winds in Congress.

====—-Specifically, the policy of energy security review places Chinese oil investment as part of a larger homogenous strategy for global domination. Corporate action that would otherwise be widely considered business as usual is securitized %26 presented as evidence of China~’s coordinated global assault on the American way of life. ====

While many foreign businesses are moving their operations to China, many Chinese businesses, 
AND
what is behind Chinese businesses is nothing short of the whole Chinese nation.

Mainstream policy responses to such issues are largely framed in terms of &amp;#34;energy security

Consequently, for all the claims of the ~’China threat~’ paradigm to be scientific knowledge 
AND
fulfilling prophecy, an issue which will be examined in the next chapter.

===Thus the plan —- The United States federal government should end Exon-Florio reviews for crude oil and natural gas production. ===

===Contention Two —- Global Production Networks ===

====—-Voting affirmative embraces a view of oil production as part of global production networks that transforms and deconstructs the nationalist economic lens. Such a move embodies a politics of international solidarity creating the space for pan-national connections between workers in China and the United States necessary to challenge and reshape both discourse %26 economic structure. ====

The data does indeed show that China has achieved unprecedented rates of growth and that 
AND
to build international solidarity and nationally complementary strategies to oppose and overcome it.

====—-The problem is one of framing. Reinterpreting energy investment actions as specific business interests working within transnational production networks rather than as aggression from a rising Chinese behemoth is transformative, exposing elite economic interests %26 challenging populist nationalism. ====

While such anti-China rhetoric and policies are lent credibility and urgency by the 
AND
lost much of their galvanising impact on the government or the general public.

**====—-The elimination of investment restrictions is a critical challenge to American economic unilateralism.

The complexities of the identity of Chinese businesses are reflected in both the extensive intermingling

Contention One ~-~-- Weapons of Mass Production
~-~--In the summer of 2005, Congress erupted in outrage at the possibility of Chinese investment in American oil and natural gas. Citing the apocalyptic threat of Sino “weapons of mass production,” Congress passed the Exon-Florio amendment empowering the Council on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) to severely restrict foreign energy investors.

The United States currently submits all foreign investment deals related to oil and gas production to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, known as CFIUS.  These restrictions chill foreign investment and send a signal of US protectionism.

This will not be a replay of the 1930s, but a replay of the 1970s is a serious prospect. The world is in danger of undoing the market reforms of the 1980s and ~’90s that brought unprecedented prosperity, especially to emerging markets outside the West. Like the 1970s, policy backsliding could prolong a severe downturn and compromise eventual recovery. The short-term challenge is to arrest the slide to Big Government at home and creeping protectionism abroad. The medium-term challenge is to get back on track with trade and FDI liberalisation combined with domestic structural reforms – substantial &amp;#34;unﬁnished business&amp;#34; left before the crisis struck. More, not less, markets and globalisation are what the world needs. That is primarily a matter for unilateral action by governments and competitive emulation among them. It can be reinforced by international policy cooperation in the WTO, G20 and other fora, but not too much can be expected of cumbersome global-governance mechanisms. Overall, limits to government intervention and a well-functioning market economy are of a piece with open markets, economic globalisation and international political stability.


And Scenario 2 is the economy – 
Chinese FDI to the US declined sharply in 2012 but could rebound if the US takes steps to liberalize its national security FDI policy towards China.

China sits on natural gas reserves that are estimated to be 50% higher than the massive gas reserves in the USA. http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/energy/2012/08/120808-china-shale-gas/. Despite this gargantuan gas resource, coal provides China 80% of its electricity, compared to 34% in the USA, as of May 2012. Why the difference? The shale gas boom that is now more than 10 years long in the USA is just getting started in China and so the Chinese remain heavily reliant on coal to make electricity and for their total energy. Around the world, the basic energy choice is coal or gas. China is just the biggest example of this fundamental fact. China~’s reliance on coal means that its economic growth brings skyrocketing carbon emissions and other air pollution. Indeed, Chinese air quality is infamous around the world, and smog has been so thick that Beijing airport has been unable to land planes for short periods. As of 2011, China was responsible for 29% of the world~’s carbon emissions, while the US produced 16%, even though the US economy is still considerably bigger than China~’s. Moreover, US carbon emissions are declining to 1992 levels, but China~’s emissions skyrocket. Though China is building substantial new wind, solar, and nuclear generation, those investments are not enough to cut Chinese coal consumption, given economic growth that is still 7% in what some describe as an economic slowdown. Shale gas, however, could be big enough to actually displace significant amounts of coal in China. More gas in China means less mercury, soot. lead, smog, and carbon emissions. China~’s energy plans call for shale gas to provide 6% of its total energy as soon as 2020.  If it achieves that goal, China will avoid more than 500 million tons of carbon pollution per year or about 1.5% of today~’s total carbon emissions.

THE UNCERTAIN JUDICIAL REVIEW OF CFIUS~’ DECISIONS In general, parties who are not satisfied 
AND
remains unclear what role the judicial review will play in future CFIUS decisions.  

CFIUS is a key test case for the scope of judicial review of the Treasury~’s Department~’s actions—an unlimited view of the Treasury~’s national security duties risks more reckless and aggressive actions
Zaring, Legal Prof @ Penn, 10 (David, Assistant Professor-Legal Studies Department @ the Wharton School of Business, University of Pennsylvania, &amp;#34;Administration by Treasury,&amp;#34; 95 Minn. L. Rev. 187 )
Treasury~’s new focus on national security is not restricted to FinCEN and OFAC. As 
AND
this area, the importance of this question will likely grow as well.

Specifically, an unchecked Treasury will test the bounds of their national security powers—causes them to over-enforce terrorist financing laws
Zaring 10 (David, Assistant Professor-Legal Studies Department @ the Wharton School of Business, &amp;#34;Administration by Treasury,&amp;#34; 95 Minn. L. Rev. 187 )
Finally, Treasury is increasingly playing a national security role, which three of its 
AND
to the cautious embrace of Treasury~’s approach to administrative procedure is taken here.


2 internal links:
First—international terrorist financing cooperation—the Treasury~’s current approach undermines international cooperation on terrorist financing by tarnishing our reputation with critical allies.

American Civil Liberties Union, Blocking Faith, Freezing Charity: Chilling Muslim Charitable Giving in the &amp;#34;War on Terrorism Financing&amp;#34;, June, http://www.aclu.org/files/pdfs/humanrights/blockingfaith.pdf)
Reports suggest that there are high diplomatic costs for federal government actions against U.
AND
gaining ground overseas partially because of the blockage of the Muslim charities.&amp;#34;551

And, Effective terror financing controls are key to prevent attacks.
Kiser 05 (Steve, Financing Terror An Analysis and Simulation for Affecting Al Qaeda~’s Financial Infrastructure, http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/rgs_dissertations/2005/RAND_RGSD185.pdf)
Money is Perceived as Important to Terrorist Organizations Many policymakers and analysts believe quite strongly 
AND
to raise and move money around the world, terrorists cannot function.&amp;#34;12

Second, Muslim American law enforcement cooperation- Treasury crackdown on Muslim charities is the primary reason that Muslim communities won~’t cooperate with the FBI- this cooperation is critical to counter-terrorism efforts.
Turner 09 (Jennifer, Human Rights Researcher for the ACLU~’s Human Rights Program, for the 
American Civil Liberties Union, Blocking Faith, Freezing Charity: Chilling Muslim Charitable Giving in the &amp;#34;War on Terrorism Financing&amp;#34;, June, http://www.aclu.org/files/pdfs/humanrights/blockingfaith.pdf)
The ACLU~’s research showed that the federal government~’s actions towards Muslim charities and donors have 
AND
. If they do, I guarantee you it will be productive.&amp;#34;538

And, this cooperation is key to beat terrorism- military power alone will fail.

Washington~’s early response to a terrorist nuclear attack on its own soil might also raise
