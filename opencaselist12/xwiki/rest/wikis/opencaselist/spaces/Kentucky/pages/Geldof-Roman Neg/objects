====B. Negative Interpretation is Superior ====

1-Limits-Our interpretation allows a fair number of mechanisms like grants, tax incentives, and loans. Their interpretation explodes the topic by including a number of rules and regulations like feed-in tariffs, net metering requirements, green power certification, and procurement.  Fair limits are important to encourage clash and manageable research burdens. 

2-Ground-Procurement is a distinct mechanism independent of affirmatives that are required directly to stimulate commercialization in the market. Procurement also allows the affirmative to dodge core generics like the energy DA by increasing procurement in contained areas like nuclear submarines.

Lyman was skeptical about the prospects for reductions in manufacturing cost resulting from the industrial learning process, and therefore argued that the US should expect smaller reactors to be more expensive per MW. Further, Lyman said that standard economics of scale point to SMRs having overnight capital costs a factor of 2 to 3 higher per MW than large reactors. </headline></objectSummary><objectSummary><link rel="http://www.xwiki.org/rel/object" href="http://opencaselist.paperlessdebate.com/xwiki/rest/wikis/opencaselist/spaces/Kentucky/pages/Geldof-Roman%20Neg/objects/Admin.EntryClass/8"/><link rel="http://www.xwiki.org/rel/properties" href="http://opencaselist.paperlessdebate.com/xwiki/rest/wikis/opencaselist/spaces/Kentucky/pages/Geldof-Roman%20Neg/objects/Admin.EntryClass/8/properties"/><id>opencaselist:Kentucky.Geldof-Roman Neg:f1422601-afb5-4f4e-87a2-c808a598a17d</id><guid>f1422601-afb5-4f4e-87a2-c808a598a17d</guid><pageId>opencaselist:Kentucky.Geldof-Roman Neg</pageId><wiki>opencaselist</wiki><space>Kentucky</space><pageName>Geldof-Roman Neg</pageName><className>Admin.EntryClass</className><number>8</number><headline>====1.

====C. Negative Interpretation is Superior ====

====1-Limits-Our interpretation allows a fair number of cases that increase incentives directly tied to energy production. Their interpretation explodes the topic by allowing a large number of mechanisms that indirectly promote production. ====

====2-Ground-Our interpretation locks in core links to core arguments like energy disadvantages and focuses the debate on the site of production. Their interpretation allows affirmatives the dodge the central question of the topic by only indirectly relating to the production of energy. ====

The United States has significantly increased its natural gas production since 2005, largely because of advancements in extraction technology. These technological improvements are relatively new, so their exact long-term impact on U.S. production is currently unclear. However, in the short term, this increased production has caused domestic prices to decrease substantially.

Proponents of nuclear power downplay or ignore altogether the problems that would be exacerbated by an expansion of nuclear power globally or the introduction of nuclear power into Australia — including nuclear weapons proliferation, radioactive waste, and the risk of catastrophic accidents. Nuclear weapons proliferation. The &amp;#34;peaceful&amp;#34; nuclear power and research sectors have produced enough fissile material to build over 110,000 nuclear weapons. Australian uranium has resulted in the production of more than 60 tonnes of plutonium, sufficient to produce about 6000 nuclear weapons. Supposedly &amp;#34;peaceful&amp;#34; nuclear facilities can be — and have been — used in various ways for weapons research and production. Of the 60 countries which have built nuclear power or research reactors, about 25 are known to have used their &amp;#34;peaceful&amp;#34; nuclear facilities for covert weapons research and/or production — a strike rate of about 40%. Israel, India, Pakistan, South Africa and possibly North Korea have succeeded in producing nuclear weapons under cover of a &amp;#34;peaceful&amp;#34; nuclear program (details at http://www.mapw.org.au/nuclear-reactors/02green.html). Claims that the international safeguards system prevents misuse of &amp;#34;peaceful&amp;#34; nuclear facilities and materials are grossly overstated. Recent statements from the UN~’s International Atomic Energy Agency and US President George Bush about the need to limit the spread of enrichment and reprocessing technology, and to establish multinational control over sensitive nuclear facilities, amount to an acknowledgement of the fundamental flaws of the international safeguards system.

C. Negative Interpretation Superior
1-Limits-The negative interpretation creates a fair limit by allowing affirmatives that increase access to energy production like opening up federal lands, offshore drilling and wind, nuclear power siting, and housing restrictions on solar panels. Their interpretation explodes the topic by allowing plans that merely reduce the cost or time involved in production. Limits are important for preserving manageable research burdens and in depth debates over the core of the topic. 
2-Ground-Access restrictions lock in core negative ground over the issue of opening up areas to energy production. Their interpretation encourages smaller affirmatives that dodge the central question of increased energy production by focusing on procedural regulatory changes.

Despite Senator Campbell’s reaction to Senator Bingaman’s proposed amendment, a review of the legislative history related to this provision suggests that the majority of the commentators were concerned that the waiver of the federal government’s liability contained in the then-pending TERA provisions amounted to an abrogation of the federal government’s trust responsibility to federally recognized tribes. This concern, like the issues previously examined, has likely contributed to tribes’ unwillingness to enter into a TERA.
Contention Two ~-~-- Corporate Exploitation 
~-~--Expanding TERA provisions without federal liability increases corporate exploitation.

As an alternative, a second recommendation for reforming the existing TERA provisions would call

This waiver could actually undermine the concept of tribal self determination by making it clear

Economic integration prevents their impacts from escalating 
**Griswold, 7 (**Daniel, director of the Center for Trade Policy Studies, 4/20/2007, Trade, Democracy and Peace, HYPERLINK &amp;#34;http://www.freetrade.org/node/681-http://www.freetrade.org/node/681&amp;#34; http://www.freetrade.org/node/681-http://www.freetrade.org/node/681)
A little-noticed headline on an Associated Press story a while back reported, &amp;#34;War declining worldwide, studies say.&amp;#34; In 2006, a survey by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute found that the number of armed conflicts around the world has been in decline for the past half-century. Since the early 1990s, ongoing conflicts have dropped from 33 to 17, with all of them now civil conflicts within countries. The Institute~’s latest report found that 2005 marked the second year in a row that no two nations were at war with one another. What a remarkable and wonderful fact. The death toll from war has also been falling. According to the Associated Press report, &amp;#34;The number killed in battle has fallen to its lowest point in the post-World War II period, dipping below 20,000 a year by one measure. Peacemaking missions, meanwhile, are growing in number.&amp;#34; Current estimates of people killed by war are down sharply from annual tolls ranging from 40,000 to 100,000 in the 1990s, and from a peak of 700,000 in 1951 during the Korean War. Many causes lie behind the good news—the end of the Cold War and the spread of democracy, among them—but expanding trade and globalization appear to be playing a major role in promoting world peace. Far from stoking a &amp;#34;World on Fire,&amp;#34; as one misguided American author argued in a forgettable book, growing commercial ties between nations have had a dampening effect on armed conflict and war. I would argue that free trade and globalization have promoted peace in three main ways. First, as I argued a moment ago, trade and globalization have reinforced the trend toward democracy, and democracies tend not to pick fights with each other. Thanks in part to globalization, almost two thirds of the world~’s countries today are democracies—a record high. Some studies have cast doubt on the idea that democracies are less likely to fight wars. While it~’s true that democracies rarely if ever war with each other, it is not such a rare occurrence for democracies to engage in wars with non-democracies. We can still hope that as more countries turn to democracy, there will be fewer provocations for war by non-democracies. A second and even more potent way that trade has promoted peace is by promoting more economic integration. As national economies become more intertwined with each other, those nations have more to lose should war break out. War in a globalized world not only means human casualties and bigger government, but also ruptured trade and investment ties that impose lasting damage on the economy. In short, globalization has dramatically raised the economic cost of war.

And, these wars cause extinction

Immigration first—-congress has moved on from fiscal fights

Presidential power also is a finite and generally decreasing product. The first hundred days

Winners win is empirically denied—-opportunities come they are not created

That story line, stoked by Republicans but shared by some Democrats, holds that 
AND
, when the opposition typically takes seats from the president~’s party in Congress.

**Can~’t win with energy **
**Harder 2/7** (Amy, is a National Journal Energy Policy Analyst, &amp;#34;In Washington Energy and Climate Issues Get Shoved in the Closet,&amp;#34; http://www.nationaljournal.com/columns/power-play/in-washington-energy-and-climate-issues-get-shoved-in-the-closet-20130206)
A week later, one senator, Republican Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, was standing at the podium in the same room to unveil her energy-policy blueprint. There were several open seats and just a few cameras. At least one reporter was there to ask the senator about her position on President Obama~’s choice for Defense secretary, former Republican Sen. Chuck Hagel.
&amp;#34;I~’m doing energy right now,&amp;#34; Murkowski responded. &amp;#34;I~’m focused on that.&amp;#34;
Almost everyone else on Capitol Hill is focused on something else. Aside from the broad fiscal issues, Congress and the president are galvanizing around immigration reform.
Four years ago, the White House prioritized health care reform above comprehensive climate-change legislation. The former will go down in history as one of Obama~’s most significant accomplishments. The latter is in the perpetual position of second fiddle. &amp;#34;To everything,&amp;#34; Murkowski interjected fervently when asked by National Journal Daily whether energy and climate policy was second to other policies in Washington~’s pecking order.
Murkowski, ranking member of the Senate~’s Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said she hoped the Super Bowl blackout would help the public understand the importance of energy policy.
&amp;#34;This issue of immigration: Why are we all focused on that? Well, it~’s because the Republicans lost the election because in part we did not have the Hispanic community behind us,&amp;#34; Murkowski said this week. &amp;#34;What is it that brings about that motivation? Maybe it could be something like a gap in the Super Bowl causes the focus on energy that we need to have. I can only hope.&amp;#34;
It will take more than hope. Elections have consequences, but so far the only kind of electoral consequence climate and energy policy has instigated is one that helped some lawmakers who supported cap-and-trade legislation to lose their seats in the 2010 midterm elections. For the pendulum to swing the other way—for lawmakers to lose their seats over not acting on climate and energy policy—seems almost unfathomable right now.
Billions of dollars are invested in the fossil-fuel power plants, refineries, and pipelines that the country depends on today. The companies that own this infrastructure have a business interest in keeping things the way they are. Immigration reform doesn~’t face such formidable interests invested in the status quo.
&amp;#34;They ~~businesses~~ have employees—real, visible people—who they value and who they want to make legal as soon as possible,&amp;#34; said Chris Miller, who until earlier this year was the top energy and environment adviser to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev.
On energy and climate-change policy, Miller added, &amp;#34;You~’re probably never going to have anything like the fence in the Southwest or the border-control issue that pushes action and debate on immigration, because climate-change impacts will likely continue to be more abstract in the public~’s mind until those impacts are so crystal-clear it~’s too late for us to do anything.&amp;#34;
Another, tactical reason helps build momentum on immigration and not on other issues. Obama can capitalize on immigration as it becomes more of a wedge issue within the GOP. On energy and climate policy, Obama faces a unified Republican Party.
&amp;#34;The president has cracked the code on how to push his agenda items through
AND
a big win on immigration reform while striking a political blow to Republicans.&amp;#34;
While Obama maneuvers for a big legislative win on immigration, he~’s moving on a parallel track toward another win on climate change through Environmental Protection Agency rules controlling greenhouse-gas emissions, which don~’t require congressional approval. Fresh off a strong reelection victory, Obama has more freedom to move unilaterally with EPA.
&amp;#34;He doesn~’t have to expend political capital or ask Democrats to extend their necks on this issue,&amp;#34; said Kevin Book, an energy analyst at the Washington-based consulting firm ClearView Energy Partners. &amp;#34;He already won. He can control the issue and move as fast or slow as he wants.&amp;#34;
The EPA action will only further polarize efforts, such as those by Murkowski on the Senate Energy panel, to move through Congress smaller bits of energy and environmental policy.
At that point, this second fiddle might not even be in the band.

**Fairley 10** Peter, IEEE Spectrum, May, &amp;#34;Downsizing Nuclear Power Plants,&amp;#34; spectrum.ieee.org/energy/nuclear/downsizing-nuclear-power-plants/0

The cumulative impact of these coal port proposals on coal consumption in Asia could be much larger than even that implied by the two pending proposals. If Arch, Peabody, and other western U.S. coal producers~’ projections of the competitiveness of western coal in Asia are correct, facilitating the opening of the development of West Coast coal ports could have a very large impact on the supply of coal to China and the rest of Asia.

Nuclear intelligence fails – actionable intelligence can~’t be translated into practice effectively
Sokolski, 11 ~~What Nuclear Power~’s Revival Will Now Require: Tightening the Rules Testimony of Henry Sokolski Executive Director The Nonproliferation Policy Education Center Washington, DC, March 17, 2011  Room 2172  Rayburn House Office Building  Washington, DC, http://foreignaffairs.house.gov/112/sok031711.pdf-http://foreignaffairs.house.gov/112/sok031711.pdf~~ 
Nuclear Inspections and Intelligence: What Are the Limits?  This is where the idea of strengthening existing nuclear inspections and enhancing national  intelligence are generally held up as nonproliferation solutions. In the case of IAEA inspections,  much can be done to improve near-real time surveillance of inspected sites with remote sensors  and secure communication links. Securing talented inspectors and retaining more of them would  also be both possible and useful.  15. See Committee on Review of DOE~’s Nuclear Energy Research and Development Program,  National Research Council, ―Minority Opinion: Dissenting State of Gilinsky and Macfarlane,‖  in Review of DOE~’s Nuclear Energy Research and Development Program (Washington, DC:  National Academies Press, 2008), available at  http://armscontrolcenter.org/assets/pdfs/macfarlane_gilinsky.pdf and Frank Von Hippel,  ―Managing Spent Fuel in the United States: The Illogic of Reprocessing,‖ in Henry Sokolski  editor, Falling Behind: International Scrutiny of the Peaceful Atom (Carlisle, PA: Strategic  Studies Institute, 2008), pp. 159-221.  16. On the matter of the NPT and the right to peaceful nuclear energy,  11  Yet, simply sending money to the IAEA and increasing its authority ought not to be seen as a  panacea. Most U.S. officials, for example, are extremely enthusiastic about increasing the  number of state adherents to the IAEA~’s latest inspection understanding, The Additional  Protocol, which authorizes the IAEA to conduct more intrusive inspections than under existing  safeguards agreements. The increased inspection authority that the Additional Protocol affords,  though, is most commonly occasioned by a reduction in the number of routine inspections. Once  a country qualifies for Additional Protocol inspections, it is argued, it should be trusted more and  inspected less. This lessens IAEA inspection loads but it also reduces IAEA safeguards presence  on the ground.  There also are real limits on IAEA inspections. After Iran, Iraq, Libya, Syria, and Algeria, we  learned that in the most dangerous cases, the IAEA cannot always meet its own timeliness  nuclear detection goals. Safeguarding nuclear fuel making (e.g., enrichment, reprocessing, fuel  fabrication, uranium hexafluoride production) and nuclear weapons usable fuels (highly enriched  uranium, separated plutonium, mixed oxide fuel) anywhere; and large civilian nuclear facilities  in hostile states (e.g., Iran and North Korea), are among these cases. In these instances, the  inspected nuclear activities and materials are so close to bomb making that there is scant time  even with discovery of a diversion to do much and a high likelihood that any discovery might  come after the diversion if at all.17  Finally, recent research suggests that for large organizations with conflicting goals regarding the  regulation of complex technologies, their mere expansion may not help and, in certain cases,  could actually make matters worse. These research findings could easily apply to the IAEA,  which is designed both to promote civilian nuclear applications and to restrain them to assure  they stay peaceful. These two opposing IAEA functions make achieving the agency~’s  safeguarding mission difficult. It also makes determining how much one is ―strengthening‖ the  IAEA inherently tricky.18  This, then, brings us to the utility of improving national intelligence capabilities. Since the late  l980s, much has been made of what the U.S. and other states might do to ―counter‖ proliferation  with trade interdictions, covert operations, passing off sensitive information to agencies like the  IAEA and, if necessary, military strikes. All of these operations may be needed; all demand  timely, actionable intelligence.  To argue that we can depend on such operations to prevent proliferation if we only could secure  more ―actionable‖ intelligence, though, would be a stretch. First, there are severe limits on how  much actionable intelligence any country is comfortable sharing with allies, much less  international organizations. Second, there are limits on how much information most  governments, including our own, are likely to demand about states that are about to or may have  already acquired nuclear weapons. In more than a few cases, getting or sharing such information  becomes awkward since it can force officials to have to act in ways they may be disinclined to.  This arguably was the case with Israel, Pakistan, and North Korea, where at various points,  senior U.S. officials actually kept intelligence officers from inspecting or reporting more on what  actually was occurring in each of these countries nuclear weapons programs. We subsequently  have had to downplay the implications of nonproliferation failures in each of these cases. This  suggests that our problem in preventing proliferation may not be the lack of actionable  intelligence so much as a lack of demand for it in the hardest and, arguably, most important  cases.19

Plants not key to nuclear primacy 
Elaine M. Grossman 12, Global Security Newswire, &amp;#34;U.S. Warhead Upkeep to Get Top Priority if Deeper Budget Cuts are Imposed&amp;#34;, March 8, http://www.nti.org/gsn/article/us-warhead-upkeep-get-top-priority-if-deeper-budget-cuts-are-imposed/-http://www.nti.org/gsn/article/us-warhead-upkeep-get-top-priority-if-deeper-budget-cuts-are-imposed/

The U.S. National Nuclear Security Administration would give highest priority to maintaining warheads fielded on the nation~’s arsenal of ICBMs, ballistic missile submarines and bomber aircraft if automatic budget cuts affect the agency next year, the top NNSA official said on Thursday (see GSN, Feb. 17).
&amp;#34;If there is a reduction in this area, the thing we are going to focus on first and foremost is doing the surveillance work … on our existing stockpile ~~and ensuring~~ that today~’s deterrent is taken care of,&amp;#34; said Thomas D~’Agostino, the agency administrator.  &amp;#34;Then we will work with the Defense Department to understand their priorities.&amp;#34;
The 2011 Budget Control Act mandates a roughly %24450 billion cut in defense spending over the next decade, and that amount could more than double if lawmakers do not by 2013 reverse the legislation~’s call for %241.2 trillion in additional government-wide reductions. 
Whether the more drastic budget &amp;#34;sequester&amp;#34; would affect NNSA programs is uncertain, D~’Agostino said. 
However, given how much work the agency performs on behalf of the Pentagon, NNSA officials are planning now for the possibility that their programs will be affected by any new round of significant federal budget cuts.  A portion of the agency~’s annual spending also comes directly from Defense Department coffers, according to the White House.
The nuclear security organization — a semiautonomous arm of the Energy Department — is working on three major projects to extend the service lives of U.S. nuclear warheads: The W-76, used on Navy Trident D-5 submarine-based ballistic missiles; the B-61, fielded on Air Force gravity bombs; and an effort to combine updates of the W-78, carried by Minuteman 3 ICBMs, and the W-88, a second weapon for Navy Trident missiles.
Under the service life extension programs, NNSA officials work with their Defense Department counterparts to refurbish or replace aging components of decades-old nuclear arms.  The effort is aimed at keeping the U.S. stockpile safe and effective without nuclear explosive testing, which Washington has by policy set aside in a moratorium dating to the early 1990s. 
Along with major overhauls for different weapon types, the nuclear agency also regularly checks deployed warheads to assure that they remain in working order.
A bipartisan panel of House and Senate lawmakers late last year failed to agree on 
AND
personnel and military operations (see GSN, Nov. 15, 2011).
If a budget sequester triggers &amp;#34;a dramatic change in ~~military~~ force structure, it could impact what systems we work on,&amp;#34; D~’Agostino told reporters at a Defense Writers Group question-and-answer session.
Under a scenario in which the nuclear agency budget is reduced, D~’Agostino said he would have to weigh possible delays in the three major warhead-overhaul efforts.
&amp;#34;We will work with the Defense Department to understand their priorities … to figure out which of these three priority projects can we defer ~~or~~ push back the date on, and ~~decide~~ what~’s more important,&amp;#34; he said.
At this time, &amp;#34;I don~’t want to tell you what gets cut because I don~’t know what&amp;#34; programs might be affected, D~’Agostino said.  &amp;#34;I don~’t want to make any speculation that we~’re going to take a %24500 million cut and therefore the last %24500 million is such-and-such.  I don~’t know that we would take any cut at all, frankly, in sequestration.&amp;#34;
The NNSA budget request for fiscal 2013 calls for %2411.5 billion in funding, of which %247.6 billion would be used to &amp;#34;maintain a safe, secure, and effective nuclear deterrent.&amp;#34;  The nuclear deterrent funds constitute a 5 percent hike from current spending levels but %24372 million less than the administration had projected in 2010. The next budget year begins on Oct. 1.
The NNSA administrator said lawmakers have not yet weighed in on their priorities for his agency should a budget sequester materialize.  However, he made clear that he could not accept any change in what he believes to be his most important national security responsibilities.
&amp;#34;We feel very strongly that the No. 1 priority is taking care of 
AND
maybe in depot facilities around the country&amp;#34; remains sound, he said.
&amp;#34;That~’s No. 1 because that~’s the material … that~’s out there with the Defense Department,&amp;#34; D~’Agostino added.  &amp;#34;So safety of that stockpile is paramount.  And the only way we~’re assured safety of it is to constantly surveil it and watch it.&amp;#34;

===U-U.S. Domestic Coal Up===

====Uniqueness is goldilocks—-U.S. coal demand will grow slowly now—-but declines cause a shift to production for export markets====
Anthony **Fensom 10-23**, experienced business writer and communication consultant with more than a decade~’s experience in the financial and media industries of Australia and Asia, 10/23/12, &amp;#34;Don~’t Write the Obituary Just Yet: ~’King Coal~’ Still Reigns,&amp;#34; The Diplomat, http://thediplomat.com/pacific-money/2012/10/23/despite-short-term-pain-king-coal-still-reigns/
Yet despite softer demand, strong production rates in Australia, Indonesia and the United States along with the emerging coal producer of Mongolia have lifted supply. Broker UBS expects top-grade thermal coal prices to drop from U.S.%24105-110 per ton in 2012 to US%2490 per ton in 2015/16, with coking coal prices also to decline. 
As the world~’s largest exporter of coking coal and second-largest exporter of thermal coal, Australia~’s industry has suffered disproportionately from the slowdown, with low prices and high costs sparking a wave of layoffs. 
Among recent retrenchments, Xstrata Coal has cut 600 jobs, Ensham 350 and BHP Billiton Mitsubishi Alliance (BMA) 300, with a number of coal projects either wound back or deferred. 
Queensland~’s coal industry has also been hit with increased royalties from a cash-strapped state government, prompting warnings by the Queensland Resources Council that more industry cost-cutting was likely. 
Coal reporter Lou Caruana, editor of International Longwall News, told The Diplomat that additional cutbacks might be in the pipeline should prices fall further. 
&amp;#34;Mining companies have been crunching the numbers on their operations, taking into account the lower coal prices and rising costs such as labor, transport and new government charges. 
&amp;#34;Margins are being squeezed so mine management teams are taking a worst case scenario. If there were to be further softening of prices then you would expect further cutbacks in the future,&amp;#34; he said. 
According to Caruana, the fall in prices was attributed to both slowing growth in the eurozone and China, along with the entry of the United States and Indonesia into the coal export market. 
&amp;#34;U.S. coal producers have sought out export markets such as China and India because their domestic market has slowed down and it has been switching to gas for power generation. Indonesia has ramped up coal production and exports of thermal coal to supply the Chinese market over the last few years,&amp;#34; he said. 
While demand in the region having lagged due to &amp;#34;sub-optimal&amp;#34; growth, new supply was still preparing to enter the market. 
&amp;#34;For example, in Queensland there are major new projects slated for the Surat and Galilee basins, and in New South Wales ~~state~~ the Gunnedah basin. Added to this are the new coal mining developments in Mongolia,&amp;#34; he said. 
While Chinese officials are now forecasting a recovery, Caruana said a rebound in prices would also require a significant pick up in the U.S. economy or the eurozone. 
&amp;#34;Once the global economic outlook stabilizes, there will be growing demand for coal as a safe and affordable power source for newly emerging economies,&amp;#34; he said. 
Despite environmental concerns, coal still accounts for 40 percent of global electricity needs and absolute consumption is expected to double over the next two decades due to demand from industrializing nations such as China and India. 
&amp;#34;For all the talk about natural gas and renewables, coal unquestionably won the energy race in the first decade of the 21st century,&amp;#34; reported the International Energy Association (IEA). 
Should such growth continue, reports of the death of &amp;#34;King Coal&amp;#34; appear to have been greatly exaggerated, at least for now.


====No U.S. coal exports now—-but they~’d have a massive impact on Asian coal consumption if they increased ====
Thomas M. **Power 12**, Research Professor and Professor Emeritus, Department of Economics, University of Montana; Principal, Power Consulting; February 2012, &amp;#34;The Greenhouse Gas Impact of Exporting Coal from the West Coast: An Economic Analysis,&amp;#34; http://www.sightline.org/wp-content/uploads/downloads/2012/02/Coal-Power-White-Paper.pdf-http://www.sightline.org/wp-content/uploads/downloads/2012/02/Coal-Power-White-Paper.pdf

The cumulative impact of these coal port proposals on coal consumption in Asia could be much larger than even that implied by the two pending proposals. If Arch, Peabody, and other western U.S. coal producers~’ projections of the competitiveness of western coal in Asia are correct, facilitating the opening of the development of West Coast coal ports could have a very large impact on the supply of coal to China and the rest of Asia.  


====Coal export capacity~’s low—-they~’re less than 10% of U.S. production ====
Jon **Sharp 8-31**, investor in natural resource, energy, diversified blue chip stocks, and bonds (not the debate coach), August 31, 2012, &amp;#34;New EPA Regulations Not Driving Coal Demand,&amp;#34; Seeking Alpha, online: http://seekingalpha.com/article/839701-new-epa-regulations-not-driving-coal-demand
Other articles have mentioned exports as a possible bullish driver for coal stocks going forward. There is a question, though, about port capacity: a project of Ambre Energy Ltd, a tightly-held Australian mining company that is making a foray into coal mining and infrastructure in the US, may be instructive.
In 2010 and 2011 Ambre Energy began leasing and developing port infrastructure to handle the export of thermal coal (among other purposes). It was slow going — apparently for air permit and environmental reasons as described on their website. It is difficult to reconcile these projects with the claim that coal export capacity is abundant — if it is indeed abundant, then these ongoing port investments seem very silly.
Additionally, coal exports account for less than 10% of domestic production (domestic

and a rapid increase in port coal export capacity: an unlikely combination.

====Gas prices are rising which will cause switching back to coal from gas generation—-domestic demand will spike next year ====
David **Wagman 11-1**, Power Magazine, 11/1/12, &amp;#34;Coal Burn Rebounds in the Third Quarter, but Economics Still Favor Natural Gas,&amp;#34; http://www.powermag.com/POWERnews/Coal-Burn-Rebounds-in-the-Third-Quarter-but-Economics-Still-Favor-Natural-Gas_5091.html
Natural gas–fired generation gave up some ground to coal during the third quarter, and coal producers are optimistic that higher natural gas prices will benefit coal, especially coal sourced from the Powder River Basin in Wyoming. Even so, at least one Midwest utility expects natural gas to power what could be as much as 1,500 MW of new generating capacity it may add over the next several years. 
&amp;#34;Overall, our generation from natural gas has increased approximately 50% year-to-date,&amp;#34; said Brian X. Tierney, CFO of American Electric Power (AEP) during the company~’s third-quarter earnings conference call last week. With the addition of the Dresden gas-fired facility to AEP~’s existing Waterford and Lawrenceburg plants, the utility~’s combined cycle generation in the East was up 114% for the quarter and 160% for the year-to-date period. 
Tierney said that with year-to-date capacity factors for those plants approaching 
AND
of the third quarter. The utility~’s target is 35 to 40 days. 
Greg Boyce, CEO of Peabody Energy, a major coal producer, told an earnings conference call that his company continues to expect a decline of approximately 120 million tons in coal use for power generation this year. &amp;#34;The worst of this impact has already occurred, with the U.S. down some 100 million tons, mostly from coal-to-gas switching that was front-loaded in the first half of the year,&amp;#34; he said. 
Boyce said that since last spring, natural gas prices have shown &amp;#34;robust&amp;#34; price increases. Weekly gas storage injections remain below average, and prompt gas prices are above %243.50 per million Btu, with the forward strip above %244. He called those factors &amp;#34;favorable&amp;#34; for demand for Powder River Basin and Illinois Basin coal. 
Boyce said Powder River Basin plants are at 70 to 80 days~’ burn, with Central Appalachia above 120 days. Peabody projects an increase in domestic coal consumption of some 40 million to 60 million tons in 2013, which Boyce said would help rebalance stockpiles to more normal levels. 
John Eaves, president and CEO of Arch Coal, told his company~’s earnings conference call that 2011 heating degree days were nearly 25% below normal, which &amp;#34;dramatically impacted&amp;#34; coal and gas demand. He said a near-normal winter this year could lead to a &amp;#34;sizable step down in coal stockpiles&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;meaningful gas-to-coal switching.&amp;#34; The St. Louis–based company remains cautious, however, and is taking steps to manage through a &amp;#34;potentially challenging&amp;#34; 2013, he said.
