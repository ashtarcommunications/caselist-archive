This will not be a replay of the 1930s, but a replay of the 1970s is a serious prospect. The world is in danger of undoing the market reforms of the 1980s and ~’90s that brought unprecedented prosperity, especially to emerging markets outside the West. Like the 1970s, policy backsliding could prolong a severe downturn and compromise eventual recovery. The short-term challenge is to arrest the slide to Big Government at home and creeping protectionism abroad. The medium-term challenge is to get back on track with trade and FDI liberalisation combined with domestic structural reforms – substantial &amp;#34;unﬁnished business&amp;#34; left before the crisis struck. More, not less, markets and globalisation are what the world needs. That is primarily a matter for unilateral action by governments and competitive emulation among them. It can be reinforced by international policy cooperation in the WTO, G20 and other fora, but not too much can be expected of cumbersome global-governance mechanisms. Overall, limits to government intervention and a well-functioning market economy are of a piece with open markets, economic globalisation and international political stability.&#xD;

daily economic intelligence briefing, distilling the security implications of the global crisis. &#xD;
&#xD;
====Clarifying the definition of national security solves tit-for-tat protectionism====&#xD;
**Rosen and Hanemann 09** (Daniel, and Thilo, China~’s Changing Outbound Foreign Direct Investment Profile: Drivers and Policy Implications, June, http://www.iie.com/publications/pb/pb09-14.pdf) Limiting national security concerns in an era of high-value mergers and acquisitions: Chinese OFDI will increasingly target higher-value assets in advanced economies, as commercial competitiveness joins resource security as a first-order motivation. This will increase the temptation for governments and firms in the nations where China invests to use national security arguments to block these new entrants. Worldwide, the commitment to cross-border investment openness is already shaky and protectionist sentiment is on the rise. Potential recipients of Chinese investments must not invoke national security inappropriately and should be more forthright about offlimit sectors. n Grappling with national economic security: Attempts by some US firms and protectionist politicians to expand the US investment review system to include economic security irrespective of national security have been rebuffed in the past. However, China~’s size and pervasive government involvement in its commercial sector are rekindling this debate. Policymakers worry about the impact of noncommercial bidders on a market system, and concerns that official subsidies support China~’s OFDI are pervasive. Talk in Beijing about &amp;#34;using&amp;#34; corporate OFDI as an alternative to buying US treasuries only increases worry about financial security. Corporate bailouts worldwide have lately made China~’s firms less exceptional in terms of government ownership and control, but western officials remain concerned about China in particular. Chinese executives need clear US policy to determine beforehand whether bids may be rejected on national security grounds, and greater clarity on this issue would benefit the United States both by maximizing its asset values and preventing tit-fortat treatment abroad. &#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
====And, Unilateral FDI liberalization is key to prevent trade policy backsliding which dooms global economic recovery.====&#xD;
**Erixon and Sally, directors-ECIPE, 10** (Fredrik and Razeen, European Centre for International Political Economy, TRADE, GLOBALISATION AND EMERGING PROTECTIONISM SINCE THE CRISIS, http://www.ecipe.org/media/publication_pdfs/trade-globalisation-and-emerging-protectionism-since-the-crisis.pdf)    ~~italics are from original source~~ We think Mr. Bentham~’s world-view will cause damage, not only to domestic economies but also to the world trading system. This will not be a replay of the 1930s, but a replay of the 1970s is a serious prospect. The world is in danger of undoing the market reforms of the 1980s and ~’90s that brought unprecedented prosperity, especially to emerging markets outside the West. Like the 1970s, policy backsliding could prolong a severe downturn and compromise eventual recovery. The short-term challenge is to arrest the slide to Big Government at home and creeping protectionism abroad. The medium-term challenge is to get back on track with trade and FDI liberalisation combined with domestic structural reforms – substantial &amp;#34;unﬁnished business&amp;#34; left before the crisis struck. More, not less, markets and globalisation are what the world needs. That is primarily a matter for unilateral action by governments and competitive emulation among them. It can be reinforced by international policy cooperation in the WTO, G20 and other fora, but not too much can be expected of cumbersome global-governance mechanisms. Overall, limits to government intervention and a well-functioning market economy are of a piece with open markets, economic globalisation and international political stability.&#xD;

&#xD;
===Energy Coop Adv===&#xD;
&#xD;
====Advantage 2- Energy Cooperation-====&#xD;
&#xD;
====US-China bilateral relations are on the brink- inevitable conflicts over the US foreign investment process risk shattering the relationship.  US action to clarify which industries and companies can invest sends a strong signal of cooperation towards China.====&#xD;
**Xu 11** (Ting, senior project manager-Bertelsmann Foundation, The Next Big Threat to US-China Ties, July 13, http://thediplomat.com/2011/07/13/the-next-big-threat-to-us-china-ties/)&#xD;
The United States and China have long lobbed verbal grenades across the Pacific, each &#xD;
AND&#xD;
a win-win situation that would also boost Sino-American collaboration.&#xD;
&#xD;
====Scenario 1- US-China Relations====&#xD;
&#xD;
====CFIUS restrictions on Chinese energy investment undermines the economic interdependence that assures peace between US and China.====&#xD;
**Dorn, CATO China specialist, 07** (James, &amp;#34;The Rise of China Engagement or Protectionism? US Policy towards China,&amp;#34; GLOBAL DIALOGUE Volume 9 ● Number 1–2 ● Winter/Spring 2007, http://www.worlddialogue.org/content.php?id=395)&#xD;

====Nuclear war ====&#xD;
**Wittner 11** (Wittner, Emeritus Professor of History at the State University of New York/Albany and former editor of Peace %26 Change, a journal of peace research, &amp;#34;COMMENTARY: Is a Nuclear War with China Possible?,&amp;#34; November 28, http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/13/opinion/avoiding-a-us-china-war.html)&#xD;
While nuclear weapons exist, there remains a danger that they will be used.  &#xD;
AND&#xD;
that of the world, they should be working to encourage these policies.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
====Scenario 2- Iran sanctions====&#xD;
&#xD;
====Lack of Chinese support for Iran sanctions undercuts international pressure.  Removing restrictions on Chinese investment in US oil and gas production is the best way to get them to come around.====&#xD;
**Downs, China fellow at Brookings, 7-19-12** (Erica S. Downs is a fellow at the John L. Thorton China Center at The Brookings Institution, &amp;#34;Getting China to Turn on Iran,&amp;#34; July 19, http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/getting-china-turn-iran-7215)&#xD;

====Two impacts- First- Nuclearization—====&#xD;
&#xD;
====Iranian nuclearization makes nuclear war inevitable in the Middle East- even small conflicts could escalate to all out war. ====&#xD;

The danger posed by the acquisition of nuclear weapons by Iran or North Korea is &#xD;

 In making the case for preventive war as the least bad option, Kroenig &#xD;
AND&#xD;
emphasize that all options, including military action, remain on the table.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
====Second impact- Strikes-====&#xD;
**Israel will strike Iran unless the US gets China on board to tighten sanctions on Iran- officials statements say they will strike by the end of the year. **&#xD;
**The International Herald Tribune 9/1/**12 HEADLINE: Atomic report puts Israel in bind; As Iran draws closer to a red line, Netanyahu finds options are narrow BYLINE: JODI RUDOREN and DAVID E. SANGER&#xD;

====And, tightening sanctions on Iranian oil staves off an Israeli strike on Iran.====&#xD;

Now that the European Union has agreed to impose a ban on oil purchases from &#xD;

====Israel strikes on Iran cause multiple scenarios for nuclear war, CBW use and terrorist attacks.====&#xD;

U.S. massive response – a potential &amp;#34;Armageddon&amp;#34; scenario.&#xD;

====And, strikes don~’t solve prolif and make escalation inevitable- Iran would face use-it-or-lose-it pressure, no hotlines exist, and Iran~’s command-and-control weakness risks unauthorized escalation.====&#xD;
**Kahl 12** (Colin, Senior Fellow at the Center for a New American Security, Not Time to Attack Iran, Foreign Affairs, 00157120, Mar/Apr2012, Vol. 91, Issue 2)&#xD;
Kroenig~’s discussion of timing is not the only misleading part of his article; so &#xD;
AND&#xD;
community would struggle to track or slow Tehran~’s efforts to rebuild its program.&#xD;
&#xD;
====Chinese support for sanctions is the best bet to prevent Israel from striking. ====&#xD;
**Wuthnow 12** (Joel, fellow at the China and the World Program at the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton University, Will China Stop Iran?, March 05, http://thediplomat.com/2012/03/05/will-china-stop-iran/)&#xD;
What might China be asked to do? During Vice President Xi Jinping~’s visit to &#xD;
AND&#xD;
and all the strife that would entail – may well be much worse.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
====Scenario 3- energy security====&#xD;
&#xD;
====Chinese FDI in US energy production is key to stable global energy prices- price spikes are inevitable without interdependence. ====&#xD;
**Xu et al 12** (Ting, with Thieß Petersen and Tianlong Wang, Cash in Hand: Chinese Foreign Direct Investment in the U.S. and Germany, June, &#xD;
http://www.bfna.org/sites/default/files/publications/Cash%20In%20Hand.pdf)&#xD;
In order to maintain the stability of a world energy supply system, Chinese enterprises &#xD;
AND&#xD;
. In this way, Chinese enterprises increasingly seek to engage in FDI.&#xD;
&#xD;
====Price spikes collapse the Chinese and US economies- cooperation is critical.====&#xD;
**Wu, Brookings Visiting Fellow, 08** (Richard Weixing Hu, Advancing Sino-U.S. Energy Cooperation Amid Oil Price Hikes, March, http://www.brookings.edu/research/opinions/2008/03/energy-hu)&#xD;
&#xD;
The high price of oil is hurting the American economy and is also doing harm &#xD;
AND&#xD;
to cooperate rather than confront each other in their pursuit of energy security.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
====Chinese economic collapse causes Asian and Middle East conflict- China will turn outwardly aggressive.====&#xD;
**Newmeyer 09 **DR. JACQUELINE NEWMYER - LONG TERM STRATEGY GROUP- THE CENTER FOR NATIONAL POLICY &amp;#34;ECONOMIC CRISIS: IMPACT ON CHINESE MILITARY MODERNIZATION&amp;#34; APRIL 8, 2009, http://cnponline.org/index.php?ht=a/GetDocumentAction/i/12503&#xD;
 So I think either way, either because of the insecurity that is stoked &#xD;
AND&#xD;
the downturn would lead to a greater chance of conflict abroad for China.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
====And, economic decline causes war.====&#xD;

Less intuitive is how periods of economic decline may increase the likelihood of extern conflict&#xD;
AND&#xD;
not featured prominently in the economic-security debate and deserves more attention.&#xD;

Energy security in the 21st century revolves around the adequacy of and access to supply &#xD;
AND&#xD;
inter-state conflict, as well as regional tensions and instability.&amp;#34;69&#xD;

====Scenario 4- South China Seas====&#xD;
&#xD;
====And, politicization of Chinese energy deals independently undermines US-China energy relations, which causes hostile Chinese naval modernization.====&#xD;

Both the United States and China will benefit if they can develop a collaborative relationship &#xD;

====Chinese naval modernization causes miscalculation, risking conflict with the US. ====&#xD;

In this hearing, witnesses told the Commission that the Chinese People~’s Liberation Army (&#xD;

===Plan===&#xD;
&#xD;
====Thus the plan:====&#xD;
&#xD;
====The United States Federal Government should exclude crude oil and natural gas production from Exon-Florio reviews. ====&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
===Solvency===&#xD;
&#xD;
====Contention 5-Solvency:====&#xD;
&#xD;
====Narrowing the definition of national security to exclude &amp;#34;energy assets&amp;#34; insulates the CFIUS process from protectionist manipulation. ====&#xD;
**Carroll-Emory International Law Review-9** 23 Emory Int~’l L. Rev. 167 COMMENT: BACK TO THE FUTURE: REDEFINING THE FOREIGN INVESTMENT AND NATIONAL SECURITY ACT~’S CONCEPTION OF NATIONAL SECURITY&#xD;
Conclusion Exon-Florio should be amended to more narrowly define national security. The &#xD;
AND&#xD;
by embracing globalization and cooperation can the United States truly achieve national security.&#xD;

====Contention 1- the Status Quo====&#xD;
&#xD;
====The United States currently submits all foreign investment deals related to oil and gas production to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, known as CFIUS.  These restrictions chill foreign investment and send a signal of US protectionism. ====&#xD;

&#xD;
China sits on natural gas reserves that are estimated to be 50% higher than the massive gas reserves in the USA. http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/energy/2012/08/120808-china-shale-gas/. Despite this gargantuan gas resource, coal provides China 80% of its electricity, compared to 34% in the USA, as of May 2012. Why the difference? The shale gas boom that is now more than 10 years long in the USA is just getting started in China and so the Chinese remain heavily reliant on coal to make electricity and for their total energy. Around the world, the basic energy choice is coal or gas. China is just the biggest example of this fundamental fact. China~’s reliance on coal means that its economic growth brings skyrocketing carbon emissions and other air pollution. Indeed, Chinese air quality is infamous around the world, and smog has been so thick that Beijing airport has been unable to land planes for short periods. As of 2011, China was responsible for 29% of the world~’s carbon emissions, while the US produced 16%, even though the US economy is still considerably bigger than China~’s. Moreover, US carbon emissions are declining to 1992 levels, but China~’s emissions skyrocket. Though China is building substantial new wind, solar, and nuclear generation, those investments are not enough to cut Chinese coal consumption, given economic growth that is still 7% in what some describe as an economic slowdown. Shale gas, however, could be big enough to actually displace significant amounts of coal in China. More gas in China means less mercury, soot. lead, smog, and carbon emissions. China~’s energy plans call for shale gas to provide 6% of its total energy as soon as 2020.  If it achieves that goal, China will avoid more than 500 million tons of carbon pollution per year or about 1.5% of today~’s total carbon emissions.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
====Increasing demand for Chinese coal production causes water shortages which threaten economic collapse and political instability. ====&#xD;
**Schneider 11** (Keith, senior editor for Circle of Blue-a nonprofit focusing on resource shortages founded in 2000, Choke Point: China—Confronting Water Scarcity and Energy Demand in the World~’s Largest Country, Feb 15, http://www.circleofblue.org/waternews/2011/world/choke-point-china%E2%80%94confronting-water-scarcity-and-energy-demand-in-the-world%E2%80%99s-largest-country/)&#xD;
By any measure, conventional and otherwise, China~’s tireless advance to international economic prominence &#xD;
AND&#xD;
rising incomes and improving opportunities, is at risk, say some authorities.&#xD;

====Chinese economic collapse causes Asian and Middle East conflict- China will turn outwardly aggressive.====&#xD;

Obama’s decision was likely to be another irritant in the increasingly tense economic relationship between the United States and China. It also comes against an election-year backdrop of intense criticism from Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who accuses Obama of not being tough enough on China.&#xD;
In his decision, Obama ordered Ralls Corp., which is owned by Chinese nationals, to divest its interest in the wind farms that it purchased earlier this year near the Naval Weapons Systems Training Facility in Boardman, Ore.&#xD;

The Treasury Department said in a statement that Obama~’s decision is specific to this transaction and does not set a precedent for other foreign direct investment in the United States by China or any other country.&#xD;
China~’s trade advantage over the United States has emerged as a key issue in the final weeks of the presidential campaign. Obama, in an interview Wednesday with the Cleveland Plain Dealer, said the United States must push hard against Beijing but &amp;#34;not go out of our way to embarrass&amp;#34; China. &amp;#34;We~’re not interested in triggering an all-out trade war that would damage both economies,&amp;#34; he said.&#xD;

&#xD;
China sits on natural gas reserves that are estimated to be 50% higher than the massive gas reserves in the USA. http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/energy/2012/08/120808-china-shale-gas/. Despite this gargantuan gas resource, coal provides China 80% of its electricity, compared to 34% in the USA, as of May 2012. Why the difference? The shale gas boom that is now more than 10 years long in the USA is just getting started in China and so the Chinese remain heavily reliant on coal to make electricity and for their total energy. Around the world, the basic energy choice is coal or gas. China is just the biggest example of this fundamental fact. China~’s reliance on coal means that its economic growth brings skyrocketing carbon emissions and other air pollution. Indeed, Chinese air quality is infamous around the world, and smog has been so thick that Beijing airport has been unable to land planes for short periods. As of 2011, China was responsible for 29% of the world~’s carbon emissions, while the US produced 16%, even though the US economy is still considerably bigger than China~’s. Moreover, US carbon emissions are declining to 1992 levels, but China~’s emissions skyrocket. Though China is building substantial new wind, solar, and nuclear generation, those investments are not enough to cut Chinese coal consumption, given economic growth that is still 7% in what some describe as an economic slowdown. Shale gas, however, could be big enough to actually displace significant amounts of coal in China. More gas in China means less mercury, soot. lead, smog, and carbon emissions. China~’s energy plans call for shale gas to provide 6% of its total energy as soon as 2020.  If it achieves that goal, China will avoid more than 500 million tons of carbon pollution per year or about 1.5% of today~’s total carbon emissions.&#xD;

====Increasing demand for Chinese coal production causes water shortages which threaten economic collapse and political instability. ====&#xD;

By any measure, conventional and otherwise, China~’s tireless advance to international economic prominence &#xD;

If someone expressed the view that a particular ethnic or national group should die off, that person would be condemned, and rightly so. But for some reason, when it comes to the entire human race dying out (including every single ethnic and national group), it becomes much more acceptable.
Seeing how humans on Earth are increasingly being asked to defend our own continued existence, it is no surprise that humans-in-space are continually criticized. But in the spirit of do-more-than-one-thing-at-the-same-time, we should be able to justify human beings both on Earth and in space.

====And, none of their trade offense applies- protectionism is unquestionably bad- best studies.====
**Bhagwati, CFR Senior Fellow, 10** (Jagdish, University Professor of Law and Economics at Columbia University and Senior Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, renowned expert on international trade, he has served as the Special Adviser to the UN on globalization, &amp;#34;How to demolish protectionist myths,&amp;#34; July 5, http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/jul/05/free-trade-protectionist-myths) Evidently, the pessimism and despair that often overwhelms free traders today is unwarranted. The arguments of protectionists, new and old, are just so many myths that can be successfully challenged. Consider some of the most egregious examples. Myth 1: &amp;#34;The cost of protection and its flipside, gains from trade, are negligible.&amp;#34; This means, of course, that if protectionism is politically convenient, you need not shed tears over harming the country by surrendering to it, an attitude that many Democrats in the United States find convenient to adopt. Ironically, this myth was a product of inappropriate methodology and resulted from the research of my eminent Cambridge teacher Harry Johnson; and since 1990 it has inexplicably been a favourite thesis of my celebrated MIT student Paul Krugman. But, while this theme continues to play well in Washington, no serious scholar buys into it, owing to the compelling refutations published in 1992 by Robert Feenstra, the most accomplished trade policy empiricist today, and in 1994 by Stanford~’s Paul Romer. Myth 2: &amp;#34;Free trade may increase economic prosperity, but it is bad for the working class.&amp;#34; This claim has great credibility with labour unions that believe trade with poor countries produces paupers in rich countries. They therefore argue for levelling the playing field – ie, that the costs for their rivals in poor countries must be raised by imposing the same labour standards that exist in rich countries. Orwellian use of terms such as &amp;#34;fair trade&amp;#34; masks the fact that this is nothing but an insidious form of protectionism that seeks to reduce import competition. Many economists have concluded, however, that continual and deep labour-saving technological change, not trade with poor countries, is a principal culprit in the stagnation seen in rich-country wages nowadays. Moreover, workers profit from lower prices for imported goods such as clothing and electronics. Myth 3: &amp;#34;Free trade requires that other countries also open their markets.&amp;#34; This is a refrain that recurs each time a new US administration takes office. But the facts are often fiction, and the logic is not compelling. US automakers were convinced during the years of Japan-bashing in the 1980s that Japan was closed and the US was open. But it was the US that had a quota of 2.2 million units for Japanese cars, while the Japanese market was open, but difficult to penetrate. The refrain is recurring with China today. Even if other economies are closed, open economies still profit from their own free trade. There was skepticism about this long-standing wisdom when it was argued that, if Japan was closed and the US was open, Japanese firms would have two markets and American firms would have one. The former, it was claimed, would have lower unit costs than the latter. But the problem here, as always, is with the assumption that Japanese firms would continue to be as efficient as American firms, despite protectionism. Myth 4: &amp;#34;Paul Samuelson abandoned free trade, and he was the greatest economist of his time.&amp;#34; The latter is indeed true; but the former, asserted by many protectionists, is not. Even Hillary Clinton, in her campaign for the US presidency, mistakenly embraced this fallacy. All that Samuelson showed was that any exogenous change could harm a trading economy; he did not argue that an appropriate response to that unfortunate situation was to abandon free trade. Consider an analogy. If Florida is devastated by a hurricane, its governor would only make matters worse if he responded by abandoning trade with other states. Myth 5: &amp;#34;Offshoring of jobs will devastate rich countries.&amp;#34; This scare arose during Senator John Kerry~’s failed presidential campaign in 2004, when digitised X-rays were sent from Massachusetts General hospital in Boston to be read in India. But no radiologists have lost jobs in the US since then, nor have their earnings fallen. Indeed, it is clear that the increased tradability of services has not unleashed an economic tsunami on rich countries. Often, jobs that would have disappeared anyway, owing to high costs in the US and other rich countries, have resurfaced where costs are lower, thus providing services that would have been lost otherwise. So noted offshoring worriers such as the economist Alan Blinder have now shifted to arguing merely that increased tradability of services means that we should extend long-standing adjustment assistance programmes for trade-distressed activities to include services. To which the free trader responds: no problem there%21

work of having and raising children. VHEMT is the lazy person~’s extinction.
The appeal of VHEMT to its followers is its non-violent, passive approach 
AND
, confining Earth life harms the progress of all life in the universe.


And infinite generations of future lives depend on our choices now – it~’s our job to make the post-human acheivable
Nick Bostrom - Director, Future of Humanity Institute, Oxford University – 2007 &amp;#34;In the Great Silence there is Great Hope&amp;#34; Commissioned for BBC Radio 3 online ~~nfb~~
But we would have some grounds for hope that all or most of the Great 
AND
themselves present and called upon to midwife the conception of such a future. 

1. the 1AC is important- us debating about 

Key to agency and policymaking 
Rawls ~’99 (John, Professor Emeritus – Harvard University, The Law of Peoples, p. 54-7)
Developing the Law of Peoples within a liberal conception of justice, we work out 
AND
, for in that case it would be incompatible with freedom of speech. 

Oppression da: Role-playing as public actors shatters apathy and political alienation, which is critical to check inequality and exploitation
Mitchell ~’2K
(Gordon, Director of Debate and Professor of Communication – U. Pittsburgh, &amp;#34;Simulated Public Argument As Pedagogical Play on Worlds&amp;#34;, Argumentation %26 Advocacy, Vol. 36, No. 3, Winter)
When we assume the posture of the other in dramatic performance, we tap into 
AND
that highlight this component of students~’ self-identities carry significant emancipatory potential.


Elistism da: Policy debates are critical to education about government action, whether you like the state or not –- refusal to debate specific policies cedes the whole discussion to elites
Walt ~’91 (Stephen, Professor – U Chicago, International Studies Quarterly, 35)
A second norm is relevance, a belief that even highly abstract lines of inquiry 
AND
likely when national policy is monopolized by a few self-interested parties.



====—-Their death link arguments radically devalue life by erasing any difference between life and death. Baudrillard~’s fetish for sign~’s and symbols replaces the beauty of biology with nihilism and indifference. ====
**Kellner, 1989 **
Douglas, Philosophy Chair at UCLA, &amp;#34;Jean Baudrillard&amp;#34;, p. 107-8
Yet does the sort of symbolic exchange which Baudrillard advocates really provide a solution to 
AND
trajectory will ultimately lead him to embrace nihilism (see 4.4). 

====—-Death Matters —- Baudrillard~’s account negates life by ignoring the personal reality of death and the subject. ====
**Sobchack 1991**
Vivian,  American cinema and media theorist and cultural critic, &amp;#34; Baudrillard~’s Obscenity,&amp;#34; Science Fiction Studies ~~%2355 = Volume 18, Part 3, November, http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/backissues/55/forum55.htm
There~’s nothing like a little pain to bring us (back) to our senses 
AND
confusions of sex and death that look to apparent resolution by &amp;#34;riddling&amp;#34;




 the imagined body with technologically-conduced holes, that he reads Ballard~’s Crash 
AND
we, like Vaughan, like Baudrillard, will objectify ourselves to death.


==== (A.) Considering human impacts doesn~’t require anthropocentrism —- Prudential and non-prudential justifications are mutually reinforcing.  ====
**Plumwood 2002**
Val, Environmental Culture: The Ecological Crisis of Reason, pg. 129
Similarly, the ideal of avoiding human-centeredness does not imply at all that 
AND
confuse them, and in whose interests it would be to do so). 

==== (B.) Rejecting anthropocentric utilitarianism is counterproductive —- We can use anthropocentric concepts to get others onboard with nonhuman defense and recognition. ====
**Litfin 2003**
Karen, University of Washington, Secularism, Sovereignty and the Challenge of Global Ecology: Towards a New Story, http://www.essex.ac.uk/ECPR/events/jointsessions/paperarchive/grenoble/ws6/litfin.pdf
From any particular worldview comes a specific ethical proclivity. Under the secular worldview, 
AND
stresses our special ethical responsibilities at least as much as our special rights. 


====(A.) Combing anthropocentrism with concern for nonhuman life, even within the framework of instrumental rationality, is the only pragmatic first step towards challenging human domination. ====
**Litfin 2003**
Karen, University of Washington, Secularism, Sovereignty and the Challenge of Global Ecology: Towards a New Story, http://www.essex.ac.uk/ECPR/events/jointsessions/paperarchive/grenoble/ws6/litfin.pdf
A second critical development is the extension of &amp;#34;rights&amp;#34; to nonhuman species, 
AND
full-scale shift towards an integral perspective of the biosphere anytime soon. 

====(B.) The alternatives sudden abandonment of all human management is catastrophic for both human and non human life. This also answers the ~’human extinction good~’ claims that will come out in the block.  ====
**Zizek 2008 **
Slavoj, Violence, or ........ Ecology as a New Opium for the Masses http://www.lacan.com/zizecology2.htm
The lesson to be fully endorsed is thus that of another environmental scientist who came 
AND
obstacle to protecting nature is the very notion of nature we rely on.

====—- Anthropocentrism is inevitable and we solve your offense —- It~’s the only way to address non-human concerns and the alternative is complete indifference to environmental protection issues.  ====
**Parker 1996**
Kelly, Professor of Philosophy, Grand Valley State University, Environmental Pragmatism Ed. Light and Katz, pg.32-33
The debate over anthropocentrism is especially tendentious. The question concerns the primary locus of 
AND
shameful. It is, after all, the only way to go.


====—-Reality shapes discourse —- Materiality is a prerequisite to discursive construction.  ====
**Roskoski %26 Peabody 1991**
Matthew, Joe, &amp;#34;A Linguistic and Philosophical Critique of Language ~’Arguments,~’&amp;#34; http://debate.uvm.edu/Library/ DebateTheoryLibrary/Roskoski%26Peabody-LangCritiques
The first is that the hypothesis is phrased as a philosophical first principle and hence 
AND
other, more abstract, entities and their names. (Rosch 264).

====—-Case preceeds discourse —- Understanding structures and politics is more important as they shape and define linguistic meaning. ====
**Tuathail 1996**
Gearoid, Professor of Geography at Virginia Polytechnic Institute, Political Geography, Vol 15 No 6-7, p. 664, Science Direct
While theoretical debates at academic conferences  are important to academics, the discourse and concerns 
AND
needs to always be open to the patterned mess that is  human history.


====—-The alternative and link claims are impossibly elitist —- It presupposes support from a position of privilege where the rejection of modern culture can be seen as an intellectual achievement rather than a material travesty; guaranteeing the average worker looses their morgage, job, home and eventually even their family. ====
**Racevskis 1979 **
Karlis, French Professor at Wright State University.  &amp;#34;The Theoretical Violence of a Catastrophical Strategy,&amp;#34; Diacritics 9:3
The rejection of culture is a privilege that is not enjoyed by many: while 
AND
well appear more attractive than this primordial spontaneity set loose by the Symbolic.

====—-Baudrillard~’s rejection of a material basis for politics is a double turn; creating a single essentialist code of signs and symbols effectively masking structures of oppression. Their link and impact claims are only true in &amp;#34;Baudrillard world&amp;#34; not the one described by the affirmative. ====
**MacCannel %26 MacCannel 2003 **
Dean, Professor of Applied Behavior Science and Sociology at the University of California, Davis, and, Juliet Flower, Professor of English and Director of the Program in Comparative Literature at the University of California, Irvine, &amp;#34;Social class in postmodernity,&amp;#34; Forget Baudrillard? pg. 141-143
We are suggesting that Baudrillard took his analysis of the simulacrum up to the site 
AND
, its reduction, and abject resignation in the face of The Real.

====—-Baudrillard concedes this and has already voted aff —- He explicitly repudiates his early work due to an overemphasis on the negative impact of mass-culture and lack of viable alternative. ====
**Zurbrugg 2000 **
Nicholas, Critical vices: the myths of postmodern theory, pg 125
More specifically, Baudrillard~’s arguments successively repudiate the logic of Enlightenment modernism, consciously or 
AND
form of analysis – a more subtle form of analysis than that one.&amp;#34;

====—-Permutation Do Both —- Embrace the strategy of the Object and do the plan.====

====—-Permutation solves best while avoiding the advantage impacts —- Independent reality exists and humans have at least some access to it. The fact that Baudrillard can communicate the problems with things like Disneyland at all implies a concrete reality we can compare it to. ====
**Marsh 1995**
James, Professor of Philosophy at Fordham University, Critique, Action, and Liberation, p. 292-293
Such an account, however, is as one-sided or perhaps even more 
AND
, and on media such as movies, television, and radio.7 

====—-Independent reality exists and humans have at least some access to it —- The fact that Baudrillard can communicate the problems with things like Disneyland at all implies a reality we can compare it to. Their claims are essentialize the media and ignore it~’s potential to facilitate a truly democratic public sphere. ====
