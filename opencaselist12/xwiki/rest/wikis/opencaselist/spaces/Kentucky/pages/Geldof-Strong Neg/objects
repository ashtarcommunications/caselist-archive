Conceded the hillyard ev- independent extinction event- assumption of PRODUCTION and not consumptive patterns make extinction inevitable. 
~-~--National energy policy debates are located within a false methodology of a unified energy system which eliminates consumptive limits. The affirmative’s imagination of future energy production is a coping mechanism for anxiety over impending catastrophe. If all energy inputs are connected then political context becomes irrelevant and a future of utopian abundance is merely a question of planning proper technocratic management.

The roll of the ballot is to vote for the best act of knowledge production, the judge is a critic of argument~-~--this is best, 
a.) debate realism: the plan won’t happen if you vote aff, all you are doing is endorsing a particular educational model, the only portable skill we get from debate is advocacy skills, voting aff means they are doing the better advocating for change, voting neg means they are doing a bad job. 
If we win any of our link arguments it means they are not doing the better debating because they train us to be good energy forecasters for shell oil which is bad, they assume energy is a homogenous entity where any combination of interchange can occur, that causes energy shortages, resource wars and serial policy failure.  
b.) the political Our links also turn their policy making good offense, they will result in bad policies and collapse the political by having a solely supply based solution to the energy problem, assuming the only thing that need be changed out of our consumption, infrastructure and mindset problems is our supply brackets off key political discussions and deemphasizes genuine contestation. 
c.) A focus on policy relevance precludes the structural change necessary to establish energy security for more than just the privileged few.
