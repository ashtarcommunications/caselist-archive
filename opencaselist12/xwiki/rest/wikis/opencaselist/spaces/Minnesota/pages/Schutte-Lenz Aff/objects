Warming is real and human caused – there are multiple factors proving this

ONE, scientific consensus proves fossil fuel use drives warming
Richard Somerville, Distinguished Professor Emeritus at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and Climate Scientist, PhD in Meteorology, 3/8/11, House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Energy and Power Hearing; &amp;#34;Climate Science and EPA&amp;#39;s Greenhouse Gas Regulations”, Congressional Testimony, lexis, mnrs

The Working Group One (physical science) part of AR4 was written by 152 
AND
a similar warming trend in the upper troposphere, consistent with model results.

TWO, environmental signs prove fossil fuels are driving it, we’re approaching a tipping point
Richard Somerville, Distinguished Professor Emeritus at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and Climate Scientist, PhD in Meteorology, 3/8/11, House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Energy and Power Hearing; &amp;#34;Climate Science and EPA&amp;#39;s Greenhouse Gas Regulations”, Congressional Testimony, lexis, mnrs

According to The Copenhagen Diagnosis (Allison et al. 2009), the most significant 
AND
could mean that some tipping points will be crossed before they are recognized. 


THREE, recent stastical models prove CO2 is entirely responsible
Richard A. Muller, professor of physics at the University of California, Berkeley, and a former MacArthur Foundation fellow, 7/28/12, “The Conversion of a Climate-Change Skeptic”, http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/30/opinion/the-conversion-of-a-climate-change-skeptic.html, mnrs

CALL me a converted skeptic. Three years ago I identified problems in previous climate

we demonstrate that none of these potentially troublesome effects unduly biased our conclusions.

That risks massive feedback loops that causes the loss of all Earth life

Warming disproportionately affects minorities – the US has an obligation to limit fossil fuel emissions

Solvency: 1AC

Plan: The United States federal government should substantially increase financial incentives for decentralized and residential energy production of solar power. 

The plan solves – increasing access for decentralized solar power is key to a renewable shift
The Institute for Local Self-Reliance 2K8 (John Farrell, Research Associate @ The Institute for Local Self-Reliance, “Concentrating Solar and Decentralized Power: Government Incentives Hinder Local Ownership,” May 2008, The New Rules Project, Online)

Solar concentrators promise a new level of development for clean electric power in the United 
AND
. Reaping these benefits means establishing fair policies for encouraging solar power development.

Decentralized solar disrupts the fossil fuel industry control over energy
Hermann Scheer, member of the German Parliament and Alternative Nobel Prize winner, 2002, “The Solar Economy: Renewable Energy for a Sustainable Global Future”, Earthscan, p. 87-89, mnrs

The representatives of the fossil energy industry have been written out of the script for 
AND
dependency and from the webs spun by the spiders of the fossil economy.

The solar manufacturing process itself disrupts fossil fuel control – it provides a way to opt-out of the system
Hermann Scheer, member of the German Parliament and Alternative Nobel Prize winner, 2002, “The Solar Economy: Renewable Energy for a Sustainable Global Future”, Earthscan, p. 84-86, mnrs

The dynamics of the drive towards business concentration is thought to be the dominant force 
AND
by the national grid, to the point at which it becomes superfluous. 

The solar production chain is clean and feasible
Hermann Scheer, member of the German Parliament and Alternative Nobel Prize winner, 2002, “The Solar Economy: Renewable Energy for a Sustainable Global Future”, Earthscan, p. 74-75, mnrs

In this case, the supply chain begins with the installed solar panel, which

Solar power is sufficient to solve

One of the most common arguments against large-scale use of renewable energy is 
AND
to not just produce peak power, but also generate base load electricity.

Using the state is key – anything else cedes to the fossil fuel industry
Hermann Scheer, member of the German Parliament and Alternative Nobel Prize winner, 2002, “The Solar Economy: Renewable Energy for a Sustainable Global Future”, Earthscan, p. 250, mnrs

Which initiatives are capable of side-stepping or overcoming existing structural obstacles in order 
AND
will become indispensable – and then achievable – tomorrow or the day after.

Political change is key to spark a transition
Hermann Scheer, member of the German Parliament and Alternative Nobel Prize winner, 2002, “The Solar Economy: Renewable Energy for a Sustainable Global Future”, Earthscan, p. xv, mnrs

History provides many examples of technological revolutions that have reshaped the world. None have 
AND

We have a good method and epistemology – science and empiricism are the only ways to solve multiple extinction threats
Coyne, 06 – Author and Writer for the Times (Jerry A., “A plea for empiricism”, FOLLIES OF THE WISE, Dissenting essays, 405pp. Emeryville, CA: Shoemaker and Hoard, 1 59376 101 5)

Supernatural forces and events, essential aspects of most religions, play no role in 
AND
politics and religion, we desperately need to heed Crews’s plea for empiricism.

Reinjecting science into policymaking is key to check conservative takeover and climate denialism
Robin McKie, science editor, 2/18/12, “Attacks paid for by big business are &amp;#39;driving science into a dark era&amp;#39;”, http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2012/feb/19/science-scepticism-usdomesticpolicy, mnrs

Most scientists, on achieving high office, keep their public remarks to the bland 
AND
they should be guided by lobbyists who appear driven by narrow ideological dogma.

Rejecting science as subjective makes policy deliberation a political game of cooption 
Banning, 9 – University of Colorado communication professor, PhD (Marlia Elisabeth, “When Poststructural Theory and Contemporary Politics Collide*The Vexed Case of Global Warming,” Communication and Critical/Cultural Studies, Vol. 6, No. 3, September 2009, pp. 285-304

While academic research practices and the knowledge these produce have not changed substantially60 in the

political, ’’ the relations of power and antagonism that define public discourse.

A renewables transition is key to solve warming
Jeremy Rifkin, adviser to the European Union for the past decade and is the principle architect of the European Union’s Third Industrial Revolution Plan, 2/14/12, “The third industrial revolution”, Making It, http://www.makingitmagazine.net/?p=4514, mnrs

Our industrial civilization is at a crossroads. Oil and the other fossil fuel energies

Renewables are key to any political transition

A new economic paradigm  The creation of a renewable energy regime, loaded by buildings

possibilities that lie ahead and muster the will to get there in time.

Decisionmaking skills learned from debate over energy issues are key to actualizing political change
