The call for sustainable development implicitly posits that robust stocks of natural resources are crucial &#xD;
AND&#xD;

&#xD;
&#xD;
====Growth is sustainable and self-correcting – empirically proven ====&#xD;
**Goldberg, AEI visiting fellow, 6-10-11**&#xD;
(Jonah, &amp;#34;Simply Madness,&amp;#34; http://www.aei.org/article/103708, accessed 6-11-11, CMM)&#xD;
&#xD;
&amp;#34;Live simply so that others may simply live,&amp;#34; Gandhi famously proclaimed.&#xD;
Some vegetarians see their diet as the truest expression of Gandhi~’s advice. But these days, the slogan has been embraced most passionately by those who wish to say goodbye to economic growth.&#xD;
That~’s not an exaggeration. The so-called &amp;#34;steady-state economy&amp;#34; movement holds that &amp;#34;we will have to get beyond growth as a society in order to realize a sustainable future.&amp;#34;&#xD;
That~’s from the website steadystaterevolution.org. Its logo features a typical jagged trend line (representing the traditional ups and downs of economic progress) that suddenly flatlines at a high level, sort of like what an EKG would look like if you had a heart attack and died while jogging (death, after all, is the steadiest of states).&#xD;
The idea behind the steady-state economy should be familiar to anyone who~’s heard the lament that capitalism is bad for the environment because it rapaciously consumes resources faster than they can be replaced.&#xD;
It~’s an ancient idea, really, a kind of millenarian paranoia that keeps getting gussied up to fit the latest headlines. My favorite example is the 1968 book The Population Bomb by Paul R. Ehrlich. &amp;#34;The battle to feed all of humanity is over,&amp;#34; prophesized Ehrlich. &amp;#34;In the 1970s hundreds of millions of people will starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked upon now.&amp;#34;&#xD;
It was a &amp;#34;certainty&amp;#34; that even in America, famine would claim millions. Ehrlich desperately claims that his predictions were mostly right and that hundreds of millions of people did indeed die of hunger over the ensuing decades. That~’s not exactly true. Global population has doubled, and the amount of food available for humanity has grown as well.&#xD;
But, yes, people have died of hunger since 1968. Why? It wasn~’t because markets failed or resources ran out. It was because government planners failed. That~’s why countries such as India and China have introduced markets: Their central planning was killing their own people.&#xD;
A few years ago, a special issue of New Scientist magazine was dedicated to the steady-state economy. In it, Herman Daly, a leading guru behind the movement, explained that in his new ideal &amp;#34;sustainable economy,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;scientists set the rules.&amp;#34;&#xD;
Translation: If the ecologists don~’t like an idea, that idea is out. Daly~’s hardly the only person out there imagining a kind of Plato~’s Republic where the philosopher-kings are replaced with environmental and climate scientists. The 2007 book The Climate Change Challenge and the Failure of Democracy makes a similar argument, though its enemy is liberal democracy rather than economic growth.&#xD;
Either way, the problem becomes clear: When people start talking about capping, halting, or managing economic growth, what they really mean is capping, halting, and managing freedom. Hence Thomas Friedman, New York Times columnist and avowed envier of China~’s authoritarian regime, declares that &amp;#34;The Earth Is Full&amp;#34; and we must therefore embrace a version of the steady-state economy.&#xD;
Economic growth is an enemy of all central planners for the simple reason that growth jumps the guardrails of The Plan; it changes the aesthetically appealing flat line of the steady state and makes it jagged. Growth creates new products, destroys old ones, and allows people to behave in ways that render PowerPoint projections dismayingly obsolete. Worse, it takes power from the planners.&#xD;
In order to herd people back onto the official path, planners must tell them that what exists outside the guardrails is too terrifying to contemplate. &amp;#34;Beyond here there be monsters&amp;#34; is the posted sign at every guardrail.&#xD;
For the record, America has more forests than it did a century ago. Our air, water, and food are cleaner than at any time since industrialization. That is not because we lived simply, but because we pursued economic growth and accumulated the wealth and expertise to mend our problems. Over the long run, the same pattern holds true for every country that embraces economic growth.&#xD;
That~’s why climate change is such a useful bogeyman: It is non-falsifiable, at least in our lifetimes. The &amp;#34;scientists set the rules,&amp;#34; and there~’s no room for appeal. And— surprise%21— in order to avoid catastrophe, the same old adages apply.&#xD;
&amp;#34;Live simply so that others may simply live&amp;#34; has never made any sense save in this light. To live simply means to live predictably— predictably poor (or to not live at all). When India came closest to following Gandhi~’s mantra, untold millions lived and died— albeit &amp;#34;simply&amp;#34;%21— in abject poverty.&#xD;
What America needs desperately today is massive economic growth. That~’s what will pay off our debt, sustain our entitlements, and continue to improve the environment. Almost as important, it will annoy all the right people.&#xD;

&#xD;
What do these trends mean in the short and medium term? The Great Depression &#xD;
AND&#xD;
globe, and the concurrent decline of trust in free-market systems.&#xD;
The threat of instability is a pressing concern. China, until last year the &#xD;
AND&#xD;
people or diverting their energies outward, leading to conflict with China~’s neighbors.&#xD;
Russia, an oil state completely dependent on energy sales, has had to put down riots in its Far East as well as in downtown Moscow. Vladimir Putin~’s rule has been predicated on squeezing civil liberties while providing economic largesse. If that devil~’s bargain falls apart, then wide-scale repression inside Russia, along with a continuing threatening posture toward Russia~’s neighbors, is likely.&#xD;
Even apparently stable societies face increasing risk and the threat of internal or possibly external conflict. As Japan~’s exports have plummeted by nearly 50%, one-third of the country~’s prefectures have passed emergency economic stabilization plans. Hundreds of thousands of temporary employees hired during the first part of this decade are being laid off.&#xD;
Spain~’s unemployment rate is expected to climb to nearly 20% by the end of 2010; Spanish unions are already protesting the lack of jobs, and the specter of violence, as occurred in the 1980s, is haunting the country. Meanwhile, in Greece, workers have already taken to the streets.&#xD;
Europe as a whole will face dangerously increasing tensions between native citizens and immigrants, largely from poorer Muslim nations, who have increased the labor pool in the past several decades. Spain has absorbed five million immigrants since 1999, while nearly 9% of Germany~’s residents have foreign citizenship, including almost 2 million Turks. The xenophobic labor strikes in the U.K. do not bode well for the rest of Europe.&#xD;
A prolonged global downturn, let alone a collapse, would dramatically raise tensions inside these countries. Couple that with possible protectionist legislation in the United States, unresolved ethnic and territorial disputes in all regions of the globe and a loss of confidence that world leaders actually know what they are doing. The result may be a series of small explosions that coalesce into a big bang.&#xD;

Today, economic and fiscal trends pose the most severe long-term threat to the United States~’ position as global leader. While the United States suffers from fiscal imbalances and low economic growth, the economies of rival powers are developing rapidly. The continuation of these two trends could lead to a shift from American primacy toward a multi-polar global system, leading in turn to increased geopolitical rivalry and  even war among the great powers.&#xD;
The current recession is the result of a deep financial crisis, not a mere &#xD;
AND&#xD;
debt  rose from 38 to over 60 percent of GDP in three years.&#xD;
Without faster economic growth and actions to reduce deficits, publicly held national debt is &#xD;
AND&#xD;
that would almost certainly compel a radical retrenchment of the United States internationally.&#xD;
Such scenarios would reshape the international order. It was the economic devastation of Britain &#xD;
AND&#xD;
be compelled to retrench, reducing its military spending and shedding international commitments.&#xD;
We face this domestic challenge while other major powers are experiencing rapid economic growth. &#xD;
AND&#xD;
preclude or respond to international crises because of the higher risk of escalation.&#xD;
The stakes are high. In modern history, the longest period of peace among the great powers has been the era of U.S. leadership. By contrast, multi-polar systems have been unstable, with their competitive dynamics resulting in frequent crises and major wars among the great powers. Failures of multi-polar international systems produced both world wars.&#xD;
American retrenchment could have devastating consequences. Without an American security blanket, regional powers &#xD;
AND&#xD;
, hostile states would be emboldened to make aggressive moves in their regions.&#xD;
As rival powers rise, Asia in particular is likely to emerge as a zone &#xD;
AND&#xD;
the United States is the most significant barrier facing Chinese hegemony and aggression.&#xD;
Given the risks, the United States must focus on restoring its economic and fiscal &#xD;
AND&#xD;
to work our way through the kind of crisis that we face today.&#xD;

2. FINANCIAL INCENTIVES Federal and state governments have frequently used direct and indirect incentives to mobilize private sector investment in projects and to advance policy objectives in numerous sectors of the economy. Types of direct incentives have included tax-based incentives, loan guarantees, and other forms of direct government participation such as grants. Indirect incentives can also be valuable tools for mobilizing private sector investment, such as permitting acceleration, and other indirect forms of risk sharing.

But Becerra, like most lawmakers involved in the effort, is cognizant of the
