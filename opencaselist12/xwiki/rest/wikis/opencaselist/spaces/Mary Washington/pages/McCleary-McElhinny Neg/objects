A. Definition – the “United States Federal Government” is the legislative, judicial, and executive branches.&#xD;
USA.gov, the U.S. government&amp;#39;s official web portal, 9&#xD;
(“U.S. Federal Government”, http://www.usa.gov/Agencies/federal.shtml, accessed 7-29-9)&#xD;
&#xD;
U.S. Federal Government¶  AND U.S. government&amp;#39;s branches.&#xD;
&#xD;
And, “Its” is a possessive determiner – they indicate possession of the noun they modify – in this case, the energy policy that is possessed by the United States Federal Government&#xD;
Kosur, Language Learning Channel contributing editor and Illinois State University Milner Library conservation technician, 9&#xD;
(Heather Marie, 6-16-9, “The Forms and Function of Determiners in English”,&#xD;

&#xD;
Possessive Determiners¶ The second grammatical form of the determiner in English is the possessive&#xD;
AND&#xD;
are also referred to as possessive adjectives and sometimes incorrectly called possessive pronouns.&#xD;
&#xD;
And, “should” implies a call to action&#xD;

&#xD;
3. must; ought (used to indicate duty, propriety, or expediency): You should not do that.&#xD;
&#xD;
B. Violation – the aff doesn’t defend an increase in US federal government’s incentives for energy or reduction in restrictions.&#xD;
C. Fairness– &#xD;
&#xD;
    Predictable ground – USFG action is critical to all negative strategies – there are an infinite amount of non-policy advocacies that are impossible to predict – USFG is key to all generic negative arguments.&#xD;
    2. Aff conditionality- only a resolutionally-based plan prevents shifting advocacies- their framework allows aff vagueness, allowing the aff to become a moving target which destroys discussion, advocacy skills and fair ground.&#xD;
    D. Impacts – &#xD;
    Unpredictable or unfair debates preclude an informed discussion that rigorously tests the efficacy of their approach- this collapses civic deliberation because it prevents informed clash. This outweighs all other impacts - fairness is a prerequisite for voting for one team’s arguments or advocacy over the other’s - because we can’t test the truth-value of an argument or advocacy without rigorously testing it.&#xD;
    2. Predictability is the key starting point for discussion&#xD;
    Shively, former Texas AandM political science assistant professor, 2000&#xD;
    Ruth, Political Theory and Partisan Politics, edited by Portis, Gundersen, and Shively, “Political Theory and the Postmodern Politics of Ambiguity,” 181-2&#xD;
&#xD;
The requirements given thus far are primarily negative. The ambiguists must say “no&#xD;
AND&#xD;
. In other words, contestation rests on some basic agreement or harmony.&#xD;
3. Fairness is key to education- agreed fundamental rules are essential to prevent political debates from devolving into irresolvable ideological disputes- their framework guarantees resistance and hostility&#xD;
Portis, Gunderson and Shively, Texas AandM political science professors, 2000&#xD;
Edward Bryan, Adolf G., and Ruth Lessl, Political Theory and Partisan Politics, 2-3&#xD;
&#xD;
By extension, partisan divisions based upon competing constellations of interests, such as class&#xD;
AND&#xD;
framework provides criteria by which coherence might be assessed and alternative positions evaluated.&#xD;
4. Evaluating between policy options is key to real world education about possible reforms- their interpretation devastates learning about the real world.  The inherent vagueness of their broad advocacy statements and lack of analysis of mechanisms, actors and implementation destroy reciprocal and coherent deliberation about the merits of an idea- a resolutionally-based policy focus is key to rigorous testing of ideas.&#xD;
5. Topical version of the aff solves – advocating USFG action solves their offense while avoiding ours. </headline></objectSummary><objectSummary><link rel="http://www.xwiki.org/rel/object" href="http://opencaselist.paperlessdebate.com/xwiki/rest/wikis/opencaselist/spaces/Mary%20Washington/pages/McCleary-McElhinny%20Neg/objects/Admin.EntryClass/1"/><link rel="http://www.xwiki.org/rel/properties" href="http://opencaselist.paperlessdebate.com/xwiki/rest/wikis/opencaselist/spaces/Mary%20Washington/pages/McCleary-McElhinny%20Neg/objects/Admin.EntryClass/1/properties"/><id>opencaselist:Mary Washington.McCleary-McElhinny Neg:2cb38816-c26e-4be5-8383-de503b8c3c49</id><guid>2cb38816-c26e-4be5-8383-de503b8c3c49</guid><pageId>opencaselist:Mary Washington.McCleary-McElhinny Neg</pageId><wiki>opencaselist</wiki><space>Mary Washington</space><pageName>McCleary-McElhinny Neg</pageName><className>Admin.EntryClass</className><number>1</number><headline>1NC Policymaking DA&#xD;

B. Impact – This year’s resolutions provides us with the important opportunity of discussing U.S. energy policy, which is directly tied the increasing environmental problems of the status quo.

Utterance is an inter-, and intra-, personal dialogue.  Our speech acts build on one another and create the situatedness of the individual in the whole of Being.  What we say now builds on what we have said and what we will say, shaping the potentiality of responsiveness.  It from this this contextual interconnectedness that the ethical emerges.  
Zappen, Missouri Communication Professor, no date James P., Mikhail Bakhtin, Forthcoming (with editorial revisions) in Twentieth-Century Rhetorics and Rhetoricians. Ed. Michael G. Moran and Michelle Ballif, http://homepages.rpi.edu/~zappenj/Publications/Texts/bakhtin.html

Bakhtin&amp;#39;s early ethical work is … productive life of culture&amp;#34; (2). 

The affirmative’s speech acts emerges from and with prior speech acts.  The way that the here and now is understood cannot be decontextualized from the pre-existing meaning and communicative pathways that they have embarked upon.  Their failure to take account for the ethically revelatory nature of the whole discounts what they do here today.  

The utterance of the 1AC and its call to engage in a radical embrace of alterity (add explanation relative to the 1AC) is constrained by their utterances of the past and reveals their ethical positionality.  Specifically, we note the utterances of Harvard at the Dartmouth Round Robin, specifically Round 3 versus Northwestern, as antithetical to the utterances of today. In that debate Harvard advocated adoption of compensatory takings for wind rights and justified the plan with advantages based on the supreme value of pharmaceutical patent protection and corporate/investor rights to sue the state over regulatory action thru investment treaties.  These utterances stand is diametrically opposed to the speech acts of today.  They demonstrate a willingness to “play the game” in a moment of weakness – they embody a refusal to look into the sun at a key moment of opportunity.

It is our argument that willingness to embrace polemic exposes the ethicality of the affirmative and that you should vote negative against their verbalistic word play.
