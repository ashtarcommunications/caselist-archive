==== Framework ====

A. Definition – the “United States Federal Government” is the legislative, judicial, and executive branches.
USA.gov, the U.S. government&amp;#39;s official web portal, 9
(“U.S. Federal Government”, http://www.usa.gov/Agencies/federal.shtml, accessed 7-29-9)

U.S. Federal Government¶  AND U.S. government&amp;#39;s branches.

And, “Its” is a possessive determiner – they indicate possession of the noun they modify – in this case, the energy policy that is possessed by the United States Federal Government
Kosur, Language Learning Channel contributing editor and Illinois State University Milner Library conservation technician, 9
(Heather Marie, 6-16-9, “The Forms and Function of Determiners in English”, 
http://www.brighthub.com/education/languages/articles/36828.aspx, accessed 9-7-9)

Possessive Determiners¶ The second grammatical form of the determiner in English is the possessive 
AND
are also referred to as possessive adjectives and sometimes incorrectly called possessive pronouns.

And, “should” implies a call to action
Dictionary.com
(&amp;#34;should.&amp;#34; Dictionary.com Unabridged (v 1.1). Random House, 
http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/should, accessed 9-9-9)

3. must; ought (used to indicate duty, propriety, or expediency): You should not do that.

B. Violation – the aff doesn’t defend an increase in US federal government’s incentives for energy or reduction in restrictions. 
C. Fairness– 

1. Predictable ground – USFG action is critical to all negative strategies – there are an infinite amount of non-policy advocacies that are impossible to predict – USFG is key to all generic negative arguments. 
2. Aff conditionality- only a resolutionally-based plan prevents shifting advocacies- their framework allows aff vagueness, allowing the aff to become a moving target which destroys discussion, advocacy skills and fair ground.
D. Impacts – 
1. Unpredictable or unfair debates preclude an informed discussion that rigorously tests the efficacy of their approach- this collapses civic deliberation because it prevents informed clash. This outweighs all other impacts - fairness is a prerequisite for voting for one team’s arguments or advocacy over the other’s - because we can’t test the truth-value of an argument or advocacy without rigorously testing it.
2. Predictability is the key starting point for discussion
Shively, former Texas AandM political science assistant professor, 2000
[Ruth, Political Theory and Partisan Politics, edited by Portis, Gundersen, and Shively, “Political Theory and the Postmodern Politics of Ambiguity,” 181-2]

The requirements given thus far are primarily negative. The ambiguists must say “no
AND
. In other words, contestation rests on some basic agreement or harmony.
3. Fairness is key to education- agreed fundamental rules are essential to prevent political debates from devolving into irresolvable ideological disputes- their framework guarantees resistance and hostility
Portis, Gunderson and Shively, Texas AandM political science professors, 2000
[Edward Bryan, Adolf G., and Ruth Lessl, Political Theory and Partisan Politics, 2-3]

By extension, partisan divisions based upon competing constellations of interests, such as class 
AND
framework provides criteria by which coherence might be assessed and alternative positions evaluated. 
4. Evaluating between policy options is key to real world education about possible reforms- their interpretation devastates learning about the real world.  The inherent vagueness of their broad advocacy statements and lack of analysis of mechanisms, actors and implementation destroy reciprocal and coherent deliberation about the merits of an idea- a resolutionally-based policy focus is key to rigorous testing of ideas.
5. Topical version of the aff solves – advocating USFG action solves their offense while avoiding ours.

A. Links –

1. Engaging in theoretical philosophy only meant to persuade those in the room without any call to action outside of it creates a spectator mentality – it undermines all action to end human misery and change political structures
David E. McClean, New School University Professor, and Society for the Study of Africana Philosophy President, 2001, “The Cultural Left and the Limits of Social Hope,” http://www.american-philosophy.org/archives/past_conference_programs/pc2001/Discussion%20papers/david_mcclean.htm

Yet for some reason, at least partially explicated in Richard Rorty&amp;#39;s Achieving Our Country
AND
critics with their snobish disrespect for the so-called &amp;#34;managerial class.&amp;#34;
2. This distracts us from more important work for policy pragmatism – the aff’s inaccessible abstract musings will not create change and allow us to think all of our troubles away
Johnston, Emory University, 2004
[Adrian, &amp;#34;The Cynic&amp;#39;s Fetish: Slavoj Zizek and the Dynamics of Belief,&amp;#34; http://www.scribd.com/doc/20244451/Johnston-a-The-Cynic-s-Fetish-Slavoj-Zizek-and-the-Dynamics-of-Belief, 1/1]

However, the absence of this type of Lacan-underwritten argument in Žiž

whose underlying complicity with the  present state of affairs he describes so well. 
3. Environmentalism fails when focused on the individual level – debating policy proposals grounded in institutional awareness is key to change. 
Maniates, Professor of Political Science and Environmental Science at Allegheny College, 1
(Michael, “Individualization: Plant a Tree, Buy a Bike, Save the World?,” Global Environmental Politics 1:3, August 2001, http://merlin.allegheny.edu/employee/m/mmaniate/savetheworld.pdf, page 32-33, accessed 6-20-12, CMM)

Mark Dowie, a journalist and sometimes historian of the American environmental movement, writes 
AND
impact” = “population” x “affluence” x “technology.”

Any environmental strategy that fails to activate political forces will fail – only state action produces effective change.
Maniates, Professor of Political Science and Environmental Science at Allegheny College, 1
(Michael, “Individualization: Plant a Tree, Buy a Bike, Save the World?,” Global Environmental Politics 1:3, August 2001, http://merlin.allegheny.edu/employee/m/mmaniate/savetheworld.pdf, page 32-33, accessed 6-20-12, CMM)

And yet mainstream environmentalism has not always advanced an individualized consumeristic strategy for redressing environmental 
AND
they were lovely visionaries, naive about the forces that confronted them.22

B. Impact – This year’s resolutions provides us with the important opportunity of discussing U.S. energy policy, which is directly tied the increasing environmental problems of the status quo. The potential for education on this topic in the university space and the skills taught in debate are uniquely key to achieving environmental sustainability – otherwise, extinction is inevitable.
Segalàsa et al, UNESCO Chair of Sustainability, Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain, 10
(J., D. Ferrer-Balasb, Centre for Sustainability, Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain, K.F. Mulderc, Technology Dynamics and Sustainable Development, Delft University of Technology, Delft, the Netherlands, “What do engineering students learn in sustainability courses? The effect of the pedagogical approach,” Journal of Cleaner Production, Volume 18, Issue 3, February 2010, Pages 275–284, Science Direct, accessed 6-12-12, CMM)

There are a considerable number of signs suggesting that our industrialised society might eventually cause 
AND
work within transdisciplinary frameworks and to develop values consistent with the sustainability paradigm.
