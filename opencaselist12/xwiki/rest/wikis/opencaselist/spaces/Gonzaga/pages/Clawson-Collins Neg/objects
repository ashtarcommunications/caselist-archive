The root causes of ecological problems are found in social hierarchies. Their misidentification of the causes of the ecological crisis means they can never solve.
Bookchin 93 (Murray, “What is Social Ecology?”, orig. published in Environmental Philosophy: From Animal Rights to Radical Ecology, ed. Michael Zimmerman, http://greenfrombelow.wordpress.com/murray-bookchin-what-is-social-ecology/)

What defines social ecology as social … attainment is more cosmetic than curative.

B. Single-issue reforms fail, and only create the impression that the system can rectify its own abuses, strengthening and legitimating state capitalism and drawing us into an ethics of “lesser evilism”. 
Bookchin 90 (Murray, Director Emeritus @ Institute for Social Ecology, “Remaking Society: Pathways to a Green Future”, p. 159-162  GAL)

Ecologically, humanity is faced with major climatic changes, rising ....  it made the party more bureaucratic, manipulative, and &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; — in short, very much like the rivals it once denounced.

C. Our criticism comes first: Humanity’s place in natural evolution is as the self-reflexive voice of nature made conscious- this is an ethical ontology which requires the dissolution of hierarchy.  Failure to embrace our ecological responsibilities results in a fundamentally immoral society which threatens nuclear extinction and ecological destruction.
Bookchin 94 (Murray, Director Emeritus @ the Institute for Social Ecology, “Which Way for the Ecology Movement?”, p. 74 GAL)

Mutualism, self-organization, freedom, and subjectivity, together with ….. promise, hope, and creativity, it deserves a better fate than what seems to confront it in the years ahead.

D. Vote neg: The State is a social construction which can be dismantled by micro-political direct action in which individuals minimize their own contribution to statism.
O’Connor 90 (Max T., “An eliminativist view of the state”, Extropy #5, Winter, http://www.mind-trek.com/articles/t21c.htm  Accessed 9/14/12 GAL)

What kind of thing is &amp;#34;the State&amp;#34; supposed to be?

Rare earth prices are low now – the plan causes price spikes and supply shortages.

Falling Prices¶ While prices of rare earths fell in …. “Strengthening the U.S. position across the supply chain requires a capable workforce,” the report said.

Sudden energy investment skyrockets rare earth prices – devastates manufacturers and deters innovation across all industries – that turns the case

High prices cause ocean mining – collapses marine ecosystems

A. Interpretation: The affirmative should implement a plan in which financial incentives and restrictions should be directly targeted at energy production&#xD;
Energy production includes  - &#xD;
US EIA, no date&#xD;
(Glossary, Energy Information Agency, http://www.eia.gov/tools/glossary/index.cfm, acsd 5-12)&#xD;
&#xD;
Primary energy production: production of primary energy. The Energy AND consumption; biomass waste consumption; and biofuels feedstock.&#xD;
&#xD;
B. Violation: creating a fuel bank doesn&amp;#39;t mean energy production&#xD;
&#xD;
C.  REASONS TO PREFER.&#xD;
1.  Limits. &#xD;
Their interpretation opens aff case choice to changing anything that might discourage energy production.  They could improve the European economy, or stop a war with Iran.  Unlimited case possibilities make negative preparation too difficult.  &#xD;
2.  Ground&#xD;
The aff interpretation allows them to claim too many advantages unrelated to increasing energy production, such as getting to space. Fair ground division on this topic should be centered around increasing or decreasing energy production.  Our interpretation guarantees this.&#xD;
3.  Bright line&#xD;
Their interpretation requires that you look at the intent or effects of regulations rather than on the words.  Our interpretation sets a bright line -- if the words of the law mandate a limit on energy production, then it is topical to remove it.  Avoiding subjective judging decisions is good for the exercise of jurisdiction.  Also, any advantages based on removing restrictions would be extratopical, not reasons to vote aff.&#xD;
&#xD;
4. Topical Versoin of the Aff&#xD;
D.  TOPICALITY AND FX ARE VOTERS.&#xD;
For reasons of education, fairness and jurisdiction.¶ uranium mining¶ for materials for nuclear weapons¶ is a topical aff&#xD;
