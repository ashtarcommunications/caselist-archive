Since the beginning of the 1980s, energy markets have moved toward equilibrium, thus reducing the need for radical Executive and Congressional intervention. Instead, day-to-day regulation takes place away from the more political branches and is accomplished through administrative agencies and the court system. Contemporary federal regulation of the natural gas and electric industries is occurring most noticeably at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), the primary innovator in the developing area of government markets.

The fact that prediction isn’t perfect should NOT mean that we abandon it – rather, imperfections in predictive models should lead us to debate over the best predictions we can make and take action to prevent crisis precisely because the future is uncertain.

Alexander Wendt, 3rd Most Influential Scholar of IR in the World According to Survey of 1084 IR Scholars, 98

As a community, we in the academic study of international politics spend too much

There’s a distinction between uncertainty and risk. In conditions of uncertainty, there’s no way of knowing what outcomes are possible, which is when prediction fails. That’s what they criticize. Our argument is an assessment of risk – we know the possible outcomes and can analyze relative probabilities. This means our argument is more likely to be true. 
Michael Fitzsimmons, Washington, DC-based defense analyst, Winter 2006-2007, Survival, Vol. 48, No. 4, p. 134

Free Online Dictionary(http://www.thefreedictionary.com/solar+power)

They overlimit—OTEC uses solar energy to generate steam and power a turbine—that is the same process that nuclear reactors, coal fired power plants, natural gas, and oil use to generate electricity~-~-
The topic says solar, not photovoltaics—means you prefer our interpretation
Doesn’t underlimit—it only adds OTEC and passive CSP; there is no external chemical or physical process to production of OTEC, which excludes tech like biomass

Eventually, global warming will melt enough of the polar ice to modify the world&amp;#39;s 
AND
age. This may even cause the extinction of humankind. 

Global warming will lead to an ice age 
Dr. J.C. Corunna, 6-27-2008, “Next ice age could be closing in”, Sarnia Observor, lexis 
Intense global warming has increased temperatures in the Gulf Stream and increased heat transfer into 
AND
next ice age. It could begin in five years; maybe less.

State regulation is uniquely volatile

b) Neg ground – they get CPs that compete with the plan text, all the built-in topic CPs, and the net-benefit as a disad.

Agency preemption is the critical battleground for global issues of federalism
Young 2008(Earnest, Professor of Law at Duke Law School, &amp;#34;Executive Preemption&amp;#34;, Northwestern University Law Review, Vol. 102, No. 2, p869)

Preemption of state regulatory authority by national law is the central federalism issue of our

Agency action thus evades both the political and the procedural safeguards of federalism.
Preempting state regulations is critical to environmental protection and the economy
Donze 2000(Patricia, NYU Law, &amp;#34;LEGISLATING COMITY: CAN CONGRESS ENFORCE FEDERALISM CONSTRAINTS THROUGH RESTRICTIONS ON PREEMPTION DOCTRINE?&amp;#34;, http://www.law.nyu.edu/ecm_dlv/groups/public/@nyu_law_website__journals__journal_of_legislation_and_public_policy/documents/documents/ecm_pro_060641.pdf)

Although it is surprising that these federalism bills went as far as they did in

Security is inevitable—rejecting it causes the state to become more interventionist, flipping the impact

The following section will briefly raise some questions about the rejection of the old security 
AND
the political limits of the framework proposed by critical and emancipatory theoretical approaches. 


Shifting away from the security framework causes conflict and causes intervention – only the perm gives political content to rights
McCormack 10
~~Tara McCormack, ~’10, is Lecturer in International Politics at the University of Leicester and has a PhD in International Relations from the University of Westminster. 2010, (Critique, Security and Power: The political limits to emancipatory approaches, page 59-61)~~

Thayer 6 (Bradley, Professor of Security Studies at Missouri State, The National Interest, &amp;#34;In Defense of Primacy,&amp;#34; Nov/Dec, 32-7)
In contrast, a strategy based on retrenchment will not be able to achieve these
