The root causes of ecological problems are found in social hierarchy. Their misidentification of the causes of the ecological crisis means they can never solve.=====&#xD;
**Bookchin 93** (Murray, &amp;#34;What is Social Ecology?&amp;#34;, orig. published in Environmental Philosophy: From Animal Rights to Radical Ecology, ed. Michael Zimmerman, [[http://greenfrombelow.wordpress.com/murray-bookchin-what-is-social-ecology/-http://greenfrombelow.wordpress.com/murray-bookchin-what-is-social-ecology/]])&#xD;
&#xD;
What defines social ecology as social is its recognition of the often-overlooked fact &#xD;
AND&#xD;
, to be sure, from those that are produced by natural catastrophes.&#xD;
If this approach seems a bit too sociological for those environmentalists who identify the primary &#xD;
AND&#xD;
ecological future of the planet will be decided is clearly a social one.&#xD;
Indeed, to separate ecological problems from social problems — or even to play down &#xD;
AND&#xD;
what has given rise to the very idea of dominating the natural world.&#xD;
Unless we realize that the present market society, structured around the brutally competitive imperative &#xD;
AND&#xD;
will be directed toward limited goals whose attainment is more cosmetic than curative.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
=====Our criticism comes first: Humanity~’s place in natural evolution is as the self-reflexive voice of nature made conscious- this is an ethical ontology which requires the dissolution of hierarchy.  Failure to embrace our ecological responsibilities results in a fundamentally immoral society which threatens nuclear extinction and ecological destruction.=====&#xD;
**Bookchin 94** (Murray, Director Emeritus @ the Institute for Social Ecology, &amp;#34;Which Way for the Ecology Movement?&amp;#34;, p. 74 GAL)&#xD;
&#xD;
Mutualism, self-organization, freedom, and subjectivity, together with social ecology~’s &#xD;
AND&#xD;
of a game&amp;#34; that can be changed to suit one~’s personal needs.&#xD;
A society that cuts across the grain of this ethical ontology raises the entire question &#xD;
AND&#xD;
as a condition for freedom, and opposition as a condition for reconciliation.&#xD;
Yet an entirely different ethical, philosophical, and social dispensation can be read from &#xD;
AND&#xD;
support, and sharing without any loss of individual identity and personal spontaneity.&#xD;
Civilization as we know it today is more mute than the nature for which it &#xD;
AND&#xD;
a better fate than what seems to confront it in the years ahead.&#xD;
&#xD;
====Deep ecology makes the poor and oppressed fair game for outright extermination in the name of respect for &amp;#34;natural law&amp;#34;.====&#xD;
**Bookchin 90** (Murray, Director Emeritus @ Institute for Social Ecology, &amp;#34;Remaking Society: Pathways to a Green Future&amp;#34;, p. 11-12  GAL)&#xD;
&#xD;
The temptation to equate human beings who live in complex, highly institutionalized, and bitterly divided societies with ordinary animals, is finding its voice in seemingly sophisticated arguments that often parade under the guise of &amp;#34;radical&amp;#34; ecological philosophies. The resurgence of a new Malthusianism that contends that growth rates in population tend to exceed growth rates in food production is the most sinister ideological development of all.&#xD;
The myth that population increases in places like the Sudan, for example, result &#xD;
AND&#xD;
and agribusiness have anything to do with the &amp;#34;course&amp;#34; of nature.&#xD;
What renders this new &amp;#34;biocentrism,&amp;#34; with its antihumanistic image of human beings as interchangeable with rodents or ants, so insidious is that it now forms the premise of a&#xD;
growing movement called &amp;#34;deep ecology.&amp;#34; 2 &amp;#34;Deep ecology&amp;#34; was spawned among well-to-do people who have been raised on a spiritual diet of Eastern cults mixed with Hollywood and Disneyland fantasies. The American mind is formless enough without burdening it with &amp;#34;biocentric&amp;#34; myths of a Buddhist and Taoist belief in a universal &amp;#34;oneness&amp;#34; so cosmic that human beings with&#xD;
all their distinctiveness dissolve into an all-encompassing form of &amp;#34;biocentric equality.&amp;#34; Reduced to merely one life-form among many, the poor and the impoverished either become fair game for outright extermination if they are socially expendable, or they become objects of brutal exploitation if they can be used to aggrandize the corporate world. Accordingly, terms like &amp;#34;oneness&amp;#34; and a &amp;#34;biocentric democracy&amp;#34; go hand-in-hand with a pious formula for human oppression, misery, and even extermination.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
====Deep ecology blames all people equally for environmental destruction, ignoring the social roots of the crisis.====&#xD;
**Bookchin 90** (Murray, Director Emeritus @ Institute for Social Ecology, &amp;#34;Remaking Society: Pathways to a Green Future&amp;#34;, p. 9-10  GAL)&#xD;
&#xD;
Already deeply disturbed by the fact that a self-professed Green could think so much like his ecological opponents, I decided to ask him a blunt question: &amp;#34;What do you think is the cause of the present ecological crisis?&amp;#34; His answer was very emphatic: &amp;#34;Human beings%21 People are responsible for the ecological crisis%21&amp;#34;&#xD;
&amp;#34;Do you mean that people such as blacks, women, and the oppressed are causing ecological imbalances—not corporations, agribusiness, ruling elites, and the State?&amp;#34; I asked with complete astonishment.&#xD;
&amp;#34;Yes, people%21&amp;#34; he answered even more heatedly. &amp;#34;Everyone%21 They overpopulate the earth, they pollute the planet, they devour its resources, they are greedy. That~’s why corporations exist—to give people the things they want.&amp;#34;&#xD;
I suspect our discussion would have become explosive if my California Green had not been distracted by a nearby game of volley-ball and leaped up to join it.&#xD;
I could not forget this conversation. Indeed, it haunts me to the present day because of the extent, as I have since learned, to which it reflects the thinking of many environmentalists, some of whom would militantly call themselves &amp;#34;radicals.&amp;#34;&#xD;
The most striking feature of such a way of thinking is not only that it &#xD;
AND&#xD;
turned into a destructive force that threatens the survival of the living world.&#xD;
Reduced to a mere species, human beings can now be treated as a simple &#xD;
AND&#xD;
&amp;#34; produced by &amp;#34;overcrowding&amp;#34; or the need for &amp;#34;living space.&amp;#34;&#xD;
In a like manner, we can dismiss or &amp;#34;plain away hunger, misery&#xD;
AND&#xD;
and the like, who are inexorably subject to relentless &amp;#34;natural laws.&amp;#34;&#xD;
If one ~’views the human condition this way, such that all life-forms are &amp;#34;biocentrically&amp;#34; interchangeable despite their unique qualifies, people, too, become interchangeable with locusts or, for that matter, ~’viruses—as has been seriously suggested in a debate by advocates of this viewpoint — and are equally expendable in the interplay of so-called natural laws. 1&#xD;
&#xD;
====D. Vote neg: The State is a social construction which can be dismantled by micro-political direct action in which individuals minimize their own contribution to statism.====&#xD;
**O~’Connor 90** (Max T., &amp;#34;An eliminativist view of the state&amp;#34;, Extropy ~~%235, Winter, [[http://www.mind-trek.com/articles/t21c.htm-http://www.mind-trek.com/articles/t21c.htm]]  Accessed 9/14/12 GAL)&#xD;
&#xD;
What kind of thing is &amp;#34;the State&amp;#34; supposed to be? It is &#xD;
AND&#xD;
ultimate actor or agent, it is not a thing of any kind.&#xD;
&#xD;
Since &amp;#34;the State&amp;#34; is not any kind of thing, we cannot truly &#xD;
AND&#xD;
these activities by voting, paying &amp;#34;taxes&amp;#34; and by verbal support.&#xD;
&#xD;
As Ludwig von Mises noted, &amp;#34;It is the meaning which the acting individuals &#xD;
AND&#xD;
, decisions, and actions of the individual human beings comprising the group.&#xD;
&#xD;
&amp;#34;The State&amp;#34; is really nothing more than statist behavior and belief - and &#xD;
AND&#xD;
or less statist at different times and in very different and incomparable ways.&#xD;
&#xD;
Political office holders, who make laws and oversee and coordinate a wide range of &#xD;
AND&#xD;
verbally supporting, or turning a blind eye to statism is thereby statist.&#xD;
&#xD;
In so far as there is any sense to talk of &amp;#34;the State&amp;#34; &#xD;
AND&#xD;
&amp;#34;government&amp;#34; monopoly or nothing. What are you to do?12&#xD;
&#xD;
5: Bringing About a Better Anarchy &#xD;
We already live in an anarchy. There is no &amp;#34;State.&amp;#34; There are &#xD;
AND&#xD;
needed is a micro-politics, a politics of individual behavior.13&#xD;
&#xD;
We should seek to minimize our own contribution to statism, and to persuade others &#xD;
AND&#xD;
is to increase understanding and increase rationality and responsibility, not to destroy.&#xD;
&#xD;
One of the four central extropian principles14 is that of self-responsibility for one~’s values, choices, and thinking. Living up to this principle is the best way to fight statism and to bring about the universal extropian community proper to intelligent beings. A focus on the individual and the rationality of behavior will not only break down statism, but all other forms of collectivist irrationality such as racism, sexism, and nationalism.&#xD;

Kovel 2(Joel, Professor of Social Studies at Bard , &amp;#34;The Enemy of Nature,&amp;#34; p140-141)&#xD;
The precondition of an ecologically rational attitude toward nature is the recognition that nature far &#xD;
AND&#xD;
profit-expansion. Never has a holocaust been carried out so impersonally. &#xD;
The alternative is to engage in anti-power- the resistance against capitalist forms of domination. &#xD;
&#xD;
We~’ll say that the judge should take the role of an interested citizen and decide which movement to support-capitalism or its resistance. &#xD;
&#xD;
Anti-power may not be readily obvious to the affirmative, but it is there-by engaging in everyday resistance, we can build up forces that will explode during times of crisis.  &#xD;
&#xD;
View the advocacy of the neg as a form of this resistance-our speech act is a crack in the system of capital. &#xD;
