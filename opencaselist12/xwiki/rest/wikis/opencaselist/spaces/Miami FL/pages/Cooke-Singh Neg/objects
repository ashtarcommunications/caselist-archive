**===A. Uniqueness===**

**====Obama is using his political capital to push Immigration reform now. The reform will be a big step in eliminating the US v. Them mentality====**

**Globe and Mail, January 30th  2013** (&amp;#34;Two parties and paperless millions&amp;#34; The Globe and Mail, Editorial pg. A12) 
For the first time in years, there is bipartisan support in the U.
AND
of us used to be them.&amp;#34; This sensible reform is long overdue. 


===B. LINK===


Obama can~’t win on Energy – Kills PC 
Eisler 12 (Matthew is a Researcher @ the Chemical Heritage Foundation. &amp;#34;Science, Silver Buckshot, and ~’All of The Above~’&amp;#34; April 2, http://scienceprogress.org/2012/04/science-silver-buckshot-and-%E2%80%9Call-of-the-above%E2%80%9D/)

Conservatives take President Obama~’s rhetoric at face value. Progressives see the president as disingenuous
AND
will probably mean four more years of inaction and increased resort to cant.


===C. Internal Link===
Without immigration reform, noncitizens will avoid much needed healthcare services.   
Park, 4 – J.D. Candidate, Florida State University College of Law (Seam, Georgetown Immigration Law Journal, &amp;#34;Substantial Barriers in Illegal Immigrant Access to Publicly-Funded Health Care: Reasons and Recommendations for Change,&amp;#34; Spring 2004, 18 Geo. Immigr. L.J. 567)

According to the Center for Immigration Studies, out of the 33.1 million 
AND
health care and other essential social services should be removed, not created.
Illegal aliens require undeterred access to publicly funded medical care for a variety of reasons
AND
compelling reasons why illegal immigrants require undeterred access to publicly funded health care.
The purpose of this Comment is to examine how current federal legislation has left illegal 
AND
federal, state and local governments can act together to accomplish this goal.
Federal legislation, particularly the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 and sections of the Immigration Reform Law, have placed illegal immigrants in a helpless situation. 


====Specifically, giving healthcare access to current noncitizens is key to controlling tuberculosis.====
 Calvo, 2008 (Janet, Professor, City University School of Law. &amp;#34;The  Consequences of Restricted Health Care Access for Immigrants: Lessons  from Medicaid and SCHIP.&amp;#34; 17 Ann. Health L. 175//ZE)

Control of TB necessitates screening. Screening is especially important for at-risk groups
AND
when it is easiest to treat and contagion can be best controlled. n171

===D. Impacts===

====Leaving TB untreated leads to a plague that will devastate the world====
**Johns %26 Varkoutas, 98** (Journal of Contemporary Health Law %26 Policy, &amp;#34;The Tuberculosis Crisis: The Deadly Consequence of Immigration Policies and Welfare Reform,&amp;#34; Fall 1998, 15 J. Contemp. Health L. %26 Pol~’y 101, JMP)

Under the current direction of government policy, once TB becomes a problem large enough 
AND
tomorrow we may just find ourselves faced with the grim scenes of yesteryear.

====The 50 states and all relevant U.S. territories should _______====

====State action gets modelled due to local innovation====

**Lash ~’07** (Jonathan, &amp;#34;Climate Policy in the State Laboratory: How States Influence Federal Regulation and the Implications for U.S. Policy,&amp;#34; World Resources Institute, September, http://www.wri.org/publication/climate-policy-in-the-state-laboratory-http://www.wri.org/publication/climate-policy-in-the-state-laboratory, TGA)

America has a long and inspiring tradition of policy innovation and activism that is incubated 
AND
wellspring from which we build the low-carbon economy of the future.
