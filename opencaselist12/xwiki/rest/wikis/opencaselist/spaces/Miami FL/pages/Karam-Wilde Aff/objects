U.S. fusion research has been gutted by a lack of federal funding

President Obama has touted federal investment in energy technology as a smart and environmentally friendly

bucks for solar panels and windfarms, and nickels and dimes for fusion. 
More funding is key to domestic fusion projects.

For years, US researchers have been steadfast in their support of ITER, the

, the results from ITER will only benefit the rest of the world.&amp;#34;

Targeting energy production and spending beyond ITER spurs quick development

Plan: The USFG should substantially increase funding for domestic fusion reactors.

Advantage 1: Deterrence
NIF cuts are coming – funding saves the project

Another part of the nuclear weapons complex is in deep trouble. For the scientists 
AND
vital to the economy will be hard pressed to survive in this climate.

N.IF key to nuclear deterrence
LLNL 13
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, &amp;#34;Stockpile Stewardship&amp;#34;, 2013 https://lasers.llnl.gov/about/missions/national_security/stockpile_stewardship.php

NIF is an essential component of the U.S. stockpile assessment and certification 
AND
and certify the aging stockpile without actual nuclear tests using supercomputer modeling tools.
Nuclear deterrence prevents great power wars and extinction.

The most important benefit of these features today is that they give the Western order 
AND
change. War-driven change has been abolished as a historical process. 


Advantage 2: Environment
Fusion can produce limitless clean energy and solves environment impacts now, funding is key.

The population-crash scenario is surely the most appalling. Plummeting crop yields would 
AND
longer do so if it lost the extra warming from the North Atlantic.
Electricity sector transition is the key to solve warming

Advantage 3: Economy
Investor confidence is down – growth will decline.

The leaders of America~’s largest companies are turning more cautious about the U.S
AND
key export markets for U.S. companies, have also contributed.


However, safe, cheap, and clean energy from fusion power spurs the economy and prevents decline.

Fusion energy has several very intriguing features. First is it~’s essentially inexhaustible. The 
AND
source and that~’s what kept this research programs so motivated over the years.


And, Economic decline causes nuclear war
