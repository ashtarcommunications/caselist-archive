Incentives are defined as promises made in exchange for performance; ¶ rewarded after the performance occurs (Mahoney, 1979; 1989; Maxwell, 2000: 245-¶ 247). The sequence is as follows: promise – performance – rewards. Rewards are ¶ defined as the consequence of performance. Here the sequence is performance¶ followed by rewards.

Observation 1 Text: 


====The United States Congress should require the executive branch to condition the implementation of a twenty-percent investment tax credit for the deployment of domestic nuclear fuel recycling on all relevant parties entering into a binding process of negotiated rulemaking for no more than a year. ====

Observation 2: Solvency and Net Benefit: 
Lack of Certainty of the plan ensures a &amp;#34;space&amp;#34; of flexibility which ensures polices that create incentives are key to innovation and alternative energy

Technology policies alone cannot adequately respond to global climate change. They must be complemented 
AND
impacts of climate change itself, but also in the outcomes of innovation.

Counterplan solves the affirmative, current attempts to increase energy production are doomed to failure because they don~’t take into account industry and labor opposition—wich will spin the aff as an environmental policy and gut it

====U.S.-Russian war causes extinction – most probable====
**Bostrom ~’2** ~~Nick Bostrom, professor of philosophy - Oxford University, March, 2002, Existential Risks: Analyzing Human Extinction Scenarios and Related Hazards, Journal of Evolution and Technology, p. http://www.nickbostrom.com/existential/risks.html~~
A much greater existential risk emerged with the build-up of nuclear arsenals in 
AND
preludes to the existential risks that we will encounter in the 21st century.

He published more than twenty solar and comet papers. He worked for NASA, 

 Mammals and some of the most sensitive flowering plants (lily), insects,

On May 5, 2012, Japan shut down its Tomari 3 nuclear reactor on 
AND
Russia, and Japan—could meet their electricity needs with wind alone. 

====Shortage of nuclear engineers prevents expansion====
Reuters 10 (12/19/10, &amp;#34;Nuclear industry in midst of skills crisis&amp;#34; Pittsburgh Tribune Review, Lexis) 

There~’s a hole in the nuclear workforce, not just in Finland but across the 
AND
The industry needs to ramp up and it needs to do it quickly.&amp;#34; 


====Bottlenecks prevent industry expansion====
Johnson 11 (Toni, reporter for the Congressional Quarterly, 3/18/11, &amp;#34;Nuclear Power Expansion Challenges&amp;#34; Council on Foreign Relations) http://www.cfr.org/united-states/nuclear-power-expansion-challenges/p16886~~%23p2

Construction Bottlenecks. Another obstacle for getting new nuclear construction under way is the capacity 
AND
pebble-bed modular reactors, which do not require a pressure vessel. 


====Expansion is slow—reactors take 10 years to build====
Madsen et al 09 (Travis Madsen and Tony Dutzik, analysts for Frontier Group, Bernadette Del Chiaro and Rob Sargent Environment America Research %26 Policy Center, November 2009, &amp;#34;GENERATING FAILURE How Building Nuclear Power Plants Would Set America Back in the Race Against Global Warming&amp;#34; Frontier Group, Environment America) http://www.frontiergroup.org/sites/default/files/reports/Generating-Failure—-Environment-America—-Web.pdf

At Best, No New Reactors Could Be Completed Until 2016 No new reactors are

====Nuclear power plants are targets for terrorists====
Caldicott 06 (Helen Caldicott, Founder and President of the Nuclear Policy Research Institute 2006 &amp;#34;Nuclear Power is not the Answer&amp;#34; Print)

In this day and age, nuclear power plants are also obvious targets for terrorists
AND
virtually the same lax levels as prior to the 9/11 attacks.


====NRC standards don~’t even have safeguards against airplanes for new designs====
NYT 7 (New York Times, &amp;#34;U.S. Takes Step to Address Airliner Attacks on Reactors,&amp;#34; April 25, L/n, rday)

New nuclear reactors need not be designed to withstand suicide attacks by big airplanes, 
AND
Electric and one by Westinghouse, for which no such analysis was required. 


====Extinction====
Wasserman 02 (Harvey, senior advisor to the Nuclear Information %26 Resource Service &amp;#34;Nuclear Power and Terrorism,&amp;#34; Earth island Journal Spring 2002 Vol. 17, No.1//)

The intense radioactive heat within today~’s operating reactors is the hottest anywhere on the planet
AND
core of our life and of all future generations must be shut down. 




===DA: Prolif===

Diesendorf 11 (Mark, Australian academic and environmentalist, teaches Environmental Studies at the University of South Wales, &amp;#34;Demystification of Nuclear Energy&amp;#34; D%21ssent No.36, Spring 2011, 13-18) http://www.ies.unsw.edu.au/docs/DemystificationNuclearEnergyMD.pdf

Nuclear power station disasters can be caused by natural phenomena, such as earthquakes and 
AND
countries that have nuclear power, the greater the probability of nuclear war. 




===DA: Accidents===


====Accidents are inevitable with nuclear power====
Ramana 11 (MV, with the Program on Science and Global Security at Princeton University and is on the Coordinating Committee of the Coalition for Nuclear Disarmament and Peace, &amp;#34;No escape from accidents&amp;#34;) http://www.nirs.org/international/reachingcriticalwillreport.pdf 

In the aftermath of Fukushima and, twenty five years earlier, Chernobyl, it 
AND
is a limit to how far they can be reduced through engineering efforts. 


====Meltdowns cause extinction====
