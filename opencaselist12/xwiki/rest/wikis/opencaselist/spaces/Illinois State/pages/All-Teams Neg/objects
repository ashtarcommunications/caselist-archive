A.   The affirmative doesnt specify their agent—they should
B. Vote Negative—all voters
1.Kills CP ground.  Lack of specification destroys our agent CP ground which is core negative ground. Also key to in depth education about the opportunity costs of the congress v. the court v. the executive and agencies.  This is critical civic education and is a key internal link to all their educational claims
2.  Crushes solvency debates—no in-depth solvency debates about the who, what, when, and hows of the plan.  Most important on this topic because energy policy is mess, the DOE, the NRC, EPA, and other agencies all fight for control and credit.
3. Lack of specifying is functional severance—allows them to say not us—allows them to jack our link grd to agency DA’s that is core topic ground and makes the plan a moving target. This jacks education and fairness and makes debate boring—leaves us with statism args.
4. Vote Neg on presumption—90% of solvency in specification of the plan
