 Counter definition: solar power is Energy from the sun~’s radiation converted into heat or electricity. That~’s Sioux Valley Energy Cooperative dictionary.
Sioux Valley Energy no date (&amp;#34;Electrical Dictionary,&amp;#34; http://www.siouxvalleyenergy.com/electricDictionary.php~~%23S-http://www.siouxvalleyenergy.com/electricDictionary.php)
Solar power: Energy from the sun~’s radiation converted into heat or electricity.  (See active solar energy, passive solar energy.)

Defining the topic to include only industrial energy produces thought habits destructive of local self reliance.  The result is the transformation our social reality into the production of intellectual gold for an ecologically and socially unsound worldview.  
Robert – 95 (Genesis and the development of scientific fact: the case of Energy, WISE News Communique in March 1995, Jean Robert, teacher and activist for alternative technologies. Former UN consultant)

Re-reading my own prose makes me realize more acutely than ever   
AND
For, if energy imports unwanted industrial assumptions, they must be traced back to the epoch that shaped the concept. 

Renouncing the negative destabilizes this worldview, frees us from the powerlessness that robs our awareness and predestines our existence

Professor Illich – 94 (PhD at the University of Salzburg, BRAVE NEW BIOCRACY: HEALTH CARE FROM WOMB TO TOMB, New Perspectives Quarterly, Winder94, Vol. 11, Issue 1)
I can imagine no complex of controls capable of saving us from the flood of posions,…
AND
That is why I regard a call to take responsibility for my health as senseless, misleading, indecent, and, in a very particular way, blasphemous. 


Counterinterp: power is conversion to usable form –preserves their distinction and ensure directionality

He has writted many articles and provided tips on solar and alt energy for various websites and blogs. 

Solar energy versus Solar Power.

AND
Again this is solar power supplied as a result of the conversion of solar energy to something useable by man, I this case hot water. 


Passive solar is heart of solar power debate

Or restart the rulemaking process from the beginning by issues a new proposed rule.

Vladeck, Associate Professor of Law at the University of Miami School of Law (Lindsay 11/18, &amp;#34;Does the Court Act as &amp;#34;Political Cover&amp;#34; for the Other Branches?&amp;#34; http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.education.region.usa.edebate/648-http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.education.region.usa.edebate/648)
While the Supreme Court may have historically been able to act as political cover for the President and/or Congress,
AND
For whatever reason, received the attention of the public. 

Bold, unprecedented decisions undermine the courts legitimacy and ensure that the ruling is entirely ignored.

Justice Breyer describes the court in its early years, when it decided few cases and the ones it decided were trivial.
AND
, in doing so, it threatens our democracy.  That message is powerful, ominous, and very useful. 



Judicial Decisions legitimate the existing legal order by eifying our alienated social roles. 

Schegel 1 (Henry Schegel, Professor of Law, State University of New York at Buffalo, 2001, CARDOZO LAW REVIEW, March, pp 1067-8)

From the judge~’s perspective, any legal dispute is a &amp;#34;disequilibriation&amp;#34; or a break down in the system of normal social relations that must be set right. 
AND
The point of this process is that it is a way of continuing the denial of the illegitimacy and disconnectedness of social relations as they are experienced under capitalism by depicting the unalienated group in its imaginary form as part of political theory.
