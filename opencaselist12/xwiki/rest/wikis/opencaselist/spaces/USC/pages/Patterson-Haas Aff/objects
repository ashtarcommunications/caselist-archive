===WALL STREET SPECULATION===


====The financialization of energy turns the power to decide energy decisions over to Wall Street. It disenfranchises the people who would benefit most from critical discussions of an energy-responsible society.====

Hildyard et al 12 Nicholas, The Corner House, Larry Lohmann and Sarah Sexton.12 Energy Security For Whom? For What? February 2012

&amp;#34;Moving to the market,&amp;#34; however, was proposed as a way of ensuring 
AND
start because minimal change is contemplated in financing this &amp;#34;energy security revolution.&amp;#34; 



====PTCs for large, centralized renewables projects make solar developers dependent on Wall Street who consumes up to half the value of these credits.====

Farrell 12 John Farrell is an Institute for Local Self-Reliance (ILSR) senior researcher specializing in energy policy developments that best expand the benefits of local ownership and dispersed generation of renewable energy. Energy Self Reliant States, 4-19 

A regular tax credit reduces the amount of taxes a business or person pays dollar 
AND
project owners wouldn~’t require big tax bills or Wall Street to finance projects.


====Depending on third party Wall Street financing leaks community money and jacks up the cost of renewable energy, making it less competitive with traditional electricity ====

Farrell 10  John, GRIST, How renewable incentives affect project ownership, 12-7

It~’s not just the owner who benefits when projects don~’t require complex partnerships to get 
AND
impact by a multiplier, whereas local ownership would keep most revenues local.


====The financialization of energy is part of a larger attempt by capital to decide life and death. This form of neo-liberalism creates disposable populations and feed~’s a disinterest in politics====

Giroux 8   * Henry A. McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada Social Identities, Vol. 14, No. 5, September 2008, 587-620

Most of these stories place the blame for these crimes on individualized acts of cruelty 
AND
in the hyper-circuits of power that characterize the New Gilded Age.




===FOSSIL CAPITALISM===


====Energy production under fossil capitalism creates redundant populations. For example, coal mining communities become ignored after their profitability is depleted,====

Environmental Sociology: From Analysis to Action http://books.google.com/books?id=ol2b0nmgGwEC%26dq-http://books.google.com/books?id=ol2b0nmgGwEC%26dq

Historically, West Virginia is a state that has been controlled by coal interests. 
AND
this apparent increase in efficiency lie human and ecological costs that are incalculable.


====Coal politics creates cycles of poverty – turning both the environment and humans into sacrifice zones====

Hedges 12    Chris, American Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, and war correspondent specializing in American and Middle Eastern politics and societies. 7-20, http://billmoyers.com/segment/chris-hedges-on-capitalism%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%98sacrifice-zones%E2%80%99/

There are forgotten corners of this country where Americans are trapped in endless cycles of 
AND
the part of people who seek personal enrichment to destroy other human beings…


====Centralized energy is what makes large-scale factories possible  - creating a critical nexus point for the commodification of work====

Hildyard et al 12 Nicholas, The Corner House, Larry Lohmann and Sarah Sexton.12 Energy Security For Whom? For What? February 2012

Uppercase Energy is an &amp;#34;abstraction which became true in practice.&amp;#34;27 In addition
AND
, place or context helped mould the belief in infinite economic growth.37


====Centralization repeats the authoritarian and capitalist energy past====

To provide the variety of goods and services that sustain them, modern societies have 
AND
more immune to the humbling enormity of the issue than is popular discourse. 


====Corporate rule creates a doomsday economy sacrificing public self-governance in the name of corporate profit – the impact is the end of the planet~’s life support systems====

REINSBOROUGH 3, Grassroots Organizer and Popular Educator, 
(Patrick, worked on a range of issues including forest protection, police brutality, peace in Northern Ireland, indigenous rights, organizing director of the Rainforest Action Network, JOURNAL OF AESTHETICS %26 PROTEST, Aug, vol 1, ~~%23 2, http://www.journalofaestheticsandprotest.org/1/de_colonizing/index.html-http://www.journalofaestheticsandprotest.org/1/de_colonizing/index.html)

Cancer Kills the host. Cancer~’s suicidal destiny is a product of its initial perversion
AND
that slowly starves the many while normalizing over-consumption for the few.



====The 1AC represents a new way of framing energy discussions that exposes how energy exclusions under security regimes hide inequality and perpetuate conflicts====

Hildyard et al 12 Nicholas, The Corner House, Larry Lohmann and Sarah Sexton.12 Energy Security For Whom? For What? February 2012

Both the word &amp;#34;energy&amp;#34; and the word &amp;#34;security&amp;#34; have in fact 
AND
about, and organisation for, a democratic, fossil-free future.


====Only by STARTING from the perspective of the survival of the commons will we create truly pragmatic politics. Public debate must seize the understanding of &amp;#34;Energy Security&amp;#34; away from corporate interests.====

Hildyard et al 12 Nicholas, The Corner House, Larry Lohmann and Sarah Sexton.12 Energy Security For Whom? For What? February 2012

In the bewildering, sometimes frightening, talk about &amp;#34;energy security&amp;#34; that bombards 
AND
&amp;#34;energy security&amp;#34; and the most pragmatic starting point for practical action.




===Plan===
Plan: The United States federal government should provide cash grants to nontaxable entities and individuals for distributed generation of solar power in the United States and require that they receive compensation above the avoided cost rate for the power they place on the grid.

===Solvency===

====Distributed generation creates community-based people~’s energy movements, which expand the meaning of democratic participation and revamp institutional structures that have failed to respond to their constituents and be environmentally responsible====

Hess 9 David J. professor of sociology at Vanderbilt University and member of the Vanderbilt Institute for Energy and Environment. Localist Movements in a Global Economy, Sustainability, Justice, and Urban Development in the United States

However, it is also possible that participation in localist politics may open the door 
AND
it encourages businesses not to let economic proﬁtability trump social and environmental goals.
Microgeneration empirically creates a relationship with energy- Instead of just using it, people feel like they are &amp;#34;tending their solar garden.&amp;#34; It creates public engagement with energy and makes people change their practices.

Permutation: do both-Wilderson’s conception of the unavoidable anti-black ontology only applies to certain ways of thinking about modernity, not lived relations- he has no qualification to apply this inevitability to the modern world.  This way of thinking about modernity is due to the separation of different humans from nature: western ideology created people as individuals, which separated people from the environment. This distinction is the origination of racism. Only altering people’s relationship with nature solves.

Who’s to blame, if that’s the right word, if the project ends up 
AND
spending taxpayer money on Chinese firms to build U.S. bridges.
3. Rollback of state policies under the commerce clause will happen-leaves grids open to attack.

The market expansion function of transmission can reduce the profitability of generators possessing market power
AND
expense of in-state residents who would benefit from lower power prices.
7. Turn- utilities

Solar power can become a tool to resist current energy imperialism, four reasons:
A. Institution building – American Indian government solar projects are conduits for capable institutions, practical sovereignty, and cultural integrity. 
B. Reduced environmental impact: Small-scale solar energy projects displace conventional types of electricity generation, substantially decreasing environmental impact.
C. Energy access: solar is the most efficient way to expand access to poor and remote areas on American Indian lands that are currently not served by electricity
D. Selling excess power: small-scale solar developments can supply income for American indians that have access to the grid as they can sell their excess power to traditional utilities

a)Indigenous autonomy- extend Dreveskracht You should reject the affirmative’s attempted to occupy the lowest common denominator in the struggle against racism. Truly transforming power structures requires the mobilization and autonomization of every group racism effects. 
Asserting the inescabability of anti-blackness is a new form of pessimist mastery that that totalizes anti-whiteness movements, ignores their progress, and ends the search for better conditions. The black body is NO LONGER DENIED ONGOLOGICAL STATUS IN THE SAME WAY AS DURING THE SLAVE YEARS. The political ontology of race is not fixed.

Their roll of the ballot is bad- by saying whoever “resists”, it makes it seem as if consequences aren’t relevant and that just intending to resist is sufficient- creates a hollow gesture

Permutation: do both-Wilderson’s conception of the unavoidable anti-black ontology only applies to certain ways of thinking about modernity, not lived relations- he has no qualification to apply this inevitability to the modern world.  This way of thinking about modernity is due to the separation of different humans from nature: western ideology created people as individuals, which separated people from the environment. This distinction is the origination of racism. Only altering people’s relationship with nature solves.
