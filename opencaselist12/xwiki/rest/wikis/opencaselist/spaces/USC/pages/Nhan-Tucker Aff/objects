Nanotech weapons would be extremely powerful and could lead to a dangerously unstable arms race

Overview:  The Center for Responsible Nanotechnology has developed a tentative outline for the international

Technically, the development of MNT depends on a design and on a molecular manipulation

My first experience of police kettling was aged 16. It was May Day 2001
AND
– from Seattle to Prague to Genoa – and the authorities were rattled.
Today, as protesters in nearly a thousand cities across the world follow the example set by the Occupy Wall Street protests, it~’s worth pondering what happened to the anti-globalisation movement. Its activists did not lack passion or determination. But they did lack a coherent alternative to the neo-liberal project. With no clear political direction, the movement was easily swept away by the jingoism and turmoil that followed 9/11, just two months after Genoa.
Don~’t get me wrong: the Occupy movement is a glimmer of sanity amid today~’s 
AND
class, the rich class, that~’s making war, and we~’re winning.&amp;#34;
The Occupy movement has provoked fury from senior US Republicans such as Presidential contender Herman Cain who – predictably – labelled it &amp;#34;anti-American&amp;#34;. They~’re right to be worried: those camping outside banks threaten to refocus attention on the real villains, and to act as a catalyst for wider dissent. But a coherent alternative to the tottering global economic order remains, it seems, as distant as ever. 
Neo-liberalism crashes around, half-dead, with no-one to administer the killer blow.
There~’s always a presumption that a crisis of capitalism is good news for the left
AND
liberal globalisation; and the repeated defeats suffered by the trade union movement.
But, above all, it was the aftermath of the collapse of Communism that
