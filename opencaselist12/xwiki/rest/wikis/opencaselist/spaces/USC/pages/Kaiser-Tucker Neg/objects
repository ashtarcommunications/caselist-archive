Increase is in the resolution. It means to make greater in size, amount or degree

Dictionary.com No Date Given http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/increase?s=ts increase - Show IPA verb, in•creased, in•creas•ing, noun verb (used with object) 
to make greater, as in number, size, strength, or quality; augment; add to: “to increase taxes.”

Restrictions are regulatory prohibitions

Words and Phrases 2004 v37A p410

N.D.Okla. 1939. &amp;#34;Restriction,&amp;#34; as used in the statutes concerning restriction on alienation of lands inherited from deceased Osage allottees, is synonymous with &amp;#34;prohibition.&amp;#34; Act April J8, 1912. §§ 6, 7, 37 Stat. 87, 88.—U.S. v. Mullendore, 30 F.Supp. 13, appeal dismissed 111 F.2d 898.— Indians 15(1).

There needs to be a nexus between the incentive, the energy they incentivize, and the energy they trade off with

B: violation- they only criticize nuclear power but don’t increase energy production

This interpretation is necessary to fair ground for both sides. The resolution is a neutral site of stasis for controversy. The topic selection process might be problematic but the important thing is that neither the AFF team nor the NEG team is able pick the exact question of the resolution. If they are they can define the debate in ways that make it near impossible for us to compete and really easy for them to win. There need to be limits on their ABILITY to control WHAT THE DEBATE IS ABOUT. 
This interpretation is key to useful debates. Argument by definition requires limits—the existence of clash in this round doesn’t mean there’s an appropriate frame of reference.  This proves ground is key—not because we’d have nothing to say, but because setting the agenda makes us negate descriptive facts or moral truisms instead of collectively reason
Rowland 1987 – professor of communication at the University of Kansas (Robert, Philosophy and Rhetoric, 20.3, “On defining argument”, p. 155-6, EBSCO)

The final two characteristics identified by Brockriede~-~-a willingness to risk confrontation and a 
AND
risk the self, there is little chance of rationally resolving a dispute.
Conclusion	
The functional approach to the study of argumentation is valuable because it provides a clear 
AND
believes that he or she is arguing then essentially all communication is argument.
A more useful definitional move is to treat argument as the symbolic form(s
AND
for distinguishing between weak and strong arguments, as the functional definition does.
Some will perhaps object that the functional definition of argument for which I have contended 
AND
Traditionally and contemporaneously &amp;#34;argument&amp;#34; is philosophically and etymologically the appropriate name. 


Dialogic clash is itself a process of becoming—the benefit of our framework is the educational process
Morson 4
Northwestern Professor,  Prof. Morson&amp;#39;s work ranges over a variety of areas: literary theory (especially narrative); the history of ideas, both Russian and European; a variety of literary genres (especially satire, utopia, and the novel); and his favorite writers ~-~- Chekhov, Gogol, and, above all, Dostoevsky and Tolstoy. He is especially interested in the relation of literature to philosophy.

A belief in truly dialogic ideological becoming would lead to schools that were quite different
AND
most important thing. What we must do is keep the conversation going. 


Prefer our evidence because it is more specific to the debate context. Game spaces like debate are distinct from other forms of education and public speaking.  There has to be a balance of ground or else one side claims the moral high ground and creates a de facto monologue
Hanghoj 2008 – PhD, assistant professor, School of Education, University of Aarhus, also affiliated with the Danish Research Centre on Education and Advanced Media Materials, located at the Institute of Literature, Media and Cultural Studies at the University of Southern Denmark (Thorkild, http://static.sdu.dk/mediafiles/Files/Information_til/Studerende_ved_SDU/Din_uddannelse/phd_hum/afhandlinger/2009/ThorkilHanghoej.pdf)

Debate games are often based on pre-designed scenarios that include descriptions of issues 
AND
dialogue as an end in itself” (Wegerif, 2006: 61).

The other side is the desire to influence a larger public. The aff’s desire to preempt and change the debate community is always shaped by the norms of debate. 

You will that all black debaters may become subjects while simultaneously speaking from the subjective position of trying to win a ballot

Your aff will never be receptive to the larger public. We should view outside of the academy as more important than our debate spaces

Welsh 12 Scott Department of Communication Appalachian State University (“Coming to Terms with the Antagonism between Rhetorical Reflection and Political Agency”, Philosophy and Rhetoric, Vol. 45, No. 1, 2012, Jstor) 
Giroux’s concluding words, in which scholars reclaim the promises of a truly global democratic 
AND
outside the academy that there can be immediate, material, political consequences.

Our argument is particularly true to the 1AC - using debate for political purposes tradeoffs with producing tools useful for the public 

Welsh 12 Scott Department of Communication Appalachian State University (“Coming to Terms with the Antagonism between Rhetorical Reflection and Political Agency”, Philosophy and Rhetoric, Vol. 45, No. 1, 2012, Jstor) 
What does it mean to say rhetoric scholarship should be relevant to democratic practice? 
AND
no less of an impediment to the production of democratically consequential rhetoric scholarship.

Alternative – Reject the affirmative because of their use of debate as a reconception of political agency. We should keep competing elements of the antagonism in view to understand the limits of debate as political agency in itself

Welsh 12 Scott Department of Communication Appalachian State University (“Coming to Terms with the Antagonism between Rhetorical Reflection and Political Agency”, Philosophy and Rhetoric, Vol. 45, No. 1, 2012, Jstor) 
In light of Žižek’s account of antagonism, one should not be surprised, however
AND
of what Žižek calls supplemental ideological fantasies or ready explanations for the gap.

Our goal as rhetorical scholars in this debate should be the exploration and production of inventional resources suitable for the larger public, otherwise we get lost in TOO-EASY ASSURANCES that what we are doing here – in the debate space – is necessary and sufficient
Welsh 12 Scott Department of Communication Appalachian State University (“Coming to Terms with the Antagonism between Rhetorical Reflection and Political Agency”, Philosophy and Rhetoric, Vol. 45, No. 1, 2012, Jstor) 
The challenge is to resist synthetically resolving these antagonisms, whether in confirming or disconfirming 
AND
of practical wisdom in democratic publics without absolving scholars of responsibility to them.

The question of institutional support is key to expanding wider base for change and caring for other communities – radical exposures fail

Colin, The New School for Social Research in New York, Center for Energy and Environmental Policy, University of Delaware, Radical Green Populism: Climate Change, Social Change and the Power of Everyday Practices, 11-11, http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/e-colin-ruggero-radical-green-populism-climate-change-social-change-and-the-power-of-everyday-p
Radicals must carefully deliberate the development of alternative social institutions and intellectual resources for subversion 
AND
broadening the cultural-social unity of a wide social base for change.
