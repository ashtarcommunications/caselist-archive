Plan: The United States Federal Government should provide Section 1603 Cash Grants to nontaxable entities and individuals for community and residential solar power.

Blackouts
Advantage 1: The Grid
We solve three scenarios for blackouts:
A – Grid Strain: Environmental regulations are forcing older units to retire and pulling units offline for upgrades putting increasing strain on the grid in the next 5 years.

Our current electricity grid has major reliability problems that will only worsen as demand increases 
AND
. This puts even less stress on the transmission system and decreases prices.

B – Climate Change: Natural disasters and freak weather events from climate change are increasing exponentially- adaptation is key to prevent more frequent and prolonged blackouts from climate events.

Financial Speculation
Advantage 2: Financial Speculation
Current tax credits for renewables bolster the tax equity industry of banks and Wall Street firms who reap all the profit

Farrell 12 John Farrell is an Institute for Local Self-Reliance (ILSR) senior researcher specializing in energy policy developments that best expand the benefits of local ownership and dispersed generation of renewable energy. Energy Self Reliant States, 4-19 

A regular tax credit reduces the amount of taxes a business or person pays dollar 
AND
project owners wouldn’t require big tax bills or Wall Street to finance projects.

Now is the time to pay attention. NEW INVESTORS ARE CREEPING INTO THE THIRD-PARTY SOLAR FINANCING MARKET

Linder and Di Capua 12 ~-~- Stefan Linder, Analyst, Clean Energy Economics, Michel Di Capua, Head of Research, North America, Bloomberg New Energy Finance. US SOLAR – WHITE PAPER, 6-4

US solar financing US solar projects have historically been bankrolled by some combination of energy

some utilities may seek solar portfolios to offset revenue loss from distributed generation.

Financial trading of energy ensures future Enrons -  high prices and bankrupt states

Enron, which was once a natural gas pipeline company, expanded into virtually every

ENRON SHORTAGES empirically have caused higher energy prices and cost billions of dollars

Hildyard et al 12 Nicholas, The Corner House, Larry Lohmann and Sarah Sexton.12 Energy Security For Whom? For What? February 2012

Market manipulation and outright criminality are frequent features of the increased use of financial markets 
AND
dramatically in the wake of the Enron scandal, the practices still continue.

Independently, depending on third party Wall Street financing jacks up the cost of energy

Farrell 10  John, GRIST, How renewable incentives affect project ownership, 12-7

It’s not just the owner who benefits when projects don’t require complex partnerships to get 
AND
impact by a multiplier, whereas local ownership would keep most revenues local.

As companies financialize their debt, they are creating the conditions for another recession – high energy means consumers can’t pay mortgages and can’t pay for food

Peak oil experts predict that volatile but sharply rising energy costs along with supply disruptions

The financial crisis and global recession are likely to produce a wave of economic crises 
AND
obligations. Potential refugee flows from the Caribbean could also impact Homeland security.  


Solvency
The current tax code discriminates against local and public entities that want to produce residential solar- only shifting away from tax credits solves. 
Farrell 12 John Farrell directs the Energy Self-Reliant States and Communities program at the Institute for Local Self-Reliance and he focuses on energy policy developments that best expand the benefits of local ownership and dispersed generation of renewable energy. “Rooftop Revolution Changing Everything with Cost-Effective Local Solar” Institute for Local self-reliance, march http://www.ilsr.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/rooftop-revolution-ilsr.pdf

But keeping solar subsidies unchanged also seems senseless. Solar developers in sunny regions like 
AND
solar for each dollar of solar subsidy given in cash rather than credit.


People will say yes- multiple examples prove there is a growing grassroots movement for DG.
Bronin 10 Sara C. Bronin Associate Professor of Law, University of Connecticut “Curbing Energy Sprawl with Microgrids” December, 2010 Connecticut Law Review 43 Conn. L. Rev. 547 lexis

Lower infrastructure costs, flexible configurations, and the ability to use waste heat result 
AND
to capitalize on this movement by facilitating the proliferation of microgrids is now.

Localist politics is overly simplified by mainstream and radical politics in the squo. Localism creates critical sites of resistance to large corporations and social inequality and injustice.

Hess 9 David J. professor of sociology at Vanderbilt University and member of the Vanderbilt Institute for Energy and Environment. Localist Movements in a Global Economy, Sustainability, Justice, and Urban Development in the United States

The continuities of localism with socialist, communalist, neoliberal, and liberal politics should
