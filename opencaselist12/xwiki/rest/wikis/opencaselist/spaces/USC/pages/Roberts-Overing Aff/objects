Community solar is a term with varying definitions, but for purposes of this Note “community solar” will refer to “the ability of multiple users—often lacking the proper on-site solar resource, fiscal capacity or building ownership rights—to purchase a portion of their electricity from a solar facility located off-site.” 10 Other community solar models are variations on this idea, often influenced by state and local law. 11 Traditionally, solar installations …project described below. 12
