Plan: The United States federal government should exempt customer-generators of solar power from interconnection tariffs and provide cash grants to nontaxable entities and individuals for distributed generation of solar power in the United States

Warming is inevitable and creates devastating natural disasters; the cost of inaction is too high.

Contention 2: Energy Finance
The financialization of energy turns the power to decide energy decisions over to Wall Street. It disenfranchises the people who would benefit most from critical discussions of an energy-responsible society.

Hildyard et al 12 Nicholas, The Corner House, Larry Lohmann and Sarah Sexton.12 Energy Security For Whom? For What? February 2012

“Moving to the market,” however, was proposed as a way of ensuring 
AND
start because minimal change is contemplated in financing this “energy security revolution.” 


PTCs for large, centralized renewables projects make solar developers dependent on Wall Street who consumes up to half the value of these credits.

Farrell 12 John Farrell is an Institute for Local Self-Reliance (ILSR) senior researcher specializing in energy policy developments that best expand the benefits of local ownership and dispersed generation of renewable energy. Energy Self Reliant States, 4-19 

A regular tax credit reduces the amount of taxes a business or person pays dollar 
AND
project owners wouldn’t require big tax bills or Wall Street to finance projects.

Depending on third party Wall Street financing leaks community money and jacks up the cost of renewable energy, making it less competitive with traditional electricity 

Farrell 10  John, GRIST, How renewable incentives affect project ownership, 12-7

It’s not just the owner who benefits when projects don’t require complex partnerships to get 
AND
impact by a multiplier, whereas local ownership would keep most revenues local.

Enron proves – shortage empirically caused higher energy prices and cost billions of dollars
Hildyard et al 12 Nicholas, The Corner House, Larry Lohmann and Sarah Sexton.12 Energy Security For Whom? For What? February 2012
Market manipulation and outright criminality are frequent features of the increased use of financial markets 
AND
dramatically in the wake of the Enron scandal, the practices still continue.

It is clear that most politicians and most citizens do not recognize that returning to

The financialization of energy is part of a larger attempt by capital to decide life and death. This form of neo-liberalism creates disposable populations and feed’s a disinterest in politics

C. Actions for Congress¶ Congress 4should institute minimum federal standards for net metering

Distributed generation fights economic colonialism, returning political power and economic benefits to local communities

The cornerstone of the distributed generation revolution is its potential democratizing influence on the electric

The plan is fast-scaling and will build a political constituency supporting more decentralized renewables 

Farrell 11 (John, “Democratizing the Electricity System: A Vision for the 21st Century Grid” The New Rules Project, June 2011)

Distributed generation offers a cost-effective and fast-scaling alternative to centralized generation 
AND

Providing local power for US energy production will drive growth in manufacturing and other industries
AND
in addition to improving the future of millions of people through clean energy.

Distributed generation creates community-based people’s energy movements, which expand the meaning of democratic participation and revamp institutional structures that have failed to respond to their constituents and be environmentally responsible

Hoffman, PhD, Professor of Political Science at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minnesota, and Angela High-Pippert, PhD, Director of Women&amp;#39;s Studies at the University of St. Thomas, and serves on the ACTC Women&amp;#39;s Studies Coordinating Committee, “Community Energy: A Social Architecture for an Alternative Energy Future”, Bulletin of Science Technology and Society 2005 25: 387)

However, it is also possible that participation in localist politics may open the door 
AND
it encourages businesses not to let economic proﬁtability trump social and environmental goals.


Our anti-capitalist demand on the state uniquely strengthens movements against a flawed energy system and empowers others to demand the same.
