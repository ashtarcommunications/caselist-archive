There exists an intrinsic antagonism in debate – On one side, debate is always shaped by strategy, winning, debate theory. The other side is the desire to influence a larger public. What the Aff fails to recognize is that their desire to change the debate community is always shaped by the norms of debate. Your aff will never be receptive TO the larger public. Let us view the outside of the academy as more important than our debate spaces.&#xD;

Giroux’s concluding words, in which… immediate, material, political consequences.&#xD;
 &#xD;
Our argument is particularly true to the 1AC - using debate for political purposes tradeoffs with producing tools useful for the public.  &#xD;

What does it mean to say rhetoric scholarship… democratically consequential rhetoric scholarship.&#xD;
 &#xD;
Alternative – Reject the affirmative because of their use of debate as a mode/conception of political agency. Our alternative is to come to terms with antagonism by keeping competing elements of the antagonism in view and understanding the limits of debate as political agency in itself.&#xD;
Welsh 12 Scott Department of Communication Appalachian State University (“Coming to Terms with the Antagonism between Rhetorical Reflection and Political Agency”, Philosophy and Rhetoric, Vol. 45, No. 1, 2012, Jstor) &#xD;
In light of Žižek’s account of antagonism, one ….or ready explanations for the gap.&#xD;
 &#xD;
Our goal as rhetorical scholars should be the EXPLORATION and PRODUCTION or inventional resources suitable for the larger non-debate public, otherwise we get lost in TOO-EASY ASSURANCES that what we are doing here – in the debate space – is necessary and sufficient&#xD;
Welsh 12 Scott Department of Communication Appalachian State University (“Coming to Terms with the Antagonism between Rhetorical Reflection and Political Agency”, Philosophy and Rhetoric, Vol. 45, No. 1, 2012, Jstor) &#xD;
The challenge is to resist synthetically… absolving scholars of responsibility to them.&#xD;

Framework. Radical solutions should carefully consider the question of institutions if they care about other communities. The question of institutional support is critical if we care about expanding a wider base for change&#xD;

Radicals must carefully deliberate the … wide social base for change.&#xD;

Only by connecting with the reality of daily lives can communities build a culture away from old energy regimes&#xD;

Thus, contemporary radical communities … issues within the context of daily life.&#xD;

History proves that this retreat has ultimately been counterproductive from making coalitions stronger—in the 70s, individualism culturally becomes more salient, energy were pushed towards things like solar panels on the home—however we became too individualistic about the self in building stronger movements.&#xD;

Agency-based debate produces a fantastic blindness - Reducing politics to a form of political agency draws our attention away from producing rhetoric the public can use&#xD;
Welsh 12 Scott, Department of Communication Appalachian State University. Coming to Terms with the Antagonism between Rhetorical Reflection and Political Agency. Philosophy and Rhetoric, Vol. 45, No. 1, 2012&#xD;

In-round-politics-FIRST is selfish.  The question should be how to mobilize large groups of people and ensure the left survives.  &#xD;
Grossberg, 92 [Lawrence, “Professor of Communications Studies at the University of North Carolina, We Gotta Get Out of This Place: Popular Conservatism and Postmodern Culture, 1992 p. 388-390]&#xD;
If the Left can give up its demand… order to win a victory somewhere else.&#xD;

Individual solutions shift the blame for environmental destruction away from industrial polluters to individual citizens~-~--this creates the ultimate form of neoliberal domination by reifying the power of corporate interests in the name of reshaping our relationship with the environment &#xD;

The affirmative chooses to engage in personalized politics in a competitive debate round by claiming to use their own personal protests to create social change. Multiple impacts –&#xD;
 &#xD;
1.) Alliance splitting – personalizing debate risks splitting alliances and fracturing solutions, causing backlash and resistance&#xD;
Zompetti ‘4 Joseph P. Zompetti (Assistant Professor, School of Communication, Illinois State University) “PERSONALIZING DEBATING: DIVERSITY AND TOLERANCE IN THE DEBATE COMMUNITY” September 2004 Contemporary Argumentation and Debate volume 25&#xD;
The purpose of this essay is to outline… within the debate community.&#xD;
 &#xD;
2.) Structural solutions – shifting community problems to debate rounds turns their movement solely into a means to win and ignores more structural problems&#xD;
Zompetti ‘4 Joseph P. Zompetti (Assistant Professor, School of Communication, Illinois State University) “PERSONALIZING DEBATING: DIVERSITY AND TOLERANCE IN THE DEBATE COMMUNITY” September 2004 Contemporary Argumentation and Debate volume 25&#xD;
The purpose of this essay is to … problems within the debate community.&#xD;
 &#xD;
3.) Debate rounds are bad forums – competition, time constraints, multiple personal advocacies and resource disparities all make these discussions of marginalization impossible – turns the aff&#xD;
Zompetti ‘4 Joseph P. Zompetti (Assistant Professor, School of Communication, Illinois State University) “PERSONALIZING DEBATING: DIVERSITY AND TOLERANCE IN THE DEBATE COMMUNITY” September 2004 Contemporary Argumentation and Debate volume 25&#xD;
The second major problem with this… students of color feel excluded? &#xD;
 &#xD;
Our counter advocacy is to reject the affirmative within the realm of a competitive debate round – we believe the better way to confront transgender politics is to host a public forum wherein we could discuss transphobia with the debate community.&#xD;
 &#xD;
Discussion forums solve better than the affirmative – we should encourage community wide discussions to discuss the advocacy of the affirmative&#xD;
Zompetti ‘4 Joseph P. Zompetti (Assistant Professor, School of Communication, Illinois State University) “PERSONALIZING DEBATING: DIVERSITY AND TOLERANCE IN THE DEBATE COMMUNITY” September 2004 Contemporary Argumentation and Debate volume 25&#xD;
Interjecting the personalized into… in my opinion,enormous.&#xD;
 &#xD;
And it solves better than the aff – attempts to create recognition through competitive debate are structurally flawed – there are no written records of decisions and little collective memory of what happened in any given debate&#xD;
Atchison and Panetta, 09 (Jarrod Atchison, Phd Rhetoric University of Georgia, Assistant Professor and Director of debate at Wake Forest University, and Edward Panetta, Phd Rhetoric Associate Professor University of Pitt and Director of Debate at Georgia, Intercollegiate Debate and Speech Communication, Historical Developments and Issues for the Future, “Intercollegiate Debate and Speech Communication: Issues for the Future,” The Sage Handbook of Rhetorical Studies, Lunsford, Andrea, ed. (Los Angeles: Sage Publications Inc., 2009) p. 317-334)&#xD;
In addition to the structural problems, the … the wins and losses of their own debaters.&#xD;
 &#xD;
And, using the competitive debate format to generate change does not generate the necessary coalitions – it just makes the losing team scapegoats for the community’s problems, which causes a focus on “how to win” rather than “how to make the community better”&#xD;

A.) Interpretation – the affirmative must defend a reduction of restrictions or increase in incentives for energy production&#xD;
 &#xD;
1. Impossible to be neg - the negative has to be prepared to answer everything under the sun; discussing the resolution is the only stable limit on the topic&#xD;
2. Their aff is so in-determinate and unfocused that its not debatable- you say vote for us because other people are resisting transphobic violence. It destroys the ability for the negative to test the aff&#xD;
3. Ground- having a plan text is critical to negative link arguments- the aff only has an advocacy statement- makes it impossible to have an effective and productive debate.&#xD;
 &#xD;
Fairness critical to agonistic respect.  Procedural rules are just an attempt for helping people be active participants in political contest.  We want to be able adversaries.  &#xD;
HATAB 2, Prof of Philosophy @ Old Dominion University,  (Lawrence J., The Journal of Nietzsche Studies 24 (2002) 132-147)&#xD;
Moreover, the structure of an agon conceived… citizens in order to sustain viable political practice.&#xD;
 &#xD;
Deliberative argument requires an agreement established before the debate in order to determine the relevance of any argument. The logic of the affirmative makes every argument relevant and therefore makes deliberative argument impossible.&#xD;
Walton ‘4 Douglas Walton, Full Professor of Philosophy at the University of Winnipeg, 2004 (Relevance in Argumentation) pg. 126&#xD;
Such matters of how a chain of arguments… solving the problem that should be solved. &#xD;
 &#xD;
Deliberative Argument is Critical to Prevent Marginalization and Violence. The Affirmative’s move to abandon deliberative argument because it has the potential to exclude perspectives ignores the Spectrum of Power Relationships that exist throughout society. Their naïve belief that total inclusion in an unfettered public discussion will end discrimination is disproven by the violent history of social hegemony. Deliberative argument is crucial to ending the very violence they isolate.  &#xD;
Tonn ‘5 Mari Boor Tonn, Associate Professor of Communication at the University of Maryland, 2005  (“Taking Conversation, Dialogue, and Therapy Public” Rhetoric and Public Affairs Vol. 8, No. 3)&#xD;

As I have noted, world social categories and knowledge systems have changed so that they now see the colonized as human beings. The shifting in social categories, often by those who are the radicals and liberals of the privileged groups, created deep divisions between reality and its description.

Construction projects on public lands resulting from the U.S. government~’s push to develop renewable energies and pipelines to transport oil threaten Indian burial and cultural places. This scenario raises the fundamental question of whether U.S. laws, as interpreted by the federal land managers and judges, will enable federally sanctioned projects to suppress Indian human rights.

Against this backdrop, infighting can be a matter of life or death for tribal

By fighting one another, we risk losing our Native ways and dignity — our

====Turn – your arguments are a massive form of disrespect towards current indigenous forms of resistance.
