The financialization of energy turns the power to decide energy decisions over to Wall Street. It disenfranchises the people who would benefit most from critical discussions of an energy-responsible society.&#xD;

“Moving to the market,” however, was proposed as a way of ensuring &#xD;
AND&#xD;
start because minimal change is contemplated in financing this “energy security revolution.” &#xD;
PTCs for large, centralized renewables projects make solar developers dependent on Wall Street who consumes up to half the value of these credits.&#xD;

A regular tax credit reduces the amount of taxes a business or person pays dollar &#xD;
AND&#xD;
project owners wouldn’t require big tax bills or Wall Street to finance projects.&#xD;
Depending on third party Wall Street financing leaks community money and jacks up the cost of renewable energy, making it less competitive with traditional electricity &#xD;
Farrell 10  John, GRIST, How renewable incentives affect project ownership, 12-7&#xD;
It’s not just the owner who benefits when projects don’t require complex partnerships to get &#xD;
AND&#xD;
impact by a multiplier, whereas local ownership would keep most revenues local.&#xD;
The financialization of energy is part of a larger attempt by capital to decide life and death. This form of neo-liberalism creates disposable populations and feed’s a disinterest in politics&#xD;

FOSSIL CAPITALISM&#xD;
Energy production under fossil capitalism creates redundant populations. For example, coal mining communities become ignored after their profitability is depleted,&#xD;

Historically, West Virginia is a state that has been controlled by coal interests. &#xD;
AND&#xD;
this apparent increase in efficiency lie human and ecological costs that are incalculable.&#xD;
Coal politics creates cycles of poverty – turning both the environment and humans into sacrifice zones&#xD;

the part of people who seek personal enrichment to destroy other human beings…&#xD;
Centralized energy is what makes large-scale factories possible  - creating a critical nexus point for the commodification of work&#xD;
Hildyard et al 12 Nicholas, The Corner House, Larry Lohmann and Sarah Sexton.12 Energy Security For Whom? For What? February 2012&#xD;
Uppercase Energy is an “abstraction which became true in practice.”27 In addition&#xD;
AND&#xD;

Centralization repeats the authoritarian and capitalist energy past&#xD;

The 1AC represents a new way of framing energy discussions that exposes how energy exclusions under security regimes hide inequality and perpetuate conflicts&#xD;
Hildyard et al 12 Nicholas, The Corner House, Larry Lohmann and Sarah Sexton.12 Energy Security For Whom? For What? February 2012&#xD;
Both the word “energy” and the word “security” have in fact &#xD;
AND&#xD;
about, and organisation for, a democratic, fossil-free future.&#xD;
Only by STARTING from the perspective of the survival of the commons will we create truly pragmatic politics. Public debate must seize the understanding of “Energy Security” away from corporate interests.&#xD;
