Being president of the University of California is like being manager of a cemetery…
discourse designed to make our very moments here together into a set of legible and fruitless demands.
 
Attempts to change the content of the debate space becomes the façade by which the structure of social death within the university becomes sanitized.

Totally managed death. A machine for administering death, …
we are so morbidly aware, we are so practiced at stomaching horror that the horror is thoughtless.

The university lets us play with revolution so that we can never commit to revolution, and contributes more to the values of domination.

without the sun, there would be no daylight,
and without tobacco leaves, we cannot make cigarettes.
The sun is essential for the cigarettes to exist.

If we venture into these plastic wraps we can notice crude oil in it.
We can witness the invasion, occupation, commercialization, and extraction
which is brought upon the plant operators and debt enslaved camp workers
who processed the oil that fueled the truck driver
who brought it to the factory to make plastic.

And there is wheat!
We know that the truck driver can’t survive without their daily bread, 
and therefore the wheat that became the bread is also in this pile of trash.

The fact is that this pile of trash is made up only of ‘non-trash’ elements,
and if we return these non-trash elements to their sources, 
this trash would not exist. 
Without non-trash elements, like
 the sun, wind, coal, crude oil, natural gas, and nuclear power, 
there will be no trash.

As small as this pile of trash may be, 
it contains everything in the universe in it. 
(Inspired by Thich Nhat Hanh, Peace is Every Step (New York: Bantam, 1991) Pg. 91) 

Trash is the background, the flesh and blood, of the resolution. If consumption is the byproduct of energy production, then trash is the final product to roll off the assembly line of our global industrial-military complex. The increase in energy production and technology will only forget the old trash while continuously adding new trash that are hidden in landfills away from perceptual reality. Trash is the invisible repository of our infinite consumption, objectless objects that are ontologically dematerialized by the resolution.
Kennedy 07
An Ontology of Trash, Greg Kennedy State Univ of New York Pr (January 11, 2007) Pg. 52-53
“Technology effaces the body by externalizing its somatic functions and faculties… Trash is the paradoxical phenomenon of this unique ontological mode.”

Energy production maintains institutional hierarchies that are willing to sacrifice moral and material standards to keep the global industrial complex rolling. With no social precedent for public participation, the people who are most affected by the decision making process of energy production are the ones who are discarded and excluded from energy discourse, pushed into political absence. 
Burch 76
WHO  PARTICIPATES: A  SOCIOLOGICAL  INTERPRETATION OF  NATURAL  RESOURCE  DECISIONS WILLIAM  R. BURCH JR.* NATURAL  RESOURCES  JOURNAL 51-54
&amp;#34;Energy systems other than the calories from food and their expenditure... the most effective way for giving power to the people.&amp;#34;

Neglecting the ontological questioning of trash is the precondition to the systemic suffering of others. Denying trash also denies ethical care, and becomes the impetus to exploit and annihilate other beings.
Kennedy 07
An Ontology of Trash, Greg Kennedy State Univ of New York Pr (January 11, 2007) 154-155
&amp;#34;By failing to realize the universal breadth of care... do not let it be as it is in the open truth of worldly disclosure.&amp;#34;

“We’ve got a disposable mind-set: disposable products, disposable species, and disposable people.”
-	Van Jones 
The politics of disposability allows beings to be exterminated for our immediate pleasure or convenience. This permeates all dominant social and discursive phenomena—as long as disposability is unchallenged, then the global-industrial military prison complex will prevail.
Giroux 06
Giroux, Henry A. &amp;#34;Reading Hurricane Katrina: Race, Class, and the Biopolitics of Disposability.&amp;#34;College Literature 33.3 (2006): 171-196. Project MUSE. Web. 31 Aug. 2012. http://muse.jhu.edu/.
&amp;#34;Under the logic of modernization, neoliberalism, and militarization...part of the emergence of a contemporary and savage authoritarianism.&amp;#34;

Trash, and those who are categorized as disposable, are absent from ontological recognition and presence. This creates the paradigmatic conditions for violence against all beings. So before a debate about energy production can be had, we must first:

Affirm trash as the resolution

If trash is the background of the resolution, then to affirm this trash as the resolution will be to recognize our interdependent relationship with trash and those who have been positioned in systemic states of poverty, marginalization, and social death due to the United States’ energy production and consumption. The 1ac performance is both a recognition of how trash reveals both our complicity to the monumental violence that our consumption produces, and it is a repudiation of our attempt to become immortal technological gods at the expense of the rest of the world.
To affirm trash may sound oxymoronic, as how can you affirm something that is ontologically negated?
However, it is the affirmation of this oxymoronic logic, to allow trash to capture our ontological reality, that will empower the connective power of relationality and affectivity between us, material relations, and other beings.

&amp;#34;How then to nurture a micropolitics of the self that is aware... between ethics and morality in relation to waste:&amp;#34;

Without comprehending the ontological and existential failure embodied in trash, any scientific or rational endeavor will only exacerbate ecological destruction and global systemic violence.

The earth shakes: the Mexica ~~Aztec~~ begins his song:
He makes the Eagles and Ocelots dance with him%21
Come to see the Huexotzinca:
On the dais of the Eagle he shouts out,
Loudly cries the Mexica.
The battlefield is the place: where one toasts the divine liquor in war,
where are stained red the divine eagles,
where the tigers howl,
where all kinds of precious stones rain from ornaments,
where wave headdresses rich with fine plumes,
where princes are smashed to bits.
There is nothing like death in war,
nothing like the flowery death
so precious to Him who gives life:
far off I see it: my heart yearns for it%21
And they called it Teotihulcan
because it was the place
where the lords were buried.
Thus they said:
~’When we die,
truly we die not,
because we will live, we will rise,
we will continue living, we will awaken
This will make us happy.~’











Thus the dead one was directed,
when he died:
~’Awaken, already the sky is rosy,
already dawn has come,
already sing the flame-coloured guans,
the fire-coloured swallows,
already the butterflies fly.~’
Thus the old ones said
that who has died has become a god,
they said: ~’He has been made a god there,
meaning ~’He has died.~’
Even jade is shattered,
Even gold is crushed,
Even quetzal plume are torn . . .
One does not live forever on this earth:
We endure only for an instant%21
Will flowers be carried to the Kingdom of Death:
Is it true that we are going, we are going?
Where are we going, ay, where are we going?
Will we be dead there or will we live yet?
Does one exist again?
Perhaps we will live a second time?
Thy heart knows:
Just once do we live%21
Like a quetzal plume, a fragrant flower, 
friendship sparkles:
like heron plumes, it weaves itself into finery.
Our song is a bird calling out like a jingle:
how beautiful you make it sound%21
Here, among flowers that enclose us,
among flowery boughs you are singing.

Aztec cosmology believed that the world moved in cycles: world making, world centering, and world renewal.
In its present context, world making was when white civil society was developing, world centering was when he ascertained its hegemony, and world renewal is the world after the destruction of our current world.
In order to renew the world, sacrifices must be made.
Aztec epistemology argues that in states of emergencies, like droughts, storms, earthquakes, tsunamis, asteroids, or eternal night time, there needs to be a sacrifice made in order to appease the Gods, so as to relieve us of these disasters. When never know if the Gods would actually relieve us from disaster, but it is a leap of faith worth taking.
The Aztecs believed that those who die become Gods, so in this context the Gods are the socially dead. In the status quo civil society the slave and savage are in a state of emergency, and so the sacrifice of white humanity  is needed to appease the Gods.
We never know if the Gods will relieve us of the state of emergency of slavery colonialism and social death, but it is a leap of faith worth taking.
