The First Affirmative Constructive

I didn&amp;#39;t “always know” that I was transsexual
I didn&amp;#39;t diagnose any of my feelings of anxiety as dysphoria
I never consciously associated anything about myself as being trans. 
My inability to access the so-called “standard trans narrative” creates the conditions for estrangement from two communities simultaneously I&amp;#39;m probably just confused. Within the trans community, it means that there are some factions that think that I can&amp;#39;t possibly be a “true transsexual”. 
There are rules to follow, like what it means to be a “real woman”.
If you can&amp;#39;t do these things right for the wrong therapist, then you can bid a sweet goodbye to your transition. 
If they consult these rules then the truth might set you free, but it&amp;#39;s not going to get you past the keepers of the keys. 
The rules used to be much clearer: Come to your appointments in high heels, makeup and a nice dress.
Doctors form the next hurdle.
Because THEY might just decide you aren&amp;#39;t trans enough even if you got that letter for hormones.
It doesn&amp;#39;t matter how badly you need it; your salvation is always predicated upon their temperament and worldview. 

This form of cissupremacy, or the structural privileging of cisgender bodies, is articulated by Stryker in 94 when she articulates that this marginalization characterizes a certain affinity between trans people and Frankenstein’s monster

The transsexual body is an unnatural body… community of Seattle kill her?’

Many would advocate for us to start this affirmation with the political standpoint of the United States federal government, but this is a problem for several reasons.

The idea of reform within the law is an illusion and trap at best
Dean Spade 2011 – Normal Life–Administrative Violence, Critical Trans Politics, and the Limits of Law, Lawyer, civil rights activist, writer, and Assistant Professor of Law at Seattle University School of Law. Accessed via a library with books and all that old-school jazz. Pg.102-104

Perpetrator/Victim Power: Exclusion and … by the state that determine outcomes.

 

Policymaking legislation is an outdated strategy that has been tried multiple times

1) First, My friend, Ambrosia, was taken into the woods by the police, then beaten by the cops, called a tranny and a faggot. I ask myself, would a fucking law that forbade the motherfucking police from being assholes done shit to help her?
2) Second, Cece McDonald walked out of a theater with her friend, and a neo-nazi and his friends call her a motherfucking he-she and a faggot, she got her face fucked up by a glass bottle, she takes out scissors to protect herself and he falls on them. She’s now in fucking prison for manslaughter.
3) Third, When poor trans sex workers working in zones of sacrifice are killed, the killers, for some reason, mysteriously never get caught. The police, for some reason, doesn’t fucking care.

Despite the fact that there are laws that supposedly prevent all of these things, this shit still keeps fucking happening. Why, then, that legislation that says it’s supposed to help us never fucking does anything? Why is it that no matter how many bills we pass, those laws are never actually enforced?

Teams hold this universal idea of fairness and topical education as the cis interpretation of the resolution that is at the expense of affirming our existence. We must ask the question – fairness for fucking who? 

 

Is it fair, that trans bodies have been written out of the epistemological of the scholarship of debate? 
Is it fair, that we have to suffer from dysphoria, with the constant negation of ourselves in this community?
Is it fair, that young trans monsters commit suicide on a daily basis, struggling with transphobia?
Is it fair, that transwomen have to engage in sex work, risking their own health, safety and sanity to survive?

Discrimination law&amp;#39;s reliance on the perpetrator …. trans people for being trans.17 

 
Thus the advocacy: the debate community should confront trans rage

The role of the ballot is to vote for who best consistently performs their political agency that disrupts structures of domination.

This interpretation allows us to have solidarity with other trans people and affirms our lives as a site for resistance to cissupremacy. 

Trans rage is a corrective political program to disrupt how cissupremacy interpolates on to our bodies 
Susan Stryker 1994 – “MY WORDS TO VICTOR FRANKENSTEIN ABOVE THE VILLAGE OF CHAMOUNIX PERFORMING TRANSGENDER RAGE”, GLQ, Vol. 1, pp. 237-254, Gordon and Breach Science Publishers SA, Director at Institute of LGBT studies

A formal disjunction seems particularly … the source of transformative power.“’

Cis traditional debaters tell us to be patient, roleplay policymakers, embrace the topic, add this plan, but it’s easy for cis people to impose their own political strategies on to us. These strategies will always fail, because they’re guided by cis conceptualizations of how violence operates. 

To take matters into our own hands is embracing our rage and using it as transformative power. 

We refuse to necessitate a cis interpretation of the resolution by taking it on face for what it is instead of questioning what it could be. Our relationship with the resolution in the squo is always interpolating meaning and foreclosing upon fluidity and nuanced visions of what the relationship necessitates.

The topic needs reassignment; it needs transition, so that it reflects not just the energy of cis people but also the additive pedagogy that our bodies signify. 

The six natural resources in the resolution can only gain their coherence from what is unnatural. Stryker in 94 explains that those of us that are the monsters and freaks of debate are always in a queer and antagonistic relationship to nature that prevents us from relating to it the same way that cis debaters can.
Susan Stryker 1994 – “MY WORDS TO VICTOR FRANKENSTEIN ABOVE THE VILLAGE OF CHAMOUNIX PERFORMING TRANSGENDER RAGE”, GLQ, Vol. 1, pp. 237-254, Gordon and Breach Science Publishers SA

My own experience as a … which it must nevertheless exist.

We transition the resolution and reassign affect as the condition of possibility for the operationalization of the other 6 natural resources. 
Chaput in 2010 (Catherine, Rhetorical Circulation in Late Capitalism: Neoliberalism and the Overdetermination of Affective Energy.  Philosophy and Rhetoric, Vol. 43, No. 1, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA)

Besides applying centrifugal force to … persuasive capacity of these reaches.

We may not change debate, but our continual performance of our ongoing struggle in how we generate discussion and engagement is a means of challenging the cissupremacy that is alive and well in CEDA/NDT community.

We envision a transpedagogy that is key to challenging oppression within pedagogical spaces like the classroom of debate.

Conclusion: Sparking the Dialectics Audre … questions into our feminist classrooms.

-It&amp;#39;s fucking enraging when people just get to tell me I&amp;#39;m a masculine voice, and no one fucking says anything to the contrary. What makes a man anyways? Is it just snails and puppydog tails, a penis, or something else? When I have to judge whether that lady I&amp;#39;m checking out is gonna think I&amp;#39;m a freak, a dude, or just plain unfuckable. When I&amp;#39;d look down at my arms and feel the compulsion to cut deep and see the red rivers flow. When I tried to touch the world but fucking couldn&amp;#39;t because I wasn&amp;#39;t anything more than a ghost, incapable of touching the 

I am a trans after backstabbers and dreamsnatchers, watch your ass, I f&amp;#39;in to catch you I ain&amp;#39;t talking soft porn I&amp;#39;m fucking you hardcore with my rage and retransition we penetrating your debate coalition. What&amp;#39;s your position? We down for penetration of the mind through a trans pedagogy. Our 1AC is fucking your cognition in missionary position.

Identity politics are inevitable- anti-identitarian politics negate themselves and remove the marginalized from social life.  This process secures normative identities that exacerbates oppression.
