Environmental antiblack racism is poisoning people of color – the environmental policies are influenced by antiblack logic&#xD;
Bullard 02 (Robert D Bullard Ph.D, Poverty, Pollution, and Environmental Racism: Strategies for Building Healthy and Sustainable Communities,Environmental Justice Center, Clark Atlanta University, http://www.ejrc.cau.edu/PovpolEj.html)&#xD;
The United States is the dominant economic and military force in the world today. The American economic engine has generated massive wealth…  racism combines with public policies and industry practices to provide benefits for the countries in the North while shifting costs to countries in the South.

&#xD;
The demand for oil and energy production has put minority communities in constant danger.&#xD;
Bullard 02 (Robert D Bullard Ph.D, Poverty, Pollution, and Environmental Racism: Strategies for Building Healthy and Sustainable Communities,Environmental Justice Center, Clark Atlanta University, http://www.ejrc.cau.edu/PovpolEj.html)&#xD;
Environmental racism also operates in the international arena between nations and between transnational corporations. Increased globalization of the world&amp;#39;s economy … only 20% of the region&amp;#39;s population.&#xD;
&#xD;
Antiblack Racism within civil society has relegated black bodies to the periphery. The Slave is the figure upon which all other subjects take their being.  The ontological death of the slave has given rise to the vestibule of the human. The consumption of the black body through slavery and its surrogate institutions has given rise to the debasement of all other grievances.&#xD;
Jared Sexton 2010 (“‘The Curtain of the Sky’: An Introduction” in Critical Sociology 36; 11. Jared Sexton, Associate Professor of African-American studied and Critical Theory at the UC-Irvine.)&#xD;
To suffer the loss of political sovereignty… rendered as flesh to be accumulated and exchanged.&#xD;

Antiblack logic makes the black body disposable and the site of waste justifying race as the organizing spatial principle for toxic waste sites&#xD;
Mills 2001 (Charles W. Mills, Professor of Philosophy at the University of Illinois, Chicago, 2001, “Faces of Environmental Racism: Confronting Issues of Global Justice (2nd ed.,), p. 84-89)&#xD;
Segregation by law is the clearest … waste products of industrialization should be directed toward them. Like seeks like—throwaways on a throwaway population, dumping on the white body’s dumpsite.&#xD;
&#xD;
However in contrast to demands the coordinates of state and civil society are not elastic enough to welcome or even conceptualize subjective claims made by the slave.  The slave is not present on either the affirmative or negative side: we must abolish this topic altogether and start with the question of the slave and create an epistemic break as the current episteme which influences policymaking as whole is antiblack&#xD;

Out of the multiplicity of relations emerges a new set of metaphors to describe our 
AND
play. We ought,¶ then, play it proudly but humbly.&amp;#34;42

====Our understanding of nature and what is natural is shaped by what is normal and predictable. Psychiatric and psychoanalytic understandings of race, class, colonialism, sex and gender are dominated by the medical impulse to analyze an individual~’s identity, rendering it static. This shapes how all individuals understand bodies, identity and social practice. This equates the abnormal with the pathogenic, thus dictating physical and moral standards for society. The most predominant example of this is the transgendered body, which clinical thought depicts as physically and psychically pathogenic and abnormal in order to reinforce psychiatric intellectual hegemony over all other minorities. ====

====Psychoanalysis and psychiatry are not always bad, but failure to account for the subjectivity of the transgendered identity perpetuates the medical establishment~’s normalizing of cisgendered bodies perpetuates the self-policing of peoples~’ bodies, cancels their agency, and leads to their eradication. ====

Sex reassignment is considered by some health professionals to be the most effective treatment for 
AND
a man~’s body and not merely women who happen to have a penis.
Given the privileging of medical discourse in bodily matters, perhaps it is not surprising

body size and obesity discourses (Evans, 2006; Colls, 2006).
David Valentine questions whether the distinction between gender and sexuality is simply a description of

====The norms caused by this psychiatric and medical understanding of individuals causes corporeal violence in order to reinforce these norms. This is the same process the state uses to reinforce gender, race, ability, and class-based oppression, down to the broadest standards of how we keep time and measure productivity.====

 Foucault suggested that as these norms become internalized, self-regulation would come

====The state can~’t solve – it~’s the biggest perpetrator of violence against trans people. Engaging the legal framework misleads us into thinking we~’re safe. We shouldn~’t advocate for legal equality until these operations are brought out of pseudo-secrecy.====

Since the criminal punishment system itself is a significant source of racialized-gendered violence
AND
not only fail to eradicate transphobia but also strengthen system that perpetuate it.


 

====In order to bring transphobic violence out of pseudo-secrecy, we need to use a discursive approach that focuses on disrupting cissupremacy, or the system in place in our society that shapes all modes of how we understand which gendered-bodies are &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; and which are &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;. This is the root of all transphobic violence and cissexism.====
Kale, NOVEMBER 11, 2011, &amp;#34;Cissupremacy 101: Here~’s one queer transman~’s perspective%21&amp;#34;, http://ok4rj.org/2011/11/cissupremacy-101-here%E2%80%99s-one-queer-transman%E2%80%99s-perspective/, transgender man. Organizer for Norman Queer Alliance and Dolly Parton impersonator, ~~Ofir~~

I~’ve identified as a transgender man since I was sixteen years old. As soon 
AND
my queer readers, is a great place to start in explaining cissupremacy.
First, a definition of &amp;#34;cisgender&amp;#34;: a cisgender person is one whose gender 
AND
cissupremacy—it couldn~’t function if the system of cissupremacy wasn~’t in place.
These things don~’t just affect transgender folks: when I say trans*, I~’m talking 
AND
-conforming, outside the binary, or any non-cisgender identity.
ALRIGHT: so cissexism might refer to an instance where someone makes assumptions about another 
AND
privacy or conversational decency when I became something outside of normal to them.
Sup, cissupremacy?
These are tame, nonviolent examples—I~’d say that cissupremacy is the root of transphobia, and violence against trans* people has been carried out with cissupremacist justifications countless times throughout history.
Obviously, cissupremacy isn~’t just something that cisgender, straight-identified people practice. 
AND
societies that they are often out of sight or are tricky to expose.
These ingrained understandings of &amp;#34;sex&amp;#34;, gender, men, and women, are 
AND
, or any other tactic they want in order to gain that control.
Straight folks and queer folks of all gender identities have to talk about cissupremacy, 
AND
you actively imposed any of those assumptions on your friend/potential friend%21
This is part of allyship: being a good ally doesn~’t mean we never make mistakes, but it does mean that we hold ourselves accountable for those mistakes. I~’m not writing this to make you feel like a jerk (probably not, anyway). I~’m writing this because I have to constantly work on holding myself accountable and resisting cissupremacist ideals, and so does everyone else.
Hope I didn~’t lose you in there%21 In brief summary: if it ain~’t your body, you don~’t have a say in the identity attached to it—don~’t forget it and don~’t let others forget it either%21


 

====Only oral histories allow the the transgendered individuals to define their own experience. Medical and psychiatric understandings attempt to stabilize transgender identity, distorting their history and allowing for it to be ignored. ====

Oral History
Studying the oral histories and positionalities of transgender subjects is cruscial in this project. 
AND
ideology which masks the social production of ideas&amp;#34; (ibid.: 16).
Because memory inevitably has limits, the self we construct is necessarily partial; memory ties together events, persons, and feelings actually linked in only such accounts and not in life as it was lived; it equally necessarily relies on fictive devices in producing any and every account of the self it is concerned with.&amp;#34; (ibid.: 62)
Auto/biography is to give account to complex and parallel historiographies. Feminist auto
AND
culture. Cultural documents shape norms, they do not merely reflect them.
Oral sources in its variety of forms – including aural recordings, (auto)
AND
meanings and it is this act of memory-making that is important.
Luisa Passerini argues that the notion of history as a catalogue of facts is a positivist practise. In this way, the historian seeks to discover facts that will reconstruct the past as it was, to make knowledge-claims on the history instead of a history. For Passerini,
the raw material of oral history consists not just in factual statements, but is pre-eminently an expression and representation of culture that includes memory, ideology and subconscious desires and this may not coincide with hegemonic accounts of ~’what really happened~’ (ibid.: 54).
Oral historian Joan Sangster (1998) is concerned with the ethical issues of oral 
AND
my own (cis?)gender and academic privilege to gaze upon it.


====Affirm this aff as an oral history to disrupt cissupremacy.====

====Just like the gender-fluid subject is always in a state of transition, technology puts us in a culture that is never static, and always transitioning, meaning any significant change has to be a meta-transition, or a transition from one form of transition to another. We can~’t steer our cultural ship because we haven~’t adopted the trans-epistemology, or one that constantly questions scientific objectivity and actively utilizes the imagination. We need an endorsement of culture that is itself always fluid, and acknowledges that society is never static. ====

For centuries humankind has travelled along a course of history without apparent need for questioning 
AND
between individuals become possible? The social and cultural implications are beyond imagination.
We are entering an era of discoveries and inventions which not only change a part 
AND
philosophies are inadequate for our new task. We must develop new ones.
In the past, the members of a culture did not need to generate cultural 
AND
types of transitions. This can be called a &amp;#34;meta-transition.&amp;#34;
the new education
In the past, education could aim at transmission of relatively stationary goals and of 
AND
, science and philosophy. This is education as trans-epistemological process.
The type of education we need for trans-epistemological process is different in goal, methods, form and contents from current education. The goal may be proposed as development of the individual~’s ability to grow out of the traditional logic and explore, discover, invent and reality-test new logics. The methods may include:
1. exposure to various existing epistemologies such as non-Aristotelian logics, the nonhierarchical epistemology of Navajos and Eskimos, the Chinese logic of complementarity, Einstein~’s cosmology, quantum vs. wave theory of light, principle of mutual causality in cybernetics, measurement vs. topology;
2. minimizing psychological dependency upon a single epistemology in order to offset psychological defensiveness toward other epistemolgies;
3. development of the habit of questioning established theories and definitions;
4. open-minded examination of what is exc1uded from the present science;
5. use of the imagination;
6. encouragement of disciplined experiments, data collection and field experience;
7. exercise in inventing new cultural patterns and in elaborating on the details of implementation for such patterns.
Some alarms and excursions
Many students ask whether they would not get confused by learning to think in more 
AND
theory, one truth, etc. This is called &amp;#34;monopolarization.&amp;#34; 5
On the other hand, persons brought up in an extended family or in communal living seem to be relatively free from monopolarization. Monopolarized persons tend to be trapped in one way of thinking, believing that theirs is the &amp;#34;universal&amp;#34; way of thinking. In this respect, Americans are handicapped in preparing themselves for trans-epistemological processes and special methods may have to be developed to facilitate their de-monopolarization.
Release from the trap of old modes of thought has its dangers, however,
