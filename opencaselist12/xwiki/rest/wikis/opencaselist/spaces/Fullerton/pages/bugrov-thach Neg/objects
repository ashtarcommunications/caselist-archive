The Slave is the figure upon which all other subjects take their being.  The ontological death of the slave has given rise to the vestibule of the human. The consumption of the black body through slavery and its surrogate institutions has given rise to the debasement of all other grievances.
Jared Sexton 2010 (“‘The Curtain of the Sky’: An Introduction” in Critical Sociology 36; 11. Jared Sexton, Associate Professor of African-American studied and Critical Theory at the UC-Irvine.)
To suffer the loss of political sovereignty… rendered as flesh to be accumulated and exchanged.

Antiblack logic makes the black body disposable and the site of waste justifying race as the organizing spatial principle for toxic waste sites
Mills 2001 (Charles W. Mills, Professor of Philosophy at the University of Illinois, Chicago, 2001, “Faces of Environmental Racism: Confronting Issues of Global Justice (2nd ed.,), p. 84-89)
Segregation by law is the clearest … waste products of industrialization should be directed toward them. Like seeks like—throwaways on a throwaway population, dumping on the white body’s dumpsite.

However in contrast to demands the coordinates of state and civil society are not elastic enough to welcome or even conceptualize subjective claims made by the slave.  The slave is not present on either the affirmative or negative side: we must abolish this topic altogether and start with the question of the slave and create an epistemic break as the current episteme which influences policymaking as whole is antiblack

Advocacy: Affirm the end of the world

Because of the incoherence between the black positionality and the world itself at large our advocacy functions as a way to reorient ourselves towards the end of the world.
