We begin by noting that the Navy is investigating alternative fuels for 2 reasons: long term cost and security, but conservatives in Congress are resisting biofuels.
Reuters, July 19, 2012 (Defense officials defend “Great Green Fleet” cost, http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/07/19/us-usa-navy-greenfleet-idUSBRE86I0B220120719) 
Thus, we stand resolved: The United States Federal Government should substantially reduce restrictions on and substantially increase financial incentives for domestic production of nuclear power in the United States by requiring all US Navy ships to run on nuclear power.  
Observation 2 is Solvency:
The military is the critical internal link to the development of civilian and military nuclear power—the Navy’s use proves it is safe and reliable and the military will develop new technology which will continue to improve nuclear power and will be adopted by civilians and other militaries.  This is empirically proven.
Baracca, 2007 (Angelo, The Globalization of Knowledge in History, “The Global Diffusion of Nuclear Technology”, http://www.edition-open-access.de/studies/1/chapter_30.html)
Advantage 1 is Oil Dependence:
An alternative fuel powered navy would be more cost effective which would make them more flexible and reduce reliance on oil.
Congressional Budget Office, 2011  (“The Cost Effectiveness of Nuclear Power for Navy Surface Ships”, May 2011, http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/ftpdocs/121xx/doc12169/05-12-nuclearpropulsion.pdf)
Flexibility is key to forward power projection which is key to our hegemony.
National Defense Magazine, 2012 (Eric Beidel, March, “Navy Leaders Want a More Flexible Fleet”, http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/archive/2012/March/Pages/NavyLeadersWantaMoreFlexibleFleet.aspx) 
Loss of US Hegemony leads to a world of chaos, culminating in nuclear war.
Ferguson, 2004 (Niall, Foreign Policy Analyst, &amp;#34;A World Without Power,&amp;#34; Washington, Jul/August 2004
Iss. 143, pg. 32)
Oil dependence causes war and funds terrorism, but reducing dependence solves.
Energy Future Coalition, 2007 (http://www.energyfuturecoalition.org/biofuels/benefits_oil_dep_nat_security.htm) 
Advantage 2 is Global Warming: 
Widespread adoption of nuclear power will solve global warming.
World Nuclear Association, 2007 (“Nuclear Energy: Meeting the Climate Change Challenge”)
Unchecked warming causes extinction – positive feedbacks leads to disease, heat waves, drought, starvation, and the death of billions
Associated Press 2007 (Climate Report Maps Out ‘Highway to Extinction’) April 1, http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17889856/)
Observation 3 is the Economy:
Nuclear power increases US based jobs.
Whitman 2011  (Christine Todd, Former EPA Administrator, Former Governor of NJ, October 13, “Energizing Our Economy With Nuclear Power”, Virginia Business, http://www.virginiabusiness.com/index.php/opinion/article/energizing-our-economy-with-nuclear-power/314622/) 
Increased jobs are key to economic recovery.
Hall, September 11, 2012  (Keith, Senior Research Fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, and former commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, “The Serious Cost of a Slow Economic Recovery”, US News and World Report, http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/economic-intelligence/2012/09/11/the-serious-cost-of-a-slow-economic-recovery) 
Economic Decline causes global nuclear war.  
Cohen, 2008 (Topical Depression: Bernanke Knows What We Have To Fear, The Washington Post, Tuesday September 30, http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/29/AR2008092902660.html?nav=slate)
