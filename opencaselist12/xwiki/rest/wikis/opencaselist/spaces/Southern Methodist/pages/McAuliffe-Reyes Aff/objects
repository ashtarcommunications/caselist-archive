Current incentives for wind power are insufficient and wind power is not eligible for financial incentives like master limited partnerships.  Congressional action is needed to allow wind power access to these financial incentives.

Mormann and Reicher, 2012 (June 1, Felix and Dan, Fellow and Executive Director at Stanford’s Steyer-Taylor Center for Energy Policy and Finance, http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/02/opinion/how-to-make-renewable-energy-competitive.html?pagewanted=all)

Tax credits for wind power are expiring and investment into wind is declining;  MLPs would raise $6 billion in capital for wind power without extending existing grants and incentives.

CleanTechnica, June 8, 2012 (http://cleantechnica.com/2012/06/08/leveling-the-energy-playing-field-senate-bill-to-allow-renewable-energy-mlps/)

The Plan:

Through all necessary and normal means, the United States Congress will expand section 7704 of the Internal Revenue Code to include wind power as a qualified energy source identified in Section 613 of the tax code.  

Advantage One:  Global Warming 

The Earth’s climate is currently warming.

Achenbach 2012 (Joel Achenbach, writer and lecturer at Princeton and Georgetown, July 7, 2012, “Climate Change: Global Warming is a Fact,” Washington Post, http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/achenblog/post/climate-change-global-warming-is-a-fact/2012/07/09/gJQAAGs6XW_blog.html)

Scientific consensus concludes that warming is being caused by our continued reliance on CO2.

Failure to make changes in our use of CO2 will result in the extinction of all life on Earth.

Now is the critical time to reduce our reliance on forms of energy based on CO2

Wind power has the potential to stop climate change

Advantage One:  Jobs

Despite some improvement, economic recovery is failing.

Hall, senior research fellow at Mercatus Center at George Mason University, 2012 (Keith, July 10, http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/economic-intelligence/2012/07/10/why-the-economic-recovery-isnt-strong-enough)

Without increasing job growth, we are headed to a double-dip recession

Wind power is critical to economic recovery and job creation

Making wind power eligible for Master Limited Partnerships would drastically increase investment.

Extending MLP’s to solar and wind power is essential to mobilizing capital.

Wind power alone has the potential to solve our nations unemployment problems.
