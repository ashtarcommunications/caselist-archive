And this apocalypse management seeks to gain permanent unchanging control over world events in order to create security but every attempt at total control highlights new weaknesses that in turn reify the need for apocalypse management making all of the 1AC impacts inevitable

The New Look intensified images… power and influence

In order to secure ourselves we empower the state to seek stability but the only thing the state succeeds at creating is insecurity. This perpetual stability seeking by the national insecurity state justifies unending violence to secure us from instability
Chernus 2008  ( Ira, professor of religious studies University of Colorado, “Apocalypse Management: Eisenhower and the Discourse of National Insecurity”, Stanford University Press, p. 238-9)

Ultimately, though, apocalypse management… ever more insecure,&amp;#39;

Aiming at perfect control, Eisenhower&amp;#39;s… and insecurity.
The only alternative is for us as individuals to critique the discourse of the national insecurity state and its apocalypse management and reject the discursive frames that give rise to our fundamental insecurity

The reduction of being to disposable reserve threatens the survival of humanity – as beings are deemed disposable it becomes acceptable to eliminate their populations.  Eventually everyone and everything will become standing reserve.

Thus, for example, recalling AND the ecos, the earth, and sky. The greatest danger of AND think, becomes himself disposable reserve. 

 
The only way to respond to the dangers of enframing is to reject the affirmative rethink our relationship with nature and the metaphysical assumptions at their foundation.  This is the first step in gaining the knowledge necessary to reorient these relationships. The alternative seeks an ethical relationship with the world around us.

Financial incentives are 3 things
ACEEE, No Date,
 “Financial Incentives for Energy Efficiency,” American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, http://www.aceee.org/topics/financial-incentives-energy-efficiency

Financial incentives can take many forms: rebates, grants or loans for energy-efficiency improvements, direct income tax deductions for individuals and businesses, and exemptions or reduced sales tax on eligible products. Incentives offered by the federal government are generally in the form of tax incentives, which target consumers purchasing home appliances, equipment, or home shell items such as windows or insulation. Tax incentives also target equipment manufacturers and businesses that sell efficient equipment. 


Resolution says restrictions, plural.  Plan has to reduce more than one financial incentive.

Violations: Plan removes a single restriction which is not a substantial reduction


That is a voter
Predictability: Their interpretation justifies tiny affs that only deal with single incentive.  This coupled with the word “for” terminally screws the negative. They already don’t have to result in actual energy increases, now they can be a single incentive.  This explodes the research burden makes it impossible to be negative. And this topic is already too big. 

Grammatical precision, the resolution is plural so the aff should be plural. Grammar is key to education we should learn about the interplay of several restrictions/incentives.  

Ground: single incentive makes it impossible to garner a substantive link. The aff would never be big enough to link to generic arguments. Generic are key ground early in the year.

Interp: The aff has to be inherent.

___. The aff is based on one move by the Obama administration to blocking Chinese ownership of a wind farm, that decision didn’t cite economic concerns but national security.

Xinhua 9/30/12 The alarm bell of US protectionism rings loud - China.org.cn http://www.china.org.cn/business/2012-09/30/content_26681566.htm

A recent decision by U.S. President Barack Obama to block a Chinese-led corporation from owning American wind farms exposes the weakness of the U.S. claim that it is the most open market in the world.
Obama on Friday issued a rare presidential order to bar the Ralls Corp., a company owned by Chinese nationals, from purchasing four wind farm projects, fearing that Ralls &amp;#34;might take action that threatens to impair national security.&amp;#34;
Obama&amp;#39;s decision was based on a report by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) that claimed that the purchased wind farm sites are all within or near restricted airspace at an naval training base.

___.  That’s the violation, the plan is, in fact, the status quo. The CFIUS is already restricted to only deciding for reasons of national security.

Vigdor, Elwood, Marwell 10/22/12 Billy Vigdor and John Elwood are partners, and Jeremy Marwell is an associate at Vinson %26 Elkins’ Washington, D.C., office. &amp;#34;Blocking Ore. Wind Farms: Overstepping Authority?&amp;#34; http://www.velaw.com/uploadedFiles/VEsite/Resources/BlockingOreWindFarmsOversteppingAuthority.pdf

 Since the 1970s, Congress has authorized the president “to suspend or prohibit any covered transaction that threatens to impair the national security of the United States.” National security reviews of foreign acquisitions of U.S. businesses are conducted through CFIUS, an interagency committee with jurisdiction to review “covered transactions,” a term defined to include transactions “by or with any foreign person which could result in foreign control of any person engaged in interstate commerce in the United States.” Under the CFIUS authorizing statute, the parties to a transaction may, but are not required to, submit a joint written notice to the committee. If CFIUS determines that a notice involves a “covered transaction,” it must determine “the effects of the transaction on the national security of the United States.” 
If CFIUS identifies a national security concern, the parties will often agree to take measures to resolve the concern, including entering into formal, contractual “mitigation agreements” with the government. If CFIUS and the parties are unable to negotiate mitigation measures or otherwise address the concern, the committee has statutory authority to refer the matter to the president. The authorizing statute requires the president to make certain findings and to announce his decision about whether to take action in 15 days. The statute further authorizes the president to “take such action for such time as he considers appropriate to suspend or prohibit any covered transaction that threatens to impair the national security of the United States” and provides that the president’s findings and actions “shall not be subject to judicial review.”
 
___. Voter:

a.	The squo is key negative ground. They moot disads.

b.	There’s no lit, no one write that we should do something we already do.

c.	They can’t solve. The Rolls transaction proves that if the president can only use national security as a justification, he will just make shit up.
