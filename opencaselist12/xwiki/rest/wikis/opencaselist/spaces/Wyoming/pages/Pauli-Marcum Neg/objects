AND
the political economy of the modern state is nothing less than a betrayal.
The alternative is to deconstruct the mythologies of current Native-state power relations. Thus we offer the counter history of imagining the US as having never existed

2NC K Turns Case
The only way to solve for indigenous rights is to reject the concepts of sovereignty offered to us as a state tool to contain indigenous peoples. That is the second Alfred piece of evidence from the 1nc.

The root cause of the colonialist mindset is the integration of Native politics into the framework of the state- attempts at decolonization fail without disengaging state power
Alfred 99 Taiaiake Alfred, professor at the University of Victoria, Peace, Power, Righteousness: An Indigenous Manifesto, Oxford University Press, 1999.
The colonial mentality is recognizable in the gradual assumption of the values, goals, 
AND
between themselves and the state. This is symptomatic of the colonial mentality.
True indigenous politics are ANTITHENTICAL to the concept of sovereignty.  In traditional indigenous politics, Individual autonomy and collective decision-making are the basis for all political action.  Authority is earned through persuasion and consensus, not presumed based on a position held.  The Aff’s model of Sovereignty presumes a top down, authority based model of decision-making that makes traditional indigenousness politics impossible and mentally colonizes attempts at autonomy
Alfred, 1999 Taiaike, A leading Kanien’kehaka scholar versed in both indigenous and western traditions, PhD at Cornell, direct of the Canadian Indigenous Governance Program, “Peace, Power, Righteousness:  an indigenous Manifesto, p. 24-28     

Returning to indigenous traditions of leadership will require an intensive effort to understand indigenous political 
AND
in its grip and keeps them from working to overturn the colonial system.





2NC AT: Framework

The impact of this sort of language is MOST important and a PREREQUISITE to Indian culture, autonomy, and self-determination existing—concepts like sovereignty are western poison that upholds mental colonization and continues genocide by another name.  This evidence is comparative—even if they help Indians superficially, mental colonization is a prerequisite.
Alfred, 1999 Taiaike, A leading Kanien’kehaka scholar versed in both indigenous and western traditions, PhD at Cornell, direct of the Canadian Indigenous Governance Program, “Peace, Power, Righteousness:  an indigenous Manifesto, p. XI-XIV     

If we are to emerge from this crisis with our nations intact, we must 
AND
what indigenous nations were before those wrongs began. Indigenous people cannot forget.


We don’t call for roleplaying or posit ourselves as the state. The 1AC is a productive and effective means of analysis that is necessary for change 
Shulock 99 Nancy, PROFESSOR OF PUBLIC POLICY ~-~-- professor of Public Policy and Administration and director of the Institute for Higher Education Leadership and Policy (IHELP) at Sacramento State University, The Paradox of Policy Analysis: If It Is Not Used, Why Do We Produce So Much of It?, Journal of Policy Analysis and Management, Vol. 18, No. 2, 226–244 (1999)

In my view, none of these radical changes is necessary. As interesting as 
AND
, can reshape the policy landscape. Policy analysis can supply the ideas.

2NC Links
Link-
By using renewables as a means for tribes to attain self-determination, the affirmative uses Western epistemology to frame the indigenous as being naturally connected to the environment- this replicates dehumanization and is inherently colonialist 
Shepard Krech III, PhD and Professor of Anthropology and Environmental Studies at Brown University, 1999, “The Ecological Indian: Myth and History”, W. W. Norton and Company, New York: London, acc. 2/15/13, p. 15-27

Even though an invention of Madison Avenue, the Crying Indian is an effective image 
AND
fathom or confront the evidence for relationships between Indians and the environment.50


2NC AT:  Perm
The Perm still links to the kritik. An inclusion of plan necessitates the mythologized approach of “sovereignty” Native-state power relations that creates the impacts in the first place.
The permutation fails—it’s impossible to create change from within the tropes and culture of western politics.
Alfred 99 Taiaike, A leading Kanien’kehaka scholar versed in both indigenous and western traditions, PhD at Cornell, direct of the Canadian Indigenous Governance Program, “Peace, Power, Righteousness:  an indigenous Manifesto, p. 32-33

So why do people do it? Jack Forbes has described a spectrum of identities
AND
individual conduct and values are crucial in determining who the real leaders are. 

And, they don’t get a permutation. This is a question of competing methodologies. The permutation would be impossible because it means taking the sovereignty methodology of the 1ac and pairing it to the deconstruction of this methodology. This skews out of 1ac representations. Defending those methodologies is key to negative ground. The aff shouldn’t be allowed to skew out of competing methodologies by arbitrarily claiming they can work together. This ground is key to fairness and a voter.
And the alternative is contextually different: undermining discourse of sovereignty more effective than indigenous re-appropriation
Alfred 99 Taiaike, A leading Kanien’kehaka scholar versed in both indigenous and western traditions, PhD at Cornell, direct of the Canadian Indigenous Governance Program, “Peace, Power, Righteousness:  an indigenous Manifesto, p. 58

To argue on behalf of indigenous nationhood within the dominant Western paradigm is self-
AND
by carving out a small and dependent space for indigenous peoples within it.
