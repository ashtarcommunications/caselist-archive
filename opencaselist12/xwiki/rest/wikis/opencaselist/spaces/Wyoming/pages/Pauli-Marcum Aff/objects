Energy issues are too complex for linear models- it’s not sufficient to homogenize issues of energy as problems needing quick tech fixes- this causes terrible prediction models and empirically leads to worse impacts.

It is important to emphasize that the transition from the dominant energy model to a

Thus the plan, 
The United States federal government should establish a producer payment for locally-owned wind power produced for on-site demand in the United States.  This payment should be higher than the current Production Tax Credit rate for wind power.
The current production tax credit creates a feedback loop of corporate domination as passive income and third-party restrictions allow massive investment banks to bleed communities dry, add-on costs and extract revenue from the tax-payers.  The plan is key to break this cycle and enable local, direct ownership of wind production

Local ownership strengthens local and regional economies, yet an increasing proportion of the nation’s

Breaking corporate hegemony over electricity and political life requires the use of market mechanisms to turn the logic of the market against itself.  Electricity is a unique site for resistance because it has the potential to shift control of production from corporate domination towards local and direct democracy.  But ONLY institutional action can hold the door open.  Otherwise, corporate hegemony continues unchecked and will crush local and grassroots efforts

The restructuring of electricity markets during the 1990s can be viewed as consistent with the

consideration of the ideological dimensions of such topics would require a separate analysis.
Plan is the only sufficient mechanism to overcome the complexities in complex issues like energy production- fostering increased local deliberation and decision making decenters the status quo discussion of energy that allows the public to resist domination of corporations.

Alternative energy production from federal lands lags behind conventional energy production, though the amount is still significant. For example, federal geothermal resources produce about 7.5 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity per year, 47 percent of all electricity generated from U.S. geothermal energy. There are 2,960 wind turbines on public lands in California alone, producing electricity for about 300,000 people. Federal hydropower facilities produce about 17 percent of all hydropower produced in the United States.
Most U.S. geothermal resources are in the western states, where most public lands are located. The sunny southwest has the greatest potential for solar energy production. Wind resources are more widespread, and there are federal lands in many of the most favorable areas.
The Secretaries of the Interior, Energy, and Agriculture are in the process of identifying renewable energy siting opportunities and reevaluating access restrictions on federal lands. Development limitations, including environmental considerations, must also be assessed. Federal agencies will also consider development incentives such as reduced site rental fees to encourage industry to more aggressively pursue renewable energy production.
Because of the growing U.S. thirst for energy and increasing public unease

mitigation measures may be imposed, or mineral production may be banned altogether.

To meet these goals, however, tribal resource development must also promote self-

Mirroring this desire, many tribes are also becoming interested in energy development opportunities:¶

Alternative energy production from federal lands lags behind conventional energy production, though the amount is still significant. For example, federal geothermal resources produce about 7.5 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity per year, 47 percent of all electricity generated from U.S. geothermal energy. There are 2,960 wind turbines on public lands in California alone, producing electricity for about 300,000 people. Federal hydropower facilities produce about 17 percent of all hydropower produced in the United States.
Most U.S. geothermal resources are in the western states, where most public lands are located. The sunny southwest has the greatest potential for solar energy production. Wind resources are more widespread, and there are federal lands in many of the most favorable areas.
The Secretaries of the Interior, Energy, and Agriculture are in the process of identifying renewable energy siting opportunities and reevaluating access restrictions on federal lands. Development limitations, including environmental considerations, must also be assessed. Federal agencies will also consider development incentives such as reduced site rental fees to encourage industry to more aggressively pursue renewable energy production.

Alternative energy production from federal lands lags behind conventional energy production, though the amount is still significant. For example, federal geothermal resources produce about 7.5 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity per year, 47 percent of all electricity generated from U.S. geothermal energy. There are 2,960 wind turbines on public lands in California alone, producing electricity for about 300,000 people. Federal hydropower facilities produce about 17 percent of all hydropower produced in the United States.
Most U.S. geothermal resources are in the western states, where most public lands are located. The sunny southwest has the greatest potential for solar energy production. Wind resources are more widespread, and there are federal lands in many of the most favorable areas.
The Secretaries of the Interior, Energy, and Agriculture are in the process of identifying renewable energy siting opportunities and reevaluating access restrictions on federal lands. Development limitations, including environmental considerations, must also be assessed. Federal agencies will also consider development incentives such as reduced site rental fees to encourage industry to more aggressively pursue renewable energy production.
Because of the growing U.S. thirst for energy and increasing public unease 
AND
mitigation measures may be imposed, or mineral production may be banned altogether.
BLM and other land managers have the delicate task of weighing energy production against competing 
AND
approaches and work collaboratively to find alternatives that can be accepted by all.

====Focus on spectacular politics create fixation on improbable and mask systemic violence- leaves the root causes of destruction and violence intact - that~’s Nixon- turns the DA because it makes conflicts in the long-run worse====
