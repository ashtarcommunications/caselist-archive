====The resolution indicates affs should advocate topical government change====
Ericson 3 (Jon M., Dean Emeritus of the College of Liberal Arts – California Polytechnic U., et al., The Debater~’s Guide, Third Edition, p. 4)

The Proposition of Policy: Urging Future Action In policy propositions, each topic contains 
AND
compelling reasons for an audience to perform the future action that you propose. 


====Specific, limited resolutions ensure mutual ground which is key to sustainable controversy without sacrificing creativity or openness====
Steinberg %26 Freeley 8 *Austin J. Freeley is a Boston based attorney who focuses on criminal, personal injury and civil rights law, AND **David L. Steinberg , Lecturer of Communication Studies @ U Miami, Argumentation and Debate: Critical Thinking for Reasoned Decision Making pp45-

Debate is a means of settling differences, so there must be a difference of 
AND
particular point of difference, which will be outlined in the following discussion.


====Deliberation requires a predetermined subject—they over-determine the rez more than us by assuming debates are the ultimate arbiter of its value as opposed to a means to facilitate clash====
Adolf G. Gundersen, Associate Professor of Political Science, Texas A%26M, 2000
POLITICAL THEORY AND PARTISAN POLITICS, 2000, p. 104-5. (DRGNS/E625)

Indirect political engagement is perhaps the single most important element of the strategy I am 
AND
limiting partisanship and stimulating deliberation are to an important extent the same question.


====Competition through fair play is a dialogical process that encourages argumentative testing and mutual recognition of personhood====
Rawls 58 – a leading figure in moral and political philosophy (John, Justice as Fairness, Philosophical Review, April, JSTOR)

Similarly, the acceptance of the duty of fair play by participants in a common 
AND
the principles of justice and the acknowledgment of the duty of fair play. 


====Topical fairness requirements are key to effective dialogue—monopolizing strategy and prep makes the discussion one-sided and subverts any meaningful neg role====
Galloway 7 – professor of communications at Samford University (Ryan, &amp;#34;Dinner And Conversation At The Argumentative Table: Reconceptualizing Debate As An Argumentative Dialogue&amp;#34;, Contemporary Argumentation and Debate, Vol. 28 (2007), ebsco)

Debate as a dialogue sets an argumentative table, where all parties receive a relatively 
AND
substitutes for topical action do not accrue the dialogical benefits of topical advocacy.


====Game spaces like debate are distinct from other forms of education and public speaking.  There has to be a balance of ground or else one side claims the moral high ground and creates a de facto monologue====
Hanghoj 2008 – PhD, assistant professor, School of Education, University of Aarhus, also affiliated with the Danish Research Centre on Education and Advanced Media Materials, located at the Institute of Literature, Media and Cultural Studies at the University of Southern Denmark (Thorkild, http://static.sdu.dk/mediafiles/Files/Information_til/Studerende_ved_SDU/Din_uddannelse/phd_hum/afhandlinger/2009/ThorkilHanghoej.pdf)

Debate games are often based on pre-designed scenarios that include descriptions of issues 
AND
dialogue as an end in itself&amp;#34; (Wegerif, 2006: 61). 


====Policy debates require positions that upset ideologies—side switching as a model for deliberation is valuable because it~’s distinct from pure discussion====
Gutmann and Thompson 1996 – *president of Penn, former professor at Princeton, ** Alfred North Whitehead Professor of Political Philosophy at Harvard (Amy and Dennis, &amp;#34;Democracy and disagreement&amp;#34;, p. 1)
	
OF THE CHALLENGES that 
AND
means for deciding what means are morally required to pursue our common ends.


====The impact outweighs—deliberative debate models impart skills vital to respond to existential threats====
Christian O. Lundberg 10 Professor of Communications @ University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, &amp;#34;Tradition of Debate in North Carolina&amp;#34; in Navigating Opportunity: Policy Debate in the 21st Century By Allan D. Louden, p. 311

The second major problem with the critique that identifies a naivety in articulating debate and 
AND
with the existential challenges to democracy ~~in an~~ increasingly complex world. 


====Deliberation is the best alternative to activism because it requires continual testing that bolsters advocacy and inclusion—refusal of side switching leads to group polarization and isolation====
Talisse 2005 – philosophy professor at Vanderbilt (Robert, Philosophy %26 Social Criticism, 31.4, &amp;#34;Deliberativist responses to activist challenges&amp;#34;) *note: gendered language in this article refers to arguments made by two specific individuals in an article by Iris Young 

Nonetheless, the deliberativist conception of reasonableness differs from the activist~’s in at least one crucial respect. On the deliberativist view, a necessary condition for reasonableness is the willingness not only to offer justifications for one~’s own views and actions, but also to listen to criticisms, objections, and the justificatory reasons that can be given in favor of alternative proposals.
In light of this further stipulation, we may say that, on the deliberative 
AND

of justice. Insofar as the activist denies this, he is unreasonable.


====Their critiques of debate miss the mark—defending a topic that involves the state for the sake of deliberation is distinct from accepting it, and limiting out some arguments for the sake of that deliberation is a more productive discourse that solves the aff better====
Talisse 2005 – philosophy professor at Vanderbilt (Robert, Philosophy %26 Social Criticism, 31.4, &amp;#34;Deliberativist responses to activist challenges&amp;#34;) *note: gendered language in this article refers to arguments made by two specific individuals in an article by Iris Young 

These two serious activist challenges may be summarized as follows. First, the activist 
AND
are distorting in important ways and that further discourse cannot remedy these distortions.


====Ideology is only shaken by agonistic spaces with arguments subject to testing and reconsideration on both sides—this is key to make competition productive====
Roberts-Miller 2003 – associate professor of rhetoric at the University of Texas (Patricia, JAC 22.2, &amp;#34;Fighting Without Hatred: Hannah Arendt~’s Agonistic Rhetoric&amp;#34;, http://www.jaconlinejournal.com/archives/vol22.3/miller-fighting.pdf)

Totalitarianism and the Competitive Space of Agonism
Arendt is probably most famous for her analysis of totalitarianism (especially her The Origins 
AND
not relativist, adversarial but not violent, independent but not expressivist rhetoric.


====Limits are key to activate agency with agonism—it~’s not a constraint on perspective but a way to channel difference toward effective contest====
Glover 2010 – professor of political science at U Conn (Robert, Philosophy and Social Criticism, 36, &amp;#34;Games without Frontiers?: Democratic Engagement, Agonistic Pluralism, and the Question of Exclusion&amp;#34;)

Recent democratic theory has devoted significant attention to the question of how to revitalize citizen 
AND
while retaining the recognition that democratic discourse must operate with limits and frontiers.





===2nc===


====Duffy is wrong====
Koehle 10
Joe Koehle, Phd candidate in communications at Kansas, former West Georgia debater
http://mccfblog.org/actr/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Koehle_Paper_ACTR-editedPDF.pdf.

Much like criticism of the sophists has persisted throughout time; criticism of switch side 
AND
capable of making sound decisions (Mitchell, &amp;#34;Pedagogical Possibilities&amp;#34;, 41).  


====Moral purism about institutional approaches dooms the aff—hierarchy should be deployed tactically for greater overall gains====
Grossberg, 92 ~~Lawrence, Morris Davis Professor of Communication Studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, &amp;#34;We Gotta Get Out of this Place: Popular Conservatism and Postmodern Culture&amp;#34;, page 388-389 //liam ~~

ÓThe demand for moral and ideological purity often results in the rejection of any 
AND
reasonably democratic structures of institutionalization, even if they are impure and compromised.  


====Refusal of the state empowers its worst aspects.  You don~’t have to be a technocrat but you should be anti-anti-state====
Barbrook, 97 – professor at the Hypermedia Research Centre at the University of Westminster (Richard, http://www.nettime.org/Lists-Archives/nettime-l-9706/msg00034.html)

I thought that this position is clear from my remarks about the ultra-left 
AND
can be a fun artistic pose. However, human suffering is not. 



====Radical pessimism is self-negating—values can only be incorporated if privileged individuals who recognize the harm of society have some role in a dialogic process—this proves they have no role of the negative in their framework====
Bell and Bansal 1988 – first tenured African-American Professor of Law at Harvard Law School, one of the originators of critical race theory, Visiting Professor at New York University School of Law, former Dean of the University of Oregon School of Law (Derrick Bell and Preeta Bansal, Yale Law Journal, 97.8, &amp;#34;Symposium: The Republican Civic Tradition&amp;#34;)

In so asking, Michelman demonstrates that he, like generations of black Americans, 
AND
that our humanity will not always be subordinated because we are not white. 


====The argument that our framework is systemically bias is a self-serving assertion to sidestep clash—all of their reasons not to defend the topic can be appropriated by actors with opposite goals====
Talisse 2005 – philosophy professor at Vanderbilt (Robert, Philosophy %26 Social Criticism, 31.4, &amp;#34;Deliberativist responses to activist challenges&amp;#34;) *note: gendered language in this article refers to arguments made by two specific individuals in an article by Iris Young 

My call for a more detailed articulation of the second activist challenge may be met 
AND
, activism entails a politics based upon interestbased power struggles amongst adversarial factions.


====Talisse is a critique of Young—deliberation is better than activism====
Talisse 2005 – philosophy professor at Vanderbilt (Robert, Philosophy %26 Social Criticism, 31.4, &amp;#34;Deliberativist responses to activist challenges&amp;#34;) *note: gendered language in this article refers to arguments made by two male figures in an article by Iris Young 

Accordingly, Young~’s dialectic between the deliberativist and the activist is of crucial import to 
AND
elements of the deliberative democrat~’s position that are insufficiently theorized in Young~’s presentation.


====Authenticity tests shut down debate—turns case and proves they turn dialogue into lecture====
Subotnik 1998 – professor of law, Touro College, Jacob D. Fuchsberg Law Center (7 Cornell J. L. %26 Pub. Pol~’y 681)

Having traced a major strand in the development of CRT, we turn now to 
AND

to faculty offices and, more generally, the streets and the airwaves.


====Personalization doesn~’t solve their offense—the absence of rules doesn~’t change power relations, it just hegemonic actors re-appropriate the same logic to insulate themselves from criticism.  Their approach is like trying to cure heart malfunction by eliminating hearts====
Tonn 2005 – Professor of Communications at the University of Maryland (Fall, Mari Boor, Rhetoric %26 Public Affairs, 8.3, &amp;#34;Taking Conversation, Dialogue, and Therapy Public&amp;#34;)
	
This widespread recognition that access to public deliberative processes and the ballot is a baseline 
AND
therapeutic conversation and dialogue jeopardizes the very pulse and lifeblood of democracy itself.


====The ballot makes debate a goal-oriented conversation—local experience has to be directed toward a topical stance or else it lapses into incontestability and the tyranny of structurelessness which becomes ineffective and stagnant====
Tonn 2005 – Professor of Communications at the University of Maryland (Fall, Mari Boor, Rhetoric %26 Public Affairs, 8.3, &amp;#34;Taking Conversation, Dialogue, and Therapy Public&amp;#34;)

In certain ways, Schudson~’s initial reluctance to dismiss public conversation echoes my own early 
AND
, conflicts, and inequities as personal failures subject to personal amelioration.&amp;#34;19 


===1nr===


====Restrictions pertain to the content of energy production, not its modalities.  The plan merely enables different place and timing of production – that~’s distinct====
Martin **Borowski** (Faculty at Birmingham Law School, Vice-President of the British Section of the International Association for Philosophy of Law and Social Philosophy) **2003** &amp;#34;Religious Freedom as a Fundamental Human Right, a Rawlsian Perspective&amp;#34; in Pluralism and Law, Conference Proceedings&amp;#34; p. 58

Where it is a question of the diminution of the content of basic liberties, 
AND
serve as an adequate reconstruction of the constitutional protection afforded to religious freedom.


====Precisely defining terms is pedagogically valuable—T debates provide portable skills needed to settle all major questions====
Steinberg %26 Freeley 8 *Austin J. Freeley is a Boston based attorney who focuses on criminal, personal injury and civil rights law, AND **David L. Steinberg , Lecturer of Communication Studies @ U Miami, Argumentation and Debate: Critical Thinking for Reasoned Decision Making pp61-63

I. THE IMPORTANCE OF DEFINING TERMS
The definition of terms—the advocate~’s supported interpretation of the meaning of the words 
AND
the definition of &amp;#34;terrorism&amp;#34; creates significant problems in our foreign policy.


====Side switching does not equate to speaking from nowhere or divesting yourself of social background—our argument is that if your only exposure to the topic is finding ways to critique or avoid it, then you become solely capable of preaching to the choir.  Debate is unique because it gives opportunities to tactically inhabit other perspectives without enlisting in those causes for the sake of skill development and mutual testing====
Haskell 1990 – history professor at Rice University (May, Thomas, History and Theory, 29.2, &amp;#34;Objectivity is Not Neutrality: Rhetoric vs. Practice in Peter Novick~’s That Noble Dream&amp;#34;, p. 129-157)

Detachment functions in this manner not by draining us of passion, but by helping 
AND
, or editorially splitting the difference between them, irrespective of their perceived merits


====Deliberation must be externally constrained by a topic to generative effective reasoning—devil~’s advocate norms check group polarization and cognitive bias====
Mercier and Landemore 2011 – *Philosophy, Politics and Economics prof @ U Penn, **Poli Sci prof @ Yale (Hugo and Hélène, Political Psychology, &amp;#34;Reasoning is for arguing: Understanding the successes and failures of deliberation&amp;#34;, http://sites.google.com/site/hugomercier/publications)

Reasoning can function outside of its normal conditions when it is used purely internally. 
AND
(e.g. Schweiger, Sandberg, %26 Ragan, 1986).


====Debate is distinct from public speaking—defending something for competitive purposes generates reasoned convictions which turns their impact====
Galloway, 7 –professor of communications at Samford University (Ryan, &amp;#34;Dinner and Conversation at the Argumentative Table: Reconceptualizing Debate as an Argumentative Dialogue&amp;#34;, Contemporary Argumentation and Debate, Vol. 28 (2007), ebsco)

Falsely Comparing Debate with Public Speaking 
The argument that debaters should not argue in favor of ¶ ideas that they do 
AND
from a neutral ¶ position so that they may be freely chosen subsequently. 


====The Fermi nuclear reactor accident was a net plus — nobody died, no radiation was released and it ultimately lead to safer reactor designs of the future. No technology is risk-free, nuclear energy is safer than coal or fossil fuels and continuously improves in response to accidents but overall has an exemplary safety record — their 1ac scare-tactics misunderstand improvements in reactor design since Fermi — their flawed analysis is a reason to vote negative====

WNA ~’12 September, World Nuclear Association &amp;#34;Safety of Nuclear Power Reactors&amp;#34; http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf06.html

It should be emphasised that a commercial-type power reactor simply cannot under any 
AND
in 1979 which will have significant implications, at least for older plants.

WASHINGTON — With attention turning to the first of three upcoming national debates, new 
AND
to move Romney ahead, it could make for a much closer race.


====The plan makes China a pivotal election issue – China bashing gave the GOP the advantage in the midterms====
Yingzi, 10 (Tan, &amp;#34;US likely to give nod to CNOOC deal, despite opposition&amp;#34; 10/14, China Daily,

Several proposed Chinese investment projects in the US have encountered political obstacles this year. Some Congress members blamed China for the high US unemployment rate and regard the emerging economy~’s global expansion as a national security threat.
China has appeared as a &amp;#34;scapegoat&amp;#34; for the wobbly US economy in the fierce campaign for November~’s midterm elections. At least 29 candidates have aired advertisements blaming their opponents for being too sympathetic to China, the New York Times reported on Saturday.
Strong political opposition to the CNOOC deal is likely, given the recent congressional objections to Anshan Iron and Steel Group~’s investment in a small US steel company, said Scissors from the Heritage Foundation.

A terribly counterproductive and arbitrarily political ruling of the Obama administration to shut down the

An emerging narrative in 2012 is that a proliferation of protectionist, treaty-violating
AND
that suggests that the kerfuffle is containable and the recent trend reversible.1


====No net increase in protectionism====

It seems that free-trade and protectionist tendencies are fairly evenly balanced among the

Does globalization pacify international relations? The &amp;#34;liberal&amp;#34; view in political science argues

So far, China~’s FDI outflows have been concentrated in developing countries and a handful

China~’s energy policies and institutions accentuate demand growth and aggravate energy supply and infrastructure shortages
AND
security, not just the &amp;#34;low politics&amp;#34; of domestic economic policy.


====US demand is crucial to oil exporter revenue – transition to domestic energy would devastate petrostates====

Moreover, the trace is activated and manifests as a political phenomenon that unfolds in the violent and brutal reality of (ex)colonial territories. Thus, we could argue that a post-colonial set of problems underlines the artistic procedure making reason unstable, displacing its centrality as an organizing axiom, and doing so by bringing into play other categories such as death, expenditure, and the concealed pulsations of the libidinal economy: that is, explicitly, by underpinning the inscription of sacrifice as central to a mapping of the human.

The critical task marks the extent to which the notion of sacrifice suffers an intrinsic indetermination in its multiple manifestations, working simultaneously as: theoretical operative (device-//dispositif//), historical structure, concept-metaphor, ideological device, symbolic economy, archeological evidence, juridical foundation of the state, the “secret” grammar of power and, also, a counter-image (hieroglyph) for a project of total revolt (i.e. the dismantling of the order of representation-domination). These examples come exclusively from the realm of art and its discourse (although all of them have heterogeneous correlates in the sphere of politics and the archive of history). Perhaps because the character —at once concealed and folded— of the problem of sacrifice as the //repressed representative //operating within instrumental reason has displaced its clear formulation (enunciation) as precisely a form of articulation that manifests mostly as (a) program(s) for a kind of radical aesthetics.

Discussing the //motivations// for production, the attempt was to try and replace the vocabulary of the strategical paradigm—the lingo of declared intentions and the cocksure construction of references—with more shaky terms like //inspiration//, //vocation// and //dedication//: terms that, precisely because of their existential dimension, exist on the threshold of the unverifiable, and therefore always remain riddled by Iron Maiden’s tormenting question “How can I be sure that what I saw last night was real and not just fantasy?” (Orpheus tried to check and he blew it.) (% style=&amp;#34;font-size:14.0pt;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)__In pursuit of the notion of dedication, the question of //care// as the ulimate existential motivation (__(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:14.0pt&amp;#34; %)__Why do we do what we do? ‘Cos we care.) __(% style=&amp;#34;font-size: 14pt; background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow&amp;#34; %)__was raised, exposing its ambivalent position on the threshold of the symbolic: always drawn into a symbolic economy of tit for tat, care still remains unconditional and therefore excessive, empowered by the need of the other__(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:14.0pt&amp;#34; %)__,__(%%) and, precisely because of this, always deprived of a safe symbolic mandate, since the nature of the other remains fundamentally indeterminable. For who would know what anyone really needed? On this limit of acknowledging the missing mandate, the locomotif of a creature appeared in the history of painting: the lion that walked into St. Jerome’s study one day, thorn in paw. Jerome, being a translator, no certified cat-doctor, unprepared and without symbolic mandate, plucked the thorn anyway, intiating a social mode of conviviality with the wild cat without a contract, economy or grand narrative to symbolically validate it. The only reason for this being possible was perhaps that his study (as Antonello da Messina and Vincenzo Catena depict it) was a semi-public space, open to the occurence of such events. Animals then continued to linger on the threshold of the symbolic, as creatures that wiggle, that embody the motion of emotion and the effect of affect on the soul, as witnesses to this effect in ways that are not entirely reducable to symbolic signification. This final talk will try to substantiate this intuition further by looking at the locomotif of Orpheus and the animals which continued through the centuries to manifest intuitions about the affective effect of art and the kind of creaturely social bond it may initiate. As the muse Kaliope’s child, the figure of Orpheus may aso bring us back to the question of inspiration as (demonic) amusement in the society of the muses (the museum as pan-demonium).

This clash of world views, which has informed the American debate since colonial times, resounds still in books like McFeely’s. The poignant stories he tells, of three men who committed terrible crimes, of their defenders, their victims and of the criminal justice system, are embedded in a twisted past and in very different visions of how a new world is to be made. (% style=&amp;#34;font-size:14.0pt;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)__One of the many strengths of his __(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:14.0pt&amp;#34; %)__elegant, humane and subtle __(% style=&amp;#34;font-size: 14pt; background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow&amp;#34; %)__book is to show how the claims and counterclaims __(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:14.0pt&amp;#34; %)__that are so __(% style=&amp;#34;font-size: 14pt; background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow&amp;#34; %)__often made like points in a college debate – a ‘pro’ parry met by an ‘anti’ retort – are freighted with the burdens of history and the ironies of modernity. In the United States no burden is heavier than that of race__(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt&amp;#34; %). McFeely became involved with the question of the death penalty not because of any expertise in criminology – he had none – but because he had written a biography of Frederick Douglass and a book about the 67 descendants of a slave who had been brought to the tiny barrier island of Sapelo in 1802, where they still live today. Stephen Bright, the indefatigable and brilliant lead counsel of the Southern Center for Human Rights, wanted to make use of McFeely’s expertise in African American history. Specifically, Bright asked him to testify in support of two claims which he was making in a motion for a new trial. Bright’s client is – the case is not yet resolved – Carzell Moore, a black man convicted, along with an accomplice, of the rape and murder of a 23-year-old white convenience store clerk. He is awaiting execution. Bright planned to argue, first, that under the terms of the 14th Amendment a black man is not ‘equally protected’ in a Georgia courtroom which, like all the others in the state, displays the Confederate battle flag. And second, that there is an intimate connection between that flag and the bitter history of lynching which underscores the death sentence of any black man in the United States, particularly in the South. In some abstract sense, the flag might represent a proud tradition of states’ rights and benign local tradition, as its defenders in South Carolina have recently claimed. But in fact, as McFeely testified, the Georgia story is unambiguous. On 6 February 1956, its Governor vowed that no Negro child would ever attend school with a white one; three days later, the legislature voted to replace the Confederate horizontal bars that had graced the state flag since 1879 with the ‘stars and bars’: the blue and white cross of St Andrew on an in-your-face field of bright red. Its Civil War service done, this banner had rallied the Ku Klux Klan as it helped re-establish white power in the South during a half-century reign of terror. When, in 1993, the then Georgia Governor asked the legislature to remove this none to0 subtle exhibition of ‘pride in the enslavement of many of our ancestors’ he was jeered at, and finally withdrew his proposal after some months of hopeless advocacy. (% style=&amp;#34;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)__There have been 460 lynchings in Georgia since the late 19th century__(%%)__; 411 were of blacks. And, as Bright went on to argue in court, the surge in judicial executions after lynching declined in the 1930s could plausibly be interpreted as the swift removal of a black man by trial, which before had been effected by mob. (% style=&amp;#34;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)The cries of ‘burn ‘em’ heard as a murder suspect is booked today echo the cries of those festive crowds that attended the hangings, immolations and castrations of earlier years(%%).__(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&amp;#34; %) The prosecutor who opposed Bright’s motion for retrial responded – correctly, in a narrow sense – that this was all quite irrelevant. These facts had no particularly bearing on Carzell Moore; no one was proposing that he be lynched.

Land in 1977 presided over the trial of a black man called William Brooks, whose case McFeely follows. Land is the son of a prominent local dignitary who had seen to the lynching of an adolescent boy 65 years earlier. The barefoot ‘little black nigger’ in question had, miraculously, escaped a murder conviction in the accidental shooting of a white boy. T.Z. Cotton – the white press and courts of his day never managed to get his name right – was kidnapped from the same Muscogee County Courthouse where Brooks was tried, taken to the edge of town and, begging for his life, pumped full of bullets. Brewster Land, Judge Land’s father, was acquitted; none of those who witnessed the abduction and murder would come forward. Forty-four years later, in 1956, a prominent black physician and civil rights leader in the same Georgia town was murdered in the course of a political confrontation: an all-white grand jury refused to indict the white man who shot him – self-defence. Even if, as is clearly the case, the murder trial of Brooks was not a lynching, the distinction is lost on many.

Before we look specifically at how we can combine games with learning, let us examine games themselves in some detail.  Like fun and play, game is a word of many meanings and implications. How can we define a game? Is there any useful distinction between fun, play and games? What makes games engaging? How do we design them?  Games are a subset of both play and fun. In programming jargon they are a “child”, inheriting all the characteristics of the “parents.” They therefore carry both the good and the bad of both terms. Games, as we will see, also have some special qualities, which make them particularly appropriate and well suited for learning.   So what is a game?  Like play, game, has a wide variety of meanings, some positive, some negative. On the negative side there is mocking and jesting, illegal and shady activity such as a con game, as well as the “fun and games” that we saw earlier. As noted, these can be sources of resistance to Digital Game-Based Learning — “we are not playing games here.” But much of that is semantic. What we are interested in here are the meanings that revolve around the definition of games involving rules, contest, rivalry and struggle.    (%%)__What Makes a Game a Game? __(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:7.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-language:EN-US&amp;#34; %)Six Structural Factors  The Encyclopedia Britannica provides the following diagram of the relation between play and games: 35 PLAY  spontaneous play    organized play (GAMES)         noncompetitive games   (% style=&amp;#34;mso-bidi-font-size: 9.0pt;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)__competitive games__(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:7.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-language:EN-US&amp;#34; %) (CONTESTS) (% style=&amp;#34;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)__intellectual contests__(% style=&amp;#34;font-size: 7.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-language:EN-US&amp;#34; %)   physical contests (SPORTS)   Our goal here is to understand why games engage us, drawing us in often in spite of ourselves.  This powerful force stems first from the fact that they are a form of fun and play, and second from what I call the six key structural elements of games:  1. Rules 2. Goals and Objectives 3. Outcomes and Feedback 4. Conflict/Competition/Challenge/Opposition  5. Interaction, and 6. Representation or Story.   There are thousands, perhaps millions of different games, but all contain most, if not all, these powerful factors. Those that don’t contain all the factors are still classified as games by many, but can also belong to other subclasses described below. In addition to these structural factors, there are also important design elements that add to engagement and distinguish a really good game from a poor or mediocre one. Let us discuss these six factors in detail and show how and why they lead to such strong engagement.(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:7.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family:TimesNewRomanPSMT;mso-bidi-language:EN-US&amp;#34; %) (% style=&amp;#34;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)__Rules are what differentiate games from other kinds of play__(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:7.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow;mso-bidi-language:EN-US&amp;#34; %)__. __(% style=&amp;#34;mso-bidi-font-size: 9.0pt;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)__Probably the most basic definition of a game is that it is organized play, that is to say rule-based__(%%)__.

In short, (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; %)educational gaming is a form of teaching(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:7.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&amp;#34; %). As mentioned, education and games represent two different semiotic domains that both embody the three faces of knowledge: assertions, modes of representation and social forms of organisation (Gee, 2003; Barth, 2002; cf. chapter 2). In order to understand the interplay between these different domains and their interrelated knowledge forms, I will draw attention to a central assumption in Bakhtin’s dialogical philosophy. According to Bakhtin, (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; %)all forms of communication and culture are subject to centripetal and centrifugal forces(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:7.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&amp;#34; %) (Bakhtin, 1981). (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; style=&amp;#34;background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)A centripetal force is the drive to impose one(% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; %) version of the (% style=&amp;#34;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)truth(%%), while (% style=&amp;#34;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)a centrifugal force involves a range of(%%) possible truths and (% style=&amp;#34;background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)interpretations(%%).(% style=&amp;#34;font-size: 7.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&amp;#34; %) This means that any form of expression involves a duality of centripetal and centrifugal forces: “Every concrete utterance of a speaking subject serves as a point where centrifugal as well as centripetal forces are brought to bear” (Bakhtin, 1981: 272). If we take teaching as an example, it is always affected by centripetal and centrifugal forces in the on-going negotiation of “truths” between teachers and students. In the words of Bakhtin: “Truth is not born nor is it to be found inside the head of an individual person, it is born between people collectively searching for truth, in the process of their dialogic interaction” (Bakhtin, 1984a: 110). Similarly, (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; %)the (% style=&amp;#34;background: yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)dialogical (%%)space of (% style=&amp;#34;background: yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)debate games also embodies centrifugal and centripetal forces(%%). Thus, the election scenario of The Power Game involves (% style=&amp;#34;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)centripetal elements(%%) that (% style=&amp;#34;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)are mainly(%%) determined by the (% style=&amp;#34;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)rules(%%) and outcomes of the game(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:7.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt&amp;#34; %), i.e. the election is based on a limited time frame and a fixed voting procedure.

(% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; style=&amp;#34;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)Consequently, the actual process of (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; %)enacting a game scenario involves a complex negotiation between these(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:7.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&amp;#34; %) centrifugal/centripetal (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; %)forces(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:7.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&amp;#34; %) that are inextricably linked with the teachers and students’ game activities. In this way, the enactment of The Power Game is a form of teaching that combines different pedagogical practices (i.e. group work, web quests, student presentations) and learning resources (i.e. websites, handouts, spoken language) within the interpretive frame of the election scenario. Obviously, tensions may arise if there is too much divergence between educational goals and game goals. This means that (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; style=&amp;#34;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)game facilitation requires a balance (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; %)between focusing too narrowly on the rules(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:7.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&amp;#34; %) or “facts” of a game (centripetal orientation) (% class=&amp;#34;UnderlineBold&amp;#34; style=&amp;#34;font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&amp;#34; %)and a focusing too broadly on the contingent possibilities and interpretations of the game scenario (centrifugal orientation(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:7.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&amp;#34; %)). For Bakhtin, (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; %)the duality(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:7.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&amp;#34; %) of centripetal/centrifugal forces (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; %)often manifests itself as a dynamic between “monological” and “dialogical” forms of discourse(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:7.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&amp;#34; %). Bakhtin illustrates this point (% class=&amp;#34;UnderlineBold&amp;#34; style=&amp;#34;font-size:10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)with (% class=&amp;#34;UnderlineBold&amp;#34; style=&amp;#34;font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&amp;#34; %)the (% class=&amp;#34;UnderlineBold&amp;#34; style=&amp;#34;font-size: 10pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12pt; background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow&amp;#34; %)monological discourse (% class=&amp;#34;UnderlineBold&amp;#34; style=&amp;#34;font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&amp;#34; %)of the Socrates/Plato dialogues(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&amp;#34; %) in which (% class=&amp;#34;UnderlineBold&amp;#34; style=&amp;#34;font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)**the teacher never learns anything new**(% class=&amp;#34;UnderlineBold&amp;#34; style=&amp;#34;font-size: 10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&amp;#34; %) from the students(% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; %), despite Socrates’ ideological claims to the contrary (% style=&amp;#34;font-size:7.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&amp;#34; %)(Bakhtin, 1984a).

In contrast to this, dialogical pedagogy fosters inclusive learning environments that are able to expand upon students’ existing knowledge and collaborative construction of “truths” (Dysthe, 1996).

(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:7.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&amp;#34; %)Joas’ re-interpretation of Dewey’s pragmatism as a “theory of situated creativity” raises a critique of humans as purely rational agents that navigate instrumentally through meansends- schemes (Joas, 1996: 133f). This critique is particularly important when trying to understand how (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; style=&amp;#34;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)games(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:7.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow&amp;#34; %) (% style=&amp;#34;font-size:7.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&amp;#34; %)are enacted and validated (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; %)with(% style=&amp;#34;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)in(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:7.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow&amp;#34; %) (% style=&amp;#34;font-size:7.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&amp;#34; %)the realm of (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; style=&amp;#34;background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)educational institutions(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:7.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow&amp;#34; %) (% style=&amp;#34;font-size:7.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&amp;#34; %)that by definition are inscribed in the great modernistic narrative of “progress” where nation states, teachers and parents expect students to acquire specific skills and competencies (Popkewitz, 1998; cf. chapter 3). However, as Dewey argues, the actual doings of educational gaming (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; %)cannot be reduced to rational means-ends schemes. (% style=&amp;#34;font-size:7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&amp;#34; %)Instead, the situated interaction between teachers, students, and learning resources are played out as contingent re-distributions of means, ends and ends in view, (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; %)which (% style=&amp;#34;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)often make classroom contexts seem “messy” (%%)from an outsider’s perspective(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:7.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&amp;#34; %) (Barab and Squire, 2004). 4.2.3.

For now, I will turn to Dewey’s concept of dramatic rehearsal, which assumes that (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; style=&amp;#34;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)social actors deliberate by (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; %)projecting and(% style=&amp;#34;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %) choosing between (%%)various (% style=&amp;#34;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)scenarios (%%)for future action.(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:7.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&amp;#34; %) Dewey uses the concept dramatic rehearsal several times in his work but presents the most extensive elaboration in Human Nature and Conduct: (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; %)Deliberation is a dramatic rehearsal(% style=&amp;#34;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %) (in imagination) of (%%)various (% style=&amp;#34;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)competing (%%)possible (% style=&amp;#34;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)lines of action(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:7.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&amp;#34; %)… It is an experiment in finding out what the various lines of possible action are really like (...) (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; %)Thought runs ahead and foresees outcomes, and thereby avoids having to await the instruction of actual failure(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:7.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&amp;#34; %) and disaster. An act overtly tried out is irrevocable, its consequences cannot be blotted out. (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; style=&amp;#34;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)An act tried out in imagination is not final (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; %)or fatal. It is retrievable(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:7.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&amp;#34; %) (Dewey, 1922: 132-3). (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; %)This excerpt illustrates how Dewey views the process of decision making (deliberation) through the lens of an imaginative drama metaphor. Thus, decisions are made through the imag(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:7.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt&amp;#34; %)inative projection of outcomes, where the “(% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; %)possible (% style=&amp;#34;background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow&amp;#34; %)competing lines of action” are resolved through a thought experiment(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:7.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&amp;#34; %). Moreover, Dewey’s compelling use of the drama metaphor also implies that decisions cannot be reduced to utilitarian, rational or mechanical exercises, but that they have emotional, creative and personal qualities as well. Interestingly, there are relatively few discussions within the vast research literature on Dewey of his concept of dramatic rehearsal. A notable exception is the phenomenologist A(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:7.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:Arial&amp;#34; %)lfred (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; %)Schütz,(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:7.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:Arial&amp;#34; %) who (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; %)praises Dewey’s concept as a “fortunate image” for understanding everyday rationality(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:7.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&amp;#34; %) (Schütz, 1943: 140). Other attempts are primarily related to overall discussions on moral or ethical deliberation (Caspary, 1991, 2000, 2006; Fesmire, 1995, 2003; Rönssön, 2003; McVea, 2006). As Fesmire points out, dramatic rehearsal is intended to describe an important phase of deliberation that does not characterise the whole process of making moral decisions, which includes “duties and contractual obligations, short and long-term consequences, traits of character to be affected, and rights” (Fesmire, 2003: 70). Instead, (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; %)dramatic rehearsal should be seen as the process of “crystallizing possibilities and transforming them into(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:7.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt&amp;#34; %) directive (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; %)hypotheses”(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:7.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&amp;#34; %) (Fesmire, 2003: 70). Thus, (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; style=&amp;#34;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)deliberation can in no way guarantee(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:7.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt&amp;#34; %) that (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; %)the response of (% style=&amp;#34;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)a “thought experiment” will be successful(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:7.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&amp;#34; %).

The notion of (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; %)dramatic rehearsal provides a valuable perspective for understanding educational gaming as(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&amp;#34; %) a simultaneously (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; %)real and imagined inquiry into domain-specific scenarios.(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:7.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&amp;#34; %) Dewey defines dramatic rehearsal as the capacity to stage and evaluate “acts”, which implies an “irrevocable” difference between acts that are “tried out in imagination” and acts that are “overtly tried out” with real-life consequences (Dewey, 1922: (% style=&amp;#34;font-size:7.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family:Arial&amp;#34; %)132-3). (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; %)This (% style=&amp;#34;font-size: 7.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&amp;#34; %)description shares obvious similarities with (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; %)games(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:7.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt&amp;#34; %) as they (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; %)require (% style=&amp;#34;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)participants (%%)to inquire into and (% style=&amp;#34;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)resolve scenario-specific problems(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&amp;#34; %) (cf. chapter 2).

(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:6.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&amp;#34; %)The watchwords for the intelligence community’s debating initiative— collaboration, critical thinking, collective awareness—resonate with key terms anchoring the study of deliberative democracy. In a major new text, John Gastil defines deliberation as a process whereby people “carefully examine a problem and arrive at a well-reasoned solution aft er a period of inclusive, respectful consideration of diverse points of view.”40 Gastil and his colleagues in organizations such as the Kettering Foundation and the National Coalition for Dialogue and Deliberation are pursuing a research program that foregrounds the democratic telos of deliberative processes. Work in this area features a blend of concrete interventions and studies of citizen empowerment.41 Notably, a key theme in (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; %)much(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:6.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt&amp;#34; %) of this (%%)//literature concerns the relationship between deliberation and debate, with the latter//(% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; style=&amp;#34;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %) (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; %)term (%%)//often loaded with pejorative baggage//(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:6.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow&amp;#34; %) (% style=&amp;#34;font-size:6.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&amp;#34; %)and working as a negative foil to highlight the positive qualities of deliberation.42 “Most political discussions, however, are debates. Stories in the media turn politics into a never-ending series of contests. People get swept into taking sides; their energy goes into figuring out who or what they’re for or against,” says Kettering president David Mathews and coauthor Noelle McAfee. “(% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; style=&amp;#34;background: yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)Deliberation is (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; %)different.

One conceptual mechanism for reinforcing this debate-deliberation opposition is characterization of debate as a process inimical to deliberative aims, with debaters adopting dogmatic and fixed positions that frustrate the deliberative objective of “choice work.” In this register, Emily Robertson   observes, “unlike deliberators, debaters are typically not open to the possibility of being shown wrong. . . . Debaters are not trying to find the best solution by keeping an open mind about the opponent’s point of view.”44 Similarly, founding documents from the University of Houston–Downtown’s Center for Public Deliberation state, “Public deliberation is about choice work, which is different from a dialogue or a debate. In dialogue, people oft en look to relate to each other, to understand each other, and to talk about more informal issues. In debate, there are generally two positions and people are generally looking to ‘win’ their side.”45 (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; style=&amp;#34;background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)Debate, (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; %)cast(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&amp;#34; %) here (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; style=&amp;#34;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)as (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; %)the theoretical (% style=&amp;#34;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)scapegoat(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:6.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&amp;#34; %), provides a convenient, low-water benchmark for explaining how other forms of deliberative interaction better promote cooperative “choice work.” (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; %)The(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:6.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt&amp;#34; %) Kettering-inspired (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; %)framework (% style=&amp;#34;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)receives support from perversions of the(%%) debate (% style=&amp;#34;background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow&amp;#34; %)process such as vapid presidential debates and verbal pyrotechnics(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:6.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow&amp;#34; %) (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; %)found on Crossfire-style(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:6.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&amp;#34; %) television shows.46 (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; %)In contrast, the intelligence community’s debating initiative stands as a(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:6.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt&amp;#34; %) nettlesome (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; %)anomaly (% style=&amp;#34;font-size:6.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&amp;#34; %)for these theoretical frameworks, (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; %)with debate serving(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:6.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&amp;#34; %), rather than frustrating, (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; %)the ends of deliberation(% style=&amp;#34;font-size: 6.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&amp;#34; %). The presence of (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; %)such an anomaly would seem to point to the wisdom of fashioning a theoretical orientation that frames the debate-deliberation connection in contingent, rather than static terms(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:6.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&amp;#34; %), with the relationship between the categories shift ing along with the various contexts in which they manifest in practice.47 Such an approach gestures toward the importance of rhetorically informed critical work on multiple levels. First, the contingency of situated practice invites analysis geared to assess, in particular cases, the extent to which debate practices enable and/ or constrain deliberative objectives. Regarding the intelligence community’s debating initiative, such an analytical perspective highlights, for example, the tight connection between the deliberative goals established by intelligence officials and the cultural technology manifest in the bridge project’s online debating applications such as Hot Grinds. An additional dimension of nuance emerging from this avenue of analysis pertains to the precise nature of the deliberative goals set by bridge. Program descriptions notably eschew Kettering-style references to democratic citizen empowerment, yet feature deliberation prominently as a key ingredient of strong intelligence tradecraft . Th is caveat is especially salient to consider when it comes to the second category of rhetorically informed critical work invited by the contingent aspect of specific debate initiatives. To grasp this   layer it is useful to appreciate how the name of the bridge project constitutes an invitation for those outside the intelligence community to participate in the analytic outreach eff ort. According to Doney, bridge “provides an environment for Analytic Outreach—a place where IC analysts can reach out to expertise elsewhere in federal, state, and local government, in academia, and industry. New communities of interest can form quickly in bridge through the ‘web of trust’ access control model—access to minds outside the intelligence community creates an analytic force multiplier.”48 This presents a moment of choice for academic scholars in a position to respond to Doney’s invitation; it is an opportunity to convert scholarly expertise into an “analytic force multiplier.” In reflexively pondering this invitation, it may be valuable for scholars to read (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; %)Greene and Hicks’s proposition that switch-side debating should be viewed as a cultural technology(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:6.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&amp;#34; %) in light of Langdon Winner’s maxim that “technological artifacts have politics.”49 In the case of bridge, politics are informed by the history of intelligence community policies and practices. Commenter Th omas Lord puts this point in high relief in a post off ered in response to a news story on the topic: “Why should this thing (‘bridge’) be? . . . Th e intelligence community on the one hand sometimes provides useful information to the military or to the civilian branches and on the other hand it is a dangerous, out of control, relic that by all external appearances is not the slightest bit reformed, other than superficially, from such excesses as became exposed in the cointelpro and mkultra hearings of the 1970s.”50 A debate scholar need not agree with Lord’s full-throated criticism of the intelligence community (he goes on to observe that it bears an alarming resemblance to organized crime) to understand that participation in the community’s Analytic Outreach program may serve the ends of deliberation, but not necessarily democracy, or even a defensible politics. Demand-driven rhetoric of science necessarily raises questions about what’s driving the demand, questions that scholars with relevant expertise would do well to ponder carefully before embracing invitations to contribute their argumentative expertise to deliberative projects. By the same token, it would be prudent to bear in mind that (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; %)the technological determinism about switch-side debate endorsed by Greene and Hicks may tend to flatten reflexive assessments regarding the wisdom of supporting a given debate initiative—as the next section illustrates, manifest differences among initiatives warrant context-sensitive judgments regarding the normative political dimensions featured in each case(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:6.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt&amp;#34; %).

In so doing, the differing, oft en tacitly held contextual perspectives and values could be juxtaposed; the viewpoints and demands of experts, special interest groups, and the wider public could be directly compared; and the dynamics among the participants could be scrutizined. (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; %)This would by no means sideline or even exclude scientific assessment; it would only situate it within the framework of a more comprehensive evaluation.(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:6.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&amp;#34; %)55 As Davis notes, institutional constraints present within the EPA communicative milieu can complicate eff orts to provide a full airing of all relevant arguments pertaining to a given regulatory issue. Thus, (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; style=&amp;#34;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)intercollegiate debaters can play key roles(% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; %) in retrieving and (% style=&amp;#34;background: yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)amplifying positions that might otherwise remain sedimented in (%%)the (% style=&amp;#34;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)policy (%%)process(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:6.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&amp;#34; %). The dynamics entailed in this symbiotic relationship are underscored by deliberative planner John Forester, who observes, “If planners and public administrators are to make democratic political debate and argument possible, they will need strategically located allies to avoid being fully thwarted by the characteristic self-protecting behaviors of the planning organizations and bureaucracies within which they work.”56 Here, an institution’s need for “strategically located allies” to support deliberative practice constitutes the demand for rhetorically informed expertise, setting up what can be considered a demand-driven rhetoric of science. (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; %)As an instance of rhetoric of science scholarship, this type of “switch-side public (% style=&amp;#34;font-size:6.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&amp;#34; %)108 Rhetoric and Public Affairs (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; %)debate” differs both from insular contest tournament debating, where the main focus is on the pedagogical benefit for student participants, and first-generation rhetoric of science scholarship, where critics concentrated on unmasking the rhetoricity of scientific artifacts(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:6.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&amp;#34; %) circulating in what many perceived to be purely technical spheres of knowledge production.58 (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; %)As a form of demand-driven rhetoric of science, (% style=&amp;#34;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)switch-side (%%)debating (% style=&amp;#34;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)connects (%%)directly (% style=&amp;#34;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)with (%%)the communication field’s performative tradition of (% style=&amp;#34;background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow&amp;#34; %)argumentative engagement(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %) (% style=&amp;#34;font-size:6.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&amp;#34; %)in public controversy—(% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; style=&amp;#34;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)a different route(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:6.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %) (% style=&amp;#34;font-size: 6.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&amp;#34; %)of theoretical grounding (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; style=&amp;#34;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)than (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; %)rhetorical criticism’s tendency to locate its foundations in(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:6.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&amp;#34; %) the English field’s tradition of (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; style=&amp;#34;background: yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)literary criticism and textual analysis(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:6.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&amp;#34; %).59 Given this genealogy, it is not surprising to learn how Davis’s response to the EPA’s institutional need for rhetorical expertise took the form of a public debate proposal, shaped by Davis’s dual background as a practitioner and historian of intercollegiate debate. Davis competed as an undergraduate policy debater for Howard University in the 1970s, and then went on to enjoy substantial success as coach of the Howard team in the new millennium. In an essay reviewing the broad sweep of debating history, Davis notes, “Academic debate began at least 2,400 years ago when the scholar Protagoras of Abdera (481–411 bc), known as the father of debate, conducted debates among his students in Athens.”60 As John Poulakos points out, “older” (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; style=&amp;#34;background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)Sophists(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %) (% style=&amp;#34;font-size:6.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&amp;#34; %)such as Protagoras (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; style=&amp;#34;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)taught (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; %)Greek students the value of dissoi logoi, or (% style=&amp;#34;background: yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)pulling apart complex questions by debating two sides of an issue(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:6.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt&amp;#34; %).61 The few surviving fragments of Protagoras’s work suggest that his notion of dissoi logoi stood for the principle that “two accounts logoi are present about every ‘thing,’ opposed to each other,” and further, that humans could “measure” the relative soundness of knowledge claims by engaging in give-and-take where parties would make the “weaker argument stronger” to activate the generative aspect of rhetorical practice, a key element of the Sophistical tradition.62 Following in Protagoras’s wake, Isocrates would complement this centrifugal push with the pull of synerchesthe, a centripetal exercise of “coming together” deliberatively to listen, respond, and form common social bonds.63 Isocrates incorporated Protagorean dissoi logoi into synerchesthe, a broader concept that he used flexibly to express interlocking senses of (1) inquiry, as in groups convening to search for answers to common questions through discussion;64 (2) deliberation, with interlocutors gathering in a political setting to deliberate about proposed courses of action;65 and (3) alliance formation, a form of collective action typical at festivals,66 or in the exchange of pledges that deepen social ties.67 Switch-Side Debating Meets Demand-Driven Rhetoric of Science 109 Returning once again to the Kettering-informed sharp distinction between debate and deliberation, (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; style=&amp;#34;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)one sees (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; %)in(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:6.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&amp;#34; %) Isocratic (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; %)synerchesthe,(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:6.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&amp;#34; %) as well as in the EPA debating initiative, a (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; %)fusion of (% style=&amp;#34;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)debate with deliberative functions(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:6.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&amp;#34; %). Echoing a theme raised in this essay’s earlier discussion of intelligence tradecraft , such a fusion troubles categorical attempts to classify debate and deliberation as fundamentally opposed activities. Th e significance of such a finding is amplified by the frequency of attempts in the deliberative democracy literature to insist on the theoretical bifurcation of debate and deliberation as an article of theoretical faith. (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; %)Tandem analysis of(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:6.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&amp;#34; %) the EPA and intelligence community (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; %)debating initiatives also brings to light(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:6.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt&amp;#34; %) dimensions of contrast at the third level of Isocratic synerchesthe, alliance formation. Th e intelligence community’s Analytic Outreach initiative invites largely one-way communication flowing from outside experts into the black box of classified intelligence analysis. On the contrary, the EPA debating program gestures toward a more expansive project of (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; %)deliberative alliance building(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:6.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&amp;#34; %). In this vein, Howard University’s participation in the 2008 EPA Water Wars debates can be seen as the harbinger of a trend by historically black colleges and universities (hbcus) to catalyze their debate programs in a strategy that evinces Davis’s dual-focus vision. On the one hand, Davis aims to recuperate Wiley College’s tradition of competitive excellence in intercollegiate debate, depicted so powerfully in the feature film The Great Debaters, by starting a wave of new debate programs housed in hbcus across the nation.68 On the other hand, Davis sees potential for these new programs to complement their competitive debate programming with participation in the EPA’s public debating initiative. Th is dual-focus vision recalls Douglas Ehninger’s and Wayne Brockriede’s vision of “total” debate programs that blend switch-side intercollegiate tournament debating with forms of public debate designed to contribute to wider communities beyond the tournament setting.69 Whereas the political telos animating Davis’s dual-focus vision certainly embraces background assumptions that Greene and Hicks would find disconcerting—notions of liberal political agency, the idea of debate using “words as weapons”70—there is little doubt that the project of pursuing environmental protection by tapping the creative energy of hbcu-leveraged dissoi logoi differs significantly from the intelligence community’s eff ort to improve its tradecraft through online digital debate programming. Such diff erence is especially evident in light of the EPA’s commitment to extend debates to public realms, with the attendant possible benefits unpacked by Jane Munksgaard and Damien Pfister: 110 Rhetoric and Public Affairs (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; style=&amp;#34;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)Having a (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; %)public (% style=&amp;#34;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)debater argue against (%%)their (% style=&amp;#34;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)convictions(%%),(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:6.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&amp;#34; %) or confess their indecision on a subject and subsequent embrace of argument as a way to seek clarity, (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; style=&amp;#34;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)could shake (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; %)up (% style=&amp;#34;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)the prevailing view of debate as a war of words.

Although Gaonkar isolates rhetoric of science as a main target of this critique, his choice of subject matter Switch-Side Debating Meets Demand-Driven Rhetoric of Science 111 positions him to toggle back and forth between specific engagement with rhetoric of science scholarship and discussion of broader themes touching on the metatheoretical controversy over rhetoric’s proper scope as a field of inquiry (the so-called big vs. little rhetoric dispute).73 Gaonkar’s familiar refrain in both contexts is a warning about the dangers of “universalizing” or “globalizing” rhetorical inquiry, especially in attempts that “stretch” the classical Greek rhetorical vocabulary into a hermeneutic metadiscourse, one pressed into service as a master key for interpretation of any and all types of communicative artifacts. In other words, Gaonkar warns against the dangers of rhetoricians pursuing what might be called supply-side epistemology, rhetoric’s project of pushing for greater disciplinary relevance by attempting to extend its reach into far-flung areas of inquiry such as the hard sciences. Yet this essay highlights how rhetorical scholarship’s relevance can be credibly established by outsiders, who seek access to the creative energy flowing from the classical Greek rhetorical lexicon in its native mode, that is, as a tool of invention designed to spur and hone rhetorical performance. Analysis of the intelligence community and EPA debating initiatives shows how this is the case, with government agencies calling for assistance to animate rhetorical processes such as dissoi logoi (debating different sides) and synerchesthe (the performative task of coming together deliberately for the purpose of joint inquiry, collective choice-making, and renewal of communicative bonds).74 Th is demand-driven epistemology is diff erent in kind from the globalization project so roundly criticized by Gaonkar. Rather than rhetoric venturing out from its own academic home to proselytize about its epistemological universality for all knowers, instead here we have actors not formally trained in the rhetorical tradition articulating how their own deliberative objectives call for incorporation of rhetorical practice and even recruitment of “strategically located allies”75 to assist in the process. Since the productivist content in the classical Greek vocabulary serves as a critical resource for joint collaboration in this regard, demand-driven rhetoric of science turns Gaonkar’s original critique on its head. In fairness to Gaonkar, it should be stipulated that his 1993 intervention challenged the way rhetoric of science had been done to date, not the universe of ways rhetoric of science might be done in the future. And to his partial credit, Gaonkar did acknowledge the promise of a performance-oriented rhetoric of science, especially one informed by classical thinkers other than Aristotle.76 In his Ph.D. dissertation on “Aspects of Sophistic Pedagogy,” Gaonkar documents how the (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; %)ancient (% style=&amp;#34;background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow&amp;#34; %)sophists were (%%)“the greatest (% style=&amp;#34;background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)champions(%%)”(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&amp;#34; %) 112 Rhetoric and Public Affairs (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; style=&amp;#34;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)of “socially useful” science(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:6.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt&amp;#34; %),77 and also how the sophists essentially practiced the art of rhetoric in a translational, performative register: Th e sophists could not blithely go about their business of making science useful, while science itself stood still due to lack of communal support and recognition. Besides, sophistic pedagogy was becoming increasingly dependent on the findings of contemporary speculation in philosophy and science. Take for instance, the eminently practical art of rhetoric. As taught by the best of the sophists, (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; style=&amp;#34;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)it was not simply a handbook (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; %)of recipes which (% style=&amp;#34;background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)anyone could (%%)mechanically (% style=&amp;#34;background: yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)employ to(% style=&amp;#34;font-size: 6.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %) (% style=&amp;#34;font-size:6.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&amp;#34; %)his (% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; style=&amp;#34;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)advantage(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:6.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&amp;#34; %).

Arguments are formally and functionally different from rhythmic patterns, situational constraints, levels of vocabulary, and the like-all features of rhetoric.

(% class=&amp;#34;StyleBoldUnderline&amp;#34; %)Many intercollegiate debate propositions call for the &amp;#34;federal government&amp;#34; to adopt a certain policy.

The bureau of Indian Affairs or the Environmental Protection Agency) to cam&amp;#39; out its policy, and the debate moved on to other issues. However, sometimes other terms in the proposition (for instance, Indian Country) become critical issues of the debate.

====Their K of democratic deliberation rests on the assumptions they criticize—for instance, the case for structural antagonism or the impossibility of consensus presupposes that rational argument is possible.  Our framework energizes the arena for interdependent reasoning—we do this by defending consensus is possible, but fallible.  This means using the resolution to affirm the debate-to-be-had that is this topic—the point is not to settle which way of debating is objectively best, but to use provisional rules for reciprocal clash—that process of dialogism uniquely activates critical thinking and reflexivity====
Knops 2007 – DPhil, Lecturer, Department of Political Science and International Studies, University of Birmingham, UK (March, Andrew, Journal of Political Philosophy, 15.1, &amp;#34;Debate: Agonism as Deliberation – On Mouffe~’s Theory of Democracy&amp;#34;, Wiley Online)

THE arguments advanced in Chantal Mouffe~’s The Democratic Paradox represent a sustained attack on deliberative 
AND
show how Mouffe~’s model may be seen as coherent within a deliberative framework.
I. MOUFFE~’S RELIANCE ON CONSENSUS
The first point to make about Mouffe~’s argument in The Democratic Paradox is that it 
AND
through rational argument. This is precisely what she criticises deliberative theorists for.
Of course, the content of the model for which Mouffe seeks rational acceptance is 
AND
be left as merely the interplay of differences within this domain of power.
Firstly, Mouffe argues that there should be common adherence to – consensus on – 
AND
to some form of rational argument akin to that deployed by deliberative theorists.
Although less clear, it is also apparent that Mouffe requires all participants in her 
AND
right to defend them, and fall short of ~’annihilation~’ or violence.
However, Mouffe adds a further qualification to the ~’free-play~’ of differences 
AND
reaching collective decisions through a procedure for rational discussion that deliberative theorists support.
An insistence on the need to distinguish and combat relations of subordination is necessary for 
AND
in other words, on any aspect of the subject matter of politics.
From all this we can conclude that Mouffe~’s alternative is firstly grounded in a universal 
AND
are not to reproduce the relations of subordination that Mouffe wishes to combat.
So it would seem that Mouffe~’s own agonistic alternative to deliberative democracy, designed to 
AND
deliberative democracy that she has criticised. I will explore the second option.
II. REHABILITATION OF DELIBERATIVE DEMOCRACY
Mouffe~’s objection to deliberative democracy is that it is founded on a notion of rational 
AND
be extended to deal with Mouffe~’s second line of criticism from linguistic deconstruction.
A. Wittgenstein
Mouffe explicitly identifies two sources on whose interpretation of Wittgenstein she draws in criticising deliberative democracy. They are Hannah Pitkin, in her work Wittgenstein and Justice, and James Tully.4 To do justice to Mouffe~’s argument, I will stick to the version of Wittgenstein advanced by these two commentators.
In arguing against the possibility of rational consensus, Mouffe uses three key Wittgenstinian concepts
AND
reconcile such notions with the possibility of a rational consensus reached through deliberation.
As Pitkin explains, Wittgenstein~’s version of language suggests that we learn terms through practice
AND
, of course, involve them making mistakes, which are then corrected.
Because words are developed 

====~~finished at the top of the 2nc~~====
through repeated use in this way, they rarely have settled meanings. By applying 
AND
case of applying a clear-cut rule to a definite situation.8
Because words develop through practices and their use in particular situations, and in many 
AND
only discover these by investigating particular practices of use in specific cases.11
However, Wittgenstein concedes that there must be some kind of regularity to our use 
AND
or all of us. Cavell sums this up well when he says:
We learn and teach words in certain contexts, and then we are expected, 
AND
– all the whirl of organism Wittgenstein calls ~’forms of life~’.12
These forms of life are not so much constituted by, but constitute, language. They serve as its ~’ground~’. Therefore, although the process of explaining a term, and of reasoning in language, may continue up to a point, it will always come to an end and have to confront simple agreement in activity, ways of going on, or forms of life.
Mouffe sees this account as ruling out the possibility of rational consensus. Following Tully
AND
it to be far too varied and idiosyncratic for such an account.14
Yet I would like to argue that Wittgenstein~’s theory as characterised above does not rule 
AND
hence to arrive as closely as possible to the notion of an absolute.
The process that Habermas calls ~’practical discourse~’18 and the process that Wittgenstein calls ~’
AND
repairs the assumption that we do use these words in similar ways.22
But this dialogical sharing of reasons is nothing more than Wittgenstein~’s concept of explanation and 
AND
can in itself be seen as the process of development of language use.
Before moving on, we should note an important feature of this process: any 
AND
understanding developed through reason, though partial, fallible and grounded in practice.
Deliberative democracy, then, is compatible with a Wittgensteinian theory of language, which 
AND
deliberation against the second, deconstructionist, set of arguments that Mouffe musters.
B. Deconstruction
Mouffe also uses Derrida~’s notions of differance and the ~’constitutive other~’25 to argue that any form of consensus must always be partial and biased against a group that it excludes, while necessarily unstable as it contains the traces of this power. This precludes the very idea of a consensus that is neutral because it is reached on rational grounds.26
However, using our enhanced understanding of deliberation we can see how such an argument 
AND
, and allowing for collective agreement and collective action to change oppressive practices.
Another way of characterising this process is to see it as the activity of questioning
AND
-for-tat~’ exchange in which ex-oppressors become the oppressed.
The fallibilistic and partial nature of deliberation or explanation also secures it against Mouffe~’s use 
AND
, nor does it rule out the possibility of rational consensus through deliberation.
Finally amongst Mouffe~’s deconstructionist arguments against deliberation we have her use of Lacan. She deploy~’s Lacan~’s notion of the ~’master signifier~’29– a set of unquestioned assumptions that form the frame for any discourse – to illustrate that all discourses must be conditioned by authority. This gives her yet another reason why the idea of neutral rational consensus, free from power, is conceptually flawed (DP, pp. 137–8).
The defeasibility of deliberation, and its privileging of questions, again serves to turn 
AND
such an ideal their critical projects founder, just as much as deliberation~’s.
III. CONCLUSION
Mouffe believes in a consensus that distinguishes and opposes oppressive uses of power, seeing 
AND
are in fact mutually dependent aspects of a solution to the same problem.

====Knowledge from personal experience reifies privilege by assuming someone can have epistemic entitlement to see reality better than us====
Parrish ~’11 Jesse, student commenter on Victor Reppert~’s blog Dangerous Idea, devoted to exploring biases in argumentation, August http://dangerousidea.blogspot.com/2011/08/sltf.html

I think that whenever we are looking to calibrate the effect of evidence on probability

====Side switching does not equate to speaking from nowhere or divesting yourself of social background—our argument is that if your only exposure to the topic is finding ways to critique or avoid it, then you become solely capable of preaching to the choir.

Lately, proponents of immigration reform have been optimistic about the progress of bipartisan bills 
AND
.¶ Whether Congress can maintain momentum on the issue remains to be seen.

Plan ignites a highly controversial federalism debate
Kay, 12 - Cornell Community and Regional Development Institute (CaRDI) (David, “Energy Federalism: Who Decides?” July, cardi.cornell.edu/cals/devsoc/outreach/cardi/programs/loader.cfm?csModule=security/getfileandPageID=1071714

Questions about energy production and consumption are acquiring renewed urgency in the 21 st Century
AND
of debate about energy federalism are being cinched into an increasingly dense tangle.

Top of the Agenda and PC key
Shifter 12/27 Michael is the President of Inter-American Dialogue. “Will Obama Kick the Can Down the Road?” 2012, http://www.thedialogue.org/page.cfm?pageID=32andpubID=3186

&amp;#34;Comprehensive immigration reform will see expansion of skilled labor visas,&amp;#34; predicted B. 
AND

Key to China relations and growth

To frame the importance of this discussion and the topics that must be met, Siegal used the analogy of “the U.S. and China having their hands around each other’s necks and we’re both going over the waterfall.” After that comment a man in the audience then suggested that in that case both countries would have to look to the other for help and teamwork would be the only way to survive.
That theme resonated from coast to coast. At the University of California-Berkeley
AND
the imperative for Americans is to learn to get along with the Chinese.
 “We must ~-~- we don&amp;#39;t have a choice. The crises that threaten the human race, like weapons of mass destruction in the hands of terrorist groups, global warming, none of the issues will get resolved unless we work with China, Brazil, India and of course Europe and other countries. Really the central axis that holds the whole thing together is the U.S. and China,&amp;#34; Rittenberg said.

We may, however, notice that this Court in State of U.P. and Others v. M/s. Hindustan Aluminium Corpn. and others AIR 1979 SC 1459 stated the law thus:
&amp;#34;It appears that a distinction between regulation and restriction or prohibition has always been

Variety of ‘restrictions’
The term ‘restriction’, defined so broadly, embraces any number of familiar concepts
AND
of a formal model, for which any distinctions among them are irrelevant.

And, neg ground—questionable restrictions affs are terminally skewed because no counterplans and few DAs apply—that’s the core of our prep.

From the utility&amp;#39;s point of view, a growing wave of rooftop PV projects is

The correlation between economic growth and energy costs is high and negative; when energy costs go up, productivity takes a nosedive. In these extraordinary times, arguably the top priority must be to ensure that a secular financial downturn doesn&amp;#39;t turn into a worldwide structural depression. If that happens, both the economy and the environment will be losers.

Two neatly opposed scenarios for the future of the world order illustrate the range of

The United States Federal Government should expropriate solar power production from the private domain and assert direct oversight control over both the solar power production sector and its market competitors for the purpose of local solar, placing the industry under direct management by independent boards of unionized industrial workers, collectively and democratically accountable to the majority of workers in the industry.
It’s competitive—they decrease restrictions on solar production—we maximize them to infinity and say state expropriation good

Global poverty declining faster than ever—best new metrics
McVeigh 3/16/2013 – chief reporter for the Observer (Tracy, Guardian, “World poverty is shrinking rapidly, new index reveals”, http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2013/mar/17/aid-trade-reduce-acute-poverty)

Some of the poorest people in the world are becoming significantly less poor, according to a groundbreaking academic study which has taken a new approach to measuring deprivation. The report, by Oxford University&amp;#39;s poverty and human development initiative, predicts that countries among the most impoverished in the world could see acute poverty eradicated within 20 years if they continue at present rates.
It identifies &amp;#34;star performer&amp;#34; nations such as Rwanda, Nepal and Bangladesh as places where deprivation could disappear within the lifetime of present generations. Close on their heels with reductions in poverty levels were Ghana, Tanzania, Cambodia and Bolivia.
The study comes after the UN&amp;#39;s latest development report published last week which stated that 
AND
conditions and prospects of so many people changed so dramatically and so fast.&amp;#34;
The brighter global picture is the result of international and national aid and development projects 
AND
without taking into account other factors – health, education and living standards.
The study of the world&amp;#39;s poorest one billion people uses a new measure, the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI), which was just updated in the 2013 UN report. It includes ten indicators to calculate poverty – nutrition, child mortality, years of schooling and attendance, cooking fuel, water, sanitation, electricity assets and a covered floor.
The initiative hopes insights from the MPI will incentivise international donors and governments to help the poorest by allowing the results to be measured. The academics believe old methods of looking at income levels – such as those living on $1.25 a day or less – ignores other deprivations in, for example, nutrition, health and sanitation.
The system was developed in 2010 by the institute&amp;#39;s director, Dr Sabina Alkire, and Dr Maria Emma Santos. Dr Alkire said: &amp;#34;As poor people worldwide have said, poverty is more than money – it is ill health, it is food insecurity, it is not having work, or experiencing violence and humiliation, or not having health care, electricity, or good housing.

One of the most pervasive findings in social science, although it is seldom codified this way, is how suggestible people are. Numerous studies in behavioral economics have found that the same underlying bet elicits very different take-up rates when framed as a wager versus as insurance. Even worse, humans are susceptible to obviously exogenous influence.
One oft-repeated test that yields consistent results is to ask a group in 
AND
an arbitrary figure, lead to markedly higher average estimates on the form.
The question du jour is why does the US have such a phobia regarding nationalization. Per the lead-in, I suspect it has a great deal more to do with social conditioning than a case-by-case assessment of possible gains and losses.
While the initial (correct) reflex is that undue government interference in a well-functioning private sector is not a good idea, the industries in question (financial services and automobiles) have top players that are now abject failures on taxpayer life support. These companies have been exempted from market discipline (aka bankruptcy) thanks to state intervention.
The very fact that they operated with minimal government oversight, drove themselves to the verge of bankruptcy, and managed to make themselves so essential that they cannot be permitted to collapse says they cannot be left in their former hands (incumbent management is either colossal incompetent, amazingly corrupt and scheming, or both). 
But unlike the UK, and Sweden during its early 1990s crisis (widely touted 
AND
far more damage and has gotten much bigger handouts and no unpleasant questions).
I saw a simpleminded but compelling explanation for this phenomenon: Europeans consume more government 
AND
job, the citizenry is willing to deploy tax dollars to these ends. 
That is a long-winded way of saying that government inefficiency and incompetence is

rescues but hope to avoid the demands that should properly go with them.

His argument against central economic planning, then, is that it is impossible because knowledge cannot be totalized. Total knowledge, complete knowledge, is unobtainable. Foucault specifies the idea that limits on knowledge are limits on government as the economic rationality of liberalism. Liberalism extends the problem of economic knowledge into a more fundamental incompatibility between ³the non-totalizable multiplicity of economicsubjects of interest and the totalizing unity of the juridical sovereign.´
Insisting that the totality of economic processes cannot be known, liberal economics renders a

As a breakup of the eurozone ~-~- a once seemingly impossible scenario ~-~- becomes increasingly likely, economists are starting to sketch out what a post-euro world would look like. Many are warning that if political leaders don&amp;#39;t change course, a breakup of the eurozone would plunge the United States and the rest of the world into a slowdown and possibly another recession. 
&amp;#34;If Europe turns out badly, it&amp;#39;s much more likely we&amp;#39;ll go into recession,&amp;#34; said Michael Spence, a Nobel Prize-winning economist at the New York University Stern School of Business. &amp;#34;If you take a big chunk like Europe and turn it down, it would probably bring everybody else down, including us.&amp;#34;
If the eurozone dissolves, the European banking system would likely collapse, economists said, plunging the continent into recession, which would keep European consumers from buying. Decreased demand from the continent, which represents about 20 percent of the global economy, would hurt both the United States and emerging countries, who depend on European banks not just for demand, but also for funding.
The risk of a eurozone breakup has increased dramatically over the past couple of weeks, as countries have faced increasing difficulty selling their debt. Interest rates on sovereign bonds issued by eurozone countries have spiked. The interest rate on 10-year Italian sovereign bonds rose to 7.28 percent Monday, nearly hitting a Nov. 9 euro-era high that was only eased afterward by limited bond purchases by the European Central Bank. 
The interest rate on 10-year Spanish sovereign bonds rose to 6.58 percent Monday, near the euro-era high reached on Nov. 17. Interest rates on the 10-year bonds of more fiscally sound countries, such as France and Belgium, spiked to 3.58 percent and 5.59 percent respectively on Monday, as the contagion of higher borrowing costs spread to across the eurozone, regardless of their economic fundamentals. 
If European leaders don&amp;#39;t agree to take bold economic measures for more fiscal integration ~-~- including allowing the European Central Bank to become the lender of last resort ~-~- the eurozone could start to unravel, said Simon Tilford, chief economist of the Center for European Reform in London.

She was also Head of the Policy Unit at the Institute of Directors (IoD) between 1995 and 2003, before which she was the Economics Editor at ITN, Chief Economist at Mitsubishi Bank and Chief UK Economist at Lehman Brothers (Ruth, “Electricity Costs: The folly of windpower” January, http://www.civitas.org.uk/economy/electricitycosts2012.pdf

These extra costs damage competitiveness and undermine viability, especially high energy users. They risk driving industry to migrate overseas, along with their CO2 emissions, thus having zero net impact on global emissions totals. Indeed such migration could increase global CO2 emissions if the recipient country is less energy efficient than the UK. Suffice to say the supply of competitively-priced, secure and reliable sources of electricity is vital to modern industry.

Increasing solar penetration causes grid instability – independently jacks up manufacturing costs – turns their competitiveness args
St. John, 9 – reporter and analyst for Greentech Media covering the green technology space, with a particular focus on smart grid, smart buildings, energy efficiency, demand response, energy storage, green IT, renewable energy and technology to integrate distributed, intermittent green energy into the grid (Jeff, “Will Solar Crash the Smart Grid?” Green Tech Media, 11/2, 
http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/the-great-solar-smart-grid-challenge)

The proliferation of solar panels will effectively transform commercial districts and neighborhoods into small, localized power plants. While that will allow utilities to cut back on coal, the unpredictable, varying nature of solar power will force grid operators to dispatch or throttle power rapidly. Solar-balancing smart grid systems now confined to pilot projects will need to become common features pretty soon.
&amp;#34;That future is coming, and it&amp;#39;s coming a lot faster than I think many people are aware of,&amp;#34; said Chris Baker, CIO of utility San Diego Gas and Electric. (Execs from SDGandE and other utilities will speak on this and other topics at Greentech Media&amp;#39;s The Networked Grid conference in San Francisco on Nov. 4.)
SDGandE has about 6,600 customers with solar rooftops, he said. While that&amp;#39;s growing by about 60 customers a month, it still only represents about 50 megawatts of generation, or about 1 percent of the utility&amp;#39;s 5,000-megawatt total load. The utility can&amp;#39;t monitor or control it, but there isn&amp;#39;t enough of it to matter that much, he said — yet (see Having Solar Energy System Trouble? Don&amp;#39;t Call Your Utilities). 
But what happens when 20 percent or more of the homes in a neighborhood go solar and a cloud passes overhead? That changes a neighborhood of solar power producers to utility power customers in a matter of minutes – and grids built to deliver power one way at constant voltages and frequencies have trouble accommodating that two-way, intermittent flow.
Too much solar power, and local grid voltage could rise, causing potential problems for motors, lights and other equipment. Too little, and voltage can sag. That may only flicker light bulbs at home, but it can lead to million-dollar work stoppages for customers like semiconductor manufacturers and server farms that need clean power at a near-to-constant voltage and frequency.


Transmission investments are increasing now

http://in.reuters.com/article/2013/02/06/utilities-eei-idINL1N0B6I7C20130206)

U.S. investor-owned utilities will invest about $85 billion annually this year and next to keep the power grid reliable and integrate new natural gas plants while cleaning up older coal units, the president of the industry&amp;#39;s trade group told Reuters on Wednesday.
&amp;#34;Our industry is the most capital-intensive industry in the United States and projects to spend an average of about $85 billion a year on capital expenditures through 2014,&amp;#34; said Tom Kuhn, president of the Edison Electric Institute.
He told Reuters those investment levels are about double what they were 10 years ago.
Of the $85 billion, Kuhn said power companies would spend about $50 billion on new generation and upgrades, $25 billion on distribution to consumers and $10 billion on transmission between power plants and distribution networks

Coincident with the construction of the transmission and RE plants must be the addition of backup power supplies, n4 firm demand-response capacity, or both.

2nc solves emissions

The CP’s performance standard substantially reduces carbon emissions and boosts a mix of investments in energy efficiency and renewables
Lashof, 12 – director of the climate and clean air program at the Natural Resources Defense Council (Daniel, “Closing the Power Plant Carbon Pollution Loophole: Smart Ways the Clean Air Act Can Clean Up America’s Biggest Climate Polluters” December, http://www.nrdc.org/air/pollution-standards/files/pollution-standards-report.pdf)

NRDC has conducted an analysis of how CO2 pollution standards for existing fossil fuel–
AND
needs to avoid billions of dollars of stranded investment in obsolete power plants. 

The CP is the best of all worlds – it achieves emissions reductions through a mix of consumer electricity efficiency, generation efficiency, co-firing, and new renewables – the mix reduces emissions more than any one technology can achieve on its own
Lashof, 12 – director of the climate and clean air program at the Natural Resources Defense Council (Daniel, “Closing the Power Plant Carbon Pollution Loophole: Smart Ways the Clean Air Act Can Clean Up America’s Biggest Climate Polluters” December, http://www.nrdc.org/air/pollution-standards/files/pollution-standards-report.pdf)

The most important existing fleet characteristics and emission control opportunities are these:
n The mix of fossil fuel–fired steam generators and natural gas combined-cycle plants differs from state to state, varying from almost entirely coal to almost entirely natural gas.
n Compared with other categories of industrial sources, the power plant fleet is operated to a unique extent as an integrated system on a state or regional basis, with interdependent management decisions on when to operate, build, upgrade, and retire individual units.
n Depending on their type and starting point, existing generating units can reduce their own CO2 emission rates by improving generation efficiency (improving heat rates) or by switching to or co-firing with lower-emitting fuels (e.g., natural gas or biomass).
n Covered units within a state or group of states can reduce their average emission rates through additional tools, including dispatch shifts (e.g., running lower-emitting plants more and higher-emitting plants less).
n Covered units can reduce their emissions by increasing generation from renewable and other non-emitting plants.
n Covered units can reduce their emissions by increasing end-use electrical energy efficiency.
These system-wide compliance options can allow more substantial emission reductions—at lower overall cost—than the restricted set of measures that individual units can take on their own.

2nc perm do both

The CP incentivizes competition between renewables – it limits overall price increases because it doesn’t favor one over the other
Apt, 9  *Distinguished Service Professor of Engineering and Public Policy and Associate Research Professor, Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon University (Jay, Congressional Testimony, Hearing on The American Clean Energy Security Act of 2009, 4/23, http://carboncontrolnews.com/hearing_docs/ccn04232009_apt.pdf

I commend you for searching for ways to reach the goals of reducing greenhouse gas 
AND

I have two recommendations that I hope you will consider: 
Focus on reducing carbon dioxide rather than singling out renewables as the answer. There are significant savings from letting all technologies compete in satisfying the goals of lowering greenhouse gas emissions, increasing energy security, and improving sustainability, ensuring that energy prices are not so high that they derail the economy. 

The permutation destroys efficiency incentives
Borenstein, 12 - Severin Borenstein is E. T. Grether Professor of Business Economics and Public Policy, Haas School of Business, University of California, Berkeley, California. He is a Co-Director of the Energy Institute at Haas, and Director of the University of California Energy Institute (“The Private and Public Economics of Renewable Electricity Generation” Journal of Economic Perspectives—Volume 26, Number 1—Winter 2012—Pages 67–92 http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.26.1.67)

First, subsidizing green power for reducing pollution (relative to some counterfactual) is

United States has raised the cost of regulation by at least 6 percent.

That’s key to the entire success of the CP

The fact that energy efficiency counts as compliance is crucial to the economics of NRDC’s proposal. If avoided carbon counts toward reducing average fleet emissions, then every utility, in every state and region, has access to inexpensive compliance measures. Efficiency is ubiquitous and in almost every case cheaper than new power sources. This is something utilities are already catching on to, as evidenced by the surge in efficiency investments over the last few years:
Remember: Efficiency saves ratepayers money. According to modeling of the NRDC proposal done by ICF International, by complying through efficiency measures, utilities could achieve the proposed carbon standards while slightly reducing power bills. And every dollar not spent on power is a dollar of annual economic stimulus.

solves climate leadership

The CP is the best internal link to climate leadership – it sends a more powerful signal than the aff and gets other countries on board for emissions reductions
Chipman, 12 (Kim, “U.S. Could Cut Power Plant Pollution 26%, NRDC Says” Business Week, 12/4, http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-12-04/u-dot-s-dot-could-cut-power-plant-pollution-26-percent-nrdc-says)

President Barack Obama could cut greenhouse-gas emissions from U.S. power 
AND
S. can reduce emissions and be on track for an international agreement.”


AT: Regulations increase prices

The CP involves a range of flexible enforcement mechanisms that allows utilities to achieve emissions reductions at very low cost – the aff arguments assume inflexible regulation
Lashof, 12 – director of the climate and clean air program at the Natural Resources Defense Council (Daniel, “Closing the Power Plant Carbon Pollution Loophole: Smart Ways the Clean Air Act Can Clean Up America’s Biggest Climate Polluters” December, http://www.nrdc.org/air/pollution-standards/files/pollution-standards-report.pdf)

Third, the recommended program gives each source several ways to comply. 
n A source may comply by meeting the emission rate standard on its own. 
n A set of sources may comply by averaging their emission rates. For example, a coal plant may average with a gas plant, such that their total emissions divided by their combined electricity output meets the applicable state standard. 
n A source may comply by acquiring qualifying credits derived from low- or zero-emitting electricity generation. For example, an NGCC plant would earn credits reflecting the difference between the required state fleet average standard and its emissions per megawatt-hour. A wind plant would earn larger per-MWh credits, reflecting the difference between the state standard and its zero-emission rate. 
n Finally, a source may comply by acquiring qualifying energy efficiency credits, reflecting incremental reductions in power demand (sometimes called “negawatt-hours”), which earn credits at the same rate as other zero-emission sources listed above.
The EPA emission guideline document would need to specify the rules and protocols for these compliance options. Because the compliance responsibility remains with the sources in the regulated category, and because all of the eligible compliance measures reduce or avoid emissions from covered sources in that category, these compliance options are fully compatible with the definition of a standard of performance. 39
The recommended program structure allows, but does not require, states to reach agreements to allow sources in more than one state to average their emissions, or to use compliance credits generated in another state.
Building these types of emission reduction options into the emission guideline for compliance serves several important functions:
n It expands the range of compliance techniques available to each covered unit. 
n It provides an incentive for early action because measures that reduce emission rates any time after the end of the baseline period automatically count toward compliance. 
n It taps the most economically efficient means of reducing emissions, including energy efficiency and non-fossil supply options.
n It reduces the overall system cost of achieving any specified percentage improvement in sources’ emission rates, thus allowing achievement of the greatest possible pollution reduction within any given cost constraints.
n It equalizes the marginal cost of emission reductions for owners and operators of different types of plants within a state and eliminates the need for different standards for different types of power plants, given the ability to use emissions averaging and/or emission reduction credits, rather than meeting the standard on site.
Whether a standard of performance set at a particular level is achievable at a reasonable 
AND
the impact on the integrated system of electric generating units within a state.

Economic savings from this approach are substantially greater than the costs and it won’t increase electricity prices
Lashof, 12 – director of the climate and clean air program at the Natural Resources Defense Council (Daniel, “Closing the Power Plant Carbon Pollution Loophole: Smart Ways the Clean Air Act Can Clean Up America’s Biggest Climate Polluters” December, http://www.nrdc.org/air/pollution-standards/files/pollution-standards-report.pdf)

NRDC’s recommended CO2 performance standards will achieve considerable emission reductions through 2020 with manageable costs 
AND
capacity, and an increased market share for lower-emitting generation sources.
The value of societal benefits could reach $60 billion in 2020, as much

, asthma attacks, hospital visits, respiratory symptoms, and lost workdays.
The recommended approach will lower wholesale electricity costs. NRDC’s analysis indicates that, under the recommended approach, wholesale power prices would be 4 percent lower than under the Reference Case in 2020. Meanwhile, energy efficiency improvements in households and businesses would reduce electricity consumption, lowering electricity bills and emissions at the same time.

The energy efficiency portion of the CP will net lower electricity prices

What is solar energy? What are the differences in different types of energy technology in existence today?
Solar energy, quite simply, is energy that comes from the sun. (Simple.) But there are now many types of solar energy technology focused on making use of that energy and turning it into usable electricity or heat (or both).
The scale of energy generation ranges from the home water heater to serving 100,000+ homes. Below is an outline of the many solar energy forms, starting with hybrid solar power, since it is the least understood and publicized.

Active versus Passive Solar Energy. “Active” solar energy includes installing electrical or mechanical devices such as solar panels or thermal energy set-ups to create electricity, heat water, or heat space, as described above. These can be added to a home or building after it is already built, but are best when incorporated into new construction.
“Passive” solar involves recognizing the sun’s radiation properties to either increase the natural

And the solar energy tax credit includes eligibility for heating and cooling, not just power
HubPages, 2013 – a tax advice website (“Federal Solar Energy Investment Tax Credits for 2012, 2013” http://creditguide.hubpages.com/hub/Federal-Solar-Energy-Investment-Tax-Credits

Federal Solar Energy Investment Tax Credits
The solar energy tax credit began in 1978 and allowed you to claim a tax credit for solar energy purchases. It remained at the 15 percent credit until 1986 when it was reduced to 12 percent and was again reduced to 10 percent in 1988.
In 2005 the energy policy act was put in to place and allowed for a 30 percent tax credit of up to $2,000.00. This act was set to expire as of December 31, 2008 but received an 8 year extension. The $2,000.00 cap will also be lifted on solar purchases after December 31, 2008. So it may be a good time to consider using solar energy in your home.
AMT and Solar Energy Credits
Effective December 31st, 2008 alternative minimum tax (AMT) filers will be able to also apply for the solar investment tax credit as well. This credit was not previously available to AMT filers.
Qualifying Solar Equipment
To qualify for the solar energy investment tax credit you must use solar energy to generate electricity, heat, cool, or to provide light inside of a structure. Solar pool heating equipment does not qualify for this credit.

She has written for The Boston Globe, The New York Observer, and The San Antonio Express-News., she is a recent graduate of Harvard University, where she studied international economic history and the history of economic thought (Bonnie, “Eurozone Crisis Threatens Global Economy” http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/11/28/eurozone-crisis_n_1116977.html) Jacome 

As a breakup of the eurozone ~-~- a once seemingly impossible scenario ~-~- becomes increasingly likely, economists are starting to sketch out what a post-euro world would look like. Many are warning that if political leaders don&amp;#39;t change course, a breakup of the eurozone would plunge the United States and the rest of the world into a slowdown and possibly another recession. 
&amp;#34;If Europe turns out badly, it&amp;#39;s much more likely we&amp;#39;ll go into recession,&amp;#34; said Michael Spence, a Nobel Prize-winning economist at the New York University Stern School of Business. &amp;#34;If you take a big chunk like Europe and turn it down, it would probably bring everybody else down, including us.&amp;#34;
If the eurozone dissolves, the European banking system would likely collapse, economists said, plunging the continent into recession, which would keep European consumers from buying. Decreased demand from the continent, which represents about 20 percent of the global economy, would hurt both the United States and emerging countries, who depend on European banks not just for demand, but also for funding.
The risk of a eurozone breakup has increased dramatically over the past couple of weeks, as countries have faced increasing difficulty selling their debt. Interest rates on sovereign bonds issued by eurozone countries have spiked. The interest rate on 10-year Italian sovereign bonds rose to 7.28 percent Monday, nearly hitting a Nov. 9 euro-era high that was only eased afterward by limited bond purchases by the European Central Bank. 
The interest rate on 10-year Spanish sovereign bonds rose to 6.58 percent Monday, near the euro-era high reached on Nov. 17. Interest rates on the 10-year bonds of more fiscally sound countries, such as France and Belgium, spiked to 3.58 percent and 5.59 percent respectively on Monday, as the contagion of higher borrowing costs spread to across the eurozone, regardless of their economic fundamentals. 
If European leaders don&amp;#39;t agree to take bold economic measures for more fiscal integration ~-~- including allowing the European Central Bank to become the lender of last resort ~-~- the eurozone could start to unravel, said Simon Tilford, chief economist of the Center for European Reform in London. 
The eurozone&amp;#39;s future could be decided next week when leaders meet for a summit on 
AND
default and leave the eurozone, leading to its collapse, he said.

====Deliberation is the best alternative to activism because it requires continual testing that bolsters advocacy and inclusion—refusal of side switching leads to group polarization and isolation====
Talisse 2005 – philosophy professor at Vanderbilt (Robert, Philosophy %26 Social Criticism, 31.4, &amp;#34;Deliberativist responses to activist challenges&amp;#34;) *note: gendered language in this article refers to arguments made by two specific individuals in an article by Iris Young 

Nonetheless, the deliberativist conception of reasonableness differs from the activist~’s in at least one crucial respect. On the deliberativist view, a necessary condition for reasonableness is the willingness not only to offer justifications for one~’s own views and actions, but also to listen to criticisms, objections, and the justificatory reasons that can be given in favor of alternative proposals.
In light of this further stipulation, we may say that, on the deliberative 
AND
new considerations offered by one~’s fellow deliberators. Hence Gutmann and Thompson write:
Citizens who owe one another justifications for the laws that they seek to impose must 
AND
possibility of their revision or even rejection.16 (2000: 172)
That Young~’s activist is not reasonable in this sense is clear from the ways in 
AND
other citizens in support of the cause to which he is tenaciously committed.
The activist implicitly holds that there could be no reasoned objection to his views concerning 
AND
reasoning with those who disagree, and hence no need to be reasonable.
According to the deliberativist, this is the respect in which the activist is unreasonable
AND
as presented by Young~’s activist, is an unreasonable model of political engagement. 
The dialogical conception of reasonableness adopted by the deliberativist also provides a response to the 
AND
, he is engaged in the kind of adversarial politics the deliberativist rejects.
The argument thus far might appear to turn exclusively upon different conceptions of what reasonableness 
AND
deliberativist~’s demand for discussion can only obstruct justice; it is therefore irrational. 
It may seem that we have reached an impasse. However, there is a 
AND
be a self-selected and sympathetic group of like-minded activists.
Group polarization is a well-documented phenomenon that has ~’been found all over 
AND
of any individual member before the series of deliberations began~’ (ibid.).17 
The fact of group polarization is relevant to our discussion because the activist has proposed 
AND
of justice. Insofar as the activist denies this, he is unreasonable.

What is striking about much of the political discussion on the left today is its failure to engage this earlier tradition of argument. The left, particularly the campus left—by which I mean &amp;#34;progressive&amp;#34; faculty and student groups, often centered around labor solidarity organizations and campus Green affiliates—has become moralistic rather than politically serious. Some of its moralizing—about Chiapas, Palestine, and Iraq—continues the third worldism that plagued the New Left in its waning years. Some of it—about globalization and sweatshops— is new and in some ways promising (see my &amp;#34;Thinking About the Antisweatshop Movement,&amp;#34; Dissent, Fall 2001). But what characterizes much campus left discourse is a substitution of moral rhetoric about evil policies or institutions for a sober consideration of what might improve or replace them, how the improvement might be achieved, and what the likely costs, as well as the benefits, are of any reasonable strategy. One consequence of this tendency is a failure to worry about methods of securing political support through democratic means or to recognize the distinctive value of democracy itself. It is not that conspiratorial or antidemocratic means are promoted. On the contrary, the means employed tend to be preeminently democratic—petitions, demonstrations, marches, boycotts, corporate campaigns, vigorous public criticism. And it is not that political democracy is derided. Projects such as the Green Party engage with electoral politics, locally and nationally, in order to win public office and achieve political objectives. But what is absent is a sober reckoning with the preoccupations and opinions of the vast majority of Americans, who are not drawn to vocal denunciations of the International Monetary Fund and World Trade Organization and who do not believe that the discourse of &amp;#34;anti-imperialism&amp;#34; speaks to their lives. Equally absent is critical thinking about why citizens of liberal democratic states—including most workers and the poor—value liberal democracy and subscribe to what Jürgen Habermas has called &amp;#34;constitutional patriotism&amp;#34;: a patriotic identification with the democratic state because of the civil, political, and social rights it defends. Vicarious identifications with Subcommandante Marcos or starving Iraqi children allow left activists to express a genuine solidarity with the oppressed elsewhere that is surely legitimate in a globalizing age. But these symbolic avowals are not an effective way of contending for political influence or power in the society in which these activists live. The ease with which the campus left responded to September 11 by rehearsing an all too-familiar narrative of American militarism and imperialism is not simply disturbing. It is a sign of this left~’s alienation from the society in which it operates (the worst examples of this are statements of the Student Peace Action Coalition Network, which declare that &amp;#34;the United States Government is the world~’s greatest terror organization,&amp;#34; and suggest that &amp;#34;homicidal psychopaths of the United States Government&amp;#34; engineered the World Trade Center attacks as a pretext for imperialist aggression. See http://www.gospan.org). Many left activists seem more able to identify with (idealized versions of) Iraqi or Afghan civilians than with American citizens, whether these are the people who perished in the Twin Towers or the rest of us who legitimately fear that we might be next. This is not because of any &amp;#34;disloyalty.&amp;#34; Charges like that lack intellectual or political merit. It is because of a debilitating moralism; because it is easier to denounce wrong than to take real responsibility for correcting it, easier to locate and to oppose a remote evil than to address a proximate difficulty. The campus left  says what it thinks. But it exhibits little interest in how and why so many Americans think differently. The &amp;#34;peace&amp;#34; demonstrations organized across the country within a few days of the September 11 attacks—in which local Green Party activists often played a crucial role—were, whatever else they were, a sign of their organizers~’ lack of judgment and common sense. Although they often expressed genuine horror about the terrorism, they focused their energy not on the legitimate fear and outrage of American citizens but rather on the evils of the American government and its widely supported response to the terror. Hardly anyone was paying attention, but they alienated anyone who was. This was utterly predictable. And that is my point. The predictable consequences did not matter. What mattered was simply the expression of righteous indignation about what is wrong with the United States, as if September 11 hadn~’t really happened. Whatever one thinks about America~’s deficiencies, it must be acknowledged that a political praxis preoccupation with this is foolish and self-defeating. The other, more serious consequence of this moralizing tendency is the failure to think seriously about global politics. The campus left is rightly interested in the ills of global capitalism. But politically it seems limited to two options: expressions of &amp;#34;solidarity&amp;#34; with certain oppressed groups—Palestinians but not Syrians, Afghan civilians (though not those who welcome liberation from the Taliban), but not Bosnians or Kosovars or Rwandans—and automatic opposition to American foreign policy in the name of anti-imperialism. The economic discourse of the campus left is a universalist discourse of human needs and workers rights; but it is accompanied by a refusal to think in political terms about the realities of states, international institutions, violence, and power. This refusal is linked to a peculiar strain of pacifism, according to which any use of military force by the United States is viewed as aggression or militarism. case in point is a petition circulated on the campus of Indiana University within days of September 11. Drafted by the Bloomington Peace Coalition, it opposed what was then an imminent war in Afghanistan against al-Qaeda, and called for peace. It declared: &amp;#34;Retaliation will not lead to healing; rather it will harm innocent people and further the cycle of violence. Rather than engage in military aggression, those in authority should apprehend and charge those individuals believed to be directly responsible for the attacks and try them in a court of law in accordance with due process of international law.&amp;#34; This declaration was hardly unique. Similar statements were issued on college campuses across the country, by local student or faculty coalitions, the national Campus Greens, 9- 11peace.org, and the National Youth and Student Peace Coalition. As Global Exchange declared in its antiwar statement of September 11: &amp;#34;vengeance offers no relief. . . retaliation can never guarantee healing. . . and to meet violence with violence breeds more rage and more senseless deaths. Only love leads to peace with justice, while hate takes us toward war and injustice.&amp;#34; On this view military action of any kind is figured as &amp;#34;aggression&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;vengeance&amp;#34;; harm to innocents, whether substantial or marginal, intended or unintended, is absolutely proscribed; legality is treated as having its own force, independent of any means of enforcement; and, most revealingly, &amp;#34;healing&amp;#34; is treated as the principal goal of any legitimate response. None of these points withstands serious scrutiny. A military response to terrorist aggression is not in any obvious sense an act of aggression, unless any military response—or at least any U.S. military response—is simply defined as aggression. While any justifiable military response should certainly be governed by just-war principles, the criterion of absolute harm avoidance would rule out the possibility of any military response. It is virtually impossible either to &amp;#34;apprehend&amp;#34; and prosecute terrorists or to put an end to terrorist networks without the use of military force, for the &amp;#34;criminals&amp;#34; in question are not law-abiding citizens but mass murderers, and there are no police to &amp;#34;arrest&amp;#34; them. And, finally, while &amp;#34;healing&amp;#34; is surely a legitimate moral goal, it is not clear that it is a political goal. Justice, however, most assuredly is a political goal. The most notable thing about the Bloomington statement is its avoidance of political justice. Like many antiwar texts, it calls for &amp;#34;social justice abroad.&amp;#34; It supports redistributing wealth. But criminal and retributive justice, protection against terrorist violence, or the political enforcement of the minimal conditions of global civility—these are unmentioned. They are unmentioned because to broach them is to enter a terrain that the campus left is unwilling to enter—the terrain of violence, a realm of complex choices and dirty hands. This aversion to violence is understandable and in some ways laudable. America~’s use of violence has caused much harm in the world, from Southeast Asia to Central and Latin America to Africa. The so-called &amp;#34;Vietnam Syndrome&amp;#34; was the product of a real learning experience that should not be forgotten. In addition, the destructive capacities of modern warfare— which jeopardize the civilian/combatant distinction, and introduce the possibility of enormous ecological devastation—make war under any circumstances something to be feared. No civilized person should approach the topic of war with anything other than great trepidation. And yet the left~’s reflexive hostility toward violence in the international domain is strange. It is inconsistent with avowals of &amp;#34;materialism&amp;#34; and evocations of &amp;#34;struggle,&amp;#34; especially on the part of those many who are not pacifists; it is in tension with a commitment to human emancipation (is there no cause for which it is justifiable to fight?); and it is oblivious to the tradition of left thinking about ends and means. To compare the debates within the left about the two world wars or the Spanish Civil War with the predictable &amp;#34;anti-militarism&amp;#34; of today~’s campus left is to compare a discourse that was serious about political power with a discourse that is not. This unpragmatic approach has become a hallmark of post–cold war left commentary, from the Gulf War protests of 1991, to the denunciation of the 1999 U.S.-led NATO intervention in Kosovo, to the current post–September 11 antiwar movement. In each case protesters have raised serious questions about U.S. policy and its likely consequences, but in a strikingly ineffective way. They sound a few key themes: the broader context of grievances that supposedly explains why Saddam Hussein, or Slobodan Milosevic, or Osama bin Laden have done what they have done; the hypocrisy of official U.S. rhetoric, which denounces terrorism even though the U.S. government has often supported terrorism; the harm that will come to ordinary Iraqi or Serbian or Afghan citizens as a result of intervention; and the cycle of violence that is likely to ensue. These are important issues. But they typically are raised by left critics not to promote real debate about practical alternatives, but to avoid such a debate or to trump it. As a result, the most important political questions are simply not asked. It is assumed that U.S. military intervention is an act of &amp;#34;aggression,&amp;#34; but no consideration is given to the aggression to which intervention is a response. The status quo ante in Afghanistan is not, as peace activists would have it, peace, but rather terrorist violence abetted by a regime—the Taliban—that rose to power through brutality and repression. This requires us to ask a question that most &amp;#34;peace&amp;#34; activists would prefer not to ask: What should be done to respond to the violence of a Saddam Hussein, or a Milosevic, or a Taliban regime? What means are likely to stop violence and bring criminals to justice? Calls for diplomacy and international law are well intended and important; they implicate a decent and civilized ethic of global order. But they are also vague and empty, because they are not accompanied by any account of how diplomacy or international law can work effectively to address the problem at hand. The campus left offers no such account. To do so would require it to contemplate tragic choices in which moral goodness is of limited utility. Here what matters is not purity of intention but the intelligent exercise of power. Power is not a dirty word or an unfortunate feature of the world. It is the core of politics. Power is the ability to effect outcomes in the world. Politics, in large part, involves contests over the distribution and use of power. To accomplish anything in the political world, one must attend to the means that are necessary to bring it about. And to develop such means is to develop, and to exercise, power. To say this is not to say that power is beyond morality. It is to say that power is not reducible to morality. As writers such as Niccolo Machiavelli, Max Weber, Reinhold Niebuhr, and Hannah Arendt have taught, an unyielding concern with moral goodness undercuts political responsibility. The concern may be morally laudable, reflecting a kind of personal integrity, but it suffers from three fatal flaws: (1) It fails to see that the purity of one~’s intention does not ensure the achievement of what one intends. Abjuring violence or refusing to make common cause with morally  compromised parties may seem like the right thing; but if such tactics entail impotence, then it is hard to view them as serving any moral good beyond the clean conscience of their supporters; (2) it fails to see that in a world of real violence and injustice, moral purity is not simply a form of powerlessness; it is often a form of complicity in injustice. This is why, from the standpoint of politics—as opposed to religion—pacifism is always a potentially immoral stand. In categorically repudiating violence, it refuses in principle to oppose certain violent injustices with any effect; and (3) it fails to see that politics is as much about unintended consequences as it is about intentions; it is the effects of action, rather than the motives of action, that is most significant. Just as the alignment with &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; may engender impotence, it is often the pursuit of &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; that generates evil. This is the lesson of communism in the twentieth century: it is not enough that one~’s goals be sincere or idealistic; it is equally important, always, to ask about the effects of pursuing these goals and to judge these effects in pragmatic and historically contextualized ways. Moral absolutism inhibits this judgment. It alienates those who are not true believers. It promotes arrogance. And it undermines political effectiveness.

====No link to rules or predictability bad—our argument isn~’t rules-based in the sense they identify, it~’s a set of contestable guidelines for evaluating competitions.  Rejecting the topic because rules are oppressive doesn~’t solve and only a standard like the resolution is limited enough to enable preparation and testing but has enough internal complexity to solve their impact====

Such a play-space also opposes the notion that the only alternative to the

combination of constraint and possibility, limitation and unpredictability, discipline and spontaneity. 


====Their K of democratic deliberation rests on the assumptions they criticize—for instance, the case for structural antagonism or the impossibility of consensus presupposes that rational argument is possible.  Our framework energizes the arena for interdependent reasoning—we do this by defending consensus is possible, but fallible.  This means using the resolution to affirm the debate-to-be-had that is this topic—the point is not to settle which way of debating is objectively best, but to use provisional rules for reciprocal clash—that process of dialogism uniquely activates critical thinking and reflexivity====
Knops 2007 – DPhil, Lecturer, Department of Political Science and International Studies, University of Birmingham, UK (March, Andrew, Journal of Political Philosophy, 15.1, &amp;#34;Debate: Agonism as Deliberation – On Mouffe~’s Theory of Democracy&amp;#34;, Wiley Online)

I. MOUFFE~’S RELIANCE ON CONSENSUS
The first point to make about Mouffe~’s argument in The Democratic Paradox is that it 
AND
through rational argument. This is precisely what she criticises deliberative theorists for.
Of course, the content of the model for which Mouffe seeks rational acceptance is 
AND
be left as merely the interplay of differences within this domain of power.
Firstly, Mouffe argues that there should be common adherence to – consensus on – 
AND
to some form of rational argument akin to that deployed by deliberative theorists.
Although less clear, it is also apparent that Mouffe requires all participants in her 
AND
right to defend them, and fall short of ~’annihilation~’ or violence.
However, Mouffe adds a further qualification to the ~’free-play~’ of differences 
AND
reaching collective decisions through a procedure for rational discussion that deliberative theorists support.
An insistence on the need to distinguish and combat relations of subordination is necessary for 
AND
in other words, on any aspect of the subject matter of politics.
From all this we can conclude that Mouffe~’s alternative is firstly grounded in a universal 
AND
are not to reproduce the relations of subordination that Mouffe wishes to combat.
So it would seem that Mouffe~’s own agonistic alternative to deliberative democracy, designed to 
AND
deliberative democracy that she has criticised. I will explore the second option.
II. REHABILITATION OF DELIBERATIVE DEMOCRACY
Mouffe~’s objection to deliberative democracy is that it is founded on a notion of rational 
AND
be extended to deal with Mouffe~’s second line of criticism from linguistic deconstruction.
A. Wittgenstein
Mouffe explicitly identifies two sources on whose interpretation of Wittgenstein she draws in criticising deliberative democracy. They are Hannah Pitkin, in her work Wittgenstein and Justice, and James Tully.4 To do justice to Mouffe~’s argument, I will stick to the version of Wittgenstein advanced by these two commentators.
In arguing against the possibility of rational consensus, Mouffe uses three key Wittgenstinian concepts
AND
reconcile such notions with the possibility of a rational consensus reached through deliberation.
As Pitkin explains, Wittgenstein~’s version of language suggests that we learn terms through practice
AND
, of course, involve them making mistakes, which are then corrected.
Because words are developed through repeated use in this way, they rarely have settled 
AND
case of applying a clear-cut rule to a definite situation.8
Because words develop through practices and their use in particular situations, and in many 
AND
only discover these by investigating particular practices of use in specific cases.11
However, Wittgenstein concedes that there must be some kind of regularity to our use 
AND
or all of us. Cavell sums this up well when he says:
We learn and teach words in certain contexts, and then we are expected, 
AND
– all the whirl of organism Wittgenstein calls ~’forms of life~’.12
These forms of life are not so much constituted by, but constitute, language. They serve as its ~’ground~’. Therefore, although the process of explaining a term, and of reasoning in language, may continue up to a point, it will always come to an end and have to confront simple agreement in activity, ways of going on, or forms of life.
Mouffe sees this account as ruling out the possibility of rational consensus. Following Tully
AND
it to be far too varied and idiosyncratic for such an account.14
Yet I would like to argue that Wittgenstein~’s theory as characterised above does not rule 
AND
hence to arrive as closely as possible to the notion of an absolute.
The process that Habermas calls ~’practical discourse~’18 and the process that Wittgenstein calls ~’
AND
repairs the assumption that we do use these words in similar ways.22
But this dialogical sharing of reasons is nothing more than Wittgenstein~’s concept of explanation and 
AND
can in itself be seen as the process of development of language use.
Before moving on, we should note an important feature of this process: any 
AND
understanding developed through reason, though partial, fallible and grounded in practice.
Deliberative democracy, then, is compatible with a Wittgensteinian theory of language, which 
AND
deliberation against the second, deconstructionist, set of arguments that Mouffe musters.
B. Deconstruction


====Agonistic games require provisional rules like topicality—opposing the structures that enable clash is a reactive gesture hostile to struggle and competition====
Acampora 2002 – philosophy professor at Hunter College of the City University of New York (Fall, Christa Davis, International Studies in Philosophy, 34.3, &amp;#34;Of Dangerous Games and Dastardly Deeds&amp;#34;, http://christaacampora.com/uploads/news/id18/Dangerous%20Games.pdf)

The agonistic game is organized around the test of a specific quality the persons involved 
AND
able to compete. His study of slavish morality illuminates well that concern.
II. Dastardly Deeds
The so-called &amp;#34;Good Eris,&amp;#34; described in &amp;#34;Homer~’s Contest,&amp;#34; supposedly 
AND
between creative and destructive forms of contest and modes of competing within them. 
Nietzsche~’s On the Genealogy of Morals, a Streitschrift—a polemic, a writing 
AND
for Nietzsche, robs a being of its activity, of its life. 
In the second essay of the Genealogy, Nietzsche identifies the notion of conscience, 
AND
one with whom to struggle except himself, the man of bad conscience: 
impatiently lacerated, persecuted, gnawed at, assaulted, and maltreated himself; this 
AND
, joy, and terribleness had reached hitherto (GM II:16). 
Bad conscience functions in slavish morality as a means of self-flagellation, as 
AND
light, its salvation, its ultimate victory (GM III:28). 
Slavish morality, particularly in the form of Pauline Christianity, redirects the competitive drive 
AND
contest, the ethos of the agon is transformed in slavish morality. xiv
III. Dangerous Games 
Moralities effect contests in two ways: 1) they articulate a structure through which 
AND
that comes with what Nietzsche describes as &amp;#34;becoming what one is.&amp;#34; xvi
This, Nietzsche suggests, is what makes life worth living—it is what permits us to realize a certain human freedom to be active participants in shaping our own lives. xvii
Agonists, in the sense that Nietzsche has in mind, do not strive to 
AND
any meaning at all—the rules of the contest or game. Xviii


====~~MARKED HERE~~====


What makes this contest dangerous?xix	
To be engaged in the process of overcoming, as Nietzsche describes it, is 
AND
origin of ostracism as the mechanism for preserving the openness of contest. xx
Nietzsche claims agonistic institutions contribute to the health of individuals and the culture in which 
AND
but as the freedom of engagement in the process of creating ourselves. xxi 
IV. A Nietzschean ethos of agonism 
In a recent essay, Dana R. Villa examines the general thrust of arguments 
AND
consensus~’ but are contested every day in a dizzying array of venues. xxiii
Villa would commend them for this reminder, but he claims that &amp;#34;recent formulations of an agonistic politics ~~…~~ have tended to celebrate conflict, and individual and group expression, a bit too unselectively&amp;#34;. xxiv
He argues that &amp;#34;Nietzsche-inspired&amp;#34; agonists would do better to look to 
AND
&amp;#34;merely fighting&amp;#34;; so conceived, &amp;#34;politics is simply conflict&amp;#34;. xxv
Placing the expression of energies of the individual, multiplicities of selves, or groups 
AND
conception of agon and sketch the outlines of a productive ethos of agonism. 
Some competitions bring with them entitlements and rewards that are reserved for the sole winner
AND
the competitors are pitted against each other in an environment hostile to cooperation. 
We can also imagine competitions that are not zero-sum games, in which 
AND
is agon, which in its original use meant &amp;#34;gathering together.&amp;#34; xxvi
Practicing an agonistic model of competition could provide results of shared satisfaction and might enable us to transform competitions for fame and status that inform so much of our lives into competitions for meeting cooperatively and provisionally defined standards of aesthetic and intellectual excellence. xxvii
If we can revive the sense of agon as a gathering together that vivifies the 
AND
excellence than by comparison with some rigid and externally-imposed rule. xxviii
Agonism is not the only productive way of relating to each other, and we 
AND
, and norms that mark out the arenas in which such recreations occur. 
At his best, I think Nietzsche envisions a similar form for the agonistic life
AND
not only beyond good and evil but also beyond the cowardly and barbarous.
