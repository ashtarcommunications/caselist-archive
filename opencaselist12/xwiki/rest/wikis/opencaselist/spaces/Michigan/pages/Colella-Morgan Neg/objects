====Immigration reform package moving smoothly through congress now – Obama pressure and engagement is key to maintain momentum and prevent the GOP from smothering the bill====
 I-Hsien **Sherwood** (writer for the Latino Post) **March 21**, 2013 &amp;#34;Immigration Reform 2013 News: Delays Could Hinder Reform Bill, So Speed is Necessary&amp;#34; http://www.latinospost.com/articles/14995/20130321/immigration-reform-2013-news-delays-hinder-bill-speed-necessary.htm
Lately, proponents of immigration reform have been optimistic about the progress of bipartisan bills

However, in a democracy such as the United States, one could expect voices 
AND
anti-China rhetoric in an effort to derail a Chinese company~’s offer.
Another objection may be concern about losing businesses or jobs to China. Shenzhen-based BGI~’s US%24117.6 million acquisition of Complete Genomics, a DNA sequencing company, is a case in point.
According to an article in The New York Times, Illumina, a San Diego-based maker of genomics sequencing machines, hired lobbyists and led the choir to stir up opposition in Congress to the offer. Illumina, the report said, potentially had the most to lose from the acquisition because BGI might buy fewer of its products and even become a competitor. Nevertheless, CFIUS allowed the deal to go through.
Another obstacle to overseas acquisitions may be pork-barrel politics, with politicians using the Chinese application as a bargaining chip against another local project awaiting presidential approval. However, according to O~’Melveny %26 Myers, the law firm that provided legal counsel for the successful Complete Genomics acquisition, only two out of six major deals involving China since 2000 have been rejected by CFIUS.

No. 17558 of 2006~~  S.B. SINHA, J :

We may, however, notice that this Court in State of U.P. and Others v. M/s. Hindustan Aluminium Corpn. and others ~~AIR 1979 SC 1459~~ stated the law thus:
&amp;#34;It appears that a distinction between regulation and restriction or prohibition has always been

the word prohibiting or some such word, to bring out that effect.&amp;#34;

In order to distinguish an exchange restriction from a trade measure, the Fund chose not to give relevance to the purposes or the effects of the measure and to adopt, instead, a technical criterion that focuses on the method followed to design said measure.
An interpretation that considered the economic effects and purposes of the measures (taking into 
AND
balance of payments reasons would have fallen within the competence of the Fund.
After lengthy discussions, in 1960 the IMF Executive Board adopted Decision No. 1034-(60/27).46 This Decision clarified that the distinctive feature of a restriction on payments and transfers for current international transactions is &amp;#34;whether it involves a direct governmental limitation on the availability or use of exchange as such*.47 This is a limitation imposed directly on the use of currency in itself, for all purposes.

====Chinese investment increasing despite Ralls and CIFIUS====
Barrett, 3/1/13 (Raymond, Financial Times, &amp;#34;Ralls CFIUS block alters Sany~’s future investment strategy in US&amp;#34; http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/1ff1eb98-82b8-11e2-a3e3-00144feabdc0.html~~%23axzz2OvgILBlj

Chinese investors appear to have altered the way they will structure future investments in the US as a result of a White House decision to block the purchase of an Oregon wind farm by executives of Sany Group on national security grounds.
In an exclusive interview with PaRR, Wu Jialiang, chief executive officer of Ralls Corp and deputy general manager of Sany Group, said the company is continuing to make investments in the US despite contesting the decision of the inter-agency Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) forcing it to unwind the Oregon deal.
In particular, Wu said the Chinese industrial machinery manufacturer made a new wind farm investment of USD 80m in Colorado, which would use wind turbines manufactured by Sany.
Wu said the Colorado transaction was structured differently than the Oregon deal—the investment was held directly by US citizens, not Chinese.
&amp;#34;Legally speaking ~~CFIUS~~ has no business looking into US citizens~’ investments,&amp;#34; Wu said. &amp;#34;But we notified CFIUS to be on the safe side.&amp;#34;
Wu added that Sany had notified CFIUS about the Colorado investment and that the committee had no objections to the transaction.
&amp;#34;The case has progressed smoothly,&amp;#34; he said.
This represents a change of strategy, since Sany did not file with CFIUS prior to closing the Oregon transaction.
Informal consultations
As the entire CFIUS process is confidential, divining the exact concerns of the various government agencies involved – Treasury, Defense, Homeland Security and others – is not a simple task.
However, a source familiar with the situation told PaRR that as a result of the ownership changes Sany used in its new investment, CFIUS decided the planned Colorado deal was not a &amp;#34;covered transaction&amp;#34;— one that results in control of a US business being ceded to foreign person.
&amp;#34;The concept of control under CFIUS is not a bright-line,&amp;#34; said Gregory Jacobs, a partner at Reed Smith who deals with CFIUS matters. &amp;#34;If the PRC entity has the ability to control the purchasers, then the deal falls under CFIUS~’s jurisdiction.&amp;#34;
Traditionally, one way for foreign companies to avoid CFIUS jurisdiction is to invest through companies held by US citizens.
In such cases, executives from the acquirer would not take a seat on the board of the target company or have a say in corporate decisionmaking, Jacobs said, but added that many companies are not willing to sacrifice that level of control.
Therefore, foreign companies attempting to avoid possible CFIUS concerns could imitate Ralls and put greater distance between themselves and any assets being acquired.
The source familiar also said that for the Colorado deal, Sany engaged in &amp;#34;informal consultations&amp;#34; with CFIUS rather than making a formal filing.



====Current Chinese investments speeds up its expertise acquisition  – solves the case====
Brennan, 3/1/13 - Editor and Project Coordinator of research in resource security at the Institute for Security and Development Policy (ISDP), Stockholm, Sweden (Elliot, Asia Times, &amp;#34;Shale gas key to US Asia pivot&amp;#34; http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China_Business/CBIZ-01-010313.html-http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China_Business/CBIZ-01-010313.html)

In the US, improvements in extraction techniques of shale gas and other &amp;#34;unconventional
AND
Energy too with a joint venture in a shale gas play in Mississippi. 
Such a move helps speed up China~’s acquisition of expertise. Devon Energy hasn~’t been the only company China has picked up a stake in. Chinese National Oil Companies (NOCs) have invested in foreign companies and their knowledge, particularly in the US and Canada. A 2011 IAE report highlights partnerships that took place in 2010 between Chinese NOCs and Canadian companies with specific shale gas expertise. 
China National Petroleum Company/PetroChina purchased a 60% stake of an oil sand project in Alberta, and also formed a joint venture with Canadian Encana to develop shale gas plays in British Columbia. Meanwhile, more recent buy-ins by China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) have included a Chesapeake subsidiary and the takeover of Canadian firm Nexen, which is currently exploiting shale gas in British Columbia and expanding operations to Poland. 
The hunt for such expertise through joint ventures and partnerships is on the rise across 
AND
, knowledge is power - the US has it and China wants it. 
As well as this foreign absorption of expertise, Beijing is also pouring money into domestic research and development under the &amp;#34;National Key Technologies Research and Development Program&amp;#34; (1983) and other recent initiatives. But it can~’t move quickly enough. R%26D, just like technological know-how, takes time. 
The geopolitical changes such a shale revolution could bring may also shift the epicenter of 
AND
Asia where production depends primarily on more expensive, often imported, oil. 
According to a Price Waterhouse Coopers (PWC) report, shale gas could lead to a manufacturing boom as raw material and energy prices drop. This coupled with technological revolutions that decrease labor costs, could see a dramatic shift of some manufacturing away from Asia, and China, and back to the US. 
Foreign company expertise, particularly that of US companies, may provide significant improvements to 
AND
could provide the energy that China~’s growing middle class is so hungry for. 



====US-Sino energy cooperation is high now====

====Chinese FDI in the US is at record highs====
Steinbock, 13 - Dr. Dan Steinbock focuses on issues of international business and international relations, especially the post-crisis debt problems in the leading advanced economies (G-7) and the growth pains of the large emerging economies (BRICs and beyond). He is Research Director of International Business at the India, China and America Institute (USA) and Visiting Fellow at Shanghai Institutes for International Studies (China) where he concentrates on the G-20 economies.(Dan, &amp;#34;Foreign Investment Relocates in China and Asia&amp;#34; EconoMonitor, 2/27, http://www.economonitor.com/blog/2013/02/foreign-investment-relocates-in-china-and-asia/-http://www.economonitor.com/blog/2013/02/foreign-investment-relocates-in-china-and-asia/

As foreign investment is refocusing within China, Chinese foreign investment is refocusing worldwide, shifting from emerging Asia into the developed markets, including the United States and the Eurozone. In 2012, China~’s FDI into the United States enjoyed a record year. Chinese firms completed U.S. deals worth %246.5 billion, a 12 percent increase from the previous record of %245.8 billion in 2010.
In the past, Chinese multinationals invested in resource industries mainly in developing economies. 
AND
of sudden disruption, the growth story is likely to continue in 2013.
In the U.S. and the Eurozone, the accelerating Chinese FDI reflects a shift from the past one-way investment relationship to a genuine, two-way partnership. In turn, this long-anticipated structural story is driven by new FDI growth service engines in Chinese coastal megacities and FDI manufacturing operations in Chinese inland and west, as well as across Southeast Asia.



====Can~’t solve – China has its own restrictions that are worse than CFIUS====
Horby, 13 (Lucy, &amp;#34;China~’s Commerce minister seeks clearer U.S. investment guide&amp;#34; Reuters, http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/09/china-parliament-trade-idUSL4N0C02Y520130309-http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/09/china-parliament-trade-idUSL4N0C02Y520130309)

A U.S. Treasury Department spokeswoman in Washington defended the CFIUS system, which she called &amp;#34;transparent&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;true to the United States~’ open investment commitment.&amp;#34;
&amp;#34;The statute, executive order, regulations and guidance setting forth the CFIUS process are fully and publicly disclosed and available on the Treasury Department~’s website,&amp;#34; she said.
U.S. companies, for their part, complain China heavily restricts foreign investment in about 100 different sectors.
&amp;#34;In the May 2012 strategic and economic dialogue, China committed to open further to foreign investment and to focus its security reviews solely on national security concerns. We will continue to engage China on implementation of its commitments,&amp;#34; the Treasury Department spokeswoman said.
BARRIERS TO INVESTMENT
U.S. Treasury officials have sought to include information on CFIUS in regular meetings with Chinese officials, in the hopes that China will adopt some CFIUS features for its new national security review, particularly setting deadlines to respond to investment review requests.
International trading house Glencore has been waiting for months for a ruling from MofCom, which regulates anti-trust issues, for its planned takeover of zinc miner Xstrata.
China has blocked almost all attempts by foreigners to buy steel mills as well as a number of other high-profile deals, for instance an attempt by Coca-Cola Enterprises to purchase private juice maker Huiyuan.




====Relations are stable and resilient====
Associated Press, 3/16/13 (&amp;#34;New Chinese premier rejects US hacking claims, says committed to strong ties with Washington&amp;#34; Washington Post, http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/new-china-premier-committed-to-strong-ties-with-us-says-trade-investment-opportunities-good/2013/03/16/ad52cf04-8eb4-11e2-adca-74ab31da3399_story.html)

China~’s new leaders &amp;#34;attach great importance&amp;#34; to relations that meet the &amp;#34;fundamental interests of people in both countries and serves the global trend of peace and development,&amp;#34; Li told reporters at the traditional premier~’s news conference that follows the close of the annual legislative session.
China-U.S. ties have weathered a series of crises over the past year over dissidents, Chinese trade practices, opposition to Chinese investment in the U.S. and — most recently — hacking accusations. While basically stable, political ties are seen as lagging behind the economic relationship, with two-way trade hitting almost %24500 billion last year, and China~’s new president, Xi Jinping, isn~’t expected to meet President Barack Obama until an economic summit in Russia in September.
Following Xi~’s elevation, Li was appointed premier last week, with running China~’s economy his main responsibility.

====Energy production brings nature to serve, turning the world into a global gas station, eviscerating and erasing being. The ultimate result is nuclear annihilation and meaninglessness—comparatively outweighs ====
**Callister 2007 (Paul, Associate Professor of Law and Director of the Leon E. Bloch Law Library, University of Missouri‑Kansas City School of Law. Law and Heidegger~’s Question Concerning Technology:  Prolegomenon to Future Law Librarianship Law Library Journal ~~Vol. 99:2)**

 1 Following World War II, the German philosopher Martin Heidegger offered  one of 
AND
the world, including humanity,  as resources subject to a singular will.
We do not endorse the gendered language in this card  


====Belief in our ability to technologically manage the world is part of the problem. Complete control is never possible, but more often creates cycles of paralyzing anxiety and reactive desire to take action that only recreates the crisis====
**Peat, 08 – theoretical physicist, Ph.D., founder of the Pari Centre for New Learning (F. David, &amp;#34;Gentle Action: Surviving Chaos and Change&amp;#34;, http://www.gentleaction.org/library/paper2.php)**

Many rapid changes that are taking place around us. These include globalization, developments 
AND
change and engage in those actions that are appropriate to each new situation. 


====Hence, our alternative: do nothing.====

====Rejecting the call to action in the face of crisis opens space for solidarity to emerge through deep reflection on our relationship with the Earth. ====
**McWhorter 92, Professor of Philosophy at Northeast Missouri State, 92  (LaDelle, Heidegger and the Earth, ed: McWhorter, p. vii-viii)**

Heidegger frustrates us. At a time when the stakes are so very high and 
AND
also ground the most basic patterns of our current ways of being human.

====A) Magnitude:  Assuming power over nature unleashes the worst forms of violence====
**Dallmayr, 04 (PhD, Professor, Department of Government and International Studies, Notre Dame, Constellations Volume 11, No 1, 2004 The Underside of Modernity: Adorno, Heidegger, and Dussel Fred Dallmayr). **

Themes and insights of this kind are carried forward in Die Geschichte des Seyns, 
AND
&amp;#34;world wars&amp;#34; in the service of a globally unleashed Machenschaft.16 


====E) No Value to Life====
**Dillon 99, professor of politics at the University of Lancaster, 99  (Michael, Political Theory, April, ingenta select)**

The value of the subject became the standard unit of currency for the political arithmetic 
AND
life. Herewith, then, the necessity of championing the invaluable itself. 


====Before the construction of oil rigs there is always a wave of optimisim, and an effort to characterize the new tech as environmentally friendly, this is willful amnesia that makes the ultimate accident likely====
**Armitage and Virilio 99. John Armitage, Principal Lecturer in Politics and Media Studies at the University of Northumbria in the UK, and Paul Virilio, Director of the Ecole Speciale d~’Architecutre, Theory, Culture %26 Society 1999 (SAGE, London, Thousand Oaks and New Delhi), Vol. 16(5, 6): 25-55 WM**

PV: Let me put it this way: every time a technology is invented
AND
~~ Asia is an integral accident, well, almost an integral accident.



====Hegemonic knowledge rearranges empirics to construct a particular reality====
**Shaw 99, (Professor of political science, University of Victoria), 99  (Karena, 9 Transnational Law %26 Contemporary Problems 569, lexis) **

Again, however, the key question is why we should read these struggles 
AND
mythology and logics of sovereignty, potentially facilitating further violences in its name. 





====This collusion of power-knowledge in the military-academic complex has produced a domination of strategic studies and academic circles by the expanding realm of the military – this erases accountability for violence and denies the importance of the ethical questions behind the technology we develop. This inevitably produces catastrophe and depoliticizes violence.====
**Morrissey 11 (John Morrissey, Department of Geography, National University of Ireland, 2011, Architects of Empire: The Military–Strategic Studies Complex and the Scripting of US National Security Antipode Vol. 43, pp 435–470~~)**
 
In the power–knowledge symmetry of the academic–military world, strategic studies 
AND
Orientalism (Gregory 2004; Little 2002; Said 2003; Shapiro 1997).
Collusion between &amp;#34;knowledge&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;power&amp;#34; must be forcefully exposed, as 
AND
possesses vital forums through which to enunciate their endgame: legitimized state violence. 


====Their authors are biased by privilege; trade causes genocide and ethnic cleansing====
**Alves 2000 – US diplomat to Brazil (José A. Lindgren, Human Rights Quarterly 22.2, 478-500)**

The term &amp;#34;globalization&amp;#34; itself is misleading. Besides erroneously implying the existence of 
AND
the West—and aggressive homophobia, still present and often violent worldwide.  




====Russo-phobia skews their perspective—American objectivism makes the impact inevitable====
**Lieven 1, (Senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace), 01 (World Policy Journal. New York: Winter 2000/2001.Vol.17, Iss. 4;  pg. 25)**

Ever since the Cold War ended, Western officials and commentators have been telling the 
AND
in which certain nations are classed as irrationally, irredeemably savage and wicked.



====They missed the boat - this is not a question of whether ontology focus is good or bad, but correct or incorrect. Their framework is non-responsive. We are not saying they aren~’t allowed to access the case - but that they can not without first winning their ontology. They can still advance federal policy, they just have to deal with this prior question====
**Dillon, 99 (Prof of Politics, University of Lancaster), 99 (Moral Spaces, p. 97-98). **

Heirs to all this, we find ourselves in the turbulent and now globalized wake 
AND
mock innocent political slaves who claim only to be technocrats of decision making.


====Turns policymaking—only investigating ontology ensures effective policy solutions. ====
**Murphy 2005, Miami sociology professor, 2005 (John, Globalization with a Human Face, pg 11-13, ldg)**
 
The process of development, now commonly referred to as globalization, has been analyzed 
AND
simply adjust to economic policies that are equated with rationality and general improvement. 


====Roleplaying DA – pretending to be the federal government ignores our personal responsibility for war and makes the perpetuation of violence inevitable====
**Kappeler 95 (Susanne is an associate professor at al-akhawayn university, &amp;#34;the will to violence: the politics of personal behavior&amp;#34;, pg. 10-11, MT)	**
Which is why many of those not yet entirely disillusioned with politics tend to engage 
AND
our values~’ according to the structures and the values of war and violence.



====Ontological reconsideration solves warming and allow us to use energy without the managerial mindset====
**Grego, 07 (Associate Professor in the Department of Humanities/Culture at Dayton Beach College. Richard, &amp;#34;Global Warming, Environmental Philosophy and Public Policy: John Dewey vs. Martin Heidegger,&amp;#34; http://www.philosophos.com/philosophy_article_153.html)**
How any of this might translate into an actual environmental policy is anyone~’s guess (
AND
humanity, might be just what is needed for the earth~’s sustainable future.


====Reflection solves====
**Best and Nocella, 06 –associate professor of philosophy at the University of Texas at El Paso (Igniting a Revolution:  Voices in Defense of the Earth, p. 82-84, google books)**

Yet, for both Heidegger and revolutionary environmentalists, there exist possibilities for transformation despite 
AND
to be discerned so that new forms and uses of technology can emerge.  





====Their impact calc is flawed—logically every detail added to a scenario makes it a priori less likely. More vague scenarios are always more probabilistic====
**Yudkowsky ~’6 Research Fellow at the Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence &amp;#34;Cognitive biases potentially affecting judgment of global risks&amp;#34; Forthcoming in Global Catastrophic Risks,  eds. Nick Bostrom and Milan CirkovicDraft of August 31, 2006. Eliezer Yudkowsky(yudkowsky@singinst.org)**

The conjunction fallacy similarly applies to futurological forecasts. Two independent sets of professional analysts 
AND
, adding additional detail onto a story must render the story less probable.


 It is less probable that Linda is a feminist bank teller than that she

But any further significant delay could jeopardize that timeline.

2nc pc key/at: hirsh

Hirsh’s point is that PC’s not key because some GOP figures want reform for the Latino vote, so leaders like Jindal are calling for it 
Hirsh 2/7 Michael, chief correspondent for National Journal, previously served as the senior editor and national economics correspondent for Newsweek, has appeared many times as a commentator on Fox News, CNN, MSNBC, and National Public Radio, has written for the Associated Press, The New York Times, The Washington Post, Foreign Affairs, Harper’s, and Washington Monthly, and authored two books, &amp;#34;There&amp;#39;s No Such Thing as Political Capital&amp;#34;, 2013, www.nationaljournal.com/magazine/there-s-no-such-thing-as-political-capital-20130207

Meanwhile, the Republican members of the Senate’s so-called Gang of Eight are pushing hard for
AND
 country where the 2010 census showed, for the first time, that white births have fallen into the minority. It’s got nothing to do with Obama’s political capital or, indeed, Obama at all.

That thesis is wrong—those people are the minority—even if presidential hopefuls can’t bash immigrants, Congress can—clearly makes PC key
Robert Mann 1-28, holds the Manship Chair at the Manship School of Mass Communication at Louisiana State University and is director of the school’s Reilly Center for Media and Public Affairs, 1/28/13, “The GOP and Latinos: Will immigration reform change their relationship? Not likely,” http://bobmannblog.com/2013/01/28/the-gop-and-latinos-will-immigration-reform-change-their-relationship-not-likely/

Having lost the popular vote in five of the last six presidential elections, some Republican leaders in
AND
 presidential races, but it’s still a very effective strategy in some local and state politics in many places around the country. 

Hirsh’s other point is that PC isn’t objectively measurable—but it still exists and is key to immigration—Obama has to make political deals—this proves bargaining and persuasion are key, even on other issues
Jonathan Bernstein 1-28, Assistant Professor of Political Science at UTSA, 1/28/13, “On immigration, Obama should opt for a persuasive vagueness,” http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2013/01/28/on-immigration-obama-should-opt-for-a-persuasive-vagueness/

GOP RESISTANCE TO IMMIGRATION REFORM CRUMBLES. Many are talking about the New York Times story today that begins as follows: “Republican opposition to legalizing the status of millions of illegal immigrants is crumbling in the nation’s capital as leading lawmakers in the party scramble to halt eroding support among Hispanic voters—a shift that is providing strong momentum for an overhaul of immigration laws.” The story goes on to note recent comments from Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., urging a new way forward, but points out that lawmakers like Paul are being careful to avoid the perception that they support amnesty.
