Most recently, Kate was the co-director of the national Apollo Alliance, where she still serves as senior policy advisor. Former senior associate at the Center on Wisconsin Strategy) April **2011** &amp;#34;The Importance and Promise of American Manufacturing&amp;#34; [[http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2011/04/pdf/manufacturing.pdf-http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2011/04/pdf/manufacturing.pdf]]Manufacturing is critically important to the American economy. For generations, the strength of our country rested on the power of our factory floors—both the machines and the men and women who worked them. We need manufacturing to continue to be a bedrock of strength for generations to come. Manufacturing is woven into the structure of our economy: Its importance goes far beyond what happens behind the factory gates. The strength or weakness of American manufacturing carries implications for the entire economy, our national security, and the well-being of all Americans. Manufacturing today accounts for 12 percent of the U.S. economy and about 11 percent of the private-sector workforce. But its significance is even greater than these numbers would suggest. The direct impact of manufacturing is only a part of the picture. First, jobs in the manufacturing sector are good middle-class jobs for millions of Americans. Those jobs serve an important role, offering economic opportunity to hard-working, middle-skill workers. This creates upward mobility and broadens and strengthens the middle class to the benefit of the entire economy. What~’s more, U.S.-based manufacturing underpins a broad range of jobs that are quite different from the usual image of manufacturing. These are higher-skill service jobs that include the accountants, bankers, and lawyers that are associated with any industry, as well as a broad range of other jobs including basic research and technology development, product and process engineering and design, operations and maintenance, transportation, testing, and lab work. Many of these jobs are critical to American technology and innovation leadership. The problem today is this: Many multinational corporations may for a period keep these higher-skill jobs here at home while they move basic manufacturing elsewhere in response to other countries~’ subsidies, the search for cheaper labor costs, and the desire for more direct access to overseas markets, but eventually many of these service jobs will follow. When the basic manufacturing leaves, the feedback loop from the manufacturing floor to the rest of a manufacturing operation—a critical element in the innovative process—is eventually broken. To maintain that feedback loop, companies need to move higher-skill jobs to where they do their manufacturing. And with those jobs goes American leadership in technology and innovation. This is why having a critical mass of both manufacturing and associated service jobs in the United States matters. The &amp;#34;industrial commons&amp;#34; that comes from the crossfertilization and engagement of a community of experts in industry, academia, and government is vital to our nation~’s economic competitiveness. Manufacturing also is important for the nation~’s economic stability. The experience of the Great Recession exemplifies this point. Although manufacturing plunged in 2008 and early 2009 along with the rest of the economy, it is on the rebound today while other key economic sectors, such as construction, still languish. Diversity in the economy is important—and manufacturing is a particularly important part of the mix. Although manufacturing is certainly affected by broader economic events, the sector~’s internal diversity—supplying consumer goods as well as industrial goods, serving both domestic and external markets— gives it great potential resiliency. Finally, supplying our own needs through a strong domestic manufacturing sector protects us from international economic and political disruptions. This is most obviously important in the realm of national security, even narrowly defined as matters related to military strength, where the risk of a weak manufacturing capability is obvious. But overreliance on imports and substantial manufacturing trade deficits weaken us in many ways, making us vulnerable to everything from exchange rate fluctuations to trade embargoes to natural disasters.&#xD;

====Bookchin is wrong—there is no correlation between hierarchy and domination of nature. ====
White, 03. Lecturer at Goldsmith College. &amp;#34;Hierarchy, Domination, Nature,&amp;#34; Organization and Environment, Sage Journals, Damian Finbar.

It would seem evident, though, that the historical sequence Bookchin (1995b) 
AND
to conceptualise a relatively nonhierarchical society that is nevertheless extremely exploitative ecologically. 22 

====There is no correlation between hierarchy and social domination—the alternative is more likely to increase social domination. ====
White, 03. Damian Finbar , Lecturer at Goldsmith College. &amp;#34;Hierarchy, Domination, Nature,&amp;#34; Organization and Environment, Sage Journals.

To move on from the organic society issue then, how plausible is the rest 
AND
hierarchy, social domination, and the &amp;#34;idea&amp;#34; of dominating nature?

====Perm solves: Bookchin thinks that a wide variety of political strategies need to be tried simultaneously. ====
Bookchin and Foreman, 91 – Murray, founder of the social ecology movement within a libertarian/ecological thought, and Dave, US environmentalist and founder of Earth First%21 (Defending the Earth: a dialogue between Murray Bookchin and Dave Foreman, South End Press @ Boston, Ed. 1, Pg. 39-40)  AK

We were pretty clear from the beginning, however, that we were not 
AND
we~’re covering all the bases. We need all the approaches and angles.

====Bioregionalism would cause more rapid environmental destruction. ====
White, 03. Lecturer at Goldsmith College. &amp;#34;Hierarchy, Domination, Nature,&amp;#34; Organization and Environment, Sage Journals, Damian Finbar.

More substantial difficulties with organic society can be found at the methodological level. One 
AND
relations to animals as other was largely complementary&amp;#34; (p. xlvii). 

====The transition to bioregionalism will cause major wars. ====
Taylor, 2000 – Oshkosh Foundation Professor of Religion and Social Ethics, and Director of Environmental Studies at the University of Wisconsin (Bron, Beneath the Surface, 2000, pg. 282) 

It is not clear, however, that in the long run and on every 
AND
but often overlooked point about political power, political theorist Daniel Deudney warns:

====Bookchin~’s bioregionalism would result in small, oppressive communities. ====
Carter, 07. Senior Lecturer in Politics @ University of York. &amp;#34;The Politics of the Environment,&amp;#34; p. 59, Neil.

Decentralization may be a necessary condition for participatory democracy, but there is no guarantee 
AND
ironically, the homogenous decentralized society may lack the diversity that ecologists value.

====Bookchin~’s alternative fails—small societies force conformity that prevent innovation and undermine cooperation. ====
diZerega, 92. PhD in Political Theory and Visiting Assistant professor in the Department of Government, St. Lawrence University. Gus, Spring/Summer, &amp;#34;SOCIAL ECOLOGY, DEEP ECOLOGY, AND LIBERALISM,&amp;#34; Critical Review, http://www.dizerega.com/papers/socecol.pdf.

From a neoliberal perspective I will develop two basic criticisms of Bookchin~’s argument. First
AND
market~’s role in coordinating intricate relationships among independent entities is a fatal weakness.

====Bookchin~’s ideological focus alienates the public and prevents a broad-scale movement. ====
Clark, 98. John, Professor of Philosophy at Loyola. &amp;#34;Municipal Dreams: A Social Ecological Critique of Bookchin~’s Politics,&amp;#34; http://raforum.info/article.php3?id_article=1039.

While &amp;#34;the People&amp;#34; are identified by Bookchin as the emerging subject of history 
AND
, a more expansive vision of the socially-transformative practice is necessary.

====Bioregionalism is too isolated to solve—international solutions are needed. ====
Taylor, 2000 – Oshkosh Foundation Professor of Religion and Social Ethics, and Director of Environmental Studies at the University of Wisconsin (Bron, Beneath the Surface, 2000, pg. 282) 

Bioregionalism generally fails to grapple adequately with the problem of power. Consequently, it 
AND
deep ecological spirituality, hoping, self-consciously, for a miracle. 

====Engaging institutions is essential to protect the environment – bioregionalism and localized activism does not provide not a lens for substantive social change====
Harvey, 99 – Distinguished Professor of Anthropology at the City University of New York (David, Global Ethics and Environment)

But the content and spirit of any such ~’revolutionary~’ movement is a very much more 
AND
future geographies of production, distribu¬tion, consumption and exchange might be produced.

enhancing predictability and legal certainty guidelines contribute towards the effectiveness of competition policy.

Currently world gas trade is concentrated in three regional markets: North America, Europe

are major implications for U.S. natural gas production and use.

====Diverse supply solves====
Baker Institute, ’8 (Baker Institute for Public Policy, Rice University, Baker Institute Policy Report, January 2008, &amp;#34;Natural Gas in North America: Markets and Security,&amp;#34; http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/30064519/study-lift-u-s-drilling-restrictions-avoid-international-lng-cartel-http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/30064519/study-lift-u-s-drilling-restrictions-avoid-international-lng-cartel)CC
Significant growth in trade in natural gas has been a major feature of international energy 
AND
higher elasticity of demand translates into reduced market power of a potential cartel.

In fact, although the 1990s was a period of instability, economic collapse, and revolutionary change in political and economic institutions, the state performed roughly as well as it does today, when the country has been relatively &amp;#34;stable&amp;#34; and its economy is growing rapidly. Even in good economic times, autocracy has done no better than democracy at promoting public safety, health, or a secure legal and property-owning environment.
