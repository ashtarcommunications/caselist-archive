Shale is terminally unsustainable – conventional gas key to avert price spikes and domino effects across the industry
Engdahl, 3/13/13 William, an American German freelance journalist, historian and economic researcher, a degree in engineering and jurisprudence from Princeton University in 1966 (BA), and graduate study in comparative economics at the University of Stockholm from 1969 to 1970, he worked as an economist and in Europe. His first book was called A Century of War: Anglo-American Oil Politics and the New World Order, and discusses the alleged roles of Zbigniew Brzezinski and George Ball and of the USA in the 1979 overthrow of the Shah of Iran, which was meant to manipulate oil prices and to stop Soviet expansion. Engdahl claims that Brzezinski and Ball used the Islamic Balkanization model proposed by Bernard Lewis. In 2007, he completed Seeds of Destruction: The Hidden Agenda of Genetic Manipulation.
Engdahl is also a frequent contributor to the website of the Centre for Research on Globalization.
William Engdahl has been married since 1987, and has been living for more than two decades near Frankfurt am Main, Germany., The Fracked-up USA Shale Gas Bubble, http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-fracked-up-usa-shale-gas-bubble/5326504 
Shale gas has recently come onto the gas market in the US via use of several combined … with drilling rigs.” 36 The much-touted shale gas revolution in the USA is collapsing along with the stock shares of Chesapeake and other key players. 

And, that ensures catastrophic price spikes
Maize, 12/1/12 “Is Shale Gas Shallow or the Real Deal?”, Kennedy, Veteran Journalist Kennedy Maize has spent the past 40 years working as a journalist, analyst, and manager in the private sector and federal government, with over 35 years of that focused on energy and environmental topics. Over that time, he has seen myriad examples of how group think, policy fads, and bad judgment can result in colossal failures, particularly in the field of atomic energy. Maize has seen, up close and personal, the demise of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, the arrival of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the birth of the U.S. Department of Energy, the failures of nuclear flight, the hubris of atomic earthmoving, the boom and bust uranium market, the birth and death of breeder reactors, and the 60-year wandering in the wilderness of nuclear waste policy. After graduating from Penn State and graduate study at the University of Maryland, Kennedy Maize worked for newspapers in Pennsylvania, New York, and Virginia and the Associated Press in Baltimore. He then spent five years in management at the National Institute of Health and the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission before taking a job covering energy, environment, and business topics for Editorial Research Reports, a division of Congressional Quarterly, where his work appeared in over 1,000 daily newspapers in the U.S. during the mid-to-late 1970s. Maize became a staff writer and editor at The Energy Daily, a preeminent energy trade paper, on March 28, 1979, the day the Three Mile Island accident began outside Harrisburg, Pa. Over more than 10 years at The Energy Daily, he covered the nuclear and coal industries, including stories involving the Clinch River Breeder Reactor, the U.S. Synthetic Fuels Corp., the Powder River Basin coal leasing scandal, and the Chernobyl explosion. In 1993, he founded The Electricity Daily, where he was the editor for 14 years, writing about changes in the electricity business, the rise and fall of Enron, the stagnation of the nuclear power business, and the arrival of market forces in the utility field. Since 2006, he has been an editor at POWER magazine, and the founder of MANAGING POWER magazine, where he has written about the Fukushima catastrophe, the emergence of shale gas and decline of coal, and the often ill-advised push for renewable electricity technologies http://www.powermag.com/gas/Is-Shale-Gas-Shallow-or-the-Real-Deal_5188.html

And the result is that profit-seeking will be increasingly lured into those countries whose interests are not guarded by judicious men. Future historians will bring to light how much craving raw materials for the future is to blame for ~~our~~ great misfortune.
Fossil raw materials should therefore not be abandoned to ~’national egoism~’ and ~’industrial profit-seeking~’. Mankind needs to arrive at the insight that it must ~’replace ~~those raw materials~~ with the manpower that the sun pours out over us in inexhaustible amounts~’, whether directly or ~’indirectly via the amounts of energy originating from the sun, amassed in streams of water and greening plant life~’.3
Natural scientists – for whom it was more than self-evident at the beginning 
AND
techniques repeatedly provided new excuses for brashly repressing awareness of the mounting dangers. 
Falling back on the sun was felt to be a relapse back to a time 
AND
even of nuclear weapons, which were assigned the role of deterring wars.
In this way the basic pattern was woven for worldwide energy conflict in the second 
AND
until nuclear energy became discredited by the fateful warning of Chernobyl in 1986.

Ecological thinking needs to be holistic so that its impact can be understood in context

imperatives of thinking and acting to heeding what they tell us to do.

====The 1ac is critical of labels of ~’utopian politics~’ in the debate space. Visionary politics is the best way to promote advocacy skills, detached policymaking rehashes the same disenfranchised debate every round.====
McGee and Romanelli 97 – Assistant Professor in Communication Studies at Texas Tech AND Director of Debate at Loyola University of Chicago
(Brian and David, &amp;#34;Policy Debate as Fiction: In Defense of Utopian Fiat&amp;#34;, Contemporary  Argumentation and Debate 18 (1997) 23-35, dml)
Snider argued several years ago that a suitable paradigm should address &amp;#34;something we can ACTUALLY  DO&amp;#34; as opposed to something we can MAKE BELIEVE ABOUT&amp;#34; (&amp;#34;Fantasy as Reality&amp;#34; 14).  A utopian literature metaphor is beneficial precisely because it is within the power of debaters to perform the desired action suggested by the metaphor, if not always to demonstrate that the desired action is politically feasible.
Instead of debaters playing to an audience of those who make public policy, debaters 
AND
devotees of Beavis and Butthead, social criticism is what good citizens do. 
Debate differs from other species of social criticism because debate is a game played by 
AND
a variety of social criticism gives debate an added dimension of public relevance.
One way to understand the distinction between debate as policy-making and debate as 
AND
the United States without comprehending the confluence of the formal and public agenda.
In intercollegiate debate, the policy-making metaphor has given primacy to formal agenda 
AND
Dempsey on the &amp;#34;real-world&amp;#34; limitations for making policy indicates.
Debate as social criticism does not entail exclusion of formal agenda concerns from intercollegiate debate
AND
they are working in their own modest way to shape the public agenda.
While &amp;#34;social criticism&amp;#34; is the best explanation for what debaters do, this 
AND
, the distinction makes no difference in the utopian practice of intercollegiate debate.
More importantly, intercollegiate debate is utopian in another sense.  Policy change is considered 
AND
be able to travel intelligently at all&amp;#34; (Mumford 24-25).
An objection to this guiding metaphor is that it encourages debaters to do precisely that 
AND
by pointing to the potential dystopic consequences of accepting such proposals for change.

science, however, the nomothetic approach has advanced little beyond electoral studies.
My own approach is definitely nomothetic. This is related to my training in psychology at one of the first German universities focusing on quantitative research methods in the early 1960s, the University of Hamburg. This epistemological orientation has been reinforced by graduate training in international politics at one of the first American universities emphasizing quantitative research in the late 1960s, Northwestern University, which is located in a suburb of Chicago.
Nomothetic research focuses on hypothesizing, testing and establishing law-like general statements or

====The status quo ensures the development of coal – high costs for natural gas prompt a shift back to coal fired plants ====

====CO2 emissions will run away in the status quo—natural gas is the only effective alternative to coal—U.S. development is modeled globally and prevents feedbacks====
**Riley 12—BA, LL.M., PhD, professor of energy law at The City Law School at City University London (Alan, 8/13/12, &amp;#34;Shale Gas to the Climate Rescue,&amp;#34; http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/14/opinion/shale-gas-to-the-climate-rescue.html, RBatra)**

The battle against runaway climate change is being lost.** The green movement and the energy industry — while engaged in a furious debate on issues from nuclear power to oil sands — are missing the bigger picture.**
**There is little recognition by either side that **current policies to reduce carbon dioxide emissions are inadequate** for dealing with the threat that they pose. **It is the coal-fueled growth of countries like China and India that generates much of these emissions. Unless a cheap, rapidly deployable substitute fuel is found for coal, then it will be next to impossible to safely rein in rising carbon dioxide levels around the world.
**Although the green movement might at first see shale gas as an enemy in this fight, it may in fact turn out to be a friend. **Broad development of shale gas resources** — with proper ecological safeguards — **could be the best way to achieve the quick cuts in carbon dioxide emissions that we need to maintain a habitable environment on Earth.
The International Energy Agency has made it clear that, under current energy policies, 
AND
, it appears the temperature-increase target will most likely be missed.
**The shale gas revolution could be the means of blunting the rise of carbon dioxide emissions and give new hope for staying within the 2 degrees Celsius scenario. This resource is widely dispersed across the planet, cheap to develop and offers many of the same energy benefits as coal. If exploited properly, it could replace coal within a couple of decades as a primary fuel.**
**By developing shale gas as a replacement fuel for coal we retrieve the prospect of blunting — and possibly reversing — the upward climb of carbon dioxide emissions. **Shale gas emits 50 percent less carbon dioxide than coal, and so if countries like China and India made the switch on a large scale, then we have a chance to reset the trajectory of global** carbon dioxide **emissions**.**
A widespread turn to the use of shale gas would give the planet precious time to develop** other, **renewable solutions to further lower our output of carbon dioxide. Current renewable** **energy** sources **cannot** in any way **deliver the same savings in** carbon **emissions that we can** **achieve by replacing coal with shale gas.
One only has to look to China to see the strong potential of this solution
AND
reason to think it cannot pump out 800 billion cubic meters by 2030?
**Such a development program would be similar in scale to that undertaken in the United States, which has seen shale gas rise from 1 percent of gas production in 2001 to 37 percent last year.**
China can surely achieve these goals, especially given all the new technology available to 
AND
expansion plans and ultimately end its reliance on coal-fired energy altogether.
The United States could play a key role in encouraging China and other developing nations 
AND
of radical cuts in carbon dioxide emissions over the short and medium term.


====Independently, coal destroys ecosystems====
**Bosselman 07** (Fred Bosselman (Professor of Law Emeritus, Chicago-Kent College of Law) 2007 &amp;#34;The new power generation: environmental law and electricity innovation: colloquium article: the ecological advantages of nuclear power&amp;#34;, New York University Environmental Law Journal, lexis)

Virtually all of the coal mined in the United States is used as boiler fuel 
AND
travel long distances and create acid rain that significantly harms plants and animals. 


====The coal industry is based on economic exploitation that destroys communities and perpetuates hierarchies—this is exemplified by corporate silencing of opposition in places like Appalachia and India====
**Ghio 11 (Nicole, September 2011, Coal Country: From India to the Heart of Appalachia, Day Three, **http://sierraclub.typepad.com/compass/2011/09/coal-india-appalachia.html-http://sierraclub.typepad.com/compass/2011/09/coal-india-appalachia.html**, RBatra)**

The most marginalized people are the easiest to exploit.
Coal never brings economic prosperity to local communities, whether they are in Appalachia or 
AND
another industry, such as tourism, is blown away with the mountains.
Coal keeps communities poor, and anyone who attempts to fight the companies is seen as fighting the state.
**This is something Vaishali is very familiar with. **When Konkan fishermen and rural farmers whose livelihoods are at risk from massive coal development protest** the **companies** that are exploiting them, **the state cracks down. In places like Andhra Pradesh, violence reminiscent of West Virginia~’s coal wars is breaking out.
Just as in West Virginia, the coal companies in Konkan are destroying all other 
AND
over by power companies in need of imported coal to feed their plants.
Amulya is seeing the same thing happen on the other side of India in Orissa
AND
the toxic pollutants through leaky pipes into faulty impoundments, further poisoning communities.
As in West Virginia, the Orissa~’s coal companies exploit the situation with poor labor practices.** The rural farmers who lost their livelihoods can~’t even get a job in the coal mines or at the plants because **they employ contract laborers with little job security that are unlikely to unionize.


====And, the placement of coal plants is highly racialized—people of color are subject to extremely high rates of pollution====
**Roberts 12 (David, 3/30/12, Black people get asthma so everybody else can get cheap power, **http://grist.org/coal/black-people-get-asthma-so-everybody-else-can-get-cheap-power/-http://grist.org/coal/black-people-get-asthma-so-everybody-else-can-get-cheap-power/**, RBatra)**

**Dominique Browning gets right to the point in &amp;#34;The Racial Politics of Asthma.&amp;#34; I~’m tempted to excerpt the whole thing, but this is the important bit:**
**    **In 2008, African Americans had a 35 percent higher** ~~PDF~~ **rate of asthma than Caucasians**. A study revealed that **one-quarter of the children in** New York City~’s **Harlem have asthma**. The following national statistics are even more jarring:**
African American children have a:
**• **260% higher emergency room visit rate.
**• **250% higher hospitalization rate.
**• **500% higher death rate from asthma, as compared with white children**.**
**Why? **One likely reason is that 68% of African-Americans (compared to 56% of whites) live within** ~~PDF~~ **30 miles of a coal-fired power plant—the distance within which the maximum ill effects of the emissions from smokestacks occur.
**It has long been the case that **victims of air pollution are disproportionately poor urban minorities**, especially children. A study last year out of Duke confirmed that &amp;#34;non-Hispanic blacks are consistently overrepresented in communities with the poorest air quality.&amp;#34; For the most part, this is just another way of saying that blacks are overrepresented **in communities with high levels of poverty. That~’s where the coal plants get put.
**And make no mistake: the pollution is where the coal plants are.**
The Eastern U.S. has come to an arrangement: poor communities and communities of color will get more asthma; the rest of the Eastern seaboard and Midwest will get cheap electricity.
**Of course nobody likes to think of it that way. At one Senate hearing on the EPA budget, Browning notes, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) called air pollution victims &amp;#34;unidentified and imaginary.&amp;#34; If we don~’t think about them, they don~’t exist%21**
Battles over** EPA air-quality rules **are usually discussed in terms of economics, but we would be naive to think that the politics of race and class are not everywhere just beneath the surface.


====And, natural gas acts as a bridge fuel—spurring broad renewable development====
**Ju 12 – **Anne Ju (senior science writer for the Cornell Chronicle) July 17, 2012 &amp;#34;Study Proves Natural Gas Can Bridge the Gap to a Clean Energy Economy&amp;#34; http://oilprice.com/Energy/Natural-Gas/Study-Proves-Natural-Gas-Can-Bridge-the-Gap-to-a-Clean-Energy-Economy.html-http://oilprice.com/Energy/Natural-Gas/Study-Proves-Natural-Gas-Can-Bridge-the-Gap-to-a-Clean-Energy-Economy.html

Natural gas is a good transition step on the road to greener energy sources like 
AND

Allowing greenhouse gas emissions is a moral choice—we must orient our ethics towards coexistence with nature and respect for future generations
Nety 11—writer at Triple Helix, a blog at Cornell University (Suchita, 29 January 2011, &amp;#34;Climate Change: An Ethical Perspective on Mitigating its Impact,&amp;#34; http://triplehelixblog.com/2011/01/climate-change-an-ethical-perspective-on-mitigating-its-impact/-http://triplehelixblog.com/2011/01/climate-change-an-ethical-perspective-on-mitigating-its-impact/, RBatra)

Climate change, the shifting temperature of the earth due to amplified levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases (GHGs) from fossil fuels and deforestation, is currently a topic of heated discussions worldwide. In 2007, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a United Nations organization, stated that &amp;#34;warming of the climate system is unequivocal&amp;#34; ~~1~~.
GHGs persist in the atmosphere for hundreds of years ~~2~~. Climate change is thus a very unique issue as its effects transcend time and space: GHGs emitted now in any location will affect the whole planet for many generations to come. Therefore, the generation that knowingly creates negative climate change should make every effort to reduce that impact; this represents a moral choice.
The Kyoto Protocol of 1998 was organized to develop limits that would stabilize levels of 
AND
statement reflects the sentiment of a large majority of climate change policy opponents:
&amp;#34;The estimated costs ~~of the proposal~~ are staggering. So is the sweep of regulations that could severely affect nearly every major energy-using product from cars to lawnmowers, and a million or more businesses ~~which will be forced to curb emissions~~ and buildings of all types. And all of this sacrifice is in order to make, at best, a minuscule contribution to an overstated environmental threat&amp;#34; ~~4~~.
Two issues are brought up in this statement: first, that the proposed policy was considered on an economic level only, and second, that the consequences of the human role in climate change are overestimated. An ethical perspective renders both of these claims irrelevant.
Climate change has tremendous impact because it is the result of a vast network of 
AND
patterns; and highly altered life cycles of species ~~2, 6~~.
The largest share of GHG emissions are those of developed nations: since 1850 the 
AND
rely disproportionately on agricultural productivity – 40% of economic activity ~~8~~.
However, while the consequences that developing nations suffer are indeed harsh, data collected 
AND
this figure results from the sheer magnitude of the species which go undiscovered.
Ironically, the most serious victims of climate change are also the ones who do 
AND
Trying to fix an ethical problem with an economic solution is simply deficient.
On the other hand, the ethical obligations that society should take into consideration can 
AND
forced to accept these obligations and deal with them in a just manner.
Throughout the history of the United States, society has benefited by enacting laws that 
AND
needed. Thus, significant progress in climate change policy can be made.
Climate change is a universal issue, one that affects all life on the planet, and therefore settling the adverse effects is an ethical decision. As a country with strong relations with much of the world, the United States can take the lead in bringing nations together in a collaborative effort to fix the global problem with a global solution.

MOST of the gains made by the world~’s poorest countries over the past half a century will be lost unless action is taken on climate change**, Oxfam says.**
**A report by the international aid agency says up to 375 million people may be affected by climate-related disasters by 2015.**
**&amp;#34;**Climate change is becoming quite rapidly the central issue to do with poverty today**&amp;#34;, Oxfam Australia~’s chief, Andrew Hewett, told the Herald. &amp;#34;That also raises deep ethical dilemmas because **the people least responsible for this crisis have the least resources to deal with it, and they are also those who are on the front line**.&amp;#34;**
**Oxfam is publishing the report, Suffering The Science-Climate Change, People And Poverty, today before this week~’s meeting of world leaders at the Group of Eight summit in Italy, where climate change and food security will be high on the agenda.**
**Advertisement**
**On the side of the G8 meeting there will also be a forum of leaders and ministers from the biggest polluting world economies, which the Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, and Climate Change Minister, Penny Wong, will attend.**
**A key issue at both meetings will be whether the US President, Barack Obama, publicly embraces the scientific goal of keeping the world~’s temperature from rising above 2 degrees Celsius in order to avoid dangerous climate change.**
**Britain~’s Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, and European leaders have been urging the US to embrace the goal, and Reuters has reported that **the 2-degree target has been included in the draft communique.
**If Mr Obama supports the scientific goal he will raise expectations that the United Nations global climate talks in Copenhagen in December will be able to achieve an ambitious outcome. Including the 2-degree goal in the G8 communique also puts pressure on Japan, Canada and Russia to agree to tougher action to cut greenhouse gas emissions.**
The Oxfam report stresses the importance of the scientific goal, arguing that even a 2-degree temperature rise will have serious consequences for people living in poverty.
**With advancing climate change, **several big cities dependent on** the **Himalayan and Andes glaciers will face** crippling **water shortages within decades**, the report says. The two most important world food crops, **rice and maize, will also be reduced even under mild climate change.
Hunger caused by climate change may be the defining human tragedy of this century**, the report argues, and **if global warming is allowed to proceed unchecked the true cost &amp;#34;will not be measured in dollars but in millions or billions of lives&amp;#34;.

Similarly, Social Security, which provides protection against low income in retirement to employees who contribute to the system, has helped to foster an extraordinary level of participation by the elderly in the electoral process and civic life. Social Security has encouraged participation by low- and moderate-income seniors, which means that the elderly are less subject to the skew in favor of the affluent and better educated that generally characterizes political participation in the United States.37
