The problem with this reassuring reading of the past is that it is not entirely 
AND
their breadth and depth. These two negatives will be examined in turn.
Nuclear archives, as other sensitive governmental archives, open up usually after an interval 
AND
the technology for their control has been vastly improved, several facts remain:
the US has continued to witness serious procedural lapses in the military nuclear arena (
AND
World War III nearly occurred, and which characterize India and Pakistan today.
Despite the dearth of detail on Indian and Pakistani nuclear crisis management, we know that the stability of nuclear deterrence between India and Pakistan is by no means a given, with serious risks occurring on several occasions since the mid-1980s(17).
At another level of analysis, we have to recognize the limits of the database 
AND
or Middle Eastern conflict. Give it another seventy years to pass judgment?
The same empirical limits apply to the number of actors at play: we have 
AND
only know what we know, we don~’t know what we don~’t know.
A historical narrative which is not reassuring and an empirical record that is less than compelling need to inform the manner in which we approach further proliferation.
PROLIFERATION PUSH AND PULL
Ongoing proliferation differs from that of the first halfcentury of the nuclear era in three 
AND
age. Taken together, these changes entail growing risks of nuclear use.
Demand is currently focusing on two regions, the Middle East and East Asia (
AND
Q.Khan network (see below)to some of his clients.
Although North Korea~’s nuclear ambitions appear to be both more self-centered and more containable than is the case for Iran, the possibility of state collapse in combination with regional rivalry leave no room for complacency.
More broadly we are facing the prospect of a multipolar nuclear Middle East, linked 
AND
joined (23), unloosening both the demand and supply sides of proliferation.
On the supply side, &amp;#34;old style&amp;#34; proliferation relied on official cooperation between 
AND
national program, it began its transformation into an export-oriented venture.
Libya, Iran, North Korea and a fourth country which remains officially unnamed became 
AND
parades and test launches. Not all such cooperation consists of televised objects.
Even in the absence of game-changing breakthroughs, technical trends facilitate both demand 
AND
to make for a lighter and smaller more-readily deliverable weapons package.
In sum, incremental improvements increase the risk of proliferation. However, non-
AND
non-state device does not need to be as well-paved.
NUCLEAR FUTURES
~’New~’ lessons from a revisited past and current trends in nuclear proliferation, will tie into a number of characteristics of contemporary international relations with potentially destabilizing consequences, leading to an increasing likelihood of nuclear use. Four such characteristics will be singled out here both because of their relevance to nuclear crisis management and because of their growing role in the world system in the age of globalization:
- Strategic upsets
- Limits of imagination
- Unsustainable strains
- Radical aims
The 2008 French Defence and National Security White Paper (25) developed the concept 
AND
occasions for putting all crisis management, including nuclear, to the test.
Human societies tend to lack the imagination to think through, and to act upon
AND
the moral and strategic implications of the nuclear bombing of Japan in 1945.
Unsustainable strains are possibly the single most compelling feature of contemporary proliferation. Tight geographical 
AND
so deployed were not putting US and Soviet territory and capitals at risk.
It may be argued that these risk factors are known to potential protagonists and that 
AND
a fear which in turn fed into Soviet policies and dispositions (31).
The Cold War was a set of crises and misunderstandings which came within a whisker of a nuclear holocaust; India and Pakistan~’s nuclear standoff is deeply unstable not least as a result of the interaction with non-state actors; a multipolar nuclear Middle East would make the Cuban missile crisis look easy in comparison.

He studied chemistry at Sussex University, earning both a B.Sc and a Doctoral degree (D.Phil.); rising to become the youngest professor of physical chemistry in the U.K. at the age of 34. A prolific author, Chris has published more than 400 research and popular science articles (some in national newspapers: The Independent and The Daily Telegraph) He has recently published his first novel, &amp;#34;University Shambles&amp;#34; was published in April 2009 (Melrose Books), &amp;#34;Hopes Build for Thorium Nuclear Energy&amp;#34;, http://oilprice.com/Alternative-Energy/Nuclear-Power/Hopes-Build-for-Thorium-Nuclear-Energy.html-http://oilprice.com/Alternative-Energy/Nuclear-Power/Hopes-Build-for-Thorium-Nuclear-Energy.html~~ 

There is much written to the effect that thorium might prove a more viable nuclear fuel, and an energy industry based upon it, than the current uranium-based process which serves to provide both energy and weapons - including &amp;#34;depleted uranium&amp;#34; for armaments and missiles. There are different ways in which energy might be extracted from thorium, one of which is the accelerator-driven system (ADS). Such accelerators need massive amounts of electricity to run them, as all particle accelerators do, but these are required to produce a beam of protons of such intensity that until 10 years ago the prevailing technology meant that it could not have been done. As noted below, an alternative means to use thorium as a fuel is in a liquid fluoride reactor (LFR), also termed a molten salt reactor, which avoids the use of solid oxide nuclear fuels. Indeed, China has made the decision to develop an LFR-based thorium-power programme, to be active by 2020.¶ Rather like nuclear fusion, the working ADS technology is some way off, and may never happen, although Professor Egil Lillestol of Bergen University in Norway is pushing that the world should use thorium in such ADS reactors. Using thorium as a nuclear fuel is a laudable idea, as is amply demonstrated in the blog &amp;#34;Energy from Thorium&amp;#34; (http://thoriumenergy.blogspot.com/). However, the European Union has pulled the plug on funding for the thorium ADS programme, which was directed by Professor Carlo Rubbia, the Nobel Prize winner, who has now abandoned his efforts to press forward the programme, and instead concentrated on solar energy, which was another of his activities. Rubbia had appointed Lillestol as leader of the CERN physics division over two decades ago, in 1989, who believes that the cause is not lost.¶ Thorium has many advantages, not the least being its greater abundance than uranium. It is often quoted that there is three times as much thorium as there is uranium. Uranium is around 2 - 3 parts per million in abundance in most soils, and this proportion rises especially where phosphate rocks are present, to anywhere between 50 and 1000 ppm. This is still only in the range 0.005% - 0.1% and so even the best soils are not obvious places to look for uranium. However, somewhere around 6 ppm as an average for thorium in the Earth~’s crust is a reasonable estimate. There are thorium mineral deposits that contain up to 12% of the element, located at the following tonnages in Turkey (380,000), Australia (300,000), India (290,000), Canada and the US combined (260,000)... and Norway (170,000), perhaps explaining part of Lillestol~’s enthusiasm for thorium based nuclear power. Indeed, Norway is very well endowed with natural fuel resources, including gas, oil, coal, and it would appear, thorium.¶ An alternative technology to the ADS is the &amp;#34;Liquid Fluoride Reactor&amp;#34; (LFR), which is described and discussed in considerable detail on the http://thoriumenergy.blogspot.com/-http://thoriumenergy.blogspot.com/ blog, and reading this has convinced me that the LFR may provide the best means to achieve our future nuclear energy programme. Thorium exists naturally as thorium-232, which is not of itself a viable nuclear fuel. However, by absorption of relatively low energy &amp;#34;slow&amp;#34; neutrons, it is converted to protactinium 233, which must be removed from the reactor (otherwise it absorbs another neutron and becomes protactinium 234) and allowed to decay over about 28 days to uranium 233, which is fissile, and can be returned to the reactor as a fuel, and to breed more uranium 233 from thorium. The &amp;#34;breeding&amp;#34; cycle can be kicked-off using plutonium say, to provide the initial supply of neutrons, and indeed the LFR would be a useful way of disposing of weapons grade plutonium and uranium from the world~’s stockpiles while converting it into useful energy.¶ The LFR makes in-situ reprocessing possible, much more easily than is the case for solid-fuel based reactors. I believe there have been two working LFR~’s to date, and if implemented, the technology would avoid using uranium-plutonium fast breeder reactors, which need high energy &amp;#34;fast&amp;#34; neutrons to convert uranium 238 which is not fissile to plutonium 239 which is. The LFR is inherently safer and does not require liquid sodium as a coolant, while it also avoids the risk of plutonium getting into the hands of terrorists. It is worth noting that while uranium 235 and plutonium 239 could be shielded to avoid detection as a &amp;#34;bomb in a suitcase&amp;#34;, uranium 233 could not, because it is always contaminated with uranium 232, which is a strong gamma-ray emitter, and is far less easily concealed.¶ It has been claimed that thorium produces &amp;#34;250 times more energy per unit of weight&amp;#34; than uranium. Now this isn~’t simply a &amp;#34;logs versus coal on the fire&amp;#34; kind of argument, but presumably refers to the fact that while essentially all the thorium can be used as a fuel, the uranium must be enriched in uranium 235, the rest being &amp;#34;thrown away&amp;#34; and hence wasted as &amp;#34;depleted&amp;#34; uranium 238 (unless it is bred into plutonium). If both the thorium and uranium were used to breed uranium 233 or plutonium 239, then presumably their relative &amp;#34;heat output&amp;#34; weight for weight should be about the same as final fission fuels? If this is wrong, will someone please explain this to me as I should be interested to know?¶ However, allowing that the LFR in-situ reprocessing is a far easier and less dangerous procedure, the simple sums are that contained in 248 million tonnes of natural uranium, available as a reserve, are 1.79 million tonnes of uranium 235 + 246.2 million tonnes of uranium 238. Hence by enrichment 35 million tonnes (Mt) of uranium containing 3.2% uranium 235 (from the original 0.71%) are obtained. This &amp;#34;enriched fraction&amp;#34; would contain 1.12 Mt of (235) + 33.88 Mt of (238), leaving in the other &amp;#34;depleted&amp;#34; fraction 248 - 35 Mt = 213 Mt of the original 248 Mt, and containing 0.67 Mt (235) + 212.3 Mt (238). Thus we have accessed 1.79 - 0.67 = 1.12 Mt of (235) = 1.12/224 = 4.52 x 10*-3 or 0.452% of the original total uranium. Thus on a relative basis thorium (assuming 100% of it can be used) is 100/0.452 = 221 times as good weight for weight, which is close to the figure claimed, and a small variation in enrichment to a slightly higher level as is sometimes done probably would get us to an advantage factor of 250%21¶ Plutonium is a by-product of normal operation of a uranium-fuelled fission reactor. 95 to 97% of the fuel in the reactor is uranium 238. Some of this uranium is converted to plutonium 239 and plutonium 241 - usually about 1000 kg forms after a year of operation. At the end of the cycle (a year to 2 years, typically), very little uranium 235 is left and about 30% of the power produced by the reactor actually comes from plutonium. Hence a degree of &amp;#34;breeding&amp;#34; happens intrinsically and so the practical advantage of uranium raises its head from 1/250 (accepting that figure) to 1/192, which still weighs enormously in favour of thorium%21¶ As a rough estimate, 1.4 million tonnes of thorium (about one third the world uranium claimed, which is enough to last another 50 years as a fission fuel) would keep us going for about 200/3 x 50 = 3,333 years. Even if we were to produce all the world~’s electricity from nuclear that is currently produced using fossil fuels (which would certainly cut our CO2 emissions), we would be O.K. for 3,333/4 = 833 years. More thorium would doubtless be found if it were looked for, and so the basic raw material is not at issue. Being more abundant in most deposits than uranium, its extraction would place less pressure on other fossil fuel resources used for mining and extracting it. Indeed, thorium-electricity could be piped in for that purpose.¶ It all sounds great: however, the infrastructure would be huge to switch over entirely to thorium, as it would to switch to anything else including hydrogen and biofuels. It is this that is the huge mountain of resistance there will be to all kinds of new technology. My belief is that through cuts in energy use following post peak oil (and peak gas), we may be able to produce liquid fuels from coal, possibly using electricity produced from thorium, Thorium produces less of a nuclear waste problem finally, since fewer actinides result from the thorium fuel cycle than that from uranium. Renewables should be implemented wherever possible too, in the final energy mix that will be the fulcrum on which the survival of human civilization is poised.

2. ~’Resource Wars~’ and Conflict for Oil  Natural resources have always played a key role in conflicts and wars taking place. These struggles are often caused by the scarcity and immense value resources such as diamonds, copper, gold, water, timber, arable land, and oil ~~1~~. Among them, the role of petroleum as a vital commodity for the industrial world, and due to its global influences has been most remarkable, and as Yergin ~~8~~ noted, the history of petroleum has always been associated with the history of struggle and war. Indeed, &amp;#34;petroleum is unique among the world~’s resources&amp;#34; ~~1~~. There is this view that, the 21st century, similar to the previous century will be a &amp;#34;century of oil&amp;#34; and from this view, access to oil as a global resource has always included those issues that have formed battles ~~9~~. In fact, the new resource wars in the world will be a significant problem in the future. It will be because of the oil supply crisis as a natural resource. It will occur because of the declining oil reservoirs as well as the unbalanced distribution of these resources in particular along the North-South axis ~~4~~.  Billon ~~3~~ believes that the natural resources have always been introduced as a crucial motive of conflicts and wars. He refers to the more important role of these resources in creating wars in the 1990s and argues that some interventions take place because of the lust for valuable resources. He also believes that, on the other hand, the political and economic vulnerabilities of dependent countries on resources are the main reason for the importance of resources in creating wars. In this respect, the geopolitical thinking in the west, concerning resources, has been established over an equally strong relationship amongst power, trade, and war which has been tied strongly to maritime navigation and overseas resources too. In the past, this geopolitical thought had been reflected in the view that &amp;#34;whoever commands the oceans commands the trade of the world, and whoever commands the trade of the world commands the riches of the world, and whoever is master of that commands the world itself.&amp;#34; With growing dependence of the western countries on imported materials during the 19th century, indeed, great western countries expanded their command over raw materials throughout the world. In this commentary, some classic geopolitical concepts such as &amp;#34;vital space&amp;#34; or Lebensraum for accessing further resources and Mackinder~’s &amp;#34;Heartland&amp;#34; in warning about the role of railways in control of resources are very important ~~3~~.  Oil is the most significant overseas resource, and Billon ~~3~~, showed the key role it played during World War I and World War II. The vulnerability of those resources at that time was also revealed so that during the Cold War, ultimately, it was focused &amp;#34;on the vulnerability of rising resource supply dependence&amp;#34; which required various strategies to secure the needed resources in the forms of military deployments, accumulation of resources, diplomatic activities, coup d~’état, etc. ~~3~~. In this respect, four important events have also been mentioned by Billon, which have influenced the oil strategies and history; the decolonization process, Suez crisis in 1956, the 1973 Arab oil embargo, and the Islamic revolution of Iran in 1979. He also mentioned two important events, the end of the Cold War and the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, as events that increased the importance of energy security and vulnerability of these resources. Billon, on the other hand, indicates the necessity of energy security for the oil producer countries. For him, always one of the strategic http://astonjournals.com/assj  3 Arts and Social Sciences Journal, Vol. 2012: ASSJ-49  concerns for importing and exporting countries relates to geopolitics of energy security. In that regard, he also considers the natural resources revenues as a strong instrument to create wars in the post-Cold War era. This view is similar to Huntington~’s idea that oil-rich countries in the Persian Gulf became money-rich and then weapons-rich, and then, several wars finally occurred between Arab and Israel ~~10~~.  Peters ~~4~~, however, in his work &amp;#34;Coercive Western Energy Security Strategies: ~’Resource Wars~’ as a New Threat to Global Security,&amp;#34; explains the conditions of the Cold War era concerning resource wars and believes that, in 1986, a list of 12 wars and skirmishes in the 20th century was presented indicating that all were started by clashes over access to resources, renewable or non-renewable. For him, the 1991 Gulf War was the first interstate war on a major scale in the post-Cold War era, which was fought to control the oil of the region. From his view, oil is the most important non-renewable resources. In particular, it is a vital commodity in the industrial countries, with industrialized economies, particularly in agriculture and transportation sectors. As evidence, he refers to demand rates of consumer countries and indicates that demand is growing significantly and will continue to do so especially in the forthcoming decades such that in accordance with the international energy agency~’s (IEA) request for oil between 1997 and 2020 which is anticipated to rise with a growth rate of 1.9% per year ~~4~~.  In this respect and according to an international group of petroleum specialists (Association for the Study of Peak Oil, ASPO), researchers will witness the peak of world supply of oil in early 2010, and as a consequence, the energy prices will grow, and ultimately the world will face economic upheaval. Peters examines in fact, the resources conflict from the South–North perspectives and argues that 67.3% of all proven oil reservoirs has been covered by the G-77 and OPEC, and Arab league covers nearly 60% of world oil reservoirs. On the other hand, the demands of the developing countries are growing too. It is expected to rise almost three-fold as fast as in the developed world. It is estimated that from 43% for today to 55% of total global consumption by 2020. Therefore, conflict between South and North will be built over the distribution of energy resources among the energy-producing states and the energy-consuming states. There is, indeed, this view that, wars are generally the result of a multifaceted combination of motives, and the most important motivation is the concerns that are related to access and control of resources ~~4~~. It is interesting that Peters refers to two wars in the post-Cold War as &amp;#34;resource wars,&amp;#34; which were the result of the US coercive strategy in order to protect energy supplies.  In this respect, however, Singh refers to three wars in the Persian Gulf; two Iraq wars and the Afghanistan war that took place between two Iraq wars. He, in reference to the Afghanistan war, presents this question: &amp;#34;Is the NATO military presence in South-West Asia only to fight terrorism and introduce democracy or is there a hidden agenda like dominating the energy sources for the use of the west? Are they spending billions of dollars to maintain a large number of troops not only in Iraq but also in the neighborhood for political philanthropy, like establishing democracy, or is it an investment for energy security in the future?&amp;#34; ~~11~~. Singh, with reference to some studies emphasizes that bypassing the National Oil Company of Iraq in support of free market of oil was the aim of neo-conservatives, as it would reduce the domination of OPEC and other oil producers over the international oil market. He refers to production and consumption of oil for the period 1970–2003, and emphasizes the US dependency on foreign oil. He also stresses three significant issues: a continuous decrease in oil production, growing oil consumption, and as a result constantly rising dependence upon foreign imported oil. This increasing dependence has been shown to grow from 12.15% in 1970 to 43.7% in 1990 and to 65.1% in 2003. From this point of view, as the oil reserves of the US, South-East Asia and North Sea are declining; all the major consumers~’ dependence is increasing, especially on the Persian Gulf oil because of their future needs. This increase for the US is from 2.3 million barrels per day (mbd) in 2003 to 4.2 mbd by 2020. He also refers to declining oil production in the US from 9.5 mbd in 1970 to 6.72 mbd in 1994 and to 5.72 mbd in 2003. There is also decline in Norway, UK, and Indonesia. Clearly, the oil reservoirs and productions of the Persian Gulf area will increasingly be vital for global energy security because the decreasing oil production and limited reservoirs in the OECD states ~~11~~.  Another commentator, Klare ~~12~~ discusses three main resources in his work: energy resources (oil and natural gas), water, and valuable timber and minerals, and refers to the importance of these vital materials in the outbreak of conflicts across the world. Klare reveals his own worry about these conflicts and believes that it is a necessary issue to find and plan ways to resolve the issue of the competition over natural resources, because controlling specific natural resources is a national security theme of many countries and &amp;#34;something worth fighting for.&amp;#34; In this respect, he divides the reasons of conflicts after the Cold War to two periods and says that fighting in Central Africa, Kashmir, and the former Yugoslavia focused the global community on preventing ethnic conflict in the early 1990s, while in the next few years, violence in Africa occurred in the fight to control the copper mines, diamond fields, and farmlands. Concerning oil and gas, however, Klare pointed out the mechanism of supply and demand as the starting point of the pressure on http://astonjournals.com/assj  4 Research Article  energy reserves. He believes that increasing the populations and expanding the economic activities caused increasing need for vital materials, and demands for these materials, especially oil and gas, has always risen. Based on this viewpoint, &amp;#34;as shortages of critical materials rise in frequency and severity, the competition for access to the remaining supplies of these commodities will grow more intense&amp;#34; ~~12~~. He refers to a report of the US Department of Energy and declares that the world oil consumption will increase from about 77 mbd in 2000 to 110 mbd in 2020 (about 43%). In this condition, the world consumption will rise to approximately 670 billion barrels of oil only from 2000 till 2020. It means that it will include nearly two-thirds of the proven oil reservoirs of the world. In this respect, it seems that the production of petroleum will not be able to keep up with global demands and as a result the world will face an unbalanced global supply and demand ~~12~~.

ADVANTAGE ONE IS MANUFACTURING

Gas supply crunch inevitable now 
Nelder, 12 Chris, Smart Planet, February, Everything you know about shale gas is wrong, http://www.smartplanet.com/blog/energy-futurist/everything-you-know-about-shale-gas-is-wrong/341 

But now there’s even more bad news: U.S. gas production appears 
AND
end—like government—we’ll simply get the energy policy we deserve.

Natural gas prices will keep increasing despite flat consumption—that impacts sectors throughout the economy
Schwartzel, 13 Erich Schwartzel, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Expert on Fracking, visited Pappas’ Public Policy Class and was part of a round table discussion that consisted of Barry Rabe, professor at UM and others, really funny too, “U.S. report predicts rising natural gas prices in 2013-14”, http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/business/news/us-report-predicts-rising-natural-gas-prices-in-2013-14-669602/ 

The average price of natural gas is expected to increase by almost a dollar in 
AND
said suggests greater rig efficiency in extracting more gas from a single location.

And, shale gas is physically and economically unsustainable—continued reliance dashes expectations of future supply 
Heinberg, 10/22/12 Richard, He is Senior Fellow-in-Residence of the Institute and is widely regarded as one of the world’s foremost Peak Oil educators, He has authored scores of essays and articles that have appeared in such journals as Nature, The Ecologist, The American Prospect, Public Policy Research, Quarterly Review, Z Magazine, Resurgence, The Futurist, European Business Review, Earth Island Journal, Yes!, Pacific Ecologist, and The Sun; and on web sites such as Alternet.org, EnergyBulletin.net, TheOilDrum.com, ProjectCensored.com, and Counterpunch.com.¶ He has appeared in many film and television documentaries, including Leonardo DiCaprio’s 11th Hour, is a recipient of the M. King Hubbert Award for Excellence in Energy Education, and in 2012 was appointed to His Majesty the King of Bhutan&amp;#39;s International Expert Working Group for the New Development Paradigm initiative, “Gas Bubble Leaking, About to Burst”, http://www.postcarbon.org/blog-post/1262435-gas-bubble-leaking-about-to-burst 

In those early days almost no one wanted to hear about problems with the shale 
AND
millions of cars and trucks to run on gas, now ring hollow. 
And, that ensures catastrophic price spikes
Maize, 12/1/12 “Is Shale Gas Shallow or the Real Deal?”, Kennedy, Veteran Journalist¶ Kennedy Maize has spent the past 40 years working as a journalist, analyst, and manager in the private sector and federal government, with over 35 years of that focused on energy and environmental topics. Over that time, he has seen myriad examples of how group think, policy fads, and bad judgment can result in colossal failures, particularly in the field of atomic energy. Maize has seen, up close and personal, the demise of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, the arrival of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the birth of the U.S. Department of Energy, the failures of nuclear flight, the hubris of atomic earthmoving, the boom and bust uranium market, the birth and death of breeder reactors, and the 60-year wandering in the wilderness of nuclear waste policy. After graduating from Penn State and graduate study at the University of Maryland, Kennedy Maize worked for newspapers in Pennsylvania, New York, and Virginia and the Associated Press in Baltimore. He then spent five years in management at the National Institute of Health and the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission before taking a job covering energy, environment, and business topics for Editorial Research Reports, a division of Congressional Quarterly, where his work appeared in over 1,000 daily newspapers in the U.S. during the mid-to-late 1970s. Maize became a staff writer and editor at The Energy Daily, a preeminent energy trade paper, on March 28, 1979, the day the Three Mile Island accident began outside Harrisburg, Pa. Over more than 10 years at The Energy Daily, he covered the nuclear and coal industries, including stories involving the Clinch River Breeder Reactor, the U.S. Synthetic Fuels Corp., the Powder River Basin coal leasing scandal, and the Chernobyl explosion. In 1993, he founded The Electricity Daily, where he was the editor for 14 years, writing about changes in the electricity business, the rise and fall of Enron, the stagnation of the nuclear power business, and the arrival of market forces in the utility field. Since 2006, he has been an editor at POWER magazine, and the founder of MANAGING POWER magazine, where he has written about the Fukushima catastrophe, the emergence of shale gas and decline of coal, and the often ill-advised push for renewable electricity technologies¶ http://www.powermag.com/gas/Is-Shale-Gas-Shallow-or-the-Real-Deal_5188.html 

In an interview with POWER, Berman argued that the boom in drilling shale gas 
AND
be gas-coal switching if prices do go much higher than now.”

And, demand increases make a shock inevitable – corresponding supply key

A rise on the supply side would generally reduce prices, especially if the number 
AND
added demand will eliminate three times the current total gas in storage nationwide.¶ 

And, supply expansion locks in a competitive advantage

Expanded supply, coupled with low natural gas prices, has the potential to contribute 
AND
, would need to be changed to a more market-oriented method.
The impact is economic collapse—natural gas maintains growth

3 Energy Production and Mining
Definition: Threats from production of non-biological resources
Exposition: Various forms of water use (for example, dams for hydro power) could also be put in this class, but these threats seemed more related to other threats that involve alterations to hydrologic regimes. As a result, they should go in 7.2 Dams and Water Management/Use.
3.1 Oil and Gas Drilling
Definition: Exploring for, developing, and producing petroleum and other liquid hydrocarbons
Exposition: Oil and gas pipelines go into 4.2 Utility and Service Lines. Oil spills that occur at the drill site should be placed here; those that come from oil tankers or pipelines should go in 4. Transportation and Service Corridors or in 9.2 Industrial and Military Effluents, depending on your perspective.
Examples:
    oil wells
    deep sea natural gas drilling
3.2 Mining and Quarrying
Definition: Exploring for, developing, and producing minerals and rocks
Exposition: It is a judgment call whether deforestation caused by strip mining should be in this category or in 5.3 Logging and Wood Harvesting – it depends on whether the primary motivation for the deforestation is access to the trees or to the minerals. Sediment or toxic chemical runoff from mining should be placed in 9.2 Industrial and Military Effluents if it is the major threat from a mining operation.
Examples:
    coal strip mines
    alluvial gold panning
    gold mines
    rock quarries
    sand/salt mines
    coral mining
    deep sea nodules
    guano harvesting
    dredging outside of shipping lanes
3.3 Renewable Energy
Definition: Exploring, developing, and producing renewable energy
Exposition: Hydropower should be put in 7.2 Dams and Water Management/Use.
Examples:
    geothermal power production
    solar farms
    wind farms (including birds flying into windmills)
    tidal farms

Counter interp–production is the extraction or capture of energy from natural sources
DOCC 8 (Australian Government’s Department of Climate Change, “National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Guidelines,” http://www.climatechange.gov.au/government/initiatives/~/media/publications/greenhouse-report/nger-reporting-guidelines.ashx)
Energy Production
‘Energy production’ is defined in r. 2.23:
Production of energy, in relation to a facility, means any one of the following:
a. the extraction or capture of energy from natural sources for final consumption by or from the operation of the facility or for use other than in operation of the facility; 11
b. the manufacture of energy by the conversion of energy from one form to another form for final consumption by
or from the operation of the facility or for use other than in the operation of the facility.
Energy consumption
‘Energy consumption’ is defined in r. 2.23:
Consumption of energy, in relation to a facility, means the use or disposal of energy from the operation of the
facility including own-use and losses in extraction, production and transmission.

Over limiting – production is impossible without first locating a form of energy – limiting US to existing wells, means there are NO natural gas affs because of the offshore moratoria  - that causes affs that solely deal with shale, which no restrictions exist on and incentives don’t work given the tech is already economically viable

Aff innovation – our interp fosters creativity and discussions of key aspects of natural gas policy

Functional limits solve ground explosion – substantial, USFG and production guarantee links – our aff is at the core of the topic

 In international politics credibility is a prized asset. A country whose prom-

In contrast with Past Actions theory—which envisions leaders assessing credibility by peering into the past—Current Calculus theory posits that decisionmakers treat crises as if they were sui generis. If Current Calculus theory is correct, then countries do not need to take costly actions (such as fighting wars) to protect their future credibility. Future commitments will be credible if—and only if—they are backed up by sufficient strength and connected to weighty interests

Maize, 12/1/12“Is Shale Gas Shallow or the Real Deal?”, Kennedy, Veteran Journalist¶ Kennedy Maize has spent the past 40 years working as a journalist, analyst, and manager in the private sector and federal government, with over 35 years of that focused on energy and environmental topics. Over that time, he has seen myriad examples of how group think, policy fads, and bad judgment can result in colossal failures, particularly in the field of atomic energy. Maize has seen, up close and personal, the demise of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, the arrival of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the birth of the U.S. Department of Energy, the failures of nuclear flight, the hubris of atomic earthmoving, the boom and bust uranium market, the birth and death of breeder reactors, and the 60-year wandering in the wilderness of nuclear waste policy. After graduating from Penn State and graduate study at the University of Maryland, Kennedy Maize worked for newspapers in Pennsylvania, New York, and Virginia and the Associated Press in Baltimore. He then spent five years in management at the National Institute of Health and the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission before taking a job covering energy, environment, and business topics for Editorial Research Reports, a division of Congressional Quarterly, where his work appeared in over 1,000 daily newspapers in the U.S. during the mid-to-late 1970s. Maize became a staff writer and editor at The Energy Daily, a preeminent energy trade paper, on March 28, 1979, the day the Three Mile Island accident began outside Harrisburg, Pa. Over more than 10 years at The Energy Daily, he covered the nuclear and coal industries, including stories involving the Clinch River Breeder Reactor, the U.S. Synthetic Fuels Corp., the Powder River Basin coal leasing scandal, and the Chernobyl explosion. In 1993, he founded The Electricity Daily, where he was the editor for 14 years, writing about changes in the electricity business, the rise and fall of Enron, the stagnation of the nuclear power business, and the arrival of market forces in the utility field. Since 2006, he has been an editor at POWER magazine, and the founder of MANAGING POWER magazine, where he has written about the Fukushima catastrophe, the emergence of shale gas and decline of coal, and the often ill-advised push for renewable electricity technologies¶ http:~/~/www.powermag.com/gas/Is-Shale-Gas-Shallow-or-the-Real-Deal_5188.html

Shale gas has recently come onto the gas market in the US via use of &#xD;

Maize, 12/1/12 [“Is Shale Gas Shallow or the Real Deal?”, Kennedy, Veteran Journalist Kennedy Maize has spent the past 40 years working as a journalist, analyst, and manager in the private sector and federal government, with over 35 years of that focused on energy and environmental topics. Over that time, he has seen myriad examples of how group think, policy fads, and bad judgment can result in colossal failures, particularly in the field of atomic energy. Maize has seen, up close and personal, the demise of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, the arrival of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the birth of the U.S. Department of Energy, the failures of nuclear flight, the hubris of atomic earthmoving, the boom and bust uranium market, the birth and death of breeder reactors, and the 60-year wandering in the wilderness of nuclear waste policy. After graduating from Penn State and graduate study at the University of Maryland, Kennedy Maize worked for newspapers in Pennsylvania, New York, and Virginia and the Associated Press in Baltimore. He then spent five years in management at the National Institute of Health and the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission before taking a job covering energy, environment, and business topics for Editorial Research Reports, a division of Congressional Quarterly, where his work appeared in over 1,000 daily newspapers in the U.S. during the mid-to-late 1970s. Maize became a staff writer and editor at The Energy Daily, a preeminent energy trade paper, on March 28, 1979, the day the Three Mile Island accident began outside Harrisburg, Pa. Over more than 10 years at The Energy Daily, he covered the nuclear and coal industries, including stories involving the Clinch River Breeder Reactor, the U.S. Synthetic Fuels Corp., the Powder River Basin coal leasing scandal, and the Chernobyl explosion. In 1993, he founded The Electricity Daily, where he was the editor for 14 years, writing about changes in the electricity business, the rise and fall of Enron, the stagnation of the nuclear power business, and the arrival of market forces in the utility field. Since 2006, he has been an editor at POWER magazine, and the founder of MANAGING POWER magazine, where he has written about the Fukushima catastrophe, the emergence of shale gas and decline of coal, and the often ill-advised push for renewable electricity technologies http://www.powermag.com/gas/Is-Shale-Gas-Shallow-or-the-Real-Deal_5188.html] &#xD;

Miller 4 (Prof of Geology, 04 http://www.geosun.sjsu.edu/~jmiller/Geo1_Lecture12_SurfaceProcesses.html, 08-Dec-2004 EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES II: GROUNDWATER) 

Groundwater is extremely important because it is a source of clean drinkable water for human 
AND
one of the most pressing environmental issues faced by citizens the world over. 

So does air pollution
Driesen 2003 – Professor of Law, Syracuse, Buffalo Environmental Law Journal (David,, Fall, 2002 / Spring, 2003, p. LN) 

Air pollution can make life unsustainable by harming the ecosystem upon which all life depends 
AND
human health and the environment, air quality implicates both of these concerns. 

Soil depletion causes extinction

Complicating a solution to this problem is a dynamic that must be better understood in 
AND
we will have to produce an annual average of 25 tonnes per hectare.
Can we possibly boost output that much? Well, it’s been done before. Advances in the use of fertilizer and water, improved machinery and better tilling techniques combined to generate a threefold increase in yields since 1935 – on our farm back then, my dad produced 2.8 to 3 tonnes per hectare. Much US agriculture has seen similar increases.
But of course there is no guarantee that we can achieve those results again. 
AND
research will generate the innovations that will be necessary to feed the world.
The United States can take a leading position in a productivity revolution. And our success at increasing food production may play a decisive humanitarian role in the survival of billions of people and the health of our planet.

Small farms solve extinction

====Aesthetic considerations guide public opposition to wind power development – they~’re seen as ugly because they offend aesthetic norms for landscape and nature====

As studies by Warren et al. (2005) confirm, and others have 
AND
they are devices that are beyond the understanding and engagement of local inhabitants.


====Legal and political opposition is similarly informed by aesthetic criteria – upholding a beautiful landscape means opposing wind====

AND
turbines don~’t look so bad. In fact, they~’re kind of cute.

As with oil, gas and geothermal leasing, not all federal lands are available 
AND
of Critical Environmental Concern, may¶ not be suitable for development.173


====It~’s no accident that the Forest Service uses the phrase &amp;#34;scenic integrity.&amp;#34; Metanarratives of scenery dating back to the 16^^th^^ century label wind farms as ugly. This concept of scenery has its roots in transcendent ideals of beauty and their political implications====

AND

====This strategy is mirrored in current wind power debates – both sides think that their aesthetic perceptions of wind power are objectively correct====

And so we reach the same dialectical impasse that is¶ being reached across the 
AND
are having opposite experiences and¶ contradictory judgments. It~’s practically a paradox%21


====This political strategy of exclusion based on aesthetics mirrors the way that political practices operate – It~’s no surprise that the dominant group is the one that gets to affirm beauty – this has historically been used as a tool to marginalize other bodies ====
**Craig 2k6** (Maxine, &amp;#34;Race, beauty, and the tangled knot of a guilty pleasure&amp;#34; Feminist Theory 2006 7: 159)

Discourses of race and beauty are often intertwined. Racist ideologies commonly promote the appearance 
AND
a normalizing discourse that marks women of colour as abnormal and thus flawed.


====We repudiate strategies that apply beauty standards to political or social contexts, as it applies to wind, as it applies to energy, as it applies to politics, and as it applies to even interaction itself. ====


====Vote aff to affirm the politics of ugliness.====


====Beauty as a concept allows for exclusionary violence. Our rejection is a social function to reclaim aesthetics====

As femmes of color—however we identify—we have to push ourselves to

of the week. I would rather you be ugly—magnificently ugly.


====Beauty is defined by difference—it requires ugly as a condition of existence—this value structure manifests in intersecting forms of oppression====

http://www.humiliationstudies.org/documents/KuehneStrugglingforBeauty.pdf-http://www.humiliationstudies.org/documents/KuehneStrugglingforBeauty.pdf)

Beauty matters. That it matters can be easily measured by the amount of money 
AND
indicates wealth, health, and, in females, fertility and motherhood.


====Our engagement with ugliness should be understood within the context of unease with non-normative aesthetics – recognition of the POWER of ugliness pushes back against cultural norms of shunning – the 1ac isn~’t a reclaiming of beauty but rather an affirmation of ugly====
**Devereaux 2k5** (Mary, Ph.D., is a philosopher in the Research Ethics Program at the University of California, San Diego &amp;#34;The Ugly&amp;#34; http://www.aesthetics-online.org/articles/index.php?articles_id=24-http://www.aesthetics-online.org/articles/index.php?articles_id=24) 

Ugliness is a topic largely neglected by aestheticians. This neglect no doubt has many 
AND
some of the attention routinely bestowed on its more comely cousin, beauty.


====Even if beauty is good, we should reject its objective imposition – we identify, in solidarity with objects and beings marked as ugly alike====
**Craig 2k6** (Maxine, &amp;#34;Race, beauty, and the tangled knot of a guilty pleasure&amp;#34; Feminist Theory 2006 7: 159)

===Schlag===




====vote aff to affirm the imperfections of the 1AC against a cult of beauty – this is about the aesthetics of argument ====
Schlag, ~’2 ~~Pierre, Dheidt~’s Real Father/BFF and Byron White Professor of Law, University of Colorado School of Law, &amp;#34;Commentary:  The Aesthetics of American Law&amp;#34; 115 Harv. L. Rev. 1047~~

The various aesthetics, as suggested, are more or less conducive to various 
AND
or ethical view that is not at all conducive to one~’s own aesthetics.


===2ac at: performative pedagogy ===


====Performative pedagogy fails in the context of a competitive debate — there is no rigorous criteria for deciding whether or not we have sufficiently &amp;#34;performed&amp;#34; our pedagogy====
Medina and Perry ~’11 Mia, University of British Columbia, Carmen, Indiana University &amp;#34;Embodiment and Performance in Pedagogy Research: Investigating the Possibility of the Body in Curriculum Experience&amp;#34; Journal of Curriculum Theorizing Volume 27, Number 3, 2 http://www.academia.edu/470170/Embodiment_and_performance_in_pedagogy_The_possibility_of_the_body_in_curriculum
Jean-Luc Nancy (1994) reminds us that our endeavour to write about 
AND
, beyond this study, and beyond the modalities of written andvisual texts.


====The negative~’s performance of black perspectivism and the necessity of situated positionality is cooptes as an elite tool for immiseration — evaluate the debate as if the speakers are anonymous====
Gur-ze-ev, 98 - Senior Lecturer Philosophy of Education at Haifa, (Ilan, &amp;#34;Toward a nonrepressive critical pedagogy,&amp;#34; Educational Theory, Fall 48, http://haifa.academia.edu/IlanGurZeev/Papers/117665/Toward_a_Nonreperssive_Critical_Pedagogy-http://haifa.academia.edu/IlanGurZeev/Papers/117665/Toward_a_Nonreperssive_Critical_Pedagogy)

From this perspective, the consensus reached by the reflective subject taking part in the 
AND
-evident knowledge ultimately realized against the self-evidence of other groups.

===Root Cause ===

====Aesthetic exclusion is the root cause of racism====
**Pontynen 2k2** (Arthur, &amp;#34;THE AESTHETICS OF RACE VERSUS THE BEAUTY OF HUMANITY&amp;#34;
http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/700191/posts
There is no cultural issue more explosive today than race. It is a matter 
AND
of beauty, reality and life are purposeful and inherently infused with meaning.  

===Debate Key ===

====Public spaces are key – performative embrace of ugliness shapes the debate space through disrupting and deconstructing binaries existing in arguments and performances in the activity now ====
**Przybyło 2010** (Ela, currently completing a PhD in Women~’s Studies at York University, &amp;#34;The Politics of Ugliness&amp;#34; http://www.gla.ac.uk/media/media_180322_en.pdf-http://www.gla.ac.uk/media/media_180322_en.pdf) 

 Second, ugliness may be deployed strategically, through an  active and exaggerated performance 
AND
of pride:  as a site of presence, struggle, and endurance.


===New Aff~’s Lead to Uncertainty===

====The idea that our argument cannot and should not change—uncertainty and adapting your arguments is PART OF BEING UNCOMFORTABLE—their criticism of new affs is an independent voter because it trades off with our ability to STEP OUTSIDE OUR COMFORT ZONE by reading something like this====
Sholock 12 – Chatham University
(Adale, &amp;#34;Methodology of the Privileged: White Anti-racist Feminism, Systematic Ignorance, and Epistemic Uncertainty&amp;#34;, Hypatia Volume 27, Issue 4, pages 701–714, November 2012, dml)

However, something profound happens in The Color of Fear that troubles the epistemological arrogance 
AND
 (Collins 1986; Narayan 1989; Anzaldúa, 1987; Sandoval 2000).


===Disch===

====Our claim that you can~’t reduce our identity to a 9 minute speech is NOT the view from nowhere—they are the other side of the coin by claiming their anti-privilege gives them an a priori insight on reality====
DISCH ~’93 (Lisa J.; Professor of Political Theory – University of Minnesota, &amp;#34;More Truth Than Fact: Storytelling as Critical Understanding in the Writings of Hannah Arendt,&amp;#34; Political Theory 21:4, November)
What Hannah Arendt called &amp;#34;my old fashioned storytelling&amp;#34;7 is at once the 
AND
facts but to tell provocative stories that invite contestation form rival perspectives.15

===Subotnik===

====Don~’t be fooled—their authenticity tests are just as strategically motivated and self-serving as ours because we~’re both trying to WIN AN NDT debate—however, we have offense against their application of this as a reason they don~’t have to dispute the value of affirming ugliness====
Subotnik 1998 – professor of law, Touro College, Jacob D. Fuchsberg Law Center (7 Cornell J. L. %26 Pub. Pol~’y 681)

Having traced a major strand in the development of CRT, we turn now to 
AND
to faculty offices and, more generally, the streets and the airwaves.








===2ac taylor ===

====Regardless of the beneficial movement politics attached to their speech act the attempt to prioritize their own bodies through negation is deeply narcissistic. If you don&amp;#39;t have a clear idea of what saying no the aff means you should use the permutation as a concrete challenge to the canonization of aesthetic hierarchies. Identifying with the 1AC as a symbolic action to promote humane social orders is a reason to vote aff that should frame your ballot====
Taylor, ~’98 ~~Clyde R. Taylor, film scholar and literary/cultural essayist, is Professor at the Gallatin School and in Africana Studies, New York University. His publications include Vietnam and Black America and the script for Midnight Ramble, a documentary about early Black independent cinema.&amp;#34;The Mask of Art—breaking the aesthetic contract&amp;#34;~~ 

No form of discursive irony is more important to this analytical frame¬work than radical resistance
AND
this slave song exemplifies an early in¬stance of radical resistance to authorized truth.
