===AT Econ===
Growth is not a strong enough predictor of war to matter
Blackwill 2009 – former US ambassador to India and US National Security Council Deputy for Iraq, former dean of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard (Robert D., RAND, &amp;#34;The Geopolitical Consequences of the World Economic Recession—A Caution&amp;#34;, http://www.rand.org/pubs/occasional_papers/2009/RAND_OP275.pdf, WEA)

Did the economic slump lead to strategic amendments in the way Japan sees the world

And, diversionary war theory is false
Boehmer 2007 – political science professor at the University of Texas (Charles, Politics %26 Policy, 35:4, &amp;#34;The Effects of Economic Crisis, Domestic Discord, and State Efficacy on the Decision to Initiate Interstate Conflict&amp;#34;, WEA)

This article examines the contemporaneous effect of low economic growth and domestic instability on the

Even if those wars happen, they will be quick and insignificant
Bennett and Nordstrom 2000 – Department of Political Science at Penn State (Scott and Timothy, Journal of Conflict Resolution, &amp;#34;Foreign Policy Substitutability and Internal Economic Problems in Enduring Rivalries,&amp;#34; February 2000, EBSCO)

When engaging in diversionary actions in response to economic problems, leaders will be most

purposes, states should avoid conflict initiation against target states experiencing economic problems.

There is zero risk of a protectionist collapse
Anderson 9, head of Asia-Pacific Economics for UBS, (Jonathan, &amp;#34;Economist: Reality Check for Prophets of Protectionism,&amp;#34; 8-17, http://english.caijing.com.cn/2009-08-17/110225722.html) 

The short answer is no. We do not worry much about the protectionism issue
AND
perhaps longer. But we don~’t think the real situation supports these fears.


===Solar Industry===

The US solar industry is undergoing some serious growing pains, with bankruptcies and mergers 
AND
never intended to last forever. Solar companies must adapt or shut down.



===AT Bioterror===
The attack will never happen
Palmquist 2008 (Matt, &amp;#34;How and why the threat of bioterrorism has been so greatly exaggerated.&amp;#34; 5-19-08. http://www.miller-mccune.com/politics/bioterror-in-context-355)

This understanding of resilience and how it can be enhanced is  particularly important in light

Multiple alt causes for international hunger 
Shah, 08 http://www.globalissues.org/article/7/causes-of-hunger-are-related-to-poverty Causes of Hunger are related to Poverty Author and Page information by Anup Shah Last Updated Sunday, July 06, 2008

In a world of plenty, a huge number go hungry. Hunger is more

Resource wars won~’t escalate to great power conflict
Dombrowski 4 – associate professor, US Naval War College~’s Strategic Research Department (Peter, Naval War College Review, http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0JIW/is_1_57/ai_113755359/print)

The political danger of catastrophism is matched by the weakness of its scientific foundation.

Consequently, the best policy is to live with some modest climate change now and 
AND
reason to think environmental speculators won~’t be rewarded in the future, too.

===Uniqueness===

====The post-convention bounce is a measure of Democratic enthusiasm – it means the pool of likely Democratic voters will be higher====
Silver, 9/13/12 - statistician, author of FiveThirtyEight, one of Time~’s 100 most influential people (Nate, &amp;#34;[[Sept. 12: Polls Since Conventions Point to Decline in ~’Enthusiasm Gap~’-http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/13/sept-12-polls-since-conventions-point-to-decline-in-enthusiasm-gap/]],&amp;#34;
[[http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/-http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/]]

Why did President Obama get a bounce in the polls following the Democratic convention?
Part of it may simply be one of the functions that conventions have long served
AND
easy, especially in a year like this one with few undecided voters.


====Overall expectations about the economy are positive – this is mobilizing Democrats and boosting fundraising====
Easley, 9/11/12 (Jonathan, &amp;#34;Team Obama has post-convention glow,&amp;#34; The Hill, [[http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/248879-team-obama-has-post-convention-glow-http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/248879-team-obama-has-post-convention-glow]])

The Obama campaign has been flush with good news since the Democratic National Convention, 
AND
the economy per se, or heightened enthusiasm for the Democratic Party generally.&amp;#34;


====Most election models predict a narrow Obama win but it~’s reversible====
Klein, 9/11/12 – the editor of Wonkblog and a columnist at the Washington Post, as well as a contributor to MSNBC and Bloomberg(Ezra, Washington Post, &amp;#34;The economy (slightly) favors Obama, not Romney,&amp;#34;
[[http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/09/11/the-economy-slightly-favors-obama-not-romney/-http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/09/11/the-economy-slightly-favors-obama-not-romney/]]
I learned this the hard way. Some months ago, I worked with political 
AND
A slight lean towards Obama, but nothing that guarantees him a victory.


====Even GOP internal polls prove Romney is losing key swing states – and it~’s not a bounce====
Karl, 9/11/11 – ABC News~’ Senior Political Correspondent (Jonathan, &amp;#34;Republicans Nervously Eye Swing State Polls&amp;#34;, [[http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/09/republicans-nervously-eye-swing-state-polls/-http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/09/republicans-nervously-eye-swing-state-polls/]])
For Mitt Romney~’s campaign, the outlook in the battleground states is even worse than 
AND
the sense of gloom among top Republicans about the direction of the campaign.


====Momentum matters and it~’s against Romney====
Marlantes, 9/13/12 - Liz Marlantes covers politics for the Monitor and is a regular contributor to the Monitor~’s political blog (Liz, &amp;#34;On one issue, most Americans agree: They think President Obama will win&amp;#34;, Christian Science Monitor, [[http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/DC-Decoder/Decoder-Wire/2012/0913/On-one-issue-most-Americans-agree-They-think-President-Obama-will-win-video-http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/DC-Decoder/Decoder-Wire/2012/0913/On-one-issue-most-Americans-agree-They-think-President-Obama-will-win-video]])
Our sense is that when expectations are this consistent – when one candidate is viewed 
AND
media who are covering him. And that can have a deadly effect.
As we~’ve seen in recent days, Romney~’s bad decisions are often magnified as acts 
AND
lens, it creates a dynamic that seems to make winning even harder.

====Obama is promoting an &amp;#34;all of the above&amp;#34; energy strategy – this allows him to distance himself from prior renewables scandals.  The plan makes Obama a target and will cost him the election====
Farnam, 12 (T.W., Washington Post, 6/27, &amp;#34;Energy ads flood TV in swing states,&amp;#34;
[[http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/energy-ads/2012/06/27/gJQAD5MR7V_story.html-http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/energy-ads/2012/06/27/gJQAD5MR7V_story.html]]
Energy issues don~’t spark much excitement among voters, ranking below health care, education 
AND
for that sector, not simply for future government investment in that sector.&amp;#34;


====Obama needs a key energy policy to capitalize – perception of undelivered promises on energy====
**The Economist** 3-6-20**12**; The emerging energy consensus  [[http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2012/03/energy-and-election-http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2012/03/energy-and-election]]
Now, as for the candidates. Barack Obama would have a hard time campaigning 
AND
it~’s clear that neither party is offering a compelling vision on this issue.
