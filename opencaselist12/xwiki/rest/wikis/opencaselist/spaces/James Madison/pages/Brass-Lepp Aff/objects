However, there still remain some Republicans who are weary over the rapidly approaching deadline that Obama has mandated on immigration reform. Recently, six Republican senatorssent a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee-http://sessions.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?Fuseaction=Files.View%26FileStore_id=a3a628c4-94b2-43ea-b91f-982708d50849 urging them to allow legislators more time to read and analyze an immigration bill.
Recent word on a deal for the bill suggest that the panel and Congress have been at odds over exactly how to bring about a pathway to citizenship for millions of undocumented immigrants, with the senate panel insisting on issuing a path to citizenship only after the border is secure, which Obama insists is important, but told Univision that progress had already been made on tighter security at the southern border.
In addition, the AFL-CIO and U.S. Chamber of Commerce have been at odds over the contentious issue of how much immigrant workers should be paid, the union wanting higher wages than the chamber has agreed to.

About 63 percent of Americans agree that the immigration system should deal with immigrants who are currently living in the country by allowing them a way to become citizens, according to a survey released last Thursday by the Public Religion Research and the Brookings Institution.
However, a bad news for supporters of immigration reform is that among the seven issues with political priority for the White House and Congress, immigration only ranked sixth, far behind economic issues.

President Obama has challenged NASA to aim for a human mission to Mars in the 2030s after sending astronauts to visit an asteroid in 2025. To that end, NASA is developing new deep space vehicles as part of that effort, but the space agency is also facing proposed budget cuts to its planetary exploration program — and particularly future unmanned Mars projects.

The success of the Curiosity rover on Mars, however, could potentially help win support for future missions. NASA launched the rover in November 2011.
