Less intuitive is how ….ancillary to those views.

ADVANTAGE THREE GRID TECH
There is a huge push for microgrid technology in the status quo – ending restrictions and incentivizing decentralized energy would allow for the creation of extremely important microgird tech
Warner 2011
(Guy Warner, founder and CEO of Pareto Energy Decentralized Power and Disaster Preparation, “Microgrids, once considered a technology for off-grid communities, are emerging as a path toward disaster preparation,” APRIL 12, 2011, http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/decentralized-power-and-disaster-preparation, accessed 12/29/12, EGM)

There are also a host ….. attracted few disciples. 
Universities gladly permit such discourses by leftist academics, knowing that the proliferation of these discourses in the academy get co-opted by the sign economy and are graveyards for radical potential.

Edit
Chapter 1: A History of Dispossession

Exploration of the Americas …. dispossession continues today….

U.S. energy production policies are premised on the imposition of an epistemology of possession of the natural world.  This mode of relationality inherent within the paradigm of Settlerism is tantamount to ontological degradation and is responsible for the genocide of indigenous populations.

Wilderson 10 (Frank, MFA @ Columbia University in Fiction Writing, Ph.D. @ University of California, Berkeley in Rhetoric/Film Studies, Prof @ UC Irvine, Red, White, and Black: Cinema and the Structure of U.S. Antagonisms, p176-178shree)  

&amp;#34;Savage&amp;#34; sovereignty qua …. struggle to re-Indigenize the land. 

Genocidal assaults on indigenous populations set the foundation for serial policy failure in imperialist campaigns abroad—risks extinction.

Street 4 (Paul Street, phD in History from Binghamton, march 11, “Those Who Deny the Crimes of the Past,” http://www.zcommunications.org/those-who-deny-the-crimes-of-the-past-by-paul-street shree)

It is especially important …. who came to destroy. 

An analysis of oppression that neglects a paradigmatic analysis of indigenous genocide has failed to come to prior material conditions—indigenous criticism is the first priority

Churchill 3 (Ward, ex-Prof of Ethnic Studies @ U of Colorado, Acts of Rebellion: The Ward Churchill Reader, p 263-5shree)

I am here, …. its purported borders.

Thus, JMU MM endorses the resolution as a site of interrogation to analyze the historical paradigm of Settlerism that undergirds energy production in the United States.

Chapter 2:  Lay the West to Rest

Edit
We don’t defend the instrumental adoption of energy production—instead, we affirm the resolution as a locus to trace the lineage of political repugnancies in the U.S.

Churchill 3 (Ward, Acts of Rebellion: The Ward Churchill Reader, p. xv-xvii) PM

The question arises … than that made on 9-1-1. 

Debate is key—repudiation of Euro-American imperialism in academia helps establish modes of knowledge production that file away at systems of domination

Dei 2 (George Sefa, Professor of Sociology and Equity Studies@ Ontario Institute for Studies in Education of the University of Toronto, “Rethinking the Role of Indigenous Knowledges in the Academy,” The Research Network for New Approaches to Lifelong Learning, http://www.nall.ca/res/58GeorgeDei.pdf shree) 

Ultimately, we have …. and pedagogical practices.

Our advocacy stands in an antagonistic relation to civil society—any alternative that tries to take a middle ground is complicit.

Wilderson 10 (Frank, MFA @ Columbia University in Fiction Writing, Ph.D. @ University of California, Berkeley in Rhetoric/Film Studies, Prof @ UC Irvine, Red, White, and Black: Cinema and the Structure of U.S. Antagonisms, p6-7shree)  

Semiotics and linguistics …. and in political cinema?

The 1AC’s gesture towards impossible realism is productive—you should be skeptical of arguments refuting solvency for our method

Churchill 96 (Ward, ex-Prof of Ethnic Studies @ U of Colorado, “From a Native Son”, p.85-90shree)

The question which …. we all worked on attaining it? 

While each indigenous collective has different histories and traditions, strategic essentialism is key—reinforcing the common experience of Eurocentric domination is key to prevent atomization that mystifies the violence of colonialism

Churchill 8 (Ward, ex-Prof of Ethnic Studies @ U of Colorado, “I Am Indigenist,” November 18, http://www.zcommunications.org/i-am-indigenist-by-ward-churchill shree)

The manifestation of …. of Eurocentric domination.9

Policy Debate is skewed towards Western ways of knowing—it compartmentalizes arguments and privileges the “objectivity” of the line-by-line instead of viewing our speeches as an interconnected, coherent whole.  The idea that negs can “kick” arguments at any point in the debate is mired in an idea of neutral consensus building that crowds out an indigenization of the debate space

The atomistic conceptualizations ….the conflict (Burton 1996, 60–61). 

Unproblematized use of Western norms for conflict resolution commits ontological violence and trains us to be future colonizers
