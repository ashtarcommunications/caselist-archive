Beckman 2K (Tad, Prof. of philosophy at Harvey Mudd College, “Heidegger and Environmental Ethics”, http://www2.hmc.edu/~tbeckman/personal/HEIDART.HTML//shree)

Heidegger clearly saw the development of &amp;#34;energy

The technocratic disclosure of nature as standing-reserve is a rigged game—we are primed to interact with the world only as calculating machines.  That’s the precondition for nuclear war and sentences us to an eternity of counterfeit existence, purging value to life.

Ontological interrogation accesses the root cause of war
Burke ‘7 (Anthony, Senior Lecturer in Politics and International Relations at UNSW, Sydney, “Ontologies of War: Violence, Existence, and Reason”, The Johns Hopkins University Press, Project Muse//shree)

The danger obviously raised here is that these

tragically violent &amp;#39;choices&amp;#39; will continue to be made.


And, ontological damnation outweighs existence.  Death is the ground of freedom in life—our decisions have no meaning if they aren’t framed by human finitude.  Treating death as a mere even to be avoided cedes any capacity of freedom or choice to calculation.
Dillon 96 [Michael, professor Politics and International Relations at the University of Lancaster, The Politics of Security, pp. 82-84//shree]

Whereas tragic denial is willful blindness to this

No impact uniqueness—there’s no such thing as a unified Left—only a variety of movements against conservatism and neoliberalism.  And, turn—the argument that we divide the left brackets oppositional politics into ineffective strategies that collapse the left.

Further, the knowledge that being&amp;#39;s dispensation is

Technology is ontologically devastating, because it usurps

Burke 7 (Anthony Burke- Senior Lecturer in Politics and International Relations at UNSW, Sydney. Ontologies of War: Violence, Existence and Reason Theory and Event - Volume 10, Issue 2//shree)

 By itself, such an account of 
AND 
destruction of nature as much as its utilisation.


Vacuous Intellectualism DA—No amount of debate will ever solve their harms because the desire to have discussions about their impacts treats the symptoms and redistributes power, but fails to address the root cause of managerial thinking.  And, it turns case—communities find their bonding in repeated assurances to absolve their guilt by pontificating about the suffering of others, resulting in rituals of intellectual pleasure that maintain devitalizing designs of everyday interpassivity.
Scott 90 (Charles E.; Edwin Erle Sparks Professor of Philosophy at Pennsylvania State University; The Question of Ethics; Indianapolis: Indiana University Press; 1990; p. 111-118//shree) 

We all know what suffering is when we

Psychoanalysis is crucial to interrogate the persistence of hegemonic [anti-blackness/heteronormativity/patriarchy]—frontal approaches alone cannot solve&#xD;

Armchair Activism DA—Universities gladly permit such discourses by leftist academics, knowing that the proliferation of these discourses in the academy get co-opted by the sign economy and are graveyards for radical potential.  &#xD;

What is particularly interesting about these modern-&#xD;

before us and admonish it with full vigour. &#xD;
&#xD;
Desiring Whiteness DA – race as a system perpetuates itself on the basis of racial identification, ensuring their method fails because it ignores the broader desire for Whiteness and a separation from it.

The question arises of how best to approach &#xD;
AND &#xD;
that made on 9-1-1. &#xD;
2NC&#xD;
(1)  Energy Focus DA—reforms in domestic energy production miss the forest for the trees—the original conquest of America is the founding antagonism that undergirds all episodic violence by ontologically imposing Settlerist notions of possession.  The very idea of resource management assumes that Settlers have the right to own and mine nature—this materialistic, domineering relationship actively erases indigenous ways that are based on an unalienated stewardship that refuses to accept the uncritical use and disposal of the land and entities within it—this constitutes the auto-genocide of natives—that’s Wilderson.   Even if legalism in the abstract is justified, the cultural context of materialism that founds energy reform is not &#xD;

AND &#xD;
in the European historical and cultural context.&amp;#34; 16 &#xD;
(2)  Sequencing issue:  It’s try-or-die—historical ignorance leads to serial policy failure on a global scale—not confronting the crimes of the past emboldens and accelerates imperialist campaigns abroad that results in the re-entrenchment of structural violence and extinction—that’s Street.  The alt is the first priority and the very existence of the U.S. makes their impacts possible&#xD;

&#xD;
I am here, however, as may &#xD;
AND &#xD;
to every indigenous nation within its purported borders.&#xD;
(3)  Legal Colonialism DA—Reformist assurances to help natives in the U.S. have just resulted in assimilation and annihilation of 90% of the indigenous population—even if their arguments sound good in theory, they just result in Washington sending hacks from the military industrial complex to dissolve native struggles in practice.&#xD;

Moreover, there are some issues and concerns &#xD;
AND &#xD;
politics, about power and ultimately about morality.&#xD;

choice and therefore subject to human control. 12 &#xD;

… practice is willing to dance.
The alternative is Heideggerian destruction. Heideggerian destruction retrieves the question of temporality and better attends to the present. Our destructive approach does not textualize or depoliticize difference but attends to difference as one site along a continuum of being.
