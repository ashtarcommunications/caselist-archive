===Ad ONE===

Nuclear terror: 

====Too many obstacles to overcome – even if overcoming isn~’t impossible – even generous odds ensure the chances of success are 1 in 3 billion statistically – small enough to vote on presumption====
John **Mueller** (Woody Hayes Chair of National Security Studies, Mershon Center, and is professor of Political Science, at Ohio State University) **2010** &amp;#34;Atomic Obsession: Nuclear Alarmism from Hiroshima to Al Qaeda&amp;#34; p. 197-8
As Allison appropriately points out, it is important to consider not only the likelihood 
AND
or even lower than, those for a thermonuclear attack from Russia.~’

====This ensures terrorists wont have the motivation====
Michael A. **Levi** (Fellow for Science and Technology) 4/19/**2007** &amp;#34;How Likely is a Nuclear Terrorist Attack on the United States?&amp;#34;, Council on Foreign Relations, http://www.cfr.org/publication/13097/
Yet from a terrorist perspective the prospect of a fizzle or a dud might change 
AND
no reason to assume that al-Qaeda would choose such a course.

====Cant build one====
John **Mueller** (Woody Hayes Chair of National Security Studies, Mershon Center, and is professor of Political Science, at Ohio State University) **2010** &amp;#34;Atomic Obsession: Nuclear Alarmism from Hiroshima to Al Qaeda&amp;#34; p. 173-4
Some observers have insisted that it would be &amp;#34;easy&amp;#34; for terrorists to assemble 
AND
is jU. processed:~’ and both require special machining technology.4


Prolif: 



====Robust statistical studies prove prolif decreases war and escalation====
Victor **Asal** **and** Kyle **Beardsley**, pub. date: **2007**, Assistant Prof. Pol. Sci. – SUNY Albany, and Kyle Beardsley, Asst. Prof. Pol. Sci. – Emory Univ., Journal of Peace Research, &amp;#34;Proliferation and International Crisis Behavior,&amp;#34; accessed: 12-18-09, http://jpr.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/44/2/139  
The literature on international conflict is divided on the impact of nuclear proliferation on state 
AND
a crisis can prevent war, and they cannot speak to other proliferation risks 


====No cascade of proliferation – its historically wrong and based on alarmist predictions – China, India, Pakistan, North Korea, Iran, South Africa, Libya all pursued nuclear weapons and none caused a cascade.  Prefer our evidence - their lit base is all lobbyist scaremongering ====
Steve **Kidd** (Director of Strategy %26 Research at the World Nuclear Association, where he has worked since 1995 (when it was the Uranium Institute)) June **2010** &amp;#34;Nuclear proliferation risk – is it vastly overrated?&amp;#34; http://www.waterpowermagazine.com/story.asp?sc=2056931
The real problem is that nuclear non-proliferation and security have powerful lobby groups 
AND
fuel cycle are unwarranted, particularly if they impose additional costs on the industry

====Prefer our evidence – it~’s the only one based on robust empirical studies====
Victor **Asal** **and** Kyle **Beardsley**, pub. date: **2007**, Assistant Prof. Pol. Sci. – SUNY Albany, and Kyle Beardsley, Asst. Prof. Pol. Sci. – Emory Univ., Journal of Peace Research, &amp;#34;Proliferation and International Crisis Behavior,&amp;#34; accessed: 12-18-09, http://jpr.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/44/2/139  
Much of the literature on the impact of nuclear weapons does not empirically test the 
AND
nuclear attack will be more willing to concede or back down from violent conflict

CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Get ready for an all-out brawl 
AND
newspapers around the country, here~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~’s a state-by-state look:






====Nuclear Power Controversial: Waste Concerns====
Steve ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~[~~~~~~~~~~~~~~[Hargreaves-mailto:steve.hargreaves@turner.com~~~~~~~~~~~~~~]~~~~~~~~~~~~~~] 8-9-2012 Nuclear waste issues freeze permits for U.S. power plantshttp://money.cnn.com/2012/08/09/news/economy/nuclear-plants-waste/index.htm
The U.S. government said it will stop issuing permits for new nuclear 
AND
at 64 plants across the country. Half are over 30 years old. 


**====Nuclear energy incentives cause backlash – especially true with Obama ====**

====The current defined uranium base is high enough to meet demand well into the future.====
**IAEA.**org, Global Uranium Supply Ensured for Long Term, New Report Shows 26 July **2012 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~[~~~~~~~~~~~~~~[**http://www.iaea.org/newscenter/pressreleases/2012/prn201219.html-http://www.iaea.org/newscenter/pressreleases/2012/prn201219.html~~~~~~~~~~~~~~]~~~~~~~~~~~~~~]~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~| 
Uranium resources and production are on the rise with the security of uranium supply ensured

==Impact==

===Israel Attack===

====Attacking Iran leads to lash out against Israel which pulls in US and leads to regional instability ====
Logan, foreign policy analyst and member of the Coalition for a Realistic Foreign Policy, 2007
(Justin, USA Today, March, ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~[~~~~~~~~~~~~~~[http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=8180-http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=8180~~~~~~~~~~~~~~]~~~~~~~~~~~~~~] gjm)
Another worry is the potential for Iran to lash out against Israel. Mohammad-
AND
an attack by one of them as an act of war by both.
The recent violence in Lebanon and northern Israel has underscored another potential Iranian tactic: 
AND
civilians, Hezbollah was able to avoid defeat against the elite Israeli military.
Presumably, if Iran were under attack, Hezbollah would be deployed more fully against Israel, inflicting much more damage than did its recent tactics. If Iran were to assault Israel directly, the U.S. could find itself in a similar situation to the predicament during the first Gulf War, attempting to keep Israel out of a conflict for fear that its involvement could cause the war to escalate and spread throughout the region. 



===Impact: Laundry List===

====The attack would be the worst thing ever – global terrorism, war with Russia, and war with China would ensue====
**Ullah, ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~’6**  Head of Independent Centre of Strategic Studies (Canada, Ottawa).
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~[Abid, 2/20/06, http://mathaba.net/0_index.shtml?x=528456~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~]
If Iran has no nuclear weapons, as concludes Mohammed el-Baradei the respected 
AND
far worse than what the title &amp;#34;World War 3&amp;#34; can convey.  

====US/China war causes extinction.====
**Straits Times -2K** (Straits Times, June, 25, 2000, No one gains in war over Taiwan~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~] (PDNSS2115)
THE DOOMSDAY SCENARIO -THE high-intensity scenario postulates a cross-strait war 
AND
cannot be ruled out entirely, for China puts sovereignty above everything else.

====US-Russia nuclear war causes extinction====
The **American Prospect**, 2/26/**01 **
The bitter disputes over national missile defense (NMD) have obscured a related but 
AND
would be, basically, a nuclear war by checklist, by rote.&amp;#34;

====Unchecked terrorism will result in extinction====
Yonah **Alexander**, professor and director of the Inter-University for Terrorism Studies in Israel and the United States. &amp;#34;Terrorism myths and realities,&amp;#34; The Washington Times, August 28, **2003**
Unlike their historical counterparts, contemporary terrorists have introduced a new scale of violence in 
AND
the road may be: For without victory, there is no survival.&amp;#34;
