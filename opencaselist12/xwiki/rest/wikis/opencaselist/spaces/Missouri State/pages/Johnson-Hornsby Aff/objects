===Advantage One: Fissile Material===


====Rapid cascade proliferation at the tipping point for causing global nuclear war.====
Graham Allison, January/February 2010, Director of Harvard~’s major Center for Science and International Affairs, as for three decades been a leading analyst of U.S. national security and defense policy with a special interest in nuclear weapons, terrorism, and decision-making, Assistant Secretary of Defense in the first Clinton Administration, Defense Medal for Distinguished Public Service, Organizer of the Commission on America~’s National Interests, Foreign Policy, &amp;#34;Nuclear Disorder,&amp;#34; Ebsco Host
THE GLOBAL nuclear order today could be as fragile as the global financial order was 
AND
war so imminent that prudent statesmen must do everything feasible to prevent it.

==== 
Those who acquire nuclear weapons don~’t do it for reasons of security and deterrence – Waltz is wrong.====
Christopher Bluth, 7-11-2011, work is in international security,

If ~’trusting relationships~’ are fundamental to the dynamic of the NPT, then the

====Central question of the nonproliferation regime is disposal of nuclear fuel not solving will undercut the global nuclear order.====

U.S. fast reactors and pyro-processing is key to reinvigorating nuclear leadership – Korea proves.====

The benefit of a fast reactor recycling program could be the reduction or near elimination
