Text: the United States Department of Defense should substantially increase fixed price contracts for nuclear energy produced by additional naval aircraft carriers.

Contention 1: The Carrier Gap
First, The Navy just spent billions on new carriers, but the carrier schedule is stalled
O’Rourke 7/26, Ronald O&amp;#39;Rourke has a M.A. in international studies and is a naval specialist for the Congressional Research Service, “Navy Ford (CVN-78) Class Aircraft Carrier Program: Background and Issues for Congress” http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/weapons/RS20643.pdf
The carrier force will drop… and the commissioning of CVN-78.

Second, This schedule creates a severe shortfall- The fleet will be stuck with an unprecedented low of ten carriers for half a decade
Eaglen, Senior Policy Analyst for National Security at the Heritage Foundation, 2k8 (Mackenzie, Aug 1st, “Aircraft Carriers Are Crucial”, The Washington Post)
To maintain 11 carriers, the Navy… Ford to the 2013-2014 timeframe.

AND, Maintenance cycles means that less than 10 carriers are deployed. This kills effectiveness.
Erdossy 7/17-Marty Erdossy is the former Commanding Officer of the USS George Washington (CVN 73).
“Why Does The United States Only Have Eleven Aircraft Carriers?”
Typical maintenance periods range… of operations and maintenance.
This is especially true with rising tensions with Iran

http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/07/20/this_week_at_war_if_you_build_up_who_will_come?page=0,1
Pentagon spokesman George Little said… certainly headed higher. 

AND, unless new carriers are built, US will inevitably over-commit.
Haddick, ‘12
Robert Haddick, contractor at U.S. Special Operations Command, editor of Small Wars Journal, and former Marine Corps; “This Week at War: Does the U.S. Need More Aircraft Carriers?” 5/25/2012; http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/05/25/this_week_at_war_does_the_us_need_more_aircraft_carriers
A May 21 article in the… Asia-Pacific theater sounding hollow.

AND, Their disads are non-starters. The Navy just increased spending for carriers
Capaccio 8/5-writer for Bloomberg, “Huntington Risks Losing $194 Million on Navy Carrier Cost”

The company would receive…Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC) in March 2011. 

Contention 2 is Sea Power:
Carriers provide unmatched firepower and survivability- that’s key to military dominance
Allen, Retired Vice Admiral and former Commander of Naval Air Forces of the Atlantic Fleet, 2k1 (Richard, “Aircraft carriers and sea-based air power: Smaller is not better and numbers do count!,” Sea Power, June)
Today, the 15 CVBG/14 CVW/600-ship… nation&amp;#39;s allies around the world.

And, Naval power is the very foundation of U.S. hegemony. American dominance invisibly deters myriad challengers and conflicts
Friedman, founder, CEO, and chief intelligence officer of Stratfor, 2k7 (George, April 10th, “The Limitations and Necessity of Naval Power”, http://www.stratfor.com/limitations_and_necessity_naval_power)

First, although hegemonic decline… accordance with Ikenberry&amp;#39;s prescription.

The alternative is net worse. The transition entails global chaos and conflict – multipolrity can never exist.
Brzezinski 05 National Security Advisor in the Carter Administration, Professor of Foreign Policy @ Johns Hopkins University (Zbigniew &amp;#34;The Choice&amp;#34;)
History is a record of change… stabilizer will also endure. 

And, Carriers solve- A robust fleet prevents crisis escalation
Eaglen, Senior Policy Analyst for National Security at the Heritage Foundation, 2k8 (Mackenzie, Aug 1st, “Aircraft Carriers Are Crucial”, The Washington Post)
For any U.S. president… maintain at least 12 carriers.

The gradual decline of the Navy will leave a vacuum culminating in major power competition and global war.  A strong navy ensures global stability even through a land defeat.
Robert D. Kaplan November 2007 Atlantic Monthly, national correspondent for The Atlantic, is the Class of 1960 Distinguished Visiting Professor in National Security at the U.S. Naval Academy, http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200711/america-decline/3

Will the U.S. go to war… the run-up to World War II

A space-based radar concept is currently in work at an Air Force Research Laboratory. It requires large amounts of electrical power and the engineers have found no optimum solution to the problem.31 The space-based radar in use today is limited in resolution and coverage by on orbit power.32  As with the space-based laser and RF jamming device, a space-based radar receiving power from a solar power satellite eliminates this problem. 

Space-based radar is key to effective missile defense
