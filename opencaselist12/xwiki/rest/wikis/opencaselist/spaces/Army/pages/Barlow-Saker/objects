Contention 1: The Carrier Gap
First, The Navy just spent billions on new carriers, but the carrier schedule is stalled
O’Rourke 7/26, Ronald O&amp;#39;Rourke has a M.A. in international studies and is a naval specialist for the Congressional Research Service, “Navy Ford (CVN-78) Class Aircraft Carrier Program: Background and Issues for Congress” http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/weapons/RS20643.pdf
The carrier force will drop… and the commissioning of CVN-78.


Second, This schedule creates a severe shortfall- The fleet will be stuck with an unprecedented low of ten carriers for half a decade 
Eaglen, Senior Policy Analyst for National Security at the Heritage Foundation, 2k8 (Mackenzie, Aug 1st, “Aircraft Carriers Are Crucial”, The Washington Post) 
To maintain 11 carriers, the Navy… Ford to the 2013-2014 timeframe.


AND, Maintenance cycles means that less than 10 carriers are deployed. This kills effectiveness.
Erdossy 7/17-Marty Erdossy is the former Commanding Officer of the USS George Washington (CVN 73).
“Why Does The United States Only Have Eleven Aircraft Carriers?”
Typical maintenance periods range… of operations and maintenance.
This is especially true with rising tensions with Iran
Foreign Policy 7/20-“This Week at War: If You Build Up, Who Will Come?”
http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/07/20/this_week_at_war_if_you_build_up_who_will_come?page=0,1
Pentagon spokesman George Little said… certainly headed higher. 


AND, unless new carriers are built, US will inevitably over-commit.
Haddick, ‘12
Robert Haddick, contractor at U.S. Special Operations Command, editor of Small Wars Journal, and former Marine Corps; “This Week at War: Does the U.S. Need More Aircraft Carriers?” 5/25/2012; http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/05/25/this_week_at_war_does_the_us_need_more_aircraft_carriers
A May 21 article in the… Asia-Pacific theater sounding hollow.


AND, Their disads are non-starters. The Navy just increased spending for carriers
Capaccio 8/5-writer for Bloomberg, “Huntington Risks Losing $194 Million on Navy Carrier Cost”
http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-04-05/huntington-risks-losing-194-million-for-navy-carrier-s-overrun.html
The company would receive…Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC) in March 2011. 


Contention 2 is Sea Power:
Carriers provide unmatched firepower and survivability- that’s key to military dominance 
Allen, Retired Vice Admiral and former Commander of Naval Air Forces of the Atlantic Fleet, 2k1 (Richard, “Aircraft carriers and sea-based air power: Smaller is not better and numbers do count!,” Sea Power, June) 
Today, the 15 CVBG/14 CVW/600-ship… nation&amp;#39;s allies around the world.


And, Naval power is the very foundation of U.S. hegemony. American dominance invisibly deters myriad challengers and conflicts 
Friedman, founder, CEO, and chief intelligence officer of Stratfor, 2k7 (George, April 10th, “The Limitations and Necessity of Naval Power”, http://www.stratfor.com/limitations_and_necessity_naval_power) 
The argument for slashing the… foremost, a maritime power.


The impact is Kagan—Enough Said
Kagan, 2007 (Robert, Senior Associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, “End of Dreams, Return of History” Policy Review, http://www.hoover.org/publications/policyreview/8552512.html#n10)
Finally, there is the United States itself… will provide an easier path. 


Heg Bad isn’t an argument. Obama makes intervention inevitable 
Kagan 7 (Robert, senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund) http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/27/AR2007042702027.html
America must &amp;#34;lead… a left-liberal foreign poli


Theoretical arguments about inevitable decline create a self-fulfilling prophecy- even if collapse is inevitable, we should attempt to sustain it
Schweller &amp;#39;1 Associate Professor of Political Science at Ohio State University Randall L. &amp;#34;The Problem of International Order Revisited&amp;#34; International Security, 26.1 (Project Muse)
First, although hegemonic decline… accordance with Ikenberry&amp;#39;s prescription.


The alternative is net worse. The transition entails global chaos and conflict – multipolrity can never exist. 
Brzezinski 05 National Security Advisor in the Carter Administration, Professor of Foreign Policy @ Johns Hopkins University (Zbigniew &amp;#34;The Choice&amp;#34;)
History is a record of change… stabilizer will also endure. 


And, Carriers solve- A robust fleet prevents crisis escalation 
Eaglen, Senior Policy Analyst for National Security at the Heritage Foundation, 2k8 (Mackenzie, Aug 1st, “Aircraft Carriers Are Crucial”, The Washington Post) 
For any U.S. president… maintain at least 12 carriers.


The gradual decline of the Navy will leave a vacuum culminating in major power competition and global war.  A strong navy ensures global stability even through a land defeat.
Robert D. Kaplan November 2007 Atlantic Monthly, national correspondent for The Atlantic, is the Class of 1960 Distinguished Visiting Professor in National Security at the U.S. Naval Academy, http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200711/america-decline/3
“Regular wars” between major… our elites appear blind. 

Contention 3 is Air Power—
The political will and focus of Air Force leaders is killing American air dominance.
Goure 2010-Daniel, Ph.D., “Say Goodbye To U.S. Air Dominance ~-~- And Perhaps To Victory In The Next War” http://www.lexingtoninstitute.org/say-goodbye-to-us-air-dominance~-~-~-~-and-perhaps-to-victory-in-the-next-war?a=1andc=1171

AND, Carriers are the bread and butter of our air power strategy. Missions are launched and sustained by carrier air wings. Prefer most recent applications.

Operation Enduring Freedom ... complete the mission.6


Additionally, conventional air power is restricted by bases that our threatened. Carriers provide unmatched mobility.

Subpoint  B is Jamming Systems:
Only carriers have jamming systems that can engage in electronic warfare but shortages means commanders have to “gap-fill” land sites.

Carriers are key to strategic success in amorphous operations. Failure assures allies lashout and force reversion of strategy. Only the plan can access sustainability

A war with China is inevitable—ASB means war now would be won by the United States and be a small conflict. Delaying the inevitable results in a future war that will escalate to nuclear extinction

Will the U.S. go to war… the run-up to World War II



History is on our side – every nation that has ever come to global power has always done so through massive transition war; China will be no different, they are a threat, and they will always perceive us as THE enemy no matter how much you hippies don’t want them to.
Kagan 05 (Robert, senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Washington, “The Illusion of ‘Managing’ China”, lexis) 
The history of rising powers,… many tragic lessons of history.



A war with China must happen in the status quo in order to maintain United States hegemony – war now would easily be won by the United but Carrier groups are key
Ross 05 – Prof Poly Science Boston College, (Robert Assessing the China Threat National Interest  Fall, http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2751/is_81/ai_n15753420/print)

You should prefer war now. First, China only has a few working nukes

In the 1990s, with the Cold War receding… notice of an incoming attack.



Second, they wouldn’t use them

The US-Russia treaty is being eagerly watched by other nuclear powers. 
China on Thursday urged… circumstances and at any time.&amp;#34;

Additionally, striking now would eliminate their arsenal
Lieber and Press, 9 (Keir A.,  Associate Professor @ Georgetown University,  Daryl G., Associate Professor of Government, Dartmouth College, Foreign Affairs, Nov/Dec)
MODELING THE UNTHINKABLE To illustrate… give a U.S. president real options.

The window of opportunity is closing— China is modernizing its nuclear forces now 
Gill, phd, Director of SIPRI, 10 Bates, “CHINA AND NUCLEAR ARMS CONTROL: CURRENT POSITIONS AND FUTURE POLICIEs” , http://books.sipri.org/files/insight/SIPRIInsight1004.pdf 
Nonetheless, China is in.. important in this regard

China’s main focus of modernization is ASAT technology

As part of this modernization… support them,&amp;#34; he said.
