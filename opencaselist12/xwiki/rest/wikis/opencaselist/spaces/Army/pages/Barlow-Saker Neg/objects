===2NC China===
Continuation of US primacy causes conflict with China because China disagrees with US ideas and don~’t want to be militarily inferior to us – tensions will result in a backlash and attempts by China to balance the US – this outweighs.
A. Magnitude – China war would set East Asia on fire and trigger other nuclear wars – like between India %26 Pakistan – that~’s Hunkovic.

What would happen if China launched its 20 Dongfeng-5 intercontinental ballistic missiles, 
AND

B. Probability—As China rises, it will need a regional sphere of influence
Ivan Eland, 1/18/06 - Senior Fellow and Director of the Center on Peace %26 Liberty at The Independent Institute, PhD in National Security from George Washington University, Director of Defense Policy Studies at the Cato Institute. (The Independent Institute. &amp;#34;Is future conflict with China unavoidable?&amp;#34; http://www.independent.org/pdf/working_papers/63_china.pdf )
If rapid economic growth does continue, however, it will probably cause China to want more inﬂuence at least around its periphery (East Asia and maybe South, Southeast, and Southwest Asia). Throughout history, most great powers, as they acquired more strength, have attempted to enhance their security by creating a sphere of inﬂuence over smaller states in their &amp;#34;near abroad.&amp;#34; Because of China~’s history of being carved up by foreign powers in the 1800s, it is especially sensitive to the need to acquire such a security buﬀer. To create a sphere of inﬂuence, many great powers that expand their economies also increase their defense budgets. China has been doing so in recent years, but military modernization remains the last of its modernization priorities. Taking a lesson from the fall of the Soviet Union, the astute Chinese leadership emphasizes economic growth (that is, long term national power) over improving military strength (short-term power).

Heg interferes with it
**Carpenter 10**—vice president for defense and foreign policy studies at the Cato, Ph.D. in U.S. diplomatic history from the University of Texas (Ted Galen, 19 October 2010, &amp;#34;Resets and Spheres of Influence&amp;#34;, http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-skeptics/resets-spheres-influence-4266-http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-skeptics/resets-spheres-influence-4266, RBatra)
The Obama administration has explicitly sought to &amp;#34;reset&amp;#34; the relationship with Russia, which had become quite dysfunctional during the final years of the Bush administration. Although Washington has not used the reset terminology with respect to the troubled U.S. relationship with China, the substantive goal appears to be similar. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates~’ effort to restore the dialogue between the militaries of the two countries is one indication of that intent. Both goals, however, are encountering headwinds for a key reason. Policy makers seem unwilling to accept the reality that any great power in the international system expects, and will seek to enforce, a sphere of influence in its immediate region. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice famously (or infamously) insisted that the concept of a sphere of influence was both obsolete and pernicious. But that viewpoint is dangerously erroneous. The tensions between the United States and Russia and those between the United States and China confirm that point.

C. Timeframe—Perception trips the link

Accompanying all these diplomatic initiatives has been a vigorous, if largely unheralded, effort 
AND

===OSB===
Abandoning hegemony is the only way to avoid great power conflicts – attempting to prevent the rise of other nations provokes conflict and fails to prevent their rise. Accepting the rise of other powers would force the US into an offshore balancing strategy – that~’s Layne and Schwarz
This solves all of their heg impacts –
A.  Transition conflicts – transition of power towards other powers is already occurring, it~’s a question of how the US deals with it. A collapse of hegemony would force regional powers to take care of conflicts in their region to prevent them from escalating – it~’s in their interest to prevent regional conflicts that would threaten their power. They don~’t do so now because they think the US will clean up the mess for them

B. Great power war – continuing a strategy of primacy makes great power war inevitable – nations such as China will seek to counteract US power and will ally with other nations and transnational groups that fear US power. In a multipolar world, other nations would defend themselves against rising powers, ensuring that they don~’t threaten great powers

C. Regional instability – nations currently have no incentive to prevent regional conflicts because the US has said they~’d do it for them – withdrawal would force them to deal with regional issues before they become a problem

Offshore balancing retains hegemonic flexibility but avoids its negative aspects.
**Walt 5** (Stephen, prof of international relations @ Harvard U, February/March, ~~http://bostonreview.net/BR30.1/walt.php~~ AD: 7/8/10)JM

Constraints are key to creativity~-~--challenging ourselves to innovate within the confines of rules creates far more creative responses than starting with a blank slate

Politicization of life necessarily entails the devaluation and sacrifice of life 
Agamben, 1999 (Gorgio, Homo Sacer, pg. 139-140)
It is as if… every living being. 
The state includes life only to expose it to death. This sovereign untying is the foundation of including bare life in the juridico-political order
Agamben, 1999 (Gorgio, Homo Sacer, pg. 90)
4.3. At a certain point.. originary political element. 
We can only know order in relation to the exception, bluring the distinction between inside and outside endlessly reproducing violence
Caldwell, 2004 (Anne,  Assistant Professor in the Department of Political Science at the University of Louisville, Bio-Sovereignty and The Emergence of Humanity, Theory and Event - Volume 7, Issue 2, project muse)
As he explains, the… sovereign power&amp;#34; (p. 6).
As more and more citizens are incorporated as bare life we all become political lice waiting to be exterminated by the sovereign
Agamben, 1995 (Georgio, Professor of Philosophy, Homo Sacer , p. 113-115)
It is Jean-Luc Nancy&amp;#39;s… virtually homines sacri.
The political arithmetic of states is used to decide whose lives are valuable and whose are not. This logic of calculation robs life of all value and leads to the zero point of the holocaust
Dillon 1999 (Michael, Prof of politics @ the University of Lancaster, Another Justice in Political Theory, Vol. 27, No. 2 april) 
Otherness is born(e).. way of being.
The political order inevitably uses identity to construct and enemy to destroy that makes endless war and extinction inevitable 
Moreiras 2004 (Alberto, Director of European Studies at Duke “A God without Sovereignty. Political Jouissance. The Passive Decision”, CR: The New Centennial Review 4.3, p.81-83, Project MUSE)
Is the unjust… an absolute threat.
Our alternative is to reject the affirmative&amp;#39;s attempt to employ the sovereign discourse of classification and instead embrace whatever being. Simple rejection allows us to access what Agamben calls whatever being. A being that dissolves the state of exception because it does not claim any common identity
Caldwell, 2004 (Anne, prof of poli-sci @ U of Louisville, Theory and Event, vol 7(2))
Can we imagine.. whatever life, appears.

Focus on the transgender body entrenches capitalism on two fronts—

First, it’s openness removes the barriers that prevent endless exploitive power relations.

Drawing on the… of this endeavor?
Second, is a divide-and-conquer strategy used by global capital to prevent labor from overtaking, by empowering local identities. This fractures universal class struggles, which makes oppression inevitable.

MARXISM? GOOD. Capitalism… must be evaluated.&amp;#34;
The alternative is to reject capitalism. Every rejection is key to open a space for new alternatives.

The aff’s claims of social change are caged within the academy and trades-off with their own actions in their daily lives
Gunnell, 1984 (John, What Should Political Theory Be Now?, pg. 351-352)
There may be… simply to ignore them. 
Their advocacy can’t solve this criticism – debate rounds don’t spill over
Atchison and Panetta, Director of Debate at Wake Forest and Director of Debate at the University of Georgia, 9 (Jarrod and Edward, &amp;#34;“Intercollegiate Debate and Speech Communication: Issues for the Future,” The Sage Handbook of Rhetorical Studies, Lunsford, Andrea, ed., 2009, p. 317-334)

The Debate community… and coalition building.  
Personal experience focus shuts down deliberation and makes debate useless
Subotnik 98 Professor of Law, Touro College, Jacob D. Fuchsberg Law Center. 7 Cornell J. L. and Pub. Pol&amp;#39;y 681, Lexis
