Contention 1: The Carrier Gap

First, The Navy just spent billions on new carriers, but the carrier
schedule is stalled

O’Rourke 7/26, Ronald O&amp;#39;Rourke has a M.A. in international studies and
is a naval specialist for the Congressional Research Service, “Navy
Ford (CVN-78) Class Aircraft Carrier Program: Background and Issues
for Congress” http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/weapons/RS20643.pdf

The carrier force will …and the commissioning of CVN-78.

 Second, This schedule creates a severe shortfall- The fleet will be
stuck with an unprecedented low of ten carriers for half a decade

Eaglen, Senior Policy Analyst for National Security at the Heritage
Foundation, 2k8 (Mackenzie, Aug 1st, “Aircraft Carriers Are Crucial”,
The Washington Post)

To maintain 11 carriers,...2013-2014 timeframe.

AND, Maintenance cycles means that less than 10 carriers are deployed.
This kills effectiveness.

Erdossy 7/17-Marty Erdossy is the former Commanding Officer of the USS
George Washington (CVN 73). “Why Does The United States Only Have
Eleven Aircraft Carriers?”

 Typical maintenance periods …of operations and maintenance.

This is especially true with rising tensions with Iran

Foreign Policy 7/20-“This Week at War: If You Build Up, Who Will
Come?” http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/07/20/this_week_at_war_if_you_build_up_who_will_come?page=0,1
Pentagon spokesman George

Little…is certainly headed higher.

AND, Their disads are non-starters. The Navy just increased spending
for carriers

Capaccio 8/5-writer for Bloomberg, “Huntington Risks Losing $194
Million on Navy Carrier Cost”
http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-04-05/huntington-risks-losing-194-million-for-navy-carrier-s-overrun.html

The company would receive the…Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC) in March 2011.

Contention 2 is Sea Power:

Carriers provide unmatched firepower and survivability- that’s key to
military dominance

Allen, Retired Vice Admiral and former Commander of Naval Air Forces of
the Atlantic Fleet, 2k1 (Richard, “Aircraft carriers and sea-based air
power: Smaller is not better and numbers do count!,” Sea Power, June)

Today, the 15 CVBG/14 CVW/600-ship…allies around the world.

And, Naval power is the very foundation of U.S. hegemony. American
dominance invisibly deters myriad challengers and conflicts

Friedman, founder, CEO, and chief intelligence officer of Stratfor,
2k7 (George, April 10th, “The Limitations and Necessity of Naval
Power”, http://www.stratfor.com/limitations_and_necessity_naval_power)

The argument for slashing…foremost, a maritime power.

The impact is Kagan—Enough Said

Kagan, 2007 (Robert, Senior Associate at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace, “End of Dreams, Return of History” Policy Review,
http://www.hoover.org/publications/policyreview/8552512.html#n10)

Finally, there is… will provide an easier path.

Heg Bad isn’t an argument. Obama makes intervention inevitable

Kagan 7 (Robert, senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace and senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund)
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/27/AR2007042702027.html

America must &amp;#34;lead …left-liberal foreign poli

Theoretical arguments about inevitable decline create a
self-fulfilling prophecy- even if collapse is inevitable, we should
attempt to sustain it

Schweller &amp;#39;1 Associate Professor of Political Science at Ohio State
University [Randall L. &amp;#34;The Problem of International Order Revisited&amp;#34;
International Security, 26.1 (Project Muse)]

 First, although hegemonic …with Ikenberry&amp;#39;s prescription.

The alternative is net worse. The transition entails global chaos and
conflict – multipolrity can never exist.

Brzezinski 05 National Security Advisor in the Carter Administration,
Professor of Foreign Policy @ Johns Hopkins University (Zbigniew &amp;#34;The
Choice&amp;#34;)

History is a record of …l stabilizer will also endure. And, Carriers
solve- A robust fleet prevents crisis escalation Eaglen, Senior Policy
Analyst for National Security at the Heritage Foundation, 2k8
(Mackenzie, Aug 1st, “Aircraft Carriers Are Crucial”, The Washington
Post)

For any U.S. president…maintain at least 12 carriers.

The gradual decline of the Navy will leave a vacuum culminating in
major power competition and global war. A strong navy ensures global
stability even through a land defeat.

Robert D. Kaplan November 2007 [Atlantic Monthly, national
correspondent for The Atlantic, is the Class of 1960 Distinguished
Visiting Professor in National Security at the U.S. Naval Academy,
http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200711/america-decline/3]

“Regular wars” between…our elites appear blind.

Contention 3 is Air Power—

The political will and focus of Air Force leaders is killing American
air dominance.

Goure 2010-Daniel, Ph.D., “Say Goodbye To U.S. Air Dominance ~-~- And
Perhaps To Victory In The Next War”
http://www.lexingtoninstitute.org/say-goodbye-to-us-air-dominance~-~-~-~-and-perhaps-to-victory-in-the-next-war?a=1andc=1171

The United States…through the air.

Plan Solves 2 internal links Subpoint A is is Strike Capability:

Carrier air wings maximize air power capability by providing air
missions with deep strike capability and operating capacity.

Lambeth 2k5- Benjamin Lambeth is senior research associate at the RAND
Corporation, “American Carrier Air Power at the Dawn of a New
Century.”

The terrorist attacks…networks, and weapons.

AND, Carriers are the bread and butter of our air power strategy.
Missions are launched and sustained by carrier air wings. Prefer most
recent applications.

Lambeth 2k5- Benjamin Lambeth is senior research associate at the RAND
Corporation, “American Carrier Air Power at the Dawn of a New
Century.” Operation Enduring Freedom…complete the mission.6

Additionally, conventional air power is restricted by bases that our
threatened. Carriers provide unmatched mobility.

Grant 2009 “U.S. Air Dominance Eroding”
http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/2355783/posts

Without functioning ground …likely be exported.

Subpoint B is Jamming Systems: Only carriers have jamming systems that
can engage in electronic warfare but shortages means commanders have
to “gap-fill” land sites. Lambeth 2k5- Benjamin Lambeth is senior
research associate at the RAND Corporation, “American Carrier Air
Power at the Dawn of a New Century.”

After the Air Force…turn-around cycle.”4

Jammers are key to overall effectiveness.

Zaitsev 2k9—April 14, Yury Zaitsev is an academic adviser with the
Russian Academy of Engineering Sciences, “Electronic warfare, a
crucial factor in future conflicts” Electronic warfare will…quite some
time.

Airpower prevents Korean conflict Bechtol 2005 (Bruce is an assistant
professor of national security studies at Air Command and staff
college, “The Future of U.S. airpower on the Korean Peninsula,”
September 1st) http://www.airp ower.maxwell.a f.mil/air
chronicles/apj/apj05/fal05/bechtol.html#bechtol

US military…change in the future.

Now is the key time. The peninsula is on the brink of war

Yonhap 8/6-“N. Korea condemns upcoming S. Korea-U.S. military drills”
North Korea lashed out…to destroy them.

North Korea’s offensive cyber warfare capabilities can cripple the US.
Kim Jong-Il emphasized cyber warfare as the only way to win a war.

Barnes 11-5/17, Ed Barnes is a reporter for FoxNews, “North Korea&amp;#39;s
Cyber Army Gets Increasingly Sophisticated”
http://www.foxnews.com/world/2011/05/17/north-koreas-cyber-army-gets-increasingly-sophisticated/

While the world…an alarming picture.

Offensive cyber attacks ensure miscalc—They can access C3I and launch weapons

Starr 8 (Steven, senior scientist with Physicians for Social
Responsibility, “High-alert nuclear weapons: the forgotten danger,”
SGR Newsletter, Autumn, Issue 36
http://www.wagingpeace.org/articles/2008/10/10_starr_high_alert.pdf)

The possible causes…launch the weapon(s).

This guarantees great power escalation

Fritz, 2009 [Jason, researcher for International Commission on Nuclear
Nonproliferation and Disarmament, former Army officer and consultant,
and has a master of international relations at Bond University,
“Hacking Nuclear Command and Control,” July,

This paper will…control centres directly.

Air power allows the US to win the race for influence and legitimacy in Asia
