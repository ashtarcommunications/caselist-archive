Contention One: Religion of Energy
First, Energy and religion are inseparable. The secular society demands production to achieve the dream of progress while the religious preach austerity to achieve a higher standard of worship. The inevitable shortage of stockpiled energy is fueling both a crisis of civilization and of faith.

Stoekl in 2007
(Allan, professor of French and comparative literature at Penn State University, “Bataille’s Peak: Energy, Religion, and Postsustainability”, p. XI-XII, rcheek)

Now along with a permanent energy crisis, or rather a permanent shortage of cheap 
AND
culture that survived and flourished in the profound absence of fossil fuel.5
And, both the secular and religious fail to understand that God’s sacrifice is our beginning. The energy of God is the energy of everything. The first law of thermodynamics teaches us that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only expended in our participation with the universe.

McMath in 2012
(Judie C., Holistic Health Practitioner with a Master’s Degree in Behavioral Science and a pH.D in Religion, “&amp;#34;God&amp;#34; is the Sum Total of Universal Energy”, http://www.unhinderedliving.com/energyGod.html, rcheek)

Many people debate about whether there is a God, or what God is. 
AND
is part of God and IS God, so there are no mistakes.   
And, ALL IS ENERGY. We live in a sea of energies, even if we are not aware of it. We ourselves are coenergies of energies, and all of these energies are interrelated and connected to the etheric body of the planet and the solar system and thus are expressions of the divine life.

Lucis Trust explains
(“Energy Follows Thought”, http://www.lucistrust.org/en/service_activities/triangles/literature__1/energy_follows_thought, accessed 1/23/13, rcheek)

In the modern world we constantly meet the concept of energy. Yet few ever 
AND
groups, for humanity as a whole, for the planet and beyond. 
Contention Two: Restricted Economy
First, restricting energy to the demands of humanity shatters our intimate connection to the universe. A mechanized process of stockpiling replaces our participation as coenergies of energies and we are left as inert lumps of mass to be expended only when purpose demands it.

Stoekl in 2007
(Allan, professor of French and comparative literature at Penn State University, “Bataille’s Peak: Energy, Religion, and Postsustainability”, p. 55-57, rcheek)

The answer, I think, is to be found in the nature of the 
AND
which the person has been transformed in and through death, have disappeared.
And, restrictions on energy production play to a fantasy of the austere sustainability advocate. The secular ecological saint offers a religion bred by ressentiment to secure a truncated and small existence. 

Stoekl in 2007
(Allan, professor of French and comparative literature at Penn State University, “Bataille’s Peak: Energy, Religion, and Postsustainability”, p. 122-123, rcheek)

At least in the Middle Ages the simple life, the accession to authenticity through 
AND
grand scale that we associate with life in the “developed” countries.

And, these metaphysicians of asceticism express a hatred of this world that denies the value of being

Turlani in 2003
(Aydan, Department of Humanities and Social Sciences Faculty of Letters and Sciences 
Istanbul Technical University, “Nietzsche and the Later Wittgenstein: An Offense to the Quest for Another World”, The Journal of Nietzsche Studies, 26 (2003), 55-63)

The craving for absolutely general specifications results in doing metaphysics. Unlike Wittgenstein, Nietzsche 
AND
the way out of the fly-bottle&amp;#34; (PI §309). 
Therefore, we affirm that energy should be free.
It is up to us to imagine a new relationship to energy. We must free energy from its servility to work by practicing religion as a scattering of doctrine. God’s gift is in the dispersal of energy, its production as generosity and risk.

Stoekl in 2007
(Allan, professor of French and comparative literature at Penn State University, “Bataille’s Peak: Energy, Religion, and Postsustainability”, p. 59, rcheek)

We have no model of such a city. It is up to us to 
AND
as the non -place, the u -topos, of scattering.
Contention Three: Sovereignty
And, the generosity of the sun teaches us that there is no such thing as “Good” or “Evil”, rather, that existence just IS. Events are not good or bad, they merely occur and death is not the end of life, it is a new beginning. We must learn to walk in both the light AND the dark, only then will we find value in both. 

Nelson in 2009
(Judie C., Master&amp;#39;s Degree in Behavioral Science, “Lessons from the Sun”, http://www.unhinderedliving.com/sunlessons.html, rcheek)

When doing some research on ancient civilizations and their religious beliefs, I was not 
AND
. Learn to see in them both.  Find the value in each. 
And, only our impact matters because we are already dead. What we call “our life” is an experience that takes place in time and space, a physical experience that has already passed. The future likewise doesn’t exist because the future is not here. Our experience is always now. True life is revealed in the present moment. 

Bahder in 2007
(Paul, Medical Doctor, “We Are Already Dead”, http://www.homeopathyusa.com/we_are_already_dead.htm, rcheek)

What we call “our life” is really the experience that takes place in 
AND
time. Time has no entrance into eternal even though eternal permeates time.

And, utilitarian calculation denies true life because it enslaves us to the demands of the future. Instrumental reason subjugates existence to the realm of work. Gripped by the fear of death and the yearning to endure, we are rendered servile to transcendent purpose. This profane existence is not worth saving. It deprives us from sovereignty and the freedom of now.

The gift of the sun is one without return. It gives without receiving and as such, the surface of the globe is abound with an abundance of solar energy.  This energy is always already in a state of constant production and expenditure by all forms of life.  

Stoekl in 2007
(Allan, professor of French and comparative literature at Penn State University, “Bataille’s Peak: Energy, Religion, and Postsustainability”, p. 39-40, rcheek)

Indeed, these assumptions are among those most contested by current energy theorists and experts
AND
have to be burned off. There will always be too much life. 

Expenditure is the universal tendency of existence toward the excessive production of energy.  Our question now becomes, in what fashion does this expenditure take place?  Energy must be held sacred, expended in the instant that leads nowhere.  It is in the instant of uselessness that sovereignty is attained.
Eggington in 2008
(William, Chair and Andrew W Mellon Professor in the Humanities German and Romance Languages and Literatures The Johns Hopkins University, “Batailleâ€™s Peak: Energy, Religion, and Postsustainability (review)”, symploke, Volume 16, Numbers 1-2, 2008, pp. 346-348, pMUSE, rcheek)

In this book, Alan Stoekl argues that Georges Bataille’s theories of energy and religion 
AND
anyone or anything else: sovereign, in Bataille’s sense. (xiii)

However, status quo energy production is profane.  Rather than be made an intimate religious experience, energy and its expenditure have been put to work through a mechanized process of utility that renders intimacy impossible.  The raw passion of life is turned into a standing reserve, a thing among other things, which enables its destruction.

Stoekl in 2007
(Allan, professor of French and comparative literature at Penn State University, “Bataille’s Peak: Energy, Religion, and Postsustainability”, p. 55-57, rcheek)

The answer, I think, is to be found in the nature of the 
AND
which the person has been transformed in and through death, have disappeared.

The useless and radically anti-utilitarian ethic of the 1AC restore expenditure to the realm of the sacred.  This operates in opposition to a restricted economy based on the tenets of utility and calculations that deprive humanity of its sovereignty.  Such an economy reduces energy to a thing so as to exercise dominion.  This denial of the animality of existence separates humanity from itself and makes life a profane denial  of itself.

Biles in 2011
(Jeremy, PhD from the University of Chicago Divinity School, “The Remains of God: Bataille/Sacrifice/Community”, Culture, Theory and Critique, 2011, 52(2–3), 127–144, rcheek)

All such expenditures – useless, diverted from any utilitarian ends –¶ obviously ‘go 
AND
when it lives in immanence’, or continuity (Hollier 1998: 65).

This mortal anxiety establishes an ascetic hatred of the world that denies life.  The only escape is through a chaotic embrace of life.

Turlani in 2003
(Aydan, Department of Humanities and Social Sciences Faculty of Letters and Sciences 
Istanbul Technical University, “Nietzsche and the Later Wittgenstein: An Offense to the Quest for Another World”, The Journal of Nietzsche Studies, 26 (2003), 55-63)

The craving for absolutely general specifications results in doing metaphysics. Unlike Wittgenstein, Nietzsche 
AND
the way out of the fly-bottle&amp;#34; (PI §309). 

And, hyper-consumerism is not our potlatch – It entails a stock-piled self that is still reliant upon a static conception of energy as product and not religion.  The affirmation of intimate expenditure counters this stockpiled self and puts at risk the stability energy and subjectivity.  The irony of this reckless abandon is that it creates a post-sustainable aftereffect more capable of sustaining life than a restricted economy.

Stoekl in 2007
(Allan, professor of French and comparative literature at Penn State University, “Bataille’s Peak: Energy, Religion, and Postsustainability”, p. 57-59, rcheek)

Bataille, then, should have distinguished more clearly between intimate and impersonal varieties of 
AND
but the movement of bodies in transport, in ecstasy, in despair?
Therefore, the ballot represents a choice between two economies of energy production:  The status quo represents a restricted economy of productivity of which the quintessential nature is endless violence while an affirmative ballot endorses a general economy of sacred expenditure.   

Biles in 2011
(Jeremy, PhD from the University of Chicago Divinity School, “The Remains of God: Bataille/Sacrifice/Community”, Culture, Theory and Critique, 2011, 52(2–3), 127–144, rcheek)

The core of this betrayal lay in communism’s negation of human ‘sovereignty’,¶ a 
AND
tears, artistic and poetic¶ exudations, and various forms of intoxication.

Contention Two is Sacrificing God
Politics operates from a standpoint of reason, fear of death, and securing a future.  This profane world of utility upholds such values as a transcendent God that denies the possibility of intimate expenditure.  We must sacrifice the God of reason to restore sovereignty. In being destroyed, we render it useless, which frees us from servility to instrumental utility.

Biles in 2011
(Jeremy, PhD from the University of Chicago Divinity School, “The Remains of God: Bataille/Sacrifice/Community”, Culture, Theory and Critique, 2011, 52(2–3), 127–144, rcheek)

The anxious desire for durability corresponds to a demeaning substantialisation¶ of the sacred. 
AND
undergoes a fleeting experience of dissolution¶ in the realm of the sacred.

This sacrifice is a utility of non-utility – far from a quest for masterful control of the resolution, our ecstatic abandonment of it ruptures restricted economies that lash out in exclusionary and violent ways to establish a true moment of communal unity
Biles in 2011
(Jeremy, PhD from the University of Chicago Divinity School, “The Remains of God: Bataille/Sacrifice/Community”, Culture, Theory and Critique, 2011, 52(2–3), 127–144, rcheek)

In this sense, then, a sacrifice is always a sacrifice of God, 
AND
¶ the closed, individual self as formed through social prohibitions and work.

We sacrifice the God of reason that enslaves us as instruments of work. Only voting affirmative frees you from the domain of utility that the resolution has elevated to a metaphysical beyond.  Use reason against itself and vote affirmative as a counter-operation to the status quo.

Biles in 2011
(Jeremy, PhD from the University of Chicago Divinity School, “The Remains of God: Bataille/Sacrifice/Community”, Culture, Theory and Critique, 2011, 52(2–3), 127–144, rcheek)

This communication, this ecstatic and often tormenting loss of self in continuity¶ with 
AND
the refusal to put off existence in some beyond (1988: 47).
Thus we ask you to vote affirmative to sacrifice the resolution.

Contention Three Is Curriculum
Refuse debate’s traditional curriculum. It’s hatred of chance enslaves us to utility. The sacrificial curriculum of the affirmative is a an embrace of the rupture of unreasoned life that opens spaces for desire.

What Lingis feels in his journeys in Honduras is a sense of two worlds, 
AND
going out; they have¶ a certain amount of control over that.

The resolution embraces a God of Reason that must be sacrificed. We are a new pedagogy of heterogeneity that transgresses possibility and radically opposes debates educational stagnation 

Sirc in 1996

What Bataille wants-the laceration, the communication of loss, the¶ ecstasy
AND
sacred and its replacement by an other worldly deity&amp;#34; (Comay 69).

The resolution forces us to profane ourselves, our bodies, and our world – by installing a composition that centers on the contemporary project of technological advancement, we enable the destruction of sovereignty and life.

In order to reach Schell’s “end state” we must do more than dismantle our nuclear arsenal, we have to make it disappear.  The primary consideration is not the number of remaining weapons but our capacity to rebuild them.

LFTRs consume the nuclear materials of decommissioned weapons and turns it into fuel for the reactor.  The end product of which can never be weaponized

Sorensen, 2010 Kirk, Fmr NASA engineer and Founder of Flibe Energy, TEAC2 Conference Keynote, http://energyfromthorium.com/2010/03/29/, V. Guevara

Then there’s thorium. Thorium has a special property—it breeds to uranium-
AND
fuel is magnified by about 1000 to 1500% over a fast reactor. 

If we don’t deplete the weapons stockpile by consuming the fissile material for power, then the state will continue to hold nuclear weapons as an inexorable legacy worthy of noncontingent preservation

Guevara

There is much at stake, then, in how nuclear stewardship rhetoric is produced
AND
these¶ claims through a critique of three themes in SSP rhetoric.8

The elimination of nuclear weapons provides a site of resistance to the military industrial complex’s use of nuclear material.  This debate demands that the state reconceive nuclear use as a civilian program instead of normalizing nuclear as a strictly weaponized product that is owned and maintained only by the state.

¶ What then, we may ask, does this debate portend for the future 
AND
anticipate¶ or reflect upon the appropriations and consequences of their creations.86

The affirmative ballot is a call to challenge state-activism.  Lifting federal restrictions on access to thorium allows private individuals to develop LFTRs, which are designed to consume the nuclear state.  It is only by restricting government activity, that we can achieve a free life. Affirming individual liberty versus a status quo of statist control is the only way to avoid extinction.

and in behalf of avoiding¶ massive ruin and the possibility of extinction.

Advantage 2: Pu-238

Pu-238 is critical for deep space missions and NASA is running out. Without more, the space program will collapse and the U.S. will cease to be the leader in space.  Up to now, the only way Pu-238 could be created was as a byproduct of nuclear warhead production

The time is now.  The American economy, its culture of innovation and the world’s ability to fulfill its energy demands hinges on the creation of a federally sanctioned thorium bank

With this approach, plutonium from weapons and reactor fuel will start about 70 chloride

can make it happen. May we have the wisdom to do so.
LFTRs are safer, produce far less waste, solve proliferation concerns and cost less to provide more energy to the grid.

==Contention One: Secular Energy Policy==

====First, the end of the fossil fuel interlude is upon us. God has called on us to shape our destiny. We need an energy policy based in hope to transition from the death of this era to a renewal of life in the next. ====

**Rasmussen in 2011**
(Larry L., Reinhold Niebuhr Professor Emeritus of Social Ethics, Union Theological Seminary in New York City, &amp;#34;ENERGY: THE CHALLENGES TO AND FROM RELIGION&amp;#34;, Zygon, vol. 46, no. 4, rcheek)

As nature abhors a vacuum, so human history resists a dead end. Many
AND
is¶ the world we have, graphed by scientists tracking global trends.

====And, the transition requires a new ecological phase of religion. We must be converted to Earth and God in the same moment so that all impulses are measured by their contribution to the well-being of creation. ====

**Rasmussen in 2011**
(Larry L., Reinhold Niebuhr Professor Emeritus of Social Ethics, Union Theological Seminary in New York City, &amp;#34;ENERGY: THE CHALLENGES TO AND FROM RELIGION&amp;#34;, Zygon, vol. 46, no. 4, rcheek)

What is the challenge to religion? The same as for all things human.¶ 
AND
the heart, in theology¶ and ethics together with rituals and practice.

====And, status quo energy production transforms the ethic of dominion into one of domination over the environment. This perversion is a sin of idolatry that sacrifices the wholeness of creation.====

**Birch in 1978**
(Dr. Bruce, professor of Old Testament, &amp;#34;Energy Ethics Reaches the Church~’s Agenda&amp;#34; Christian Century, November 1, http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=1782-http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=1782, Dil)
In the biblical theme of creation we are reminded of the interconnectedness of humanity with 
AND
ones that the church must wield what actual and moral power it possesses.

====And, fossil fuels are the backbone of a secular religion that separates God from the polis by deifying unlimited economic growth. Any benefit to this energy intense consumerism is tethered to a pathological indifference toward life. ====

**Rasmussen in 2011**
(Larry L., Reinhold Niebuhr Professor Emeritus of Social Ethics, Union Theological Seminary in New York City, &amp;#34;ENERGY: THE CHALLENGES TO AND FROM RELIGION&amp;#34;, Zygon, vol. 46, no. 4, rcheek)

The same curves on all the graphs have been possible because of fossil¶ fuel 
AND
19). Neighborkeeping at the expense of Earthkeeping is a sure dead end.

====And, secular energy policy exacerbates poverty and endangers creation by dislocating theology from human participation in the environment. Our objective should be to instill the virtues of a world we wish to inhabit based on stewardship, justice and hope====

**Birch in 1978**
(Dr. Bruce,  professor of Old Testament, &amp;#34;Energy Ethics Reaches the Church~’s Agenda&amp;#34; Christian Century, November 1, http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=1782-http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=1782, Dil)

The proposed policy statement will certainly be a controversial document, but it is also 
AND
the biblical witness to creation, redemption, stewardship, justice and hope.&amp;#34;


====And separating God from the polis is a form of self-mutilation that replaces God with self-legislation. This results in a violent denial that takes being-towards-death as our only future====

**Blond in 1998**
(Phillip, Senior Lecturer in Christian theology at the University of Cumbria, Post-Secular Philosophy: Between Philosophy and Theology, p. 1-3)

We live in a time of failed conditions. Everywhere people who have no faith 
AND
until their deaths, unaware of that which they never sought to address.

==Contention Two: Eucharistic Hope==

====In response to the idolatry of status quo energy production, we affirm the resolution as a starting point to imagine the Eucharistic community we hope for:====

====The United States federal government should substantially reduce restrictions on and/or substantially increase financial incentives for a dispersed grid of wind and/or solar energy production.====

====In the Eucharist, we consume without impoverishing others. Our consumption strengthens the community and establishes a connection with God. A dispersed grid of energy production comes from and strengthens the community as a vital resource distributed and accessible to all, bringing us closer to the vision of a fulfilled world.====

**Hartman in 2011**
(Laura M., Assistant Professor of Religion at Augustana College,  January 26, &amp;#34;The Christian Consumer&amp;#34;, Pages 165-166, Dil)

In the Eucharist, the people of God consume in a way that enriches them 
AND
as much as, or more than, they take away from it.


====Hope is a precondition to energy policy. A theology of energy policy requires flexibility. Voting aff is an act of hope that moves us beyond status quo fear and guilt over energy policy towards the eschatological fulfillment of life====

**Laurendeau in 2011**
(Normand M., Bailey Professor Emeritus of Combustion, School of
Mechanical Engineering, Purdue University, &amp;#34;AN ENERGY PRIMER: FROM THERMODYNAMICS TO THEOLOGY&amp;#34;, Zygon: Journal Of Religion %26 Science, 46(4), 890-914, rcheek)

Why should religion be involved in energy policy? Three reasons come¶ to mind
AND
, lest we drop the ball and fail our children and¶ grandchildren.


====And, hope stands outside of and in opposition to the apocalyptic prognostication of status quo politics.  It reclaims the future as something beyond control or prediction and filled with possibility.====

Mathewes in 2007 
(Charles ~~Prof Religious Studies @ Univ of Virginia~~ A Theology of Public Life, pp.219-220)

A critic might say; but how, precisely, do they manifest the virtue 
AND
message, but also its deepest ascesis. We turn to that next.


====And, hope is an embrace of the vulnerability that gives human life significance====

Mathewes in 2007 
(Charles ~~Prof Religious Studies @ Univ of Virginia~~ A Theology of Public Life, pp.219-220)

Hope~’s patience, its openness to the new, enables realistic vision. This may 
AND
and how engagement in public life enriches our inhabitation of hope as well.

====And, hope is politically mobilizing in both its resistance and its recognitions. We refuse to live in the lie that condemns us to a living death and instead imagine a counter-polis that we can work to transform reality closer to.====

Mathewes in 2007 
(Charles ~~Prof Religious Studies @ Univ of Virginia~~ A Theology of Public Life, pp.219-220)

Hope~’s civic contributions begin with its power to mobilize people~’s energy for civic change, 
AND
way and adds to the memory of Being. (1997: 239)
