Rather than be made an intimate religious experience, energy and its expenditure have been put to work through a mechanized process of utility that renders intimacy impossible.  The raw passion of life is turned into a standing reserve, a thing among other things, which enables its destruction.

Stoekl in 2007
(Allan, professor of French and comparative literature at Penn State University, “Bataille’s Peak: Energy, Religion, and Postsustainability”, p. 55-57, rcheek)

The answer, I think, is to be found in the nature of the 
AND
which the person has been transformed in and through death, have disappeared.

We must restore expenditure to the realm of the sacred.  This operates in opposition to a restricted economy based on the tenets of utility and calculations that deprive humanity of its sovereignty.  Such an economy reduces energy to a thing so as to exercise dominion.  This denial of the animality of existence separates humanity from itself and makes life a profane denial  of itself.

Biles in 2011
(Jeremy, PhD from the University of Chicago Divinity School, “The Remains of God: Bataille/Sacrifice/Community”, Culture, Theory and Critique, 2011, 52(2–3), 127–144, rcheek)

All such expenditures – useless, diverted from any utilitarian ends –¶ obviously ‘go

This mortal anxiety establishes an ascetic hatred of the world that denies life.  The only escape is through a chaotic embrace of life.

The alternative is to sacrifice the 1AC.
Politics operates from a standpoint of reason.  This profane world of utility denies the possibility of intimate expenditure.  We must sacrifice the God of reason to restore sovereignty. In being destroyed, we render the 1AC useless, which frees us from servility to instrumental utility.
