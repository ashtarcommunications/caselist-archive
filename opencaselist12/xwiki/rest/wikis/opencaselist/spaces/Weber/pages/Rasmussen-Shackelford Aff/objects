However, readers must not forget that few policies and laws bring the types ¶ &#xD;
AND&#xD;
cycles, the engagement of ordinary people and a lucrative green ¶ economy. &#xD;
&#xD;
And, FiTs should start as a simple mechanism to invite all parts of society to become electricity producers&#xD;

&#xD;
In countries with a relatively short history of renewable energy development, ¶ and those &#xD;
AND&#xD;
begin with the most basic element of any FIT programme, eligible technologies. &#xD;
&#xD;
Finally, federal action is key. Lack of a national FiT has led to a state system that is insolvent.&#xD;

&#xD;
Given the obvious success of FiTs as a policy tool in Europe, one must &#xD;
AND&#xD;
already-marginal profit to the financial industry instead of adding new capacity.&#xD;

Advantage Two: Economy&#xD;
First, Feed-in Tariffs are the most effective policy for renewable energy growth, but have not been instituted nationally in the U.S.&#xD;

Instead of FITs, 31 of the 50 U.S. states have passed &#xD;
AND&#xD;
been avid opposition from electric utility companies in many states to enacting FITs.¶ &#xD;

FiTs are key to economic growth. Three internals: increases investor confidence, boosts manufacturing industry, and creates jobs.&#xD;
