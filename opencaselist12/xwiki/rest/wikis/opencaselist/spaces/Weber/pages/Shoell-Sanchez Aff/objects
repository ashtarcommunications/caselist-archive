In the U.S., all nuclear power plants were initially licensed to operate

Plan
Edit
Plan:  the United States Federal Government should remove all restrictions to the formation of a thorium bank in the United States. Normal means. Funding and enforcement guaranteed.

Advantage 1:  Kicking Nixon
Edit
The only reason that LFTRs were not adopted earlier is because Nixon wanted nuclear energy that could be weaponized. Today, the DOE and NRC maintain the same regulatory policy of obstructionism.

Advantage 1: Nuclear Stewardship
In April 2009, Obama forged his vision to move forward to a nuclear free world in Prague 
Obama, 2009 [&amp;#34;Obama Prague Speech On Nuclear Weapons: Full Text&amp;#34;  Huffington Post, http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/04/05/obama-prague-speech-on-nu_n_183219.html, V. Guevara]

The existence of thousands of nuclear weapons is the most dangerous legacy of the Cold 
AND
to combat climate change, and to advance peace opportunity for all people.


The START II negotiations yielded a significant arms reduction agreement.  The U.S. and the Russians are already disarming to historic levels

Kissinger and Scowcroft, 2012 [Henry Kissinger, Frmr. Secretary of State and National Security Advisor and Brent Scowcroft, Frmr National Security Advisor,  Washington Post, &amp;#34; Nuclear weapons reductions must be part of strategic analysis&amp;#34;  http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/nuclear-weapon-reductions-must-be-part-of-strategic-analysis/2012/04/22/gIQAKG4iaT_story.html, V. Guevara]

A New START treaty reestablishing the process of nuclear arms control has recently taken effect
AND
round of nuclear reductions to bring about ceilings as low as 300 warheads. 

The impact to disarmament is linear - each decommissioned warhead reduces the risk of the ultimate tragedy

Freeman, 2009 [Lawrence, Prof of war studies at King&amp;#39;s College in London and vice principal of the college, &amp;#34;A new theory for nuclear disarmament&amp;#34; Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, V. Guevara]
The numbers ¶ games became complicated by questions of first and second strikes, ¶ 
AND
or mitigation of the ultimate tragedy ¶ should nuclear exchanges begin in earnest.


In order to reach Schell’s “end state” we must do more than dismantle our nuclear arsenal, we have to make it disappear.  The primary consideration is not the number of remaining weapons but our capacity to rebuild them.

Drell and Goodby, 2009  [Sidney D. Drell, physicist and arms control expert. He is a professor emeritus at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center and a senior fellow at Stanford University&amp;#39;s Hoover Institution, James E. Goodby, Frmr specialist with the US Atomic Energy Commission, vice chairman of START I and non proliferation expert, Fellow at Hoover and Brookings, &amp;#34;A World without Nuclear Weapons: End Stat Issues&amp;#34;  Hoover Institution, http://media.hoover.org/sites/default/files/documents/Sidney_Drell_James_Goodby_A_World_Without_Nuclear_Weapons_1.pdf, V. Guevara]

In his 1984 book, The Abolition, Schell describes a condition that we think 
AND
that “a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.”

LFTRs consume the nuclear materials of decommissioned weapons and turns it into fuel for the reactor.  The end product of which can never be weaponized

Sorensen, 2010 [Kirk, Fmr NASA engineer and Founder of Flibe Energy, TEAC2 Conference Keynote, http://energyfromthorium.com/2010/03/29/, V. Guevara]

Then there’s thorium. Thorium has a special property—it breeds to uranium-
AND
fuel is magnified by about 1000 to 1500% over a fast reactor. 

If we don’t deplete the weapons stockpile by consuming the fissile material for power, then the state will continue to hold nuclear weapons as an inexorable legacy worthy of noncontingent preservation

Taylor and Hendry, 2008 [Bryan C.,  Associate Prof of Communication @ UC Boulder and  Judith, Lecturer Dept of Communication and Journalism at University of New Mexico Albuquerque,  Summer &amp;#34;Insisting on Persisting:  The Nuclear Rhetoric of &amp;#39;Stockpile Stewardship&amp;#39;&amp;#34; Rhetoric and Public Affairs, 11.2, V. Guevara]

There is much at stake, then, in how nuclear stewardship rhetoric is produced
AND
these¶ claims through a critique of three themes in SSP rhetoric.8

The elimination of nuclear weapons provides a site of resistance to the military industrial complex’s use of nuclear material.  This debate demands that the state reconceive nuclear use as a civilian program instead of normalizing nuclear as a strictly weaponized product that is owned and maintained only by the state.  

Taylor and Hendry, 2008 [Bryan C.,  Associate Prof of Communication @ UC Boulder and  Judith, Lecturer Dept of Communication and Journalism at University of New Mexico Albuquerque,  Summer &amp;#34;Insisting on Persisting:  The Nuclear Rhetoric of &amp;#39;Stockpile Stewardship&amp;#39;&amp;#34; Rhetoric and Public Affairs, 11.2, V. Guevara]

¶ What then, we may ask, does this debate portend for the future 
AND
anticipate¶ or reflect upon the appropriations and consequences of their creations.86

The affirmative ballot is a call to challenge state-activism.  Lifting federal restrictions on access to thorium allows private individuals to develop LFTRs, which are designed to consume the nuclear state.  It is only by restricting government activity, that we can achieve a free life. Affirming individual liberty versus a status quo of statist control is the only way to avoid extinction.

Kateb, 1986 [George, Professor Emeritus of Politics at Princeton University, &amp;#34;Nuclear Weapons and Individual Rights&amp;#34;  Dissent Magazine, V. Guevara]

One task of a renewed and revised individualism is to challenge everyday state-activism
AND
and in behalf of avoiding¶ massive ruin and the possibility of extinction.


Advantage 2: Pu-238

 Pu-238 is critical for deep space missions and NASA is running out. Without more, the space program will collapse and the U.S. will cease to be the leader in space.  Up to now, the only way Pu-238 could be created was as a byproduct of nuclear warhead production

Chow, 2011 [Denise, staff writer @ Space.com, November 22nd “Mars Mission May Be Curtain Call For Plutonium-Powered Spacecraft”  http://www.space.com/13709-plutonium-shortage-nasa-planetary-science-future.html, V. Guevara]

For 50 years, NASA has used plutonium-238 as the fuel source for 
AND
be that close to the edge before we’re out of capability is irresponsible.&amp;#34;


Each ton of thorium used in a LFTR produces over $1 billion in useful byproduct materials, including Plutonium 238 for NASA missions.  A LFTR fleet could solve NASA’s shortage without building new warheads

Sorenson, 2010 [Kirk, retired NASA engineer and founder of Flibe Energy, December 6th “Is Nuclear Waste Really Nuclear Waste” Google Talk, http://thoriummsr.com/tag/chloride-reactor/, V. Guevara]

Each metric tonne of thorium consumed in a LFTR could produce:¶ 9900 GWe*
AND
and neodymium¶ and many lives saved through clean electricity and medical radioisotopes.


And, US space leadership key to overall us hegemony and military readiness, the global economy, our ability to respond to natural disasters, solving environmental destruction and maintaining strong global non-proliferation efforts
DoD 11 (“National Security Space Strategy” unclassified summary, 2011, http://www.defense.gov/home/features/2011/0111_nsss/docs/NationalSecuritySpaceStrategyUnclassifiedSummary_Jan2011.pdf)  rory

In the U.S., all nuclear power plants were initially licensed to operate 
AND
reactors have been relicensed. No applications for license renewal have been rejected.
The issue is not with nuclear power but with the reactor design. LFTRs, can’t meltdown and can’t be weaponized.

Fukushima must mark a turning point in the history of nuclear power. The proponents 
AND
life. This is the real risk we need to be vigilant against.



LFTR solves warming, poverty, millions of air pollution deaths and the economy

Hargraves, 2012 Robert, teaches energy policy at Dartmouth ILEAD, PhD Physics Brown University, July 25th “Thorium: energy cheaper than coal”  V. Guevara

New energy technology solves more problems than just global¶ warming. Some people are 
AND
to a sustainable population.¶ • Reducing CO2 emissions will check global warming.


Advantage 2:  The Race for IPR


The race is on for LFTR technology. US leadership depends on its development.
Watts, 2011 Anthony, meteorologist, “China announces thorium reactor energy program, Obama still dwelling on ‘Sputnik moments’” http://wattsupwiththat.com/2011/01/30/china-announces-thorium-reactor-energy-program-obama-still-dwelling-on-sputnik-moments/, V. Guevara

China announces thorium reactor energy program, Obama still dwelling on “Sputnik moments” 
AND
them to finally do something about our energy future besides tilt at windmills.

China is determined to develop a stranglehold on intellectual property rights on LFTR technology.

Martin, 2012 Richard, editorial director for Pike Research, the leading clean energy research and analysis firm, Super Fuel: Thorium, the Green Energy Source for the Future, p. 140-1, V. Guevara

China has 14 nuclear power reactors in operation on the mainland¶ today, with 
AND
lifeline of energy in¶ its own hands,” Wen Hui Baa reported.”

China will have a fully operational LFTR program by 2020.

Rhodes, 2012 Chris, youngest professor of physical chemistry in the UK @ Liverpool John Moores University and energy consultant, “Hopes Build for Thorium Nuclear Energy” http://oilprice.com/Alternative-Energy/Nuclear-Power/Hopes-Build-for-Thorium-Nuclear-Energy.html, V. Guevara

As noted below, an alternative means to use thorium as a fuel is in 
AND
LFR-based thorium-power programme, to be active by 2020.

If unchecked, China will become the Saudi Arabia of the nuclear power world,. Passing on LFTRs now will ensure the collapse of the American empire by 2030 
Martin, 2012 Richard, editorial director for Pike Research, the leading clean energy research and analysis firm, Super Fuel: Thorium, the Green Energy Source for the Future, p. 213-4, V. Guevara

They are right about one thing: the United States is not likely to be 
AND
¶ will support a new form of nuclear power so soon after Fukushima?

Collapse of US Leadership causes a global power vacuum resulting in nuclear war.
Ferguson 04  (professor of history at New York University&amp;#39;s Stern School of Business and senior fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University (Niall, “A World without Power”, Foreign Policy )

Could an apolar world today produce an era reminiscent of the age of Alfred? 
AND
great powers would benefit from such a not-so-new world disorder

Advantage 3: Pu-238
Pu-238 is critical for deep space missions and NASA is running out. Without more, the space program will collapse and the U.S. will cease to be the leader in space.  Up to now, the only way Pu-238 could be created was as a byproduct of nuclear warhead production

Chow, 2011 Denise, staff writer @ Space.com, November 22nd “Mars Mission May Be Curtain Call For Plutonium-Powered Spacecraft”  http://www.space.com/13709-plutonium-shortage-nasa-planetary-science-future.html, V. Guevara

For 50 years, NASA has used plutonium-238 as the fuel source for 
AND
be that close to the edge before we’re out of capability is irresponsible.&amp;#34;


Each ton of thorium used in a LFTR produces over $1 billion in useful byproduct materials, including Plutonium 238 for NASA missions.  A LFTR fleet could solve NASA’s shortage without building new warheads

Sorenson, 2010 Kirk, retired NASA engineer and founder of Flibe Energy, December 6th “Is Nuclear Waste Really Nuclear Waste” Google Talk, http://thoriummsr.com/tag/chloride-reactor/, V. Guevara

Each metric tonne of thorium consumed in a LFTR could produce:¶ 9900 GWe*
AND
and neodymium¶ and many lives saved through clean electricity and medical radioisotopes.


And, every year that the U.S. goes without producing Pu-238 is time lost on humanity’s clock to explore deep space

Aerospace Industries Association, 2012 &amp;#34;Continued U.S. Leadership in Deep Space Exploration Depends on Restarting Plutonium Fuel Production&amp;#34;  http://www.aia-aerospace.org/assets/2012%20AIA%20Pu-238%20White%20Paper%20-%20SC%20FINAL.pdf, V. Guevara

Solvency

All the private sector needs is for Congress to authorize a thorium bank to allow for the development of thorium for energy

¶ Two problems: Most countries in the West lack policy that supports thorium nuclear
AND
give us a pathway so that people can invest intelligently¶ and safely.”

The time is now.  The American economy and the world’s ability fulfill its energy demands hinges on the creation of a federally sanctioned thorium bank
Martin, 2012 Richard, editorial director for Pike Research, the leading clean energy research and analysis firm, Super Fuel: Thorium, the Green Energy Source for the Future, p. 189, V. Guevara

A centralized rare earths facility would enable producers to invest¶ together in federally sanctioned

,” Kennedy told me. “If we miss it, we’re toast.”

The U.S. could have 1000 LFTRs online in less than 20 years. 

Sorensen, 2010 Kirk, Fmr NASA engineer and Founder of Flibe Energy, TEAC2 Conference Keynote, http://energyfromthorium.com/2010/03/29/, V. Guevara

With this approach, plutonium from weapons and reactor fuel will start about 70 chloride 
AND
can make it happen. May we have the wisdom to do so.

LFTRs are safer, produce far less waste, solve proliferation concerns and 
cost less to provide more energy to the grid.

Lastly, thorium power could reverse a few millennia of the creeping risk of mass extinction in less than a century
