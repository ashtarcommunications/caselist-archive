(Theodore, former assistant professor at the University of California, Berkeley, PhD in mathematics from the University of Michigan, Industrial Society and its Future, http://www.42inc.com/~estephen/manifesto/unabe2.html)
24. Psychologists use the term &amp;#34;socialization&amp;#34; to designate the process by which 
AND
how to make love, how to raise our kids and so forth. 

And, guilt expresses a hatred of this world that allows for a secret instinct of annihilation
Nietzsche,  1872 (Friedrich, philosopher, “The Birth of Tragedy” Online, MB)
Already in the preface addressed to Richard Wagner, art, and not morality, 
AND
in the name of a Greek god: I called it Dionysian. — 
And, the industrial-technological system will guarantee the enslavement and eventual extinction of all living organisms.

Kaczynski in 1995
(Theodore, former assistant professor at the University of California, Berkeley, PhD in mathematics from the University of Michigan, Industrial Society and its Future, http://www.42inc.com/~estephen/manifesto/unabe2.html)

171. But suppose now that industrial society does survive the next several decade and

would be better to dump the whole stinking system and take the consequences. 


The alternative is to destroy the industrial-technological system.

Only a revolutionary strategy against modern technology can break down the system. Any perm would compromise the revolution by enabling technological solutions to other problems.

1)	Interpretation: The affirmative must defend the implementation of a topical plan by the United States federal government as better than the status quo or a competitive alternative.

2)	Definitional Support
a)	USFG is the government located in Washington, D.C.
WEST&amp;#39;S LEGAL THESAURUS/DICTIONARY 85, p. 744.
United States: Usually means the federal government centered in Washington, D.C.

b)	Should expresses desirability

c)	Increase means to make greater
Merriam-Webster Dictionary 11
(http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/increase)
		1 : to make greater ; augment

3)	Violation: the aff team does not defend a topical plan

a.	Switch-side debate – plan focus is key to switch-side debate because it forces the aff to defend a plan half the time – this is good

First, its key to education
Muir ‘93 (Star, Prof. Comm. – George Mason U., Philosophy and Rhetoric, “A Defense of the Ethics of Contemporary Debate”, 26(4))

The melding of different areas of knowledge, however, is a particular benefit of 
AND
of knowledge, and is a major rationale for switch-side debate. 

		 
b.	There is a topical version of the aff, which solves their impact turns – They can send drag queens into space. 

c.	The competitive nature of debate undermines their advocacy
Mitchell 98
Gordon R. Mitchell, Assistant Professor of Communication, University of Pittsburgh, ARGUMENTATION AND ADVOCACY, Fall 1998

Within the limited horizon of zero-sum competition in the contest round framework for 
AND
competitive payoffs at the expense of opportunities for co-operative &amp;#34;rethinking.&amp;#34;

D. Fairness – They unlimit the topic – this is bad 

First, they will destroy the debate community.
Heidt in 2003
(Jenny, Director of Forensics at the Westminster Schools, “Performance Debates: How to Defend     Yourself”, Rostrum, April, 2003, http://debate.uvm.edu/NFL/rostrumlib/ cxHeidtcx0403.pdf, rcheek)

When faced with these challenges to the fairness of the performance, the affirmative is 
AND
separate the value of the affirmative harm claim from procedural issues of fairness.


Second, unfairness undermines their advocacy – if the negative cannot test the assumptions and claims of the affirmative, activism can’t improve

Third, this instance of unfairness is unique – nowhere in the real world would we be forced to advocate indefensible positions like “racism is good” which means their K teaches us nothing about life outside debate

Fourth, debaters are more willing to consider positions that they have lost to if they are beat fairly– unfairness shuts out hearts and minds

4)	Framework is a reason to vote negative to preserve competitive equity

Disavowal of the violence of representation and calls for internal rethinking rely on assumptions of metaphysical innocence – fetishizing an authenticity that never existed

Education in good predictive models is necessary to allow for individual political predictive foresight that is necessary to prevent future catastrophe.

A)	Interpretation:  The aff must increase incentives for/remove restrictions on energy PRODUCTION
Domestic Energy Production requires energy independence
MacLachlan 2007
[Ann, Government calculations correct Royal on nuclear&amp;#39;s 17% share, Nucleonics Week, Lexis]

According to the statistics produced by the observatory for 2006, France&amp;#39;s total domestic production of primary energy was 138.1 mtoe, of which 117.3 mtoe was nuclear power ? the lion&amp;#39;s share of the 50.5% of domestic energy production that is defined as France&amp;#39;s energy independence rate.

B)	Violation – The affirmative does not increase incentives for energy production because it just recycles left overs from current energy production
C)	Standards
1)	Ground – We can’t get links to increases in energy production. They can claim to just solve for the disads to nuclear energy without actually increasing the amount of nuke power produced. This means we don’t disad links or K links.
2)	BiDirectionality – They allow the topic to bidirectional because they actually decrease energy production. They allow for recycling which gets rid of a nuke power byproduct, and doesn’t actually change status quo production.
3)	Education – This topic is different from other energy topics because it is a question of production. This would have been the topical aff in 2004, it does not even attempt to increase production, they only increase recycling, which would not cause an increase in production. And even if it did, that makes them FX topical which kills ground and fairness and making it impossible to win on the negative.
D)	Voters
Topicality is a voting issue for jurisdiction, ground and predictability.

Waste is converted to energy and then is wasted under the sign of efficiency.  This is the parody of energy production that modern warfare and absolute destruction possible. 

Stoekl in 2007

The answer, I think, is to be found in the nature of the

And, the aff feeds a modern economy built on waste and ecological destruction that is distinct from sacrificial expenditure. Increases in nuclear energy production are at an end and the corresponding energy famine is imminent. 

Stoekl in 2007
(Allan, professor of French and comparative literature at Penn State University, “Bataille’s Peak: Energy, Religion, and Postsustainability”, p. 118-119, rcheek)

This is not to say, of course, that there is not an enormous

steep increase, along with the attendant social upheavals implied by this decline.
And, hyper-consumerism is not our potlatch. Waste based on the consumption of energy is an ethics of efficiency and utility that guarantees ecological catastrophe. A new model of expenditure entailing human effort and time rather than the stockpiling of inanimate resources is needed to avoid nuclear apocalypse

Stoekl in 2007
(Allan, professor of French and comparative literature at Penn State University, “Bataille’s Peak: Energy, Religion, and Postsustainability”, p. 57-59, rcheek)

Bataille, then, should have distinguished more clearly between intimate and impersonal varieties of

but the movement of bodies in transport, in ecstasy, in despair?
The alternative is expenditure without reserve.
The ballot is a choice between a restricted economy that entails the ego-driven affirmation of utility that risks cataclysmic destruction and a general economy that affirms energy expenditure without reserve. 

Stoekl in 2007
(Allan, professor of French and comparative literature at Penn State University, “Bataille’s Peak: Energy, Religion, and Postsustainability”, p. 49-50, rcheek)

This restricted economy, which hypostatizes limits (moral, personal) only ultimately to

entails their transgression at the “highest” point of development and knowledge).
And, the most significant problem of our time is not the scarcity of resources, but the abundance of wealth. The problem of plenty is either resolved in extravagant expenditure, or the hoarding of energy reinvested in killing machines and nuclear annihilation. Our choice, then, is either glorious excess, or nothing.

Stoekl in 2007

At that time The Accursed Share, which argued that the main problem confronting society

Our question now becomes, in what fashion does this expenditure take place?  Energy must be held sacred, expended in the instant that leads nowhere.  It is in the instant of uselessness that sovereignty is attained.
Eggington in 2008
(William, Chair and Andrew W Mellon Professor in the Humanities German and Romance Languages and Literatures The Johns Hopkins University, “Batailleâ€™s Peak: Energy, Religion, and Postsustainability (review)”, symploke, Volume 16, Numbers 1-2, 2008, pp. 346-348, pMUSE, rcheek)

In this book, Alan Stoekl argues that Georges Bataille’s theories of energy and religion 
AND
anyone or anything else: sovereign, in Bataille’s sense. (xiii)

However, for the affirmative, energy production is profane.  Rather than be made an intimate religious experience, energy and its expenditure have been put to work through a mechanized process of utility that renders intimacy impossible. The raw passion of life is turned into a standing reserve, a thing among other things, which enables its destruction.

Stoekl in 2007
(Allan, professor of French and comparative literature at Penn State University, “Bataille’s Peak: Energy, Religion, and Postsustainability”, p. 55-57, rcheek)

The answer, I think, is to be found in the nature of the 
AND
which the person has been transformed in and through death, have disappeared.

We must restore expenditure to the realm of the sacred.  This operates in opposition to a restricted economy based on the tenets of utility and calculations that deprive humanity of its sovereignty.  Such an economy reduces energy to a thing so as to exercise dominion.  This denial of the animality of existence separates humanity from itself and makes life a profane denial  of itself – turns the case and guarantees extinction

Biles in 2011
(Jeremy, PhD from the University of Chicago Divinity School, “The Remains of God: Bataille/Sacrifice/Community”, Culture, Theory and Critique, 2011, 52(2–3), 127–144, rcheek)

All such expenditures – useless, diverted from any utilitarian ends –¶ obviously ‘go 
AND
when it lives in immanence’, or continuity (Hollier 1998: 65).


This mortal anxiety establishes an ascetic hatred of the world that denies life.  The only escape is through a chaotic embrace of life.

Turlani in 2003
(Aydan, Department of Humanities and Social Sciences Faculty of Letters and Sciences 
Istanbul Technical University, “Nietzsche and the Later Wittgenstein: An Offense to the Quest for Another World”, The Journal of Nietzsche Studies, 26 (2003), 55-63)

The craving for absolutely general specifications results in doing metaphysics. Unlike Wittgenstein, Nietzsche 
AND
the way out of the fly-bottle&amp;#34; (PI §309). 
The alternative is to sacrifice the 1AC.
Politics operates from a standpoint of reason.  This profane world of utility denies the possibility of intimate expenditure.  We must sacrifice the God of reason to restore sovereignty. In being destroyed, we render the 1AC useless, which frees us from servility to instrumental utility.

Biles in 2011
(Jeremy, PhD from the University of Chicago Divinity School, “The Remains of God: Bataille/Sacrifice/Community”, Culture, Theory and Critique, 2011, 52(2–3), 127–144, rcheek)

The anxious desire for durability corresponds to a demeaning substantialisation¶ of the sacred. 
AND
undergoes a fleeting experience of dissolution¶ in the realm of the sacred.

Refuse their education curriculum. It’s hatred of chance enslaves us to utility. The sacrificial curriculum of the alternative is a an embrace of the rupture of unreasoned life that opens spaces for desire.

Sirc in 1996

What Lingis feels in his journeys in Honduras is a sense of two worlds, 
AND
going out; they have¶ a certain amount of control over that.


The affirmative embraces a God of Reason that must be sacrificed. We are a new pedagogy of heterogeneity that transgresses possibility and radically opposes debates educational stagnation 

Sirc in 1996

What Bataille wants-the laceration, the communication of loss, the¶ ecstasy
AND
sacred and its replacement by an other worldly deity&amp;#34; (Comay 69).


The affirmatives endorsement of utility forces us to profane ourselves, our bodies, and our world – by installing a composition that centers on the contemporary project of advancement, we enable the destruction of sovereignty and life.

Jean-Luc Nancy addresses Bataille’s notion of sacrifice in his seminal 1983 text¶ 
AND
specifically the ‘ordeal of seeing communism betrayed’¶ (1991a: 16).

Impacts
They say extinction – they haven’t isolated a specific instance – we have won an internal link turn to these arguments

We are already dead. Means there is no impact to the aff. Vote neg on presumption.

Bahder in 2007
(Paul, Medical Doctor, “We Are Already Dead”, http://www.homeopathyusa.com/we_are_already_dead.htm, rcheek)

What we call “our life” is really the experience that takes place in 
AND
time. Time has no entrance into eternal even though eternal permeates time.


Our biles evidence impacts this with the question of sovereignty.  To reduce expenditure to nothing more than a means to accomplish a goal reduces it to a thing among other things.  A tool is a hand is a tool.  We are nothing more than kogs set to accomplish tasks set forth by the God of the modern era – Reason.  This establishes life as a standing reserve and makes it just as disposable as the solar panels Reagan stripped from the roof of the whitehouse.

The second impact is asceticism – I believe the link can only be magnified by the 1AC’s focus on the past – Turlani explains the imagning of “what if”, of a better world, of a world where perhaps Carter won the election, or where Reagan actually funded the Solar Bank – this constant what if imaging engenders a hatred for the world we have.  All along while we were imagning how beautiful the sun set could be, the sun rose behind our backs but we were too busy facing the other way and missed it.  

The final impact is curriculum

A2 – Finite
The gift of the sun is one without return. It gives without receiving and as such, the surface of the globe is abound with an abundance of solar energy.  This energy is always already in a state of constant production and expenditure by all forms of life.  

Stoekl in 2007

Indeed, these assumptions are among those most contested by current energy theorists and experts
AND
have to be burned off. There will always be too much life. 

A2 – Life Matters

Its about the frame – theirs is one of restriction that precludes openness to loss – recognition that life is merely an explosion of energy strips us of the fear
Stoekl in 2007
(Allan, professor of French and comparative literature at Penn State University, “Bataille’s Peak: Energy, Religion, and Postsustainability”, p. 189-191, rcheek)

“Expenditure without return” is a floating concept, defined in opposition to the

ongoing, and climate-change-independent wounding of life on Earth.

The apocalyptic imagining of climate change produces technological or treaty fixes which leave the root cause of environment destruction and makes other environmental problems seem acceptable and allows for species elimination, ocean destruction, deforestation, and other problems

While the dangers of climate change are real, I argue that there are even

Our question now becomes, in what fashion does this expenditure take place?  Energy must be held sacred, expended in the instant that leads nowhere.  It is in the instant of uselessness that sovereignty is attained.
Eggington in 2008
(William, Chair and Andrew W Mellon Professor in the Humanities German and Romance Languages and Literatures The Johns Hopkins University, “Batailleâ€™s Peak: Energy, Religion, and Postsustainability (review)”, symploke, Volume 16, Numbers 1-2, 2008, pp. 346-348, pMUSE, rcheek)

In this book, Alan Stoekl argues that Georges Bataille’s theories of energy and religion 
AND
anyone or anything else: sovereign, in Bataille’s sense. (xiii)

However, for the affirmative, energy production is profane.  Rather than be made an intimate religious experience, energy and its expenditure have been put to work through a mechanized process of utility that renders intimacy impossible. The raw passion of life is turned into a standing reserve, a thing among other things, which enables its destruction.

Stoekl in 2007
(Allan, professor of French and comparative literature at Penn State University, “Bataille’s Peak: Energy, Religion, and Postsustainability”, p. 55-57, rcheek)

The answer, I think, is to be found in the nature of the 
AND
which the person has been transformed in and through death, have disappeared.

We must restore expenditure to the realm of the sacred.  This operates in opposition to a restricted economy based on the tenets of utility and calculations that deprive humanity of its sovereignty.  Such an economy reduces energy to a thing so as to exercise dominion.  This denial of the animality of existence separates humanity from itself and makes life a profane denial  of itself – turns the case and guarantees extinction

(Jeremy, PhD from the University of Chicago Divinity School, “The Remains of God: Bataille/Sacrifice/Community”, Culture, Theory and Critique, 2011, 52(2–3), 127–144, rcheek)

All such expenditures – useless, diverted from any utilitarian ends –¶ obviously ‘go 
AND
when it lives in immanence’, or continuity (Hollier 1998: 65).


This mortal anxiety establishes an ascetic hatred of the world that denies life.  The only escape is through a chaotic embrace of life.

(Aydan, Department of Humanities and Social Sciences Faculty of Letters and Sciences 
Istanbul Technical University, “Nietzsche and the Later Wittgenstein: An Offense to the Quest for Another World”, The Journal of Nietzsche Studies, 26 (2003), 55-63)

The craving for absolutely general specifications results in doing metaphysics. Unlike Wittgenstein, Nietzsche 
AND
the way out of the fly-bottle&amp;#34; (PI §309). 
The alternative is to sacrifice the 1AC.
Politics operates from a standpoint of reason.  This profane world of utility denies the possibility of intimate expenditure.  We must sacrifice the God of reason to restore sovereignty. In being destroyed, we render the 1AC useless, which frees us from servility to instrumental utility.

Biles in 2011
(Jeremy, PhD from the University of Chicago Divinity School, “The Remains of God: Bataille/Sacrifice/Community”, Culture, Theory and Critique, 2011, 52(2–3), 127–144, rcheek)

The anxious desire for durability corresponds to a demeaning substantialisation¶ of the sacred. 
AND
undergoes a fleeting experience of dissolution¶ in the realm of the sacred.

Refuse their education curriculum. It’s hatred of chance enslaves us to utility. The sacrificial curriculum of the alternative is a an embrace of the rupture of unreasoned life that opens spaces for desire.
