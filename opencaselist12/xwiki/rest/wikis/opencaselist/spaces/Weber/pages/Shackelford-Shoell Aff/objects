reactors have been-http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-03-07/california-nuclear-backlash-mounts-after-japan-meltdown-energy.html relicensed. No applications for license renewal have been rejected.

In the partial meltdown at Three Mile Island in 1979, the cooling system failed

At the same time, however, the implications of both trends for human society

==Advantage 2 is Space==

====Pu-238 is critical for deep space missions and NASA is running out. Without more, the space program will collapse and the U.S. will cease to be the leader in space.  Up to now, the only way Pu-238 could be created was as a byproduct of nuclear warhead production.====

For 50 years, NASA has used plutonium-238 as the fuel source for

Each metric tonne of thorium consumed in a LFTR could produce:¶ 9900 GWe*

With this approach, plutonium from weapons and reactor fuel will start about 70 chloride
