First, Feed-in Tariffs are the most effective policy for renewable energy growth, but have not been instituted nationally in the U.S.

FITs have not been instituted nationally in the United States even though the U.
AND
a number of international solar firms moving factories specifically to that Canadian province.

And, the lack of a national FiT has led to fractured state policies that can’t solve

(D.A., EnergyTrend, “U.S. Feed-in Tariffs will Increase PV Demand”, 5-16-12, http://www.energytrend.com/Barber_PV_20120516, rcheek)

Instead of FITs, 31 of the 50 U.S. states have passed 
AND
been avid opposition from electric utility companies in many states to enacting FITs.¶ 

And, the U.S. needs a national FiT to incentivize clean energy production

Advantage One: Energy Democratization
First, FiTs cause a paradigm shift toward the democratization of energy

Because of these obvious benefits, some U.S. municipal utilities are actually

Advantage Two: Economy
First, FiTs are key to economic growth. Three internals: increases investor confidence, boosts manufacturing industry, and creates jobs.

The relationship of poverty, inequality, and economic growth with violent conflict has direct

Introducing policy change in these environments is not an easy or straightforward task.

And, poverty is the root cause of every impact – it causes disease spread, terrorism, environmental destruction, failed states and civil conflict.

effective action by states everywhere is necessary to reduce and combat transnational threats.   
Advantage Three: Warming
First, FiTs must be implemented in less than a decade to solve warming

Mendonça, Jacobs, and Sovacool in 2010

Why do we need more well-designed FITs? The Intergovernmental Panel ¶ on 
AND
and will only be needed on a limited basis, if at all. 
And, only FiTs have a chance to achieve a global low-carbon energy infrastructure

During the past decade, there has been remarkable progress in renewable energy policy ¶

(Miguel, Researcher, author and advocate of sustainability and resilience strategies, David, Director Renewable Energy, IFOK GmbH, and Benjamin K., Visiting Associate Professor at Vermont Law School, “Powering the Green Economy: The feed-in tariff handbook”, p. xxi-xxii, rcheek)

One of the most urgent questions for policy makers dealing with FITs is how to 
AND
there be ¶ an economic incentive to invest in cleaner forms of energy. 
And, FiTs setup a policy framework that promotes all renewable energy technologies

Mendonça, Jacobs, and Sovacool in 2010
(Miguel, Researcher, author and advocate of sustainability and resilience strategies, David, Director Renewable Energy, IFOK GmbH, and Benjamin K., Visiting Associate Professor at Vermont Law School, “Powering the Green Economy: The feed-in tariff handbook”, p. xxiii-xxv, rcheek)

The good news is that this book is full of dozens of examples where leading

And, FiTs should start as a simple mechanism to invite all parts of society to become electricity producers

Mendonça, Jacobs, and Sovacool in 2010
(Miguel, Researcher, author and advocate of sustainability and resilience strategies, David, Director Renewable Energy, IFOK GmbH, and Benjamin K., Visiting Associate Professor at Vermont Law School, “Powering the Green Economy: The feed-in tariff handbook”, p. 15-16, rcheek)

In countries with a relatively short history of renewable energy development, ¶ and those

begin with the most basic element of any FIT programme, eligible technologies. 

Finally, federal action is key. Lack of a national FiT has led to a state system that is insolvent.

Contention One: Hubbert’s Peak
First, status quo fossil fuel production turns life into a standing reserve. Energy is wasted under the sign of efficiency making modern warfare and absolute destruction possible. 

Stoekl in 2007
(Allan, professor of French and comparative literature at Penn State University, “Bataille’s Peak: Energy, Religion, and Postsustainability”, p. 55-57, rcheek)

The answer, I think, is to be found in the nature of the 
AND
which the person has been transformed in and through death, have disappeared.
And, modern economies are built on waste and ecological destruction that is distinct from sacrificial expenditure. Increases in fossil fuel energy production are at an end and the corresponding energy famine is imminent. 

Stoekl in 2007
(Allan, professor of French and comparative literature at Penn State University, “Bataille’s Peak: Energy, Religion, and Postsustainability”, p. 118-119, rcheek)

This is not to say, of course, that there is not an enormous 
AND
steep increase, along with the attendant social upheavals implied by this decline.
And, fossil fuels are being depleted, but solar energy is always in excess. Continued dependence on scarce resources risks civilizational collapse, mass die-off, and a return to feudalism

Stoekl in 2007
(Allan, professor of French and comparative literature at Penn State University, “Bataille’s Peak: Energy, Religion, and Postsustainability”, p. 42, rcheek)

We can argue, then, that solar energy is indeed always produced, always 
AND
-distant future, have to be replaced by real, human slaves.
And, hyper-consumerism is not our potlatch. Waste based on the consumption of fossil fuels is an ethics of efficiency and utility that guarantees ecological catastrophe. A new model of expenditure entailing human effort and time rather than the stockpiling of inanimate resources is needed to avoid nuclear apocalypse

Stoekl in 2007
(Allan, professor of French and comparative literature at Penn State University, “Bataille’s Peak: Energy, Religion, and Postsustainability”, p. 57-59, rcheek)

Bataille, then, should have distinguished more clearly between intimate and impersonal varieties of 
AND
but the movement of bodies in transport, in ecstasy, in despair?
Contention Two: Bataille’s Peak

First, expenditure is the universal tendency of existence toward the excessive production of energy.

Eggington in 2008
(William, Chair and Andrew W Mellon Professor in the Humanities German and Romance Languages and Literatures The Johns Hopkins University, “Batailleâ€™s Peak: Energy, Religion, and Postsustainability (review)”, symploke, Volume 16, Numbers 1-2, 2008, pp. 346-348, pMUSE, rcheek)

In this book, Alan Stoekl argues that Georges Bataille’s theories of energy and religion 
AND
anyone or anything else: sovereign, in Bataille’s sense. (xiii)
And, modern consumerism is a deluded form of expenditure. Sustainability becomes the mantra of all those who would respond to the decline of the fossil fuel economy. This renounces the sacrificial expenditure of intimate solar energy necessary to transition into a post-sustainable world

Stoekl in 2007
(Allan, professor of French and comparative literature at Penn State University, “Bataille’s Peak: Energy, Religion, and Postsustainability”, p. 119-122, rcheek)

How to respond? Clearly, lowered expectations are in order, or so it 
AND
and the difference— and also minor connection—between waste and expenditure.
And, the ballot is a choice between a restricted economy that entails the ego-driven affirmation of utility that risks cataclysmic destruction and a general economy that entails the affirmation of energy expenditure without reserve. 

Stoekl in 2007
(Allan, professor of French and comparative literature at Penn State University, “Bataille’s Peak: Energy, Religion, and Postsustainability”, p. 49-50, rcheek)

This restricted economy, which hypostatizes limits (moral, personal) only ultimately to 
AND
entails their transgression at the “highest” point of development and knowledge).
And, the most significant problem of our time is not the scarcity of resources, but the abundance of wealth. The problem of plenty is either resolved in extravagant expenditure, or the hoarding of energy reinvested in killing machines and nuclear annihilation. Our choice, then, is either glorious excess, or nothing.

Stoekl in 2007
(Allan, professor of French and comparative literature at Penn State University, “Bataille’s Peak: Energy, Religion, and Postsustainability”, p. 117, rcheek)

At that time The Accursed Share, which argued that the main problem confronting society 
AND
, but also a more terrifying one, than that foreseen by Orwell.
Advocacy
We affirm the intimate expenditure of solar power. 

Contention Three: Post-Sustainability
And, solar power is a gift without reserve that articulates a form of self-sacrificing sovereignty distinct from the unthinking waste of modern consumerism.

Wernick in 2009
(Andrew, Emeritus Professor of Cultural Studies and Sociology at Trent University in Canada, “Greened Bataille”, Topia 21, 231-235, rcheek)

Stoekl’s answer is multi-levelled. First, in a fascinating opening essay on 
AND
thinking toward, put some social and economic flesh on the conceptual bones.
And, the sun gives energy without return, in excess of what is needed to sustain life. From the perspective of the general economy, the most important question for us to answer is how to expend the surplus that constantly flows through us.

Wernick in 2009
(Andrew, Emeritus Professor of Cultural Studies and Sociology at Trent University in Canada, “Greened Bataille”, Topia 21, 231-235, rcheek)

Bataille’s Peak is refreshing both in its ambition and its approach. Rather than appropriate 
AND
offer concerning all that is gathered together in the current worry about sustainability?
And, expenditure without return functions in opposition to a restricted economy. As an explosion of energy, the human being has the responsibility to spend in glory what is scattered by the sun. Our ethics valorize gift giving over nuclear war and ritual sacrifice over consumerist waste. 

Stoekl in 2007
(Allan, professor of French and comparative literature at Penn State University, “Bataille’s Peak: Energy, Religion, and Postsustainability”, p. 189-191, rcheek)

“Expenditure without return” is a floating concept, defined in opposition to the 
AND
will guarantee the status of a certain act or of a certain politics.

And, our affirmation of an intimate world of expenditure is not a return to feudalism. It is a transgression of the finitude of fossil fuels that opposes the dominion of energy that “does work”

Stoekl in 2007
(Allan, professor of French and comparative literature at Penn State University, “Bataille’s Peak: Energy, Religion, and Postsustainability”, p. 198-200, rcheek)

And this fall teaches us of another incarnation of God, another incarnation of Man
AND
. Depletion and expenditure, Hubbert’s peak and Bataille’s peak, converge.33

And, postsustainability is an unintended consequence of expenditure. What is sustained is not a subjectivity that slices up a depletable world, but an unplanned aftereffect of the tendency to expend. We sustain ourselves not as conservers but as profligate spenders of the energy of the universe.

Stoekl in 2007
(Allan, professor of French and comparative literature at Penn State University, “Bataille’s Peak: Energy, Religion, and Postsustainability”, p. 143-144, rcheek)

This energy, however, has little to do with that put to use in 
AND
inefficiency, in the squandering of time, of effort, of focus.

(“FEEDING APOLLO EATING DIONYSUS - a matrimony to the self”, transcribed from http://vimeo.com/11930473, rcheek)
I have a story, just for you. I bet you wonder who I am, where I come from, what’s my plan. But there is one thing you should know: it does not matter what’s my name, for we can play a little game. What about a round of chess, then I will let you have a guess, on who is the winner, who’s to lose, pre-decided, or you [to] choose? Is there a good guy and a bad, between the white king and the black? Opposing kingdoms, that’s a fact. The rest of you my dear fools, are pawns following the rules, soldiers in your Christened name, defending an imaginary reign. 

My favorite time of the day, it’s the morning, beautiful the mornings are. I open the window and smell the fresh air. I fill up my lungs until they burst like party balloons, then I exhale slowly, and smoothly, and turn my attention to the beat of my heart. For once again, I realize that I’m alive, what a beautiful feeling alive is. I carefully shut the window wet from the reborn June and then I march toward my pristine bathroom. Absolute gleam and sparkle spread before my reborn eyes. I step into my alabaster shower, and I allow the steaming water to rinse away the remains of the dawn. Now, I am prepared for a new day, cleansed. Sometimes, I look at myself.
Just so you know, I come from far. A territory of spit and tar. My rival has a request, for those of you in a quest to find a purpose and a meaning. The ones that look for more than breeding. Want to recognize their face, to hear their voice, to know their place. And it’s a question that has been throughout the centuries of being. Many have planted, no result. They try and seek if it’s their fault. They live. They die. Through fire and thunder, but their question still, a wonder.

I wake up in the night. Its either the dreams, or the fear. Fear of death. While I am sinking in my silky sheets. The abyss swallows me. I’m falling in deep waters, but I never swim. I don’t want to be saved, and this scares me the most. I stay still, I let go, I surrender, in this sweet evaporation. This is when I jump out of bed, fast heart beat, cold sweat, shivering. Other times, it’s the dreams, I’m alone. Naked, dancing, in a field. An endless field. I cover a great distance. Miles and miles lost in the frenzy of my dancing. On my hands, bracelets of ivy leaves. My hair in an unusual shade of gold. Its not me. At least not the person I’m familiar with. I’m ecstatic. Sometimes, I look at myself.
Am I here to solve the mystery. Feeding you, conceited victory, you mortals are, you mortal fool. My answer will be very cruel. The question you are now asking, I answered once, while I was husking a piece of fruit I found in an ancient forest on Crete. But I was caught, the only time, and shivers crawled down my spine. It was King Midas, foolish wretch, his human touch led me to [twitch]. He asked in impudence and worthiness, what is [hu]man’s greatest happiness. I stared into his coward eyes, his trembling hands. His knees, his thighs. I couldn’t keep back, it would be rough, and so I break into a shrill laugh, HAHAHAHA, what’s best for you is beyond your reach, just throw yourself into a ditch. You should wish never to be born. You should wish quickly to be torn. The second best is to die soon, pray for that all day noon. Within the body, lies the will. Hungry reality, no god to help, source of desire that never ends. Source of all suffering that condemns the human race. To be in vain, existing only to feel pain. 

Sometimes, I feel it overwhelms me. Warm, thick, overflowing slowly, methodically from the pours of my skull. Merging with my hair, descending on my temples and hugging gently my eyelashes. It covers my eyes, they’re shut. The brown bisques juice now targets my pupils and returns to my insides. Slides in the eyelids, and bursts pompously in the avenues. Veins and arteries, the essential streets. Mother, mother remember me, remember my name. Mother, look at me. Listen, listen to my voice. I had fever, remember? You touched my burning forehead and said everything would be alright, since then I am always in fever. I’m always crossing my chest 3 times before I go to sleep. I’m always knocking on wood when things go wrong. I never leave the closet open, its bad luck. I never cut my nails after eight o’clock, my family will die. Butter beans are poisonous, they turn your blood to water… Sometimes, I look at myself.
The ancient greeks learned the truth, however terribly uncouth, they have to find a way to bare, to hid the anguish and despair, so here he comes in blinding light, the god of sun, of dream, of might. Reason and order are his ways. Noble beauty floods his gaze. His civilized nature is sworn, proportion optimism born. Apollo, his divine name, and moderation, his [game], fortifies against the tether, that is disguised fatal error. The pile of [hu]man that lies within, ready to hit, to punch, to scream. In human psyche he is sealed, so can he be muzzled or concealed? The wisdom needed to admit, that human dark side is a gift. The greeks had heard after awhile, and so they called him full of rile, he brings his wine, emphatic dance. Fantasy, violence, intoxication, unreason, no appreciation. He loved with death and so he feeds, sensual body, and its needs. In the name, Dionysus he responds, carries along, primitive bonds. Through him the suffering is based, glorified, celebrated place. His culture is the one to ban the ways of the civilized [hu]man. 

I count my fingers. They have five on each hand. Sometimes, I have the sense that they are seven. Maybe nine, and less often, three. I blink, keeping my eyes hooked on my palms, I blink once. There’s still seven. I squeeze my eyes, until my upper eyelashes blend with the lower. And then I open them wide, expecting a malady, just to realize that I count there’s seven. Seven fingers on the right hand and seven fingers on the left. After a while, I get bored. I give up. I’m used to it now. It used to scare me. To freak me out. Not anymore, at least not as much. I forgot to mention, the nails, bellows, blood, and love. As long as my fingers, all seven of them, with those nails, I could hunt you down. I could rip you apart. I could suck on your spleen, I could hurt you piece by piece and leave you to rot in a nonexistent place that no one would ever find. Because, you belong to my head. My beautiful, powerful, remorseful, head. Sometimes, I look at myself. 
I ask once and for all. The words I’ve spoken, I record. Is there a black king and a white, with only one to win the fight? Or are they both trapped inside your souls, playing around and swapping roles? In what you hear, and what you see, you’ll find your answers, not from me. I’m just a satyr, and not an oracle, nor a prophet. It’s up to you my little mice, to shake like darts, or roll the dice. 
Expend in glory, what is scattered by Apollo. A gift without return, cannot wait until tomorrow. Affirm the intimate expenditure of solar power. Dionysus has returned, and all should cower.

The gift of the sun is one without return. It gives without receiving and as such, the surface of the globe is abound with an abundance of solar energy.  This energy is always already in a state of constant production and expenditure by all forms of life.  

Stoekl in 2007
(Allan, professor of French and comparative literature at Penn State University, “Bataille’s Peak: Energy, Religion, and Postsustainability”, p. 39-40, rcheek)

Indeed, these assumptions are among those most contested by current energy theorists and experts
AND
have to be burned off. There will always be too much life. 

Expenditure is the universal tendency of existence toward the excessive production of energy.  Our question now becomes, in what fashion does this expenditure take place?  Energy must be held sacred, expended in the instant that leads nowhere.  It is in the instant of uselessness that sovereignty is attained.
Eggington in 2008
(William, Chair and Andrew W Mellon Professor in the Humanities German and Romance Languages and Literatures The Johns Hopkins University, “Batailleâ€™s Peak: Energy, Religion, and Postsustainability (review)”, symploke, Volume 16, Numbers 1-2, 2008, pp. 346-348, pMUSE, rcheek)

In this book, Alan Stoekl argues that Georges Bataille’s theories of energy and religion 
AND
anyone or anything else: sovereign, in Bataille’s sense. (xiii)

However, status quo energy production is profane.  Rather than be made an intimate religious experience, energy and its expenditure have been put to work through a mechanized process of utility that renders intimacy impossible.  The raw passion of life is turned into a standing reserve, a thing among other things, which enables its destruction.

Stoekl in 2007
(Allan, professor of French and comparative literature at Penn State University, “Bataille’s Peak: Energy, Religion, and Postsustainability”, p. 55-57, rcheek)

The answer, I think, is to be found in the nature of the 
AND
which the person has been transformed in and through death, have disappeared.

The useless and radically anti-utilitarian ethic of the 1AC restore expenditure to the realm of the sacred.  This operates in opposition to a restricted economy based on the tenets of utility and calculations that deprive humanity of its sovereignty.  Such an economy reduces energy to a thing so as to exercise dominion.  This denial of the animality of existence separates humanity from itself and makes life a profane denial  of itself.

Biles in 2011
(Jeremy, PhD from the University of Chicago Divinity School, “The Remains of God: Bataille/Sacrifice/Community”, Culture, Theory and Critique, 2011, 52(2–3), 127–144, rcheek)

All such expenditures – useless, diverted from any utilitarian ends –¶ obviously ‘go 
AND
when it lives in immanence’, or continuity (Hollier 1998: 65).


This mortal anxiety establishes an ascetic hatred of the world that denies life.  The only escape is through a chaotic embrace of life.

Turlani in 2003
(Aydan, Department of Humanities and Social Sciences Faculty of Letters and Sciences 
Istanbul Technical University, “Nietzsche and the Later Wittgenstein: An Offense to the Quest for Another World”, The Journal of Nietzsche Studies, 26 (2003), 55-63)

The craving for absolutely general specifications results in doing metaphysics. Unlike Wittgenstein, Nietzsche 
AND
the way out of the fly-bottle&amp;#34; (PI §309). 

And, hyper-consumerism is not our potlatch – It entails a stock-piled self that is still reliant upon a static conception of energy as product and not religion.  The affirmation of intimate expenditure counters this stockpiled self and puts at risk the stability energy and subjectivity.  The irony of this reckless abandon is that it creates a post-sustainable aftereffect more capable of sustaining life than a restricted economy.

Stoekl in 2007
(Allan, professor of French and comparative literature at Penn State University, “Bataille’s Peak: Energy, Religion, and Postsustainability”, p. 57-59, rcheek)

Bataille, then, should have distinguished more clearly between intimate and impersonal varieties of 
AND
but the movement of bodies in transport, in ecstasy, in despair?
Therefore, the ballot represents a choice between two economies of energy production:  The status quo represents a restricted economy of productivity of which the quintessential nature is endless violence while an affirmative ballot endorses a general economy of sacred expenditure.   

Biles in 2011
(Jeremy, PhD from the University of Chicago Divinity School, “The Remains of God: Bataille/Sacrifice/Community”, Culture, Theory and Critique, 2011, 52(2–3), 127–144, rcheek)

The core of this betrayal lay in communism’s negation of human ‘sovereignty’,¶ a 
AND
tears, artistic and poetic¶ exudations, and various forms of intoxication.

Contention Two is Sacrificing God
Politics operates from a standpoint of reason, fear of death, and securing a future.  This profane world of utility upholds such values as a transcendent God that denies the possibility of intimate expenditure.  We must sacrifice the God of reason to restore sovereignty. In being destroyed, we render it useless, which frees us from servility to instrumental utility.

Biles in 2011
(Jeremy, PhD from the University of Chicago Divinity School, “The Remains of God: Bataille/Sacrifice/Community”, Culture, Theory and Critique, 2011, 52(2–3), 127–144, rcheek)

The anxious desire for durability corresponds to a demeaning substantialisation¶ of the sacred. 
AND
undergoes a fleeting experience of dissolution¶ in the realm of the sacred.



This sacrifice is a utility of non-utility – far from a quest for masterful control of the resolution, our ecstatic abandonment of it ruptures restricted economies that lash out in exclusionary and violent ways to establish a true moment of communal unity
Biles in 2011
(Jeremy, PhD from the University of Chicago Divinity School, “The Remains of God: Bataille/Sacrifice/Community”, Culture, Theory and Critique, 2011, 52(2–3), 127–144, rcheek)

In this sense, then, a sacrifice is always a sacrifice of God, 
AND
¶ the closed, individual self as formed through social prohibitions and work.

We sacrifice the God of reason that enslaves us as instruments of work. Only voting affirmative frees you from the domain of utility that the resolution has elevated to a metaphysical beyond.  Use reason against itself and vote affirmative as a counter-operation to the status quo.

Biles in 2011
(Jeremy, PhD from the University of Chicago Divinity School, “The Remains of God: Bataille/Sacrifice/Community”, Culture, Theory and Critique, 2011, 52(2–3), 127–144, rcheek)

This communication, this ecstatic and often tormenting loss of self in continuity¶ with 
AND
the refusal to put off existence in some beyond (1988: 47).
Thus we ask you to vote affirmative to sacrifice the resolution.

Contention Three Is Curriculum
Refuse debate’s traditional curriculum. It’s hatred of chance enslaves us to utility. The sacrificial curriculum of the affirmative is a an embrace of the rupture of unreasoned life that opens spaces for desire.

Sirc in 1996
(Geoffrey, Ph.D.: Composition Theory, University of Minnesota, “Godless Composition, Tormented Writing”, http://jaconlinejournal.com/archives/vol15.3/sirc-godless.pdf, rcheek)

What Lingis feels in his journeys in Honduras is a sense of two worlds, 
AND
going out; they have¶ a certain amount of control over that.



The resolution embraces a God of Reason that must be sacrificed. We are a new pedagogy of heterogeneity that transgresses possibility and radically opposes debates educational stagnation 

Sirc in 1996
(Geoffrey, Ph.D.: Composition Theory, University of Minnesota, “Godless Composition, Tormented Writing”, http://jaconlinejournal.com/archives/vol15.3/sirc-godless.pdf, rcheek)

What Bataille wants-the laceration, the communication of loss, the¶ ecstasy
AND
sacred and its replacement by an other worldly deity&amp;#34; (Comay 69).


The resolution forces us to profane ourselves, our bodies, and our world – by installing a composition that centers on the contemporary project of technological advancement, we enable the destruction of sovereignty and life.  

Sirc in 1996
(Geoffrey, Ph.D.: Composition Theory, University of Minnesota, “Godless Composition, Tormented Writing”, http://jaconlinejournal.com/archives/vol15.3/sirc-godless.pdf, rcheek)

Stoekl in 2007

They say we are responsible for what happens in this round and no one can affect future rounds or worlds, this means they have zero offense – any impact to fairness or extra topicality is resolved by future rounds, no unique reason one untopical aff destroys debate.  

It also means we are the only ones with a risk of offense by affirming our own sovereignty within this debate round – all of their standards and assumptions of the burden of rejoinder rely upon an assumption of utility and purpose to the debate round that our Sirc evidence indicates is a profane curriculum that sacrifices students towards the God of reason.

Permutation do both

Sovereignty Disad – they put us to work.
Even the most radical ecologists practice anthropocentrism. A Bataillean ecology can help us to rethink deep ecology by reformulating a critique of the role of the human in nature. The sacrificial relationship between humans and animals is an affirmation of the relatively minor position of humanity in the universe.

Stoekl in 2007

1AC stoekl evidence draws the difference between hyperconsumerism (their link). And Intimate expenditure.

Aff is a disad to the alternative – still establishes a politics of utility that puts us to work – profanes our bodies and sacrifices our sovereignty

Their link isn’t applicable to the 1AC – we are not bataille’s theory of expenditure, we are the method of sacrifice – fundamental no link to sacrificing reason – access a net link turn
Capitalisms ills derive from the confusion of restrained and general economies. Our sacrifice of reason entails spending without regard to the future and a refusal of the use-value of things.

Stoekl in 2007
(Allan, professor of French and comparative literature at Penn State University, “Bataille’s Peak: Energy, Religion, and Postsustainability”, p. 50-51, rcheek)

Bataille’s model in The Accursed Share ultimately depends on a distinction between types of expenditure 
AND
an economic one but an ethical one that criticizes the affirmation of self.

Permutation do both
Marxism is a narrative of mastery and power that makes violence inevitable as the world is decommodified by force and the subject is structured by death. Their alternative causes labor militarization, revolutionary terror and will eradicate of the basic human condition to achieve the telos of overcoming class divisions. 

Mbembe in 2003
(Achille, senior researcher at the Institute of Social and Economic Research at the University of the Witwatersrand, “Necropolitics”, Public Culture 15.1 (2003) 11-40, rcheek)

Finally, terror is not linked solely to the utopian belief in the unfettered power 
AND
of realizing the already known telos of history. End Page 20 

Our ethic of expenditure is fundamentally different from the excesses of hyperconsumerism. Bataillean expenditure is not tied to the maintenance of an energy regime based on stockpiling and quantification, it is the sacrificial expenditure of human energy of the death of God and of Man

Stoekl in 2007
(Allan, professor of French and comparative literature at Penn State University, “Bataille’s Peak: Energy, Religion, and Postsustainability”, p. 136-137, rcheek)

The consequences of the necessary Bataillean revision of Heidegger (or the Heideggerian revision of

Intimate expenditure is not the ultimate celebration of postmodern capitalism. Modern consumerism is the result of a society that has turned its back on expenditure and wastes in the name of utility. 

Stoekl in 2007
(Allan, professor of French and comparative literature at Penn State University, “Bataille’s Peak: Energy, Religion, and Postsustainability”, p. 137-139, rcheek)

This confusion is fundamental because a number of commentators have come to see Bataille’s work
