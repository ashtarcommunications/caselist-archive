First, AFF Solves Warming—&#xD;
1. Bridge technology: CCS provides a short term solution to prevent extreme weather events, that’s essential—no other renewable energy can fill in—that’s Der. &#xD;
2. Negative emissions: biomass facilitates a decrease in past CO2 emitted and halt emissions from current coal plants, that’s Selosse.  &#xD;
3. Coal: CCS is the only mechanism to decrease future emissions from coal plants. The plan creates a market for industrial CO2, lowering our emissions by billions of tons, that’s Claussen. &#xD;
Second, CO2 EOR substantially reduces emissions - You should prefer our ev.  It is based on a life cycle analysis of a fully functional EOR project &#xD;

Permutation: Do both – solves the net benefit

Permutation:  United States federal government should reveal the plan in the Quadrennial Energy Review
QER is exclusively federal actors and is a federal energy policy

When the PCAST, as an external advisory board to … a mechanism for managing this crosscutting¶ challenge.


CP makes status quo efforts now – they 

Permutation: Do the CP – 

a. certainty and immediacy are not in the plan text- counterplan isn’t separate from the mandate of the plan

b. should means desirable
		Cambridge Dictionary of American English, 7 – (http://dictionary.cambridge.org/define.asp?key=should*1+0anddict=A)

		should (DUTY)
		auxiliary verb 
		used to express that it is necessary,…of the following verb

c. severance is justified when counterplans compete off an element of time or certainty- these counterplans are bad for debate


4. Counterplans that allow the possibility of doing the entire plan are a voting issue
a. Kills affirmative ground—debate is rigged for the neg because they can choose the institution they submit the plan to where the literature is on their side—even if we can get offense it relies on us reading new offense in the 2AC that gives them a 13 minute block to answer vs a 5 minute 1AR.
b. Anti-educational—consult counterplans give negatives an incentive to never do any work on the topic because they can always just change the process of the plan and claim arbitrary advantages—this prevents an in-depth examination of the literature.


No net benefit – their politics link argument means that they would say no

Link to the net benefit – if the counterplan results in the passage of the PTC, Obama would still get backlash
