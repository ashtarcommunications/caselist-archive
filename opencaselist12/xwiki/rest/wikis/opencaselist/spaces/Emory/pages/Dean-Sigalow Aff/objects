Contention One: Intangible Energy

What is powering our laptops?  The lights in this building?  The air conditioner and elevators?  What sort of fuel is burning to keep the power plant running?  Where is it from? Who~-~-and what~-~-is hurt by it?  

Most in current society are unable to answer these questions, because energy is  intangible and taken for granted.  We expect power to be there when we plug into an outlet  We don’t worry about where it came from.  

This is a direct result of the design of the centralized energy system we are distanced, geographically and emotionally, from the sources of electricity.  the attendant intangibility of energy makes awareness and sustainability impossible.

Pierce and Paulos, 2010 James Pierce, Eric Paulos, researcher and Cooper-Siegel Endowed Chair at the Human-Computer Interaction Institute, Carnegie Mellon University “Materializing energy”, http://www.paulos.net/papers/2010/MaterializingEnergy_DIS2010.pdf

THE INTANGIBILITY OF ENERGY  A common …collecting, keeping, sharing, and  activating energy.


The result of this intangibility of energy is an untenable relationship between society and the environment.  Because we, as consumers, are alienated from the production of electrical energy, we are willing to ignore environmental consequences and authorize violence in order to ensure an unending, cornucopian supply

Byrne and Toly, 2006 John BYRNE Director Center for Energy and Environmental Policy and Public Policy @ Delaware AND Noah TOLY Research Associate Center for Energy and Environmental Policy ‘6 in Transforming Power eds. Byrne, Toly, and Glover p. 1-3

From climate change to acid rain, contaminated … energy, and considers the discursive continuities between the premises of conventional and sustainable energy futures.

The environmental costs of the traditional power system are massive but ignored.  This destroys the environment and makes renewables uncompetitive.

3. Economic impediments¶ While renewable power sources … much like racing a tricycle against a Ferrari.

This relationship to the energy economy makes massive environmental destruction and species extinction inevitable because of pollution, resource competition, and global warming.  Only a new energy paradigm focused on micro-generation can create change fundamental enough to avert disaster

Rifkin, 2012 Jeremy Rifkin is president of the Foundation on Economic Trends and the bestselling author of nineteen books on the impact of scientific and technological changes on the economy, the workforce, society, and the environment. His books have been translated into more than thirty five languages and are used in hundreds of universities, corporations and government agencies around the world. His most recent books includeThe Third Industrial Revolution, The Empathic Civilization, The Hydrogen Economy, The European Dream, The End of Work, The Age of Access, and The Biotech Century.  Jeremy Rifkin has been an adviser to the European Union for the past decade and is the principle architect of the European Union’s Third Industrial Revolution long-term economic sustainability plan.. “The third Industrial Revolution”.

Individual humans are for the most part insulated … specter of massive human destruction. 

Their species defense arguments are wrong – resiliency is only possible given long time-frames and freedom from artificial intervention – consensus of scientists proves that species loss will devastate global ecosystems and threaten human survival 
WILSON 02 Professor of Environmental Biology at Harvard

People commonly respond to the evidence of species … where biodiversity is both the richest and most threatened. 

Warming is real, anthropogenic, and causes extinction

The twenty-first century heralds the unprecedented …polarisation that can culminate in violent conflict.

Specific scenarios should receive less weight than social goals.  Expert specificity is more vulnerable to short-term thinking and bias in favor of existing interests.

Anticipative strategies in general help to … protected environments, transition arenas (Meadowcroft 2005).

The Plan
PLAN:  The United States Federal Government should substantially increase financial incentives for community-planned solar energy production.

Contention two—Empowered Communities
Distributed generation has the potential to create a sustainable energy paradigm or it can uphold existing institutions – framing is key
Pierce and Paulos, 2010 James Pierce, Eric Paulos, researcher and Cooper-Siegel Endowed Chair at the  Human-Computer Interaction Institute, Carnegie Mellon University “Materializing energy”, http://www.paulos.net/papers/2010/MaterializingEnergy_DIS2010.pdf
Our approach is grounded in a belief that sustainable  … those capable of being sustained. 5

Framing shapes politics

Expressing progressive political ideas and values … explicit in order to improve political debate.
An overt political challenge is a necessary component of this strategy.  The plan’s confrontation with status quo energy elites galvanizes broader environmental movements.  

Scrase and Smith, 2009 Ivan SCRASE Science and Technology Policy Research @ Sussex AND Adrian SMITH Science and Technology Policy Research @ Sussex ‘9 “The (non-)politics of managing low carbon socio-technical Transitions” Environmental Politics 18 (5) p. 722-724
Political strategies for transitions In the reflexive spirit … programme for low carbon transitions.
The material and communal connection to energy engendered in the plan allows us to form emotional relationships with energy and remake the way we value it  Criticisms of this attachment ignore that we already have an unsustainable relationship to energy—only the aff’s move towards tangibility and awareness can “sustainably recode” society.

Pierce and Paulos, 2010 James Pierce, Eric Paulos, researcher and Cooper-Siegel Endowed Chair at the  Human-Computer Interaction Institute, Carnegie Mellon University “Materializing energy”, http://www.paulos.net/papers/2010/MaterializingEnergy_DIS2010.pdf

Designing for energy as material and … of our sustained  care and attention.
Energy must be rendered tangible via micro-generation.  Doing so builds a bridge between “energy awareness”—the status quo where people know about environmental consequences but don’t change their behavior—and “energy engagement”, where we actively remake our lives towards sustainability.  
Pierce and Paulos, 2010 James Pierce, Eric Paulos, researcher and Cooper-Siegel Endowed Chair at the  Human-Computer Interaction Institute, Carnegie Mellon University “Materializing energy”, http://www.paulos.net/papers/2010/MaterializingEnergy_DIS2010.pdf

Designing for energy engagement and attunement Energy …can design our world to be otherwise.

And, Government support is essential to the adoption of renewable tech—it LEADS to community and market acceptance. Complaints about “intermittency” aren’t failures of technology, they are failures of status quo political leadership.

Start your evaluation of the debate from an integrated, socio-technical perspective.  Politics, technology, economics, and society form a co-productive, interactive web.  Their arguments about “impossibility” or “technical failure” or “inevitability” take minor contingent facts and treat them as immutable—the plan is a change at every level that can radically alter our relationship to technology and the world

By laying out these impediments as “economic,” “…“marginalized” – cannot be answered prior to its adoption.

The plan creates a flexible approach to generation emphasizing local needs,  This institutional change challenges the central energy system by encouraging polycentric decision-making and empowering local actors
