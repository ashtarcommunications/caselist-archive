As conservation became a global enterprise in the 1970s and 1980s, the movement&amp;#39;s justification for saving nature shifted from spiritual and aesthetic values to focus on biodiversity. Nature was described as primeval, fragile, and at risk of collapse from too much human use and abuse. And indeed, there are consequences when humans convert landscapes for mining, logging, intensive agriculture, and urban development and when key species or ecosystems are lost.
But ecologists and conservationists have grossly overstated the fragility of nature, frequently arguing that

The fragility trope dates back, at least, to Rachel Carson, who wrote

Nonetheless, most have failed to take up the mantle of enforcement.

The first essential fact to be aware of is that most news stories about China’s

interest, but people do not trust that their findings will be protected.”
Similar concerns have, for the past two decades, grounded Beijing’s attempts to build a domestic airline industry, considered the pinnacle of high-tech manufacturing. Foreign companies and top-notch engineers have simply been unwilling to share technology with China (Boeing has even avoided building factories in China, for fear of commercial espionage). The result: Planes that fly from Beijing to Shanghai today are still built by Boeing and Airbus.
Of course, most green-energy equipment won’t match the complexity of assembling something like Boeing’s new Dreamliner, but the airplane situation sheds light on two points: that cheap labor is hardly the only factor driving business decisions, and that, despite substantial government support, China’s domestic aerospace engineers have not yet produced research to rival that of Western competitors.

Which begs the question: What if drillers and investors wait that long to move back into the natural gas fields in force?
Petroleum geologist Jeffrey Brown of Export Land Model fame offered a startling response in a conversation at a recent conference I attended. The production decline rates of the shale gas wells that are providing the bulk of new U.S. supplies are so high—60 percent in the first year and up to 85 percent by the end of the second year—that we may never be able to return to today’s production level.

As I reported in Saturday’s paper, New England is experiencing a remarkable spike in electricity prices brought on by high heating demand and rising natural gas prices for electric generators.

Wind advocates made a similar argument when the price of natural gas was high about five years ago: that even if wind energy was expensive, it could have a major impact on the price of gas by cutting demand slightly. In the commodity markets, small shortages or surpluses can result in huge price swings.

The U.S. economy, like other market economies, is more resilient than many people give it credit for. It can adjust to higher energy prices, just as it repeatedly has in the past. And, if history and economic theory are guides, sharp increases in the price of any resource usually are followed by long periods in which prices rise by less than average inflation.

Randall, 3/14/12 - Tom Randall is a deputy sustainability editor for Bloomberg News “Wind Innovations Drive Down Costs, Stock Prices”. Bloomberg. http://go.bloomberg.com/multimedia/wind-innovations-drive-down-costs-stock-prices/
The world’s wind-power capacity increased 113-fold over the past 20 years. As installations increase, turbines become more 
AND
&amp;#34;The cost of producing wind energy needs to come down to reach parity,&amp;#34; said Stefan Linder, an analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance. &amp;#34;However in the best locations onshore wind is already competitive with fossil fuel electricity, and most wind farms in fair resource areas will be at parity by 2016.&amp;#34;

Economic Crises?
Some scholars have argued that it is not poverty, as such, that contributes 
AND
of the conventional thinking about the political impact of economic crisis is wrong:
&amp;#34;The severity of economic crisis—as measured in terms of inflation and negative growth—bore no relationship to the collapse of regimes ... or (in democratic states, rarely) to an outbreak of violence... In the cases of dictatorships and semi-democracies, the ruling elites responded to crises by increasing repression (thereby using one form of violence to abort another).&amp;#34;

It is impossible to ignore the extent of America’s political disunity. In the current political climate, any show of bipartisanship, no matter how disingenuous, is praised. Recent immigration reform proposals are no exception.
The original plan, devised by a bipartisan group of senators, proposes an overhaul 
AND
Congress’ supposed bipartisanship is a smokescreen. In this period of dissent, the public clings to anything remotely positive. It’s a win-win situation: Both parties, in hedging a flimsy compromise, strengthen their constituencies. The president has already benefited; his approval rating is the highest it has been since 2009.

While overhauling the nation&amp;#39;s patchwork immigration laws is a top second term priority for the president, he has ceded

In an effort to keep Republicans at the negotiation table, Obama has stayed relatively quiet on immigration over the last month. He rolled out his immigration principles during a January rally in Las Vegas and made an impassioned call for overhauling the nation&amp;#39;s laws during his early February State of the Union address, then purposely handed off the effort to lawmakers.

The second-term honeymoon for President Obama is beginning to look like it is over.
Obama, who was riding high after his reelection win in November, has seen his poll numbers take a precipitous fall in 
AND
“He has the opportunity to take minor legislative victories and blow them up into major accomplishments – meaning if he got something on gun control, he can tout that that was part of his agenda and the work isn’t over. If he were able to strike a grand bargain with Republicans, that’d be a legacy issue.”
Still, Bonjean added, “It’s not looking so good right now.”
Gun vote first – Obama pushing
PBS NEWS 3 – 28 – 13 http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/2013/03/gay-marriage-cases-now-in-justices-hands.html

should tell Mr. Obama something about the Senate&amp;#39;s support for gun rights.
If Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., can&amp;#39;t round up the 60 votes needed to pass Democrats&amp;#39; legislation, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, may be ready with what one GOP aide called &amp;#34;a break-the-glass kit.&amp;#34; Grassley, the only Republican on the Judiciary Committee to support tougher penalties for straw purchases, is drafting an alternative gun control bill, presumably without the expanded background checks that he has opposed and which are central to the Democrats&amp;#39; bill.

WASHINGTON - The departure of Olympia Snowe and other like-minded moderates from the U.S. Senate next year could further elevate Republican Sen. Susan Collins as a swing vote despite a larger Democratic majority, say some political observers.
Collins, meanwhile, said she is optimistic that some of the new and returning senators will prove wrong the predictions of a &amp;#34;disappearing center.&amp;#34;

Among Republicans, Collins will be the ninth-highest member and the most senior Republican woman.
