4. Conclusion¶ To be able to be …of the most basic of human rights. 
PLAN:  The United States Federal Government should provide necessary financial incentives for community-planned solar and wind energy production.

Advantage 2 is empowered communities
Momentum exists for a fundamental change in our energy system.  Our policies need to stop supporting centralized elite, technocratic, corporate solutions and empower local community movements by encouraging smaller-scale generation and distribution of energy.  
An overt political challenge is a necessary component of this strategy.  The plan’s confrontation with status quo energy elites galvanizes movements and lends legitimacy to broader environmental movements.  
Scrase and Smith, 2009 Ivan SCRASE Science and Technology Policy Research @ Sussex AND Adrian SMITH Science and Technology Policy Research @ Sussex ‘9 “The (non-)politics of managing low carbon socio-technical
Transitions” Environmental Politics 18 (5) p. 722-724
Political strategies for transitions In … programme for low carbon transitions.

Energy must be rendered tangible via local generation.  Doing so builds a bridge between “energy awareness”—the status quo where people know about environmental consequences but don’t change their behavior—and “energy engagement”, where we actively remake our lives towards sustainability.  
This tangible engagement is the difference between shrilly shouting at people about energy and inviting and teaching them to change their lives.  The aff is the key to guiding our relationship with energy and society towards a sustainable future.  
Pierce and Paulos, 2010 James Pierce, Eric Paulos, researcher and Cooper-Siegel Endowed Chair at the¶ Human-Computer Interaction Institute, Carnegie Mellon University “Materializing energy”, http://www.paulos.net/papers/2010/MaterializingEnergy_DIS2010.pdf

Designing for energy engagement and …our world to be otherwise.

And, The plan’s incentive for local renewable microgeneration creates a material and emotional interaction with energy that challenges the monolithic energy structure of the status quo and fosters a broader discussion and participation in discussions about energy.  Awareness alone is insufficient—this sort of material engagement is a prerequisite to meaningful participation, and creates sustainable relationships to both the environment and society—we become aware of the ethical effects of our energy decisions

4.2. Transforming our … everyday interactions and practices toward sustainability.

The plan encourages a set of technologies that mediates our relationship with energy in such a way that it directs it towards sustainability—the psychological effects of its integration create wholesale cultural change and awareness—we think about the social aspects and not just the technology
Pierce and Paulos, 2010 James Pierce, Eric Paulos, researcher and Cooper-Siegel Endowed Chair at the¶ Human-Computer Interaction Institute, Carnegie Mellon University “Materializing energy”, http://www.paulos.net/papers/2010/MaterializingEnergy_DIS2010.pdf
Our approach is grounded in a belief that …. into those capable of being sustained. 5

The plan’s flexible approach to generation emphasized local needs, ownership and control.  This is an institutional change that challenges the central energy system by encouraging polycentric decision-making and empowering local actors at the expense of status quo energy elites—this can resolve issues like fuel poverty and differential distribution of environmental risk

6. Concluding remarks
What are the social foundations … developments. Ultimately the danger is that it will impede the application of the most promising solutions for smart grid development.

The plan’s focus on community-based solutions is essential for both broader adoption of technology and functional distributed generation schemes.  Allowing communities to come together around their local generation networks creates a shared sense of ownership—leading people to participate—and responsibility—leading to changes in consumption patterns.  Cookie cutter, imposed solutions are doomed to failure.

Burkett 11 - Professor of Law @ University of Hawaii Maxine Burkett,  “Climate Justice and the Elusive Climate Tort,” The Yale Law Journal Online, 121 Yale L.J. Online 115 (2011), pg. http://yalelawjournal.org/2011/09/13/burkett.html.

The Supreme Court’s decision in American Electric Power Co. v. Connecticut (AEP) …multi-layered commitment to rectifying, at least in part, the losses of the climate vulnerable.

Using damages to support domestic clean development supports indigenous sustainable energy.  This builds institutions dedicated to climate justice.

There are as many possibilities in rural communities.247 Native wind projects, for … and advanced with the support of an independent, firmly established market infrastructure—the dCDM. 

Clean development institutions establish a climate justice model for just transition.  
Without this model, green development leaves out the marginalized communities at the greatest risk from climate change.
Burkett 08 - Professor of law @ University of Colorado Maxine Burkett,  “Just Solutions to Climate Change: A Climate Justice Proposal for a Domestic Clean Development Mechanism,” Buffalo Law Review, 56 Buffalo L. Rev. 169, April 2008

Contention 2

Contention TWO: Adaptation
We need a legal model capable of promoting both climate mitigation and adaptation.  We must adapt our legal reasoning if we want to marshal the resources needed to cope.

Climate change is creating positive feedback loops that may irreversibly … we can marshal energy and resources into actions that will help humans, species, and ecosystems cope with the changes that are coming. Pg. 13-16
Compensation for climate adaptation is critical. Warming induced scarcity produces starvation and drought – billions of people will suffer.

Contention 3

Text: The United States federal judiciary should provide public nuisance compensation to climate justice claimants in the form of domestic clean development mechanism grants for wind power.

Contention Three: Climate Justice Praxis
Voting aff is a form of demosprudence – a legal bridge between aggrieved communities and existing institutions.  Becoming role-literate participants in legal debates builds public momentum for social change.

B. Litigation
Much of the litigation of the past few years focused on federal … creative solutions to the problems associated with GHG emissions.

Today, human conflicts have become less of a threat than the confrontation between Man and Nature. At least they are less likely to bring about the end of the human species. The reactions of Nature as a result of its exposure to the onslaughts of human societies have become more important in determining the fate of the human species than any harm it can inflict on itself.
Until recently, the threat Nature represented was perceived as likely to arise only in the long run, related for instance to how global warming would affect life on our planet. Such a threat could take decades, even centuries, to reach a critical level. This perception has changed following the devastating earthquake and tsunamis that hit the coastal regions of South Asia and, less violently, of East Africa, on 26 December.
This cataclysmic event has underscored the vulnerability of our world before the wrath of Nature 
AND
now forced to live with the possibility of an imminent demise of humankind.

II. OUR ENERGY USE AND ITS RESULTANT CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS
A. Overview
Greenhouse gases (GHGs) trap heat in the atmosphere.24 The primary GHG 
AND
as well as to the ecosystems upon which each depends for survival.28
In 1992, the U.S. signed and ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the stated objective of which was:
To achieve stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. Such a level should be achieved within a time-frame sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, to ensure that food production is not threatened and to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner.29
In 2007, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluded that it is “very likely”—at least 90% certain—that humans are responsible for most of the “unequivocal” increases in globally averaged temperatures of the previous fifty years.30
Yet in the twenty years since the UNFCCC, it also is unequivocal that GHG 
AND
began in 1750, and the largest percentage increase since 2003.”34
In order to even have a fifty-fifty chance that the average global temperature 
AND

What are some of the growing economic, public health, and environmental costs to 
AND
—a “hidden” number likely to be larger in the future.
What does the future hold for a carbon-stressed world? Most scientific analyses 
AND
the global average, and the warming in the Arctic greater still.”51
For example, the NRC expects that each degree Celsius increase will produce double to 
AND
while the Arctic Ocean ice cap disappears and Europe suffers greater droughts.56
To presently assess what a 5°C rise will mean, we must look 
AND
undertaking the major regulatory reforms I recommend in Part IV of this Article.
B. Specific Climate Threats and Consequences
1. When Weather Extremes Increase
A 2011 IPCC Special Report predicted that:
It is virtually certain 99–100% probability that increases in the 
AND
upward trends in extreme sea levels in extreme coastal high water levels.62
Similarly, a House of Representatives committee report (ACESA Report) found that “
AND
damages), and in October by Hurricane Sandy ($50 billion damages).66
The IPCC Synthesis identified impacts from growing weather hazards upon public health to include: 
AND
cities, with more than 150,000 additional deaths by 2100.70
Weather extremes also threaten our national security, which is premised on stability. In 2007, the CNA Corporation’s report National Security and the Threat of Climate Change described climate change as a “threat multiplier for instability” and warned that:
Projected climate change poses a serious threat to America’s national security. The predicted effects of climate change over the coming decades include extreme weather events, drought, flooding, sea level rise, retreating glaciers, habitat shifts, and the increased spread of life-threatening diseases. These conditions have the potential to disrupt our way of life and to force changes in the way we keep ourselves safe and secure.71
The following year, in the first ever U.S. government analysis of climate change security threats, the National Intelligence Council issued an assessment warning, in part, that climate change could threaten U.S. security by leading to political instability, mass movements of refugees, terrorism, and conflicts over water and other resources.72
2. When Frozen Water Melts
In 2007, the IPCC predicted that sea levels would rise by eight to twenty-four inches above current levels by 2100;73 since then, however, numerous scientists and studies have suggested that the 2007 prediction is already out-of-date and that sea levels will likely rise up to 1.4 meters (m), or 55 inches, given upwardly trending CO2 emissions.74 The 2009 ACESA Report found that rising sea levels are:
Already causing inundation of low-lying lands, corrosion of wetlands and beaches, exacerbation of storm surges and flooding, and increases in the salinity of coastal estuaries and aquifers. . . . Further, about one billion people live in areas within 75 feet elevation of today’s sea level, including many US cities on the East Coast and Gulf of Mexico, almost all of Bangladesh, and areas occupied by more than 250 million people in China.75
This year NASA’s Chief Scientist testified to Congress that two-thirds of sea level rise from the last three decades is derived from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets and the melting Arctic region; he then warned:
The West Antarctic ice sheet (WAIS), an area about the 
AND
exhibits great potential for substantial and relatively rapid contributions to sea level rise.
In Greenland, the situation is not as dramatic, since the bed that underlies most of the ice is not below sea level, and the potential for unabated retreat is limited to a few outlet glaciers. In Greenland, however, summer air temperatures are warmer and closer to ice’s melting point, and we have observed widespread accumulation of meltwater in melt ponds on the ice sheet surface.76
In the West Antarctic ice sheet region, glacier retreat appears to be widespread, as the air has “warmed by nearly 6°F since 1950.”77 As for Greenland’s ice sheet, it also is at greater risk than the IPCC had thought.
Recent studies with more complete modeling suggest that the warming threshold leading to an essentially ice-free state is not the previous estimate of an additional 3.1°C, but only 1.6°C. Thus, the 2°C target may be insufficient to prevent loss of much of the ice sheet and resultant significant sea level rise.78
The ACESA Report also identified the Arctic as “one of the hotspots of global 
AND
-free in the late summer beginning sometime between 2020 and 2037.82
How is the Arctic’s plight linked to non-Arctic impacts? “The Arctic region arguably has the greatest concentration of potential tipping elements in the Earth system, including Arctic sea ice, the Greenland ice sheet, North Atlantic deep-water formation regions, boreal forests, permafrost and marine methane hydrates.”83 Additionally:
Warming of the Arctic region is proceeding at three times the global average . . . . Loss of Arctic sea ice has been tentatively linked to extreme cold winters in Europe . . . . Near complete loss of the summer sea ice, as forecast for the middle of this century, if not before, will probably have knock-on effects for the northern mid-latitudes, shifting the jet streams and storm tracks.84 
Since 1980, sea levels have been rising three to four times faster than the global average between Cape Hatteras, North Carolina and Boston, Massachusetts.85 “Past and future global warming more than doubles the estimated odds of ‘century’ or worse floods occurring within the next 18 years” for most coastal U.S. locations.86

Although land-based glacier melts are not major contributors to sea level rise, 
AND
and western North America and Scandinavia by 2020 and globally by 2080.89
Climate change thus increases food insecurity by reducing yields of grains, such as corn and wheat, through increased water scarcity and intensification of severe hot conditions, thereby causing corn price volatility to sharply increase.90 Globally, the number of people living in “severely stressed” river basins will increase “by one to two billion people in the 2050s. About two-thirds of global land area is expected to experience increased water stress.”91
3. When Liquid Water Warms
Over the past century, oceans, which cover 70% of the Earth’s surface
AND
—species that are also are being harmed by the oceans’ warming.100
Extinctions from climate change also are expected to be significant and widespread. The IPCC 
AND
100 times faster than the rate at which many species can adapt.105
4. When Land Dries Out
The warming trends toward the Earth’s poles and higher latitudes are threatening people not just 
AND
emissions, we cannot trap or prevent permafrost carbon emissions at the source.
Similarly, forests, which “cover about 30% of the Earth’s land surface 
AND
recently suffered two ‘once a century’ droughts just five years apart.”115
Climate change also is exacerbating the geographic spread and intensity of insect infestations. For example:
In British Columbia . . . the mountain pine beetle extended its range north and has destroyed an area of soft-wood forest three times the size of Maryland, killing 411 million cubic feet of trees—double the annual take by all the loggers in Canada. Alaska has also lost up to three million acres of old growth forest to the pine beetle.116
Over the past fifteen years the spruce bark beetle extended its range into Alaska, where it has killed about 40 million trees more “than any other insect in North America’s recorded history.”117 The drying and burning forests, and other increasingly dry landscapes, also are causing “flora and fauna to move to higher latitudes or to higher altitudes in the mountains.”118
The human and environmental costs from failing to promptly reduce dependence on carbon-dioxide 
AND
fossil fueled GHGs near major American and global population centers is offshore wind.

The US doesn’t matter
Carpenter, 13—a senior fellow at the Cato Institute and a contributing editor to The National Interest, is the author of nine books on international affairs, including Smart Power: Toward a Prudent Foreign Policy for America (Ted, “Delusions of Indispensability,”March 1, 2013, http://server1.nationalinterest.org/article/delusions-indispensability-8145)

THE NOTION that the United States is the indispensable nation is a conceit bordering on 
AND
than clinging to a slipping hegemony until it is forced to give way.

Hegemony doesn’t prevent war – its absence would have zero effect on international stability 
Friedman 10 Ben, research fellow in defense and homeland security, Cato. PhD candidate in political science, MIT, Military Restraint and Defense Savings, 20 July 2010, http://www.cato.org/testimony/ct-bf-07202010.html

Another argument for high military spending is that U.S. military hegemony underlies global stability. Our forces and alliance commitments dampen conflict between potential rivals like China and Japan, we are told, preventing them from fighting wars that would disrupt trade and cost us more than the military spending that would have prevented war. The theoretical and empirical foundation for this claim is weak. It overestimates both the American military&amp;#39;s contribution to international stability and the danger that instability abroad poses to Americans. In Western Europe, U.S. forces now contribute little to peace, at best making the tiny odds of war among states there slightly more so.7 Even in Asia, where there is more tension, the history of international relations suggests that without U.S. military deployments potential rivals, especially those separated by sea like Japan and China, will generally achieve a stable balance of power rather than fight. In other cases, as with our bases in Saudi Arabia between the Iraq wars, U.S. forces probably create more unrest than they prevent. Our force deployments can also generate instability by prompting states to develop nuclear weapons. Even when wars occur, their economic impact is likely to be limited here.8 By linking markets, globalization provides supply alternatives for the goods we consume, including oil. If political upheaval disrupts supply in one location, suppliers elsewhere will take our orders. Prices may increase, but markets adjust. That makes American consumers less dependent on any particular supply source, undermining the claim that we need to use force to prevent unrest in supplier nations or secure trade routes.9 Part of the confusion about the value of hegemony comes from misunderstanding the Cold War. People tend to assume, falsely, that our activist foreign policy, with troops forward supporting allies, not only caused the Soviet Union&amp;#39;s collapse but is obviously a good thing even without such a rival. Forgotten is the sensible notion that alliances are a necessary evil occasionally tolerated to balance a particularly threatening enemy. The main justification for creating our Cold War alliances was the fear that Communist nations could conquer or capture by insurrection the industrial centers in Western Europe and Japan and then harness enough of that wealth to threaten us — either directly or by forcing us to become a garrison state at ruinous cost. We kept troops in South Korea after 1953 for fear that the North would otherwise overrun it. But these alliances outlasted the conditions that caused them. During the Cold War, Japan, Western Europe and South Korea grew wealthy enough to defend themselves. We should let them. These alliances heighten our force requirements and threaten to drag us into wars, while providing no obvious benefit.

A number of polls released this month have shown that President Barack Obama’s approval rating 
AND
is crucial to understanding how Republicans will fare in negotiations with the president. 
A CNN/ORC poll, taken between March 15 – 17, 2013, 
AND
, survey which found Obama’s job approval rating at 47/51 percent.
The president’s approval rating is even more troubling for his supporters when one digs into this poll’s crosstabs. Obama is underwater among women. 49 percent of women disapproving of the job he has done in office compared to 48 percent who approve. Though this result is well within this subsample’s +/- 4.5 percent margin of error, in September of 2012, 51 to 45 percent of women approved of the job Obama is doing in office.
The president is buoyed by young adults aged 18 – 35-years-old 
AND
unpopular among self-identified independents as he was prior to the election.
In fact, the only area where the president has shown an irrefutable increase in his level of support is among those adults residing in the Northeast. Today, 60 percent of adults in the Northeast approve of the job Obama is doing in office compared to 36 who disapprove. In September, just 50 percent of Northeasterners approved of Obama compared to 46 percent who disapproved.
CNN/ORC’s findings are matched by other pollsters in the field in a similar period. A McClatchy/Marist poll from March 4 – 7, 2013 of 1,068 registered voters found Obama slipping to 45 percent approval and 48 percent disapproval. A Democracy Corps survey of likely voters taken from March 9 – 12, 2013, shows Obama down to 48 percent approval and 49 percent disapproval. Neither poll, however, provides their full crosstabs.
One survey that does, however, provide a counter to these findings is a recent Washington Post/ABC News poll of an undisclosed number of adults taken from March 7 – 10. This survey found Obama above water at 50 to 46 percent approval. However, they registered a significant dip from Obama’s job approval rating in a WaPo/ABC poll released January 13 which showed the president at 55/41 percent approval.
What these polls show definitively is that the president’s post-election bounce is gone
AND
not a place a president entering his second term would prefer to be.

1. Conditionality is a voting issue—it encourages argument under-development and hurts the 2AC by making it impossible to anticipate the negative strategy—and kills education by ignoring argument interaction. If they get multiple worlds we should get to advocate the permutation. Dispo solves your offense 

2. Permutation—do both—shields the link to the net benefit or solves the net benefit

3. Perm: do the counterplan—it does the aff but changes implied functions of fiat. Counterplans must be textually AND functionally competitive. Resolved means the topic committee voted for it and should means desirable. That’s dictionary.com

Permutation do the counterplan then the plan 

Permutation do the plan then the counterplan 

Democracy links to the supreme court plank because they are not elected either.

Democracy doesn’t solve war ~-~-- it’s multilateral institutions and historical patterns

4. States Fiat is a voting issue—Illegit against this aff – the restrictions are the state restrictions – makes it the object of the resolution.  That form of fiat kills all aff ground.

5. Perm do the counterplan – states action moots the aff.  Avoids the link to all the disads because the perm includes a plan that does absolutely nothing

6. Perm allows blame shifting to the states
