We call our argument The Chinese Finger Trap.

There is no outside of power, oppression or the resolution. The aff~’s attempt at rejection of ________________ puts on blindfolds while traversing a minefield. The aff~’s theoretical clean conscience inevitably creates a return of the repressed  — __________________ will return over and over to blow up in the aff~’s face when it least expects it.
Derrida 95
(The Gift of Death p. 25-7)
On two or three occasions Patocka denounces the persistence of a type of Platonism—
AND
also goes, for the same reasons, for freedom and for decision.

Will-to-science – The aff~’s discourse of standpoint and social location requires a will to science that replicates the violence of abstract positivism. The aff believes to understand someone~’s experience, you simply have to ask them when the truth is they don~’t and can~’t know who or what they are. Actual experience becomes the golden ticket to political legitimacy drawing circles of political exclusion while foreclosing the question of the ideological and textual basis of the experience of life.
Patricia T. Clough, Fordham Univeristy. The Sociological Quarterly, Vol. 34, No. 1 (Spring, 1993), pp. 169-182
Thus, while Smith has gone a long way in reading out the ordinary features

can the social scientist know the difference between actual activities and ideological practices.

Purity and identity end the possibility of the political.

War is a further experience of the gift of death ~~la mort donnée
AND
unconsciousness, something PatoEcka will later call &amp;#34;orgiastic irresponsibility&amp;#34; (112).

The logic of a pure rejection is secretly reliant on Platonism and western metaphysics, where mystery and hesitation can be completely consumed by untainted certainty – the theoretical embodiment of totalitarianism.

It~’s impossible to present a new origin – historicity is inescapable and reemerges in the aff~’s attempt to theorize history.

the mysterium tremendum the ontological content that Heidegger attempts to remove from it.

The question of this debate is not what the 1ac should have done. Instead we should ask what the affirmative foreclosed.
By relating to the resolution and ___________ in terms of purity and identity, the aff renders invisible other readings of the resolution and their terms, other identities of the text. This turns the case – the aff burns the roads leading away from the harms they identify.
Derrida 64
(Jacques, Violence and Metaphysics)
That philosophy died yesterday, since Hegel or Marx, Nietzsche; or Heidegger—
AND
and huddle lazily in the depths of childhood, but precisely the opposite.


Other readings of texts are necessarily always possible because of how language functions – every linguistic organization must be able to be ripped from its context while remaining intelligible or else language would not exist or function communicatively across context.
Derrida 72
(Signature, Event, Context)
In effect, what are the essential predicates in a minimal determination of the classical concept of writing?
AND
is no experience of pure presence, but only chains of differential marks.

There is nothing abstract about the violence of standpoint epistemology – it makes the identification of race traitors and inauthentic persons possible and ensures their violent exodus from the political. The moving goalpost of authentic experience makes violence structurally endless.

The aff~’s naievete is proven by the organization and language of the 1ac.
