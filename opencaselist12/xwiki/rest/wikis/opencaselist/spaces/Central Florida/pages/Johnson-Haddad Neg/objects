Alternative Text: the judge should vote negative to refuse the economics of speed Prior refusal of the economics of speed is key- fractures its hegemony and opens space for a multitude of economic timescapes- only this re-framing can lead to effective capitalism Hassan ‘5 (ARC Senior Research Fellow, Media and Communications @ Univ. of Melbourne) (Robert, Timescapes of the Network Society, Fast Capitalism 1.1, http:~/~/www.uta.edu/huma/agger/fastcapitalism-/1_1/hassan.html) Nonetheless, the truly revolutionary AND haven&amp;#39;t yet dreamed of.

It seems obvious that &#xD;

&#xD;
SECOND, THE REDUCTION OF CLASS TO A NEUTRAL LEVEL AMONG A LONG LIST OF OTHER OPPRESSIONS SUCH AS RACISM DESTROYS THE EMANCIPATORY POTENTIAL OF CLASS TO REACH ACROSS ALL LINES OF INDENTITY AND FORGE POLITICAL ACTION.  CLASS MUST BE RECOGNIZED AS QUALITATIVELY MORE IMPORTANT—OTHERWISE THE SYSTEM IS ABLE TO SATISFY DEMANDS ON GROUNDS OF FORMAL EQUALITY, DESTROYING ATTEMPTS TO OVERCOME CAPITALIST OPPRESSION***&#xD;

There are many competing &#xD;
AND&#xD;
&amp;#34;intersectionality&amp;#34; is class power.&#xD;
&#xD;
BECAUSE RACISM IS DIALECTICALLY CONJOINED WITH THE EXPLOITATIVE LOGIC OF CAPITALISM, ONLY THE TOTALIZING METHOD OF CLASS POLITICS CAN OFFER THE WAY OUT—Narratives will be coopted and used by capitalism to further exploit oppressed groups.&#xD;

Vote Negative to validate and adopt the method of structural/historical criticism that is the 1NC.&#xD;
THIS IS NOT THE ALTERNATIVE, BUT IN TRUTH THE ONLY OPTION— METHOD IS THE FOREMOST POLITICAL QUESTION BECAUSE ONE MUST UNDERSTAND THE EXISTING SOCIAL TOTALITY BEFORE ONE CAN ACT ON IT—GROUNDING THE SITES OF POLITICAL CONTESTATION OR KNOWLEDGE OUTSIDE OF LABOR AND SURPLUS VALUE MERELY SERVE TO HUMANIZE CAPITAL AND PREVENT A TRANSITION TO A SOCIETY BEYOND OPPRESSION&#xD;

Any effective political theory &#xD;
AND&#xD;
masquerades as social theory.&#xD;
&#xD;
RESISTANCE TO CAPITAL MUST BE A TOTAL NEGATION OF THE SYSTEM FROM OUT-SIDE OF GOVERNMENT—WHILE SOME INSIDE POLITICAL GAINS ARE POSSIBLE, THEY ARE TRUMPED BY THE ABILITY OF THE SYSTEM TO USE REFORMS TO RESTABILIZE CAPITAL AND MARGINALIZE LABOR AS A SOCIAL ALTERNATIVE&#xD;

SO MUCH FOR YOUR PERMUTATION—CAPITALISM IS AN INERTIAL SYSTEM—ANY VESITAGE LEFT REMAINING BY THE PERMUTATION WILL INEVITABLY SPIN BACK UP.  LIKE A MANY-HEADED HYDRA, IT WILL REGENERATE WITH EVERY ATTEMPT THAT ATTACKS THE INSTRUMENTS AS OPPOSSED TO THE SYSTEM ITSELF***&#xD;

METHODOLOGY IS THE FOREMOST POINT OF DEPARTURE TO ANY POLITICAL QUERY.  YOU SHOULD EVALUATE EPISTEMOLOGY FIRST BECAUSE THE WAY YOU THINK ABOUT PROBLEMS DETERMINES HOW YOU RESPOND TO THEM AND THE CONSEQUENCES THEY ENGENDER&#xD;
