Banning is the same as tech and science solves arguments: They criticize people who assume science and tech are the panacea for nuclear power ills while they assume that just getting rid of nuclear power will address the harms they isolate in their Net benefits. Both mindsets ignore the decisions and processes that make it possible to disadvantage particular populations and environments.

The extensive news coverage of the major problems the Fukushima reactors experienced after power was disrupted as a result of the massive tsunami that hit the Japanese coast on March 11, 2011, does not appear to have had a long-term effect on Americans~’ attitudes about nuclear power. Although attitudes may have shifted in the immediate aftermath of last year~’s incident, attitudes now are almost identical to those measured in last year~’s pre-disaster survey.

Spending spin is asinine- the counterplan would have to result in more spending in order to make up for the loss of energy- otherwise it~’d lead to rolling blackouts in places like Chicago that have a nuclear grid- either way the counterplan sparks political backlash

This cuts to the heart of a problem we have highlighted before – namely that

Nuclear power does not compete with oil – they show little overlap with market.

The Cold War was also a contest of raw power. With its gargantuan budget

spending and the testing of a new ICBM should not obscure these weaknesses.

No relationship between nuke and oil

Conventional notions of nuclear advocacy and opposition are joined in the their same sense of universality. Those who advocated the original creation of the atomic weapon found them to be a defense of universal truth… The universal truth of the atom would end war itself by creating a unified global gulture that would end the chaoos of difference &#xD;

Universalism is not particular to the architects of nuclear weapons. Jonathan Schell, the great advocate for banning nuclear weawpons, argues that nuclear weapons link us together because of their universal power and threat. He asserts a nuclear world is in danger of a chaotic extinction that can only be solved by a universal culture against nuclear weapons&#xD;

The creation of the nuclear, it&amp;#39;s employment, and its culture are not universal. The very origin of nuclear power is steeped in a divided cultural history that white persons have attmpted to efface. &#xD;
