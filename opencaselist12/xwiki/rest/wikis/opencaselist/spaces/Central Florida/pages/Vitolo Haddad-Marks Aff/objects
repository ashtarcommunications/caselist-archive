Graham ’98 (Mary, Brookings Institute, “Environmental Protection and the States: &amp;#34;&amp;#34;Race to the Bottom&amp;#34;&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;&amp;#34;Race to the Bottom Line&amp;#34;&amp;#34;?” Winter, http://www.brookings.edu/research/articles/1998/12/winter-environment-graham, TGA)

To call attention to these changes is not to deny that state and local governments

opportunities that affect farms and housing developments as well as forests and meadows.

That cheating allows injustice to take hold in siting decisions. Don’t view the solvency deficit debate in utilitarian terms – that framework has traditionally been used in policy making decisions to make decisions that render populations invisible.
