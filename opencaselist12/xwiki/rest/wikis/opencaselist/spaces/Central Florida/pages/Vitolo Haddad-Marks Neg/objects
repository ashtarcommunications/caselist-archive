Organizing the economy around innovation creates economics of speed- leads to rapid investment shifting and product development- that’s unsustainable and makes financial collapse inevitable
Goldman et al. ‘6

The formula for success is ....... of risk is omnipresent. 

Their requirement of new nuclear tech to be sped to market perpetuates the infinite growth cycle
Byrne et al 09
Relocating Energy in the Social........ prosperity to be enjoyed.

Service liberalization like the plan removes barriers to speed and increases the pace of global economic transaction- ensures environmental collapse, resource wars, and extinction

Paul Virilio’s metaphor of a .......... more painfully that speed kills.
 
Alternative Text: the judge should vote negative to refuse the economics of speed

Prior refusal of the economics of speed is key- fractures its hegemony and opens space for a multitude of economic timescapes- only this re-framing can lead to effective capitalism

THE AFFIRMATIVES FOCUS ON THE DISCURSIVE/SYMBOLIC REVEALS THE EXTENT TO WHICH THEY HAVE GIVEN UP ON ACTUALLY CHALLENGING THE STRUCTURES OF OPPRESSION.  BUT FAR FROM BEING A POST-CAPITALIST AGE IN WHICH ALL SOCIAL EXPERIENCE IS TEXTUALLY OR DISCURSIVELY PRODUCED, IT IS A MATERIAL WORLD.  ONLY A MATERIALIST METHOD CAN ACCOUNT FOR THE WAYS IN WHICH CERTAIN CLASSES CREATE AND DEPLOY RHETORIC TO LEGITIMIZE A CAPITALIST MODE OF SOCIAL RELATIONS

At the very least, ……………. producing transformative knowledges. (p. 7)



DIVORCING IDEOLOGICAL CRITIQUE FROM ITS RELATIONSHIP TO THE ANY ACTION OR STATIC DEFINITION COLLAPSES QUICKLY INTO NOTHING MORE THAN RELATIVISM—IF EVERYTHING IS CONSTRUCTED OR IDEOLOGICAL THAN THERE BECOMES NO BASIS ON WHICH TO JUDGE OR DISCREDIT THE HEGEMONIC FORMS OF CAPITALISM

Dana, Prof of Comm at UT Austin, “The Affirmative Masquerade”, p. online: http://www.acjournal.org/holdings/vol4/iss3/special/cloud.htm
It is difficult to ……….. and unity of a fascistic one.

FURTHER MORE, THE ABSENCE OF STRUCTURAL HISTORICISM IS NO MERE OVERSIGHT, NOR IS IT ENOUGH TO SIMPLY MENTION ECONOMICS IN A FEW OF YOUR CARDS~-~- THE RELIANCE ON FLUIDITY IS NOT AN ACCIDENTAL INSTANCE OF IGNORING CLASS.  THE DEMAND ARISES OUT OF THE CRISIS OF LIBERALISM—SUCH POLITICS PARTICULARIZES THE OPPRESSIONS OF CAPITALISM TO THE POINT THAT THE UNIVERSAL SYSTEM IS NATURALIZED.  ATTAINING WHITE, MALE BOURGEOISSE PRIVILEGE BECOMES THE BENCH-MARK OF POLITICAL SUCCESS, RE-ENTRENCHING THE VERY FOUNDATION OF THE SYSTEM

BROWN 93
Wendy, Professor and Genius, “Wounded Attachments”, Political Theory, Aug
Although this détente……..explicitly politicized marking.

NEXT, THE REDUCTION OF CLASS TO A NEUTRAL LEVEL AMONG A LONG LIST OF OTHER OPPRESSIONS SUCH AS RACE AND GENDER, DESTROYS THE EMANCIPATORY POTENTIAL OF CLASS TO REACH ACROSS ALL LINES OF INDENTITY AND FORGE POLITICAL ACTION.  CLASS MUST BE RECOGNIZED AS QUALITATIVELY MORE IMPORTANT—OTHERWISE THE SYSTEM IS ABLE TO SATISFY DEMANDS ON GROUNDS OF FORMAL EQUALITY, DESTROYING ATTEMPTS TO OVERCOME CAPITALIST OPPRESSION***

There are many ……….. &amp;#34;intersectionality&amp;#34; is class power.

Observation Two: Moving on up?

FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF STRUCTURAL KRITIK, THERE CAN BE NO SUCH THING AS ‘MAKING THINGS BETTER’— THEIR MODEL OF POLITICS, NO MATTER HOW SUBVERSIVE OR CONSERVATIVE, ALL FUNDAMENTALLY EXAGERATE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE FORMAL INSTITUTION OF POLITICS AND POWER, IGNORING THE WAYS SUCH A SYSTEM CREATES KNOWLEDGE—ONLY A MARXIST SHIFT TO KRITIK THE STRUCTURE AND CREATE MASS SOCIAL CONSCIOUSNESS WILL OVERCOME THIS FAILURE OF POLITICS

To think about the …………. something that has to be built.

NEXT, THE DETERMINISM OF CAPITAL IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INSTRUMENTALIZATION OF ALL LIFE—IT IS THIS LOGIC THAT MOBILIZES AND ALLOWS FOR THE 1AC’S SCENARIOS IN THE FIRST PLACE 

dyer-witherford 99
Nick, Prof at U. of Western Ontario, Cyber Marx: Cycles and Circuits of Struggle in High Technology Capitalism 
For capitalism, ……….. backfired is all too obvious.

FINALLY, THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS AN ETHICAL ACTION THAT STANDS OUTSIDE OF POLITICS—YOUR ETHICAL DEMAND TO COME PRIOR TO THE STRUCTURAL NEGATION OF CAPITAL IS THE LARGEST VIOLATION OF ETHICS

Meszaros 95
Istavan, Prof. Emeritus at Sussex, Beyond Capital: Towards a Theory of Transitionp. 409-10
Politics and morality ……….lessons of the recent past.


Vote Negative to validate and adopt the method of structural/historical criticism that is the 1NC.

THIS IS NOT THE ALTERNATIVE, BUT IN TRUTH THE ONLY OPTION— METHOD IS THE FOREMOST POLITICAL QUESTION BECAUSE ONE MUST UNDERSTAND THE EXISTING SOCIAL TOTALITY BEFORE ONE CAN ACT ON IT—GROUNDING THE SITES OF POLITICAL CONTESTATION ON KNOWLEDGE OUTSIDE OF LABOR AND SURPLUS VALUE MERELY SERVE TO HUMANIZE CAPITAL AND PREVENT A TRANSITION TO A SOCIETY BEYOND OPPRESSION

tumino 2001
Stephen, Prof English at Pitt, ““What is Orthodox Marxism and Why it Matters Now More than Ever”, Red Critique, p. online
Any effective political theory ………..that masquerades as social theory.


TEXTUALITY ASSUMES THAT THERE IS NO PRODUCTIVE FORCE THAT IS EXTRA-DISCURSIVE—THIS DESTROYS UNDERSTANDING OF THE WAYS THAT THE BASE MANIPULATES AND DEPLOYS THOSE DISCOURSES. A MATERIALIST FOCUS ON HISTORY AND STRUCTURE IS CRITICAL TO AVOID A COLLAPSE INTO RELATIVISM AND TO ORIENT ANTI-CAPTIALIST STRUGGLES

While Greene also ………exploited and oppressed.

AND NEXT, RESISTANCE TO CAPITAL MUST BE A TOTAL NEGATION OF THE SYSTEM FROM OUT-SIDE OF GOVERNMENT—WHILE SOME INSIDE POLITICAL GAINS ARE POSSIBLE, THEY ARE TRUMPED BY THE ABILITY OF THE SYSTEM TO USE REFORMS TO RESTABILIZE CAPITAL AND MARGINALIZE LABOR AS A SOCIAL ALTERNATIVE

Meszaros 95
Istavan, Prof. Emeritus at Sussex, Beyond Capital: Towards a Theory of Transitionp. 738
Thus the role of ………..parliamentary power of capital.


AND SO MUCH FOR YOUR PERMUTATION—CAPITALISM IS AN INERTIAL SYSTEM—ANY VESITAGE LEFT REMAINING BY THE PERMUTATION WILL INEVITABLY SPIN BACK UP.  LIKE A MANY-HEADED HYDRA, IT WILL REGENERATE WITH EVERY ATTEMPT THAT ATTACKS THE INSTRUMENTS AS OPPOSSED TO THE SYSTEM ITSELF***

FINALLY, METHODOLOGY IS THE FOREMOST POINT OF DEPARTURE TO ANY POLITICAL QUERY.  YOU SHOULD EVALUATE EPISTEMOLOGY FIRST BECAUSE THE WAY YOU THINK ABOUT PROBLEMS DETERMINES HOW YOU RESPOND TO THEM AND THE CONSEQUENCES THEY ENGENDER
