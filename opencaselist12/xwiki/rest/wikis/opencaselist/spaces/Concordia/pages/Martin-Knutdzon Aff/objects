====Western thought also relies on the dualism between nature and human. This dualism is hierarchal and anthropocentric, devaluing everything that is non-human. ====&#xD;
**Hoetzer 10** ~~[Irene: law lecturer at the Sydney International Campus of Central Queensland University. Irene is currently completing a PhD in environmental law at Macquarie University.  &amp;#34;Ecofeminism and Environmental Justice&amp;#34; http://www.inter-disciplinary.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/hoetzerpaper.pdf p. 4~~]&#xD;
One explanation of why a society does not feel morally compelled to¶ protect nature can be attributed to its underlying belief system. In the Western world, this is largely shaped by Christian ideals and traditions,¶ according to which nature is viewed to exist for human use, thus as something to be exploited for its materials and resources and sources of knowledge, which in turn lead to power and control.15 Also under this belief¶ system, ~~[hu~~]mankind is created in the image of a God, who is omnipotent,¶ omniscient but also benevolent. Whilst the concepts of omnipotence and¶ omniscience are clearly evident in the desire for power and control, the¶ aspect of benevolence is however clearly overlooked, perhaps because¶ utilitarian objectives intuitively do not take the interests of others into¶ account. Thus, the moral standing of the West is to value others only in terms of its own interests, so all judgments are made in terms of Western perceptions, values and experiences. Furthermore, Western thought also organises things into hierarchical dichotomies according to which the world is to be interpreted and interactions with it dictated. As it is believed that¶ humans are created in the image of God, humans are considered to be the most important entity on earth and to have been granted greater powers than others, as evidenced in the power of reason.¶ This anthropocentric view of the world, which distinguishes between instrumental and intrinsic values, fails to acknowledge the intrinsic value of anything that is not human.16 Environmental ethicists challenge this view and¶ claim that all of nature has its own, separate intrinsic value. Ecofeminists also¶ hold this view but further argue that the culture over nature dichotomy that dominates Western thought is representative of the dominance/subordinance hierarchy that permeates the fabric of patriarchal capitalist society and results in women and nature sharing a common inferior position. For ecofeminists,¶ therefore, the ecological crisis is more than a question of environmental destruction and human misery. By drawing attention to the interconnection of¶ women and nature, ecofeminists argue that egalitarian, non-hierarchical¶ structures must be created, in which the inherent value of nature is¶ acknowledged and the relationships between humans, non-humans and the¶ natural environment become just and sustainable.17&#xD;
&#xD;
Western culture and modernity continue to subjectify and destroy other cultures based upon its anthropocentric posturing toward the world / a reorientation of metaphysics and epistemology is critical&#xD;

Our advocacy is: to affirm a rethinking of our ontological relationship with Nature. We seek to adopt a relational ontology that has radical openness to fields of flesh====&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
====Our advocacy seeks to analyze our ontological assumptions about the world by adopting a relational ethos that is dynamic and open-ended. This allows us to rethink the way we conceive our relationship with Nature.====&#xD;

**====flesh is the fabric of our relationship to the world around us. It is this connection that allows us to question our ontological relationships in the world by recognizing that ~’my body is made out of the same flesh as the world.~’====**&#xD;
Bryan E.** Bannon 2011** (Flesh and Nature: Understanding Merleau-Ponty~’s Relational Ontology, Research in Phenomenology 41 (2011) 327-357, Wesleyan University) &#xD;
Having explored the notion of the flesh of things, we are now prepared to &#xD;
AND&#xD;

====The affirmative isn~’t to dream of a world in which humanity never interfered with nature or created a pristine nature, rather, we must reorient ourselves towards a world in which human has an environmental ethic which recognizes the interconnectivity among all beings====&#xD;

====Aesthetics go beyond the bound of our sensory perception—it is all bound in our metaphysical understanding of &amp;#34;environment as experience&amp;#34;====&#xD;

So how might this notion of flesh transform our thinking about environmental¶ questions? &#xD;
AND&#xD;
this that Merleau-Ponty~’s concept of ~’flesh~’ helps us to do.&#xD;

====Only a new understanding of the lowercase flesh allows for this experiential environmentality. ====&#xD;

If, however, flesh is not properly a kind of thing or being, &#xD;
AND&#xD;
be the case that being itself is determined by and through human experience.</headline></objectSummary></objects>
