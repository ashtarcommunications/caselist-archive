**~1.       **__Mutually Exclusive__ – The CP excludes all non-airborne turbines from qualifying for the incentive. Any permutation would be severance of Affirmative advocacy and prove the abuse on the ‘Resolved’ topicality.

 

**2.       **__Theoretical Competition__ – Affirmative advocacy is to support energy produced from multiple sources, while the CP specifies their technology. If they had wanted to advocate a single technology, they should have specified in plan text.

==== **Our alternative is to embrace //gelassenheit//. 
\\The first step is “Releasement towards things” – this will allow us to become aware that technology is useful, but shackles us. Awareness can break the shackles, denying technology the right to dominate our existence. 
\\The second step is “openness to the mystery.”  This is a “higher action” that means we do not demand answers – we wait. This is how we transform our thinking from calculative to meditative. We have to wait to allow Being to reveal itself to us.  [emphasize that there needs to be a will to not will]** ====
