The current orientation puts excess energy to work; it maximizes its use-value for utilities sake. This justifies the destruction of the globe through the overabundance of apocalyptic technology. We should affirm excess gloriously; we should affirm the production of beauty through sacrifice. ====

Bataille does, then, implicitly face the …., the world~’s (but not modernity~’s) survival.


====We need a rush of explosive joy – this disrupts the ways action becomes dependent on the figure of a god. ====
Bataille 1994 ( Georges, writer, pornographer, and philosopher from France. &amp;#34;On Nietzsche&amp;#34; Found in part: June /July 1944 chapter 5)

FOR THE time being, like a fish out of water. …., transcendence is imperative by choice. 


====Critical thought is not only the execution of a task or judgment based on rational criteria.  Critical thought is the unconcealing of the irrational will to over-administration.  Art then becomes a vehicle through which we can achieve authentic autonomy by creating the distance necessary to challenge the industrial cultural practices of the status quo.  ====
Papastephanou in 06 (Marianna.The Journal of Aesthetic Education, Volume 40, Number 3, Fall 2006, pp. 75-91 (Article). &amp;#34;Aesthetics, Education, the Critical Autonomous Self, and the Culture Industry&amp;#34;)

If art is—amongst other things—&amp;#34;a means of ~’… domains of our relation to reality.  


====Education has succumbed to the cultural industry.  It is only capable of appeasement and mass indoctrination.  The experience of oppositional art, not the art of the cultural assembly line offers us with a chance to reconceptualize autonomy and freedom in such a way that we are capable of authentic education.  ====

How are art, its education, and its … significantly the latter~’s objectives. 


====The act of sacrifice pulls things out of their servility – restoring them to the sacred. In Aztec society sacrifice provided a substitution to the spread of violence. ====
Richard Lee Jr. Politics and the Thing. Found in Reading Bataille Now 246-247

Aztec society is organized … but is a consumption without return.

Zeynep Direk (2007) Found in Erotic Experience and Sexual Difference in Bataille From the book Reading Bataille Now edited by Winnubrst on page 96-97

At the foundation of general economy seems to lie …. illusion of the coincidence of the subject with itself. 


====Baudrillard destroys the ambiguity of the accursed share - He places the accursed share into metaphysics and destroys it~’s potential. ====
Benjamin Noys 2000 , lecturer in English at University College Chichester , &amp;#34;Georges Bataille : A Critical Introduction&amp;#34; P121-122 

Baudrillard no longer needs to …. every system (including¶ those which reject it).



Bataille in 1936 (Georges, The Sacred Conspiracy)

What we are undertaking is a war. … in which I find myself being he, that is, a monster.

 “Van Gogh began to give to the sun a meaning which it had not yet had.  He did not introduce it into his canvases as part of a décor, but rather like the sorcerer whose dance slowly rouses the crowd, transporting it in its movement.  At that moment all of his painting finally became radiation, explosion, flame, and himself, lost in ecstasy before a source of radiant life, exploding, inflamed.” &#xD;
[Bataille &amp;#38; Michelson 86 [Georges &amp;#38; Annette (Prof of Cinema Studies), “Van Gogh as Prometheus,” October 36, 58-60, http://www.jstor.org/stable/778550]&#xD;
Van Gogh’s solar radiation invites a different approach to this year’s resolution.  Debates have been constrained by a limited understanding of the world that ignores that there are two suns. One view elevates the sun to be the ultimate source of truth and energy. The second sun, rotten with glory and waste is eclipsed by the drive to make the world useful.  Van Gogh’s act of auto-mutilation is a production of an other solar energy, energy other to the economy of productivity and utility.  &#xD;
&#xD;
Jay 94 [Martin, Prof of History at UC Berkeley, “The Disenchantment of the Eye,” ed. Lucien Taylor, Visualizing Theory: Selected Essays from V.A.R. 1990-1994, p.178-9]&#xD;
No less subversive of traditional &#xD;
AND&#xD;
conflicting meanings for Bataille.  &#xD;
&#xD;
Van Gogh’s sacrifice occurred along a solar trajectory as apart of the general economy – he lived like a sun. It was a production of solar energy through waste and ecstasy. The sun serves as the basis for life and, in turn, the ability to expend energy.  Life is an effect of the sun squandering upon us without return: a unilateral, excessive, and wasteful burning. &#xD;
&#xD;
Land 92 [Nick, Lecturer in Continental Philosophy at Warwick, The Thirst for Annihilation, p. 22-23]&#xD;
&#xD;
All human endeavour &#xD;
AND&#xD;
excess must, in the end, be spent.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
The affirmation of solar expenditure challenges the modern economy built on the destruction of nature for the production of comfort. A traditional interpretation of the resolution would ask us to build more solar panels or power the gird. This stockpiling of resources is inseparable from a modern subjectivity that desires stability and wholeness. The depersonalization of the experience of consumption renders intimate expenditure impossible.  &#xD;
&#xD;
Stoekl 07 [Allan, Prof of Comp Lit at Penn State, Bataille’s Peak: Energy, Religion, and Postsustainability, p.138-140]&#xD;
&#xD;
Thus Bataille’s affirmation &#xD;
AND&#xD;
remain in thrall to the self as ultimate signified.&#xD;
&#xD;
Energy derived from fossil fuels is profoundly different from the energy affirmed by the affirmative. Solar energy pulses through the body, causing anguish and intimacy. For it is the lack of intimacy that contributes to the stockpiling of the standing reserve and the indifferent depletion of energy. Modern warfare reflects this lack of intimacy – war reduced to a calculation of use value &#xD;
&#xD;
Stoekl 07 [Allan, Prof of Comp Lit at Penn State, Bataille’s Peak: Energy, Religion, and Postsustainability, p. 56-7]&#xD;
Just as there are two energetic &#xD;
AND&#xD;
and through death, have disappeared.&#xD;
&#xD;
Just as the sun is doubled, so too is the figure of the United States federal government.  The flesh of the condemned marks the inverted double of the sovereign power of the state.  Our flesh is the beautiful and rotten excess produced through the relentless drive for production, but it therefore also marks the point at which sovereignty can be reappropriated.  &#xD;
We, the flesh of the United States federal government, are capable of reasserting the excessive enjoyment of life through sacrifice.  We, the flesh of the United States federal government, should gloriously sacrifice our flesh to live like suns.&#xD;
&#xD;
Hansen &amp;#38; Stepputat 05 [Thomas (Prof of Anthropology) &amp;#38; Finn (Senior Researcher at the Danish Institute for International Studies), Sovereign Bodies: Citizens, Migrants, and States in the Postcolonial World, http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/i7996.html]&#xD;
It was Foucault&amp;#39;s Discipline and Punish: &#xD;
AND&#xD;
extraordinary actions and moments. &#xD;
&#xD;
The destruction of otherness is the aftereffect of sovereignty connected to absolutism. We must destroy these ‘Gods’ of understandings of the world through the sacrifice of our flesh. This anguish causes fleeting moments of communication between us. &#xD;
Jeremy Biles 24 Nov 2011 PhD from the University of Chicago Divinity School “The Remains of God: Batailie/ Sacrifice/ Community” Found in Culture, Theory and Critique 52:2-3 on 141&#xD;
It is true that Bataille &#xD;
AND&#xD;
wound communication takes place.&#xD;
Traditional pedagogies’ disregard the intimate connection between energy and the body. This has paved the way for the massacre of ecosystems and war. War becomes an exertion of excess in a hollow and catastrophic way. &#xD;
&#xD;
Sirc in 1996 (Geoffrey, Ph.D.: Composition Theory, University of Minnesota, “Godless Composition, Tormented Writing”, http://jaconlinejournal.com/archives/vol15.3/sirc-godless.pdf,)&#xD;
&#xD;
Composition&amp;#39;s notion of &#xD;
AND&#xD;
of the possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
To think the possibility of a solar community requires rethinking the very notion of community itself.  It is to live out the incessant sacrifice of the God of security and oneness.  It is to enter into an intimate act of communication with others that refuses the drive for external authorization – a union without unity.  To live like suns, we must relinquish control.&#xD;
&#xD;
Biles 11 [Jeremy, Instructor in Religion, Philosophy &amp;#38; Art, “The Remains of God,” Culture, Theory and Critique 52.2-3, p. 141-3]&#xD;
&#xD;
It is reason elevated &#xD;
AND&#xD;
of God, at the end of eternity.&#xD;
&#xD;
Refuse debate’s traditional curriculum. Its hatred of chance enslaves us to catastrophic expenditure. The sacrificial pedagogy of the affirmative embraces the rupture life and opens spaces for desire.&#xD;
