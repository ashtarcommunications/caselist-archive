====This dance is a call for the production of a different kind of solar energy – not the solar power of fuel cells and the electricity grid, but the kind of solar energy that we tear from within ourselves through ecstasy and love.  This is the magical gesture of Vincent Van Gogh.====&#xD;

====Van Gogh~’s solar radiation invites a different approach to this year~’s resolution.  Debates concerning federal government energy policy are invariably constrained by a limited understanding of the world that fails to see it as the beneficiary of not ONE, but TWO, suns: a second sun, rotten with glory and waste – which is eclipsed by the drive to make the world useful.  Van Gogh~’s brilliance is that he braves an encounter with the sun from which most would avert their eyes.  His act of auto-mutilation is a production of an other solar energy, an energy other to the economy of productivity and utility.  By staring squarely into the &amp;#34;rotten sun,&amp;#34; Van Gogh becomes solar.====&#xD;

No less subversive of traditional occularcentrism was Bataille~’s unprecedented transfiguration of the familiar metaphor of &#xD;

&#xD;
&#xD;
====The sacrifice performed by Van Gogh occurs along a solar trajectory as part of a general economy of excess – he lived like a sun.  It was an expenditure that returned energy to the general solar economy through the production of ecstasy and waste.  The sun serves as the basis for life and, in turn, the ability to expend energy.  Life is an effect of the energy the sun squanders upon us without return: a unilateral, excessive, and wasteful burning. ====&#xD;

&#xD;
&#xD;
====The second sun blazes through the ecstatic convulsions of the body, which subverts the logic undergirding the American dream of unlimited economic growth and consumer comfort.  The standard interpretation of the topic would have affirmatives develop energy resources for ever-more efficient extraction and productive use.  We affirm a different vision of the resolution, a different understanding of solar energy.====&#xD;

&#xD;
====Just as the sun is doubled, so too is the figure of the United States federal government.  The flesh of the condemned marks the inverted double of the sovereign power of the state.  Our flesh is the beautiful and rotten excess produced through the relentless drive for production, but it therefore also marks the point at which sovereignty can be reappropriated.  We, the flesh of the United States federal government, are capable of reasserting the excessive enjoyment of life through sacrifice.  We, the flesh of the United States federal government, should gloriously sacrifice our flesh to live like suns.====&#xD;

====Against this vision of glorious solar expenditure, the logic of the American energy economy entails the catastrophic reduction of the world to a standing reserve.  This depersonalization of the experience of consumption renders intimate expenditure impossible.  The energy of the world becomes a thing to be stockpiled and quantified.

Bataille and Michelson 86 Georges and Annette (Prof of Cinema Studies), “Van Gogh as Prometheus,” October 36, 58-60, http://www.jstor.org/stable/778550
Van Gogh’s solar radiation invites a different approach to this year’s resolution.  Debates have been constrained by a limited understanding of the world that ignores that there are two suns. One view elevates the sun to be the ultimate source of truth and energy. The second sun, rotten with glory and waste is eclipsed by the drive to make the world useful.  Van Gogh’s act of auto-mutilation is a production of an other solar energy, energy other to the economy of productivity and utility.

No less subversive … meanings for Bataille.  

Van Gogh’s sacrifice occurred along a solar trajectory as apart of the general economy – he lived like a sun. It was a production of solar energy through waste and ecstasy. The sun serves as the basis for life and, in turn, the ability to expend energy.  Life is an effect of the sun squandering upon us without return: a unilateral, excessive, and wasteful burning. 

Land 92 Nick, Lecturer in Continental Philosophy at Warwick, The Thirst for Annihilation, p. 22-23

All human endeavour … end, be spent.



The affirmation of solar expenditure challenges the modern economy built on the destruction of nature for the production of comfort. A traditional interpretation of the resolution would ask us to build more solar panels or power the gird. This stockpiling of resources is inseparable from a modern subjectivity that desires stability and wholeness. The depersonalization of the experience of consumption renders intimate expenditure impossible.  

Stoekl 07 Allan, Prof of Comp Lit at Penn State, Bataille’s Peak: Energy, Religion, and Postsustainability, p.138-140

Thus Bataille’s affirmation … as ultimate signified.

Energy derived from fossil fuels is profoundly different from the energy affirmed by the affirmative. Solar energy pulses through the body, causing anguish and intimacy. For it is the lack of intimacy that contributes to the stockpiling of the standing reserve and the indifferent depletion of energy. Modern warfare reflects this lack of intimacy – war reduced to a calculation of use value

If we win that the Aff outweighs, then we should win the round.

(~-~-) We do affirm the topic – we may have a non-traditional interpretation of what it means, but we advocate for a reduction in the restrictions on solar energy production.

(~-~-) There are two US federal governments: the government of the law, located in Washington DC, and the government of flesh, inscribed on the bodies of the condemned.  These are two sides of a Mobius strip; we affirm that the second government should reappropriate sovereignty by living like a sun. This is an activation of a form of agency that denies the will to do work and stockpile resources into the standing reserve. That’s Hansen and Stepputat. 

(~-~-) Sacrificing our flesh removes the restriction of solar energy to the restricted economy. Sacrifice “Returns energy to its solar trajectory.” We become suns, beings that produce energy without reserve – That’s land in 92

The political order is constituted by beings that refuse glorious expenditure. Any T version of the aff that tries to fit into their interpretation is bankrupt. Their deliberation arguments are insulated conversations among people of privilege.

The “Programme” begins …. rather than utopian.

 (~-~-) Our affirmative must begin by thinking the body – belief that the USFG can incentivize or remove restrictions on glorious expenditure constitutes a continuation of the cycle of management. Sirc indicates that rethinking pedagogy to focus on the body counters this destructive impulse. 

 (~-~-) Counter-interpretation – the Aff should present a topical advocacy.  Framework is irrelevant because it’s an externally imposed vision of what debate should look like.  Our only obligation is to affirm the resolution.

(~-~-) Their interpretation is a fracturing of the resolution – language doesn’t exist in a vacuum where the definition of each word in a sentence creates meaning. Language like the sun is subject to a reading that is glorious and rotten. We choose the glorious reading. 

(~-~-) Community Building Disad – a homogenous community certifies its own death because it does not adapt to different forms of discourse. Sacrificing our flesh creates a community of difference instead of isolating and demonizing others. That’s Biles. 

 (~-~-) Framework begs the question of the Aff – the limits of framework are impossible and bad because excess will overflow them. Framework is the catastrophic desire to manage excess – making us unable to expend energy any way that doesn’t destroy being. The 1AC is a giant impact turn to their fw. 

(~-~-) Rupture disad - Reject their framework- it’s an appeal to stabilize and indoctrinate the affirmative’s rupture to the American energy logic. Sirc indicates that this is a hatred of the unknown that furthers domination.

Their link argument is an inaccurate reading of Bataille. Production and consumption that maintains a personal goal of *consumer freedom* ignores the destabilizing of the self and the intimate connection to energy.

Waste based on ….  of ecosystems (today). 

Capitalism is our advantage - Stoekl states that the homogenous nature of the status quo establishes its dominance via unchecked consumerism. Energy is quantified and produced to sustain a relaxed livelihood. We are a reversal – glorious expenditure is unconcerned with maintaining bourgeoisie comfort. 

Permutation- sacrifice our flesh and engage in historical analysis– the aff is critical to rethink our relationship with energy production. 

Either the alternative necessitates the aff because their historical analysis leads them to expend energy gloriously, thus the permutation solves or the alternative rejects the aff, which makes case a disad to the alt. 

Capitalisms ills derive from the confusion of restrained and general economies. Our sacrifice entails spending without regard to the future and a refusal of the use-value of things.

Glorious expenditure is not exclusive to women - women can sacrifice their flesh as well - walking / bicycling. 
The alternative presupposes biological essentialism - people who are not biopoligical &amp;#34;female&amp;#34; but identify with the feminine gender location would be excluded by the alt - IE: transgender people or folks who are not normatively &amp;#34;female&amp;#34;
Bataille breaks down the phallic subjectivity that they are critiquing. Their link arguments are fundamentally misreadings of Irigaray’s philosophy.  The permutation is the best way to create sexual difference. 
Ladelle McWhorter 1995 “Is There Sexual Difference in the Work of Georges Bataille?”; International studies in philosophy vol.27 iss.1; Found on  P 40-41
Bataille does not ….  comes to speech.

The alternative cannot solve our impacts – recognizing sexual difference is insufficient to criticize the way that energy becomes stockpiled and places the environment into the standing reserve. 

The negative’s analysis of “sexual difference” presents oppression as a singular and monolithic construction – this is the colonization of the Third World experience who do not experience oppression differently.

Walonen 12 Michael, Assist Prof of English, “The Black and Cruel Demon,” Interdisciplinary Literary Studies 14.1, p.57
No other commodity… relating to one another.

The ontology of oil is the central structuring principle of our sociopolitical imaginary
Szeman 10 Imre, Prof of English and Sociology, “The Cultural Politics of Oil,” Polygraph 22, p.34
Oil was everywhere,… dance of commodity reification

Even the so-called “green” alternatives to oil are locked within the naturalized logic of the oil economy
Hitchcock 12 Peter, Prof of English at CUNY, “Everything’s Gone Green,” Imaginations, p.105-6

Since my discussion is about… parabola in oil’s future.

The material geography enabled by oil ontology is the basis of the modern neoliberalism and the depoliticization of the public sphere 
Huber 11 Matthew, Assist Prof of Geography, “Oil, Life, and the Fetishism of Geopolitics,” Capitalism Nature Socialism 22.3, p.41-4

While ecological economists… ideologies of ‘‘hostile privatism.’’

Neoliberalism undergirds the structural violence that produces the invisibility and disposability of entire populations. 
Giroux 06 Henry A., Professor at McMaster University in English and Cultural Studies Department, “Reading Hurricane Katrina: Race, Class, and the Biopolitics of Disposability”, College Literature 33.3  171-196

I want to further this position… followed Hurricane Katrina.

Automobility is the material condition enabling the leveling of the being and the reduction of the world to a disposable standing reserve
Backhaus 09 Gary, Prof of Philosophy and Executive Committee for the Society for Phenomenology, “Automobility: Global Warming as Symptomatology,” Sustainability, p.201-2

The modern world… life is unsustainable.

This is the basis of all violence and destruction – even threats of nuclear war are derivative of the destruction of Being
Caputo 93 Gender Paraphrased John, Prof of Religiou and Philosophy, Demythologizing Heidegger, p. 136-41

The essence of technology… authentic, ontological destruction.

Status quo discourses on oil focuses on the geopolitics of oil production – this participates in the fetishization of the oil economy and masks the social relations that produce it as on object of power.
Huber 11 Matthew, Assist Prof of Geography, “Oil, Life, and the Fetishism of Geopolitics,” Capitalism Nature Socialism 22.3, p.35-7

From a left perspective… global economy is assured.


Thus, the plan: the United States federal government should remove the fetish restriction on the production of crude oil.

Moving beyond the fetishism of oil requires constructing new social imaginaries through which oil is understood as a historically contingent social relationship
Huber 11 Matthew, Assist Prof of Geography, “Oil, Life, and the Fetishism of Geopolitics,” Capitalism Nature Socialism 22.3, p.37, 44

The geopolitics of oil… post-petroleum future

Imagining a society without the fetish of oil exposes the fragility of automobile social relations and reconfigures the coordinates of political possibility
Bohm 06 Steffen, Dir. Of the Essex Sustainability Institute and Prof of Management and Sustainability, “Introduction: Impossibilities of Automobility,” The Sociological Review, p.13-5

One way of enacting… of moving beyond it.

A fundamental paradigm shift is needed to overcome the problems of the status quo – this involves reconfiguring our manner of perceiving the world and evaluating consequences.
Yu 09 Jung-Min, Policy Fellow at the Institute of Environmental Justice, “Political Economy of Power Liberalization and Power Transformation,” PhD Dissertation, Proquest, p.102-10

Illich (1974) argues that… displaces the old one.

The plan embodies a politics of hope that is necessary to challenge the depoliticizing cynicism of neoliberalism
Giroux 04 (Henry, Prof of Comm @ McMaster, The Terror of Neoliberalism, p. 135-7)

He argues that hope… engaged political agents.

Radical democratic politics must refuse the assumption that the state and civil society are discrete – the technocratic view of policy-making fetishizes the state, failing to see it as a product of social relations of power.
Lemke 07 (Thomas, German Science Foundation-heisenberg fellow, “An Indigestible Meal?” Distinktion 15, http://www.thomaslemkeweb.de/publikationen/Indigestible%20Meal%20-%20Proofs.pdf)
