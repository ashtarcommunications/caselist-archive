==== Plan: The United States Federal Government should amend the Indian Tribal Energy Development and Self-Determination Act and all relevant sections of other federal laws to remove all environmental review and comment provisions from Tribal Energy Resource Agreements. ====

 

==== Federal subjugation of Indigenous peoples is systemic and rooted in the colonialist notion that Indigenous peoples gave sovereignty to America, and that the federal government owes them protection as a “dependent nation”. ====

==== Federal Trustee statutes are interpreted by the United States to either place Indigenous peoples in a dependent status or to protect Indigenous peoples from government intervention- both notions are colonialist and based on the choices of the US, not the Indigenous peoples. ====

==== TERA restrictions don’t apply to state governments and are stricter than restrictions on the Federal government- this discrepancy is indicative of the flawed mindset of colonialism guiding policy toward Indigenous peoples. ====

==== Colonialism inflicts massive daily suffering, dehumanizing populations. The impact is sustained and perpetual.  It outweighs any one-shot impacts. ====

==== TERA restrictions allow the Federal government to maintain ultimate control over Indigenous peoples. ====

==== TERA environmental review mandates are a form of biopolitical control- they force Indigenous peoples to gain the approval of State officials for actions on their own land, treating Indigenous land as if it were owned by the federal government. ====

==== Environmental assessments under federal standards crowd out alternative knowledge, while indigenous control creates new knowledge production which rectify essentialist boundaries of race and nature and augments technoscience ====

==== TERAs are guises for extending Federal managerial control- they shift all risk to the Indigenous peoples while empowering the Federal government to monitor, control, and dominate Indigenous decision making. ====

==== Removing TERA restrictions is key to breaking down the biopolitical control the Federal government exercises over Indigenous decision making- Federal involvement creates the poverty and exclusion that traps Indigenous peoples in a state of dependence. ====

=== TERAs can uniquely provide recognition of equality, with the potential to dramatically increase Indigenous self-determination while reducing the role of the Federal Government. ===
