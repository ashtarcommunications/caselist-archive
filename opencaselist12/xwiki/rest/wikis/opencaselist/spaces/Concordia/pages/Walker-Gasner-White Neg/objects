This privileges a single way of¶ viewing the world and forecloses alternative modes of thought.====&#xD;

====One of the many “truths” the affirmative posits is the stories they call “advantages”. These projections of decline and catastrophe are technological behavior in that they map out and calculate the future in order to create a standing reserve of symptoms.====&#xD;
Heidegger 62  (Martin. “Die Technik und die Kehre”, pp.45-6)&#xD;
Only when insight brings itself … s everything into it’s own.&#xD;
 &#xD;
====A world subsumed by calculative technological thought destroys our ontological relationship with Being. Our instant access to everything as a tool for use obliterates the essential being of all things making even total planetary destruction a radically less important issue and a likely inevitability.====&#xD;
Caputo 93 (john, Demythologizing Heidegger, p. 136-41)&#xD;
The essence of technology is …, ontological destruction.&#xD;
 &#xD;
====Our alternative is to embrace gelassenheit. The first step is “Releasement towards things” – this will allow us to become aware that technology is useful, but shackles us. Awareness can break the shackles, denying technology the right to dominate our existence. The second step is “openness to the mystery.”  This is a “higher action” that means we do not demand answers – we wait. This is how we transform our thinking from calculative to meditative. We have to wait to allow Being to reveal itself to us.====&#xD;
Dalle pezze 2006 (Barbara, PhD in Philosophy U of Hong Kong, “Heidegger on Gelassenheit”, Minerva 10:94-122)&#xD;
When we think meditatively we do not p … ‘just’ wait, wait without expecting.&#xD;

====Our alternative is to reject the affirmative. Vote neg—It’s try or die for the revolution. The capitalism is unsustainable and reforms only insure the crash is worse—this makes total rejection key====
