==== The judges should vote negative to deny their capacity to act as subjects. ====

==== While the actual completion of the act is structurally impossible, the contemplation of questions it presents are the only way to situate debate on true questions of ethics. Rejection of this call manifests the fundamental disavow of black suffering that affirms the capacity and ethicalility of the neg team while black suffering that makes that capacity intelligible in the first place. This mediation is precursor to all legal interrogations, for only here can the epistemological blindness of white academia be confronted with the fundamental ethic truth that turns assumptive logic of all their scholarship on its head; for it is Incapacity, not Agency, that is the only ethic stance. In a world of SLAVES it is UNETHICAL TO BE FREE. It is only in moments of Incapacity, can ethics and thus all subsequent legal questions become coherent ====
