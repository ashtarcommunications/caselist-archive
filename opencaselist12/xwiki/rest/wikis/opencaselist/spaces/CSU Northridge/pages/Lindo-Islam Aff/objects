RES has no doubt that cumulatively, the new regulatory program—as drafted— will:&#xD;
(i) Provide little to no certainty that adherence to the Eagle Guidance will enable projects to avoid regulatory ~’~’surprises~’~’ imposed by the USFWS later in the development and operation of the facility; Significantly, and unjustifiably, increase the time and costs required to develop a wind energy facility, thereby increasing development risk/uncertainty;&#xD;
(iii) As a result of (i) and (ii) above, create significant barriers to obtaining acceptable&#xD;
project financing.&#xD;
For example, the Eagle Guidance:&#xD;
• Imposes a five-year permit term for eagle ~’~’take~’~’ permits, which &#xD;
AND&#xD;
, this could trigger NEPA for wind projects on public and private land.&#xD;
• Provides that after a project is permitted, project operators may be required to modify operations or introduce additional mitigation measures with no certainty that any such requirements will be reasonable, practical, economical or technically feasible. This is problematic because such modifications or mitigation may abrogate existing contractual requirements, thereby putting a project into default. As such, this has the potential to render project financing infeasible.&#xD;

With the decline of American global pre-eminence, weaker countries will be more susceptible to the assertive influence of major regional powers.&#xD;

3. South Korea&#xD;
The United States has been the guarantor of South Korea~’s security since it was attacked &#xD;

out of shared democratic values and fear of aggression from Pyongyang and Beijing.&#xD;
At stake: Military and economic security on the Korean Peninsula; a general crisis of confidence in Japan and South Korea regarding the reliability of existing American commitments.&#xD;
4. Belarus&#xD;
Twenty years after the fall of the Soviet Union, Europe~’s last dictatorship remains politically and economically dependent on Russia. One-third of its exports go to Russia, on which it is almost entirely reliant for its energy needs. At the same time, President Aleksandr Lukashenko~’s 17-year dictatorship has stood in the way of any meaningful relations with the West. Consequently, a marked American decline would give Russia a virtually risk-free opportunity to reabsorb Belarus.&#xD;

Although Islamabad is armed with 21st-century nuclear weapons and held together by a &#xD;
AND&#xD;

8. Israel (and the greater Middle East)&#xD;
American decline would set in motion tectonic shifts undermining the political stability of the entire Middle East.

Observation One: The Resolution
1. The resolution forces debaters to provide a plan of action through the USFG – adopting this traditional style of debate sustains white culture and epistemology excluding better forms of epistemology such as critical hip-hop pedagogy. 
Perkinson 05’ 
Associate Professor of Philosophy and Religious Studies at Marygrove College and of Social Ethics at Ecumenical Theological Seminary,’James W., Shamanism, racism and hip hop culture (pg. 120-122)JB
In the face of such an invaded circumstance, black survival could then be understood
AND
we can identify the one operation that gives whiteness a certain common character.

Observation Two: Our Topic Analysis
The energy topic was created to privilege wealthy participants that are closely related to the resolution. This creates a system of exclusion in where underprivileged students cannot relate to the topic. 
Warner 2012 
Ede, Jr... GO HOMERS, MAKEOVERS OR TAKEOVERS? A PRIVILEGE ANALYSIS OF DEBATE AS A GAMING SIMULATION. CONTEMPORARY ARGUMENTATION AND DEBATE.  . 71
Procedures for topic selection as well as arguments made in debates are certainly grounded in 
AND
but evidence of substantial retention must be demonstrated, not just introductory participation.


Energy topic is rooted in racism – The USFG marginalizes blacks ignoring their health, lives, values, and commodifies their bodies.

Environmental racism occurs when hazardous industries and facilities are placed in and near poor, 
AND
air or water or anything else for the radiation we know is there. 

We don’t believe that the USFG should be the dominant actor in addressing the plan. 
White supremacy has transplanted itself in Western culture – dictating which resources can be utilized and which forms of knowledge are produced. These practices are often utilized into different forms of domination that manifest themselves as a white fear of blackness. This fear has infiltrated the debate space in the form of ‘fiat’ in the sense that it attempts to erase all signs of difference to safeguard “traditional” ideals of what this space should.

Observation Four: Alternative Solvency
1. Engaging debate through critical hip-hop pedagogy functions as a significant mode of cultural and political expression – this challenges eurocentric epistemology in what impact the debate.

Arguably more than any other subgroup of Americans, African American youth 
reflect the challenges 
AND
develop oppositional political attitudes, or feel greater alienation from the political system? 

2. The ballot should go to whoever best challenges traditional paradigms, racial issues, and oppression. The affirmative does it best through critical hip-hop pedagogy – provides a framework to challenge systems that reproduce social inequality and key to solvency.

Alternative energy is rooted within a technological mode of thinking that utilizes energy as a form of commodification – placing nature as merely being relevant to human-centric needs that marginalizes all natural objective identity. 
Beckman in 2000 says, 
Emeritus Professor of Philosophy Tad, Harvey Mudd College, Martin Heidegger and Environnmental Ethics, page @ http://www2.hmc.edu/~tbeckman/personal/HEIDART.HTML
Heidegger clearly saw the development of &amp;#34;energy resources&amp;#34; as symbolic of this evolutionary 
AND
their subjective status of standing-ready for human design. (8)

This reinforces a technological drive for control and mastery of the planet, which turns all other beings into a ‘standing reserve’ .

Technology is the chief historical ramification of the subjectivism introduced by Western metaphysical thought. 
AND
ramification and contributing condition, not the origin or case, of subjectivism. 
Metaphysical subjectivism generates a flawed ontology that views humans as the “subject” and nature as the “object”. Thus, establishing the Human-Non Human binary that causes extinction by divorcing our relationship with the natural world and making ecocide on a cosmic scale inevitable.

Gottlieb, Professor of Humanities at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, holds a Ph.D. in Philosophy from Brandeis University, 1994 (“Ethics and Trauma: Levinas, Feminism, and Deep Ecology,” Crosscurrents: A Journal of Religion and Intellectual Life, Summer, Available Online at http://www.crosscurrents.org/feministecology.htm, Accessed 07-26-2011)
Here I will at least begin in agreement with Levinas. As he rejects an

neither for our selves nor for the other, but for us all.

Chapter Two: The Human/Non-Human Binary
The Human/Non-Human Binary becomes inherent in “subhuman thinking” – this is one of many tools where violence can be justified and applied to racially inferior groups. 
Deckha 2k10

While the intersection of race and gender is often acknowledged in understanding the etiology of 
AND
, sex, culture and species that lays the foundation for the violence. 





The “sub-human thinking” reinforces unending genocidal violence against other domains of life that are considered politically unqualified.

Chapter Three: Financial Incentives
State’s financial incentives’ commodifies nature to further technological advancements. This becomes part of the neoliberal project in order to ensure domination by elites, and reinforce calculative thinking.

In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, governments and international finance   organizations began 
AND
and performatively promoting calculative (and therefore calculable) behavior   across all fields.



Technological advancements are used for economic means  - this ignores the damage done to the environment and subordinates feminine values

Modem technology is the means to generate economic profit . Since the greed of the 
AND
disgraceful in the hard, rational, masculine, competitive, individual world.

Calculative thoughts reinforce patriarchal domination and exploitation of women – undervaluing and marginalizing feminine epistemologies.

One of the most interesting directions ecofeminist analyses has proceeded concerns science, technology, 
AND
yin forces. Therefore, this dualism is the essence of this chapter.

Advocacy Statement: Rashed and I affirm critical ontology as an axis of reconceptualizing alternative energy by means of recognizing the patterns of interconnectedness within nature. 
Role of The Ballot ~-~-
Chapter Three: To Cross the Threshold…
In order to escape the realm of technological thinking, we must cross the threshold to a transcendent state of mind in which we reconceptualize energy as domains of beings. Critical Ontology allows us examine the patterns of interconnectedness within nature.

Toronto: University of Toronto Press., Page 15) BAL
As we begin to identify previously unperceived patterns in which the self is implicated, 
AND
the self and their relationship in all of the complexity such study requires.

Critical Ontology becomes essential in understanding the concept of Bare Life – this is key to diminishing “species thinking”.

We are all equally reduced to mere specimens of human biology, mute and uncomprehending 
AND
exploitation, how are we to envision the future of politics and society?

And through our advocacy – we gain a better reconceptualization of “the human” and the “non-human”.

The aim, however, would be to not just accept one side or the 
AND
only so long as it understands itself as a part of the latter.
