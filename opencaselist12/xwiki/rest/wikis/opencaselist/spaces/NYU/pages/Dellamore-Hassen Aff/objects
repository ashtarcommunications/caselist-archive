Coherent energy policy is inarticulable in the current political paradigm- inherent contradictions with the system of infinite growth have left politics at a stalemate
Ophuls and Boyan, 1992 (William and A. Stephan, Fmr U.S Foreign Service Officer and Phd in Political Science, associate professor emeritus of political science at UMBC, Ecology and the Politics of Scarcity Revisited, pp.250) NG
None of the tendencies… intolerable levels of pollution.
Moreover these policies rely on a static vision of energy and cannot answer the question of “sustainable energy development”
Ophuls and Boyan, 1992 (William and A. Stephan, Fmr U.S Foreign Service Officer and Phd in Political Science, associate professor emeritus of political science at UMBC, Ecology and the Politics of Scarcity Revisited, pp 122-123) NG
Although progress towards a… means where necessary.
Democratic Politics as they exist cannot survive the crisis they have created. Reformist policies based on static interpretations of energy only address the symptoms of absolute scarcity
Ophuls and Boyan, 1992 (William and A. Stephan, Fmr U.S Foreign Service Officer and Phd in Political Science, associate professor emeritus of political science at UMBC, Ecology and the Politics of Scarcity Revisited, pp. XI-XII) NG
The environmental handwriting… change and social cacophony.
Further, continued marginal reforms will only sustain the crisis in more insidious forms
Ophuls and Boyan, 1992 (William and A. Stephan, Fmr U.S Foreign Service Officer and Phd in Political Science, associate professor emeritus of political science at UMBC, Ecology and the Politics of Scarcity Revisited) pp.3-5 NG
This book argues, to… by examining basic concept.
Contention 2 is the Tragedy of the Commons
New expansions of energy policy are rooted in the logic of continued consumption. The culmination of scarcity and flawed energy policy is a “crunch” that will destroy the biosphere
Ophuls, 1997 (William, former Foreign Service Officer, PhD in political science from Yale University, “Requiem for Modern Politics”, pp. 5-7)NG
Another way of viewing … their implications in more depth.
The topic as it exists is flawed- new forms and expansion of energy on exacerbates the logic of the commons- we can no longer afford to think of humans external to the natural world lest extinction become inevitable
Ophuls, 1997 (William, former Foreign Service Officer, PhD in political science from Yale University, “Requiem for Modern Politics”, pp. 7-8)NG
Human beings have profoundly …more we ultimately impoverish ourselves.
This form of technological thinking creates a framework of reliance and reaction, ensuring that the crunch is more deadly and totalitarian
Ophuls and Boyan, 1992 (William and A. Stephan, Fmr U.S Foreign Service Officer and Phd in Political Science, associate professor emeritus of political science at UMBC, Ecology and the Politics of Scarcity Revisited, pp. 211-212) NG
Modern humanity has used… compatible with our values.
Humanities abandonment of ecological harmony has led to amoral selfishness- leads to impersonal warfare and the extinction of all life
Ophuls, 2011
(William, former Foreign Service Officer, PhD in political science from Yale University, “Platos Revenge: Politics in the Age of Ecology”, pp. 2-4) NG
From this perspective, the …. is measured has grown enormously.
This amorality spills over to become a parasitic and self-absorbed form of politics, culminating in corporate authoritarianism
Ophuls, 1997 (William, former Foreign Service Officer, PhD in political science from Yale University, “Requiem for Modern Politics”, pp. 55-56)NG
Hobbes&amp;#39;s failure is ironic…us toward a Hobbesian future.
Thus, Nate and I endorse facing the environmental music rather than rather than let scarcity force us into an era of unwanted political change and social cacophony through the politics of the steady state
Contention 3: Envisioning New Horizons
The role of politics and debate is to articulate new possibilities for progress. Problematizing the logic of the mindset surrounding energy creates new and subversive forms of reality
Ophuls and Boyan, 1992 (William and A. Stephan, Fmr U.S Foreign Service Officer and Phd in Political Science, associate professor emeritus of political science at UMBC, Ecology and the Politics of Scarcity Revisited) NG
Second, at this juncture… long to come to our senses.
The most fundamental question is if energy as the resolution represents it sustainable and compatible with human survival? Envisioning post-growth, steady-state aligned worlds is crucial to politics and survival
Ophuls and Boyan, 1992 (William and A. Stephan, Fmr U.S Foreign Service Officer and Phd in Political Science, associate professor emeritus of political science at UMBC, Ecology and the Politics of Scarcity Revisited) NG
Marx’s utopian assessment… to meet the challenge.
Only an ethical alignment with ecology can cure the hubris of technocracy and expose the illusions of modern politics
Ophuls, 2011
(William, former Foreign Service Officer, PhD in political science from Yale University, “Platos Revenge: Politics in the Age of Ecology”, pp. 28-29) NG
With this brief justification … human humility, moderation, and connection.
Our advocacy is the only way to create space for political progress. Remaining within modern democratic politics ensures failure because it rests on flawed understandings of energy and consumption
Ophuls, 1997 (William, former Foreign Service Officer, PhD in political science from Yale University, “Requiem for Modern Politics”, pp. IX-XII)NG

Criticisms of whiteness demonize all white people rather than social domination and white racism- this guarantees failure- their strategy devolves into white-washing and political nihilism

Rather than offering a way ... necessary to abolish racist practice.


White supremacy is dead in this space and we speak from a point of power
By calling attention to and asserting our power, we highlight the good work being done to bring down structural racism. Their method limits the connection to current policy development by ignoring this opportunity to engage in the current policy debate and detaching from the resolution.   We represent part of a mass communication strategy which is essential to shape the larger policy debate.  Every victory builds our power to move future policy.

Good work is taking ... an explicit structural racism analysis.


Our methodology requires talking about power, building objectives and establishing tools for local control.  This methodology arises from the most comprehensive study ever done on power and issues of race.

The means is our speech act which is a cultural work and a powerful metaphor.   Since a movement’s collective identity is continually emerging and reforming between groups, the debate round becomes a place for expression.   The movement ‘s strength is contingent on its creation.  We become the starting point when we value our expression and place those values in words.   Our advocacy stands as a cultural work and our metaphor gives it explicit value

We begin with a narrative from Adam Burke

Burke 08, (Adam, Writer for NPR) December 4, 2008 “Sucked into the tunnels underneath Las Vegas” http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=97800190

It would be easy to ... No reason to doubt him.

This year the resolution calls us to address the policies of energy policy in the United States. However, our affirmation of energy policy requires an investment not in fiatted monetary terms but instead an investment in what lies beneath the streets, beneath the flickering pulse of the bright lights and big cities we’re taught to see as centers of American liberty and freedom 

Abu-Jamal 98 (Mumia Abu-Jamal 1998 “A QUIET AND DEADLY VIOLENCE,”  9/19/98, http://www.mumia.nl/TCCDMAJ/quietdv.htm)

It has often been observed that ... of every decade, throughout the world.&amp;#34; Gilligan, p. 196

AND - We need to challenge the current invisibility of structural violence amongst our communities. The normal functioning of debate, much like our current functioning of modern American society, constructs a methodological distinction between groups of people, deeming them a part of the in crowd or the out crowd...Discussions are either “topical” or “not-topical” – relevant or irrelevant. This constant issue excludes the oppressed from our discussions, further distancing the oppressed from ourselves, contributing to the systematic violence present in the status-quo. This is what leads an invisible genocide committed against the weak and poor throughout the world. We propose an inclusionary approach through our relationships within our debate community, debate&amp;#39;s discursive potential, and the appreciation and acceptance of diverse ways of viewing the world, including the world in which we live in and the world in which we debate in, in order to discontinue the invisibility of structural violence.

Winter and Leighton in 1999 (Deborah DuNann Winter and Dana C. Leighton. Winter: Psychologist that specializes in Social Psych, Counseling Psych, Historical and Contemporary Issues, Peace Psychology. Leighton: PhD graduate student in the Psychology Department at the University of Arkansas. Knowledgable in the fields of social psychology, peace psychology, and ustice and intergroup responses to transgressions of justice) (Peace, conflict, and violence: Peace psychology in the 21st century.  Pg 4-5)

Finally, to recognize the operation of ... can also be used to empower citizens to reduce it.

Therefore the Role of The Ballot for this debate is to endorse a political discussion emphasizing the voices of the oppressed people affected by energy policy as we debate this year’s resolution. Resolved: The United States federal government should substantially increase financial incentives for and/or substantially reduce regulatory restrictions on certain energy productions. Your ballot acts as an endorsement of a brand of politics capable of challenging the violent norms of the status quo, voting aff is the act pressing down on the elevator taking a look at what goes down underneath the streets.

The failure to incorporate the lives of those who are oppressed by our politics can only lead to more oppressive politics… and eventually the failure of our politics. 

Friere 70 (Paulo Friere, Pedagogy of the Oppressed, Chapter 1, educator and director of the Department of Cultural  Extension of Recife University,1970)

For the truly humanist educator ... invasion,11good intentions notwithstanding

Our affirmation of the resolution escapes the politics of business as usual - opening up agency that resists the sovereigns command over all life and beauty. We resist that which robs our political projects of agency and commitment.

Wadiwel 02 (Dinesh Joesph, “Cows and Sovereignty: Biopower and Animal Life” Borderlands E-Journal Vol.1 #2)

But such a political program ... life shared by both entities.

Before we start cross-x we wish to return ourselves to the discussion of the poor. Help for one another goes beyond any material condition in the world. Voting affirmative understands our advocacy as not only a call of material responsibility but also that of spiritual responsibility. Politics minus an understanding of non-material conditions lead to psychic genocide.

The poor may be with ... needs in daily life as well as needs of the spirit.
