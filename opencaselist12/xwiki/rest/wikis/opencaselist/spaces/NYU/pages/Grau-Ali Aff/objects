2) The affirmative reframes “essence” and “acting” in the context of ecology- which is a pre-req to their ontological calculations and comparatively outweighs the risk of link

 Despite the merits … inspire true collective action. 


3) Permutation do both- it’s a question of material sustainability, not harmonization or the transformation of humans into subjects that can interact with technology, the crunch proves that relationality insofar as it relates to sustainable ethics with the natural world is not only crucial to avert the crunch, it is inevitable as a result of natural limits.  The only question is whether the transformation of post-growth societies will be totalitarian and biopolitical or whether it will be benevolent and able to sustain some technological practices that enrich our lives.

Everyday we continue the extinction of the communities of the planet at every level of this complex series of ecosystems. These travesties cross lines of race, species, and status all under the guise of  “progress and technology.” Ultimately, it is a question of agency and appetites. 

AbdelRahim in 8 &amp;#123;Layla, Beyond the Symbolic and towards the Collapse May http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/layla-abdelrahim-beyond-the-symbolic-and-towards-the-collapse}

Those who are worried about the collapse of their system...who dug our diamonds and coal. 

 

Measures proposed to address environmental degradation reflect the appetites by vested interests.  They protect structures of power that are implicated in the perpetuation of environmental problems.

Tuathail in 98 (Gearóid Ó, prof -Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State Univ.The Geopolitics Reader, 1998, pgs. 7)

Co-existing with these discourses on the new world order...in the creation and perpetuation of environmental problems.

 

The system is imploding and we’re stuck inside. The nuclear is at point of obsessive stockpiling of information, security and regulations that collapses into an absurdity of useless databases, repressed anxiety and regulatory nightmares that is a tipping point for systems of control beyond which control is lost.

Baudrillard ’95 (Jean, “Simulacra and Simulation: The Precession of  Simulacra”, pp. 41-42)

The nuclear is at once the culminating point...a reversion of energies toward a minimal threshold.

 

The folly of such measures is apparent in the overshoot of the nuclear industry that is gripped in delusional rhetoric at the highest levels. They ignore the reality of renewables in favor of lies about nuclear.

Godoy in 12 &amp;#123;Julio-InterPress Service Agency Mainstream Rhetoric on Nuclear Power Far From Reality http://www.ipsnews.net/2012/08/mainstream-rhetoric-on-nuclear-power-far-from-reality/}

The catastrophe following the meltdown...over the same period,&amp;#34; he said.

 

The US indulges this fantasy by fueling a nuclear renaissance.

Worthington, 12 – contributing editor for SmartPlanet (David, 2/9. “The U.S. nuclear renaissance has begun.” http:~/~/www.smartplanet.com/blog/intelligent-energy/the-us-nuclear-renaissance-has-begun/13058url:http://www.smartplanet.com/blog/intelligent-energy/the-us-nuclear-renaissance-has-begun/13058)

These are cooling towers on the horizon in the United States...cost of US$14 billion, CNN reported.

 

Plan Text: The United States federal government should amend Section 202 subsection 4 (a) (i) of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to raise renewables incentives allocation from 60% 80%.

 

Observation two: The Perfect Storm

The powerful expand the concept of security from traditional issues like war to include the environment. This framing of the environment spills over massively expanding government power and justifying militarism and the most authoritarian response.

Waever 1995, Senior Researcher at the Center for Peace and Conflict Research, (Ole, On Security, p. 63-64)

Central to the arguments for the conceptual innovation...in the name of the environment.

 

The powerful within the nation-state exercise a hold over thinking which inhibits a central reorientation and limits resistant scholarship. We must not allow these restrictions to constrain our intellectual imagination.

Biswas 7 (Shampa, Professor of Politics at Whitman College, December, “Empire and Global Public Intellectuals: Reading Edward Said as an International Relations Theorist,” Millennium: Journal of International Studies, Vol. 36, No. 1, p. 125-126)
In making the case for the exilic orientation...while remaining blind to those of one&amp;#39;s own.

 

In its endless search for threats, the state launches violent crusades against the marginalized- ensuring escalating wars and cycles of violence

Connoly in 2k (William, Professor and Chair of the Department of Political Science @ Johns Hopkins University, Identity/Difference, expanded edition)

In several domains, the state no longer...by the civilization of productivity itself.

 

Threats and the search for security have transfixed the state on spectacle, a worship of realpolitik that insures that escalation and creation of threats that are not reflections of the material world

Baudrillard, 2004 (Jean, The Phantom Menace “The Intelligence of Evil or the Lucidity Pact,” 117-121)

At this present stage of a networking...(with a savagery that is no longer natural, but technical).

 

The powerful believe in the permanence of consumption as a pathway to protection propping up the security apparatus in dangerous ways. The emergency mentality joins national security in the fight for environmental security further feeding the paranoid state.

Neocleous 2008 (Mark is a Professor of the Critique of Political Economy; Head of Department of Politics and History, he joined Brunel University in the Department of Government in 1994. Since then he has published numerous books and articles. His most recent work has been towards the development of a critique of security. “CRITIQUE OF SECURITY” 2008. Pg. 154-155)

Because the need for security is so amorphous...an inescapable feature of bourgeois society.

 

The hidden justification for this “power grab” is militarism and the security norms

Washingtons in 12 (Nuclear Power Is Expensive and Bad for the Environment … It’s Being Pushed Because It Is Good For Making Bombs Apr11 by WashingtonsBlog)

If nuclear energy is expensive and bad...just promoters for the nuclear cycle.

 

This security fetishism and drive to create order causes destabilization and extinction

Dillon and Campbell 1992 (Michael, @ Lancaster U, and David @ Newcastle U, “The Political Subject of Violence”, p. 163-164,)

**Edited for Gendered Language

This interpretation of violence...at home in any other house.

 

Contention 3: Outcomes of the struggle

To say we solve would be an exercise in arrogance and a continuation of the insolence we indict. Our advocacy can be judged to be productive if our actions raise enough questions about energy production choices based in securitized language. By questioning, we can contest the politics of security that render technologically calculable objects that characterize international relations. We must think about the very foundations of the system.

Dillon 1996 Michael, professor Politics and International Relations at the University of Lancaster, The Politics of Security, pp. 22-23

Contesting our politics of security...belonging together of security and insecurity.

 

The proportional balance required by the energy policy act of 2005 creates direct tradeoffs between renewables and nuclear energy because the total portfolio must add up to 100%.

Section 1212(a) of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (42 U.S.C. 13317(a))

&amp;#34;(4)(A) Subject to subparagraph (B)...for the fiscal year to other projects.

 

This power already rests with the Secretary in the language of the law. No new legislation is required to pass it.

Section 202 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005

The language of Section 202...percentage requirements of subparagraph (A).&amp;#34;

 

By restricting those in power and engaging our places as individuals in the real world we locate the mechanisms to avoid contributing to the climate of fear and hopelessness that undermines those who hope to organize

Lichterman 2009 (Andrew is a lawyer and policy analyst Western States Legal Foundation, “Disarmament work amidst a global economic crisis”, 8/6/09, disarmamentactivist.org/.../Lichterman%20Hiroshima%20Day%202009.pdf)

We also must take back our politics...inequities of the global system as a whole.

 

Now is a key time to expose the big lie of the institutions that shape our stories. Exposure is a precursor to a change of consciousness essential to resisting soft authoritarianism.  Informed citizens that can both imagine and act responsibly.  It is key to our survival

Giroux 12 Henry, Global TV Network Chair Professorship, McMaster Univ, English and Cultural Studies Dept, “Beyond the Politics of the Big Lie: The Education Deficit and the New Authoritarianism” June 6,http://truth-out.org/opinion/item/9865-beyond-the-politics-of-the-big-lie-the-education-deficit-and-the-new-authoritarianism

For the first time in modern history...becoming more normalized and dangerous.

 

The lies of the nuclear power industry rest at the center of the security myths and represent a dangerous diversion. Changing the subsidy balance tackles the nuclear nightmare so it cannot crowd out safer technologies and opens the door to better choices globally.

Levendis Block and Morrel in 9 &amp;#123;John, Walter, Joseph Morrel Journal of Business Ethics (2006)  67:37–49 P46 http://www.walterblock.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/Nuclear-Power.pdf Spring}

The present paper is neither pro nor anti-nuclear...energy technologies and energy efficiency.

 

Securitizing the environment without a serious reorientation of the state’s relationship to security justifies militarism, which results in colonialist wars.

Barnett 2001, Fellow in the School of Social and Environmental Enquiry at University of Melbourne, 2001 (Jon, and a New Zealand Sci and Tech Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Canterbury and serves on the editorial boards of several scholarly journals, May 4, The Meaning of Environmental Security: Ecological Politics and Policy in the New Security Era, pg. 47 p3 – pg. 49 p1)

The most important critique of expanded conceptions...do not correspond to the needs of people.</headline></objectSummary></objects>
