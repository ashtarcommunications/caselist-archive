Overlapping regulations on OTEC create a confusing maze that hamstrings the industry preventing viability even though the technology is ready
Elefant 2002(Carolyn, Principle Attorney at LOCE, November 19, &amp;#34; Proposed Strategies for Addressing Regulatory Uncertainty in Ocean Energy Development in the United States &amp;#34;, http://www.energypulse.net/centers/article/article_display.cfm?a_id=79- )
The foregoing events suggest that presently,....a project can or will be licensed on favorable terms. 

PLAN: THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD REDUCE PRODUCTION RESTRICTIONS ON OCEAN THERMAL ENERGY CONVERSION IMPOSED BY ENTITIES OTHER THAN THE NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION AND INCENTIVIZE SOLAR ENERGY PRODUCTION USING OCEAN THERMAL ENERGY CONVERSION IN THE UNITED STATES 
Advantage One: Hurricanes 
Hurricanes are deadly

Heavy rainfall in upstream areas also washes soil, .... rescued and underwent rehabilitation.

We knew this already.  We learned from Katrina the dangers of not understanding the new cultural politics.  We must confront disposability 
Giroux in 6 &amp;#123;Henry A. Reading Hurricane Katrina: Race, Class, and the Biopolitics of Disposability College Literature - 33.3, Summer 2006, pp. 171-196 West Chester University} 

The tragedy and suffering in the aftermath .... and indifferent in the face human suffering and death.

Just as debaters move from one extinction scenario to another, the public loses connection with the most vulnerable. When a new crisis begins, we are engaged but the reaction dissipates and we move on.  Without a rupture, this process is inevitable. We’ve seen Sandy up close.  We refuse to move on. We won’t forget.

As with most natural disasters, ....everything, but they have no means to get it back. 

And a refusal to remember makes us complicit with the continuing extinction of the communities of the planet that make up this complex series of ecosystems.  Our appetites for energy production cause us to perceive the victimized as “resources.” It is a question of agency and appetites.

Those who are worried about the collapse .... our diamonds and coal. 

OTEC prevents hurricanes

Besides the potential for enhanced fish production, ....unexpected harmful effects were to occur.
Advantage Two: Scarcity
Water scarcity threatens 1.1 billion daily and kills 3 million annually. A child dies every 20 seconds.  Water is a precious and endangered resource. 
Cardoni in 12 &amp;#123;Salvatore-Care2 Causes Editors  March 22Access to Drinkable Water Shouldn’t Be an American “Pipe Dream” http://www.care2.com/causes/access-to-drinkable-water-shouldnt-be-an-american-pipe-dream.html}
There is no more fundamental natural resource to life, .... we will all regret our neglect .

Lack of drinking water comparatively outweighs war, terrorism and WMD use.

The World Health Organization says ....in water contaminated by the feces of sick individuals.

OTEC produces desalinated water—critical to prevent global water scarcity.

OTEC systems are not just limited to ....access to fresh water is scarce.
Observation Two: Solvency
Federal production tax credit is key to business investment in OTEC.

Executives said Monday that their intention ....to power the globe even if it’s only marginally successful.

Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) ....attractive alternative form of energy.


OTEC can ultimately produce infinite fresh water.

“Century of Water” has come. .... ocean thermal energy is plentiful and very stable. 
Water is the root cause of many problems and investment is key to solve.
