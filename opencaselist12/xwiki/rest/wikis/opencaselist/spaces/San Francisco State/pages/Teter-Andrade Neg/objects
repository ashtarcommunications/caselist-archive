Alt: The alternative is to reject the affirmative and endorse an Ecofeminist pedagogy. &#xD;
We must expose patriarchy and disconnect from concepts of “masculinity,” as that of “power over,” others and the rejections/denigration of the “feminine.” Our approach is key to solving for the comprehension of patriarchal culture. &#xD;

we remain in thrall to untamed survival instincts that could well end up destroying not just the entire species, but all life on the planet.

Every arrebato rips you from your familiar &amp;#34;home.” You question who you are, and what the world is about. The urgency to know what you&amp;#39;re experiencing awakens la facultad-the ability to shift and see through the surface of situations. With the loss of the familiar and unknown ahead, you struggle to regain balance, reintegrate yourself and repair the damage. Giving you a chance to reconstruct yourself, forcing you to rework your description of self, world and your place in it (reality).


Stage 2: Nepantla
Catapulted into nepantla you are in transitional space, suspended between shifts, two people, split between before and after. You experience reality as fluid. Exposed, open to other perspectives, more readily able to access knowledge derived from inner feelings, imaginal states, and outer events to &amp;#34;see through&amp;#34; human acts—individual and collective—to examine the ways you construct knowledge, identity, reality, and explore how your/other&amp;#39;s constructions violate other ways of knowing and living. 

Stage 3: the Coatlicue State
Overwhelmed by the chaos caused by living in Nepantla, you break down, descend into the third space, the Coatlicue depths of despair, self-loathing, and hopelessness. Dysfunctional for weeks, the refusal to move paralyzes you.

&amp;#34;resolved&amp;#34;
Michael, Shapiro. Professor at the University of Hawaii 1996 Challenging Boundaries by Shapiro and Akler, University of Minnesota Press, pg 53 wdc T. 

we should not base our decisions on whether or not the plan is less violent than the status quo because as long as we live in a colonial world those options are not innocent
Martin Hagglun 04 (phd candidate in compartive literature at Cornell University. The John Hopkins University Press, &amp;#34;The Necessity of Discrimination: Disjoining Derrida and Levinas&amp;#34; , pg 47-48)

Stage 4: Call to Action
 A call to action pulls you out of your depression, calling you to speak against and resist the despairs experienced in the Coatlicue state. You are thrust into action with the need to respond. 


Stage 5: Personal Tales of Growth  
Desire for order and meaning prompts you to sift, sort, and symbolize your experiences arranging them into a pattern and story speaking to your reality and creating a new narrative articulating your personal reality. You scrutinize and question dominant and ethnic and the mind-sets your cultures induce in others. Putting all the pieces together, you re-envision the map of the known world, creating a new description of reality and scripting a new story.

We need to give these ancient sources new nouns and new meanings.

Stage 6: The Blow up—clash of realities
You take your story out into the world, testing it. When you or the world fail to live up to your ideals, your edifice collapses casting you into conflict with self and others in a war between realities. 



Stage 7: Shifting Realities  
The critical turning point of transformation, you shift realities, develop an ethical, compassionate strategy with which to negotiate conflict and difference within self and between others, and find common ground by forming holistic alliances.
