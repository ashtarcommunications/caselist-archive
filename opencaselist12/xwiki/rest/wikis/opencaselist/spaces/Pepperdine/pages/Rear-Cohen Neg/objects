INTERPERTATION- The United States Federal Government is either the legislative, executive or judicial branch. The affirmative must specify this in the plan====
A Dictionary of Politics 1973 p 509
The structure of the federal government, and of most inferior governments, is based on the doctrine of Separation of Powers; membership in any of the three co-ordinate branches of government – legislative, executive, judicial – is incompatible with membership in the other. 

B. Violation: The Aff doesn~’t specify which branch of government is used in their plan.

C. Standards

____1. Ground:  Not specifying which branch destroys CP ground, agent DA~’s and perception arguments because they can switch their advocacy in the 2AC, making the plan conditional.

____ 2.  2AC Clarification is illegitimate:  We already lost ground, don~’t let them cover that up. It also makes them a moving target, since we don~’t know who enacts the plan. 1NC strategy is based only on the plan text, so it should be evaluated in a vacuum.

____ 3. Education: We increase topic specific education like actor indicts and implementation

         4. Encourages bad plan text writing – Non-specification creates vague plan texts that don~’t provide any neg link ground.  

D. ASPEC is a voter for the reasons above in the name of Fairness and predictability.

XO shields the president from politics – Congress will ensure this, particularly in the arena of energy production.
