Observation One: 
 The Cry of The Native American 
We were here first
(i-gv-ya o-gi-lu-tsv a-ha-ni)
Maybe the Cherokee cry
But we wanted their land
So they had to die
How could their rights
Have been explained?
The bow and arrow -
Against the gun ordained?
We took their homes -
(Do-ge-nv-sv do-ge-gi-gi-e-lv)
They were mostly dead - when the deeds were done
What was theirs is ours - Yes%21 we have won
They had to die - we had no choice
Their punishment for owning - our land first
The Indians had been the custodians of the land.
(a-ni-yv-wi-ya o-s-da i-yu-nv-na-de-ga ga-do-hi)
But the cowboy turned the pastures into sand
And buffalo herds - very soon were damned
Sustainability was more the Indians way
a-ni-yv-wi-ya u-nv-sv a-na-li-s-de-li-s-gv.
But luxury to excess was more our &amp;#34;cup of tea&amp;#34;
We brought the Indians smallpox, pollution and T.B.
After two Hundred years we now see our wrongs
And we begin to listen to the Indian Songs
na-quu-no a-nv-da-di-s-do-di-quu i-ga
di-ga-ka-no-gi-s-do-di a-le i-ga-da
da-ni-na-s-da-tli tsu-na-ni-gi-da.
But sadly most of their tribes are gone
Now in the souvenir shops throughout the U.S.A
Indian proverbs are on display
Pictures of Geronimo, Sitting Bull and Chief Joseph
Are sort by tourist looking for proverbs and Indian motifs
Sayings of American Presidents are not bought
But Chief Red Cloud of the Sioux is eagerly sought
Why do we see the wisdom - yet our ancestors couldn~’t?
Or is it that they could - but wouldn~’t
The American Indians say 
&amp;#34;There is one God looking down on us all&amp;#34;
(sa-quu u-ne-la-nv-hi)
Has the Native American salvation come at last
And will the &amp;#34;Great One&amp;#34; now be just.

====As a community, we have crafted a resolution that disproportionally affects a group of people who are under- represented in the debate community. This activity is about contesting marginalization and oppression; however we don~’t address the fact that the very land we stand on, the very land we debate about, while we argue back and forth about where to plant wind turbines and install solar panels…does not belong to us. We continue to use this stolen land for its resources, in the form of energy legislation that exploits Native Americans.====

====This resolution locks debaters into incentivizing energy production/ removing market barriers for energy production; thus serving as masks for the state, making it appear benevolent, even as its existence is contingent upon a continuing legacy of colonization that guarantees continued exploitation. ====

For the reasons above, we won~’t defend the instrumental adoption of energy production.

=Solar FiT~’s 1AC=


===Observation One – The Status Quo===


====The federal government is embracing solar as a viable form of energy production, but their plans for expansion are limited to 6 states and utility scale projects.====
**US Dept of Interior ~’12** ~~http://www.doi.gov/news/pressreleases/Obama-Administration-Approves-Roadmap-for-Utility-Scale-Solar-Energy-Development-on-Public-Lands.cfm~~

As part of President Obama~’s all-of-the-above energy strategy to 
AND
support 13,000 construction and operations jobs according to project developer estimates. 

====The Administration~’s recent decision to fast-track large-scale solar was a pivot point in our nation~’s relationship with solar energy – it was a matter of choice, and the United States Federal Government chose to fund programs that will increase the cost of electricity for the majority of rate payers while guaranteeing a boost in revenue for utilities. ====
**Union Bulletin ~’13** ~~1/3, Small-scale solar~’s big potential goes untapped, by Julie Cart,http://union-bulletin.com/news/2013/jan/03/small-scale-solars-big-potential-goes-untapped/~~

The Obama administration~’s solar-power initiative has fast-tracked large-scale plants
AND
also have brought solar power within reach for many homeowners and small businesses.

====These large scale programs, by their very nature, do no integrate into the most overlooked communities — that have been battered by their proximity to fossil fuel industries for decades, and are being excluded as beneficiaries of the solar movement.====
**Cervas ~’12**, Coordinator @ California Environmental Justice ~~Strela, 1/19, Solar for All,http://caleja.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/SmallScaleRDGfitProposal_FINALv4.pdf~~

Low-income, communities of color have shouldered the burden of living adjacent to 
AND
will give teeth to the concept of investing in communities most in need. 

====This problem is exacerbated by current incentive structures that allow the benefits of solar panels to be reaped by middle and upper class families and businesses while low-income families literally pay the price.====
**Cardwell ~’12**, Business Day reporter for The New York Times covering energy ~~6/4, Diane, Solar Panel Payments Set Off a Fairness Debate, New York Times,http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/05/business/solar-payments-set-off-a-fairness-debate.html?pagewanted=all~~

In California~’s sun-scorched Central Valley, the monthly electric bill can easily top 
AND
continue to encourage rooftop installations, while the utilities have generally been opposed. 


====Thus, we offer the following plan: The Unites States Federal government should implement a feed in tariffs system for solar projects with a project size cap of 500 kilowatts, a program cap of 375 megawatts by 2020 at a &amp;#34;regular annual pace&amp;#34; with a term minimum of 20 years.====


===Observation Two – Solvency ===


====A small-scale FiT structure will facilitate solar installation in low income communities.====
**Cervas ~’12**, Coordinator @ California Environmental Justice ~~Strela, 1/19, Solar for All,http://caleja.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/SmallScaleRDGfitProposal_FINALv4.pdf~~

1 – Feed-in Tariffs (FiTs) for small-scale projects: 
AND
innovation, education, etc. to local communities, especially underemployed communities.


====These small scale projects will revitalize low income communities and give people control over their energy future.====
**Cervas ~’12**, Coordinator @ California Environmental Justice ~~Strela, 1/19, Solar for All,http://caleja.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/SmallScaleRDGfitProposal_FINALv4.pdf~~

Low-income communities of color need renewable energy systems that are 1.5 MW or less. A small-scale feed-in tariff program for renewable distributed generation allows rooftop solar that can be sited in low income urban and rural communities. Small-scale projects create jobs, reduce energy bills, generate wealth, revitalize neighborhoods, and give people some control over their energy future. 



====Specifically, and empirically, small-scale feed-in-tariff systems cut utility bills in half. ====

====Evo Energy ~’11 **~~4/12,http://www.triplepundit.com/2012/04/solar-feed-tariffs-uk-clarification/~~====**

It has been a frantic few months in the short-lived life of the feed-in tariff, with rates cut in half 5
the tariff was designed to encourage the growth of micro-generation from renewable sources 
AND
would rise each year with inflation and was tax-free for homeowners. 


===Observation Three – Forced Out===


====The insanely high cost of energy forced upon low income communities by unequal access to solar strains their already limited budgets – forcing the choice between paying energy bills and every other necessary cost of living, including mortgages and rent.====
**Smith et. al. ~’07**, MD %26 MPH – Chairperson of Child Health Impact Assessment Working Group ~~Lauren A., April, Unhealthy Consequences: Energy Costs and Child Health,http://www.hiaguide.org/sites/default/files/ChildHIAofenergycostsandchildhealth.pdf~~

High energy costs place increased economic demands on low-income households with limited budgets
AND
suggest that their situation would be even more precarious without this important assistance. 


====Specifically, high utility bills in low income communities are a leading cause of individuals~’ %26 families~’ inability to maintain the habitability of their home.====
**Smith et. al. ~’07**, MD %26 MPH – Chairperson of Child Health Impact Assessment Working Group ~~Lauren A., April, Unhealthy Consequences: Energy Costs and Child Health,http://www.hiaguide.org/sites/default/files/ChildHIAofenergycostsandchildhealth.pdf~~

It is well documented that high energy costs can result in unpaid bills, leading 
AND
off moratorium period, families continue to accrue debt for their utility bills. 


====3.5 million people are on the brink of losing their home as we speak.====
**National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty ~’12**(4/16, &amp;#34;Law Center Launches &amp;#34;All-In to End Homelessness&amp;#34; Campaign&amp;#34;  http://homelessnesslaw.org/2012/04/law-center-launches-%E2%80%9Call-in-to-end-homelessness%E2%80%9D-campaign/-http://homelessnesslaw.org/2012/04/law-center-launches-%E2%80%9Call-in-to-end-homelessness%E2%80%9D-campaign/)

The &amp;#34;All-In&amp;#34; campaign commemorates the Act~’s 25th Anniversary – recognizing its 
AND
to act.  It~’s time to fulfill the promise of McKinney-Vento.


====Scenario 1 – Cycle of Trauma====


====The forced move from experiencing low-income housing to homelessness specifically pushes women into a spiraling crisis of ongoing sexual assault layered on top of constant struggle to meet basic survival needs. Women experiencing homelessness are trapped in a traumatic lifestyle of perpetual and repeated battering, including rape – they are confined to this violence by their own transience as all avenues for remedy require a fixed contact location and shelters are the breeding ground for the types of violence they are trying to flee. Addressing this transience is the only way to begin to address the impact of this trauma and to stop the cycle before it starts.====
**Goodman et.al. 11** ~~Lisa A. Goodman, Ph.D., Katya Fels, %26 Catherine Glenn, M.A. With contributions from Judy Benitez, No Safe Place: Sexual Assault in the Lives of Homeless Women~~

Although prevalence rates of homelessness have been estimated at up to seven to eight percent 
AND
creating a growing number of ìspecial needsî victims whose needs are grossly neglected.

====Women experiencing precarious housing situations are uniquely vulnerable to interpersonal violence – this demands our immediate attention.====
**Goodman et.al. 11** ~~Lisa A. Goodman, Ph.D., Katya Fels, %26 Catherine Glenn, M.A. With contributions from Judy Benitez, No Safe Place: Sexual Assault in the Lives of Homeless Women~~

Despite over two decades of media and public policy attention, homelessness remains an enormous 
AND
might take to intervene with victims and prevent future sexual assaults from occurring.



====Scenario 2 - Visibility====

====Loss of daily shelter forces people into absolute vulnerability and leads to unspeakable, inescapable violence against them - we must take steps to pull people out of this trap.====
**Norton ~’09** ~~Larry, 8/19, Dehumanizing the homeless: violence and hate, http://blog.oregonlive.com/oldtown/2009/08/dehumanizing_the_homeless_viol.html~~


====What is the effect of dehumanizing the homeless? Vulnerability. Previously (Part II) in commenting on the hate and violence against the homeless I suggested that there is an environment that dehumanizes the homeless and that it leaves them vulnerable. &amp;#34;Vulnerability, especially in the homeless situation, means that an attacker is likely feel that he or she can get away with it because the thought is that the &amp;#34;homeless people aren~’t important, that homeless people are nobodies.&amp;#34; ~~Orlando Sentinel~~. And, to make it even easier to get away with it is the fact that many of the attacks go unreported by the homeless; most likely because of the role the police play, i. e., enforcers of laws that are perceived as anti-homeless. From the NYT piece and the NCH Report as well as a Google search, it appears that many of the homeless that are being attacked are the chronic homeless who are the most vulnerable and would offer the least resistance. And, one has to recognize that it is unlikely that the attacks would occur against anyone but the very vulnerable. I would liken these attackers to those who would harm a cat or dog just for the thrill of it. Something is wrong with these attackers that even full employment or no homelessness would cure. These are predators that for a host of reasons seek out vulnerable people to harm. For a composite of the &amp;#34;who&amp;#34; and the &amp;#34;why&amp;#34;of ~’homeless~’ violence see the Oregonian~’s article about the twin brothers that were responsible for five incidents of attacks. E. g., in the article, Portland Detective Kevin Warren states that the twin brothers were &amp;#34;always picking on people who are older and frailer. There~’s no fair fights here. For the most part, it~’s just a beat-down. They~’re just beating people up because they~’re thinking they~’ll get away with it.&amp;#34; Given the vulnerability — who takes advantage of it? &amp;#34;The assailants are outsiders, mostly teenagers &amp;#34;who punch, kick, shoot or set afire people living on the streets, frequently killing them, simply for the sport of it, their victims all but invisible to society.&amp;#34; ~~NYT~~. The &amp;#34;National Coalition for the Homeless . . . says in its new report that 58 percent of assailants implicated in attacks against the homeless in the last 10 years were teenagers ~~13 to 19~~.&amp;#34; ~~NYT, NCH Report ~~. But take a look at the NCH Report graph page 20. These are young assailants. 78% of them were 25 and younger. Of the 58%, 24% were 18 %26 19 years old with 24% being 13 -19. Portland~’s Precinct Commander Reese in an Oregonian opinion would seem to agree when he identifies one group of offenders responsible for downtown problems: They are transient &amp;#34;young adults between 18 and 30 years of age. They~’re the ones engaged in aggressive panhandling and intimidating behavior in downtown. ~~....~~ Most are addicted to heroin or alcohol.&amp;#34; &amp;#34;They have made a lifestyle choice to live on the streets, and they consistently refuse housing, treatment or other services.&amp;#34; Why do they do it? &amp;#34;A lot are thrill seekers,&amp;#34; a quote by Brian Levin, a criminologist who runs the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino. ~~NYT~~. From another New York Times article pointing to youths as mostly to blame: &amp;#34;He ~~15 years old~~ does not know why. He was high, does not remember much and wants to forget the rest.&amp;#34; And questioning motives in another incident: &amp;#34;What could possibly be in the mind of a 10- or 12-year -old that would possess them to pick up a rock and pick up a brick and beat another human being in the head?&amp;#34; But, in the NYT, a Texas State Representative sees it as a status issue: &amp;#34;More and more, we~’re hearing about homeless people being attacked for no other reason than that they~’re homeless . . .&amp;#34; Frankly I don~’t buy that. It is an illogical proposition to attribute violence towards an individual or similarly situated persons merely because he or she is homeless. It is a blame the victim approach. These crimes, and they are that, are not akin to racial or sexual orientation discrimination. It is the vulnerability of those being attacked — isn~’t it? Without belaboring this too much, the ~’hate~’ is not hate of the homeless — it is a sociopathic attack on the vulnerable. Attacking a vulnerable person, e. g., homeless, means that because the &amp;#34;homeless people aren~’t important, that homeless people are nobodies&amp;#34; he or she feels they can get away with it. ~~See Orlando Sentinel~~. And, to make it even easier to get away with it is the fact that many of the attacks go unreported by the homeless; most likely because of the role the police play, i. e., enforcers of laws that are perceived as anti-homeless. From the NYT piece, the NCH Report , and a Google search, it appears that many of the homeless that are being attacked are the chronic homeless who are the most vulnerable and would offer the least resistance. And, one has to recognize that it is unlikely that the attacks would occur against anyone but the very vulnerable. I would liken these attackers to those who would harm a cat or dog just for the thrill of it. Something is wrong with them that even full employment or no homelessness would cure. These are predators that for a host of reasons seek out vulnerable people to harm. For a composite of the &amp;#34;who&amp;#34; and the &amp;#34;why&amp;#34;of ~’homeless~’ violence see the Oregonian~’s article about the twin brothers that were responsible for five incidents of attacks. The NYT points to ~’bum movies~’ and articles like the one found in Maxim - &amp;#34;Hunt the Homeless&amp;#34; as examples of encouraging attacks on the homeless. Attacks by young adults and teenagers on vulnerable people because they can get away with attacks on nobodies will not be stopped by continuing to blame the victim. As noted, physical attacks are not a known problem in Portland, verbal attacks are heard on the streets and read all too often in the local media. But can physical attacks be far behind? Aren~’t the means to resolve the violence readily available and easy to implement? 1st is to separate out the criminal element from the homeless category. This is important so that there is a clear definition of homeless — they are not criminals. Being poor, being without a job is not a criminal offense. 2nd is to implement social, not criminal, solutions to homelessness. Criminalization of unintended conduct is anti-democratic and certainly doesn~’t fit the liberal image of Portland. Social solutions get to the root of the problem, criminal solutions begat criminals. 3rd is to arrest, prosecute and appropriately sentence those culprits who would attack the homeless. This will send a deterrent message to the attackers and a relief message to the many homeless victims. Well so much for day dreams.====

====People experiencing homelessness, even as they are brutalized are literally invisible in our society – our 1ac is an attempt to bring them back into our collective field of vision. Simple recognition is the first step.====
**Jean ~’10 **(Abby, August 5, 2010, &amp;#34;Vulnerability: Indexes, Homelessness and Disability&amp;#34; http://disabledfeminists.com/2010/08/05/vulnerability-indexes-homelessness-and-disability/)

This population is considered extremely difficult to serve, as lots have tried to engage 
AND
that – and these programs are proving that assumption to be absolutely wrong.

====The US has obligated itself to take the lead in NEO defense.====
KOPLOW ~~~’05 **~~~~~~JUSTIN L., J.D., Georgetown University Law Center, Georgetown International Environmental Law Review, Winter 2005, 17 Geo. Int~~~’l Envtl. L. Rev. 273; Lexis~~~~~~**

The fundamental procedures of intercepting an incoming missile and diverting an asteroid are significantly different
AND
are being denied normal means and opportunities for self-defense and protection. 



====Believe it or not, IT~~~’S TRUE%21 NASA is still committed to nuclear deflection.====

====NASA Official Mike Green 2/16/13 **~~~~~~Editor: Tricia Talbert (Page, February 16, ) Updated: , 2013 ====**
**NASA Official: Mike Green, Optimal Dispersion of Near-Earth Objects,http://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/niac/wie_optimal_dispersion.html~~~~~~**

Despite the lack of a known immediate threat from a near-Earth object (
AND
in relative closing velocities as high as 5-30 km/s. 


====The problem is that nukes won~~~’t work. Multiple uncertainties make nuclear weapons a bad option for deflection.====

====Schweickart ~~~’04 **~~~~~~Russell L., Chair, B612 Foundation, &amp;#34;Asteroid Deflection; Hopes and Fears,&amp;#34; ~~~~www.b612foundation.org/papers/Asteroid_Deflection.doc-http://www.b612foundation.org/papers/Asteroid_Deflection.doc~~~~~~~~~~====**

In both these cases the characteristics of the specific asteroid are clearly critical.  In 
AND
asteroids lead many proponents of deflection to remain skeptical about the nuclear options.


====Nuclear deflection will fail…the warheads will explode on earth.====

There is a persistent notion in lay circles that the way to deal with a dangerous NEO is to
simply hit it with an ICBM and vaporize it in space. Unfortunately, reality 
AND
current technology upper stages, is highly undesirable if not essentially ruled out.

 

====Using a nuclear weapon fragments the asteroid:  increasing the overall threat.====

====Schweickart ~~~’04 **~~~~~~Russell L., Chair, B612 Foundation, &amp;#34;Asteroid Deflection; Hopes and Fears,&amp;#34; ~~~~www.b612foundation.org/papers/Asteroid_Deflection.doc-http://www.b612foundation.org/papers/Asteroid_Deflection.doc~~~~~~~~~~====**

The hard options consist of various forms of nuclear explosion as well as that of 
AND
it is highly dependent on the structural character of the asteroid in question.  


 


====Plan: The United States Federal Government should substantially increase grants for solar sail energy research and development in the United States. ====


 

====Observation 3:  Sailvency====


====Nuclear weapons should be considered a means of last resort—98% of asteroids can be deflected with non-nuclear means.====

====Klaes ~~~’07 **~~~~~~Larry, 3/21/20, staff writer, ~~~~http://seti.sentry.net/archive/bioastro/2007/Mar/0159.html-http://seti.sentry.net/archive/bioastro/2007/Mar/0159.html~~~~~~~~~~====**

In contrast, Schweickart argues that the so-called &amp;#34;nuclear standoff&amp;#34; option should be used only as a last resort. He contends that 98 percent of the potential threats can be mitigated by using less extreme measures. For example, he favors the development of a &amp;#34;gravity tractor&amp;#34; - a spacecraft that would
Hover near an asteroid for years at a time, using subtle gravitational attraction to draw the space rock out of a worrisome path.  To kick it up a notch, Schweickart said a threatening NEO could first be hit
with a kinetic impactor - say, a scaled-up version of the Deep Impact bullet that hit Comet Tempel 1 back in 2005 - and then the orbital track could be fine-tuned using the tractor. Navigational sensors aboard the tractor would check to make sure the NEO was on a completely safe path.  &amp;#34;This combination is obviously the way to go,&amp;#34; he said.

 

====Nuclear weapon deflection fails—softer forms of deflection are superior.  ====

====
But it is becoming clear that a longtime assumption of many scientists and 
AND
asteroid~~~’s orbit enough to change a hit into a close call.====


====Investment in solar sails makes it an immediately feasible option.====

Taking solar sail propulsion technology from ground testing to flight validation and mission implementation is 
AND
applications, is highly recommended as an outcome of the 2010 Decadal Survey. 


====International norms and laws will force US abandonment of nuclear option once solar sails are viable.====

====Atkinson ~~~’11, Universe Today **~~~~~~Nancy, Every way devised to deflect an asteroid,http://phys.org/news/2011-11-deflect-asteroid.html~~~~~~====**

Every Hollywood story dealing with asteroids always involves packing nuclear warheads on board a spaceship 
AND
would serve as a propulsion system to alter the trajectory of the NEO.


====U.S. leadership is essential to effective planetary defense – everyone will follow.====

====Dinerman ~~~’09 **~~~~~~Taylor, staff writer, ~~~~http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1418/1-http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1418/1~~~~~~~~~~====**

Yet in the end, it is likely that the decision, if there is 
AND
&amp;#34;global governance&amp;#34; could end up setting the stage for a disaster.



====Solar sails will shift asteroids away from Earth.====

====Plan: The United States Federal Government should substantially increase grants for magnetic fusion energy generation in the United States. ====

===Observation One – The Imminent Attack===


====Recent budget cuts undermine the spillover effects of fusion research.====
Cunningham ~’12 ~~Nicholas, Policy Analyst for Energy and Climate – American Security Project, &amp;#34;The Future of Fusion&amp;#34;, American Security Project Blog, 6-5, http://americansecurityproject.org/blog/2012/the-future-of-fusion/-http://americansecurityproject.org/blog/2012/the-future-of-fusion/~~

Fourth, a robust fusion industry would have important spillover effects that previous technological breakthroughs 
AND
as China, South Korea and Japan increase their investments in fusion technology. 


====Overall funding increases are key to reversing this.====
Holland ~’12  ~~Andrew, Senior Fellow for Energy and Climate – American Security Project, &amp;#34;A Tough Budget for Fusion&amp;#34;, American Security Project Blog, 3-1, http://americansecurityproject.org/blog/2012/the-budget-for-fusion/~~ 

The cut in the domestic fusion program would have a devastating impact on U.
AND
be able to capitalize on the advancements in fusion science that will come. 


====Even if sustained fusion is far off, the spillover effects happen immediately.====
Silverstein ~’12 ~~Ken, Editor of Energy Central and Contributor – Forbes, &amp;#34;The Tantalizing Promise And Peril Of Nuclear Fusion&amp;#34;, Forbes Magazine, 4-15, http://www.forbes.com/sites/kensilverstein/2012/04/15/nuclears-strongest-potential-weapon-fusion/-http://www.forbes.com/sites/kensilverstein/2012/04/15/nuclears-strongest-potential-weapon-fusion/~~

&amp;#34;Despite fusion~’s tantalizing benefits, it has been largely ignored in energy policy discussions 
AND
in the future, as it does with any high-level research. 



====Fusion spin-off tech solves escalating threats to grid reliability and imminent blackouts.====
CCAS ~’09 ~~Coalition for the Commercial Application of Superconductors, &amp;#34;Superconductivity: Present and Future Applications&amp;#34;, http://www.ccas-web.org/pdf/ccas_brochure_web.pdf-http://www.ccas-web.org/pdf/ccas_brochure_web.pdf~~

The US Power Grid Under Stress Power industry experts in the United States are widely 
AND
power flows and policy reforms that threaten the power industry and our overall economy 


====Blackouts causes meltdowns — outweighs nuclear war.====
Goldes ~’11 ~~MA @ Brandeis and San Francisco State, Mark Goldes Former Research Fellow at Brandeis University is Founder of the Aesop Institute. Formerly Senior Director of the Berlin Corridor control radar in Germanyfor US Air Force SOLAR MEGASTORMS can GENERATE a GLOBAL NUCLEAR NIGHTMARE http://www.opednews.com/articles/SOLAR-MEGASTORMS-can-GENER-by-Mark-Goldes-111119-448.html-http://www.opednews.com/articles/SOLAR-MEGASTORMS-can-GENER-by-Mark-Goldes-111119-448.html~~

We face a severe potential emergency. External threats serve to unite. The world 
AND
have adequately prepared to prevent the horrendous effects of such a solar megastorm. 


====A solar megastorm that causes widespread meltdowns of numerous nuclear power plants will kill millions, if not hundreds of millions, or even billions, of lives from radioactivity. ====
Hecht ~’11 ~~Editor in Chief @ 21st Century Magazine Laurence, Solar Storm Threatening Power Grids – Yet no Action Taken to Implement Defences, http://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Solar-Storm-Threatening-Power-Grids-%E2%80%93-Yet-no-Action-Taken-to-Implement-Defences.html-http://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Solar-Storm-Threatening-Power-Grids-%E2%80%93-Yet-no-Action-Taken-to-Implement-Defences.html~~

A prolonged lack of electricity in any of these areas would reduce the population to 
AND
unprepared for a return to pre-electricity conditions could descend into chaos. 


====This obviously causes extinction.====
Lugar ~’04 ~~Richard G., U.S. Senator – Indiana and Former Chair – Senate Foreign Relations Committee, &amp;#34;Plant Power&amp;#34;, Our Planet, 14(3), http://www.unep.org/ourplanet/imgversn/143/lugar.html-http://www.unep.org/ourplanet/imgversn/143/lugar.html~~

In a world confronted by global terrorism, turmoil in the Middle East, burgeoning 
AND
in the survival of billions of people and the health of our planet. 


====The ~~%231 spinoff will occur in optics.====
Pomeroy ~’12 ~~Ross, Assistant Editor – RealClearScience, &amp;#34;Fusion: The Energy of Tomorrow, Today&amp;#34;, Real Clear Science, 6-21, http://www.realclearscience.com/articles/2012/06/21/fusion_the_energy_of_tomorrow_today_10- 6303.html-http://www.realclearscience.com/articles/2012/06/21/fusion_the_energy_of_tomorrow_today_10- 6303.html~~

It~’s high time that politicians, and indeed all Americans, recognize that a new 
AND
will drive innovation in multitudes of fields ranging from optics to materials science. 



====Optics are key to next-generation Internet technologies.====
ITU ~’11 ~~United Nations International Telecommunication Union, &amp;#34;The Optical World,&amp;#34; June 2011, http://www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu-t/oth/23/01/T23010000130001PDFE.pdf-http://www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu-t/oth/23/01/T23010000130001PDFE.pdf~~

II. Why optical technology? Optical technology is viewed by industry experts as the 
AND
will continue to be a strategic enabler for next-generation Internet services. 


====Next generation net key to solve disease spread and bioterrorism.====
Mackenzie ~’03 ~~John and Peter Yellowlees, Professors of Microbiology and Parasitology – University of Queensland, &amp;#34;Telehealth Responses to Bio-Terrorism and Emerging Infections&amp;#34;, Journal of Telemedicine and Telecare, 9(Suppl. 2), p. 80-81~~
 
Emerging infectious diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), are of 
AND
, although a number of commercial products are in the process of development. 


====In the event of CBW, retaliation causes nuclear war.====
Conley ~’03 ~~Lieutenant Colonel Harry W., Chief of the System Analysis Branch – Headquarters Air Combat Command, &amp;#34;Not with Impunity: Assessing US Policy for Retaliating to a Chemical or Biological Attack&amp;#34;, Air %26 Space Power Journal, Spring, http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/apj/apj03/spr03/conley.html-http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/apj/apj03/spr03/conley.html~~

The number of American casualties suffered due to a WMD attack may well be the 
AND
be more than just a possibility, whatever promises had been made.&amp;#34;48 



====And the attack is likely this year.====
Glassman ~’12 ~~James K., founding executive director of the George W. Bush Institute and former president of the Atlantic Monthly magazine, publisher of the New Republic magazine, executive vice president of U.S. News %26 World Report, and editor and co-owner of Roll Call, the Congressional newspaper, &amp;#34;We~’re Letting Our Bioterrorism Defenses Down,&amp;#34; 4-4-12, http://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesglassman/2012/04/04/were-letting-our-bioterrorism-defenses-down/-http://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesglassman/2012/04/04/were-letting-our-bioterrorism-defenses-down/-http://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesglassman/2012/04/04/were-letting-our-bioterrorism-defenses-down/-http://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesglassman/2012/04/04/were-letting-our-bioterrorism-defenses-down/~~

A little over three years ago, a commission of experts, established by Congress
AND
the relative ease of making a bioweapon and the relative difficulty of defending.&amp;#34; 


===Observation Two – C-Mod===

====Alcator C-Mod will close without federal fusion funding.====
Lin ~’12 ~~Leon, writer for The Tech at MIT, &amp;#34;Alcator C-Mod may lose funds,&amp;#34; http://tech.mit.edu/V132/N35/alcator.html~~

President Obama~’s budget request to Congress for fiscal year (FY) 2013, 
AND
the domestic fusion program will be effectively eliminated to pay for ITER.&amp;#34; 


====Only consistent federal funding stops the DOE from closing C-Mod.====
Cadwallader ~’12 ~~Lee, Chair of the Fusion Energy Division at the American Nuclear Society, &amp;#34;ANS Fusion Energy Division statement on FY2013 energy appropriations,&amp;#34; 4-18-12, http://ansnuclearcafe.org/2012/04/18/ans-fusion-energy-division-statement-on-fy2013-energy-appropriations/~~ 

The FY-2013 budget request by the Administration endangers the United States~’ domestic fusion 
AND
budget and, separately, fully funding this nation~’s promised annual ITER contribution. 


====Federal funding now is key to sustain C-Mod in future budgets.====
Holland ~’12 ~~Andrew, American Security Project~’s Senior Fellow for Energy and Climate, &amp;#34;A Tough Budget for Fusion,&amp;#34; 3-1-12, http://americansecurityproject.org/blog/2012/the-budget-for-fusion/-http://americansecurityproject.org/blog/2012/the-budget-for-fusion/http://americansecurityproject.org/blog/2012/the-budget-for-fusion/~~

The details of the FY13 fusion budget are these: The budget requests %24398
AND
, www.fusionfuture.org that details the importance of this budget. 


====C-Mod is vital for research in quantum mechanics.====
Rice ~’11 ~~John, Unexpected connection: Rotation reversal tied to energy confinement saturation, November 11, 2011,http://phys.org/news/2011-11-unexpected-rotation-reversal-tied-energy.html~~

Research on the Alcator C-Mod experiment at MIT has made an unexpected connection 
AND
. Evidence for this explanation is emerging from careful measurements of plasma fluctuations. 


====This is key to quantum computing and that prevents loss of military computer security.====
Aaronson ~’08 ~~Scott, Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT, &amp;#34;Quantum Computing and the Ultimate Limits of Computation: The Case for a National Investment,&amp;#34; 12-12-08, http://www.cra.org/ccc/docs/init/Quantum_Computing.pdf-http://www.cra.org/ccc/docs/init/Quantum_Computing.pdf~~

For the last fifty years computers have grown faster, smaller, and more powerful 
AND
into understanding how to build codes which are not breakable by quantum computers. 


====The impact is nuclear war.====
Blair ~’10 ~~Bruce, President of the World Security Institute and Co-coordinator of Global Zero, &amp;#34;Could Terrorists Launch America~’s Nuclear Missiles?&amp;#34; 11-11-10, http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2030685,00.html-http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2030685,00.html~~

The communications and computer networks used to control nuclear forces are supposed to be firewalled 
AND
, rather than less, vulnerable to the threats of the 21st century. 


====C-Mod closure cements Chinese fusion leadership.====
Vastag ~’12 ~~Brian, science reporter at The Washington Post, &amp;#34;Budget cuts threaten pursuit of nuclear fusion as a clean energy source,&amp;#34; 6-25-12, http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/budget-cuts-threaten-pursuit-of-nuclear-fusion-as-a-clean-energy-source/2012/06/25/gJQAKlpS2V_story.html-http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/budget-cuts-threaten-pursuit-of-nuclear-fusion-as-a-clean-energy-source/2012/06/25/gJQAKlpS2V_story.html~~

President Obama~’s budget request for next year cuts domestic fusion research by 16 percent, 
AND
for 60 years of research; we~’ll take it from here.~’ &amp;#34; 


====Chinese fusion leadership causes weaponization.====
Zhao ~’09 ~~Yan, writer for the China Military Report, &amp;#34;SHOCKED%21 CHINA~’S FOURTH GENERATION OF NUCLEAR EXPOSURE,&amp;#34; http://wuxinghongqi.blogspot.com/2009/10/shocked-chinas-fourth-generation-of.html~~ 

More advanced and clean, the fourth-generation nuclear weapons are: the fusion 
AND
to compete for third in the world, fusion bombs in no different. 


====Chinese modernization shatters the nuclear firebreak.====
Makhijani ~’98 ~~Arjun, President – Institute for Energy and Environmental Research, &amp;#34;Statement Before the National Press Club&amp;#34;, 7-15, http://ieer.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/1998/07/dtq-statement-arjun.pdf-http://ieer.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/1998/07/dtq-statement-arjun.pdf~~

We must prevent these new highly dangerous and destructive nuclear weapons from being developed. 
AND
because of their smaller individual size and relative lack of fall-out. 


====Causes extinction.====
Anderson ~’06  ~~Philip W. Anderson, Joseph Henry Professor of Physics, Princeton University, et al, 2006, Nuclear Option Off the Table, http://physics.ucsd.edu /petition/DCflyer.pdf~~

It notes that there are no sharp lines between small and large nuclear weapons, 
AND
we urge the American people to make their voices heard on this matter.&amp;#34; 
 


===Observation Three — Leadership===

====Fusion is the litmus test for overall U.S. energy leadership====
Prager ~’11 ~~Stewart, Director – Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory and Professor of Astrophysical Sciences –  Princeton University, &amp;#34;How Seawater Can Power the World&amp;#34;, New York Times, 7-10, http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/11/opinion/11Prager.html?_r=1%26ref=opinion-http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/11/opinion/11Prager.html?_r=1%26ref=opinion~~

DEBATE about America~’s energy supply is heating up: gas prices are rising, ethanol 
AND
that will shape our future. Scientists and engineers stand ready to help. 


====And, federal funding is, and will continue to be, the focal point.====
Sarewitz ~’03 ~~Daniel, Professor of Science and Society and Co-Director of the Consortium for Science, Policy and Outcomes – Arizona State University, &amp;#34;Does Science Policy Exist, and If So, Does it Matter?: Some Observations on the U.S. R%26D Budget&amp;#34;, Discussion Paper for Earth Institute Science, Technology, and Global Development Seminar, 4-8, http://www.cspo.org/documents/budget_seminar.pdf-http://www.cspo.org/documents/budget_seminar.pdf~~

It is not only axiomatic but also true that federal science policy is largely played 
AND
be said is that it depends on which trends one chooses to examine. 



====Leads to extinction.====
Hagel ~’12 ~~Charles, Distinguished Professor in the Practice of National Governance – Georgetown University, &amp;#34;The Challenge of Change&amp;#34;, The Atlanticist, 5-15, http://www.acus.org/new_atlanticist/challenge-change-http://www.acus.org/new_atlanticist/challenge-change~~
 
The world we face in 2012 is of a different character than even a few 
AND
that frames the complexity of the challenges that face America and the world.
