Our interpretation 
The aff must defend a topical plan under this year~’s resolution. The colon indicates that the USFG is the agent of the resolution.
 Webster~’s ~’00 ~~Guide to Grammar and Writing, http://ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/marks/colon.htm~~
 
Use a colon ~~ : ~~ before a list or an explanation that is preceded 
AND
colon. The advice given above is consistent with the Gregg Reference Manual. 

And, &amp;#34;Resolved&amp;#34; means taking a specific courses of action.
American Heritage Dictionary ~’06 ~~American Heritage Dictionary, http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/resolved~~

INTRANSITIVE VERB:1. To reach a decision or make a determination: resolve on a course of action. 2. To  become separated or reduced to constituents. 3. Music To undergo resolution.   

We believe the best for of debate is a competing dialogue – the creation of a &amp;#34;counterword&amp;#34; in direct response to a &amp;#34;word&amp;#34; is necessary for real understanding.
Bahktin~’90 ~~Russian philopher and novelist, quoted in 1990, ed. Biz/ell %26 Herzberg, The Rhetorical Tradition, pg. 944~~

We have already had occasion to speak of the philological type of passive understanding, 
AND
the current of verbal intercourse endows a word with the light of meaning.

B. The Violation
1. Their action is not federal government action.
Black~’s Law Dictionary ~’99 ~~Dictionary, Seventh Edition, p.703~~

A national government that exercises some degree of control over smaller political units that have surrendered some degree of power in exchange for the right to participate in national political matters.

2.  They don~’t respond to the respond to the resolution with a specific course of action.
3. They disrupt fairness norms - 
A) Predictable ground is different and more important than ground: predictable ground can only come from the resolution because it is the only stable pre-tournament director of research—the fact that there is &amp;#34;neg&amp;#34; to their aff doesn~’t mean we could have anticipated and adequately researched all those ideas to compete fairly.
B) They decimate level playing field: We may have some options but not the generic ground the negative is entitled to via fairness norms and the aff obligation to provide us a place at the table. It~’s like inviting us to play football but we are the only ones expected to play without a ball – sure, we can play, but we can never score.
C) Breadth is worse than depth – having a lopsided debate about strategy is not as good as a debate on the central questions of the resolution.
D) Crushes topic specific education – one of the things we get out of the debate is the ability to flesh out ideas on a given topic over the course of the year – they deny us of this awesome opportunity by redirecting the conversation.
E) If they argue that the educational value of their arguments outweigh fairness, they are putting the cart before the horse – saying education outweighs fairness begs the questions of whether you provide productive education and the only way to judge this if the neg has the ability to predictably research answers to your arguments.
C. Impacts and reasons to vote
1.  Fairness norms are critical to fostering an effective dialogic—abandoning them undermines diversity
Muir ~’93 ~~Star Muir, prof. of speech communication @ George Mason University, 1993. (Philosophy %26 Rhetoric, vol. 26; pg. 290-291~~ 

A final point about relativism is that switch-side debate encourages fairness and equality 
AND
knowledge of alternative views and the concomitant strength of a reasoned moral conviction.
2.  Dialogic role-playing is key to developing tolerance %26 empathy—alternative pedagogies risk egocentrism and intolerance.
Muir ~’93 ~~Department of Communication, George Mason University, 93 ~~Star, Philosophy %26 Rhetoric, 26.4~~

The first response to the charge of relativism is that switch-side debate respects 
AND
reasons, is a central element of any effort to gain such insight.

3.  Oppositional discourses stop otherization and genocide- turns the case.
Ehringer ~’70 ~~Douglas Ehninger, prof. of speech communication at the University of Iowa, 1970, (Speech Monographs, vol. 37; 110)~~

But this process also is reflexive, for insofar as we treat the &amp;#34;other

====Reasons to prefer and vote neg====
1.	Precision – using precise terms is key to understanding and coalition building. We can never know where they are coming from if we do not know what they are saying to begin with. Their plan text uses a number of acronyms which are not explained. Additionally, &amp;#34;negotiates&amp;#34; was misspelled in the plan text, how are we supposed to know what they mean?
2.	Better plan writing – it~’s more than half way through the year. They should at least know how to copy and paste the resolution – key to educating us to exist as effective advocates in the real world. Example – we can~’t protest &amp;#34;Wall Coal&amp;#34; instead of &amp;#34;Wall Street&amp;#34; and create effective change. The plan text is the only thing we can stick them to in the round.
3.	Fairness – if they are going to read a version of &amp;#34;whole rez&amp;#34; it at least needs to be something stable enough for us to generate offense. Given the nature of the aff, this is particularly important.

the welfare of thousands who are engaged in the hazardous occupation of mining.



====This is the best interpretation.====

====Limits – There are a huge number of past instances where the federal government or individuals have interacted with energy policy– each of these is wildly unpredictable for the negative. AND, the abuse of unlimited topics is magnified when debating the past since we can~’t have generics – every case occurs in a different timeframe which means our arguments have to be written to dozens of different contexts. ====


====Ground – Consensus is generally settled on historical questions which means they will ALWAYS outweigh====
 


====Education – Debate trains us to be policy makers, lawyers and activists. All of these require the ability to make COST-BENEFIT CALCULATIONS relying on PREDICTIVE INFORMATION to be effective. This is a skill that can only and best be taught in policy debates using the assumptions of fiat. If history is valuable and relevant it can be used as empirical examples to prove and disprove future arguments which solves all your education claims====


====This is a voter for fairness, education, and ground.====


====We abandon this year~’s resolution, go back to April 28^^th^^, 2012 and have the CEDA Executive Committee remove the energy topic paper from consideration.====

====This solves the entirety of the affirmative because we are no longer masking the problem of energy itself and the way it functions. We no longer participate in the construction of this &amp;#34;false problem&amp;#34; as per the 1ac evidence. ====



====Our approach is a better pedagogical approach; counterfactual thinking makes people more motivated and analytical – means we can approach topic construction better.====

====Contention One: Competition – the counterplan excludes all of the text in the advocacy. ====


====Contention Two: The Net Benefit====

Reliance upon the phonetic alphabet destabilizes the balance of human mental evolution, creating a destructive trend toward masculine values that subliminally reprograms the user.

====SHLAIN, 1998====
Dr. Leonard Shlain is a neurosurgeon at California-Pacific Medical Center and contributor to The Encyclopedia of Creativity, The Alphabet Versus The Goddess: The Conflict Between Word and Image, 1998, pg. 66-8
Aside from the obvious benefits that derived from their ease of use, alpha¬bets produced 
AND
sexes were inexorably brought to heel by the left brain within each individual.

Left-brain rational functions denigrate natural relationships, risking planetary extinction. Only re-balancing our mental spheres can revitalize connections to the earth.

====Reuther, 1989====
Rosemary Radford, Professor of Feminist Theology at Pacific School of Religion, &amp;#34;Toward an Ecological-Feminist Theology of Nature&amp;#34; in Healing the Wounds: the Promise of Ecofeminism ed. Judith Plant p. 147-150
Thus we have not so much the privilege of intelligence, viewed as something above 
AND
nonhuman nature become friends in the creating of a livable and sustainable cosmos. 


====IMAGINING AND PRIVILEGING THE COUNTERPLAN THROUGH IMAGES CUTS THROUGH LEFT BRAIN DOMINANCE AND ENABLES A FULLY INTEGRATED PSYCHE. ====

====SHLAIN, 1998====
Dr. Leonard, neurosurgeon at California-Pacific Medical Center and contributor to The Encyclopedia of Creativity, The Alphabet Versus The Goddess: The Conflict Between Word and Image, 1998, pg. 4-5
To observe an enthralled four-year-old mastering the letters of the alphabet is to witness the beginning of a lifelong method central to the acquisition of knowledge. Literacy, once firmly rooted, will eclipse and supplant speech as the principal source of culture changing information. Adults, for so long enmeshed in the alphabet~’s visual skein, cannot easily disentangle themselves to assess its effect on culture. One could safely assume that fish have not yet discovered water.
Imagine that you came of age in a non-literate culture and were unaware of the impact the written word could have on your life. Suppose that as an adult you then found yourself in a literate society confronted by others who seemed to possess magical powers. Your reaction probably would not differ much from that of Prince Modupe, a young West African who, in his autobiography, related his encounter with the written word:
The one crowded space in Father Perry~’s house was his bookshelves. I gradually came 
AND
intensity of my desire to learn to do this wondrous thing myself.6
The prince could not know that in his attempt to free the doomboo, the pit itself would trap him in an unforeseen way: written words and images are entirely different &amp;#34;creatures.&amp;#34; Each calls forth a complementary but oppos¬ing perceptual strategy.
Images are primarily mental reproductions of the sensual world of vision. Nature and human artifacts both provide the raw material from the outside that the brain replicates in the inner sanctum of consciousness. Because of their close connection to the world of appearances, images approximate reality: they are concrete. The brain simultaneously perceives all parts of the whole integrating the parts synthetically into a gestalt. The majority of images are perceived in an all-at-once manner.
Reading words is a different process. When the eye scans distinctive individual letters arranged 
AND
of writ¬ten words emerges in a one-at-a-time fashion

====Understanding how our rhetoric affects the way we make policy is a prerequisite to the policy itself, otherwise they are will be doomed to fail.====

====Reasons to prefer and vote neg====
1.	Precision – using precise terms is key to understanding and coalition building. We can never know where they are coming from if we do not know what they are saying to begin with. Their 1AC switches between using the terms &amp;#34;Native American,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Indigenous,&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Indian&amp;#34; throughout the evidence and tags. Prefer our definitions which show that these terms can refer to completely different groups of people.
2.	Better plan writing – it~’s more than half way through the year. They should at least know how to copy and paste the resolution – key to educating us to exist as effective advocates in the real world. Example – we can~’t protest &amp;#34;Wall Coal&amp;#34; instead of &amp;#34;Wall Street&amp;#34; and create effective change. They should be able to justify all of their case in a coherent way.
3.	Fairness – The aff needs to stick to a stable advocacy in order for us to be able to generate offense on their positions. Otherwise, they can claim advantages which have nothing to do with the implementation of the plan.

====Communication-based misunderstanding leads to deadly disasters.====
