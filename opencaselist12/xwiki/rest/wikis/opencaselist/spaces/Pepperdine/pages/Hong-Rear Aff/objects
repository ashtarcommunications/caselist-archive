====Observation 1:  immanency====


Statistically likely that Earth will be hit with another large asteroid soon.

The close fly-by of an asteroid like DA14, like the Tunguska meteor
AND
thought — it ought to have happened about 12,000 times already. 



====The impact is billions of deaths.====

I. Introduction 694 was the year when a man envisioned a bone chilling scenario 
AND
scale would result in deaths and displacement of billions, if not more. 
 


====Kilometer wide asteroids could create a nuclear winter—causing extinction.====

====Blackwell~’02 **~~Tom, 8/29/20, National Post, Lexis~~====**
Asteroids a kilometre-wide could cause catastrophic damage and create years of nuclear winter for a continent. Giant, 10-kilometre-wide rocks, like one that wiped out the dinosaurs 65 million years ago, would &amp;#34;sterilize&amp;#34; the planet, said Mr. Balam.


====Our case massively outweighs any disad — a single asteroid collision is capable of doing more damage than all nuclear weapons in existence combined.====
KUNICH ~’97 **~~ LIEUTENANT COLONEL JOHN C., Staff Judge Advocate, 50th Space Wing, Falcon Air Force Base, Colorado, Air Force Law Review, 41 A.F. L. Rev. 119; Lexis~~**

If you were standing on Kosrae Island off the New Guinea coast on February 1
AND
nuclear weapons in existence combined-approximately 9 million megatons of TNT. n4

====And, extinction is categorically different from any other impact—even if they win a nuclear war kills 99 percent of the population, an asteroid strike still outweighs by an order of magnitude.====
Matheny ~’07 **~~Jason G. Department of Health Policy and Management, Bloomberg School of Public Health, http://jgmatheny.org/matheny_extinction_risk.htm-http://jgmatheny.org/matheny_extinction_risk.htm~~**

Even if extinction events are improbable, the expected values of countermeasures could be large
AND
between risks that threaten 99% of humanity and those that threaten 100%.

 

====And the risk of mass species extinction is beyond dispute. ====

====KUNICH ~’97 **~~LIEUTENANT COLONEL JOHN C., Staff Judge Advocate, 50th Space Wing, Falcon Air Force Base, Colorado, Air Force Law Review, 41 A.F. L. Rev. 119; Lexis~~====**

Irrespective of the ultimate resolution of these controversies, it is beyond dispute that planet 
AND
collision rates of such large bodies with the Earth on long time scales. 
 

====Species extinction risks human extinction.====

====California Academy of Sciences ~’04 **~~last modified 8/21/2004 (http://www.calacademy.org/research/library/biodiv.htm-http://www.calacademy.org/research/library/biodiv.htm~~====**

Currently, more than 10,000 species become extinct each year and while precise

Of course, Earth~’s long history has often been punctuated by much larger cosmic collisions

Ozone is singled out as one of the most important constituents of the atmosphere. 
AND

====Unlike speculative disad impacts, it is statistically inevitable that Earth will be struck by asteroids and comets.====

Even after discovery of the Chicxulub impact structure in Mexico and its temporal simultaneity with

====Observation 2:  Nuclear Deflection ====

====The US has obligated itself to take the lead in NEO defense.====
KOPLOW ~’05 **~~JUSTIN L., J.D., Georgetown University Law Center, Georgetown International Environmental Law Review, Winter 2005, 17 Geo. Int~’l Envtl. L. Rev. 273; Lexis~~**

The fundamental procedures of intercepting an incoming missile and diverting an asteroid are significantly different
AND
are being denied normal means and opportunities for self-defense and protection. 


====NASA is committing the US to a nuclear-only deflection system.====

====Chapman ~’07 **~~Clark R.,Senior Scientist, Southwest Research Institute Dept. of Space Studies, Critique of &amp;#34;2006 Near-Earth Object Survey and Deflection Study: Final Report&amp;#34;,  http://www.b612foundation.org/papers/NASA-CritChap.doc-http://www.b612foundation.org/papers/NASA-CritChap.doc~~====**

Furthermore, the Report takes a totally backwards approach to characterization, saying that we 
AND
argument is &amp;#34;developed&amp;#34; in the middle paragraph of pg. 61.~~.)


====The problem is that nukes won~’t work. Multiple uncertainties make nuclear weapons a bad option for deflection.====

====Schweickart ~’04 **~~Russell L., Chair, B612 Foundation, &amp;#34;Asteroid Deflection; Hopes and Fears,&amp;#34; www.b612foundation.org/papers/Asteroid_Deflection.doc-http://www.b612foundation.org/papers/Asteroid_Deflection.doc~~====**

In both these cases the characteristics of the specific asteroid are clearly critical.  In 
AND
asteroids lead many proponents of deflection to remain skeptical about the nuclear options.


====Nuclear deflection will fail…the warheads will explode on earth.====

====Bekey ~’09 **~~Ivan, Dealing with the THREAT TO EARTH From ASTEROIDS and COMETS, International Academy of Astronautics, http://iaaweb.org/iaa/Scientific%20Activity/Study%20Groups/SG%20Commission%203/sg35/sg35finalreport.pdf-http://iaaweb.org/iaa/Scientific Activity/Study Groups/SG Commission 3/sg35/sg35finalreport.pdf~~====**

There is a persistent notion in lay circles that the way to deal with a dangerous NEO is to
simply hit it with an ICBM and vaporize it in space. Unfortunately, reality 
AND
current technology upper stages, is highly undesirable if not essentially ruled out.

 

====Using a nuclear weapon fragments the asteroid:  increasing the overall threat.====

====Schweickart ~’04 **~~Russell L., Chair, B612 Foundation, &amp;#34;Asteroid Deflection; Hopes and Fears,&amp;#34; www.b612foundation.org/papers/Asteroid_Deflection.doc-http://www.b612foundation.org/papers/Asteroid_Deflection.doc~~====**

The hard options consist of various forms of nuclear explosion as well as that of 
AND
it is highly dependent on the structural character of the asteroid in question.  


 


====Plan: The United States Federal Government should substantially increase grants for solar sail energy research and development in the United States. ====


 

====Observation 3:  Sailvency====


====Nuclear weapons should be considered a means of last resort—98% of asteroids can be deflected with non-nuclear means.====

====Klaes ~’07 **~~Larry, 3/21/20, staff writer, http://seti.sentry.net/archive/bioastro/2007/Mar/0159.html-http://seti.sentry.net/archive/bioastro/2007/Mar/0159.html~~====**

In contrast, Schweickart argues that the so-called &amp;#34;nuclear standoff&amp;#34; option should be used only as a last resort. He contends that 98 percent of the potential threats can be mitigated by using less extreme measures. For example, he favors the development of a &amp;#34;gravity tractor&amp;#34; - a spacecraft that would
Hover near an asteroid for years at a time, using subtle gravitational attraction to draw the space rock out of a worrisome path.  To kick it up a notch, Schweickart said a threatening NEO could first be hit
with a kinetic impactor - say, a scaled-up version of the Deep Impact bullet that hit Comet Tempel 1 back in 2005 - and then the orbital track could be fine-tuned using the tractor. Navigational sensors aboard the tractor would check to make sure the NEO was on a completely safe path.  &amp;#34;This combination is obviously the way to go,&amp;#34; he said.

 

====Nuclear weapon deflection fails—softer forms of deflection are superior.  ====

====Fountain ~’ 02 **~~Henry, 11/19, staff writer, http://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/19/science/space/19ASTE.html-http://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/19/science/space/19ASTE.html~~====**

But it is becoming clear that a longtime assumption of many scientists and of 
AND
shift an asteroid~’s orbit enough to change a hit into a close call.


====Investment in solar sails makes it an immediately feasible option.====

====Johnson et. al. ~’10, NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, AL **~~ L. Johnson 1 , R. Young 1 , D. Alhorn 1 , A. Heaton 1 , T. Vansant 2 , B. Campbell 2 , R. Pappa 3 , W. Keats 3 , P. C. Liewer 4 , D. Alexander 5 , J. Ayon 4 , G. Wawrzyniak 6 , R. Burton 7 , D. Carroll 7 , G. Matloff 8 , and R. Ya. Kezerashvili 8, SOLAR SAIL PROPULSION: ENABLING NEW CAPABILITIES FOR HELIOPHYSICS, http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20110007225_2011006130.pdf~~====**

Taking solar sail propulsion technology from ground testing to flight validation and mission implementation is 
AND
applications, is highly recommended as an outcome of the 2010 Decadal Survey. 


====International norms and laws will force US abandonment of nuclear option once solar sails are viable.====

====Atkinson ~’11, Universe Today **~~Nancy, Every way devised to deflect an asteroid,http://phys.org/news/2011-11-deflect-asteroid.html~~====**

Every Hollywood story dealing with asteroids always involves packing nuclear warheads on board a spaceship 
AND
would serve as a propulsion system to alter the trajectory of the NEO.


====U.S. leadership is essential to effective planetary defense – everyone will follow.====

====Dinerman ~’09 **~~Taylor, staff writer, http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1418/1-http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1418/1~~====**

Yet in the end, it is likely that the decision, if there is 
AND
&amp;#34;global governance&amp;#34; could end up setting the stage for a disaster.



====Solar sails will shift asteroids away from Earth.====

====Blackwell ~’02 **~~Tom, 8/29, National Post, Lexis~~====**

Canadian Dave Balam, one of the world~’s lead trackers of dangerous asteroids and comets
AND
been to attach some sort of engine that could do the same thing.


====NASA assessments prove solar sails are our best option for deflection.====

====Hsu ~’10, SPACE.com Senior Writer **~~Jeremy, Solar Sail Flotilla Could Divert Possibly Dangerous Asteroid, 12/22,http://www.space.com/10531-solar-sail-flotilla-divert-possibly-dangerous-asteroid.html~~====**

A previous NASA assessment of possible asteroid deflection methods had placed solar sails relatively high 
AND
out the solar pressure and keep the sails flying in their proper place.

=Solar FiT~~~’s 1AC=


===Observation One – The Status Quo===


====The federal government is embracing solar as a viable form of energy production, but their plans for expansion are limited to 6 states and utility scale projects.====
**US Dept of Interior ~~~’12** ~~~~~~http://www.doi.gov/news/pressreleases/Obama-Administration-Approves-Roadmap-for-Utility-Scale-Solar-Energy-Development-on-Public-Lands.cfm~~~~~~

As part of President Obama~~~’s all-of-the-above energy strategy to 
AND
support 13,000 construction and operations jobs according to project developer estimates. 


====The Administration~~~’s recent decision to fast-track large-scale solar was a pivot point in our nation~~~’s relationship with solar energy – it was a matter of choice, and the United States Federal Government chose to fund programs that will increase the cost of electricity for the majority of rate payers while guaranteeing a boost in revenue for utilities. ====
**Union Bulletin ~~~’13** ~~~~~~1/3, Small-scale solar~~~’s big potential goes untapped, by Julie Cart,http://union-bulletin.com/news/2013/jan/03/small-scale-solars-big-potential-goes-untapped/~~~~~~

The Obama administration~~~’s solar-power initiative has fast-tracked large-scale plants
AND
also have brought solar power within reach for many homeowners and small businesses.

====These large scale programs, by their very nature, do no integrate into the most overlooked communities — that have been battered by their proximity to fossil fuel industries for decades, and are being excluded as beneficiaries of the solar movement.====
**Cervas ~~~’12**, Coordinator @ California Environmental Justice ~~~~~~Strela, 1/19, Solar for All,http://caleja.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/SmallScaleRDGfitProposal_FINALv4.pdf~~~~~~

Low-income, communities of color have shouldered the burden of living adjacent to 
AND
will give teeth to the concept of investing in communities most in need. 

====This problem is exacerbated by current incentive structures that allow the benefits of solar panels to be reaped by middle and upper class families and businesses while low-income families literally pay the price.====
**Cardwell ~~~’12**, Business Day reporter for The New York Times covering energy ~~~~~~6/4, Diane, Solar Panel Payments Set Off a Fairness Debate, New York Times,http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/05/business/solar-payments-set-off-a-fairness-debate.html?pagewanted=all~~~~~~

In California~~~’s sun-scorched Central Valley, the monthly electric bill can easily top 
AND
continue to encourage rooftop installations, while the utilities have generally been opposed. 


====Thus, we offer the following plan: The Unites States Federal government should implement a feed in tariffs system for solar projects with a project size cap of 500 kilowatts, a program cap of 375 megawatts by 2020 at a &amp;#34;regular annual pace&amp;#34; with a term minimum of 20 years.====


===Observation Two – Solvency ===


====A small-scale FiT structure will facilitate solar installation in low income communities.====
**Cervas ~~~’12**, Coordinator @ California Environmental Justice ~~~~~~Strela, 1/19, Solar for All,http://caleja.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/SmallScaleRDGfitProposal_FINALv4.pdf~~~~~~

1 – Feed-in Tariffs (FiTs) for small-scale projects: 
AND
innovation, education, etc. to local communities, especially underemployed communities.


====These small scale projects will revitalize low income communities and give people control over their energy future.====
**Cervas ~~~’12**, Coordinator @ California Environmental Justice ~~~~~~Strela, 1/19, Solar for All,http://caleja.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/SmallScaleRDGfitProposal_FINALv4.pdf~~~~~~

Low-income communities of color need renewable energy systems that are 1.5 MW or less. A small-scale feed-in tariff program for renewable distributed generation allows rooftop solar that can be sited in low income urban and rural communities. Small-scale projects create jobs, reduce energy bills, generate wealth, revitalize neighborhoods, and give people some control over their energy future. 



====Specifically, and empirically, small-scale feed-in-tariff systems cut utility bills in half. ====

====Evo Energy ~~~’11 **~~~~~~4/12,http://www.triplepundit.com/2012/04/solar-feed-tariffs-uk-clarification/~~~~~~====**

It has been a frantic few months in the short-lived life of the feed-in tariff, with rates cut in half 5
the tariff was designed to encourage the growth of micro-generation from renewable sources 
AND
would rise each year with inflation and was tax-free for homeowners. 


===Observation Three – Forced Out===


====The insanely high cost of energy forced upon low income communities by unequal access to solar strains their already limited budgets – forcing the choice between paying energy bills and every other necessary cost of living, including mortgages and rent.====
**Smith et. al. ~~~’07**, MD %26 MPH – Chairperson of Child Health Impact Assessment Working Group ~~~~~~Lauren A., April, Unhealthy Consequences: Energy Costs and Child Health,http://www.hiaguide.org/sites/default/files/ChildHIAofenergycostsandchildhealth.pdf~~~~~~

High energy costs place increased economic demands on low-income households with limited budgets
AND
suggest that their situation would be even more precarious without this important assistance. 


====Specifically, high utility bills in low income communities are a leading cause of individuals~~~’ %26 families~~~’ inability to maintain the habitability of their home.====
**Smith et. al. ~~~’07**, MD %26 MPH – Chairperson of Child Health Impact Assessment Working Group ~~~~~~Lauren A., April, Unhealthy Consequences: Energy Costs and Child Health,http://www.hiaguide.org/sites/default/files/ChildHIAofenergycostsandchildhealth.pdf~~~~~~

It is well documented that high energy costs can result in unpaid bills, leading 
AND
off moratorium period, families continue to accrue debt for their utility bills. 


====3.5 million people are on the brink of losing their home as we speak.====
**National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty ~~~’12**(4/16, &amp;#34;Law Center Launches &amp;#34;All-In to End Homelessness&amp;#34; Campaign&amp;#34;  ~~~~http://homelessnesslaw.org/2012/04/law-center-launches-%E2%80%9Call-in-to-end-homelessness%E2%80%9D-campaign/-http://homelessnesslaw.org/2012/04/law-center-launches-%E2%80%9Call-in-to-end-homelessness%E2%80%9D-campaign/~~~~)

The &amp;#34;All-In&amp;#34; campaign commemorates the Act~~~’s 25th Anniversary – recognizing its 
AND
to act.  It~~~’s time to fulfill the promise of McKinney-Vento.


====Scenario 1 – Cycle of Trauma====


====The forced move from experiencing low-income housing to homelessness specifically pushes women 
AND
the impact of this trauma and to stop the cycle before it starts.====
**Goodman et.al. 11** ~~~~~~Lisa A. Goodman, Ph.D., Katya Fels, %26 Catherine Glenn, M.A. With contributions from Judy Benitez, No Safe Place: Sexual Assault in the Lives of Homeless Women~~~~~~

Although prevalence rates of homelessness have been estimated at up to seven to eight percent 
AND
creating a growing number of ìspecial needsî victims whose needs are grossly neglected.

====Women experiencing precarious housing situations are uniquely vulnerable to interpersonal violence – this demands our immediate attention.====
**Goodman et.al. 11** ~~~~~~Lisa A. Goodman, Ph.D., Katya Fels, %26 Catherine Glenn, M.A. With contributions from Judy Benitez, No Safe Place: Sexual Assault in the Lives of Homeless Women~~~~~~

Despite over two decades of media and public policy attention, homelessness remains an enormous 
AND
might take to intervene with victims and prevent future sexual assaults from occurring.



====Scenario 2 - Visibility====

====Loss of daily shelter forces people into absolute vulnerability and leads to unspeakable, inescapable violence against them - we must take steps to pull people out of this trap.====
**Norton ~~~’09** ~~~~~~Larry, 8/19, Dehumanizing the homeless: violence and hate, http://blog.oregonlive.com/oldtown/2009/08/dehumanizing_the_homeless_viol.html~~~~~~


====What is the effect of dehumanizing the homeless? Vulnerability. Previously (Part 
AND
message to the many homeless victims. Well so much for day dreams.====

====People experiencing homelessness, even as they are brutalized are literally invisible in our society – our 1ac is an attempt to bring them back into our collective field of vision. Simple recognition is the first step.====
**Jean ~~~’10 **(Abby, August 5, 2010, &amp;#34;Vulnerability: Indexes, Homelessness and Disability&amp;#34; http://disabledfeminists.com/2010/08/05/vulnerability-indexes-homelessness-and-disability/)

This population is considered extremely difficult to serve, as lots have tried to engage 
AND
that – and these programs are proving that assumption to be absolutely wrong.
