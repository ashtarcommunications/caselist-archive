Just Do It! Prioritize the AFF’s action-oriented thought, or phronesis, over the NEG’s understanding-

Case Outweighs - Uniqueness: AFF advocacy of critical indigenous theory is more important than
NEG’s critical advocacy. Because it’s not discussed in academia or policy circles, it’s more necessary
to affirm it in the context of this pedagogical space. Voting AFF valorizes indigenous people and
thought in and of themselves, not simply as a means to another theoretical end.

Intellectuals in pedagogic institutions like debate can function as heterotopic borders, actively
