====Nature escapes representation. All attempts at a totalizing theory of nature must be filtered through ideology, leaving gaps in our understanding. Those gaps fester and frustrate the subject, leading to scapegoating and violence. ====&#xD;
**Zizek 9** (Slavoj, &amp;#34;Excursions with contemporary thinkers&amp;#34;, edited by Astra Taylor)&#xD;
&#xD;
The true ecologist must also accept that nature is the ultimate¶ human myth, &#xD;
AND&#xD;
innocent as it appears, that it is always¶ contaminated by ideology.&#xD;
&#xD;
====And, if we did ever overcome the impacts the 1AC outlines, we would just recreate them to regain the enjoyment of the fight, perpetuating cycles of violence.====&#xD;
**Stavrakakis 99** ~~Yannis, Teaching Fellow in the Dept of Govt at the Univ of Essex %26 Dir of the MA Prog in Ideology and Discourse Analysis, Lacan and the Political, 107-108~~&#xD;
In the light of our theoretical framework, fantasy can only exist as the negation &#xD;
AND&#xD;
fatherland is in danger~’ for example). (Sloterdijk, 1988: 3)&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
**====Thus the alternative – vote negative to do nothing in the face of the 1AC to actively oppose desire.====**&#xD;
&#xD;
====Radical negativity is the only way to create a new positive politics – we must declare that there are no solutions within the current political order. This pure withdrawal from the current ideological coordinates forces us to reinvent politics anew.====&#xD;
**Van Munster 4** ~~Rens, Department of International Politics, University of Wales, &amp;#34;The Desecuritization of Illegal Migration: The Case for a European Belonging without Community&amp;#34;, Marie Curie Working Papers, no. 7~~&#xD;
To face nothingness behind every attempt to articulate a social order thus requires that one &#xD;
AND&#xD;
problem, perhaps makes it impossible&amp;#34; (Kristeva, 1991: 1).&#xD;
However, not everyone is convinced about the usefulness of an approach that considers the &#xD;
AND&#xD;
may entail more concretely within the context of illegal migration and European belonging.&#xD;
&#xD;
====Prefer our method—it~’s historically accurate in the context of politics—analyzing the social without desire can~’t account for ethical modes of violence====&#xD;
**McGowan ~’4** (Todd, Assoc Prof in Film Studies @ UVM, &amp;#34;The End of Dissatisfaction?&amp;#34; p 4-6)&#xD;
Psychoanalysis, however, calls into question the idea that we primarily act on behalf &#xD;
AND&#xD;
past, to traditional values, will necessarily be mediated by the present.&#xD;
