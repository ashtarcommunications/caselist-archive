====Race as a system perpetuates itself on the basis of racial identification. This method of purging racism ignores the broader desire for Whiteness and a separation from it.  Such an investment of power relations leads to inevitable violence and disastrous politics.====
Kalpana **Seshadri-Crooks**, assistant professor of English at Boston College, Desiring Whiteness: A Lacanian analysis of race, **2000**, p. 8-9
My contention that the category of race is inherently a discourse of supremacy may seem 
AND
of power in order to mine the depth of subjective investment in it.


====Feminism~’s revisitation of the evils of patriarchy constitutes a moralizing impulse that maintains monopoly on the good through counter-order.

**====The affirmative is arm chair activism at its best – they demand action like radicals yet they let others do the real work for them. This interpassivity is enjoyment over the suffering of others and the rejection of ethical responsibility====**
**Zizek 97 **~~ŽIŽEK, INSTITUTE FOR SOCIAL SCIENCES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF LJUBLJANA, 1997 ~~SLAVOJ, THE PLAGUE OF FANTASIES,P. 111-113~~
Interpassivity Against this background, one is tempted to supplement the fashionable notion of ~’interactivity~’ 
AND
Yugo-nostalgic attitude was dismissed as a proto-Fascist nationalist.~’



====This moralization is sustained by asceticism, which internalizes suffering by masking it with surplus enjoyment.  This feeds the cycle of the superego and conquers the Real of human experience.====

Zupančič ~’3 (Alenka, Philosopher at the University of Ljubljana, &amp;#34;The Shortest Shadow: Nietzsche~’s Philosophy of the Two,&amp;#34; p 47-52, evidence under erasure //shree)

It might seem that the notion of the ascetic ideal, as well as Nietzsche~’s

**Deleuze ~’6** (ex-professor of phil at Vincennes, Translation by Tomlinson, Nietzsche and Philosophy P 108, gendered language under erasure)

As a result of his type the man of ressentiment does not react: his

====Desire shapes the operation of the social and the direction of their offense.  Linguistic articulation isn~’t perfect, something is always left out of what is being described—this is called the Real.  Since the thing we desire is impossible in perfection, we are locked into a cycle of desire that endlessly tries to re-capture the lacking object of our desire.  ====

**Stavrakakis 99** (Yannis, Teaching Fellow at the Dept of Gov~’t at Essex, Lacan and the Political, p 34//shree)

What should be stressed at this point is that what is at stake here 
AND
what we were promised but that~’s exactly why we keep longing for it.


====Prefer our method—it~’s historically accurate in the context of politics—analyzing the social without desire can~’t account for ethical modes of violence====
**McGowan ~’4** (Todd, Assoc Prof in Film Studies @ UVM, &amp;#34;The End of Dissatisfaction?&amp;#34; p 4-6)
Psychoanalysis, however, calls into question the idea that we primarily act on behalf

**====The aff~’s belief in the ability for more energy production to solve their security problems is a fantasy which locks them into a cycle of escalating security threats. There will always be yet another problem that needs a quick fix, because energy insecurity is inevitable.====**
**HILDYARD ET AL. ~’12** (Nicholas, founder and Director of The Corner House, Larry Lohmann, Energy Analyst @ Corner House, and Sarah Sexton, Research Analyst @ Corner House, &amp;#34;Energy Security For What? For Whom?&amp;#34; The Corner House, February, pp. 73-75)

====The attempt to make nature and the environment a political issue ignores the social coordinates that have created the dangers of environmental catastrophe, and birthed the prevalence of the &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; governmental discourse. The politicization of nature ignores the socio-political circumstances that allow massive disasters. The discussion of Katrina as a political issue of climate change ignores the failure to rebuild levees around the ninth ward, and effectively glosses over the racism implicit in the destruction of New Orleans.====
Swyngedouw, Dept of Geography, School of Environment and Development, Manchester University, 2006.  ~~Eirk, &amp;#34;Impossible &amp;#34;Sustainability&amp;#34; and the Post-Political Condition,&amp;#34;  Forthcoming in: David Gibbs and Rob Krueger (Eds.) Sustainable Development, http://www.liv.ac.uk/geography/seminars/Sustainabilitypaper.doc~~


Although there may be no Nature, there certainly is a politics of nature or a politics of the environment. The collages of apparently contradictory and overlapping vignettes of the environmental conditions outlined above share one common threat that many of us, Bush and Blair, my son and Greenpeace, Oxfam and the World Bank, agree on. The world is in environmental trouble. And we need to act politically now. 
Both the 2004 Tsunami and New Orleans~’s Katrina brought the politicisation of Nature home with 
AND
, rich, conservative, and neo-liberal (Davis, 2006). 
The popular response to Katrina, the barrage of apocalyptic warnings of the pending catastrophes 
AND
current Western socio-environmental politics is what we shall turn to next.


====Disease threats are used to control the social order and the self====

Although I like the implications of Haraway~’s and Martin~’s analyses, an examination of immune 
AND
prey interactions; anything that we cannot kill is ipso facto a competitor. 



====And, if we did ever overcome the impacts the 1AC outlines, we would just recreate them to regain the enjoyment of the fight, perpetuating cycles of violence.====
**Stavrakakis 99** ~~Yannis, Teaching Fellow in the Dept of Govt at the Univ of Essex %26 Dir of the MA Prog in Ideology and Discourse Analysis, Lacan and the Political, 107-108~~
In the light of our theoretical framework, fantasy can only exist as the negation 
AND
to admit; it is easier to attribute all negativity to the Jew:
All that is bad in society (crises, wars, famines, upheavals, 
AND
of the universe in the Jews (Sartre, 1995: 40)12
As Jerrold Post has pointed out, we are always bound to those we hate
AND
as negating it. The result of this dialectic is always the same:
The tragic paradox of utopianism has been that instead of bringing about, as it promised, a system of final and permanent stability, it gave rise to utter restlessness, and in place of a reconciliation between human freedom and social cohesion, it brought totalitarian coercion. (Talmon, 1971: 95)
In that sense, as it was implicitly argued in Chapter 2, the notion 
AND
have recourse to its other dark dimension in order to explain their failure:
the foreclosed obverse of the Nazi harmonious Volksgemeinschaft returned in their paranoiac obsession with ~’the Jewish plot~’. Similarly, the Stalinists compulsive discovery of ever-new enemies of socialism was the inescapable obverse of their pretending to realise the idea of the ~’New Socialist Man~’. (Zizek, 1996a: 116)
For Zizek, these two dimensions ~’are like front and back of the same 
AND
maintain its hold~’ (ibid.). Utopia is not that far from dystopia.
What is at stake in the Lacanian conception of fantasy is, as we have 
AND
stake here is not rational argumentation but the organisation and administration of enjoyment:
The impotence of the attitude of traditional Enlightenment is best exemplified by the anti-racist who, at the level of rational argumentation, produces a series of convincing reasons against the racist Other, but is nonetheless clearly fascinated by the object of his critique – and consequently, all his defence disintegrates in the moment of real crisis (when ~’the fatherland is in danger~’ for example). (Sloterdijk, 1988: 3)

AND
intellect and study that these other areas of nonprofit practice have been accorded. 

====(3)  The affirmative chooses its ground—they have infinite prep time to select the best justifications for the plan and the last decade of debates show they can adapt them to accommodate particular teams.  Our interp checks infinite regression—our interpretation prevents negatives from stealing the whole 1AC minus one word, the alternative must interrogate the justifications of the aff holistically.====

====(4)  Predictability—Framing is a central question in the literature ====

This interdisciplinary work is made possible by the fact that the concept of framing is

====Attempts to secure our experience of existence – physically or psychologically – suppress and internalize paranoic fear. This produces life as a managerial project where we constantly struggle to perfect it through security. This fuels a ressentiment that negates beauty and life.====

Philosophically, it is a terrible mistake. It is a terrible mistake precisely in

Death is the Birth of Potentiality.  Death is inevitable—choosing to accept this eventuality affirms the freedom of different forms of becoming and arrangements of matter

Fear of death is a function of the ego~’s separation from externality; death is an illusion because our bodies are always already dead and dying—surrender is key to transcendence.

What bothers people about losing the body is that it seems like a terrible break
