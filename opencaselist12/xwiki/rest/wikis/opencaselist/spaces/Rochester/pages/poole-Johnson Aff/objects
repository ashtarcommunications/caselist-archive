ADVANTAGE ONE: ENERGY POVERTY
Conventional Financing is not available for small scale solar projects

Crowdfunding distributed solar in the poorer parts of the planet is key to solving the suffering of billions of people

But the real opportunity for crowdfunders … like solar crowdfunders, do.

Obsession with short-time frame impacts obscures ongoing violence that doesn’t fit neatly within conventional temporal frames 
Nixon 10 (Rob, Rachel Carson Professor of English, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Slow Violence and the Environmentalism of the Poor, pp 1-14)

ADVANTAGE TWO: DEMOCRATIC FINANCING
Solar Crowdfunding is critical for democratized financing and participation in electricity production

Toronto Star 2012 (12/22/12, “social finance being tapped for clean energy)ken:)

Banks? Venture capitalists? … this kind of investment.
A small number of profit driven elites control status quo energy – democratic financing changes this power dynamic

Emancipatory finance requires reduced restrictions on Crowd-Funding

Part III The Research Project: Crowdfunding as Alternative Ordering Practice? Project Description ¶ In our research project (which is still in the funding phase) titled Spacing Ethics: Freedom in the Enactment of Heterotopian Spaces, we address three fields of problematization (Callon, 1986; Foucault, 1986): (a) the field of finance whose prevailing lending practices proved insufficient for bringing into … space of freedom.

Crowdfunding liberates the social from neoliberalism only if government regulations are kept out of the natural unfolding of events. To unpack Civil Society, Allow it to roam free without thingification.

A crowdfunding exemption would undoubtedly facilitate capital formation….  could, therefore, be positive.

Delays require congressional action to move crowdfunding forward –restrictions just increase the cost of crowdfunding and prevents investment
