===Plan: The US Federal Government should extend the expired 1603 Cash grant.===


===Observation 1-The 1603 cash grant has expired as Congress failed to pass the legislation. ===


===The fiscal cliff deal has not extended the 1603 grant. ===

On January 2, 2013, President Obama signed the American Taxpayer Relief Act of

under section 1603 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Tax Act of 2009.


===Expired 1603 grant hurts both wind and solar industries as financing solar projects becomes more risky. ===

Valenza-http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/u/SolarFred;jsessionid=AF4A72D74DB68100159F188FE0A9B616  12 (Valenza is the founder of Unthink Solar. &amp;#34;Why the 1603 Treasury Grant Program Matters to Solar and RE&amp;#34;)
Some may see 1603 as a program that only benefits large scale solar, but 1603 indirectly benefits the residential solar community, as well as solar thermal, and all other renewables. Without 1603, wind, geothermal, tidal energy — you name it — are all going to see declines in 2012 after any residual &amp;#34;safe harbors&amp;#34; have expired.
Briefly, 1603 is a grant (cash) that is given to commercial and 
AND
other RE), and that means investors will invest in fewer solar projects.



===Contention 1- Global warming.===


===Global warming is caused by CO2 emissions and can lead to human extinction. ===

===Contention 3-Economy ===
 

===Economic investment and 1603 cash grant strengthens solar and wind industries, and provides more money to the government. ===

===Renewable Energy is key to provide long-term economic security, and offer a conducive environment for research %26 development.===

Mendonça, Jacobs, and Sovacool in 2010 (Miguel, Researcher, author and advocate of sustainability and resilience strategies, David, Director Renewable Energy, IFOK GmbH, and Benjamin K., Visiting Associate Professor at Vermont Law School, &amp;#34;Powering the Green Economy: The feed-in tariff handbook&amp;#34;, p. 1-2)

~’The green economy~’ is a somewhat bemusing term from the perspective of the ecologist
AND
and Joe Biden promised to create ﬁve million new jobs through green measures.  


===Without increasing job growth, we are headed to an economic disaster===

Levin, 2011 (Becky, AFSCME news letter, http://www.afscme.org/news/publications/newsletters/works/fall-2011/economic-recovery-relies-on-jobs-http://www.afscme.org/news/publications/newsletters/works/fall-2011/economic-recovery-relies-on-jobs) American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.

Investing in the working middle class is the surest path to an economic recovery that works for everyone, not just CEOs and huge corporations.
Before the plan can create its first job, Congress has to do its job
AND
their fair share is better than laying off nurses, teachers and firefighters.&amp;#34;
The President~’s plan recognizes that we have a jobs problem and a revenue problem (not surprising with an unfair tax system that lets major corporations dodge taxes and that finds millionaires paying lower percentages on their incomes than some of their employees.)
Congress has spent the past year arguing over the budget and the debt ceiling while doing nothing to create jobs. In August, the economy created exactly zero jobs. Without major action, the economy could be headed toward a &amp;#34;double-dip&amp;#34; recession.

===Taxable cash incentives provide the government more money than tax incentives ===
Varadarajan et. al 12 (Varadarajan , Pierpont, Hobbs, Rowley are members of the Climate Policy Initiative. CPI is policy analytic organization whose purpose is to &amp;#34;assess, diagnose, and support&amp;#34; actions and efforts of key governments globally to achieve low-carbon growth).

Government can save money while providing the same support for projects by using taxable cash 
AND
price risk to government, as discussed in section 5.3 below. 
For the small solar PV facilities, a 1603 Cash Grant led to a cost of electricity at least %2415/MWh lower than any financing structure with a tax credit. This is largely due to the fixed financial fees associated with obtaining tax equity financing for small projects, equivalent to %2429-38/ MWh generated. On the other hand, the large solar PV case yielded essentially equivalent cost of electricity with the ITC and 1603 Cash Grant.




===Cash tax incentives are more flexible for investors. ===
Varadarajan et. al 12 (Varadarajan , Pierpont, Hobbs, Rowley are members of the Climate Policy Initiative. CPI is policy analytic organization whose purpose is to &amp;#34;assess, diagnose, and support&amp;#34; actions and efforts of key governments globally to achieve low-carbon growth).
Cash incentives can be used by any investor, whereas tax benefits require tax liabilities

as the current ITC at half the cost to state and federal governments.

Green business expansion is critical to innovation, competitiveness, and economic security
