They are right about one thing: the United States is not likely to be 
AND
failed to capitalize on a technology that we once held in our hands.

====Slippage on the technological innovation is perceived as a sign of the decline of US Global Hegemony.====
**Drezner 1 (Daniel Drezner (professor of international politics at The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University) 2001 &amp;#34;State structure, technological leadership and the maintenance of hegemony&amp;#34; http://www.danieldrezner.com/research/tech.pdf)**

In this decade, proponents of globalization argue that because information and capital are mobile

policy — or start bracing itself for a dangerous slide into global turmoil.



==Advantage 2: Economy==

====Slowing growth, increased taxes and the debt crises will result in a recession now.====

In addition, policy makers and the public must understand the clear linkages that exist   
AND

====Unchecked nuclear spread will cause global nuclear war – shorter flight times and lack of second strike capacity.====
**Cimbala 8 **(Stephen, Political Science Professor at the University of Pennsylvania, March, &amp;#34;Anticipatory Attacks: Nuclear Crisis Stability in Future Asia&amp;#34; Comparative Strategy, Vol 27 No 2, p 113-132, InformaWorld)

The spread of nuclear weapons in Asia presents a complicated mosaic of possibilities in this 
AND
might be inaccurate guides to the avoidance of war outside of Europe.19


===Meltdowns===

====Old reactor types make meltdowns inevitable – reactors have shut down in the past and the NRC has failed at regulation====
**Gronlund 7** (Nuclear power in a Warming world: Assessing the Risks, Addressing the Challenges, Lisbeth Gronlund;  David Lochbaum;  Edwin Lyman, Union of Concerned Scientists, [[http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/nuclear_power/nuclear-power-in-a-warming-world.pdf-http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/nuclear_power/nuclear-power-in-a-warming-world.pdf]]) JD

Safety problems remain despite a lack of   serious accidents.   A serious nuclear power accident

In the modern era, the idea that strong economic performance is the foundation of

====U.S. Hegemony is key to check a great power war and extinction.====

**Wohlforth 9 **(William C. Wohlforth, a professor of government at Dartmouth College, 2009 &amp;#34;Unipolarity, Status Competition, and Great Power War&amp;#34; Project Muse)

====1. Permutation do the plan and all non-competitive parts of the alternative – heidegger concedes calculative thinking is inevitable – if the alternative can justify it~’s calculated rejection of certain forms of thinking then there~’s no reason it excludes the affirmative. We are a productive form of calculative thinking that is intended to preserve life for ontological examination====
**Buckley 89**
(R. Philip.; McGill university; &amp;#34;Rationality and Responsibility in Heidegger~’s and Husserl~’s View of Technology,&amp;#34; 1989, http://ulla.mcgill.ca/arts150/arts150r3.htm)

At the root of Heidegger~’s understanding of technology is the fundamental distinction between &amp;#34;calculative 
AND
&amp;#34; are plausible translations of Heidegger~’s basic characterization of contemplative though as Gelassenheit.

====Our impacts are true and outweigh the K—our ontological approach to the world is valid and the alt dooms us to endless questioning====

**Robbins 99** (Brent Dean Robbins, doctoral student in clinical psychology @ Duquesne University.  &amp;#34;Medard Boss,&amp;#34; http://mythosandlogos.com/Boss.html) 
Medicine, deriving its foundations from Descartes, begins with an understanding of a split 
AND
thing, I am in-the-world as a embodied being. 



====4. We outweigh – short term risk of aff impacts outweighs potential for the K~’s political violence impacts. No uniqueness on any of the K~’s ontological violence claims means you have no reason to preference those impacts in your decision calculus.====

====5. Permutation solves best. The solution must arise from the technology that created the problem – the plan and alt function together to restore the world.====

**Thiele 3** – Professor of Political Science at the University of Florida – 2003 ~~Leslie Paul, &amp;#34;The Ethics and Politics of Narrative,&amp;#34; Foucalt and Heidegger: Critical Encounters, editors – Rosenberg and Milchman~~

**Bookchin 95**, Founder of the Institute for Social Ecology and Former Professor at Ramapo College, 1995 (Murray, Re-enchanting Humanity, p. 168-170)

&amp;#34;Insofar as Heidegger can be said to have had a project to shape human 
AND
-living people who were put to death by the National Socialist state.


====Turn – The alternative~’s rejection of pragmatism makes extinction inevitable. Our evidence subsumes theirs — the threat of extinction does justify action. ====
**Santoni 1985 **~~Ronald E. Santoni, Phil. Prof @ Denison, 1985, Nuclear War, ed. Fox and Groarke, p. 156-7~~ 
To be sure, Fox sees the need for our undergoing &amp;#34;certain fundamental changes

**Hicks 3**, Professor and chair of philosophy at Queens College of the CUNY, 2003** **(Steven V., &amp;#34;Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Foucault: Nihilism and Beyond,&amp;#34; Foucault and Heidegger: Critical Encounters, Ed. Alan Milchman and Alan Rosenberg, p. 109, Questia)

Why a &amp;#34;philosophical shock&amp;#34;? The answer, in part, may be 
AND
be &amp;#34;our only chance to keep from extinguishing life on earth altogether.&amp;#34;  


====10. Heidegger wasn~’t a Nazi in spite of his philosophy, he was a Nazi because of his ontology first approach. Heidegger elevated Nazi politics as an ontic political engagement that opened up possibilities of ontological revelation. It was the willingness to sacrifice anything to the ontological that necessarily privileges fascist control and &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; communities. ====

**Zizek 99**, Senior Researcher at the Institute for Social Sciences in Ljubljana, 1999 (Slavoj, The Ticklish Subject, p. 13-15)
Apropos of this precise point, I myself run into my first trouble with 
AND
ontic engage¬ment, any ontic engagement is depreciated, loses its authentic dignity.


**====11. The abstraction of ontological openness trades off with the practical analysis of concrete phenomena – this inevitably results in an unreflective engagement with death that creates the conditions for totalitarianism and world war====**
**Wenning 2 **~~Mario, &amp;#34;Heidegger and Adorno: Opening up Grounds for a Dialogue&amp;#34; GNOSIS, Vol. IV No. 1. Associate Professor of History @ Concordia. http://alcor.concordia.ca/~~gnosis/vol_vi/Heidegger_Adorno.pdf-http://alcor.concordia.ca/~gnosis/vol_vi/Heidegger_Adorno.pdf~~
The promise to carry out an existential analysis, Adorno argues, remain unfulfilled in

regimes not just of the second but also of the first world war.


**====Zimmerman agrees – Heidegger~’s Nazism is deeply problematic and requires us to rethink modernity rather than reject it outright. Revolutionary politics is preferable to a Heideggerian alternative.====**

====Legal framing and stereotypes force American Indians to internalize two equally dangerous representations – those of the &amp;#34;noble savage&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;fierce savage&amp;#34; who owns casinos and plays fast and loose with the law – these images pre-frame decision making vis-a-vie American Indians. ====&#xD;

====Self-determined energy policy is critical to the operation of sovereign states.

====That dual characterization of the Indian as provided two sets of violent encounters with the Indian other.

==THE PLAN:==


====The United States Federal Government should exempt solar energy production crowdfunding projects from Securities and Exchange Commission and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority compliance for energy production in the United States.====

==ADVANTAGE ONE: ENERGY POVERTY==

====Conventional Financing is not available for small scale solar projects====
**MONTGOMERY 2013 (James – Associate Editor Renewable Energy World — , Mosaic Plans Crowdfunding for Solar Projects, http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2013/01/mosaic-plants-crowdfunding-flag-for-solar-projects-http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2013/01/mosaic-plants-crowdfunding-flag-for-solar-projects) KEN:-) **

Right now there is a very limited number of equity players, specialized banks or 
AND
%24100,000 rooftop solar plant the transaction costs are too high.&amp;#34;


====Status Quo Energy Policy makes solar inaccessible – Accessible solar necessary to alleviate poverty====
**Rheannon 11**(Francesca, degrees from UWM in History, American U in Economics, University of Massachusetts Amherst in Counseling,  University of Connecticut in Social Work, Solar Power To The People, CSRWire Talkback, 4/26/2011 http://goo.gl/j0Te9 \\stroud)

Jones was making the point that the high cost of solar power means &amp;#34;wealthy 
AND
suit. That~’s a kind of trickle-up economics that benefits all.

====Energy poverty is the worst kind of poverty. Solar Key to Solve  ====
**Walsh.  2011.  Brian Walsh – Senior Science Writer TIME magazines, &amp;#34;The Worst Kind of Poverty: Energy Poverty,&amp;#34; Time Magazine, October 11, 2011. – M.E.**
&amp;#34;Lacking access to electricity affects health, well-being and income,&amp;#34; says 
AND
can do is wake up to the fact that everyone deserves a light.

====Maintaining Status-Quo financial structures is an act of structural violence – outweighs other impacts====
**Abu-Jamal 1998**, Mumia, a former reporter, A Quiet and Deadly Violence, http://www.flashpoints.net/mQuietDeadlyViolence.html

It has often been observed that America is a truly violent nation, as shown 
AND
This fatal and systematic violence may be called The War on the Poor. 

====US Securities law is modeled globally====
**CAL-CAP 2007 (magazine of the California society of certified public accountants; http://www.calcpa.org/Content/24630.aspx)Ken:)**
 Because there are multiple sets of standards, the timetables are not necessarily the 
AND
its way to converging financial reporting, auditing and ethics standards by 2009.

====Crowdfunding distributed solar in the poorer parts of the planet is key to solving the suffering of billions of people ====

**GUAY 2013 **(Justin — Washington Representative for the Sierra Club, &amp;#34;Social Bankability&amp;#34; http://www.huffingtonpost.com/justin-guay/social-bankability-solar-_b_2440626.html?utm_hp_ref=tw-http://www.huffingtonpost.com/justin-guay/social-bankability-solar-_b_2440626.html?utm_hp_ref=tw, 1/13/13)ken:)

But the real opportunity for crowdfunders lies with distributed solar in emerging markets where the 
AND
a foundation of social bankability by disruptive innovators like solar crowdfunders, do.


====Obsession with short-time frame impacts obscures ongoing violence that doesn~’t fit neatly within conventional temporal frames ====
**Nixon 10** (Rob, Rachel Carson Professor of English, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Slow Violence and the Environmentalism of the Poor, pp 1-14)
When Lawrence Summers, then president of the World Bank, advocated thai the bank 
AND
how our rhetorical conventions for bracketing violence routinely ignore ongoing, belated casualties.


==ADVANTAGE TWO: DEMOCRATIC FINANCING==

====Solar Crowdfunding is critical for democratized financing and participation in electricity production====

**Toronto Star 2012 (12/22/12, &amp;#34;social finance being tapped for clean energy)ken:)**

Banks? Venture capitalists? Private-equity investors?¶ Bah%21 Who needs them
AND
simply aren~’t set up to mobilize the masses for this kind of investment.

====A small number of profit driven elites control status quo energy – democratic financing changes this power dynamic====

Hoffman, PhD, Professor of Political Science at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minnesota, and Angela High-Pippert, PhD, Director of Women~’s Studies at the University of St. Thomas, and serves on the ACTC Women~’s Studies Coordinating Committee, &amp;#34;Community Energy: A Social Architecture for an Alternative Energy Future&amp;#34;, Bulletin of Science Technology %26 Society 2005 25: 387~~

The evolution of the industrialized world~’s electrical system represents one of the great technological achievements 
AND
fuel cells continue to be a promising alternative¶ (Sawin, 2004).


====Elite control of energy leads to violence that is the cause of the neg~’s disads. ====
**Champain 11 **~~Phil, Director of Programs at the peacebuilding NGO International Alert, &amp;#34;Changing energy provision – a peacebuilding opportunity?&amp;#34;, January~~
Consider the conflict management challenges inherent within the system of energy provision based on oil 
AND
lead to violence and instability, inhibiting development and security for vulnerable communities.


====Emancipatory finance requires reduced restrictions on Crowd-Funding====
**DEY %26 MARTI 2012  **(Pascal, University of St. Gallen, Laurent, Univ of St. Gallen, Democratization, Marketization, and the Thrid Sector ISTR, 10th International Confernece, July 10013, 2012, University of Siena, Italy 1, &amp;#34;~’Civil Society~’ and the Need to Zoom In – Enacting the Socail through Crowdfunding)ken:-)
Part III The Research Project: Crowdfunding as Alternative Ordering Practice? Project Description ¶ 
AND
place outside of power and do not engender an authentic space of freedom.


====Crowdfunding liberates the social from neoliberalism only if government regulations are kept out of the natural unfolding of events. To unpack Civil Society, Allow it to roam free without thingification.====

**DEY %26 MARTI 2012 (Pascal, University of St. Gallen, Laurent, Univ of St. Gallen, Democratization, Marketization, and the Thrid Sector ISTR, 10th International Confernece, July 10013, 2012, University of Siena, Italy 1, &amp;#34;~’Civil Society~’ and the Need to Zoom In – Enacting the Socail through Crowdfunding)ken:-)**

„Civil society‟, a term which to this day has remained elusive for most 
AND
‟ is thingified (i.e. made appear as an essence). 

====The process of fixing and knowing is thingification – these patterns of rhetorical domination are the same as the patterns that move colonized bodies to non-beings and results in perpetual violence.====
**Bogues 2012 (A. &amp;#34;And what about the human? Freedom, Human emancipation, and the radical imagination&amp;#34; Boundry 2, 39:3)ken:-) ohhh you got turned%21**
Aimé Césaire puts all of this very well when he writes that the colonial encounter 
AND
practices of freedom. So it is to that question we now turn.


====Neoliberal Commodification makes human extinction inevitable through the destruction of democracy and human ethics====
Boaventura de Souza Santos, Professor of Sociology at the University of Coimbra, Collective Suicide?, http://www.ces.fe.uc.pt/opiniao/bss/072en.php 2003

According to Franz Hinkelammert, the West has repeatedly been under the illusion that it 
AND
machine of democracy and liberty turns into a machine of horror and destruction.

====Our methodological approach to the resolution vis-à-vis democratization of crowdfunding is the starting point for reimagining the social====
**DEY %26 MARTI 2012 (Pascal, University of St. Gallen, Laurent, Univ of St. Gallen, Democratization, Marketization, and the Thrid Sector ISTR, 10th International Confernece, July 10013, 2012, University of Siena, Italy 1, &amp;#34;~’Civil Society~’ and the Need to Zoom In – Enacting the Socail through Crowdfunding)ken:-)**

We approach the nexus of crowdfunding and power by not locating the latter in a 
AND
in which the analysis is carried will become a matter of mutual negotiation. 



====Democratization of the financial sector is critical to solve serial economic failure – our reimagining of the social and its relation to finance spills over to broader social change and solves====
**Hardt %26 Negri 12** (Michael – Prof Comparative Lit Duke; Antonio – Italian terrorist; &amp;#34;Declaration&amp;#34;)
Banks. In order to realize the constituent principles and ¶ inalienable rights of the 
AND
production, reproduction, and distribution ¶ of social wealth through democratic participation. 




==Solvency==

====Implementation of the JOBS ACT is at a standstill – lobbyists are gumming up the works and regulator~’s are overburdening crowd-funding provisions====
**GUPTA 2012** (Udayan, &amp;#34;Dodd-Frank Lobbysists Delaying JOBS act implementation&amp;#34;, Institutional Investor, 10/12, l/n)ken:)

Implementation of the JOBS Act, which President Barack Obama -http://www.lexisnexis.com.ezp.lib.rochester.edu/lnacui2api/search/XMLCrossLinkSearch.do?bct=A%26risb=21_T16486690507%26returnToId=20_T16486880758%26csi=318073%26A=0.6615065389590501%26sourceCSI=9369%26indexTerm=%23PE0009TJP%23%26searchTerm=Barack%20Obama%20%26indexType=Psaid would jumpstart start-
AND
Dodd-Frank, they also will keep holding up the JOBS Act.


====AND, S.E.C. Restrictions are too burdensome and unrepresentative of the commons – Change is needed to create an open community financing network====
**Cunningham ~’13 **(William M — D.C.-based economist and social investing advisor, 1/15/13, http://www.sec.gov/comments/jobs-title-iii/jobstitleiii-200.htm)sam-http://www.sec.gov/comments/jobs-title-iii/jobstitleiii-200.htm)sam m.

In about six months, the beleaguered Securities and Exchange Commission will put forward rules 
AND
doesnt take longer and make this more complicated than it needs to be.


====FINRA restrictions further delay by an additional year====
**Washington Post 2012 (11/19/12, Deadline Approaching)ken:)**
Meanwhile, the SEC rules aren~’t the last remaining hurdle. The JOBS Act also 
AND
entrepreneurs. &amp;#34;We~’re ready for a good long wait,&amp;#34; Rowe said.


====Our Crowdfunding exemption will result in a wave of funding for solar projects====
**BRADFORD 2012 (C. Steven – Prof Securities Law University Nebraska-Lincoln, &amp;#34;Crowdfunding and the federal securities laws&amp;#34;, 2012 Colum. Bus. L. Rev. 1, Columbia Business Law Review)ken:)**
A crowdfunding exemption would undoubtedly facilitate capital formation. Very small businesses, particularly startups
AND
risks. The net effect on investors could, therefore, be positive.


====Delays require congressional action to move crowdfunding forward –restrictions just increase the cost of crowdfunding and prevents investment====
**QUINN 2012 **(Daniel – consultant and author. Cnn ireport staff, 12/27/12, &amp;#34;The SEC is holding up Crowdfunding Platforms approved through the jobs act&amp;#34; http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-902680)ken:)

When The Jobs Act became law in April business owners and entrepreneurs were supposed to 
AND

**GUAY 2013 (Justin, &amp;#34;Social Bankability&amp;#34; http://www.huffingtonpost.com/justin-guay/social-bankability-solar-_b_2440626.html?utm_hp_ref=tw-http://www.huffingtonpost.com/justin-guay/social-bankability-solar-_b_2440626.html?utm_hp_ref=tw, 1/13/13)ken:)**
If we are going to avoid the worst impacts of climate change we need disruptive 
AND
U.S. clean energy leadership and not a moment too soon.


====Solar allows the decentralization of power sources====

**Behles ~’12 **(Deborah, law prof and clinical attorney at Golden Gate U, &amp;#34;An Integrated Green Urban Electrical Grid,&amp;#34; 36 Wm. %26 Mary Envtl. L. %26 Pol~’y Rev. 671) 
The energy grid structure that most commonly still exists in urban areas, even the 
AND
environments away from their fossil-fuel dependence to a new urban grid. 


====The critical potential of the affirmative is only realized if we are not judged a-priori – failure to identify different types of crowdfunding effects make critique static and ineffective====

**DEY %26 MARTI 2012 **(Pascal, University of St. Gallen, Laurent, Univ of St. Gallen, Democratization, Marketization, and the Thrid Sector ISTR, 10th International Confernece, July 10013, 2012, University of Siena, Italy 1, &amp;#34;~’Civil Society~’ and the Need to Zoom In – Enacting the Socail through Crowdfunding)ken:-)

Concluding Remarks ¶ In this paper we have discussed some of the shortcomings associated with

====Second is the &amp;#34;noble savage&amp;#34; – The patronizing image of American Indians as land-loving hippies created the American Indian as the abject– the perverse underside of the sophisticated, urbane American identity that needed to be repressed and eliminated. Historical encounters with America~’s abjected other have led to objectification and genocide.====

====The defining of an American subject in opposition to the abject &amp;#34;noble savage&amp;#34; writes more than just Indians into oppression.

The &amp;#34;greedy casino owner&amp;#34; image is where the excesses of American capitalism and colonialism can be dumped onto American Indians. ====

==Contention 2: Domestic Dependent Nations==


====The status of Indian Tribes as domestic dependent nations codifies the dual character of the American subject: one that is colonialist through the continuing legacy of manifest destiny and one that is anti-colonialist as a product of revolution.

The defining of an American subject in opposition to the abject &amp;#34;noble savage&amp;#34; writes more than just Indians into oppression. The constitution of the American subject has all but eliminated the Native as its perverse underside. Absent an ethical intervention, the continuing process of abjection ensures that America will only ever define the social ideal as white and male, thereby eliminating all other identities.

and obsession. This is the dynamic that pushes America’s noncitizens into uncanniness.



The colonization of Indian is the fuel that sustains American empire – attempts to include abjected and objected voices within the framework of American empire only serve to misdirect us from our ultimate task – the consideration of Indiannes is a prior question.

There is more than one way to frame the concerns of The Transit of¶ 
AND
queers, racial minorities, and immigrants¶ into complicity with settler colonialism.


The condition of utopian projects like the quest for a stable American identity is failure: to stabilize, our psyches must produce a scapegoat onto which we project our frustration in failing to achieve utopia. For our psyches to be satisfied our failures must be externalized onto the scapegoat, and then eliminated, necessitating genocide. The &amp;#34;greedy casino owner&amp;#34; image is where the excesses of American capitalism and colonialism can be dumped onto American Indians.

Contention 2: Domestic Dependent Nations


The status of Indian Tribes as domestic dependent nations codifies the dual character of the American subject: one that is colonialist through the continuing legacy of manifest destiny and one that is anti-colonialist as a product of revolution.  Much like tribes within American borders, the abject Native must remain repressed within the psyche to maintain the coherence of the subject’s identity.

One scholar who does share my fascination with the compelling pleasures of hauntedness is Julia 
AND

And, the split generates violence. The dual character of the American subject has created a fantasy of rationality and superiority over the abject Indian. This fantasy is unstable and relies on a national obsession with symbolically condensed Indians, which do not exist.

Bergland 2k

While Fiedler describes Americans as men in love with their own madness (which takes

which American subjects continually return to the Native American figures who haunt them. 


And, American psychosis makes extinction inevitable – nuclear technology has enabled the conditions for our unconscious death drive to break through the cracks in our fantasy and punish those who have broken it – this makes nuclear use inevitable.

Energy development is critical to Tribal Sovereignty – easing TERA restrictions makes it an agreement between two sovereigns.

For this reason, some commentators believe that tribal economic¶ development is necessarily at

And ethics is the basis of politics - advocating for Native renewable energy development is necessary to create epistemological fissures that can begin to rectify historical traumas of energy exploitation. Vote aff to ethically remedy the historical trauma committed against Native populations.

And, ethics comes first – our aff is a prerequisite to ethical relations with the other – we must analyze the foundations of the American subject in order to tear down its colonial legacy and rebuild our psyches without leveling difference. Affirming an ethic of cohabitation instead of absorption stops the cycle of genocidal violence necessitated by status quo political relations.

Psychoanalysis, however, calls into question the idea that we primarily act on behalf

And, tying to the particularities of the status quo as they occur in with regards to Indians to the universal of ideology allows us to interrogate the point at which ideological lines meet, creating an opportunity to untie the ideological knot

Ridiculous as this notion of the ’typical’ may sound, there is a grain of

Ethics are a prior question to politics – the status quo operationalizes politics that create ethics to justify them post-facto. This model of politics is doomed to serial policy failure because of the unstable nature of our psyches.
