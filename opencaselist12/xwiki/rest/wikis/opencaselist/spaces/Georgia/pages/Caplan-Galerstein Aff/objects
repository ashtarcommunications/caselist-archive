Additional gains would be realized because natural gas exports would exploit existing LNG infrastructure (i.e. some parts of existing import terminals) that would otherwise go unused and thus be worthless. These gains should approximately equal the value of the utilized LNG terminals (not including the value of their regasification facilities, which are not useful for exports), which are typically on the order of $1 billion for each billion cubic feet a day of capacity. Spread over a notional fifteen-year use period, this would add approximately $70 million a year for each billion cubic feet a day of exports. This brings the total estimated surplus from six billion cubic feet a day of exports to $3.1 billion to $3.7 billion.&#xD;

Schwartz 3 (Joel, Adjunct Scholar – Competitive Enterprise Institute, “Particulate Air Pollution: Weighing the Risks”, April, http://cei.org/pdf/3452.pdf)

Nonetheless, both the Bush Administration and congressional Democrats have proposed sweeping new measures to further crack down on power plant emissions.  The Administration’s Clear Skies Initiative and a more stringent Democratic alternative are largely justified by claims that current levels of particulate matter (PM) pose a serious public health threat.   Supporters of these bills promise substantial benefits from additional PM reductions.  
Nevertheless, the benefit claims for PM reductions rest on a weak foundation. EPA

Contention One is the Energy revolution 
Fracking is unsustainable – access to new conventional natural gas is key to transition
Dorsey 12 (Gregory, Managing Editor – Leeb’s Income Performance Letter, “Fractured Logic: The Myth of Abundant Natural Gas,” Leeb’s Market Forecast, 5-9, http://leebsmarketforecast.com/content/fractured-logic-myth-abundant-natural-gas)

A popular meme these days is the idea that natural gas is America’s salvation on 
AND
also have a healthy exposure to crude oil earn the highest honors. q
Consumption will dry up shale 
Berman 12 (Art, Former Editor – Oil and Gas Journal, Geological Consultant – American Association of Petroleum Geologists, “After the Gold Rush: A Perspective on Future U.S. Natural Gas Supply and Price,” Oil Drum, 2-8, http://www.theoildrum.com/node/8914)
For several years, we have been asked to believe that less is more, 
AND
what is the basis for long-term projections of abundant gas supply?
Best Data goes aff – shale is not economic and production will only decline, causing price spikes 
Heinberg, 10/22/12 Richard, He is Senior Fellow-in-Residence of the Institute and is widely regarded as one of the world’s foremost Peak Oil educators, He has authored scores of essays and articles that have appeared in such journals as Nature, The Ecologist, The American Prospect, Public Policy Research, Quarterly Review, Z Magazine, Resurgence, The Futurist, European Business Review, Earth Island Journal, Yes!, Pacific Ecologist, and The Sun; and on web sites such as Alternet.org, EnergyBulletin.net, TheOilDrum.com, ProjectCensored.com, and Counterpunch.com.¶ He has appeared in many film and television documentaries, including Leonardo DiCaprio’s 11th Hour, is a recipient of the M. King Hubbert Award for Excellence in Energy Education, and in 2012 was appointed to His Majesty the King of Bhutan&amp;#39;s International Expert Working Group for the New Development Paradigm initiative, “Gas Bubble Leaking, About to Burst”, http://www.postcarbon.org/blog-post/1262435-gas-bubble-leaking-about-to-burst 

In those early days almost no one wanted to hear about problems with the shale 
AND
millions of cars and trucks to run on gas, now ring hollow. 
No surplus now – price spike is immanent 
Moors 1-24 (Dr. Kent, internationally recognized expert in oil and natural gas policy, risk assessment, and emerging market economic development, “Betting on the Coming Boom in Natural Gas Prices,” Money Morning, 2013, http://moneymorning.com/2013/01/24/betting-on-the-coming-boom-in-natural-gas-prices/)
There is also something else happening this morning. Natural gas prices are moving up
AND
the price to about $6 by as early as 2015 or 2016.

Maintaining low prices is key to economic growth 
Pirog and Ratner, 12 November, Congressional Research Service, Natural Gas in the U.S. Economy:  Opportunities for Growth  Robert Pirog  Specialist in Energy Economics  Michael Ratner  Specialist in Energy Policy, http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42814.pdf 

Expanded supply, coupled with low natural gas prices, has the potential to contribute 
AND
, would need to be changed to a more market-oriented method.
Uncertainty is undermining the industry – opening OCS lands for drilling alleviates these concerns
Hayward 11 (Stephen – K. Weyerhaeuser fellow at AEI, “The gas revolution”, 4/11, http://www.aei.org/article/energy-and-the-environment/conventional-energy/the-gas-revolution/)
When Andrew Liveris took over as CEO of Dow Chemical at the end of 2004

been bit before by confident assurances that cheap gas was here to stay.
Robust domestic production is key to manufacturing growth—that’s the basis for economic recovery
Duesterberg, 12 Tom is Executive Director of the Manufacturing and Society in the

He has been on the Harvard faculty for 23 years, Professor of Management Practice. He joined the Technology and Operations Management Unit in January 2007, p. amazon kindle 

The rough and tumble of international competition means we should expect industries to come and

Domestic manufacturing is key to overall resilience
Ettlinger, 11 Michael, Vice President for Economic Policy at the Center for¶ American Progress Prior to joining the Center, he spent six years at the Economic¶ Policy Institute directing the Economic Analysis and Research Network.¶ Previously, he was tax policy director for Citizens for Tax Justice and the Institute¶ on Taxation and Economic Policy for 11 years.

Econ decline causes war 
Royal 10 (Jedediah, Director of Cooperative Threat Reduction – U.S. Department of Defense, “Economic Integration, Economic Signaling and the Problem of Economic Crises”, Economics of War and Peace: Economic, Legal and Political Perspectives, Ed. Goldsmith and Brauer, p. 213-215)
Less intuitive is how periods of economic decline may increase the likelihood of external conflict
AND
not featured prominently in the economic-security debate and deserves more attention.

Two neatly opposed scenarios for the future of the world order illustrate the range of 
AND
theocratic absolutes, competing or converging with secular absolutes such as unbridled nationalism.

O’Hanlon 12 — Kenneth G. Lieberthal, Director of the John L. Thornton China Center and Senior Fellow in Foreign Policy and Global Economy and Development at the Brookings Institution, former Professor at the University of Michigan, served as special assistant to the president for national security affairs and senior director for Asia on the National Security Council, holds a Ph.D. from Columbia University, and Michael E.

Lastly, American economic weakness undercuts U.S. leadership abroad. Other countries

Cooperative Federalism
Contention Two is Cooperative Federalism
Removing the offshore moratorium is key to reinvigorate cooperative federalism
 Weaver 2 (Sierra B., Senior Staff Attorney with Expertise in Climate Change, Forests and Public Lands, and Marine Conservation – Defenders of Wildlife (Litigation Group in Washington, DC), “NOTE: Local Management of Natural Resources: Should Local Governments be Able to Keep Oil Out?,” The Harvard Environmental Law Review, 26 Harv.

Colo. L. Rev. 1133, Lexis, 
In contrast, individuals actively involved with on-the-ground public land management 
AND

Supreme Court is key – creates a trickle-down effect
Aroney 6 (Nicholas – Senior Lecturer in Law, T.C. Beirne School of Law and Fellow, Centre for Public, International and Comparative Law, The University of Queensland, Australia, “Formation, Representation and Amendment in Federal Constitutions”, 2006, lexis)

A further complicating factor is that the powers allocated by the four constitutions under consideration 
AND
solicitous of the interests of the States than it used to be. n100
Now is key – Court decisions clarify legal doctrine and set precedent
Burce 8 (Simon B. – Solicitations Editor, BOSTON COLLEGE ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS LAW REVIEW, 2007-08, “WILD RIVERS AND THE BOUNDARIES OF COOPERATIVE FEDERALISM: THE WILD AND SCENIC RIVERS ACT AND THE ALLAGASH WILDERNESS WATERWAY”, 2008, 35 B.C. Envtl. Aff. L. Rev. 77, lexis)

provincial autonomy, empowerment and rights of the provinces over their natural resources?
Pakistan collapse causes global nuclear conflict – draws in China, India and Russia
Pitt 9 (William - a New York Times and internationally bestselling author of two books: &amp;#34;War on Iraq: What Team Bush Doesn&amp;#39;t Want You to Know&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;The Greatest Sedition Is Silence.&amp;#34;, “Unstable Pakistan Threatens the World,” 5/8, http://www.arabamericannews.com/news/index.php?mod=articleandcat=commentaryandarticle=2183) 
But a suicide bomber in Pakistan rammed a car packed with explosives into a jeep 
AND

Pakistan’s economy is collapsing – federalist issues are key 
Stokes 13 (Bruce – Director of Global Economic Attitudes, Pew Research Center, “Seeds of Unrest in Pakistan&amp;#39;s Economy “, 2/7, http://www.pewglobal.org/2013/02/07/seeds-of-unrest-in-pakistans-economy/)
The news out of Pakistan is unrelentingly bad. Terrorist bombings have become a regular 
AND
a warning sign of waning investor confidence and a deteriorating international economic situation.
Pakistan-modeled federalism promotes economic growth – solves terrorism and Indo-Pak nuclear war
Sokolski 9 (Henry, Executive Director of the Nonproliferation Policy Education Center, “PAKISTAN’S NUCLEAR FUTURE: REINING IN THE RISK,” Strategic Studies Institute, December, http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/pub963.pdf)
With any attempt to assess security threats, there is a natural tendency to focus 
AND
and ethnic and religious groups, Washington is in no position to help. 
Pakistani economic collapse causes nuclear and bio war 
Walayat 10 (Nadeem, Editor – Market Oracle, “Pakistan Collapse Could Trigger Global Great Depression and World War III”, The Market Oracle, 1-16, http://www.marketoracle.co.uk/Article16543.html)  

During 2009 the 2600 terrorist attacks resulted in the number of deaths soaring to more 
AND

Biowar causes extinction 
Sandberg et al 8—Research Fellow at the Future of Humanity Institute at Oxford University. PhD in computation neuroscience, Stockholm—AND—Jason G. Matheny—PhD candidate in Health Policy and Management at Johns Hopkins. special consultant to the Center for Biosecurity at the University of Pittsburgh—AND—Milan M. Ćirković—senior research associate at the Astronomical Observatory of Belgrade. Assistant professor of physics at the University of Novi Sad. (Anders, How can we reduce the risk of human extinction?, 9 September 2008, http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/features/how-can-we-reduce-the-risk-of-human-extinction)
The risks from anthropogenic hazards appear at present larger than those from natural ones. 
AND
may increase as biotechnologies continue to improve at a rate rivaling Moore&amp;#39;s Law.
Deterrence will fail 
Perkovich, 11/13/2012 (George – Vice President for Studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, The Non-Unitary Model And Deterrence Stability In South Asia, p. http://carnegieendowment.org/2012/11/13/non-unitary-model-and-deterrence-stability-in-south-asia/eihm#)
Social scientists have observed, of course, that complex systems such as states are 
AND
“Normal” models of deterrence do not hold in such a situation.
Indo/Pak war goes nuclear
Hundley, 9/5/2012 (Tom – Pulitzer Center staff, Pakistan and India: Race to the End, Pulitzer Center, p. http://pulitzercenter.org/reporting/pakistan-nuclear-weapons-battlefield-india-arms-race-energy-cold-war)
Nevertheless, military analysts from both countries still say that a nuclear exchange triggered by

Only a full SPR gets credit in the market.

Klare 2002 (Michael – board of directors of the Arms Control Association, the National Council of the Federation of American Scientists, and the advisory board of the Arms Division of Human Rights Watch, Resource Wars: The New Landscape of Global Conflict, p. 27-29)
Of all the resources discussed in this book, none is more likely to provoke 
AND
conflict, however minor, will automatically generate a risk of outside intervention.
An oil shock collapses consumer spending, causes inflation and raises interest rates ~-~-- that results in a global economic collapse.
Rubin, 1/26/2011 (Jeffrey – former chief economist at CIBC Word Market, How Do Oil Shocks Cause Recessions?, Huffington Post, p. http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jeffrey-rubin/how-do-oil-shocks-cause-r_b_813627.html)
