==== And the security system is so successful it has made itself redundant. The State only exists to guard against the possibility of threat, which really is the possibility of a possibility of something bad happening.

__The nuclear is at once the culminating point of available energy and the maximization of energy control systems.__ __Lockdown and control increase in direct proportion to__ (__and undoubtedly even faster than) liberating potentialities. This was already the aporia of the modern revolution. It is still the absolute paradox of the nuclear. Energies freeze in their own fire, they deter themselves.__ __One can no longer imagine what project, what power__, what strategy, what subject __could exist behind this enclosure, this vast saturation of a system by its own forces, now neutralized,__ __unusable, unintelligible, nonexplosive__ __- except for the possibility of an explosion toward the center, of an implosion where all these energies would be abolished in a catastrophic process (in the literal sense, that is to say in the sense of a reversion of the whole cycle toward a minimal point, of a reversion of energies toward a minimal threshold).__

And yet __there are no proofs of this reality&amp;#39;s existence - and there never will be__ - any more than there are proofs of the existence of God__. It is, like God, a matter of faith. And when you begin to believe in it, this is because it is already disappearing.__

__It is when one is no longer sure__ of the existence of God, __or when one has lost the naive faith in a self-evident reality, that it becomes absolutely necessary to believe__ in it. __We invested reality with the whole of our imaginary, but it is this imaginary that is vanishing__, __since we no longer have the energy to believe in it.__

__Henceforth we must believe in it. As doubt sets in everywhere, as a product of the failure of the systems of representation, reality becomes an absolute imperative__; it becomes __the foundation of__ a __moral order. But neither things nor people obey__ a reality principle or a moral imperative.

For Baudrillard, this is a consequence of the disappearance of causes and the power of effects. It reflects something deeper__: the world is held collectively responsible for the system.__ __If the system is infringed, the world will have to be destroyed. Or rather, we are ‘psychologically programmed to destroy ourselves’ if the system collapses. We could think of this as the code blackmailing reality.__ __Though the code is tautological and does not depend on reality, it holds reality responsible for itself, and punishes reality if it collapses or crashes__.

(% class=&amp;#34;MsoNormal&amp;#34; %)
This generalisation of responsibility can be traced back to the loss of symbolic exchange. __Generalised, unlimited responsibility occurs because nothing is exchanged anymore, the terms of exchange are simply exchanged among themselves.__ __The system produces nothing but vertigo and fascination. Generalised responsibility becomes the same as generalised irresponsibility and the collapse of social relations.__ __Values such as responsibility, justice and violence continue to circulate only as simulations imposed by the state. This in turn is fatal for the ‘scene’ of politics.__

==== The system is confronted by the soul. It is our choice of disorganization that challenges systems of control with the inexpressibility of a life that refuses to be reduced to a productive subject. Redeems humanity. ====

__It was the “unexchangeable depth” of the soul which ultimately eluded the code of everyday signs, __spectacularly so in the case of Nietzsche__. “For it is gregariousness that presupposes exchange, the communicable, language: being equivalent to something else, namely, to anything that contributes to the conservation of the species, to the endurance of the herd, but also to the endurance of the signs of the species in the individual__” (Klossowski: 60). But __what is exchanged, what can be made equivalent__ (what, to take up Baudrillard’s terms, can enter into the domain of or a relation of value) __is never the fundamental impulses of the soul.__ Thus Klossowski wonders: __“Is everything that is singular, incommunicable and unexchangeable (that is, everything that is excluded from what we call the norm) not only condemned to muteness, but also condemned to disappear, or at least to remain ‘unconscious’?”__ (Ibid.). __It would appear so. The eternal return__, Nietzsche’s both Nietzsche’s most fantastic phantasm and simulacrum, __is the mark of his singular profundity: “Now since it was a question of a high tonality of soul, __Nietzsche maintained that __its thought attested to his own singularity: the unintelligible depth remained the criterion of the unexchangeable__” (Ibid.:72). __The unexchangeable itself also remains the criterion of uniqueness: “The obsession with authenticity, namely, with his unexchangeable and irreducible depth, and all his efforts to attain i__t – this is what constituted Nietzsche’s primary and ultimate preoccupation. __Hence__ his feeling of __not having been born yet__” (Ibid.:140__). Though the possibility remains of recognition of others of similar character or spirit __– compare the “unexchangeable (non-communicable) character of certain ways of living, thinking and feeling” (Ibid.:127) with the restricted “everyday codes” evolved by certain individuals (Ibid.:5) __– it is the singular and unexchangeable character of an existence that defines it. Discussing the “fecund” individuals which Nietzsche hopes to bring forth, and which alone would justify the existence of the species, Klossowski reminds that “this overabundance of the fecund individual soul is something unexchangeable and hence without price”__ (Ibid.:153).

All the same, __we should try to get beyond the moral imperative of unconditional respect for__ human __life__, __and conceive that one might respect__, both in the other and in oneself, __something other__ than, and more than, life (existence isn’t everything, it is even the least of things): __a destiny__, a cause, a form of pride or of sacrifice. __There are symbolic stakes which far exceed existence and freedom - which we find it unbearable to lose, because we have made them the fetishistic values of a universal humanist order. __So we cannot imagine a terrorist act committed with entire autonomy and ‘freedom of conscience’. Now, choice in terms of symbolic obligations is sometimes profoundly mysterious - as in the case of Romand, the man with the double life, who murdered his whole family, not for fear of being unmasked, but for fear of inflicting on them the profound disappointment of discovering his deception. 3 Committing suicide would not have expunged the crime from the record; he would merely have passed the shame off on to the others. Where is the courage, where the cowardice? __The question of freedom, one’s own or that of others, no longer poses itself in terms of moral consciousness, and a higher freedom must allow us to dispose of it to the point of abusing or sacrificing it.__ Omar Khayyam: ‘Rather one freeman bind with chains of love than set a thousand prisoned captives free.’ Seen in that light, __this is almost an overturning of the dialectic of domination, a paradoxical inversion of the master-slave relationship. In the past, the master was the one who was exposed to death, and could gamble with it. The slave was the one deprived__ of death and destiny, the one doomed to survival and labour. How do things stand today? __We, the powerful, sheltered now from death and overprotected on all sides, occupy exactly the position of the slave; whereas those whose deaths are at their own disposal, and who do not have survival as their exclusive aim, are the ones who today symbolically occupy the position of master__.

==== Contention four – Baudrillard isn’t just fancy talk ====

==== Here’s your piece of context – imagining the worst case scenario helps us recognize our anxieties as overblown and survivable. Think of the aff as a cognitive strategy to deal with nuclear terror ====

**Adams** Stephanie, therapist runs Beginnings Counseling and Consulting, Overcoming Anxiety Through the Power of the Worst-Case Scenario, http:~/~/www.selfgrowth.com/articles/overcoming-anxiety-through-the-power-of-the-worst-case-scenario

(% class=&amp;#34;MsoNormal&amp;#34; %)
As you’ve already guessed, this is __the “Worst-Case Scenario” Strategy.__ You may have already worked with a variation on this technique; it isn’t necessarily new. But after dealing with a high volume of anxiety clients, I’ve become able to explain it in a series of simple steps. There are only two steps, so if you want to escape the pain of anxiety, you can’t afford not to read on.

(% class=&amp;#34;MsoNormal&amp;#34; %)
First, __describe for yourself the worst-case scenario of the situation you fear, i.e. the source of your anxiety.__ Let’s take social anxiety as an example. If you have social anxiety, you might start feeling faint when you start thinking about being in a room with a lot of people and possibly being laughed at for something that you said.

(% class=&amp;#34;MsoNormal&amp;#34; %)
__Let’s set aside how unlikely it is__ that someone would be so rude as to laugh at you in a public setting. __When you have anxiety, it doesn’t matter whether the situation is likely.__ __The anxiety has taken control.__

(% class=&amp;#34;MsoNormal&amp;#34; %)
__Here’s how you take back that control: Step One is to ask yourself, “What’s the worst that could happen?”__

(% class=&amp;#34;MsoNormal&amp;#34; %)
You may freeze up when you hear this question__. Or, you might be nonplussed. “Are you kidding me?”__ You might say to yourself. “__I’m always thinking about this__! There’s never a time I’m not thinking about the worst that could happen!”

(% class=&amp;#34;MsoNormal&amp;#34; %)
__There’s a critical point of difference here. The worst-case scenario might consume your thoughts, but do you ever sit down with those worried thoughts and see them through to completion?__ __Anxiety wins most of the time because it’s like a constant buzz saw in the back of someone’s brain, nagging and whining. It can’t be escaped! But, at the same time, the person&amp;#39;s not really paying attention to it. They’re trying, with all their might, to ignore it.__

(% class=&amp;#34;MsoNormal&amp;#34; %)
__Although it might seem strange right now to pay attention to the thing you’ve been trying to avoid, it’s what you have to do in order to get past it. Take it out of the dark, and into the light. Examine it, and ask yourself, “What’s the worst that could happen?”__

(% class=&amp;#34;MsoNormal&amp;#34; %)
This can be a little tricky to define. It might seem like in the social anxiety scenario above, the worst-case scenario would be getting laughed at. For our purposes, that’s NOT the worst-case scenario. The laughter is actually the source of anxiety. __The worst-case scenario is the potential result of the feared action.__

(% class=&amp;#34;MsoNormal&amp;#34; %)
For the social situation above, the absolute worst-case scenario would be that you are so overcome with shame and hurt from the laughter that you drop dead then and there.

(% class=&amp;#34;MsoNormal&amp;#34; %)
Think I’m being silly? No! __The anxiety is a formidable opponent. It holds you in thrall with this idea of a horrible, undefinable evil that will happen to you. Define the evil, and it begins to lose the power, because you see it for what it is.__

(% class=&amp;#34;MsoNormal&amp;#34; %)
When you’re defining the worst-case scenario, start with the absolute worst and go up from there. Some lesser (but still significant) fears might be that you start crying, blushing or become unable to speak.

(% class=&amp;#34;MsoNormal&amp;#34; %)
After you’ve come up with some potential challenges, (Step One) there is one more step that is essential. You won’t overcome the anxiety without this step, so please, see it through to completion.

(% class=&amp;#34;MsoNormal&amp;#34; %)
__Here’s Step Two: figure out how you will get through the worst-case scenario.__

(% class=&amp;#34;MsoNormal&amp;#34; %)
The key word here is you. You are the only one who can defeat the anxiety. Focus on your own unique abilities and strengths. __Anxiety tries to win by taking your power away.__ __So think about how you will take that power back.__

(% class=&amp;#34;MsoNormal&amp;#34; %)
Using the example again, take a social anxiety sufferer. Imagine the worst-case scenario with that person: getting laughed at for something they said, and subsequently dropping dead. How can they overcome that experience?

(% class=&amp;#34;MsoNormal&amp;#34; %)
Well, after this they’re not going to be worrying anymore, are they?

(% class=&amp;#34;MsoNormal&amp;#34; %)
Please understand me. I&amp;#39;m not trying to be flippant! But I do firmly believe that __overcoming anxiety revolves around survival. You have to know that can get through anything. It may be painful, it may have awful consequences, but YOU – powerful YOU – will get through it.__

(% class=&amp;#34;MsoNormal&amp;#34; %)
Just for the sake of having a little bit more to work with, let’s go with a slightly less intense worst-case scenario. This time, after being laughed at, the person becomes paralyzed, unable to speak. Embarrassing, certainly. But unmanageable? Definitely not.

(% class=&amp;#34;MsoNormal&amp;#34; %)
What could this person do to get through it? If they’re unable to speak, they can’t really joke back. But they could shrug their shoulders. They could wave the laughter off, and go text a friend for support. They have options. __Anxiety doesn’t end their choices. Really, it only expands them.__

==== Ignorance is a philosophically cogent position. Admitting it creates the humility necessary to create wisdom - it’s a better style of thinking. ====

(% class=&amp;#34;MsoNormal&amp;#34; %)
__We have no such slide, unfortunately.__ But in defense of Socrates, __humility is the foundation of the fox style of thinking and much research suggests it is an essential component of good judgment in our uncertain world. It is practical. Over the long term, it yields better calibrated probability judgments, which should help you affix more realistic odds than your competitors on policy bets panning out.__
