Combating proliferation with US leadership: Reactor safety itself notwithstanding, many argue that the

reactors are mitigated and concerns over the widespread distribution of nuclear fuel allayed.

SCENARIO 1 – Prolif
Prolif is on the brink – expanding push for nuclear energy globally makes it a unique risk
Bengelsdorf et al, 2007 (Harold, held numerous senior positions in the U.S. government, including the Energy Department and its predecessor agencies, the State Department, and the U.S. Mission to the IAEA; Fred McGoldrick, served in the Department of Energy and State Department working on Nonproliferation; Michael Shwartz, a Principal with the Washington, D.C. based consulting firm of Energy Resources International, Inc.; “The U.S. Domestic Civil Nuclear Infrastructure and U.S. Nonproliferation Policy”, American Council on Global Nuclear Competitiveness, May, http://www.nuclearcompetitiveness.org/images/COUNCIL_WHITE_PAPER_Final.pdf)

What we do know, however, is this: the domestic nuclear industry in 
AND
security standpoint, but also from a mindset of preserving the nonproliferation agenda.
Proliferation risks nuclear war due to brinkmanship games- questions of deterrence miss the point.

Kroenig 12

First and foremost, proliferation optimists do not appear to understand contemporary deterrence theory.

incentives to convince their adversaries that nuclear weapons could very well be used. 

And err aff – even if prolif doesn’t cause conflict 99% of the time – 1% means extinction
Knopf 2002  (Jeffrey, Department of National Security Affairs at the Naval Postgraduate School, “Recasting the proliferation optimism-pessimism debate”, Security Studies, October, Vol. 12, Issue 1)

Optimists and pessimists have increasingly sought to conform their work to standard social science procedures
AND
deterrence theory of optimists receives more support than the decisionmaking theory of pessimists. 
SCENARIO 2 – Accidents 

Current Nuclear Renaissance risks meltdowns – NRC failures and reactor safety
Gronlund et al, 2007 (Lisbeth, co-director and senior scientist of the UCS Global Security Program; David Lochbaum, director of the nuclear safety project in the UCS Global Security Program; Edwin Lyman, senior staff scientist in the UCS Global Security Program; “Nuclear Power in a Warming World”, Union of Concerned Scientists, December, http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/nuclear_power/nuclear-power-in-a-warming-world.pdf)

Safety problems remain despite a lack of serious accidents. A serious nuclear power accident

problems so extensive that a year or more is needed to fix them.

Reactor meltdowns cause extinction

We are losing the tech race now.  Failure to maintain nuclear leadership risks prolif, conflicts, and meltdowns – cedes nonprolif and nuclear safety to the next developer

America’s nuclear energy industry is in decline. Low natural gas prices, financing hurdles

An SMR lead revival of the industry restores US nuclear leadership which controls proliferation risks

For at least the past five years, the federal government has been pushing utility

Internet, and effectively without any protection, is insanity at its finest.”

D/O/D bases are vulnerable to grid disruptions which destroys command infrastructure – only SMR’s can solve – alternatives risk cyber-attacks and terrorism

Second is Tech Leadership 

Tech Leadership key to Heg – our ev explains the last five centuries of global hegemons
Drezner 1 (Daniel Drezner (professor of international politics at The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University) 2001 “State structure, technological leadership and the maintenance of hegemony”http://www.danieldrezner.com/research/tech.pdf)
 
In this decade, proponents of globalization argue that because information and capital are mobile
AND
leading to a period of strife until a new hegemonic power is found.

Hegemony is key to prevent the escalation of global hotspots- retrenchment causes bickering internationally over leadership and prevents cooperation
Zbigniew K. Brzezinski (CSIS counselor and trustee and cochairs the CSIS Advisory Board. He is also the Robert E. Osgood Professor of American Foreign Policy at the School of Advanced International Studies, Johns Hopkins University, in Washington, D.C. He is cochair of the American Committee for Peace in the Caucasus and a member of the International Advisory Board of the Atlantic Council. He is a former chairman of the American-Ukrainian Advisory Committee. He was a member of the Policy Planning Council of the Department of State from 1966 to 1968; chairman of the Humphrey Foreign Policy Task Force in the 1968 presidential campaign; director of the Trilateral Commission from 1973 to 1976; and principal foreign policy adviser to Jimmy Carter in the 1976 presidential campaign.

For if America falters, the world is unlikely to be dominated by a single

policy ~-~- or start bracing itself for a dangerous slide into global turmoil.

No Alternatives – a collapse of U.S. hegemony would lead to an apolar world order with devastating consequences

powers would benefit from such a not-so-new world disorder.

No risk of their heg bad turns~-~--US engagement and reintervention are inevitable~-~--it’s only a question of making it effective

In theory, the United States could refrain from intervening abroad. But, in

in the kind of international system that American power has built and defended. 

PLAN TEXT: United States Federal Government should offer power purchase agreements for small modular nuclear reactors to supply power to military bases in the United States.


SOLVENCY 

Power Purchasing Agreements allow the DOD to act as a first mover jumpstarting the SMR industry

Thus far, this paper has reviewed two of DOD’s most pressing energy vulnerabilities—
AND
leadership would likely have a profound effect on the industry’s timeline and trajectory.

Only DOD action can create widespread adoption of SMR’s which saves the domestic nuclear industry

Problematically, despite the immense energy security benefits that would accompany the wide-scale
