2- Transgression Turn&#xD;
A) Transgression is almost exclusively a masculine practice.  It is a fantasy that excludes women as reciprocal subjects&#xD;
Tauchert ~’08&#xD;
~~[Ashley, Head of the English Department in the School of Arts, Languages and Literatures at the University of Exeter, Critical Quarterly, vol. 50, no. 1, April, pp. 113-114 (online at Wiley InterScience journal collection)~~]&#xD;
&#xD;
Transgression has revealed itself to be an almost exclusively masculine critical preoccupation. Transgression as &#xD;
AND&#xD;
the best – or only – way we might order our critical work.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
B) This directly undermines the radicality of their gesture—not only by proving that they actually situate the subject more than transgressing it, but also by exposing the hypocrisy of their critical distance&#xD;
Surkis ~’96 &#xD;
(Julia, No Fun and Games Until Someone Loses an Eye: Transgression and Masculinity in Bataille and Foucault &#xD;
 Diacritics 26.2 (1996) 18-30)&#xD;
&#xD;
An analysis of the gendered positions inscribed in Bataille~’s theory of transgression calls into question &#xD;
AND&#xD;
simultaneous appearance of the limit and its transgression? Who loses an eye? &#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
Always a value to life&#xD;
[[Augustine-http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/keith_augustine/]] 2k	&#xD;
Keith, &amp;#34;Death and the Meaning of Life&amp;#34; http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/features/2000/augustine1.html &#xD;
&#xD;
These considerations show that we must create our own meaning for our lives regardless of &#xD;
AND&#xD;
as the value that we find in living and thus would be irrelevant.&#xD;
&#xD;
3- The critique is ivory tower elitism – only the rich and powerful can afford to expend without reserve. &#xD;

One could raise an analogous criticism of Bataille~’s treatment of potlatch—the public, &#xD;
AND&#xD;
effect humiliated. Through such acts, their lowly social rank is reaffirmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
4- Bataille is wrong - the world~’s supply of energy and resources is finite and is being consumed rapidly now, risking extinction.&#xD;
Tverberg, 07 (Gail E., fellow of the Casualty Actuarial Society and a Member of the American Academy of Actuaries, writes for Contingency magazine and TheOilDrum.com, &amp;#34;Our world is finite: Is this a problem?&amp;#34; Energy Bulletin/Our Finite World, [[http://www.energybulletin.net/node/29117-http://www.energybulletin.net/node/29117]])&#xD;
&#xD;
We all know the world is finite. The number of atoms is finite, and these atoms combine to form a finite number of molecules. The mix of molecules may change over time, but in total, the number of molecules is also finite.&#xD;
We also know that growth is central to our way of life. Businesses are &#xD;
AND&#xD;
find substitutes, we have mostly managed to trade one problem for another:&#xD;
&#xD;
No root cause&#xD;

In this chapter and in the six preceding chapters I have examined a number of &#xD;
AND&#xD;
the roots of war and developing strategies for grassroots movements to uproot them.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
5- Bataille~’s notions of subjectivity are consistent with Nazism – lead to extinction&#xD;

This notion of the modern, Cartesian subject qua the radical negativity of the double &#xD;
AND&#xD;

&#xD;
&#xD;
6- Their theory of expenditure is reductionist—pure expenditure is not possible&#xD;
Boldt-Irons, 1995 ~~[Leslie Anne, On Bataille: Critical Essays~~]&#xD;
Arkady Plotnitsky takes as his point of departure Bataille~’s notion of expenditure when he asks &#xD;
AND&#xD;
sovereign operations which he describes always involve more than mere waste or expenditure.&#xD;
&#xD;
You are the appropriation of Bataille that he so strenuously resisted—by attempting to make the argument accessible and fit into debate you turn yourself by putting Bataille &amp;#34;to work&amp;#34;&#xD;
DeBoer Jason 1999, literary and philosophical writer &amp;#34;Bataille versus Theory&amp;#34; &amp;#34;[[http://www.sauer-thompson.com/essays/Bataille%20Versus%20Theory,%20an%20essay%20by%20Jason%20DeBoer.doc-http://www.sauer-thompson.com/essays/Bataille Versus Theory, an essay by Jason DeBoer.doc]]&amp;#34;&#xD;
Georges Bataille organizes his writings around many core concepts or ideas, many of which &#xD;
AND&#xD;
arena of thought that I wish to examine the contemporary state of theory.&#xD;
&#xD;
7- &#xD;
A) Bataille~’s critique glorifies primitivism&#xD;
Richard Wolin, 2004, Distinguished Professor of History and Comparative Literature at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, &#xD;
~~[&amp;#34;&amp;#34;Left Fascism: Georges Bataille and the German Ideology,&amp;#34; The Seduction of Unreason: The Intellectual Romance with Fascism from Nietzsche to Postmodernism, Published by Princeton University Press, ISBN 9781400825967, p. 169-170 // BATMAN~~]&#xD;
But problems exist with Bataille~’s use of ethnographic literature on sacrifice and the gift. &#xD;
AND&#xD;
, through its experience on a collective level, ~’modern~’ sterile bourgeois society.&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
B) That kills 5.9 billion people&#xD;
Andrew Flood, Irish anarchist writer, 2005&#xD;
~~[&amp;#34;Is primitivism realistic? An anarchist reply to John Zerzan and others,&amp;#34; Anarkismo, December 1^^st^^, Available Online at http://www.anarkismo.net/newswire.php?story_id=1890, Accessed 02-11-2009~~]&#xD;
I~’ll summarise my argument from the previous essay. Primitivism generally argues that the development &#xD;
AND&#xD;
can~’t convince themselves then why do they think they can convince everyone else?&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
8- Expenditure is not transgressive- limitless consumption is useless theory&#xD;
Paul Mann, 1999, &amp;#34;The Exquisite Corpse of Georges Bataille&amp;#34; in Masocriticism, p. 67-9&#xD;
I would like at one and the same time to affirm this model and to &#xD;
AND&#xD;
theory itself as death. Of theory-death. A double fatality.&#xD;
&#xD;
10- Bataille~’s obsessive focus with the extremes of humanity engages in a form of reductionism that ignores the bulk of human potential, limiting the insight that they can provide about subjectivity&#xD;
Tauchert ~’08&#xD;
~~[Ashley, Head of the English Department in the School of Arts, Languages and Literatures at the University of Exeter, Critical Quarterly, vol. 50, no. 1, April, pp. 116-117 (online at Wiley InterScience journal collection)~~]&#xD;
&#xD;
Transgression has revealed an abiding longing for ~’continuity~’ glimpsed in ~’limit conditions~’ outside &#xD;
AND&#xD;
with their own excrement. ~~[Carter~~]343&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
11- Bataille is sick and twisted&#xD;
Paul Mann, 1999, &amp;#34;The Afterlife of the Avant-Garde&amp;#34; in Masocriticism, p. 15-6&#xD;
In their own way, Bataille~’s ideas are at least as troubling as Sade~’s. &#xD;
AND&#xD;
and, if so, one might well be troubled by his writing.&#xD;
&#xD;

Turn – vanishing Indian discourse – claims of genocide are reductionist and ignore internal strife that destroys culture – it denies indigenous persons the right to take responsibility over their own lives&#xD;

&#xD;
I do believe that if any word can be used to describe our people and &#xD;
AND&#xD;
us from the truth behind the evil intentions of the crooked tribal politicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
Turn – noble savage discourse – the negative romanticizes the idea of an authentic existence – where humans become one with the land through a connection with the native identity. When the idealized Indian image turns out to be false, the radical left destroys real Indians in favor of the false image.&#xD;

A. The negative wants to become Indian, wants to be perceived as victim, but doesn~’t want to bear the real costs associated with genocide – this is an example of what Sherman Alexie calls &amp;#34;Indian loving.&amp;#34; The Left will seize upon the negative to revive multiculturalism&#xD;

A) Transgression is almost exclusively a masculine practice.  It is a fantasy that excludes women as reciprocal subjects&#xD;
Tauchert ~’08&#xD;
~~[Ashley, Head of the English Department in the School of Arts, Languages and Literatures at the University of Exeter, Critical Quarterly, vol. 50, no. 1, April, pp. 113-114 (online at Wiley InterScience journal collection)~~]&#xD;
&#xD;
Transgression has revealed itself to be an almost exclusively masculine critical preoccupation. Transgression as &#xD;
AND&#xD;
had ~’a raging hard-on~’; his ~’intensities gone wild~’: &#xD;
&#xD;
	There is a homoerotic subtext of anal penetration . . . ~~[c~~]ircles of men then&#xD;
	. . . ~~[i~~]ntensities of prostitution, homosexuality, ultimately equivalent . . .&#xD;
	an orgy of exchange . . . homosexual fellation: a cosmic circle jerk.332&#xD;
&#xD;
I wonder if the ~’intensities~’ of prostitution really are equivalent to homosexuality? It &#xD;
AND&#xD;
the best – or only – way we might order our critical work.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
B) This directly undermines the radicality of their gesture—not only by proving that they actually situate the subject more than transgressing it, but also by exposing the hypocrisy of their critical distance&#xD;
Surkis ~’96 &#xD;
(Julia, No Fun and Games Until Someone Loses an Eye: Transgression and Masculinity in Bataille and Foucault &#xD;
 Diacritics 26.2 (1996) 18-30)&#xD;
&#xD;
An analysis of the gendered positions inscribed in Bataille~’s theory of transgression calls into question &#xD;
AND&#xD;
simultaneous appearance of the limit and its transgression? Who loses an eye? &#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
The aesthetic world inevitably strives for perfection: this goal leads to the erasure of difference in preparation for the universal flow of capital. The coercive nature of art creates the necessary smooth space for capitalist domination.&#xD;
&#xD;
Castronovo 03 ~~[Russ, &amp;#34;Geo-Aesthetics: Fascism, Globalism, and Frank Norris&amp;#34; boundary 2, Fall 2003~~]&#xD;
&#xD;
The world circulation of commodities pivots on aesthetic criteria. Overproduction in the West finds &#xD;
AND&#xD;
whole and perfect in the end because each is a totalizing experience, condensing&#xD;
East and West into the unitary kernel of one big market.&#xD;
&#xD;
6- Their theory of expenditure is reductionist—pure expenditure is not possible&#xD;
Boldt-Irons, 1995 ~~[Leslie Anne, On Bataille: Critical Essays~~]&#xD;
Arkady Plotnitsky takes as his point of departure Bataille~’s notion of expenditure when he asks &#xD;
AND&#xD;
sovereign operations which he describes always involve more than mere waste or expenditure.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
Aestheticized politics destroy subjectivity by taking egalitarianism to its limit: where everything is included, no differentiation is possible. This form of forced homogeneity destroys agency and denies v2l. &#xD;

A) Bataille~’s critique glorifies primitivism&#xD;

But problems exist with Bataille~’s use of ethnographic literature on sacrifice and the gift. &#xD;
AND&#xD;
, through its experience on a collective level, ~’modern~’ sterile bourgeois society.&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
B) That kills 5.9 billion people&#xD;
Andrew Flood, Irish anarchist writer, 2005&#xD;

I~’ll summarise my argument from the previous essay. Primitivism generally argues that the development &#xD;
AND&#xD;
can~’t convince themselves then why do they think they can convince everyone else?&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
Nihilism freezes our consciousness and justifies brutal inactivity – even when progressive action is feasible – and asks us to forget memories of pain and suffering; this does not make the suffering disappear, rather it stops us from confronting our future.&#xD;
KETELS – 96&#xD;
~~[Violet B. – prof English Temple, former director Intellectual Heritage Program – 548 Annals 45 (lexis)~~]&#xD;

&#xD;
THE political bestiality of our age is abetted by our willingness to tolerate the deconstructing &#xD;

disposed to cast both words and memory in a condition of cryogenic dubiety? &#xD;

The search for the ought is a search for the goals of human behavior. &#xD;
AND&#xD;
human survival remains the ultimate human goal as long as there are humans.&#xD;

&#xD;
In the final analysis, then, Ashley~’s post-structuralist approach boils down to &#xD;
AND&#xD;
forever immersed in the expectation of deliverance, is manifestly unable to provide. &#xD;

8- Expenditure is not transgressive- limitless consumption is useless theory&#xD;
Paul Mann, 1999, &amp;#34;The Exquisite Corpse of Georges Bataille&amp;#34; in Masocriticism, p. 67-9&#xD;
I would like at one and the same time to affirm this model and to &#xD;
AND&#xD;
theory itself as death. Of theory-death. A double fatality.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
You are the appropriation of Bataille that he so strenuously resisted—by attempting to make the argument accessible and fit into debate you turn yourself by putting Bataille &amp;#34;to work&amp;#34;&#xD;
DeBoer Jason 1999&#xD;
literary and philosophical writer &amp;#34;Bataille versus Theory&amp;#34; &amp;#34;[[http://www.sauer-thompson.com/essays/Bataille%20Versus%20Theory,%20an%20essay%20by%20Jason%20DeBoer.doc-http://www.sauer-thompson.com/essays/Bataille Versus Theory, an essay by Jason DeBoer.doc]]&amp;#34;&#xD;
Georges Bataille organizes his writings around many core concepts or ideas, many of which &#xD;
AND&#xD;
arena of thought that I wish to examine the contemporary state of theory.&#xD;
&#xD;
5- Bataille~’s notions of subjectivity are consistent with Nazism – lead to extinction&#xD;
Slavoj Zizek, 1996, The Indivisible Remainder: An Essay on Shelling and Related Matters, p. 124-5&#xD;
This notion of the modern, Cartesian subject qua the radical negativity of the double &#xD;
AND&#xD;
perceived from the standpoint of the pre-modern ~’pagan~’ universe.42&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
3- The critique is ivory tower elitism – only the rich and powerful can afford to expend without reserve. &#xD;
Richard Wolin, Distinguished Professor of History and Comparative Literature at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, 2004&#xD;
~~[&amp;#34;&amp;#34;Left Fascism: Georges Bataille and the German Ideology,&amp;#34; The Seduction of Unreason: The Intellectual Romance with Fascism from Nietzsche to Postmodernism, Published by Princeton University Press, ISBN 9781400825967, p. 170-171 // BATMAN~~]&#xD;
One could raise an analogous criticism of Bataille~’s treatment of potlatch—the public, &#xD;
AND&#xD;
effect humiliated. Through such acts, their lowly social rank is reaffirmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
The affirmative is a form of empty, hysterical provocation that lobs impossible demands at the system so that we can feel better about ourselves without actually having anything change&#xD;
ZIZEK IN 2003 (SLAVOJ, CULTURAL CRITIC, THE PUPPET AND THE DWARF, P. 44)&#xD;
&#xD;
In the strict Lacanian sense of the term, one should thus posit that &amp;#34;&#xD;
AND&#xD;
, you stand a good chance of getting hundreds of thousands of dollars.&#xD;
&#xD;
10- Bataille~’s obsessive focus with the extremes of humanity engages in a form of reductionism that ignores the bulk of human potential, limiting the insight that they can provide about subjectivity&#xD;
Tauchert ~’08&#xD;
~~[Ashley, Head of the English Department in the School of Arts, Languages and Literatures at the University of Exeter, Critical Quarterly, vol. 50, no. 1, April, pp. 116-117 (online at Wiley InterScience journal collection)~~]&#xD;
&#xD;
Transgression has revealed an abiding longing for ~’continuity~’ glimpsed in ~’limit conditions~’ outside &#xD;
AND&#xD;
their own excrement. ~~[Carter~~]343&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
11- Bataille is sick and twisted&#xD;
Paul Mann, 1999, &amp;#34;The Afterlife of the Avant-Garde&amp;#34; in Masocriticism, p. 15-6&#xD;
In their own way, Bataille~’s ideas are at least as troubling as Sade~’s. &#xD;
AND&#xD;
and, if so, one might well be troubled by his writing.&#xD;

Churchill points out that Lemkin attached no hierarchy to these classifications because he believed that &amp;#34;the crux of what others would later call the ~’genocidal mentality~’ resides squarely in the cultural domain, and because he understood that there is ultimately no way of segregating the effects of cultural genocide from its physical and biological counterparts.&amp;#34;8&#xD;

&#xD;
When we use language which denies choice (for example, words such as should, have to, ought, mustn~’t, can~’t, supposed to, etc), our behaviors arise out of a vague sense of guilt, duty, or obligation. I consider this to be the most socially dangerous and personally unfortunate of all the ways we act when we~’re cut off from our needs.&#xD;
In Chapter 2 we saw how the concept of Amtsssprache allowed Adolf Eichmann and  his &#xD;

&#xD;
B) Time Travel&#xD;
1) Matter-Energy Concentrations Bend Time Allowing Time Travel&#xD;
Michio Kaku—Prof. Of Theoretical Physics @ NYU—1994 (Hyperspace; pg 234)&#xD;
Einstein~’s equations, we recall, state that the curvature or bending of space and time is determined by the matter-energy content ntent of the universe. It is, in fact, possible to find configurations of matter-energy powerful enough to force the bending of time and allow for time travel. However, the concentrations of matter-energy necessary to bend time backwards are so vast that general relativity breaks down and quantum corrections begin to dominate over relativity. &#xD;
 &#xD;
2) Because Time Travel Is Possible, Humans Will Find A Way To Do It&#xD;
Clifford A. Pickover—PhD in Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, associate editor for numerous scientific journals, research staff @ IBM T.J. Watson Research Center, Member of SETI League—1998 (Time: A Traveler~’s Guide; pg 248-249) &#xD;
Various researchers have proposed ways in which backward and forward time machines can be built that do not seem to violate any known laws of physics. Remember that the laws of physics tell us what is possible, not what is practical &#xD;
for humans at this point in time. The physics of time travel is still &#xD;
AND&#xD;
technology is nearly impossible, and history is filled with underestimates of technology: &#xD;
3) Time Travel Causes Infinite Repeating Loops That Destroy The Universe&#xD;
Randall—physics student @ CalTech—No Date (Time Travel - the Possibilities and Consequences; http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/alabaster/A398955)&#xD;
This theory involves two types of temporal loops. One type is the loop mentioned &#xD;
AND&#xD;
was already mentioned, infinite repeat loops may cause the universe to end.&#xD;
&#xD;
C) Particle Accelerators&#xD;
1) Humans Will Have Particle Accelerators Capable Of Reaching Disastrous Levels Before 2100&#xD;
John Leslie—emeriti professor of philosophy at the University of Guelph and a fellow @ the Royal Society of Canada—1996 (End of the World; pg 86) &#xD;
However, energies above 1011 GeV would be had well before the year 2100. &#xD;
AND&#xD;
which Hut and Rees gave as energy released by some cosmic ray collisions. &#xD;
2) High Level Particle Accelerators Would Disrupt The Stability Of Our Vacuum&#xD;
John Leslie—emeriti professor of philosophy at the University of Guelph and a fellow @ the Royal Society of Canada—1996 (End of the World; pg 86) &#xD;
How could anything as empty as vacuum ever be threatened by particle accelerators or by &#xD;
AND&#xD;
a region absolutely empty. It usually means one of two things instead: &#xD;
3) The Destruction Of Our Vacuum Would Usher In A New, Ever-Expanding Vacuum That Would Destroy All Life Forever&#xD;
John Leslie—emeriti professor of philosophy at the University of Guelph and a fellow @ the Royal Society of Canada—1996 (End of the World; pg 86-87)&#xD;
As Hut and Rees commented, it may be that ~’the vacuum state we &#xD;
AND&#xD;
bubble had expanded would suffer gravitational collapse in ~’microseconds or less.~’     &#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
D) Artificial Intelligence&#xD;
1) Humans Will Have AI Before 2030&#xD;
Stephen Webb—PhD in theoretical physics and professor at Open University-2002                                       (Where is Everybody: page 243 )&#xD;

 Stephen Webb—PhD in theoretical physics and professor at Open University-2002                                       (Where is Everybody: page 249 )&#xD;

AND&#xD;
Alien loose on the cosmos is a whole new level of ethical lapse.&#xD;

&#xD;
H) Utilitarianism &#xD;
1) Utilitarianism Provides The Best Rational Framework—All Others Fail &#xD;
Jeremy Bentham—philosopher—1948 (The Principles of Morals and Legislation; pg 1-2)  &#xD;
Nature has placed mankind under the governance of two sovereign masters, pain and pleasure&#xD;
AND&#xD;
sense, in caprice instead of reason, in darkness instead of light.&#xD;
&#xD;
2) Utilitarianism Extends To Extraterrestrials and Gives Weight To Future Events R.I. Sikora and Brian Berry—respectively: professor of philosophy @ University Of British Columbia; professor of Political Science @ Chicago University—1978 (Obligations To Future Generations; p. 101-2)&#xD;
Utilitarianism impartiality is an absolutely essential element of utilitarian morality. It ensures that utilities &#xD;
AND&#xD;
generations must be taken into account in deciding on population or resource policy.&#xD;
3) It May Seem Immoral To Allow Human Extinction, But It Also Immoral To Destroy The Universe Along With Countless Alien Civilizations. This Is Why We Must Use Utility In Our Decisions.&#xD;
Philip Pettit—professor of Philosophy @ Australia National University—1991 (A Companion to Ethics, ed. By Peter Singer; pg 234)&#xD;
It is usually said against consequentialism that it would lead an agent to do horrendous &#xD;
AND&#xD;

Although the dangers of careless military activism are easy to imagine, the cost of passivity is more difficult to discern. In the 1990s, the Vietnam syndrome helped delay and limit U.S. military intervention in the Balkans. Those delays and limits extended murderous Serbian repression and actually accelerated ethnic cleansing in Kosovo. Failure to intervene militarily often permits humanitarian crises to continue and leads to more dangerous conflicts. &#xD;

On the contrary, the evidence is that during interglacial periods over the last 3 million years the risks are on the temperature downside, not the upside.

On the contrary, the evidence is that during interglacial periods over the last 3 million years the risks are on the temperature downside, not the upside.

&#xD;
Your Spencer ev is bad – two reasons&#xD;
(1) Not conclusive – only says that squo regulatory environment will hinder and gives a few ways to fix it – does NOT make the claim that these changes are enough to cause wide-spread SMR adoption – zero spread-over solvency for their other advantages&#xD;
(2) Your ev goes neg – the next paragraph says there are multiple other bills and subsidies that are already messing up the SMR market – zero solvency&#xD;
~~~~JCCC EV STARTS HERE~~~~&#xD;
While some designs are closer to market introduction than others, the fact is that America~’s regulatory and policy environment is not sufficient to support a robust expansion of existing nuclear technologies, much less new ones. New reactor designs are difficult to license efficiently, and the lack of a sustainable nuclear waste management policy causes significant risk to private investment.&#xD;
Many politicians are attempting to mitigate these market challenges by offering subsidies, such as &#xD;
AND&#xD;
years and defer significant research and development costs from industry to the taxpayer.&#xD;
The problem with this approach is that it ignores the larger systemic problems that create the unstable marketplace to begin with. These systemic problems generally fall into three categories:&#xD;
Licensing. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is ill prepared to build the &#xD;
AND&#xD;
, which then undermines long-term progress, competition, and innovation.&#xD;
Nuclear Waste Management. The lack of a sustainable nuclear waste management solution is perhaps &#xD;
AND&#xD;
could contribute greatly to an economically efficient and sustainable nuclear waste management strategy.&#xD;
~~~~JCCC EV STOPS HERE~~~~&#xD;
Government Intervention. Too many policymakers believe that Washington is equipped to guide the nuclear &#xD;
AND&#xD;
cost and risk of a more mature technology that already dominates the marketplace.&#xD;
