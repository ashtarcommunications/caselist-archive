&#xD;
Less intuitive is how periods of economic decline may increase the likelihood of external conflict&#xD;
AND&#xD;
As such the view presented here should be considered ancillary to those views. &#xD;

&#xD;
====Urban sprawl is increasing====&#xD;
&#xD;
Bare 3 (Thomas Benton III, U CT School of Law JD, 21 Va. Envtl. L.J. 455, p. 458, LN)&#xD;
Citizens are leaving the central cities for the suburbs in record numbers and have been &#xD;

====And Sakowicz 4 quantifies====&#xD;
&#xD;
Sakowicz 4 (J Celeste, Florida State U JD candidate, 19 J. Land Use %26 Envtl. Law 377, Spring, p. 382, LN)&#xD;
For the past half-century, sprawl has constituted the dominate growth pattern for &#xD;
AND&#xD;
of suburbia, followed by gradual urbanization of the intervening developed areas. 25&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
====Sprawl kills the environment – pollutes air, destroys wetlands, and disrupts ecosystems====&#xD;
&#xD;
Bare 3 (Thomas Benton III, U CT School of Law JD, 21 Va. Envtl. L.J. 455, p. 465-466, LN)&#xD;
Most authors agree that a myriad of environmental harms are caused by sprawling suburban development&#xD;
AND&#xD;
and feeding patterns are often disrupted and local wildlife may be harmed. 63&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
====Environment collapse causes extinction.====&#xD;

Irish Times 02 (7/27)&#xD;
Such pleasure is probably the least important reason why biodiversity is a good thing: &#xD;

====Sprawl increases air pollution through traffic congestion====&#xD;
&#xD;
Sakowicz 4 (J Celeste, Florida State U JD candidate, 19 J. Land Use %26 Envtl. Law 377, Spring, p. 387-388, LN)&#xD;
Traffic congestion is an adverse impact of sprawl that nearly all persons on the road &#xD;

====Air pollution causes extinction.====&#xD;
&#xD;
California Chronicle 7 (&amp;#34;Human Extinction&amp;#34;, 4/14, http://www.californiachronicle.com/articles/24238)&#xD;
The most common pattern of macroevolutionary trends is extinction. In short &amp;#34;when a &#xD;

====Brownfields are not specific. Are possible everywhere.====&#xD;
Minkus 7 (Golden Gate Law U JD candidate, 1 Golden Gate U. Envitl. L.J. 267, Summer, p. 304, LN)&#xD;
Brownfields offer a means of curbing urban sprawl and development of greenfields, undeveloped land &#xD;

====Restoring brownfields solves urban sprawl====&#xD;
Minkus 7 (Golden Gate Law U JD candidate, 1 Golden Gate U. Envitl. L.J. 267, Summer, p. 304, LN)&#xD;

====Redeveloping brownfields is the key to urban revitalization that ends urban sprawl====&#xD;
Kushner 6 (James A, Southwestern U law prof., 22 Ga. U St. U.L. Rev. 857, p. 857 LN)&#xD;
Redevelopment sites that require a clean up of toxic substances, commonly referred to as &#xD;
AND&#xD;
that might bring about urban revitalization, including the essential redevelopment of brownfields.&#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;
&#xD;
==Advantage 3: Racism==&#xD;
&#xD;
====These contaminated brownfield sites are primarily located near impoverished, people of color neighborhoods and they take a disproportionate toll from the impacts of these zones.====&#xD;
Bullard et al 8 (Robert D. Bullard, Dean of the Barbara Jordan&#xD;
AND&#xD;
Race Still Matters after all of These Years, Hein Online, MV)&#xD;
&#xD;
Despite progress in research, planning, and policy, low-income and¶ &#xD;
AND&#xD;
those districts were nearly 20% higher¶ than the national average.35&#xD;
&#xD;
====Segregation is not over yet. Brownfields represent the ongoing segregation of the black body in status quo America. The white body politic ignores these black individuals suffering as they are deemed less valuable as a result of this dichotomy.====&#xD;
**Mills 1** (Charles W. Mills, Professor of Philosophy at the University of Illinois, Chicago, 2001, &amp;#34;Faces of Environmental Racism: Confronting Issues of Global Justice (2nd ed.,), p. 84-89, MV)&#xD;
&#xD;
Segregation by law is the clearest manifestation of the physical control of the space of &#xD;
AND&#xD;
—throwaways on a throwaway population, dumping on the white body~&amp;#39;s dumpsite.&#xD;
&#xD;
====This segregation is a form deliberate colonialization that pervades international politics, making violence inevitable====&#xD;
**Bullard 8** (Robert D. Bullard, Ph.D, Environmental Justice Resource Center,_Clark Atlanta University, 7/2/08, &amp;#34;POVERTY, POLLUTION AND ENVIRONMENTAL RACISM: STRATEGIES FOR BUILDING HEALTHY AND SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES&amp;#34; http://www.ejrc.cau.edu/PovpolEj.html ~~[BGB~~]&#xD;

The United States is the dominant economic and military force in the world today. &#xD;
AND&#xD;
schools, chronic unemployment, high poverty, and overloaded health care systems. &#xD;

====Colonialism links to racism. This racism is the root cause of all violence. Outweighs a neg util calc====&#xD;
**Foucault 76** (Michel, Society Must be Defended: Lectures at the College de France, 1975-1976, p. 254-257 Trans. David Macey, MV)&#xD;
&#xD;
What in fact is racism? It is primarily a way of introducing a break &#xD;
AND&#xD;
half of the nineteenth century), except by activating the theme of racism.&#xD;
&#xD;
====By allowing the death of a certain sector of the community as a result of inaction in the face of brownfields, the state solidifies its biologization of race, this scientific approach necessitates genocide ====&#xD;
Elden  2 (Stuart, PhD of poli sci,  Boundary 2, &amp;#34;The War of Races and the Constitution of the State: Foucault~&amp;#39;s «Il faut défendre la société» and the Politics of Calculation&amp;#34; pg.146)&#xD;
      What Foucault suggests is that discourses of class have their roots in the war &#xD;
AND&#xD;
, it must also pass through racism&amp;#34; (FDS, 228).  &#xD;
Current environmental law trades the lives of minorities for profits and political expedience – America is de-facto segregated via the unequal division of environmental harm &#xD;
Bullard 99 (Robert D, Ware Distinguished Professor of Sociology and Director of the Environmental Justice Resource Center at Clark Atlanta University, &amp;#34;Dismantling environmental racism in the USA&amp;#34;, Local Environment, Feb99, Vol. 4, Issue 1, Academic Search Premier)&#xD;
The environmental protection apparatus in the USA does not provide equal protection for all communities&#xD;
AND&#xD;
, waste minimisation and cleaner production strategies as the overarching and dominant goal. &#xD;
The environmental justice movement emerged in response to environmental inequities, threats to public health, unequal protection, differential enforcement and disparate treatment received by the poor and people of colour. This movement has redefined environmental protection as a basic right. It has also emphasised pollution prevention, waste minimisation and cleaner production techniques as strategies to achieve environmental justice for all Americans without regard to race, colour, national origin or income.  &#xD;

====Tax incentives solve – sufficient to cause brownfield redevelopment.====&#xD;
Rodenberger 5 (Farah, Fordham U JD, 13 Southeastern Env. L.J. 119, Spring, p. 119, LN)&#xD;
&#xD;
Business developers may be wary of brownfields primarily because of the possibility of facing environmental &#xD;
AND&#xD;
incentives may ultimately determine the final selection of a location for a business.&#xD;
&#xD;
Companies will follow incentives – brownfield projects are highly attractive.&#xD;
Crain~&amp;#39;s Detroit Business 8 (5/5, http://crainsdetroit.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080505/SUB/805050305/-1)&#xD;
&#xD;
That demand for urban lifestyles goes perfectly with a growing agenda to rebuild brownfield sites &#xD;
AND&#xD;
in a lot of cases, it~&amp;#39;s a great way to reclaim sites.&amp;#34;&#xD;
&#xD;
Tax incentives have empirically resulted in investment in brownfield sites, but more money is needed.&#xD;
Rodenberger 5 ~~[Farah, &amp;#34;Brownfields Programs and Tax Incentives are Stimulating the Redvelopment of Brownfields Properties in North Carolina and South Carolina,&amp;#34; Southeastern Environmental Law Journal, &#xD;

The federal government estimated that federal tax incentives for site cleanups would decrease federal tax &#xD;
AND&#xD;
expects that the demand for brownfields grants will increase in the future. [[n87-http://www.lexisnexis.com/us/lnacademic/frame.do?tokenKey=rsh-20.855552.9638776937%26target=results_DocumentContent%26reloadEntirePage=true%26rand=1215547493308%26returnToKey=20_T4120198005%26parent=docview]]&#xD;
Despite these successes, between 2000 and 2003, funding for the Brownfields Program decreased &#xD;
AND&#xD;
of the Brownfields Program will likely depend on further legislative and financial support.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
====Brownfield redevelopment has empirically proven to be successful in addressing environmental injustice—it has reduced crime, increased revenues, and created jobs in previously abandoned sites.====&#xD;
**Felten 6 **(Jennifer, Former President of the Ventura County Escrow Association, &amp;#34;BROWNFIELDREDEVELOPMENT 1995-2005: AN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE SUCCESS STORY?&amp;#34;,Real Property, Probateand Trust Journal.Chicago:Winter 2006. Vol. 40, Iss. 4; pg. 679, 26 pgs, proquest)&#xD;

Hence,¶ the results of the last ten years of Brownfield redevelopment reveal many reasons &#xD;

This experience, however, does not translate directly to small parcels or those with &#xD;

ENS 5 (Environment News Service, 11/2, http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/nov2005/2005-11-02-09.asp~~%23anchor3)&#xD;
&#xD;
Since it began in 1995, EPA~&amp;#39;s brownfields program has changed the way contaminated property is perceived, addressed, and managed, Johnson says. Over the last decade the EPA~&amp;#39;s brownfields program has attracted more than %247 billion in public and private investments for the cleanup and redevelopment of brownfield properties in cities and towns across the nation, creating more than 33,000 thousand jobs. During this time, more than 7,000 properties have been assessed for environmental contamination.&#xD;

====Federal incentives remove barriers to brownfield redevelopment====&#xD;
Bartsch 1 (Charles, Senior Policy analyst Northeast-Midwest Institute, &amp;#34;Financing Brownfield Cleanup and Redevelopment,&amp;#34; online: http://www.nemw.org/brownfin.htm )&#xD;

Other public policies, while not providing direct funding or tax breaks, can play &#xD;
