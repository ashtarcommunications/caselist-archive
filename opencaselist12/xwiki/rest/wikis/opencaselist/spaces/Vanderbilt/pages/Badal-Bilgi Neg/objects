====The 1AC places a fascist restriction on human agency – we are barred from interacting with the world as anything but calculative machines. ====&#xD;
McWhorter 92 (Ladelle, Professor of Philosophy and Women~&amp;#39;s Studies at Richmond, Heidegger and the earth: Essays in environmental philosophy, Thomas Jefferson University Press, pp. 6)&#xD;
The danger of a managerial approach to the world lies not, then, in &#xD;
AND&#xD;
we have not yet dreamed, directions of which we may never dream. &#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
====But through its static, all-knowing mode, it conceals other truths. What about the other ways, the other solutions? The affirmative isolates problems from the natural world, never allowing them to be evaluated in their full and assumes that humanity has the power to control everything, creating the perception of the natural as a resource for human manipulation.====&#xD;
McWhorter 92 (Ladelle, Heidegger and the Earth Essays in Environmental Philosophy, Thomas Jefferson University Press, pg. viii)  &#xD;
In &amp;#34;Earth-Thinking and Transformation,&amp;#34; Kenneth Maly shows us ways in which &#xD;
AND&#xD;
argue, is absolutely necessary if we are to avoid destroying the earth.&#xD;
&#xD;
====Nuclear technology is the archetype and culmination of western metaphysical tradition and enframing of life world====&#xD;
Kinsella 2007 (William J, Heidegger and Being at the Hanford Reservation: Standing Reserve, Enframing, and Environmental Communication Theory; Environmental Communication Vol. 1, No. 2, November 2007, pp.194-217 Dr. William J. Kinsella is an associate professor at North Carolina State University. His work on nuclear energy communication has encompassed the areas of nuclear fusion, environmental cleanup across the US nuclear weapons complex, and commercial nuclear energy in US and global contexts.)&#xD;
To further illustrate the implications of these Heideggerian concepts for environmental communication, I now &#xD;
AND&#xD;
(1989) observes, ~&amp;#39;~&amp;#39;system rationality~&amp;#39;~&amp;#39; replaces ~&amp;#39;~&amp;#39;world rationality.~&amp;#39;~&amp;#39;&#xD;
&#xD;
====Alternative energy projects force nature to conform to human uses and desires. Nature becomes a standing resource to be exploited for human means and loses its authentic meaning. ====&#xD;
Antolick 2 (Matthew, Master of Arts Department of Philosophy University of South Florida, &amp;#34;Deep Ecology and Heideggerian Phenomenology,&amp;#34; http://etd.fcla.edu/SF/SFE0000104/antolick.pdf)&#xD;
The poet and the technician or maker both reveal. But they are different – &#xD;
AND&#xD;
thought pattern that Heidegger sees as problematic of the technological mode of thinking.&#xD;
&#xD;
====The aff~&amp;#39;s quest for energy is a literal manifestation of the standing reserve====&#xD;
&#xD;
====Tad Beckman, Professor at Harvey Mudd College, Martin Heidegger and Environmental Ethics, 2000====&#xD;
Heidegger clearly saw the development of &amp;#34;energy resources&amp;#34; as symbolic of this evolutionary &#xD;
AND&#xD;
, and conceiving of all revealing as being relevant only to human subjective needs&#xD;
&#xD;
We need to be more aware of our limits, not try to overcome them or the environmental crisis will only continue to intensify. &#xD;
Thiele 95 – Professor of Political Science at University of Florida (Leslie Paul, Timely Meditations, p.191)&#xD;
&#xD;
Ecological concerns have erupted in postmodern times largely as a result of the increasingly apparent &#xD;
AND&#xD;
conquer the earth might be abated and the opportunity for its caretaking approached.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
====The 1AC relation to the environment continues the drive for control and domination of the planet as all wildlife is reduced to a calculative value within the context of human action.  This reduces all beings to objects and renders humanity a mere resource to be consumed.====&#xD;
DeLuca 05 (Kevin Micheal, prof of comm and ecology @ U of Georgia) Thinking with Heidegger: Rethinking Environmental Theory and Practice Ethics %26 the Environment 10.1 (2005) 67-87)&#xD;
The first stasis point revolves around humanity~&amp;#39;s relation to nature. To put it plainly&#xD;
AND&#xD;
humans, also, are reduced to the service of a ravenous progress.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
====The affirmatives has become tied up in the task of developing the technological world which creates the process of enframing the world in Heidegger~&amp;#39;s term of &amp;#34;standing reserve&amp;#34; – enframing the world in terms of manipulation and a managerial approach====&#xD;
Rosemann 02 ~~[Philipp, Assistant Professor of Philosophy at the University of Dallas, Journal of the History of Philosophy 40.4, &amp;#34;Heidegger~&amp;#39;s Trancendental History&amp;#34;, 2002, SM, Accessed: 6/28/11~~]&#xD;
For Heidegger, the technological age—we could perhaps say, postmodernity 63 —&#xD;
AND&#xD;
larger system could be described as a move from substance to function. 73 &#xD;
&#xD;
====Advocating this energy policy necessarily frames nature through this technological lens. It has solely become an isolated end through the anthropocentric means of energy. This ideology diminishes the value of nature into just another tool in the shed to be exploited.====&#xD;
Spicer 2 (André, Associate Professor of Organisation Studies at Warwick Business School, &amp;#34;Technical Questions: A Review of Key Works on the Question Of Technology,&amp;#34; Ephemera: critical dialogues in organization, Vol 2, Issues 1, 64-83, [[http://www.ephemeraweb.org/journal/2-1/2-1spicer.pdf-http://www.ephemeraweb.org/journal/2-1/2-1spicer.pdf]])&#xD;
If we read Being and Time as an attempt to craft a vocabulary and ~&amp;#39;&#xD;
AND&#xD;
forth and holding-sway of the truth&amp;#34; (QCT: 28).&#xD;

==Impacts==&#xD;
&#xD;
McWhorter 92 (Professor of philosophy at Northeast Missouri State, 92. LaDelle, Heidegger and the Earth, ed: McWhorter, p. 15-16)&#xD;
When we attempt to think ecological concerns within the field of thinking opened for us &#xD;
AND&#xD;
, logos and poesis, and urgency that can yet abide in stillness.&#xD;
&#xD;
====Ontological damnation outweighs nuclear war. A slow motion nuclear war is happening now as we devour the earth and life has no meaning in their framework. ====&#xD;
Zimmerman, (Professor of Philosophy at Tulane), 94 (Michael, Contesting the Earth~&amp;#39;s Future, p.&#xD;
104). &#xD;
Heidegger asserted that human self-assertion, combined with the eclipse of being, &#xD;
AND&#xD;
species are somehow lessened because they were never &amp;#34;disclosed&amp;#34; by humanity.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
====Enframing reduces nature~&amp;#39;s value to raw materials – this is the root cause of the environmental crisis. ====&#xD;
Rohkrämer, 05 – History and Philosophy professor at Lancaster University (Thomas, How Green Were the Nazis: Martin Heidegger, National Socialism, and Environmentalism, p. 189)&#xD;
&#xD;
Why did Heidegger see &amp;#34;enframing&amp;#34; as the greatest danger? Heidegger~&amp;#39;s main concern &#xD;
AND&#xD;
technological relationships. This is no longer the earth on which man lives.&amp;#34;&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
====Technological enframing of the world is the root cause of destruction of nature. ====&#xD;
DeLuca ~&amp;#39;5 (Kevin Michael DeLuca, Associate Professor of Speech Communication and adjunct in the Institute of Ecology at the University of Georgia, &amp;#34;Thinking With Heidegger: Rethinking Environmental Theory and Practice&amp;#34;, Ethics %26 the Environment 10.1 (2005) 67-87, Project Muse)//JRC—no change&#xD;
&#xD;
Machination is unconditional controllability, the domination of all beings, the world, and &#xD;
AND&#xD;
and Being-in-the-world is replaced by &amp;#34;adventures.&amp;#34; &#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
====Politics that fails to question our consumption of resources and manipulation of the planet will cause nihilistic destruction of the planet. ====&#xD;
de Beistegui, 97 – Professor of Philosophy at the University of Warwick (Miguel, Heidegger and the Political, ed. by K. Ansell-Pearson and S. Critchely, p.71, ASG)JRC&#xD;
&#xD;
What monstrousness does Heidegger have in mind here? In what sense can technology be &#xD;
AND&#xD;
&amp;#34;experiences&amp;#34; (Erlebnisse), which he flaunts as his &amp;#34;truths.&amp;#34; &#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
==Alternative==&#xD;
Our desperate desire for constant action to seize control of a world is the very trait we must abandon if we are to progress as a people.  Thus, we do not present a specific action in favor of questioning reflection.  Our thought need not be the precursor to action – it itself is active, revealing the cycle of destruction hidden by the 1AC.&#xD;
Ladelle McWhorter, assistant professor of philosophy at Northeast Missouri State University, Heidegger and the earth, 1992, p. 2-4&#xD;
We now live with the ugly, painful, and impoverishing consequences of decades of &#xD;
AND&#xD;
also ground the most basic patterns of our current ways of being human.&#xD;
Don~&amp;#39;t let this be misconstrued by the affirmative as vague or insignificant simply because we &#xD;
AND&#xD;
alternative~&amp;#39; that will make this all go away is just another rationalist impulse.&#xD;
The belief that there is no alternative to status quo ~&amp;#39;progress~&amp;#39; forms the basis for genocidal fascism.  Cycles of violence and exploitation are perpetuated in the name of their inevitability – the ultimate conclusion to the Affirmative~&amp;#39;s logic is the suicidal destruction of the world to fulfill our dreams of saving it.&#xD;
Santos, Professor of Sociology at University of Coimbra, 2003, Bad Subjects&#xD;
According to Franz Hinkelammert, the West has repeatedly been under the illusion that it &#xD;
AND&#xD;
machine of democracy and liberty turns into a machine of horror and destruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
The only way to understand competing claims is to first understand being&#xD;
Dillon 99 (Michael Dillon, Political Theory, Vol. 27, No. 2, April 1999)&#xD;
As Heidegger—himself an especially revealing figure of the deep and mutual implication of &#xD;
AND&#xD;
demanding a reappraisal as fundamental as the reappraisal ontology has demanded of philosophy. &#xD;
In other words, whatever ontology you subscribe to, knowingly or unknowingly, as &#xD;
AND&#xD;
innocent political slaves who claim only to be the technocrats of decision making. &#xD;
And ontological inquiry comes first as it establishes the unique nature of the human being. &#xD;
&#xD;
====Tad Beckman, Professor at Harvey Mudd College, Martin Heidegger and Environmental Ethics, 2000====&#xD;
When we explore beings, things that exist, we discover that most beings are &#xD;
AND&#xD;
characteristic consciousness but they come into their own beings as objects through us.&#xD;
The alternative is not a policy action, doing nothing radically changes the political process&#xD;
AND&#xD;
precludes using urgent calls to action backed with threats to justify a policy.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
====The root cause of their harms is viewing the world as standing reserve. Suspending our urge to manage gives us a chance re-connect with ontology and break-free from this technological enframing. ====&#xD;
Best and Nocella, 06 –associate professor of philosophy at the University of Texas at El Paso (Igniting a Revolution:  Voices in Defense of the Earth, p. 82-84, google books)&#xD;
&#xD;
Yet, for both Heidegger and revolutionary environmentalists, there exist possibilities for transformation despite &#xD;
AND&#xD;
unfolds, both through revolutionary action rooted in solidarity with nature and through n&#xD;
ew, non-exploitative modes of acting in the world, technics will not disappear; instead, the limits of technology as a mode of revealing will begin to be discerned so that new forms and uses of technology can emerge.  &#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
====The argument that there~&amp;#39;s no alternative is a link—it ignores the constructed nature of sovereignty and assumes its natural—this forecloses any possibility of resistance====&#xD;
Shaw, (Professor of Poli Sci, University of Victoria), 99  (Karena, 9 Transnational Law %26 Contemporary Problems 569, lexis). &#xD;
&#xD;
The dangers of assuming sovereignty emerge from the ways in which the assumption of &#xD;
AND&#xD;
go into its production are also rendered necessary and natural rather than political. &#xD;
