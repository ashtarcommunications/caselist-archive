Morris 92 (Milton, vice president of research at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies in Washington, D.C., Washington Quarterly, Autumn, Lexis)

Economic Competition for Expanded Domestic Opportunities. Even before the breathtaking developments of the past two years, it had become clear that growing economic competition was rapidly challenging military power as the key to global leadership. The end of the Cold War has confirmed that development, because the Soviet Union, a military giant, collapsed from economic weakness. Representative Lee Hamilton (D-Ind.) notes in this regard that
Economic power is the new determinant of international stature. The restoration of U.S. competitiveness is critical not only to our domestic economy but to our foreign policy as well. Our economic problems are limiting the reach of our foreign policy at a time when the rest of the world is looking to the United States for leadership. n4

LFTR can power commercial ships. Powering ocean cargo vessels with LFTR electric power will 
AND
to oil power, it can change from oil power to LFTR power.

Certainly a reappearance of nuclear merchant ships could be excellent news for the UK shipping 
AND
, would also be one of very few competitors for lucrative new business.

A less formidable U.S. naval presence in the Persian Gulf—and 
AND
core areas of strategic interest much more costly and less likely to succeed.

Collapse of Asian trade causes nuclear war

The risk of conflict in the South China Sea is significant. China, Taiwan
AND
and intensifying bilateral strategic competition would likely make managing such a crisis more difficult
