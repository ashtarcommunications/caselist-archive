===Human Rights K – 1NC===

====The affirmative~’s appeal for &amp;#34;human rights&amp;#34; is fundamentally exclusive – it perpetuates and legitimizes speciesism====
Tittle 98 – Peg, author; former Professor of Philosophy
~~[&amp;#34;The Humanist View of Animal Rights,&amp;#34; http://tittle.humanists.net/humview.htm~~]cn
First, if humanism ~’just~’ emphasized human-as-opposed-to-god
AND
on instrumental grounds. It seems then that humanism must condone sport hunting.

====Speciesism makes possible &amp;#34;systematic beastilization,&amp;#34; which justifies non-criminal putting to death of the Other – this is the root cause of all oppression====
Rossini 6 – Manuela, Postdoctoral Fellow at Amsterdam School for Cultural Analysis
~~[Sept, &amp;#34;To the Dogs: Companion speciesism and the new feminist materialism,&amp;#34; Kritikos, Volume 3, http://intertheory.org/Rossini~~]cn
What is equally sobering, however, is the fact that the most radical metaposthumanists 
AND
means limited to its overwhelmingly direct and disproportionate effects on animals.~~[26~~]

====The alternative is to reject the affirmative and demand that &amp;#34;sentience&amp;#34; not &amp;#34;humanness&amp;#34; be the basis for rights.====

====Basing rights on sentience rather than &amp;#34;humanness&amp;#34; vacates an arbitrary standard and allows us to carry the evolution of rights out to its logical, nonspeciesist conclusion.====
Best 5 – Steven, Ph.D., Associate Professor of Philosophy and Humanities at the University of Texas El Paso
~~[&amp;#34;The New Abolitionism: Capitalism, Slavery and Animal Liberation,&amp;#34; http://www.drstevebest.org/papers/vegenvani/new_abolitionism.php~~]cn
Just as nineteenth century abolitionists sought to awaken people to the greatest moral issue of 
AND
that speciesism is another ~~[an~~] unsubstantiated form of oppression and discrimination.

====Securitizing the environment triggers prolif and great power war====
Brzoska 8 – Michael Institute for Peace Research and Security Policy at the University of Hamburg
~~[&amp;#34;The securitization of climate change and the power of conceptions of security,&amp;#34; Paper prepared for the International Studies Association Convention 2008~~]gw
In the literature on securitization it is implied that when a problem is securitized it 
AND
military preparedness against the other major powers, thus leading to arms races.


====Framing energy policy as a security issue makes environmental crisis, militarism, and extinction inevitable – investigating their epistemology must be a prior question to solvency====
Ahmed 11 – Dr. Nafeez Mosaddeq Ahmed is Executive Director of the Institute for Policy Research and Development (IPRD), an independent think tank focused on the study of violent conflict, he has taught at the Department of International Relations, University of Sussex
~~[&amp;#34;The international relations of crisis and the crisis of international relations: from the securitisation of scarcity to the militarisation of society&amp;#34; Global Change, Peace %26 Security Volume 23, Issue 3, 2011 Taylor Francis~~]gw
The twenty-first century heralds the unprecedented acceleration and convergence of multiple, interconnected 
AND
turn radicalising the processes of social polarisation that can culminate in violent conflict.

====Individual rejection creates resistance movements that challenge the dominant security paradigm====
Burke 2 – Anthony, School of Political Science and International Studies University of Queensland
~~[Aporias of Security, Alternatives 27 pg. 22-23~~]gw
It is perhaps easy to become despondent, but as countless struggles for freedom, 
AND
is a world after security, and what its shimmering possibilities might be.

====Now is key – we can~’t wait to see the added effects of wind turbines====
Subramanian 12 – Meera, Nature article
~~[June 20, &amp;#34;The trouble with turbines: An ill wind,&amp;#34; Nature.com, [[http://www.nature.com/news/the-trouble-with-turbines-an-ill-wind-1.10849~~]sr-http://www.nature.com/news/the-trouble-with-turbines-an-ill-wind-1.10849%5dsr]]
