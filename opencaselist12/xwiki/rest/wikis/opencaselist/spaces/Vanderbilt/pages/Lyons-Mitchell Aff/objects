Morris 92 (Milton, vice president of research at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies in Washington, D.C., Washington Quarterly, Autumn, Lexis)&#xD;
&#xD;
Economic Competition for Expanded Domestic Opportunities. Even before the breathtaking developments of the past two years, it had become clear that growing economic competition was rapidly challenging military power as the key to global leadership. The end of the Cold War has confirmed that development, because the Soviet Union, a military giant, collapsed from economic weakness. Representative Lee Hamilton (D-Ind.) notes in this regard that&#xD;
Economic power is the new determinant of international stature. The restoration of U.S. competitiveness is critical not only to our domestic economy but to our foreign policy as well. Our economic problems are limiting the reach of our foreign policy at a time when the rest of the world is looking to the United States for leadership. n4&#xD;
