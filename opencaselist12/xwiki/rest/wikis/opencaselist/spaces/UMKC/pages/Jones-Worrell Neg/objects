4.  Webb concludes that we should EXCLUDE programs that only have the secondary benefit of being an incentive for energy production: - THIS IS THEIR EVIDNECE 
By limiting the definition of financial incentives to initiatives where public funds are either disbursed 
AND
In effect, these programs are assistance, but they are not incentives.
     The Law Reform Commission of Canada has in earlier studies defined accountability of administrative agencies as:
•	...having to answer for the exercise of what is essentially governmental authority to affect public and private interests. The rule of law demands that governmental authority not be exercised arbitrarily, and that agencies account, sometimes within a political framework, sometimes within a legal one, and often within both, for the decisions they make and for the policies they pursue as decision makers.25

The affirmative massively increases ground 
a.  allowing anything that is related to creating a market makes command and control regulations topical – which massively increases affirmative ground including RPS, Cap and Trade, etc. and is explicitly anti-topical – allowing the aff to both increase and decrease restrictions on each energy or another energy
b.  You should exclude affs for which the main purpose is to support a non-energy objective like defense objectives – 
Support for both of these claims:
