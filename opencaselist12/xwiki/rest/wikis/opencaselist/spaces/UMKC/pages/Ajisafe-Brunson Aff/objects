Lynch 1729&#xD;
(William Lynch, “The Willie Lynch Letter and the Making of the Slave”)&#xD;
“I have a foolproof method for… respect and trust only us.”&#xD;
We are the “Black Trash” within these white spaces who are rejected because of the fear of contamination  &#xD;
Mills 01(Charles W. Mills “Black Trash” 2001 Faces of Environmental Racism: Confronting Issues of Global Justice, Second ED 84-85)&#xD;
“Only with a more realistic sense… no longer be questioned.28”&#xD;
In an attempt to break away from state-centric notions of energy policies we advocate exposing the redistribution of pollution that the resolution produces by removing restrictions on energy production in debate. We affirm that our personal and the performativity of our speech act is a form of energy production. This affirmation of personalism recognizes that we, the person, are a pre requisite to the change in energy policy. We demand that the debate space and the discourse around energy production remove its restrictions on our form of energy production.&#xD;
 True alternative energy can only come from personalism. This framing of alternative energy allows one to access the individual activating energies to impact material reality. This rebuilds culture and fuels Afrocentric consciousness which allows for the reshaping Eurocentric ontologies &#xD;
Modupe 03 (Danjuma Sinue Modupe “The Afrocentric Philosophical Perspective: A Narrative Outline” 2003)&#xD;
“The philosophical understanding which… rise to an Afrocentric consciousness.”&#xD;
 The resolution is a form of energy production that perpetuates the pollution of negative energy in communities of color. Personalism allows us to access internalized energy in order to come up with true strategies for resistance.  &#xD;

African personalists focus on total… respect for non-human life forms.”&#xD;
