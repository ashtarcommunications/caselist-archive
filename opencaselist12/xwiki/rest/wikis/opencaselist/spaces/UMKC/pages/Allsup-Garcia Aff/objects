**__Marx tends to cast capitalism …__** interpreted in these utilitarian ways. 32

 

7. The alternative teleological telling of history prioritizes a goal-oriented instrumental knowledge over the thinking of being – this does violence to the uniqueness of the past and fails to recognize the asymmetry of historical epochs

Nelson, 2k7

In **__strong teleological accounts__**, … forward from that diff erence and distance itself.

 

8. History is not a goal-oriented ‘making’ but a historically-situated response or failure to respond to being – only by rethinking metaphysical grounding can we reconstitute social and ecological relationships

The status quo legal environment sidelines questions of democratic control, accountability to the public, and legitimacy of decisions in mainstream discourse on sustainable energy production

Hendriks, 2k9

Carolyn, The Crawford School of Economics and Government – The Australia National University, //Securing Public Legitimacy for Long-Term Energy Reform//, Public Policy Network Conference – The Australian National University, Canberra, 29-30 January 2009

Despite these democratic arguments and …energy reform in the Netherlands (Hendriks 2008, 2009a, 2009b).

 

The failure to facilitate community involvement in renewable energy projects has doomed them to failure and institutionally entrenched the centralized model of conventional fossil fuels

Wolsink, 2k11

Wolsink, Maarten. &amp;#34;The research agenda on social acceptance of distributed generation in smart grids: Renewable as common pool resources.&amp;#34; Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews (2011)

**__The centralised view is institutionally anchored …__**of renewable energy generation in microgrids.

 

Centralization and technocracy are reinforced by a favorable regulatory environment that elevates large-scale, conventional utilities at the cost of local decision-making and control

Byrne, 2k3

Byrne, John, and Yu-Mi Mun. &amp;#34;Rethinking reform in the electricity sector: Power liberalisation or energy transformation.&amp;#34; Electricity reform: Social and environmental challenges (2003): 48-76

**__While power liberalisation initiatives aim … one dollar is one vote in markets__**.

 

As such, most forms of electricity generation are under the control of a small number of for-profit, corporate entities which fail to prioritize the social, economic, and environmental values held by the communities they serve

Byrne, 2k3

Byrne, John, and Yu-Mi Mun. &amp;#34;Rethinking reform in the electricity sector: Power liberalisation or energy transformation.&amp;#34; Electricity reform: Social and environmental challenges (2003): 48-76

**__While it is true that smaller-scale … of the market’s drive for efficiency__**.

 

This model of implementation and design of energy systems and policy produces exclusion and enacts structurally violence forms of social organization

Hendriks, 2k9

Carolyn, The Crawford School of Economics and Government – The Australia National University, //Securing Public Legitimacy for Long-Term Energy Reform//, Public Policy Network Conference – The Australian National University, Canberra, 29-30 January 2009

Beyond securing legitimacy, **__policy design that … __**(Gross 2007; Wüstenhagen et al. 2007), **__and nuclear waste disposal sites __**(Dawson and Darst 2006).

 

Unequal power relationships are constructed in the form of price discrimination which aggravates inequity between the rich and poorer, minority consumers and their communities by limiting the capacity to participate economically or politically

Byrne, 2k3

Byrne, John, and Yu-Mi Mun. &amp;#34;Rethinking reform in the electricity sector: Power liberalisation or energy transformation.&amp;#34; Electricity reform: Social and environmental challenges (2003): 48-76

Some researchers have raised concerns that **__…__** justice at the macro- or societal level.

 

This makes violence and instability inevitable

Champain, 2k11

Phil, Director of Programs at the peacebuilding NGO International Alert, “Changing energy provision – a peacebuilding opportunity?”

There is one thing about which we can be certain - …**__ development and security for vulnerable communities__**.

 

 

Contention Two: Community-Based Energy Production and Ownership

 

The transition to renewable energy is inevitable – it is only a question of the way it is politically and economically shaped

Champain, 2k11

Phil, Director of Programs at the peacebuilding NGO International Alert, “Changing energy provision – a peacebuilding opportunity?”

Renewables, energy provision and conflict So …**__ beyond environmental concerns to consider governance ones__**.

 

SEC registration and compliance costs restrict democratic, community-based ownership over electricity generation from renewable energy projects

Farrell, 2k8

John, Senior researcher at the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, //Broadening Wind Energy Ownership by Changing Federal Incentives//, April 5^^th^^, 2008

Cooperative Limitations Getting numerous local investors …, **__but receive some portion of the gross revenues__**.

 

And, tax liability restrictions ensure centralized, corporate control over wind and solar projects

Mendonc, 2k9

M. Mendonc¸a, et al., Stability, participation and transparency in renewable energy policy: Lessons from Denmark and the United States, Policy and Society (2009), doi:10.1016/j.polsoc.2009.01.007

Compared with emerging European renewable energy … in countries such as Germany, France and Spain.

 

Thus, the plan:

 

The United States federal government should exempt community wind and solar power projects from all registration and compliance restrictions with the Securities and Exchange Commission as well as all tax liability restrictions on eligibility for federal tax credits

 

 

SEC exemption and residential access to federal tax credits will create the framework for non-profit, community-based energy

CEEP, 2k12

Center for Energy and Environmental Policy-University of Delaware, //Politics to Support Community Solar Initiatives//, February 2012

As noted above in 6.1.7, the promising model … to community solar project developers.

 

SEC exemption for community solar would hasten the development of community-based and owned energy projects

Bailey, 2k12

Bailey, Kristin L. &amp;#34;Insecurity for Community Solar: Three Strategies to Confront an Emerging Tension between Renewable Energy Investment and Federal Securities Laws.&amp;#34; J. on Telecomm. and High Tech. L. 10 (2012): 123.

Finally, there is the question of how … accountability could attract unscrupulous actors.

 

Policies that induce community control are critical to shift entrenched discourses and organizational structures of fossil fuel energy systems away from technocracy and centralization to diversification and democratic control

Mendonc, 2k9

M. Mendonc¸a, et al., Stability, participation and transparency in renewable energy policy: Lessons from Denmark and the United States, Policy and Society (2009), doi:10.1016/j.polsoc.2009.01.007

Federal tax credits are only one piece …**__to create a stable__**, **__democratic market for all__**.

 

Community energy initiatives offer opportunities to create social ties among individuals with different backgrounds and experiences that transcend the notion of the citizen as a mere “economic actor”

Hoffman and High-Pippert, 2k9

Steven (Professor and Chair in the Department of Political Science at St. Thomas); Angela (Associate Professor in the Department of Political Science at St. Thomas), //From Private Lives to Collective Action: Recruitment and Participation Incentives for a Community Energy Program//, Submitted to Energy Policy, January 2009, Revised April 2009

**__If participation in community energy initiatives …__** for a further elaboration of these themes).

 

The 1ac is a critical challenge to centralized institutions of energy production and political decision-making – community development of distributed electricity generation establishes a framework for cooperative, equitable, and sustainable transition a new socio-technical system of renewable energy

Wolsink, 2k11

Wolsink, Maarten. &amp;#34;The research agenda on social acceptance of distributed generation in smart grids: Renewable as common pool resources.&amp;#34; Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews (2011)

What are the social foundations of smart grids… solutions for smart grid development.

 

Contention Three: Role of the Ballot

 

Policy-making and political processes should start from a “concrete institutional” perspective – we must recognize and challenge the path dependencies which define current economic and political systems by introducing new actors and trajectories within these institutional settings

Mendonc, 2k9

M. Mendonc¸a, et al., Stability, participation and transparency in renewable energy policy: Lessons from Denmark and the United States, Policy and Society (2009), doi:10.1016/j.polsoc.2009.01.007

Behind this approach is an understanding of economic … of quotas for greenhouse gas emissions.

 

This means acknowledging that the world is characterized by unavoidable complexity – attempts to simplify that complexity reductionist, cause-effect models do not provide a coherent method for dealing with modern problems

Ang 2011

Ien, Centre for Cultural Research, University of Western Sydney, Parramatta, Australia  “Navigating complexity: From cultural critique to cultural intelligence,” Continuum: Journal of Media and Cultural Studies Vol. 25, No. 6, December 2011, 779–794

It is a truism now to say that **__we live in a world …__** imaginative, non-simplistic ways of dealing with it?

 

Models that do not acknowledge complexity begin from an instrumental rationality which masks the structural violence of normalization and routinization. The pedagogy we choose when participating in and evaluating debate rounds DIRECTLY CONTRIBUTES to the means by which these processes unfold

Dillard and Ruchala. 2k5

Jessie F. School of Business Administration, Portland State University, and Linda, School of Accountancy, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, “The rules are no game: from instrumental rationality to administrative evil,” Accounting, Auditing and Accountability Journal 18.5, 2005, ProQuest

**__An instrumental perspective blurs__**, **__and …__** efficiency ratio, and classified as excess capacity.

 

To subvert this model we must engage in explicit attempts to replace the “economic space” of decision-making with a “socio-political space” of non-commodity values like democracy, equity, and sustainability

Byrne, 2k3

Byrne, John, and Yu-Mi Mun. &amp;#34;Rethinking reform in the electricity sector: Power liberalisation or energy transformation.&amp;#34; Electricity reform: Social and environmental challenges (2003): 48-76

Voting affirmative is an endorsement of our socio-political analysis of the neoliberal policy paradigm as it relates energy production

 

We affirm the resolution through our criticism of the qualitative restrictions which constrain the transition to democratic control and ownership over energy production

Therefore, as Badiou (2005a) argues, **__a new radical … of different socio-environmental futures__**.

A. Kills aff ground: allows the negative to garner the benefits of the 1ac without having to advocate solving for them
B. Doesn’t negate the resolution: Voting for the negative requires you to affirm the resolution 
C. Education: they foreclose discussion of the topic – instead of debating the merits of removing a restrictive policy paradigm in energy production debate devolves into a race to the bottom where small distinctions and debates about competition rule the day

===Contention One: “The History of Being”===

====History hitherto has been the history of Being – the evolution of the world is a process by which Being disclosing itself – each epochal manifestation of Being metamorphoses in the flux of its withdrawal and disclosure which makes their defining essences intelligible====
**Irwin and Peters, 2k2**
Ruth (Senior Lecturer in Ethics at Auckland University of Technology); Michael (Research Professor in Education at the University of Glasgow); Earthsongs: Ecopoetics, Heidegger and Dwelling, The Trumpeter Journal of Ecosophy, 2002

Again harking back to the tradition … Technology, limits the field of agency.

====The contemporary epochal mode of revealing is characterized by technological enframing – its essence is the transformation of all beings into resources devoid of intrinsic value which calls them forth to presence themselves to be ordered as a standing reserve====
**Thomson, 2k1**
Iain, University of New Mexico, Heidegger on Ontological Education, or: How We Become What We Are, Inquiry, 2001

Heidegger’s name for our contemporary …optimized with maximal ef. ciency?

====The essence of modern technology is revealed in the disclosive way of looking upon nature by the conventional wind turbine – its essence is the maximum exploitation of the wind for the production of energy – this is part and parcel of an ontology that treats nature as a standing-reserve to meet human ends====
**Klein, 2k9**
Lance, B.L.A. Kansas State University, A Phenomenological Interpretation of Biomimicry and its Potential Value for Sustainable Design, Masters Thesis in Architecture, 2009

In contrast, I suggest that … concern regarding this sustainable technology.

====The essence of ‘truth’ and ‘technology’ does not permanently endure – rather it is the historically contingent way in which Being discloses itself and is understood by Dasein – metaphysics supplies each epochal period with an ontotheological grounding – the metaphysics of presence underlying modern technological thought represents the total closure of thought that forgets the question of Being and disincentivizes ontological inquiry====
**Thomson, 2k1**
Iain, University of New Mexico, Heidegger on Ontological Education, or: How We Become What We Are, Inquiry, 2001

Heidegger’s pronouncement that the essence … Heidegger calls the history of being.

====The loss of Being that defines our historical epoch shapes the dominant social imaginary through instrumental reasoning – this denies intrinsic value to other beings and the natural world which legitimates the practices and institutionalization of war, structural violence, and environmental destruction====

Many peace researchers argue … with expansionistic logic of capitalism.

===Contention Two: “Ontological Inquiry”===

====Resolved: The United States federal government should remove all restrictions on energy production from windmills.====

====Andrew and I affirm the windmill as a means by which we may disclosively look upon Being through ontological inquiry into the essence of technology revealed by the difference between the mill and the turbine in the production of energy from wind power====

====The term ‘wind power’ refers to the conversion of the kinetic energy of the wind into mechanical or electrical energy by means of a mill or a turbine respectively====
**Encyclopedia Britannica, 2k12**
No Author Cited, Entry for “Wind Power,” 2012

Wind Power, form of energy … providing a larger total energy source.

====When given with the choice between mill and turbine, we are confronted with more than a mere affirmation of mechanical or electrical energy – it is a decision regarding the essence of technology – unlike its’ modern counterpart - the pre-modern windmill was not built to exploit the wind in order to stockpile its energy for indirect and remote purposes – its connection with the wind is immediate====
**Rojcewicz, 2k6**
Richard, Professor of Philosophy at Point Park University and cotranslator of three volumes of Heidegger’s Gesamtausgabe, The Gods and Technology: A Reading of Heidegger, 2006 

Heidegger does not answer this … exhausted in turning the gears.

====Our affirmation of the mill provides an opportunity to rethink the ways in which we engage the built environment – this alternative ontology can shift cultural relationships away from dominating technology and facilitate a sustainable life-world that reveals the interconnectedness of nature and the built environment====
**Klein, 2k9**
Lance, B.L.A. Kansas State University, A Phenomenological Interpretation of Biomimicry and its Potential Value for Sustainable Design, Masters Thesis in Architecture, 2009

In this sense, local people might … in the natural and built worlds.

====Evaluate ontology first – failure to prioritize ontological inquiry is tantamount to a “loss of Being” which impoverishes understanding while locating social-political institutions as isolated from their natural context and eliminates an authentic relationship to Being – destroying value to life and causing unchecked environmental destruction====
**Magrini, 2k12**
J.M., Professor at the College of DuPage – Illinois, Worlds Apart in the Curriculum: Heideger, Technology, and the Poietic Attunement of Literature, Educational Philosophy and Theory, Volume 44, Issue 5, Pages 500-521, July 2012

Writing in 1927, Heidegger uses the … about our lives in impoverished ways.

 

====The ontological inquiry of the 1ac is a form of counter-education that provides a starting point from which we can engage normalizing education that prioritizes disinterested instrumental rationality in politics as well as debate – instead of focusing on the successful imposition of policy we should begin from a position of transcendence that allows reflection on the meanings, identities, and quests of technological thought====
**Gur-Ze’ev, 2k2**
Ilan, The University of Haifa, Martin Heidegger, transcendence, and the possibility of counter-education, Heidegger, Education and Modernity, 2002

So even in face of the success … of the distribution of evils.

====Our mode of being-in-the-world is determined by the knowledge we value and pursue – when education in the debate community regarding topics like energy production becomes grounded in the metaphysics of enframing – our community becomes fragmented and devolves into vocationalism rather than emphasizing critical thinking as an activity with intrinsic value====

“The historical does not denote …articulated in his earlier thought.

====The pedagogical practice of ontological inquiry attuned by an authentic openness to Being creates a paradigm shift away from standardized models of unreflective praise for contemporary norms grounded in vocational, economic, and technological which holds the potential to awaken authentic ways of being-in-the-world====
**Magrini, 2k12**

The understanding of Being in … educational theory and practice.

====By recognizing the adversarial attunement of modern technology and calculative thinking we open the possibility authentic attunement – ontology is the most prior question because it is the primary ‘mode of disclosure’ through which existence is revealed and understanding, thought, and behavior are influenced====
