====First is the links – ====

====a) Ontology of Trash - The affirmatives understanding of trash as an ontological space of non-value has constituted the erasure of those who live off trash itself. Their view understands the commodity process as finished once it has turned to refuse ignoring the lived experience who continue to process it into another commodity for use====
Whitson in 2011(Risa, &amp;#34;Negotiating Place and Value: Geographies of Waste and Scavenging in Buenos Aires,&amp;#34; Volume 43, Issue 4, -http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.proxy.library.umkc.edu/doi/10.1111/anti.2011.43.issue-4/issuetocpages 1404–1433, September 2011)
Economic and social … of Buenos Aires.


====b) Anti-binarism - The affirmative rejection of binaries normalizes capitalist relationships of ownership – we must affirm binaries to understand that all social structures are determined by a fundamental division between those that sell their labor power and those that purchase it. The affirmatives alternative results in a class pluralism that makes it impossible to understand these divisions. ====
Ebert and Zavarzadeh in 2008(Teresa L., English, State University of New York, Albany, Mas~’ud, prolific writer and expert on class ideology, &amp;#34;Class in Culture&amp;#34;, p. 15-18)
In materialist theory…  No Other%21&amp;#34; 81).


====c) Cultural Affect - The focus on mediums of cultural significations, such as the body, creates an inversion of materialism that confuses the result of the modes of production with the cause. The reduction of materiality into materialism dehistoricizes class structures.====
Ebert and Zavarzadeh in 2008(Teresa L., English, State University of New York, Albany, Mas~’ud, prolific writer and expert on class ideology, &amp;#34;Class in Culture&amp;#34;, p. 38-41)
In order to … of the owners.


====d) Superstructures - The rejection of super-structures and grand narratives leaves us with no tools to fight capitalism.  The local resistance they offer is nothing more than the same democracy that has allowed the rampant expansion of capital.====
Holmstrom in 97 (Nancy, Professor Emeritus Department of Philosophy at Rutgers, Renewing Historical Materialism, Solidarity, http://www.solidarity-us.org/node/2198)
While the defeat … characteristic of capitalism.


====e) Culture - Struggle cannot be reduced to a question of personal outlook and cultural interaction. This reduction of the political radicality of the movement creates a communism that is structurally no different than today~’s capitalist model.====

In keeping with … Jerry~’s ice cream.


====f) The movements of inclusion and exclusion within given system of power relations do nothing to alter the structure and symptoms of the system. Rather than attempt to include the excluded within the current symbolic order we must make the choice to radically reconstruct this order in reference to the excluded.====

This is why … proletariat&amp;#34; -is crucial.


====Second is the impacts - ====

====a) Ethics - The naturalizing process of capitalism masks its role in ensuring subjugation on a global scale.  Our primary ethico-political responsibility is to challenge the organizing principles which found this system====

The capitalist … minute to spare.


====Third is Alternative and Method====

====a) The alternative is to reject the affirmative in favor of a historical materialist methodology to challenge capitalism. This method is critical to generate a pedagogy which privileges the relations of production for a better understanding of social and political oppression.====
Andrew N. McNight in 2010  University of Alabama at Birmingham,  A Pragmatic and pedagogically Minded Revaluation of Historical Materialism,  Journal for Critical Education Policy Studies, vol.8. no.2, http://www.jceps.com/PDFs/08-2-04.pdf

====b) Understanding economics and society as totalizing is the key methodological point of departure for understanding class relations====
Lukacs in 67 (George, Hungarian Marxist philosopher and literary critic. He is a founder … as a whole. 7-8


====c) Class consciousness must be the starting point, and it can only work with the dialectical method-their abandonment of the totality of economic relations dooms any revolutionary practice to failure====
Lukacs in 67 (George, Hungarian Marxist philosopher and literary critic. He is a founder of the tradition of Western Marxism. He contributed the ideas of reification and class consciousness to Marxist philosophy and theory, and his literary criticism was influential in thinking about realism and about the novel as a literary genre.

====There can be no synthesis between our methodological perspectives-abandoning the position of totality in favor of fragmented, isolated consciousness inevitably means an abandonment of the conditions needed for revolution====

====Economic base controls the development of social and cultural superstructure – even those superstructural changes that do implicate the base are predicated on stabilizing and maintaining the existing relations of production – this means only the alt solves the aff====

The canonical statement … in agrarian societies. 


==2nc==


====There is no space outside of capital with which to reassert a new ontology of identity-only democratic collectivity~’s refusal to be identified can shatter the sustaining logic of capitalism====

====Perm can~’t solve – focus on the aff trades off with challenging economic exploitation.====

====Dialectical materialism is the only sustainable way to stop political paralysis.  Their belief in pure subjectivity separates us from the backdrop of capitalism that determines that subjectivity, making paralysis inevitable.====

The practical danger … movement as a whole&amp;#34; 23-24


====The only way to avoid ecological collapse is to sharply limit production. This is only possible in the context of a dialectical and material methodology for understanding the environment and its relation to trash and waste.====
Smith in 2011(Richard, Institute for Policy Research %26 Development, &amp;#34;Green Capitalism: the god that failed&amp;#34;, real-world economics review, issue no. 56)
The seeming exception to … impossible under capitalism.


====The affirmative views disposal as the end-point of the process of consumption excluding the practices and modes of consumption that occur beyond the trash bin – trash is not placed elsewhere, it actively has a place with political and social connotations – political economy of trash is distinct from the ontological approach of the aff that situates trash within a cultural context seen as co-extensive with materiality====
Whitson in 2011(Risa, &amp;#34;Negotiating Place and Value: Geographies of Waste and Scavenging in Buenos Aires,&amp;#34; Volume 43, Issue 4, -http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.proxy.library.umkc.edu/doi/10.1111/anti.2011.43.issue-4/issuetocpages 1404–1433, September 2011)

====The fear of essentialism opens up room for conservative dogma that there is no alternative to the capitalist order and class based oppression – they create a negative essentialism that presumes the presence of an absence in all structures. ====
Ebert and Zavarzadeh in 2008(Teresa L., English, State University of New York, Albany, Mas~’ud, prolific writer and expert on class ideology, &amp;#34;Class in Culture&amp;#34;, p. 11-14)

a. Supply side focus relies on a public/private division that prioritizes masculine knowledge over all others. In this framework, women’s role is relegated to greening the home.

b. Nuclear energy is an overwhelmingly unjust form of energy production - even if the technology is sound it has been deployed in ways that disproportionately externalize costs onto indigenous groups and poor communities of color.

nuclear industry has fueled the anti-nuclear movement for over 70 years.

 

c. Security discourse assumes there is an anarchic world outside that we must protect against.  The desire for security becomes a masculine public desire at the expense of acknowledging the feminine.  This materially encourages structural violence to continue and closes off better understandings of the causes of war and violence in our everyday lives.

d. Their framing of water shortage in terms of its human impact sidesteps ethical issues because of its basis in discourses of self-interest. Connecting environmental destruction with human oppression is key.

2. Impact - The belief that we can control nature, and that the natural world is here for our benefit, is part of a political ideology that is existentially incompatible with the liberation of women from patriarchy.  This threatens the survival of all environmental worlds

Mallory in 99 (Chaone, Master’s thesis @ University of North Texas Toward an Ecofeminist Environmental Jurisprudence:  Nature, Law and Gender August 99 www.phil.unt.edu/theses/pdf)

3. Alt -

 

a. Our alternative is an Ecofeminist, standpoint epistemology-this involves understanding the originary Otherization of nature and women by men.  All other forms of violence are justified by this epistemology-only by embracing the knowledge structures of Others who have been excluded because of their association with femininity and nature can we unravel the violence of modernist binaries.

Pandey in 2k6 (Anupam, thesis submitted to faculty of graduate studies and research in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of doctorate of philosophy department of political science Carleton university, forgin bonds with women, nature and the third world:  an ecofeminist critique of international relations, proquest) 140-143

The most significant contribution of ecofeminism lies in its ability to plumb to the very

unwitting partners in crime, eroding the very basis of their own survival. 

 

b. New epistemological approaches are key – without alternative approaches there is no way for most of the population to access our discussions or to create real world change. Only ecofeminist thought balances empiricist analysis with localized forms of knowledge.

Our interpretation is that the affirmative wins by proving that a topical plan and its justifications are good while the negative wins by disproving the desirability of the plan or its justifications.

Framework isn’t a reason to reject the team nor a reason to exclude critical claims – it’s only a lens through which the judge should view the round. All of our ontology arguments are also reasons that including our perspective provides a unique education and better policymaking. This means we access all of their policy education in addition to adding critical interrogation.

Our framing is also neither unpredictable nor unfair – the affirmative implicitly defends its epistemic and ontological commitments throughout the 1AC – if they win the validity of these structures they can weigh the affirmative

Aff choice is never an option – its unlimiting especially since they already choose the focus of debate, means they can set the hurdle impossibly high for the negative to win from the outset

Their appeal to traditional rhetorical approaches is a new link – elevates atomized competitive masculine subject over the interdependent communal feminine subject
Kindred in 11 (Merle; Ph.D. in Rhetoric and Technical Communication at Michigan Technological University with focus on communication challenges involved in changing perception and use of energy and active consultant with the “Women in Energy” programme sponsored by USAID and SARI/Energy; “Invitational Rhetoric: Alternative Rhetorical Strategy as Ecofeminist Practice for Transformation of Perception and Use of Energy in the Residential Built Environment from the Keweenaw to Kerala” Ecofeminism and Rhetoric p. 94-96)
Ecofeminism’s lack of rigid structure or limiting conceptual content means the theory often appears as 
AND
making space for alternative strategies, such as invitational rhetoric, to develop.


Dispo Good

1.	Straight turn option checks 100 percent of the abuse- the aff always has the option to avoid multiple worlds and spend the whole 2ac straight turning the counterplan. 

2.	Key to strategic thinking- forces 2ac to debate in multiple worlds which increases critical thinking. This outweighs sall of their arguments to the ultimate impact to ground is education. And critical thinking is a better type of education because it can be applied to more fields. 

3.	Key to negative flexibility- the alternative to dispositionality is the negative shave 1 unconditional counterplan which is devastating to negative strategy giving the affirmative a massive advantage. 

Epist 1st

1. Don’t evaluate their case or impact turns 

a. Code in 6 indicates that epistemological concerns have to come first because knowledge structures condition the possibilities of thought and action - how we come to know the world determines what problems we isolate and the solutions that are considered feasible. 

b. If we win that their knowledge claims are predicated on hegemonic masculinity it proves that no part of the aff is a coherent account of the world because it offers inadequate explainations and does not include marginalized perspectives
 -water wars
 	- commercialization profit basis fails
 	- humanitarian aff focuses exclusively on water shortages in terms of crisis points - only security interests are solved 

 -hegemony
 	-affs grid and islanding internal links prove they are invested in masculine security politics rather than holistic assistance for marginalized populations the effect of the plan insulates the military from the effects of a grid attack but does not protect local disempowered communities that are forced to bear the brunt of negative externalities already this proves that even if they win that hegemony is good their strategy for pursuing hegemony is flawed

2. ideologies are rhetorically produced and distributed and determine the scope of thought on all political issues – creating counter-narratives is key.

AT Essentialism

1. None of their evidence assumes the standpoint epistemology portion of the alternative - we must recognize the particularity of each subject positions claims to knowledge in order to solve, that’s Pandey in 6

2. No essentialism - ecofeminist epistemology is a dialectical approach that recognizes the indeterminacy of different concepts of woman and nature and the strategic necessity of using certain understandings at certain times
Salleh (2003), Ariel, researcher in Political Economy at the University of Sydney : Ecofeminism as Sociology, Capitalism Nature Socialism, 14:1, 61-74 
In unpacking the irrational contradiction which locates women, and usually indigenes, simultaneously within 
AND
as &amp;#34;strategic essentialism&amp;#34; is sometimes relied on for pragmatic emphasis.16 

3. Saying all ecofeminism is essentialist assumes there is one blanket ideology that represents all ecofeminists-this is itself an essentialist assumption.
Pandey in 2k6 (Anupam, thesis submitted to faculty of graduate studies and research in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of doctorate of philosophy department of political science Carleton university, forgin bonds with women, nature and the third world:  an ecofeminist critique of international relations, proquest)
Two key arguments that summarize the ecofeminist responses to post-modern criticism shall be 
AND
she accuses ecofeminism of, that of essentialism.  68-69

4. OUR ALTERNATIVE IS THE ONLY HOPE FOR UNDERSTANDING INTERSECTIONS OF OPPRESSION
Pandey in 2k6 (Anupam, thesis submitted to faculty of graduate studies and research in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of doctorate of philosophy department of political science Carleton university, forgin bonds with women, nature and the third world:  an ecofeminist critique of international relations, proquest)
One of the chief aims of this thesis is to show that the discipline of 
AND
an assumption that needs to be grappled with rather than ignored or denied.

This also answers their arguments about women and nature not being related - as long as masc episte rules over all they will remain
Impact O/V

1. Mallory in 99 indicates that social binaries elevate masculine control and violent approaches over feminine cooperative and subsistence ways of life, this has two impacts

a. oppression of women becomes inevitable - this is an ethics DA to the affirmative that they don’t access

b. even if they win extinction comes first it is inevitable as masculine dominance will destroy all ecological life systems

2. Patriarchy comes before the aff - it is the structuring element of all violent social relations and practices. Existing power structures exclude women from decisionmaking processes which means that feminine concerns aren’t even evaluated within the traditional framing.
Buckingham 2008, Susan “Approaching Environmental Issues,” in Understanding Environmental Issues, ch.2 11-32, Sage Pub, online 
Ecofeminism is included here for a number of reasons: firstly, gender is habitually 
AND
women experiencing environmental problems more acutely than men for socio-economic reasons. 
 
This answers their impact defense because it proves that even if there are proximate causes to specific harms patriarchy is the structure that allows those scenarios to occur in the first place

3. Ethics is a prior question to impact evaluation - if we win that their impact calculus is founded on a masculine perspective that forecloses marginalized views it proves that their knowledge product does not offer an accurate depiction of the world - this makes extinction inevitable
Pandey in 2k6 (Anupam, thesis submitted to faculty of graduate studies and research in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of doctorate of philosophy department of political science Carleton university, forgin bonds with women, nature and the third world:  an ecofeminist critique of international relations, proquest) 265-267
Thus, IR as a discipline, is largely inadequate to address the issues and 
AND
that our interests be actively shaped by our ethics and vice-versa.  

AT Util

Disembodied utilitarian risk analysis is insufficient because it ignores the ways different bodies such as women experience risk differently - this produces policies that maintain existing gender binaries.
Buckingham 2008, Susan “Approaching Environmental Issues,” in Understanding Environmental Issues, ch.2 11-32, Sage Pub, online 
Eco-feminist arguments have been particularly concerned to ensure that it is societies’ attitudes 
AND
females) must be reformed if there are to be significant environmental gains. 

This also proves our epistemology first claims because even utilitarian calculus is not freed from bodily concerns and individual biases - evaluate the knowledge production of the aff before you assess consequences

Even if they win that we can objectively evaluate threats - we’ll impact turn that portion - separating rationality from emotion leads to bad decision-making and policy failure. 
Mercer 2005, Jonathan “Rationality and Psychology in International Politics,” International Organization, Vol. 59, No. 1 (Winter, 2005), pp. 77-106, jstor
Developments in neuroscience-such as brain imaging techniques that allow scientists to examine emotion 
AND
I emphasize community or identity as an internal solution to collective action problems.


AT Empirics Prove

Deferral to untempered empiricism precludes the introduction of alternative forms of knowledge and prevents the necessary reflection to make effective predictions and empirical analysis.
Code in 6 (Lorraine; Distinguished Research Professor Emerita of Philosophy at York University in Toronto Canada and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada; Ecological Thinking: The Politics of Epistemic Location; p.102-103)
Within orthodox epistemology, the very idea of negotiation sits just as uneasily as does 
AND
the temptation to produce the flashy, instant solution can seem irresistibly strong. 

EJ

Independently, the masculine epistemology of dominance ensures unequal displacements of the impact of energy policies.
Wapner and Matthew 2009, Paul, American University and Richard A., University of Cal, Irvine “The Humanity of Global Environmental Ethics,” The Journal of Environment Development 2009; 18; 203, DOI: 10.1177/1070496509334693 
Resource, land, and sink displacement across space is about the privileged ignoring or 
AND
of the developed world. Such are the rationales justifying displacement across space. 

Turns the aff -

Environmental injustices short circuit solutions to ecological problems because it means that the most powerful and ecologically destructive segments of the population never have to confront their practices and have no incentive to change their ways of life

Makes international and domestic conflict more likely because it puts social pressures on disenfranchised populations that cause stresses and greater tension which exacerbates insecurity

2NC Ext - Mgmt

Extend Mallory - exploitation of nature and women are inextricably linked one cannot be dealt with alone without the other - their conception of the environment as a tool for human use is a patriarchal understanding of the world that marginalizes feminine concerns. Turns case because it makes ecological destruction and patriarchal violence inevitable

This form of purely instrumental understanding eviscerates ethical and moral considerations - apriori reject it.
Wapner and Matthew 2009, Paul, American University and Richard A., University of Cal, Irvine “The Humanity of Global Environmental Ethics,” The Journal of Environment Development 2009; 18; 203, DOI: 10.1177/1070496509334693 
Since its inception in the early 1970s, environmental ethics as a discipline has focused 
AND
to build picnic tables” (Foreman, 1993, p. 192). 

2NC Ext - Security

Extend Peterson 2k - two links

a. public/private DA - affs focus on security discourse assumes the state is the only important unit in IR this elevates the public sphere over private concerns because only masculine ideals of sovereignty can shape politics - turns case because this makes recourse to war more likely within their framework as cooperation and interdependence are marginalized

b. rationality DA - the affs assumption of rational actors excludes and feminizes non-state actors as irrational and irrelevant to concerns, foreclosing alternative perspectives

c. this also isolates questions about the third world from consideration because it assumes that masculine terms of mastery can manage and control those natural and devalued spaces
Pandey in 2k6 (Anupam, thesis submitted to faculty of graduate studies and research in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of doctorate of philosophy department of political science Carleton university, forging bonds with women, nature and the third world:  an ecofeminist critique of international relations, proquest) 9-10
IR as a discipline is inadequate to address issues of vital importance to the Third 
AND
with nature and in the process, reassess and heal their relationships with humans

Humanitarian discourse is used to entrench gender norms as a means of victimizing women that need to be saved by the male white savior from the evil men in another country that can’t save itself. This is used to justify new forms of imperial domination.
Denike in 2008(Margaret, Associate Professor of Human Rights and the Coordinator of the Human Rights Program at Carleton University, “The Human Rights of Others: Sovereignty, Legitimacy, and &amp;#34;Just Causes&amp;#34; for the &amp;#34;War on Terror&amp;#34;”, Hypatia, Volume 23, Number 2, Spring) 
From its outset, the official state discourses that have urged, supported, and 
AND
inheres in saving helpless female victims from racialized and demonized incarnations of evil. 


Link - Realism

REALISM INEVITABLE ARGUMENTS ARE JUST MORE LINKS-YOU ASSUME THAT A WHITE, MALE-CENTRIC EXPERIENCE IS BOTH BENEFICIAL AND INEVITABLE.  THIS IS THE ROOT CAUSE OF ALL YOUR 1AC IMPACTS
Peterson in 2000 (V Spike, Associate Professor of Political Science @ Arizona, SAIS Review, 20.2, rereading public and private:  the dichotomy that is not one, project muse)
In addition, relegating women to an invisible private sphere lends authority and legitimacy to 
AND
not only reproduces hierarchical assumptions conceptually but also institutionalizes hierarchy in material practices.

2. The aff and the alt are mutually exclusive methodologies – this is a debate about how to go about challenging capitalism, the aff merely modifies the existing system while the alternative creates an entirely new system. The impact is cooption.

3. Perm can’t solve – focus on the aff trades off with challenging economic exploitation.

What is of primary concern in anarchic-ludic politics is not so much &amp;#34;
AND
is &amp;#34;radical democracy&amp;#34; that is the outcome of an eschatological historiography.

4. Permutation still links – including any part of the affirmative risks tainting our historical materialist struggles with the distraction of aesthetic judgement and discourse which allows capitalism to diffuse the struggle and prevent its operation by satisfying different groups within the revolutionary struggle one at a time with small concessions. Or vapid forms of resistance.

5. Their Adams evidence isn’t even aff perm evidence its about Anzaldua and Friedman 
AND
unity in favor of what it believes to be aporias of that system.


AT Link Turn

1. The link only goes one way – engaging in discursive and identity based resistance distracts from the universal character of economic domination. Without any ability to discern between competing identities or form at least a contigent form of truth based on the material relations of production one cannot even begin to mount a challenge to capitalism. Rather, the result is only small modifications on the surface of capitalism which conceal the causes of exploitation and enable capitalist elites to fill in and coopt any liberatory possibilities
