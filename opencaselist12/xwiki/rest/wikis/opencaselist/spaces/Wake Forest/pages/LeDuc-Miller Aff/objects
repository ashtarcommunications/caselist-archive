Speed

Time Constraints from speaking fast force you to become more efficient—improving real world education and preparation

Second, in terms of things I gained, are all of the skills I 
AND
and prepares one for juggling the many things as we all must do. 


Turn—Speaking Fast is necessary in real life political and legal debates
Erwin Chemerinsky 2001, the Sydney M. Irmas Professor of Public Interest Law, Legal Ethics and Political Science at the University of Southern California School of Law, Fall 2001, (Speech presented as the Keynote Address at the Tahoe Conference on Academic Debate, Argumentation and Advocacy. River Falls: Fall 2001.Vol.38, Iss. 2;  pg. 63)

Frankly, there are a few things that I learned in debate that haven&amp;#39;t mattered 
AND
able to talk very fast to get one&amp;#39;s points in is a necessity. 


AT: Whiteness

Their argument elevates white supremacy to an all-pervasive force that explains nearly all global oppression~-~--this conceptual expansion hides the actual practice of racism and makes breaking it down more difficult
Andersen 3 – Margaret L. Andersen, Professor of Sociology and Women&amp;#39;s Studies and Vice Provost for Academic Affairs at the University of Delaware, 2003, “Whitewashing Race: A Critical Perspective on Whiteness,” in White Out: The Continuing Significance of Racism, edDoaneand Bonilla-Silva, p. 28

Conceptually, one of the major problems in the whiteness literature is the reification of 
AND
come to mean just about everything, it ends up meaning hardly anything.


Perm

The Anti-Coal movement is polycentric and coalitional – it brings together multiples agents of resistance by targeting specific Coal plants like those that poison each breath of air we breathe ourselves AND by challenging the larger global system of fossil fuel powered injustice
Russell 9 – Grassroots Action Organizer 
Joshua Kahn Russell is the grassroots actions organizer at Rainforest Action Network and was an organizer on the Capitol Climate Action, May 2009, Z Magazine, http://www.zcommunications.org/climate-justice-and-coals-funeral-procession-by-joshua-kahn-russell
The pace of direct actions against coal has sharply increased since 2004. These campaigns 
AND
coal as one strand of a robust frontline-led climate justice movement.


Science Knowledge
Our 1AC teaches debaters how to speak in the language of experts~-~--that solves cession of science and politics to ideological elites –only way to speak truth to power
Hoppe 99 Robert Hoppe is Professor of Policy and knowledge in the Faculty of Management and Governance at Twente University, the Netherlands. &amp;#34;Argumentative Turn&amp;#34; Science and Public Policy, volume 26, number 3, June 1999, pages 201–210 works.bepress.com

ACCORDING TO LASSWELL (1971), policy science is about the production and application of 
AND
and to a broader audience of an ideologically disoriented and politically disenchanted citizenry.
Monbiot

Global warming movements are coming now thanks to a decline in identity politics ~-~-- their strategy crushes those movements ~-~-- causes extinction 
George Monbiot, English Writer and Environmental and Political Activist, 9-4-2008, “Identity Politics in Climate Change Hell,” http://www.celsias.com/article/identity-politics-climate-change-hell/
If you want a glimpse of how the movement against climate change could crumble faster 
AND
this urgent task into the identity politics that have wrecked so many movements.

AT: Aesthetics

Their use of the black arts movement is inherently violent – the black/non black binary reinforces difference and incentivizes white audiences to adopt reactionary measures – simply recognizing fundamental difference solves
Watts 2004 – Associate Professor of Media Studies at UNC Chapel Hill, PhD in rhetorical studies from Northwestern (Eric King, “The Ethos of a Black Aesthetic: An Exploration of Larry Neal&amp;#39;s Visions of a Liberated Future,” The Ethos of Rhetoric ed. Michael Hyde, p. 101-103)

In terms of exploring how the black aesthetic functioned as a mode of interpretive understanding 
AND
a discourse that points the way out of the paradox of purity.

Personal Exp Bad


Empiricism is good and personal experience backfires
A- Defer to expert assessments of systemic conditions – allowing any opinion misdiagnoses the problem and causes more harm to disenfranchised communities
Hart 2013 – associate professor of psychology in the departments of psychiatry and psychology at Columbia University, is a research fellow at the Institute for Research in African-American Studies at Columbia and a research scientist at the New York State Psychiatric Institute (Carl, “Keep to Your Expertise,” http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2013/02/04/do-black-intellectuals-need-to-talk-about-race/on-race-issues-academics-should-keep-to-their-expertise)
The strange proposition that black intellectuals – regardless of their training – are “race 
AND
And the listening community has the obligation of distinguishing informed opinion from tweets.

Code Switching

Code-switching naturalizes linguistic communities and covers over the hybridity that is proper to all language - We are always code-switching and insisting that one particular language code is necessary for communication with a particular population risks essentialism 
Mellom 6 - Assistant Research Scientist for CLASE; Center for Latino Achievement and Success in Education CODE-SWITCHING AT A BILINGUAL SCHOOL IN COSTA RICA: IDENTITY, INTERTEXTUALITY AND NEW ORTRAITS OF COMPETENCE, PAULA JEAN MELLOM
http://athenaeum.libs.uga.edu/bitstream/handle/10724/9023/mellom_paula_j_200605_phd.pdf?sequence=1

On the other hand, some sociolinguists have tended to view code-switching as 
AND
asserts that we must remember that all “standard languages” are hybrids.



***1AR
 
Their argument assumes we share their cultural history – if we attempted to use the black vernacular it would come across as disingenuous  
Brown 2002 – PhD @ UMich, Professor of Political Science and African Studies at Loyola Marymount (Antonio, “Performing &amp;#34;truth&amp;#34;: Black speech acts,” African American Review36. 2 (Summer 2002): 213-225.)

I posit that the form of &amp;#34;truth&amp;#34; asserted by the invocation of Black 
AND
form communities, and such forms and formations are honored as cultural identifiers.
