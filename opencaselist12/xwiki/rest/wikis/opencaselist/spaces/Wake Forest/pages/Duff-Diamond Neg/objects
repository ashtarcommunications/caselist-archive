Relying on CCS to mitigate CO2 emissions means accepting a 10-40% energy penalty at the power station, depending on the type of technology used.91 An energy penalty of just 20% would require the construction of an additional power station for every four of the same size built with CCS, to maintain the same net output before the CCS was fitted.92
These reductions in efficiency will require more coal to be mined, transported and burned 
AND
, including habitat destruction, damage to rivers and waterways and air pollution.
Power station efficiency losses would be most pronounced when capture systems are retrofitted to existing 
AND
of existing coal power stations are unlikely ever to be retrofitted for capture.
The decision on whether or not to retrofit also hinges on a power station’s proximity

Greater energy efficiency is half of the solution to tackling the climate crisis. Employing a technology that reduces the energy efficiency of coal-fired power plants will not bring about the sustainable energy future needed to protect the climate.
