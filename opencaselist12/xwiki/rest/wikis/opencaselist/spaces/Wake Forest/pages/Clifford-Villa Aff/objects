(% style=&amp;#34;font-size: 7pt; &amp;#34; %)Last month, the Institute for National Strategic Studies at National Defense University released a report entitled Small Nuclear Reactors for Military Installations: Capabilities, Costs, and Technological Implications. Authored by Dr. Richard Andres of the National War College and Hanna Breetz from Harvard University, the paper analyzes the potential for the Department of Defense to incorporate small reactor technology on its domestic military bases and in forward operating locations. According to Andres and Breetz, the reactors have the ability to solve two critical vulnerabilities in the military&amp;#39;s mission: the dependence of domestic bases on the civilian electrical grid and the challenge of supplying ample fuel to troops in the field. Though considerable obstacles would accompany such a move ~-~- which the authors openly admit ~-~- the benefits are significant enough to make the idea merit serious consideration. (%%)At its heart, a …(% style=&amp;#34;font-size: 7pt; &amp;#34; %)locations, reducing the associated fears that would surely arise from the distribution of reactors across the country.

Science by its nature facilitates diplomacy because it strengthens …security, increase global partnerships, and create sustainability.

Also, it’s a conflict filter
