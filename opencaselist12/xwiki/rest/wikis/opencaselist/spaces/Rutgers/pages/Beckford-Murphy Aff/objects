&#xD;
Despite popular belief and societal hype, solar power has devastating environmental impacts. Chemicals from solar panels are catalysts for lung cancer, kidney failure, and gene mutation that will affect reproduction of future generations.&#xD;

Erica Gies for Earth Island Journal, part of the Guardian Environment Network guardian.co.uk, Friday 3 September 2010 09.03 EDT “Are solar panels the next e-waste? http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/sep/03/solar-panels-ewaste&#xD;
Solar modules contain some …. of various types of modules. &#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
We are reaching a point in time where solar panels installed decades ago are running out of power.  The solar power deemed as environmentally friendly will significantly contribute to E-Waste unless there is change. What should be an American problem will be dumped in developing countries.&#xD;

“Recycling Solar Panels A Big Money Maker?” by Lauren Craig 1/19/12,  she holds an M.S. in International Development from Tulane University, and is co-founder of Sustainable Systems Integrators, LLC., an employee-owned solar energy design and installation firm in New Orleans, LA. She is also certified in PV design and installation by the North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners (NABCEP). From http://www.earthtechling.com/2012/01/recycling-solar-panels-a-big-money-maker/&#xD;
Twenty-five is a magic number …. for human or environmental health. &#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;

E-waste is continuously sent to villages of East Asian and African countries. Schools, churches and markets have literally become landfills of American electronics&#xD;

North Americans and Europeans discard ….forced to live within them. &#xD;

Observation 2: Disposability  &#xD;
&#xD;
The environmental destruction via waste dumping warrant particular attention – Nonwestern civilization has become the dumping ground for American technology &#xD;

The Cote d&amp;#39;Ivoire toxic ….companies.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
The dehumanization as a result e-waste is not in isolation but rather represents the gaps of privilege and exclusion in the current world order. Our affirmative recognizes the interconnectedness of technology, biopower, capitalism and racism and complacency towards the issue of e-waste is the final confirmation of disposability. &#xD;

This makes life calculable, rendering it meaningless, making violence inevitable&#xD;

&#xD;

Thus Jazir and I advocate that the United States Federal government should establish a recycle, reuse and reward infrastructure for solar panels.&#xD;

Observation 3:  Solvency &#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
Government economic incentives for recycling solar panels would overcome any cost disparities and spur recycling&#xD;

 The first question facing solar firms …. onrush of solar panels? &#xD;

Tolerating the destruction of this ecosystem saps us of our humanity—it’s the opening act  for war and human extinction. &#xD;
Bookchin 87 (Murray, co-founder of the Institute of Social Ecology “An Appeal For Social and Psychological Sanity” 1987)&#xD;
Industrially and technologically, we are moving at …. reproduce a green and living world.&#xD;

&#xD;
Observation 4:  Environmental Thermodynamics&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
The 1ac signifies a shift towards the principles of environmental thermodynamics which are concerned with the interaction of technology and the natural world. Thermodynamic reasoning is necessary for societal change &#xD;

Increasingly environmentalists feel ….of social change that we should welcome. &#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
We need to recognize that matter cannot be created or destroyed but transformed into something else. The plan utilizes this principle and betters our relationship with the environment.&#xD;

It is a fact that humans are part of nature …. exigency. &#xD;
&#xD;

We are on a road to destroying the planet that sustains all live. Absent a move towards environmental thermodynamics and ecological development the extinction becomes inevitable.&#xD;
