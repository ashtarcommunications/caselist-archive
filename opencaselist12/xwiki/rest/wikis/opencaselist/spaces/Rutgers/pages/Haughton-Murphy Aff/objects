Tim Wise April 13th 2011 Tim Wise and White Privilege http://changefromwithin.org/2011/04/13/tim-wise-and-white-privilege/

 Wise served as an adjunct faculty member at the Smith College School for Social Work, in Northampton, Massachusetts, where he co-taught a Master’s level class on Racism in the U.S. In 2001, Wise trained journalists to eliminate racial bias in reporting, as a visiting faculty-in-residence at the Poynter Institute in St. Petersburg, Florida. From 1999-2003, Wise was an advisor to the Fisk University Race Relations Institute, in Nashville, and in the early ’90s he was Youth Coordinator and Associate Director of the Louisiana Coalition Against Racism and Nazism: the largest of the many groups organized for the purpose of defeating neo-Nazi political candidate, David Duke. He graduated from Tulane University in 1990 and received antiracism training from the People’s Institute for Survival and Beyond, in New Orleans.

But … survival


Calls to action on Thorium are key to generating the leadership necessary to ensure a shift to LFTRs. Right now Thorium reactors are adrift without an advocate, guaranteeing they won’t be implemented.

Our knowledge of nuclear power has eroded as our engagement with nuclear power became wholly negative. Our critical history of uranium and nuclear weaponization acts as a springboard to breakdown militaristic thought and make thorium power viable.

Plan

The United States federal government should lower its antidumping tariffs on crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells from the People’s Republic of China


Contention 1 is Trade

Recent US anti-dumping tariffs on Chinese Solar cell imports will be upheld and negatively impact trade relations
Zhang 9-18-12, Yuwei, China Daily US, “Obama steps up trade fight with China over autos”, http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/epaper/2012-09/18/content_15765633.htm
This year, the US also ordered anti-dumping and countervailing duties against Chinese
AND
and orders will be issued&amp;#34; for imposing the duties,&amp;#34; Perry added.



US solar tariffs threaten to start a clean energy trade war

Tucker 8/27/12, William, work has appeared in Harper’s, the Atlantic Monthly, the American Spectator, the Weekly Standard, National Review, Reason, the New Republic, Reader’s Digest, the Wall Street Journal, and many other publications, “Let’s Just Admit Solar Needs Help and Avoid Trade War”, http://www.nucleartownhall.com/blog/william-tucker-let%E2%80%99s-just-admit-solar-needs-help-and-avoid-trade-war/
Although the newspapers haven’t been paying much attention lately, the United States and China 
AND
this will make for good old clean-and-green solar power.

Now is key – solar spills over and escalates within months

Bloomberg 9/5 Bloomberg News, “China Speeding U.S. Solar-Dumping Case as Election Nears: Energy,” http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-05/china-speeding-u-s-solar-dumping-case-as-election-nears-energy.html
China is accelerating a dispute with the U.S. over solar-energy 
AND
solar projects rose 61 percent to $137.8 billion last year.

Strategic value of renewables makes this conflict uniquely likely to escalate

Beijing Review 9/3/12 Citing Li Chunding, Ph.D. in Economics, research assistant at the Institute of World Economics and Politics at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, “Frictions over renewable energy,” http://www.china.org.cn/business/2012-09/03/content_26410601.htm
A month after the United States launched the anti-dumping and countervailing investigations against 
AND
is not likely to make a compromise on trade frictions in this sector.¶

The greatest threat for the 21st century is that these economic flare-ups between 
AND
–far more than increases in military budgets and anti-satellite tests.

That risks extinction
Hunkovic 9 – American Military University Lee J, 2009, “The Chinese-Taiwanese Conflict: Possible Futures of a Confrontation between China, Taiwan and the United States of America”, http://www.lamp-method.org/eCommons/Hunkovic.pdf
A war between China, Taiwan and the United States has the potential to escalate 
AND
outcome, therefore, other countries will not be considered in this study.

An escalated U.S. China trade war results in economic conflicts and devastating protectionism 

Wang and Li 11 (Jianhua and Yunlu—Xinhua news agency, citing Ni Feng, Vice President of the Institute of American Studies underthe Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, Zhao Jinping, vice director of the Foreign Economic Department of the Development Research Center (DRC) of the State Council “China-US trade war no good for anyone”, October 13, 2011. http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90780/7616581.html 
A trade war between the United States and China, each of which is the 
AND
and will even lead to political and military confrontations in some sensitive regions. 

Protectionism activates every global hotspot – most likely scenario for nuclear conflict

Panzner 8—25-year veteran of the markets who has worked for for HSBC, Soros Funds, ABN Amro, Dresdner Bank, and J.P. Morgan Chase. New York Institute of Finance faculty member and a graduate of Columbia University. (Michael, Financial Armageddon, 136-8)
Continuing calls for curbs on the flow of finance and trade will inspire the United 
AND
between Muslims and Western societies as the beginnings of a new world war.


Causes resource wars, overall massive instability erupting in global hotspots they all go nuclear 

Harris and Burrows 9 Mathew, PhD European History @ Cambridge, counselor of the U.S. National Intelligence Council (NIC) and Jennifer, member of the NIC’s Long Range Analysis Unit “Revisiting the Future: Geopolitical Effects of the Financial Crisis” http://www.ciaonet.org/journals/twq/v32i2/f_0016178_13952.pdf

Of course, the report encompasses more than economics and indeed believes the future is 
AND
within and between states in a more dog-eat-dog world. 


Most recent studies provide a direct connection between poor economic relations and military conflict

Royal 10 – Jedediah Royal, Director of Cooperative Threat Reduction at the U.S. Department of Defense, 2010, “Economic Integration, Economic Signaling and the Problem of Economic Crises,” in Economics of War and Peace: Economic, Legal and Political Perspectives, ed. Goldsmith and Brauer, p. 213-215
Less intuitive is how periods of economic decline may increase the likelihood of external conflict
AND
such, the view presented here should be considered ancillary to those views.

The tariff prevents clean energy cooperation

AP 5/19/12 “Ruling adds to China trade tension: POSSIBLE U.S. TARIFFS ON SOLAR-PANEL IMPORTS MAY THREATEN CLEAN ENERGY COOPERATION,” http://www.stltoday.com/business/local/ruling-adds-to-china-trade-tension/article_c7071e82-78b7-5d95-b943-a8c6e5cc93de.html
POSSIBLE U.S. TARIFFS ON SOLAR-PANEL IMPORTS MAY THREATEN CLEAN ENERGY 
AND
trade probe have warned China might retaliate against U.S. suppliers.

That’s key to global clean tech diffusion

Lin 11 Justin Yifu Lin, Former World Bank Chief Economist and Senior Vice President, “China, the US and clean energy cooperation,” Jan 21 2011, http://blogs.worldbank.org/developmenttalk/china-the-us-and-clean-energy-cooperation
Second, there … come to the fore. 

Specifically derails the diffusion of solar

Green 11, 12-19, Martin, executive research director at the Photovoltaics Centre of Excellence at the University of New South Wales in Australia, “A Solar Trade War Could Put Us All in the Dark”, http://www.technologyreview.com/news/426392/a-solar-trade-war-could-put-us-all-in-the-dark/
The brewing solar trade war between the United States and China sullies what should be 
AND
decades of international innovation and stall the global adoption of advanced solar technology.

Chinese imports are key – the tariff directly raises prices

Berkman et al 12 Dr. Mark P. Berkman, Ph.D. in Public Policy Analysis, expert in applied microeconomics and principal at the Brattle Group; Dr. Lisa J. Cameron, Ph.D. in Economics and Senior Consultant for the Brattle Group; Judy Chang, economist with expertise in the analysis of electricity power markets and principal at the Brattle Group; “The Employment Impacts of Proposed Tariffs on Chinese Manufactured Photovoltaic Cells and Modules,” January 30 2012, http://coalition4affordablesolar.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/_Solar-Trade-Impact-Report.pdf
Average module prices in the U.S. are largely determined by Chinese imports
AND
the imposition of a 50% or 100% tariff on Chinese imports. 

The alternative is global war

Droege 2 Peter Droege, Asia Pacific chair of the World Council for Renewable Energy, Professor at the University of Liechtenstein and the University of Newcastle School of Architecture and Built Environment; “Renewable Energy and the City: Urban life in an age of fossil fuel depletion and climate change,” 23 Jan 2002, http://enviroscope.iges.or.jp/contents/13/data/PDF/WORD%20Pdf/9-1Droege_peter.pdf
While a few local urban systems may seem relatively safe from a terminal fossil fuel 
AND
not the only threat to the survivability of the modern global urban system.

Public debate is necessary to inform the public about the risks of protectionism

Sungjoon Cho, Assistant Professor of Law, Chicago-Kent College of Law, Illinois Institute of Technology, Doha&amp;#39;s Development, 25 Berkeley J. Int&amp;#39;l L. 165, 2007, LN
In this regard, (public) ignorance is not bliss in the making of 
AND
global tariff wars that contributed to the outbreak of the Second World War.

In short, predictions of a Water World War are overwrought. However, tensions 
AND
, freshwater will only further frustrate stability efforts in the world&amp;#39;s volatile regions.

Those wars go global
