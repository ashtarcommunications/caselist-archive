“Testify”-Common (17 -32 secs)

The pretext for the horrors of the Middle Passage racialized environmental degradation, and silences surrounding the violence of energy crisis at the heart of the topic is the common sense ordering of white supremacy.

 Variable, overlapping, and ….organic to its ordering.  

Only discussing environmental issues within the context of anti-black reality takes into account the blacks’ status as refuse within the political economy of pollution and energy policy.

Charles W.  Mills, “ Black  Trash”  2001
For a state founded …. white body politic.
 

Thus, Chris and I defend the resolution as a site of trial for energy policy.

The jury is in and I say Guilty! The daily reality for blackness  is the ontic of  criminalization-always subject to an a-priori condition within the discursive fields of white intelligibility. This hegemony is made possible  by a false, unchallenged reality that obfuscates the existence of its own imperialism.

Freedom still remains. …. differences are constituted.

 

Transplanting an ethic of accountability for racial injustice into the discussion of energy policy exposes and informs us to the systems of power which shape its substance and create the conditions of possibility for racial violence and internalized oppression.

Testimony is powerful!!Breaking the silence surrounding our differences is essential. People of color must continue to resist by living and speaking their personal truths, to carve out spaces to exist on our own terms.

One about Frank Ocean, another about Sheila Holt-Orsted, and a final piece about Elijah and his mother]&#xD;
The death of Frank Ocean  and the birth of Sheila Orsted are central to the question of the topic because their bodies reveal how systems of power in our environments work to over-determine social identities like his and yours, mine and hers, some and others. Where some of those identities are privileged and give meaning to others, those dis-privileged positions are forced to accept meaning prescribed by those with the power to do so.&#xD;
This is especially true for energy production .It’s a  big question. So big it became the topic. But the topic fails to explain for which bodies is energy produced for, who gets to consume it and who is consumed by it!&#xD;
Sheila represents not just herself, but where many forgotten bodies stand under the discussion of energy policy , outside of the state and outside of the discussion. Her family’s taxes and economic energies in addition to the physical energies expended on her farm , and the work she did for the environment didn’t do enough to make environmental and energy policy spend energy on her. &#xD;
Sheila represents the black family 6 times more likely to live next to the power plant that spews poisons into  the air.&#xD;
She represents the single mother in Baltimore that works 40 hours a week but can’t afford to heat her home in the winter.&#xD;
The family on the reservation that has nuclear waste dumped on their sacred burial ground.&#xD;
But once again, which bodies is energy produced for and why does the topic not answer this question?&#xD;
The Sheila’s of the world get left out of the policy discussion , get left out of energy production, and get left out of the topic.&#xD;
Thus , we feel that this debate should be about who has the best method of relating to and analyzing socially overdetermined identities.&#xD;

E. CHRISTI CUNNINGHAM “Creation Out of Bounds :Toward Wholistic Identity” 2009. Extracted from Black Sexualities,Rutgers Press &#xD;
Identity oppression essentially …. to identity constriction.&#xD;
&#xD;
In The same way in which certain bodies are arbitrarily marked as black, for all that that comes with, and others as policymakers, kritik debaters and performers. Decided from the outside and not from within, we constantly struggle to reclaim ourselves in social spaces like debate and not be forgotten.&#xD;
This year, like so many others, the power to determine goes to those few who are marked as leaders , the producers of the productive, the deciding factor on what productions matters but doesn’t attempt to fix the environments of those who are forgotten.&#xD;
