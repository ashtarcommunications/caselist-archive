Plan: The United States federal government should offer financial incentives to the private sector to develop solar power satellites as per Globus, with any end product being exclusively owned and launched by the USFG.

Advantage 1: Space Hegemony

The United States is falling behind now
William John Cox, ’11, public interest lawyer, author and political activist Tuesday, Mar 29, 2011, (Consortium News, The Race for Solar Energy from Space, http://axisoflogic.com/artman/publish/Article_62659.shtml)

The failure of the General Electric …its economic, energy, political and military problems. 



2 Internal Links – 

First, US energy dependence erodes hegemony
Alex Michael Bonnici, 2009, involved with Atlantica Expeditions, appointed the European Union Liaison for the Undersea Colony project, physics teacher, Tuesday, January 20, 2009, (The Discovery Enterprise, Solar Power Satellites: The Yes Case, http://discoveryenterprise.blogspot.com/2009/01/solar-power-satellites-yes-case.html)


Is now the time for major government funding ….SPS has received minimal research funding to date in comparison.

Second, SPS boosts the economy, and triggers a Space Launcher industry
Jeremy Elton Jacquot, 2008, PhD Candidate, University of Southern California to obtain a Ph.D. in Marine Environmental Biology, 10.15.08, (Treehugger.com, Could Solar Power Satellites Beam Down Gigawatts of Energy?, http://www.treehugger.com/files/2008/10/solar-power-satellite.php)

Such a large-scale project would definitely …..,&amp;#34; a novel all about building the first SPS.


Launchers are a key starting point for Space Leadership
Mark Stout, 2009, a researcher and analyst at Air University’s National Space Studies Center  29 October 2009, (U.S. Space Leadership: Reverting to the Mean?, http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:_C0FcFny93AJ:www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/nssc/op-ed/american_spacepower_reverting_to_the_mean.pdf+United+States+%22space+leadership%22andhl=enandgl=us)


Is there anything that can save us from ….our space leadership, they are an essential and compelling starting point to do just that.


2 Impacts –

First, Primacy is key to the global economy
Thayer 07 Associate Professor at Missouri State University Bradley “American Empire: A Debate” (pg 43-44)

Economic prosperity is also a product of the American Empire. ..Third World, so that they too may enjoy economic prosperity
