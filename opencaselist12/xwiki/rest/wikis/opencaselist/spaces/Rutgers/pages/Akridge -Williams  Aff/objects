The status quo is a characterization of an invisible racial contract that’s the root cause of otherizing genocidal politics - Disposability becomes written onto black bodies and spaces where resource disparities exist in order to maintain the purity of white spaces.

Plan: The United States federal government should reduce Nuclear Regulatory Commission restrictions on new nuclear power plant designs and divert all nuclear funding in the status quo for the research and production of liquid fluoride thorium reactors. 
 




Observation 2: The Truth is all around us - The science behind warming is rock solid – most scientific reports have confirmed the validity of the greenhouse gas effects; however, modern reactionaries on the march have taken over “climate denial” as their new pet project

The effects of warming strike at the heart of minority rights – systematic discrimination means marginalized communities are less likely to survive global warming, threatening their unique culture – they are the acceptable casualties of climate denial.

Climate denialism is the last bastion of invisible racism. The Politics of denial act to preserve the interests of the rich white male, ignoring the impact borne by minorities.

No concessions—We cannot accept any degree of racism. It makes injustice and violence inevitable. You have an affirmative obligation to act in the face of racism – solvency is not an issue

Discourse on nuclear waste offer a unique space to expose what has been hidden from us.  Our advocacy opens a dialogue that allows us to uncover the concealed motivations that govern our actions

Observation 4: Militaristic Thought –The Development of nuclear energy was not for our benefit, it was rooted in the quest for military supremacy. Nuclear power that was divorced from military use was actively discarded.

The military’s appropriation of Nuclear Power has perverted our thinking on Nuclear energy, bringing to mind destruction and fear.  Exposing this is key to accessing alternative forms of nuke energy.

Observation 5: Solvency – We must combat the harms and obfuscations highlighted by the affirmative through discourse.

On climate change, it’s not a question of solvency, but one of exposition – we must constantly discursively challenge the dominant paradigms of climate denial. Engaging in climate denial is an act of discursive violence, and we must combat it at every turn.

On the current struggle against global warming the environmental movement has exemplified modern color muteness and we must connect the dots between racial discrimination in warming if we are to survive. The current environment movement engages in the subtle racism of erasure, focusing exclusively on the impact on whiteness.

Tim Wise April 13th 2011 Tim Wise and White Privilege http://changefromwithin.org/2011/04/13/tim-wise-and-white-privilege/

 Wise served as an adjunct faculty member at the Smith College School for Social Work, in Northampton, Massachusetts, where he co-taught a Master’s level class on Racism in the U.S. In 2001, Wise trained journalists to eliminate racial bias in reporting, as a visiting faculty-in-residence at the Poynter Institute in St. Petersburg, Florida. From 1999-2003, Wise was an advisor to the Fisk University Race Relations Institute, in Nashville, and in the early ’90s he was Youth Coordinator and Associate Director of the Louisiana Coalition Against Racism and Nazism: the largest of the many groups organized for the purpose of defeating neo-Nazi political candidate, David Duke. He graduated from Tulane University in 1990 and received antiracism training from the People’s Institute for Survival and Beyond, in New Orleans.

But … survival


Calls to action on Thorium are key to generating the leadership necessary to ensure a shift to LFTRs. Right now Thorium reactors are adrift without an advocate, guaranteeing they won’t be implemented.

The …solution.

Our knowledge of nuclear power has eroded as our engagement with nuclear power became wholly negative. Our critical history of uranium and nuclear weaponization acts as a springboard to breakdown militaristic thought and make thorium power viable.

History has shown us that policy decisions are key to changing public perception on nuclear energy. Engaging with the public and policymakers is critical to a shifting our culture away from one of destruction to one where thorium  is a symbol in opposition to Uranium.
