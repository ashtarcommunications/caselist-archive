===2NC Overview===

====The 1AC opens with a story about Buffalo and Eagle Wind. The rest 
AND
the unique culture of the Blackfoot nation – that~~~’s Bird 95.====


====The Blackfoot Nation has a unique identity and should not be homogenized as a singular universal Indian identity====
NLA 11
(Native Languages of the Americas website &amp;#34;Native Languages of the Americas: 
Blackfoot (Siksika, Peigan, Piegan, Kainai, Blackfeet)&amp;#34; 2011 ~~~~http://www.native-languages.org/blackfoot-legends.htm-http://www.native-languages.org/blackfoot-legends.htm~~~~, TSW)

People: The Blackfoot Nation today actually consists of four distinct Blackfoot nations, who 
AND
in Canada and the United States which has a good chance for survival. 


===AT: Don~~~’t Know What to Call===

====We advocate that the use of the term Blackfoot Nation would solve back any of these impacts. The entirety of the 1AC is based off of one of their most sacred legends.====

===2NC Link Wall===

====The aff creates four singular notions of &amp;#34;Indian&amp;#34; in the 1AC.====

====1 – In their &amp;#34;study&amp;#34; section, the aff focuses on THE &amp;#34;Indian&amp;#34; being carried on the Wind, which is a reference to the Blackfoot Legend====

====2 – In the &amp;#34;land&amp;#34; section, the aff focuses on how the Wind died and located a generic argument about loss of land to the United States. This references the story, but is incoherent. Blackfoot is predominantly from Canada not the United States====
NLA ~~~’11
(Native Languages of the Americas website &amp;#34;Native Languages of the Americas: 
Blackfoot (Siksika, Peigan, Piegan, Kainai, Blackfeet)&amp;#34; 2011 ~~~~http://www.native-languages.org/blackfoot-legends.htm-http://www.native-languages.org/blackfoot-legends.htm~~~~, TSW)

The first three nations are in Alberta, Canada, and the fourth is in Montana. (&amp;#34;Blackfeet,&amp;#34; though the official name of this tribe, is actually a misnomer given to them by white authorities; the word is not plural in the Blackfoot language, and some Blackfoot people in Montana resist this label.) The Blackfoot were nomadic plains hunters, traditional enemies of the Shoshone and Nez Perce. There are about 14,000 Blackfoot Indians today all told. 


====3 – In the &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; section, the aff focuses on death of THE &amp;#34;Indian&amp;#34; language, which posits a singular language about these groups. That denies Blackfoot culture as language is distinct – prefer our ev, it comes from a member of the Blackfoot Nation====
Bullchild 95
(Percy, 66-year-old member of the Blackfoot nation, passes on the oral history of his tribe in traditional stories he himself heard from his elders in &amp;#34;Native Heritage,&amp;#34; ed. Arlene Hirschfelder, p. 69 – Kurr)

At the very beginning of the lives of Mudman and Ribwoman, where the few 
AND
time, none of those groups could even begin to understand the others.


====4 - The aff fails to push to explore the real people behind the story and their arguments. Instead they only explore the &amp;#34;Indian&amp;#34; generically, which links back into their own criticism.====
Carson 06
(James Taylor, Queens University Kingston, Ontario, Canada; &amp;#34;American Historians and Indians,&amp;#34; The Historical Journal, 49: 921–933 – Kurr) 

Recent studies, such as Conn~~~’s, that deconstruct the object of the ~~~’Indian~~~’ 
AND
a part of the uniquely American intellectual fetishism of the ~~~’Indian~~~’.16


===AT: Markers===

====Their only argument on the link question coming out of the 2AC is that there are specific markers between all Indians. This is another link into our argument. Their Grande evidence also doesn~~~’t do any work on this distinction, choosing only to call this group &amp;#34;Indians&amp;#34;====

====Different native groups have different languages. Our 1NC evidence says that most of them cannot even understand one another anymore.====

====Their interp says that we should lump all groups together. This could even include groups that the Blackfoot Nation often waged war against like the Gros Ventre, Shoshone, Crow, and Cree. ====

====Individual affiliation is preferred – aff destroys individual cultures====
Christian Berry, 2006, Cherokee writer and producer of AllThingsCherokee.com, http://www.allthingscherokee.com/articles_culture_events_070101.html accessed Oct 31 2007.
In the end, the term you choose to use (as an Indian or 
AND
also show that you listened when they told what tribe they belonged to.


===2NC Impact Debate===

====Four impacts to these links.====


====First, the aff~~~’s marginalization of Blackfoot Nation culture disrespects their sovereignty and undermines cultural survival====
Helton 03
(Taiawagi, Associate Professor of Law, University of Oklahoma College of Law. LL.M. 2001, Yale Law School; J.D. 1999, University of Tulsa College of Law; B.A. 1995, The Ohio State University; &amp;#34;Nation Building in Indian Country: The Blackfoot Constitutional Review,&amp;#34; 13 Kan. J.L. %26 Pub. Pol~~~’y 1 – Kurr)

At the outset, the Constitution stresses the autonomy of the Blackfoot Nation, n357 
AND
require a remarkable two-thirds majority of representatives to take effect. n364


====Second, the aff creats an ideal &amp;#34;Indian&amp;#34; by creating a singular notion of what an &amp;#34;Indian&amp;#34; should be instead of evaluating the particular group they are talking about. This reifies racial lines separating these groups from whites====
Carson 06
(James Taylor, Queens University Kingston, Ontario, Canada; &amp;#34;American Historians and Indians,&amp;#34; The Historical Journal, 49: 921–933 – Kurr) 

What is most striking, however, is how, in both Silverman~~~’s and Merritt~~~’s 
AND
historical racial relic that has found its way into modern historiographical language.24


====Third, the aff~~~’s use of the word &amp;#34;Indian&amp;#34; recreates &amp;#34;us/them&amp;#34; binaries that prevent an understanding of Indian culture – turns the aff impacts from the Byrd and Memmi cards about culture====
Carson 06
(James Taylor, Queens University Kingston, Ontario, Canada; &amp;#34;American Historians and Indians,&amp;#34; The Historical Journal, 49: 921–933 – Kurr) 
In her recent exploration of ~~~’Indian~~~’ intellectuals in the late nineteenth-century United 
AND
present, and enable us to tell stories of creation rather than destruction.


====Fourth, The aff~~~’s failure to acknowledge individual affiliation ignores the preference of these groups – turns their sovereignty args====
Hirschfelder 95
~~~~~~Arlene Hirschfelder, Nonfiction Writer  &amp;#34;Native Heritage&amp;#34;, GoogleBooks ~~~~~~

And finally, a point about terminology: There is probably no book about Indian 
AND
the United States prefer this spelling to Blackfoot, more popular in Canada.

===AT: Depoliticizing===

====Their last argument is this Churchill evidence that talks about pre-occupation with issues of word choice precludes a move towards action, however this question comes before all else. We cannot help a group when we are only colonizing them by what we choose to call them. Rejecting their word choice is a prereq to any sort of 1AC solvency.====

====Discursive analysis is key to policy making- language choices have profound implications on plan~~~’s desirability and implementation- rhetorical criticism should precede any flawed assessment of plan~~~’s instrumental benefits====
Gehrke ~~~’02
~~~~~~Pat J., PROF OF ENGLISH LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE @ UNIV OF SOUTH CAROLINA, CRITIQUE ARGUMENTS AS POLICY ANALYSIS: POLICY DEBATE BEYOND THE RATIONALIST PERSPECTIVE, PERSPECTIVES IN CONTROVERSY: SELECTED ESSAYS FROM CONTEMPORARY ARGUMENTATION AND DEBATE, P. 316-317~~~~~~

Interpretive perspectives on policy offer unique advantages in repairing our policy deliberation model; as 
AND
neatly separate policies from the language and advocacy that brings about their implementation.
