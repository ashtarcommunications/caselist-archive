&#xD;
Quite expectedly, the more doctrinaire of the non-interventionists take pains to deny &#xD;
AND&#xD;
displacement is Eland~’s account of American intervention in the Korean and Vietnam wars:&#xD;
After North Korea invaded, the Truman administration intervened merely for the purpose of a &#xD;
AND&#xD;
pres- tige, and perceived resolve. (Eland 2004, 64)&#xD;
Of course, the motive of &amp;#34;reputation,&amp;#34; to the extent that it exists &#xD;
AND&#xD;
and their ~’rogue~’ state sponsors without those gold- plated white elephants.&amp;#34;&#xD;
The underlying notion of &amp;#34;the security bureaucracies . . . looking for new enemies&#xD;
AND&#xD;
-industrial complex fat and happy.&amp;#34; Or, in the same section:&#xD;
In the nation~’s capital, vested interests, such as the law enforcement bureaucracies . . . routinely take advantage of &amp;#34;crises&amp;#34;to satisfy parochial desires. Similarly, many corporations use crises to get pet projects— a.k.a. pork—funded by the government. And national security crises, because of people~’s fears, are especially ripe opportunities to grab largesse. (Ibid., 182)&#xD;
Thus, &amp;#34;bureaucratic-politics&amp;#34; theory, which once made several reputa- &#xD;
AND&#xD;
making among libertarian observers. As Eland (2004, 203) summarizes:&#xD;
Public-choice theory argues ~~[that~~] the government itself can develop sepa- rate interests from its citizens. The government reflects the interests of powerful pressure groups and the interests of the bureaucracies and the bureaucrats in them. Although this problem occurs in both foreign and domestic policy, it may be more severe in foreign policy because citizens pay less attention to policies that affect them less directly.&#xD;
There is, in this statement of public-choice theory, a certain ambiguity, and a certain degree of contradiction: Bureaucrats are supposedly, at the same time, subservient to societal interest groups and autonomous from society in general.&#xD;
This journal has pioneered the argument that state autonomy is a likely consequence of the &#xD;
AND&#xD;
about what strategies, forces, and weapons are required for national defense.&#xD;
Ironically, &amp;#34;public choice&amp;#34;—not even a species of economics, but rather &#xD;
AND&#xD;
the playing out of official roles, transcends merely personal or parochial imperatives.&#xD;
My treatment of &amp;#34;role&amp;#34; differs from that of the bureaucratic-politics theorists&#xD;
AND&#xD;
empirically—to the need for a broader and generic treatment of role.&#xD;
Roles (all theorists state) give rise to &amp;#34;expectations&amp;#34; of performance. My point is that virtually every governmental role, and especially national-security roles, and particularly the roles of the uniformed mili- tary, embody expectations of devotion to the &amp;#34;national interest&amp;#34;; rational- ity in the derivation of policy at every functional level; and objectivity in the treatment of parameters, especially external parameters such as &amp;#34;threats&amp;#34; and the power and capabilities of other nations.&#xD;
Sub-rational models (such as &amp;#34;public choice&amp;#34;) fail to take into &#xD;
AND&#xD;
and uncorrrupt, because personal cheating and even egregious aggrandizement are conspicuously discouraged.&#xD;
My own direct observation suggests that defense decision-makers attempt to &amp;#34;frame&amp;#34; the structure of the problems that they try to solve on the basis of the most accurate intelligence. They make it their business to know where the threats come from. Thus, threats are not &amp;#34;socially constructed&amp;#34; (even though, of course, some values are).&#xD;
A major reason for the rationality, and the objectivity, of the process is &#xD;
AND&#xD;
or to a lack of sufficient imagination to exploit opportunities for personal profit.&#xD;
