To make matters worse a cyber attack that can take out a civilian power grid, for example could also cripple the U.S. military.¶ The senator notes that is that the same power grids that supply cities and towns, stores and gas stations, cell towers and heart monitors also power “every military base in our country.”¶ “Although bases would be prepared to weather a short power outage with backup diesel generators, within hours, not days, fuel supplies would run out”, he said.¶ Which means military command and control centers could go dark.¶ Radar systems that detect air threats to our country would shut¶ Down completely.¶ “Communication between commanders and their troops would also go silent. And many weapons systems would be left without either fuel or electric power”, said Senator Grassley.¶ “So in a few short hours or days, the mightiest military in the world would be left scrambling to maintain base functions”, he said.¶ We contacted the Pentagon and officials confirmed the threat of a cyber attack is something very real.¶ Top national security officials—including the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the Director of the National Security Agency, the Secretary of Defense, and the CIA Director— have said, “preventing a cyber attack and improving the nation’s electric grids is among the most urgent priorities of our country” (source: Congressional Record).¶ So how serious is the Pentagon taking all this?¶ Enough to start, or end a war over it, for sure (see video: Pentagon declares war on cyber attacks http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kVQrp_D0kYandfeature=relmfu ).¶ A cyber attack today against the US could very well be seen as an “Act of War” and could be met with a “full scale” US military response.¶ That could include the use of “nuclear weapons”, if authorized by the President.

Martin ‘10
(Donald, Employee of the Aerospace Corporation, A History of US Military Satellite Communication Systems, Aerospace Corporation Magazine, http://www.aero.org/publications/crosslink/winter2002/01.html, )

U.S. military satellite communications have improved and expanded greatly over the past four decades, from SCORE through DSCS III, UFO, and Milstar. Capabilities have grown dramatically with the development of satellite and electronics technologies. Higher-power and wider-bandwidth satellites have enabled increased information transmission to an ever-wider assortment of terminal types deployed with an increasing number and variety of military units. Throughout this history, and now, Aerospace has been involved in every phase of development and deployment of DOD satellite communication systems, from concept development and requirements definition through design and test reviews to launch preparations and on-orbit testing and operations. Aerospace regularly applies lessons learned in the course of one program to all DOD satellite programs. As military satellite communication systems improve, they continue to provide information superiority to the U.S. military. This enables our military forces to remain dominant in the increasing speed and diversity of their actions during times of peace as well as times of conflict.
