To make matters worse a cyber attack that can take out a civilian power grid, for example could also cripple the U.S. military.¶ The senator notes that is that the same power grids that supply cities and towns, stores and gas stations, cell towers and heart monitors also power &amp;#34;every military base in our country.&amp;#34;¶ &amp;#34;Although bases would be prepared to weather a short power outage with backup diesel generators, within hours, not days, fuel supplies would run out&amp;#34;, he said.¶ Which means military command and control centers could go dark.¶ Radar systems that detect air threats to our country would shut¶ Down completely.¶ &amp;#34;Communication between commanders and their troops would also go silent. And many weapons systems would be left without either fuel or electric power&amp;#34;, said Senator Grassley.¶ &amp;#34;So in a few short hours or days, the mightiest military in the world would be left scrambling to maintain base functions&amp;#34;, he said.¶ We contacted the Pentagon and officials confirmed the threat of a cyber attack is something very real.¶ Top national security officials—including the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the Director of the National Security Agency, the Secretary of Defense, and the CIA Director— have said, &amp;#34;preventing a cyber attack and improving the nation~~~’s electric grids is among the most urgent priorities of our country&amp;#34; (source: Congressional Record).¶ So how serious is the Pentagon taking all this?¶ Enough to start, or end a war over it, for sure (see video: Pentagon declares war on cyber attacks http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kVQrp_D0kY%26feature=relmfu ).¶ A cyber attack today against the US could very well be seen as an &amp;#34;Act of War&amp;#34; and could be met with a &amp;#34;full scale&amp;#34; US military response.¶ That could include the use of &amp;#34;nuclear weapons&amp;#34;, if authorized by the President.

Combating proliferation with US leadership¶ Reactor safety itself notwithstanding, many argue that the 
AND
reactors are mitigated and concerns over the widespread distribution of nuclear fuel allayed.



====Proliferation risks nuclear war due to brinkmanship games- questions of deterrence miss the point.====

**Kroenig 12**

First and foremost, proliferation optimists do not appear to understand contemporary deterrence theory. 
AND
reveal the shortcomings of their analysis and fail to make a compelling case.



====Proliferation draws major powers in to regional disputes====

**Kroenig 9**

There is direct evidence that regional conflicts involving nuclear powers can ¶ encourage power-
AND
the United States would never allow an extended conflict in nuclear South Asia. 


====That leads to great power war====

Leaders in power-projecting states also fear that regional instability set off by nuclear
AND
another dangerous flash-point in the uncertain Sino-American strategic relationship.  


====US investment in SMRs key to beat china====

**Chu ~~~’10**

Perhaps most importantly, investing in nuclear energy will position America to lead in a

, eliminating the plutonium that critics say could be used for nuclear weapons.


====Without increasing nuclear technology, we lose out to China in nuclear leadership. The impact is Asian influence and proliferation.====

**Cullinane ~~~’11**

Due to a confluence of events the United States has recently focused more attention on 
AND
with very unsavory governments seems likely to increase the risks involving nuclear material.


====U.S. leadership in Asia solves multiple scenarios for war====

**Goh 8 **

This is the main structural dilemma: as long as the United States does not 
AND
as a result of not doing so would appear to be much worse.



====Asian wars go nuclear====

**Landy 2k**

Unlike private industry, the military does not face the same regulatory and congressional hurdles

Due to a confluence of events the United States has recently focused more attention on 
AND
with very unsavory governments seems likely to increase the risks involving nuclear material.



====U.S. leadership in Asia solves multiple scenarios for war====

This is the main structural dilemma: as long as the United States does not 
AND
as a result of not doing so would appear to be much worse.


====Asian wars go nuclear====

**Landy 2k**

(Jonathan, Knight Ridder, lexis)

Few if any experts think China and Taiwan, North Korea and South Korea,

The most dangerous source of instability in Asia is a rising China seeking to reassert 
AND
logistical tail but deep inside the reach of a large and rising power.


====High tensions make compromise unlikely- US leadership is key to forcing multilateral agreement====

The risk of conflict in the South China Sea is significant. China, Taiwan
AND
employ more aggressive means to intercept U.S. ships and aircraft.

====US-China war goes nuclear====

Lee J. **Hunkovic** — professor at American Military University, **09**, ~~&amp;#34;The Chinese-Taiwanese Conflict Possible Futures of a Confrontation between China, Taiwan and the United States of America&amp;#34;, American Military University, p.54~~

A war between China, Taiwan and the United States has the potential to escalate

Moore ’04 – Dir. Center for Security Law @ University of Virginia, 7-time Presidential appointee, and Honorary Editor of the American Journal of International Law, Solving the War Puzzle: Beyond the Democratic Peace, John Norton Moore, pages 41-2.
If major interstate war is predominantly a product of a synergy between a potential nondemocratic

are useful if they reflect the real world better than previously held paradigms. 
In the complex world of foreign affairs and the war puzzle, perfection is unlikely. No general construct will fit all cases even in the restricted category of &amp;#34;major interstate war&amp;#34;; there are simply too many variables. We should insist, however, on testing against the real world and on results that suggest enhanced usefulness over other constructs. In testing the hypothesis, we can test it for consistency with major wars; that is, in looking, for example, at the principal interstate wars in the twentieth century, did they present both a nondemocratic aggressor and an absence of effective deterrence?&amp;#39; And although it is by itself not going to prove causation, we might also want to test the hypothesis against settings of potential wars that did not occur. That is, in nonwar settings, was there an absence of at least one element of the synergy? We might also ask questions about the effect of changes on the international system in either element of the synergy; that is, what, in general, happens when a totalitarian state makes a transition to stable democracy or vice versa? And what, in general, happens when levels of deterrence are dramatically increased or decreased?
