====&amp;#34;Resolved&amp;#34; proves the framework for the resolution is to enact a policy. ====
**Words and Phrases 64 Permanent Edition**
Definition of the word &amp;#34;resolve,&amp;#34; given by Webster is &amp;#34;to express an opinion or determination by resolution or vote; as ~~~’it was resolved by the legislature;&amp;#34; It is of similar force to the word &amp;#34;enact,&amp;#34; which is defined by Bouvier as meaning &amp;#34;to establish by law&amp;#34;. 


====The USFG is the government in Washington D.C.====
**Encarta 2k http://encarta.msn.com**
 &amp;#34;The federal government of the United States is centered in Washington DC&amp;#34;

====	1. Topicality – they don~~~’t defend the resolution, which is a voting issue to preserve competitive equity and jurisdictional integrity====

====	2. Fairness – their framework allows infinite non-falsifiable, unpredictable, totalizing, and personal claims – impossible to be neg====

====	3. Switch-side debate – spending every round theorizing about your K is unproductive – you cannot know your argument is true unless you consider both sides of it====

====	4. No offense – you can read this arg when you~~~’re negative – to win this round, they have to prove why reading this aff and not being topical is good====

====	5. Topicality before advocacy – vote negative to say that you think they are not topical, not that you don~~~’t believe in their project====




====This is an a priori issue====
**Shively, 2k** (Assistant Prof Political Science at Texas A%26M, Ruth Lessl, Partisan Politics and Political Theory, p. 181-2)JFS
The requirements given thus far are primarily negative. The ambiguists must say &amp;#34;no
AND
. In other words, contestation rests on some basic agreement or harmony.


====Limits are key – infinite political theories exist, artificial limits are key ====
**Lutz 2k** (Donald S. Professor of Polisci at Houston, Political Theory and Partisan Politics p. 39-40)JFS
Aristotle notes in the Politics that political theory simultaneously proceeds at three levels—discourse 
AND
and clarity it lends to an analysis and comparison of ac¬tual political systems. 

====We control external impacts – abandoning politics causes war, slavery, and authoritarianism ====
Boggs 2k (CAROL BOGGS, PF POLITICAL SCIENCE – SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, 00, THE END OF POLITICS, 250-1)
But it is a very deceptive and misleading minimalism.  While Oakeshott debunks political mechanisms 
AND
run counter to the facile antirationalism of Oakeshott~~~’s Burkean muddling-through theories.

====Policymakers have to act as if we are on the wake of a revolution: this avoids the presumption that we are stuck in an capitalist economy that will never collapse. ====

Another &amp;#34;inhuman&amp;#34; dimension of the couple Virtue-Terror promoted by Robespierre is 
AND
of character demanded by the free government to which we have dared aspire.



====The aff~~~’s attempt to preserve a particular social group and their culture perpetuates capitalism – capitalism~~~’s global course homogenizes cultures====
Žižek 97 (Slavoj, International Director of Birkbeck Institute for Humanities @ U. of London, &amp;#34;Multiculturalism, or, the Cultural Logic of Multinational Capitalism,&amp;#34; http://libcom.org/library/multiculturism-or-the-cultural-logic-of-multinational-capitalism-Žižek)
And, mutatis mutandis, the same goes for today~~~’s capitalist who still clings to

people, despised for being caught in their narrow ethnic or community confines.

====Racial politics reentrenches and masks capitalist hierarchies====

====Resisting this reliance on economic evaluation is the ultimate ethical responsibility – the current social order guarantees social exclusion on a global scale ====
Zizek and Daly 2k4 (Slavoj and Glyn, Conversations with Zizek page 14-16)
For Zizek it is imperative that we cut through this Gordian knot of postmodern protocol

====We must resist the urge to intervene if we are to avoid the crisis sparked by peak capitalism and succeed in radically reorganizing the economy====

The concept of peak oil may apply more generally than its friends and foes realize
AND
decision-makers focused on meeting collective needs, both productive and environmental.

====Examining the desirability of capitalism is a prior question to the 1AC====
MESZAROS (Prof. Emeritus @ Univ. Sussex) 1995
~~~~~~[Istavan, Beyond Capital: Towards a Theory of Transition, // wyo 65~~~~~~]
The modern state as the comprehensive political command structure of capital — is both the

faithful to the Marxian concern with the ~~~’withering away~~~’ of the state.


====The affirmative~~~’s knowledge is not value-neutral, its production is contingent on a specific separation of labor that privileges a small scientific and military elite, and its employment actively sustains capital====

====The only option is to risk the impossible- we have an ethical obligation to imagine a socialist democracy, regardless of cost====
Marsh 95- Professor of Philosophy at Fordham University, PhD from Northwestern University
(James, Critique Action and Liberation, p 334-6)

We affirm, then, the ethical necessity of pursuing ethical community and democratic socialism 
AND
a repressive status quo whose interest lies in not having the veil pierced.

The capitalist class owns the factories, the banks, and transportation-the means 
AND
, civil and human rights of all working people are continually under attack.


====Capitalism racializes subjectivity in order to cause competition and destroy universal consciousness while sustaining white racism.  All of this is used to insulate the system of capital accumulation====

**San Juan (Fulbright Lecturer @ Univ. of Leuven, Belgium) 03**
~~~~~~[E., &amp;#34;Marxism and the Race/Class Problematic: A Re-Articulation&amp;#34;, p. online: http://clogic.eserver.org/2003/sanjuan.html~~~~~~]

It seems obvious that racism cannot be dissolved by instances of status mobility when sociohistorical 
AND
are dialectically conjoined in the reproduction of capitalist relations of exploitation and domination.
30. We might take a passage from Marx as a source of guidelines for developing a historical-materialist theory of racism which is not empiricist but dialectical in aiming for theorizing conceptual concreteness as a multiplicity of historically informed and configured determinations. This passage comes from a letter dated 9 April 1870 to Meyer and Vogt in which Marx explains why the Irish struggle for autonomy was of crucial significance for the British proletariat:
    . . . Every industrial and commercial center in England possesses a working class 
AND
at once the accomplice and stupid tool of the English rule in Ireland.
  This antagonism is artificially kept alive and intensified by the press, the pulpit, the comic papers, in short by all the means at the disposal of the ruling classes. This antagonism is the secret of the impotence of the English working class, despite its organization. It is the secret by which the capitalist class maintains its power. And that class is fully aware of it (quoted in Callinicos 1993).
Here Marx sketches three parameters for the sustained viability of racism in modern capitalist society
AND
the framework of its ideological/political hegemony in the metropolis and worldwide.
     31. Racism and nationalism are thus modalities in which class struggles articulate themselves 
AND
were (see San Juan 1998; 2002).~~~~~~[CON~~~’TD~~~~~~] ~~~~~~[CONT~~~’D~~~~~~]
     32. Racism arose with the creation and expansion of the capitalist world economy 
AND
propertied class—that is, capital accumulation. As John Rex noted,
    different ethnic groups are placed in relations of cooperation, symbiosis or conflict by 
AND
of a more generalized sort (1983, 403-05, 407).
Hence race relations and race conflict are necessarily structured by the larger totality of the political economy of a given society, as well as by modifications in the structure of the world economy. Corporate profit-making via class exploitation on an international/globalized scale, at bottom, still remains the logic of the world system of finance capitalism based on historically changing structures and retooled practices of domination and subordination.



===Case===

====Claims of environmental racism are flawed – studies show there is no discriminatory siting.====
Glasgow 5 (Joshua, Yale Law School JD candidate, Buffalo Environmental Law Journal, 13 Buff. Envt~~~’l L.J. 69, Fall, ln)
In addition to courtroom difficulties, the environmental justice movement was challenged by a number 
AND
-the-egg&amp;#34; dilemma has plagued the environmental justice literature. 32

====There is not a causal relationship between industrial areas and race – flawed EPA studies prove ====
Payne 00 (Henry: writer for New York Times, &amp;#34;Green redlining: how rules against &amp;#34;environmental racism&amp;#34; hurt poor minorities most of all,&amp;#34; http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1568/is_n5_v30/ai_21141903/print?tag=artBody;col1)
No matter what form the administration~~~’s environmental justice policy finally takes, the underlying question 
AND
is that blacks near the plant must be victims because they are black. 


====Alt cause - dumping, arson, and vandalism are the root cause of urban problems====
Essoka 3 (Dumbe, Dr. of philosophy @ Drexel, Brownfields Revitalization Projects:Displacement of the Dispossessed http://dspace.library.drexel.edu/handle/1860/206)
Regardless of type and location, brownfields have experienced a cycle of decline owing to 
AND
becoming unwanted legal, regulatory and financial burdens on the community and taxpayers.


====Environmental justice movements can~~~’t solve environmental racism.====
Yamamoto and Lyman 1 (Eric K, Hawaii Law School law prof., and Jen-L W, UC Berkeley visiting law prof., University of Colorado Law Review, 72 U. Colo. L. Rev. 311, Spring, p. 320-322, ln)
The established framework also assumes that fair distribution of physical burdens is the primary, 
AND
choices, the pluralism model cannot resolve all problems associated with environmental racism.
