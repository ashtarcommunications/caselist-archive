The United States Congress should immediately require a government-wide Quadrennial Energy Review
through a staged process to be completed by February 1st each year, concluded in entirety by February 1st, 2014, and every subsequent four years
led by the President in coordination with the Secretary of Energy as Executive Secretariat, giving them final authority over its content
to recommend goals, priorities and actions for implementation of a national energy policy

and will provide all necessary support for expedited build up of relevant analytic capabilities

The President and Executive Secretariat should immediately establish a policy determination to provide full support to make a top priority of the first stage of recommendations for establishing a matching funds programs, increase research and development funding and remove licensing restrictions for thorium power production in the United States.

The 50 States should provide full and upfront funding for all robust detailed design and engineering efforts and all licensing costs for _________.  The scope of such detailed design and engineering effort will include preparation of construction drawings; the specification of system components; procurement engineering, including the preparation of bid packages for suppliers; a general site layout, and all nonrecurring design and engineering work at the manufacturing site.

More robust detailed design and engineering efforts solve expedited license approval, cost confidence and widespread commercialization

Hezir, Principal, EOP Foundation, Inc., http://epic.uchicago.edu/sites/epic.uchicago.edu/files/uploads/SMRWhite_Paper_Dec.14.2011copy.pdf)

The study team learned during the study, which included comments received from the utilities and vendors who participated in the DOE Nuclear Power 2010 (NP-2010) program, that further delineation of the design and engineering for large (GW-scale) reactors would have likely resulted in firmer overnight cost quotes and, potentially, more expedited licensing approvals. This lesson – if learned – argues strongly that a key initial step for a robust SMR reprogram is to support the completion of detailed design and engineering (DDandE) work that is more expansive than the FOAKE effort. The scope of such a DDandE effort would include the preparation of construction drawings; the specification of system components; procurement engineering, including the preparation of bid packages for suppliers; a general site layout (that would then be adapted to individual plants); and all nonrecurring design and engineering work at the manufacturing site. These DDandE activities for the SMR program may have to be more expansive than the scope for the NP2010 FOAKE program. More robust engineering design work could facilitate the NRC design certification (DC) process, and additional design and engineering activity will be needed to integrate the design of SMR modules with site and manufacturing facility specifications. A more robust DDandE process also may reduce the tendency to “pancake” contingencies, so that fixed/firm cost estimates are established and, more importantly, supporting follow-on manufacturing and construction activities for SMRs are carried out.

Providing funding for robust DDE and licensing efforts is BY FAR MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR to reduce production costs and investment risks

Sensitivity results indicate that allocation of FOAK expenses is the most important parameter affecting the estimated cost of power produced. These are substantial expenses associated with final engineering, design certification, etc., that are generically labeled as FOAK expenses. The FOAK expense values we used for estimating the cost of power produced are the portion of that expense borne by the project, anticipating that arrangements could be made for some or all FOAK expenses to be borne by DOE, vendors, or direct congressional funding for that purpose. Figure 11 shows sensitivity results for FOAK expenses allocated to the project. FOAK expense is also the primary source of risk. DoD can limit this risk by negotiating project terms that ensure FOAK expense will be paid by DOE, direct congressional funding for that purpose, and/or by vendors. Risks that the project might not be pursued vigorously or might not operate as intended can be limited by appropriate contracts with vendors and contracting with a separate business entity for building and operating the power plant. The importance of this input parameter is further emphasized by observing that if no FOAK expense is allocated to the project and other input parameters are set at levels that imply higher costs, the highest estimated cost of electricity produced is only about $0.12. That estimate is associated with higher market rates for debt and equity, which are the input parameters that have the next most important influence on the cost of electricity produced.


And it’s the single fastest way to solve regulatory and licensing barriers
King 11
Marcus King, Ph.D., Center for Naval Analyses Project Director and Research Analyst for the Environment and Energy TeamLaVar Huntzinger, Thoi Nguyen, March 2011, Feasibility of Nuclear Power on U.S.Military Installations, www.cna.org/sites/default/files/research/Nuclear Power on Military Installations D0023932 A5.pdf

We identify three types of FOAK expenses: • Final detailed engineering for certification • Resolving FOAK licensing issues • Manufacturing engineering, tooling, and facilities. Completing final detailed engineering for certification will take about 2-3 years and is estimated to cost hundreds of millions of dollars. In addition, there are licensing issues related to small reactors that will need to be resolved. We assess the risks to public safety associated with the proposed small reactors are smaller than the risks associated with large reactors. In addition, the small reactors are designed to require less operator intervention. Consequently, there is general agreement that various safety requirements currently imposed on large reactors will be changed for small reactors. However, the precise details of such changes need to be worked out with the NRC. Resolving FOAK licensing issues will take a few years. Several years will be required to plan for and prepare all the details required for actual manufacturing—manufacturing engineering, tools, facilities, etc. Completing certification and licensing consists of working out and carefully documenting satisfactory answers to various questions and concerns. Therefore, the most important factor influencing the amount of calendar time required for certification and licensing is the intensity of effort and close attention that those seeking certification and licensing expend on accomplishing the objective. We estimate that total FOAK expenses could be about $800 million allocated among the different types as shown in Figure 6.

Funding Multiple DDE efforts solves

Funding diverse DDE efforts solves SMR competitiveness, lowers costs and overcomes licensing barriers
Rosner, et. al. ‘11 (Robert Rosner, Robert Rosner is an astrophysicist and founding director of the Energy Policy Institute at Chicago.

The goal of this stage of the study was a scoping analysis sufficient to develop a business case for future programmatic and policy decisions, including options for government incentives. This scoping analysis does support a competitive position for n th -of-a-kind (NOAK) SMRs, based on best achievable overnight cost estimates. However, one of the limitations at this stage of the analysis is reliance on projections of best achievable costs for the NOAK SMRs based on limited engineering design work. The study team recommends that the “lessons learned” be adopted from the NP2010 program. Detailed design and engineering work should be supported for at least several designs to promote competition and arrive at more robust design solutions, with firmer cost estimates, for the earlier SMR plants, as well as to fully exercise the NRC licensing process (this will be discussed in Appendix B).

Romey will reinstate the gag rule
Desert News, 2-10-2012 http://www.deseretnews.com/article/705399188/Romney-commits-to-defund-United-Nations-Population-Fund-Planned-Parenthood.html?pg=2

In a speech before CPAC Friday, Mitt Romney announced steps he would take against abortion, inluding cutting off federal funds to Planned Parenhood, if elected president. “Mine will be a pro-life presidency,” he said. “On day one, I will reinstate the Mexico City policy. I will cut off funding for the United Nations Population Fund, which supports China’s barbaric One Child Policy.” The Mexico City policy prohibits funding organizations that promote abortion in other countries. UNFPA spokesman Omar Gharzeddine denied Romney&amp;#39;s accusation that UNFPA promotes China&amp;#39;s coercive family planning. Gharzeddine said the UN Population Fund “promotes voluntary family planning and human rights in more than 150 countries, including China. It does not support coercion in family planning, coercive abortions or forced sterilizations anywhere in the world.” He also said UNFPA “highly appreciates the political and financial support of the United States.” But Jeanne Head, National Right to Life vice president for International Affairs, responded to KSL in support of Romney&amp;#39;s claim: “There is no doubt that the United Nations Population Fund participates in the management of China&amp;#39;s one-child population control policy which has resulted in countless forced abortions throughout the country. Sadly, right this very minute, the United States government is providing funding to the UNFPA.” Congressman Chris Smith, R-New Jersey, also said he believes the UN Population Fund supports China&amp;#39;s one child policy. He recently traveled to China to investigate and reported his findings before the House Foreign Affairs Committee in October. China&amp;#39;s “one child per couple policy is the most egregious systematic attack on mothers ever,&amp;#34; he said before the House committee.&amp;#34;Yet the UNPFA incorporates and defers to that policy in its programs.” The Mexico City policy, also known as the &amp;#34;Global Gag Rule,&amp;#34; was originally enacted by President Ronald Reagan, has been through a series of rescissions and adoptions in the past three decades — depending on the current US president&amp;#39;s party affiliation. President Bill Clinton rescinded the policy; President George W. Bush adopted it again, but President Barack Obama, during his first week in office, rescinded it yet again.
That causes overpopulation
San Gabriel Valley Tribune 2005(“Earth staggering under expanding population” July 11, lexis)

Our past efforts have proven very successful: Because of years of hard work by the family-planning and reproductive- health community, total world fertility has declined from six children per woman in the 1960s to fewer than three today. But as the largest youth generation in history enters their reproductive years, our work is far from over. Unfortunately, the Bush administration is doing everything in its power to stifle women&amp;#39;s rights and jeopardize the future of our planet. For four years running, President Bush has blocked funds that Congress has appropriated to the United Nations Population Fund UNFPA, the largest supplier of reproductive health-care and family-planning services worldwide. As one of his first acts in office, Bush imposed the Global Gag Rule, which restricts foreign NGOs that receive money from the United States for family-planning services from using their own funds to provide legal abortion services, give counseling or referrals for abortion, or petition their own governments to liberalize restrictive abortion laws. The results of this policy were easy to predict: Clinics are closing in Kenya, and contraceptive supplies have dried up in Ethiopia.

Overpopulation causes extinction 
CBD- Center for Biological Diversity 11 (The Center for Biological Diversity works through science, law and creative media to secure a future for all species, “OVERPOPULATION: A KEY FACTOR IN SPECIES EXTINCTION,” citing data as recent as October 2011, http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/campaigns/overpopulation/index.html)

The world’s human population doubled from 1 to 2 billion between 1800 and 1930, and then doubled again by 1975. At the end of October 2011, it surpassed 7 billion. This staggering increase and the massive consumption it drives are overwhelming the planet’s finite resources. We’ve already witnessed the devastating effects of overpopulation on biodiversity: Species abundant in North America two centuries ago — from the woodland bison of West Virginia and Arizona’s Merriam’s elk to the Rocky Mountain grasshopper and Puerto Rico’s Culebra parrot — have been wiped out by growing human numbers. As the world’s population grows unsustainably, so do its unyielding demands for water, land, trees and fossil fuels — all of which come at a steep price for already endangered plants and animals. Most biologists agree we’re in the midst of the Earth’s sixth mass extinction event; species are disappearing about 1,000 times faster than is typical of the planet’s history. This time, though, it isn’t because of geologic or cosmic forces but unsustainable human population growth. Today’s global human population is over 7 billion. Every day, the planet sees a net gain of roughly 250,000 people. If the pace continues, we’ll be on course to reach 8 billion by 2020 and 9 billion by 2050. By any ecological measure, Homo sapiens sapiens has exceeded its sustainable population size. Just a single human waste product — greenhouse gas — has drastically altered the chemistry of the planet’s atmosphere and oceans, causing global warming and ocean acidification. In the United States, which has the world’s third largest population after China and India, the fertility rate peaked in 2007 at its highest level since 1971 before dropping off slightly due to the recent economic recession. At 2.1 children per woman, the U.S. fertility rate remains the highest among developed nations, which average around 1.6. The current U.S. population exceeds 300 million and is projected to grow 50 percent by 2050. The mission of the Center for Biological Diversity is to stop the planetary extinction crisis wiping out rare plants and animals around the world. Explosive, unsustainable human population growth is an essential root cause of this crisis. We can reduce our own population to an ecologically sustainable level in a number of ways, including the empowerment of women, education of all people, universal access to birth control and a societal commitment to ensuring that all species are given a chance to live and thrive. All of these steps will decrease human poverty and overcrowding, raise our standard of living and sustain the lives of plants, animals and ecosystems everywhere.

Overpopulation threatens agricultural collapse and humanity’s extinction
Mona L. Hymel, Associate Professor of Law, University of Arizona College of Law, November 1998, North Carolina Law Review

As the twentieth century draws to a close, humanity faces the daunting prospect of supporting its population without inducing catastrophic and irreversible destruction on Earth&amp;#39;s life-support systems. Human and agricultural fertility are on a collision course: the stork is threatening to overtake the plow. 1 More than 600 of the world&amp;#39;s most distinguished scientists, including a majority of the living Nobel laureates in the sciences, issued a warning to humanity in 1992. 2 They warned that only a few decades remained to stop unrestrained population growth and environmentally devastating economic practices before efforts to achieve a sustainable future &amp;#34;will be lost and prospects for humanity immeasurably diminished.&amp;#34; 3 In 1994, the world&amp;#39;s scientific academies echoed this warning. 4 The very rapid rates of human-induced climate change, combined with fragmentation of natural habitats for agriculture and development activities, are unprecedented.

Overpopulation makes economic collapse inevitable
Lester Brown, founder of the WorldWatch Institute, April 2004,

NOVA: What happens if countries can&amp;#39;t stabilize their populations? Will they just eventually break
down? Brown: One of the things that&amp;#39;s happening in the world today as our numbers have passed the six
billion mark is that in order to support six billion-plus people, we are over-consuming the Earth&amp;#39;s natural capital. Forests are shrinking, fisheries are collapsing, water tables are falling, soils are eroding, grasslands are deteriorating from over-grazing. This over-consumption of natural capital artificially inflates economic output, including food output. We are developing a bubble economy. The worrisome thing about bubble economies is that if you can&amp;#39;t shrink the bubble, eventually it will burst. Then you have serious problems. We&amp;#39;ve seen bubble economies develop in the high-tech stock market in the U.S. We saw the value of high-tech stocks drop by 60 percent or so. We saw this with real estate in Japan a decade ago, when suddenly the bubble burst overnight and real estate prices also dropped by 60 percent.
