There are no sharp … voices heard on this matter.


 

===Contention Three is Waste:===

====Fusion solves fission waste and Yucca storage. Even if full-fusion is distant, fusion neutron harnessing isn~’t. ====

**UT~’9 ** 
(This is a Multi-Disciplinary release from the University of Texas – it internally quotes Physics Professors, Mechanical Engineers, and Fusion Experts. &amp;#34;Nuclear Fusion-Fission Hybrid Could Destroy Nuclear Waste and Contribute to Carbon-Free Energy Future&amp;#34;, 1-27, This article also appears in This article also appears in Science Daily on Jan 29^^th^^ – both web addresses are included: http://www.utexas.edu/news/2009/01/27/nuclear_hybrid/-http://www.utexas.edu/news/2009/01/27/nuclear_hybrid/; http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/01/090127131654.htm)
&amp;#34;We have created a way … in the near term.



====Yucca storage harms billions. Our author~’s qual~’d and beats &amp;#34;exaggeration&amp;#34; accusations. ====

Comarow ~’1 
(David Comarow has a multi-disciplinary background and is tough to pigeon-hole as someone that could logically be from a singular epistemological school of thought. David is a former faculty member of the College of Southern Nevada, where he established the Solar Energy Technology Training Program and the Center for Appropriate Technology in 1976. He holds a BS in biology from State University of New York, Albany, an MS in Urban Studies from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and a JD from California Western School of Law, He is also an Advisory Board Member of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society (SSCS) – a international non-profit, marine wildlife conservation organization. &amp;#34;Yucca Mountain: Time to Think the Unthinkable&amp;#34;, Testimony presented at US Department of Energy Public Hearing, 12-8, http://www.nuclearfiles.org/menu/key-issues/nuclear-energy/issues/yucca-mountain/yucca-mountain-testimony-comarow_2001-12-08.htm)
None of that is impossible, and therefore none of that is unthinkable. We are not talking about the short-term or even long-term economic prosperity of Las Vegas. We are talking about nothing … death of billions.



====And, on-site storage bad – already harms people now.====

**Ross ~’11**
Sherwood Ross is a Miami-based consultant and columnist. He has reported for the Chicago Daily News, regularly writes for Reuters, and has worked as a columnist for wire services. Global Research, November 10, 2011 – http://www.globalresearch.ca/fukushima-japan-s-second-nuclear-disaster/?print=1
The thousands … effectively told.


====Yes, Yucca accident – quakes, human error or water.====

In several hundred thousand … error mankind ever made. 


====The Squo and K alts must explain how they~’ll get rid of current waste. It~’s dangerous, goes to sea, and there~’s few options. ====

**Cohen ~’12**
Dr. Martin Cohen has a multi-disciplinary background and is tough to pigeon-hole as someone that could logically be from a singular epistemological school of thought. He studied philosophy and social science at Sussex University. He obtained a teaching qualification at Keele University and his PhD in philosophy of education from the University of Exeter. After research posts at universities in Britain and Australia, Cohen moved to France to concentrate on journalism. He is active in several environmental causes. Cohen has been a frequent contributor and reviewer for the New Statesman (on environmental issues) and the Guardian (London) (on the role of computers in education). He is also co-author of the published book The Doomsday Machine: the high price of nuclear energy.

The history of ~’fly-tipping~’ nuclear … USA perfectly reveals.
