S. 1703 would legislate a required QER, and this would ¶ clearly reinforce the PCAST recommendation, and I support that.¶ Two comments: The faster schedule put forward in S. 1703 ¶ relative to the PCAST recommendation I think could certainly be handled in equilibrium, but it wouldn~’t require, as already ¶ indicated, that 2012 be used effectively to build up DOE ¶ analytical capacity if the accelerated schedule has any chance ¶ of being met.&#xD;

AND
a base far away from other installation facilities then additional security would be needed

 to control access and conduct patrols; however, a remote location would likely be inconsistent with the objective for building the plant. For example, if the plant is being built to provide better energy assurance then it is better to locate it near the facilities that will consume the power.

===Manufacturing Turn===

====Unfair Chinese competition undermines domestic solar manufacturing – strong manufacturing solves price effects and key to competitiveness====
**Hart and Gordon, 12  **
**(Melanie and Kate, Melanie Hart is a Policy Analyst on China Energy and Climate Policy at the Center for American Progress. Kate Gordon is Vice President for Energy Policy at the Center, http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/green/news/2012/05/16/11592/5-myths-and-realities-about-u-s-china-solar-trade-competition/)**

Myth U.S. manufacturers should accept that they cannot compete with China Reality 
AND
precisely in order to maintain our competitive edge in innovation and advanced manufacturing. 


====Key to prevent long term price fixing – internal link turns their offense====
**Hart and Gordon, 12  **
**(Melanie and Kate, Melanie Hart is a Policy Analyst on China Energy and Climate Policy at the Center for American Progress. Kate Gordon is Vice President for Energy Policy at the Center, http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/green/news/2012/05/16/11592/5-myths-and-realities-about-u-s-china-solar-trade-competition/)**

The other effect of a government-created Chinese monopoly on solar panels is that 
AND
good for consumers. The eventual price fixing, however, hurts everyone.


====Supply side policies are key – tariff price effects wont deter – also proves our counterplan outweighs====
**Hart and Gordon, 12  **
**(Melanie and Kate, Melanie Hart is a Policy Analyst on China Energy and Climate Policy at the Center for American Progress. Kate Gordon is Vice President for Energy Policy at the Center, http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/green/news/2012/05/16/11592/5-myths-and-realities-about-u-s-china-solar-trade-competition/)**

Finally, the fact is that whether or not China is violating trade rules, 
AND
. That is the real key to U.S. market success.


===Trade relations turn===

====No trade war – failure to enforce sends signal undermining Chinese compliance across the board – far larger internal link to economy and US China Trade====
**Hart and Gordon, 12  **
**(Melanie and Kate, Melanie Hart is a Policy Analyst on China Energy and Climate Policy at the Center for American Progress.

Myth Imposing tariffs would trigger a trade war with China, and that must be 
AND
playing by the rules across all its industries, not just solar manufacturing.


====Removing anti dumping enforcement spurs political enforcement – which is worse, causes trade war and market uncertainty====
**Hart and Gordon, 12  **
**(Melanie and Kate, Melanie Hart is a Policy Analyst on China Energy and Climate Policy at the Center for American Progress. Kate Gordon is Vice President for Energy Policy at the Center, http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/green/news/2012/05/16/11592/5-myths-and-realities-about-u-s-china-solar-trade-competition/)**

Myth U.S-China trade tensions are bigger than solar so they shouldn~’t 
AND
lobbyists (including Chinese-funded lobbyists) more influence over these decisions. 



**Maintaining the tariffs spurs leverage for a negotiated solution – captures best of both worlds**
**Hart and Gordon, 12  **
**(Melanie and Kate, Melanie Hart is a Policy Analyst on China Energy and Climate Policy at the Center for American Progress. Kate Gordon is Vice President for Energy Policy at the Center, http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/green/news/2012/05/16/11592/5-myths-and-realities-about-u-s-china-solar-trade-competition/)**

The bottom line is that a true negotiated agreement with China, if China is 
AND
its negotiating leverage in bilateral trade disputes. We should do the same. 

====Not unique and empirically false – tons of US trade actions====
**Gu and Prasad, 11**
Eswar Prasad Senior Fellow Global Economy and Development, Grace Gu Department of Economics, Cornell University, 1/17/11, http://www.brookings.edu/research/opinions/2011/01/13-us-china-prasad
On trade, the Obama administration has taken an aggressive approach. It has instituted 
AND
where it feels that China is subverting the established rules of the game.


====Capitulation causes trade violations across the board – collapses competitiveness and economy====
**Hart and Gordon, 12  **
**(Melanie and Kate, Melanie Hart is a Policy Analyst on China Energy and Climate Policy at the Center for American Progress. Kate Gordon is Vice President for Energy Policy at the Center, http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/green/news/2012/05/16/11592/5-myths-and-realities-about-u-s-china-solar-trade-competition/)**

Myth The U.S. solar market would be much better off if SolarWorld 
AND
complaints, even if other sectors of the industry find those complaints inconvenient.



**Removing antidumping tariffs creates incentives for future Chinese political influence to deter companies from trade remedies**
**Hart and Gordon, 12  **
**(Melanie and Kate, Melanie Hart is a Policy Analyst on China Energy and Climate Policy at the Center for American Progress. Kate Gordon is Vice President for Energy Policy at the Center, http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/green/news/2012/05/16/11592/5-myths-and-realities-about-u-s-china-solar-trade-competition/)**

It is also important to note that in private conversations with this column~’s authors, 
AND
investigations are largely isolated from political pressure and less susceptible to Chinese interference.

==Counterplan==

===1NC===
The United States Federal Government should approve leasing of the Outer Continental Shelf for non drilling and production activities.

The United States Federal Government should maintain its restrictions on oil drilling in the Outer Continental Shelf.

The United States Federal Government should add to existing legal penalties for violations of restrictions on oil drilling in the Outer Continental Shelf an alternate penalty option allowing violators to choose penalization solely through entry into a Supplemental Environmental Program requiring payment of 1% of revenue from all violating activities to an Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion Trust Fund managed by dedicated non-profit organizations, conducted in co-ordination with, and with oversight by, the Department of Energy, to support the development and commercialization of Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion, with an initial focus on providing financing for a 10 megawatt pilot project demonstration plant. Implementation of the Supplemental Environmental Program should provide a shield from additional legal penalties stemming from the violating action, including citizen suits and penalties under state law.  In order to be eligible for the Supplemental Environmental Program, the violator must voluntarily report the prospective violation, agree to immediate voluntary inspection and inspection fees and be found in compliance with all other environmental and safety regulations.  Any conflicting federal laws and regulations should be modified to provide a narrow exemption for the above act.

Weak penalties do not alter the restriction but ensure it is functionally ignored

In order to distinguish an exchange restriction from a trade measure, the Fund chose not to give relevance to the purposes or the effects of the measure and to adopt, instead, a technical criterion that focuses on the method followed to design said measure.
An interpretation that considered the economic effects and purposes of the measures (taking into

After lengthy discussions, in 1960 the IMF Executive Board adopted Decision No. 1034-(60/27).46 This Decision clarified that the distinctive feature of a restriction on payments and transfers for current international transactions is &amp;#34;whether it involves a direct governmental limitation on the availability or use of exchange as such*.47 This is a limitation imposed directly on the use of currency in itself, for all purposes.

Viterbo 12 (Annamaria, Assistant Professor in International Law – University of Torino, PhD in International Economic Law – Bocconi University and Jean Monnet Fellow – European University Institute, International Economic Law and Monetary Measures: Limitations to States~’ Sovereignty and Dispute, p. 166)

In order to distinguish an exchange restriction from a trade measure, the Fund chose not to give relevance to the purposes or the effects of the measure and to adopt, instead, a technical criterion that focuses on the method followed to design said measure.
An interpretation that considered the economic effects and purposes of the measures (taking into 
AND
balance of payments reasons would have fallen within the competence of the Fund.
After lengthy discussions, in 1960 the IMF Executive Board adopted Decision No. 1034-(60/27).46 This Decision clarified that the distinctive feature of a restriction on payments and transfers for current international transactions is &amp;#34;whether it involves a direct governmental limitation on the availability or use of exchange as such*.47 This is a limitation imposed directly on the use of currency in itself, for all purposes.

But since the coming weeks and perhaps months will now be devoted to the next round of the budget battle, another problem for the president is that this could encroach on his second-term agenda.
In the afterglow of his reelection victory, Obama talked about making a serious push for immigration reform just as some Republicans were softening their opposition to a path toward citizenship for illegal immigrants. He also spoke of mounting an effort on climate change. And in the wake of the Newtown school massacre, the president promised to lead a legislative effort on gun control.
Yet he will need Republican support if any of those initiatives are to become reality. And a constant state of warfare over budget battles will make it hard to enlist Boehner~’s cooperation—without which Obama could be left without a signature second-term achievement.

Steven P. **Bucci**, Ph.D. is a Director, Douglas and Sarah Allison Center for Foreign Policy Studies at The Heritage Foundation **1-2**-2013 http://blog.heritage.org/2013/01/02/defending-defense-dont-just-delay-defense-sequestration-stop-it/-http://blog.heritage.org/2013/01/02/defending-defense-dont-just-delay-defense-sequestration-stop-it/

By delaying defense sequestration two months, President Obama and Congress have shown their unambiguous recognition that sequestration~’s automatic and indiscriminate cuts to the U.S. military pose clear dangers to national security. However, America~’s leaders must now match their recognition of this reality with the resolve required to definitively stop defense sequestration. Otherwise, they will end up throwing the military~’s servicemen and servicewomen off the fiscal cliff—and the nation off a strategic cliff.

====Obama has to leverage a favorable deal====
**Zasloff 1-2** – Jonathan, Professor of Law at UCLA, PhD in American Foreign Policy from Harvard and JD from Yale Law, &amp;#34;Obama~’s New Leverage: Implement The Defense Sequester&amp;#34;, Same Facts, 2013, http://www.samefacts.com/2013/01/national-security/obamas-new-leverage-implement-the-defense-sequester/

President Obama needs to use the leverage that the defense sequester gives him.  The 
AND
I get my own priorities in spending and revenue.  End of story. 
And conversely, if the President does not use this leverage, and instead agrees to benefit cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and crucial domestic priorities, he will have no one to blame but himself.

For developing countries, displaced populations are both a consequence of conflict and a cause of continuing conflict and instability. Forced displacement can obstruct peace processes, undermine attempts at economic development, and exacerbate intercommunal tensions. Refugee flows also can be a source of regional conflict, causing instability in neighboring countries, triggering external intervention, and sometimes providing armed refugee groups with base camps from which to conduct insurgency, armed resistance, and terrorist activities.

===Squo solves grid- clark===

====Status quo solves grid cyber vulnerability  ====
Paul **Clark 12**, MA Candidate, Intelligence/Terrorism Studies, American Military University; Senior Analyst, Chenega Federal Systems, 4/28/12, &amp;#34;The Risk of Disruption or Destruction of Critical U.S. Infrastructure by an Offensive Cyber Attack,&amp;#34; http://blog.havagan.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/The-Risk-of-Disruption-or-Destruction-of-Critical-U.S.-Infrastructure-by-an-Offensive-Cyber-Attack.pdf
An attack against the electrical grid is a reasonable threat scenario since power systems are 
AND
establish robust security guidelines and cyber security measures (Gohn and Wheelock 2010).

===no impact to failure + cyber===

====Zero impact to grid failures, even ones caused by cyber attacks ====
Douglas **Birch 10-1**, former foreign correspondent for the Associated Press and the Baltimore Sun who has written extensively on technology and public policy, 10/1/12, &amp;#34;Forget Revolution,&amp;#34; Foreign Policy, http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/10/01/forget_revolution?page=full
Government officials sometimes describe a kind of Hieronymus Bosch landscape when warning of the possibility 
AND
, and government offices. Americans swelter in the dark. Chaos reigns%21 
Here~’s another nightmare scenario: An electric grid that serves two-thirds of a billion people suddenly fails in a developing, nuclear-armed country with a rich history of ethnic and religious conflict. Rail transportation is shut down, cutting off travel to large swathes of the country, while many miners are trapped underground. 
Blackouts on this scale conjure images of civil unrest, overwhelmed police, crippled hospitals, darkened military bases, the gravely injured in the back of ambulances stuck in traffic jams. 
The specter of what Defense Secretary Leon Panetta has called a &amp;#34;digital Pearl Harbor
AND
Republicans to sound the alarm about the cyber threat in their party platforms. 
But are cyber attacks really a clear and present danger to society~’s critical life support systems, capable of inflicting thousands of casualties? Or has fear of full-blown cybergeddon at the hands of America~’s enemies become just another feverish national obsession — another of the long, dark shadows of the 9/11 attacks? 
Worries about a large-scale, devastating cyber attack on the United States date 
AND
espionage campaign against the United States by hackers linked to the Chinese army. 
Much of the concern has focused on potential attacks on the U.S. electrical grid. &amp;#34;If I were an attacker and I wanted to do strategic damage to the United States...I probably would sack electric power on the U.S. East Coast, maybe the West Coast, and attempt to cause a cascading effect,&amp;#34; retired Admiral Mike McConnell said in a 2010 interview with CBS~’s 60 Minutes. 
But the scenarios sketched out above are not solely the realm of fantasy. This summer, the United States and India were hit by two massive electrical outages — caused not by ninja cyber assault teams but by force majeure. And, for most people anyway, the results were less terrifying than imagined. 
First, the freak &amp;#34;derecho&amp;#34; storm that barreled across a heavily-populated swath of the eastern United States on the afternoon of June 29 knocked down trees that crushed cars, bashed holes in roofs, blocked roads, and sliced through power lines. 
According to an August report by the U.S. Department of Energy, 
AND
people as of July 5, all killed by storms or heat stroke. 
The second incident occurred in late July, when 670 million people in northern India
AND
the media there were no reports of deaths directly linked to the blackouts. 
But this cataclysmic event didn~’t cause widespread chaos in India — indeed, for some, it didn~’t even interrupt their daily routine. &amp;#34;~~M~~any people in major cities barely noticed the disruption because localized blackouts are so common that many businesses, hospitals, offices and middle-class homes have backup diesel generators,&amp;#34; the New York Timesreported. 
The most important thing about both events is what didn~’t happen. Planes didn~’t fall out of the sky. Governments didn~’t collapse. Thousands of people weren~’t killed. Despite disruption and delay, harried public officials, emergency workers, and beleaguered publics mostly muddled through. 
The summer~’s blackouts strongly suggest that a cyber weapon that took down an electric grid even for several days could turn out to be little more than a weapon of mass inconvenience.
That doesn~’t mean the United States can relax. James Lewis, director of the technology program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, believes that hackers threaten the security of U.S. utilities and industries, and recently penned an op-ed for the New York Times calling the United States &amp;#34;defenseless&amp;#34; to a cyber-assault. But he told Foreign Policy the recent derecho showed that even a large-scale blackout would not necessarily have catastrophic consequences.


===No cyber attacks/Hackers I/l===

====No cyber-attacks – lack of expertise, no resources, &amp;#34;air-gapping,&amp;#34; and no motivation====
Walsh 12 (Ryan, Office of Global Security at Goldman Sachs, &amp;#34;Cyberterrorism Trend Analysis,&amp;#34; 9/30, http://www.perspectivesonglobalissues.com/archives/fall-2010-conflict/cyberterrorism-trend-analysis/)

In light of all the warnings and statistics to date, it is critical to remember that there has not been an instance of a cyber terrorism attack on US public facilities, power grids, nuclear power plants, or transportation systems. Cyber attacks have occurred, but not the type that is being spoken of here—the kind that would qualify them as creating the type of damage a true cyber terrorist attack would create.

Today~’s announcement advances a five-year leasing plan first announced last November that also includes a dozen sales in the western, central and eastern Gulf, but excluded the entire Atlantic and Pacific seaboards — to industry and most Republican lawmakers~’ chagrin.
Interior officials said that East Coast states lack infrastructure to respond to potential oil spills and that West Coast states do not support offshore development. Federal agencies also lack adequate resource data to proceed with development in either ocean, the agency said.


**====Best DOD study agrees – specifically undermines CVN operations and training – any activity links even initial exploration====**

The report could be even more crippling. The Pentagon cannot unilaterally veto drilling proposals, but Dorothy Robyn, deputy under secretary of defense for installations and environment, said the Defense and Interior departments have a long history of cooperation, and drilling has never taken place in an area objected to by the military. &amp;#34;We have every expectation that if we said we need an area ... that they would fully honor that,&amp;#34; Robyn said.

3. When deciding whether to approve seismic testing or exploration and production off the 
AND
census of those special places and analyze possible impacts on them from drilling.
1. The Ocean: More Like A Diverse Forest Than A Desert
Many people look at the ocean and see it as a pretty, shiny surface
AND
spend most of their time at or near the surface of the ocean. 
All of these creatures are sensitive to the impacts of oil and pollution from oil and gas drilling; some are more sensitive than others. But none are immune to the short or long term effects of oil. 
With this as background, it is important to recognize the special places in the 
AND
: beaches, bays and marshes are often unusually sensitive to oil pollution.
2. Special Places in the Atlantic Ocean Deserving of Protection 
Based on the Environmental Sensitivity Index (ESI) and a crude measure of marine 
AND
primary productivity among all the planning areas with North Atlantic being ~~%2312.  
There are 14 submarine canyons between Massachusetts and Virginia that slice through the continental shelf 
AND
from spills and chronic pollution from production would be a very bad idea.
There are a number of important underwater plateaus and reefs off the eastern seaboard which 
AND
like these and jeopardizing productive commercial and recreational fisheries would make no sense.
Like on land, certain areas of the ocean support migration corridors for fish, 
AND
Kemp~’s ridley turtles all use this corridor at various times of the year.
Another corridor, farther offshore at the edge of the continental shelf break and slope provides food for various endangered sea turtles and other kinds of whales and dolphins. Whales and dolphins are typically migratory and each is only seasonally present but taken together the area is important year round to these marine mammals. 
There are four more hotspots of marine diversity and unusual productivity off the Mid Atlantic caused by ocean currents, type of bottom, ~~and~~ submarine canyons and other special characteristics.  These include: the coastal waters off North Carolina near and south of Cape Hatteras, the mouth of the Chesapeake and Delaware Bays and off New York harbor. Coastal waters and sandy bottoms off New Jersey support a large and economically important clam and scallop industry.  


====4 independent links - we don~’t need to win large spills or even that production occurs====
-	auditory disruption prevents multiple vital functions
-	blocks key migratory corridors and breeding habitat
-	even minor spills trigger
-	toxic water pollution

Out at Sea, But Not Out of¶ Harm~’s Way
The Atlantic canyons and seamounts remain largely¶ unscathed by humans. Because of their depth and¶ ruggedness, they have been out of reach to destructive¶ bottom trawling, a type of fishing using heavily weighted¶ nets to target bottom-dwelling fish, crushing, ripping, and¶ ultimately destroying fragile bottom habitats in the process.¶ So far the oil and gas industry has not been allowed to¶ commercially develop oil resources on the Eastern seaboard.

The Atlantic~’s Submarine Canyons¶ and Seamounts Need Our Protection
We have a unique opportunity now to protect the rich and¶ vulnerable resources of the Atlantic canyons and seamounts before irreversible harm is done. To date, only four of these¶ canyons have been protected from bottom trawling. None¶ of the canyons or seamounts are protected from oil and gas¶ exploration activities. We need to fully protect these special¶ places for the future before it is too late.

The Fifty States should:

-offer upfront cash grants to companies participating in the Next Generation Nuclear Plant program to fully offset the cost of robust detailed development design and engineering for a high-temperature gas-cooled Antares Prismatic reactor for the purpose of energy production and demonstration at the Idaho National Lab in the United States as well as the cost of acquiring relevant licensing and the cost of obtaining insurance, which agree to enter into a public-private partnership with the Department of Energy. Funds provided by the states should include a portion directed towards utilities and owner-operators to operate and build a demonstration reactor. Companies receiving funding should be required to share relevant designs with international collaborators in the Next Generation Nuclear Plant, in accordance with federal law.

-form constitutional commissions to uniformly amend their respective state constitutions to allow the state to run a limited deficit.  The National Governors Association should create a State Reserve Bank system. 

-fund Nuclear Regulatory Committee’s university programs for nuclear production.
