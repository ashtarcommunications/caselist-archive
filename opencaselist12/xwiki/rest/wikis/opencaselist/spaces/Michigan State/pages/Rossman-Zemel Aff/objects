Underview:
Contention Three is Politics
Framing Point – Plan is Negative State action – we lift “work-for-others” restrictions:

OTA ‘88

Second, Congressman Rohrabacher asserted ... time to achieve this milestone.

We’re not pro-State, but we’re “anti-anti State”. Some things can ONLY be solved “through the system” – and lifting existing State-exclusions on fusion are such an issue:
