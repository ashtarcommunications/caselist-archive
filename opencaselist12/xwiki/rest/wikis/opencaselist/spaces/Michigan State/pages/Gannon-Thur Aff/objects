&#xD;
QUESTION: Why should the U.S. maintain its funding of the fusion program and retain its leadership?&#xD;
ANSWER: The first reason is U.S. competitiveness, both the specific &#xD;
AND&#xD;
U.S. contributed. And time is important in this problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
====Energy leadership secures U.S. primacy and leverages great power rivals ====&#xD;

&#xD;
It is not only axiomatic but also true that federal science policy is largely played &#xD;
AND&#xD;
budgetary trends? The first thing to be said is that it depends on which trends one chooses to examine.&#xD;

An even more troubling feature of Adorno and Horkheimer’s analysis is the downplaying of individual

====&amp;#34;Should&amp;#34; is desirable, not mandatory====
**AC 99** (Atlas Collaboration, &amp;#34;Use of Shall, Should, May Can,&amp;#34; http://rd13doc.cern.ch/Atlas/DaqSoft/sde/inspect/shall.html)

~’shall~’ describes something that is mandatory. If a requirement uses ~’shall~’, then that 
AND
to be stated anywhere (to say nothing of defining what  ~’thoroughly~’ means).

====*Certainty~’s key to clarity and perception of stable government backing====
**Deutch 11** (John M., Institute Professor and Dean of Science – Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Ph.D. in Physical Chemistry – MIT, &amp;#34;An Energy Technology Corporation Will Improve the Federal Government~’s Efforts to Accelerate Energy Innovation&amp;#34;, Brookings Institution Hamilton Project Discussion Paper, May, http://www.brook ings.edu/~~/media/research/files/papers/2011/5/energy%20corporation%20deutch/05_energy_corporation_deutch_paper)

IDEAL CONDITIONS FOR SUCCESSFUL TECHNOLOGY DEMONSTRATION PROGRAMS

competitiveness are broader economic objectives that are not unique to the energy sector.

====Quick fusion solves environment deforestation and water pollution====
**Bednyagin 10** (Dr. Dennis, Ph.D. and Research Assistant – Laboratory of Energy Systems, &amp;#34;Socio-Economic Assessment of Fusion Energy Research, Development, Demonstration and Deployment Programme&amp;#34;, http://biblion.epfl.ch/EPFL/theses/2010/4732/EPFL_TH4732.pdf)

Recognising the importance of energy services for human well-being, it is expedient 
AND
even earlier if a more ambitious Fusion RandD programme is undertaken.

====CP causes info overload —- impact is mass delays and say &amp;#34;no&amp;#34;====
Rossi 97 (Jim, Assistant Professor and Dore Professor of State Administrative Law – Florida State University College of Law, &amp;#34;Participation Run Amok: The Costs of Mass Participation for Deliberative Agency Decisionmaking&amp;#34;, Northwestern University Law Review, Fall, 92 Nw. U.L. Rev. 173, Lexis)

Information overload for decisionmakers. -   To the extent that critical, rational dialogue does 
AND
, delay may have the effect of killing proposed projects or agency programs.

Guardian 12 (July 20^^th^^,   Richard Branson urges Obama to back next-generation nuclear technology  Billionaire pushes for the technology in a letter to White House that says integral fast reactors are clean, inexpensive and safe, http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/jul/20/richard-branson-obama-nuclear-technology)

Not everyone agrees that IFRs and other &amp;#34;fast&amp;#34; reactors are safe. Japan~’s

====Your tech isn~’t operational for decades====
**Smith, 11** (Gar, Editor Emeritus of Earth Island Journal, a former editor of Common Ground magazine, a Project Censored Award-winning journalist, and co-founder of Environmentalists Against War, June, edited by Ernest Callenbach, NUCLEAR ROULETTE: THE CASE AGAINST A NUCLEAR RENAISSANCE, International Forum on Globalization series focused on False Solutions, http://ifg.org/pdf/Nuclear_Roulette_book.pdf-http://ifg.org/pdf/Nuclear_Roulette_book.pdf, p. 42) 

Nuclear proponents frequently talk about the promise of a new generation of reactors that will

====Gen IV has the same problems as regular nuclear that block solvency====
**Caldicott, 6** (Helen, Founder and President of the Nuclear Policy Research Institute, Nuclear Power is not the answer, pg. 121)

Whereas the Generation III and III+ reactor designs represent evolutionary changes from their Generation

It~’s all starting to come together.&amp;#34;

====Fusion spending~’s key to U.S. manufacturing====
**Mason 9** (Thom, Director – Oak Ridge National Laboratory, &amp;#34;The Next Generation of Fusion Energy Research&amp;#34;, Congressional Documents and Publications, 10-29, Lexis)

The international ITER project represents an opportunity for the Department of Energy~’s national laboratories, 
AND
benefits to society and the scientific and technical challenges are no less significant.

====Key to heg, econ, and dollar strength====
**Thompson 9** (Loren B., Ph.D. and Chief Operating Officer – Lexington Institute, &amp;#34;Reversing Industrial Decline: A Role for the Defense Budget&amp;#34;, 8-19, http://www.lexingtoninstitute.org/reversing-industrial-decline-a-role-for-the-defense-budget)

But that~’s not the worst-case scenario. This is: Congress may not 
AND
and make it harder to come up with compromises by New Year~’s Eve.

====Either no compromise or limited compromise- makes the impact inevitable====
**Krasting 10-1**
Bruce Krasting is a former hedge fund manager¶ I~’ve been writing for the professional press for the last five years and have been on the Fox Business channel several times as a guest describing my written work.¶ 10-1-2012 http://www.businessinsider.com/war-headlines-after-the-november-election-will-prevent-cutbacks-in-military-spending-2012-10-http://www.businessinsider.com/war-headlines-after-the-november-election-will-prevent-cutbacks-in-military-spending-2012-10

-I think there is zero probability that all of the issues now on the 
AND
lost. A long period of economic mediocrity is the most likely outcome.

====They can~’t produce a card Obama is pushing- their 1NC card is a NOT PUSHING CARD====
**Fox News, 9-12**

THUNE: Well, look, I think that there~’s — you know, this 
AND
pounding the heads in the Senate and pounding the heads in the House?

====Compromise won~’t include PTC and that thumps the impact====
**NYT, 10-1**
2012 http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/01/business/economy/payroll-tax-cut-unlikely-to-survive-into-next-year.html?_r=1%26hp-http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/01/business/economy/payroll-tax-cut-unlikely-to-survive-into-next-year.html?_r=1%26hp

Regardless of who wins the presidential election in November or what compromises Congress strikes in 
AND
will expire and the military and other domestic spending programs will be reduced. 

====Spending now – veterans bill====
**Madison 9/10** (Lucy, political reporter for CBS News, &amp;#34;Congress back to work, but little action expected,&amp;#34; http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-57509835-503544/congress-back-to-work-but-little-action-expected/)

The Senate is also slated to vote this week on a Veterans Jobs Corps 
AND
decent chance it would earn bipartisan support.

====And CR====
**Madison 9/10** (Lucy, political reporter for CBS News, &amp;#34;Congress back to work, but little action expected,&amp;#34; http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-57509835-503544/congress-back-to-work-but-little-action-expected/-http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-57509835-503544/congress-back-to-work-but-little-action-expected/)

On Thursday, the House is expected to take up a stopgap spending measure to 
AND
clean bill could pass through the two chambers within a couple of days. 

====Winners win====
**Halloran 10** (Liz, Reporter – NPR, &amp;#34;For Obama, What A Difference A Week Made&amp;#34;, National Public Radio, 4-6, http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=125594396)

Amazing what a win in a major legislative battle will do for a president~’s spirit
AND
can reverse what the polls now suggest is a losing issue for them. 

====Capital isn~’t key====
**Dickinson 9** (Matthew, Professor of Political Science – Middlebury College and Former Professor – Harvard University, &amp;#34;Sotomayor, Obama, and Presidential Power&amp;#34;, Presidential Power: A NonPartisan Analysis of Presidential Politics, 5-26, http://blogs.middlebury.edu/presidentialpower/2009/05/26/sotamayor-obama-and-presidential-power/

As for Sotomayor, from here the path toward almost certain confirmation goes as follows
AND
has already occurred, in the decision to present Sotomayor as his nominee.

====Kerry supports the plan —- 1AC evidence —- key to the agenda====
**Leibovich 9** (Mark, Reporter – NYT, &amp;#34;After a Humbling Spiral, Kerry Returns to Form&amp;#34;, New York Times, 11-24, http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/25/us/politics/25kerry.html?_r=1%26ref=johnkerry)

Mr. Kerry~’s long, lined face will always suggest

DEBATE about America~’s energy supply is heating up 
AND
that will shape our future. Scientists and engineers stand ready to help.

====Federal funding is the focal point====
**Sarewitz 3** (Daniel, Professor of Science and Society and Co-Director of the Consortium for Science, Policy and Outcomes – Arizona State University, &amp;#34;Does Science Policy Exist, and If So, Does it Matter?: Some Observations on the U.S. R%26D Budget&amp;#34;, Discussion Paper for Earth Institute Science, Technology, and Global Development Seminar, 4-8, http://www.cspo.org/documents/budget_seminar.pdf)

It is not only axiomatic but also true that federal science policy is largely played 
AND
The first thing to be said is that it depends on which trends one chooses to examine.

====Overcomes alt causes====
**Woodruff 11** (Woodruff Scientific Ltd, C-Corp established in 2005 in Seattle, Washington.

The need for fusion could not be more pronounced than today: the world is 
AND
The time is now for fusion.

====Extinction====

deep foreign policy paradigm that frames the complexity of the challenges that face America and the world.

===Contention 2 —- STEM===

====Scientists watch federal fusion funding —- cuts turn away grad students====
**Derose 12** (Kimberly, Miliken Scholar, MS in Journalism – USC, AB Physics – Harvard University, and Science Writer –  UCLA Office of Media Relations, &amp;#34;Dire Prospects for Domestic Fusion Energy Research&amp;#34;, Spring 2012 Money, Markets and Media – USC Annenberg School of Communication, 3-3, http://ascjweb.org/moneymarkets-http://ascjweb.org/moneymarkets media/?p=433)

It is certainly not uncommon for government experiments to have their funding pulled.  Yet 
AND

====This breaks the STEM pipeline ====
**Olynyck 12** (Geoff, Ph.D. Candidate in Plasma Science and Fusion – Massachusetts Institute of Technology, et al., &amp;#34;Don~’t Break the Pipeline: Ensuring a Workforce for the Burning Plasma Era&amp;#34;, 7-27, http://fire.pppl.gov/FESAC_WP_workforce_MIT.pdf)

The proposed FY2013 budget does not set FES 
AND
fusion reactors will requires attracting and retaining the world~’s best scientists and engineers.

====The entire nuclear program will become ineffective====
**Sutherland 12** (Derek, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, &amp;#34;Continue Funding C-Mod&amp;#34;, The Tech – Online Edition, 3-23, http://tech.mit.edu/V132/N14/editorial.html)

The Alcator C-Mod fusion reactor is one of the largest experiments at MIT
AND
well that it can trust MIT to put it~’s money to good use.

====Plan steers them back====
**Ludes 11** (Dr. Jim, Executive Director – American Security Project, &amp;#34;Fusion Energy: An Opportunity for American Leadership and Security&amp;#34;, American Security Project White Paper, 1-24, https://life.llnl.gov/life_in_the_media/pdfs/fusion_2020_paper.pdf-https://life.llnl.gov/life_in_the_media/pdfs/fusion_2020_paper.pdf)

With the political will and the right investment,
AND

Sovacool and Brown, p. 304-305)

We also examined the thesis that these large programs &amp;#34;crowd out&amp;#34; other research 
AND
across technologies, sectors, and the multiple stages of the innovation process.

====Fed~’s key====
**Holdren 10** (John P., Former Director and Faculty Chair in the Science, Technology and Public Policy Program – Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, Harvard University, &amp;#34;Prepare and Inspire: K-12 Education in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) for America~’s Future&amp;#34;, September, http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/pcast-stemed-report.pdf)

The situation in the world today is extremely complex as it relates to nuclear technology  
AND
desalination to recovery of usable petroleum products from oil shale and tar sands.

====Decline cracks the backbone of deterrence====
**Townsend 9** (Frances Fragos, Former Assistant to President Bush for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism and Senior Member of the Department of Justice, et al., &amp;#34;Leveraging Science for Security: A Strategy for the Nuclear Weapons Laboratories in the 21st Century&amp;#34;, Task Force on Leveraging the Scientific and Technological Capabilities of the NNSA National Laboratories for 21st Century National Security, March, http://www.stimson.org/images/uploads/research-pdfs/Leveraging_Science_for_Security_FINAL.pdf)

The United States is quickly losing its leadership 
AND
, the work to achieve this vision should not undercut US nonproliferation goals.

====It~’s failing and risks great power conflict====
**Spring 12** (Baker, F. M. Kirby Research Fellow in National Security Policy – Heritage Foundation, and Michaela Bendikova, Research Assistant for Missile Defense and Foreign Policy in the Douglas and Sarah Allison Center for Foreign Policy Studies – Heritage Foundation, &amp;#34;Time to Modernize and Revitalize the Nuclear Triad&amp;#34;, Heritage Backgrounder, 1-27, http://thf_media.s3.amazonaws.com/2012/pdf/bg2646.pdf)

Abstract: The U.S. nuclear triad of heavy bombers, intercontinental-

awesome capability, it is that it demands constant and undivided attention.5

====Global nuclear war====
**Caves 10** (John P. Jr., Senior Fellow – Center for the Study of Weapons of Mass Destruction, &amp;#34;Avoiding a Crisis of Confidence in the U.S. Nuclear Deterrent&amp;#34;, Strategic Forum, 252, January, http://www.ndu.edu/inss/docuploaded/SF%20252_John%20Caves.pdf)

Perceptions of a compromised U.S. nuclear deterrent 
AND 
catastrophic than what nuclear-armed terrorists alone could inflict.

====Nuclear science stops testing —- monitors arms control and maintains the SSP====
**Henning 10** (Walter, Senior Physicist – Argonne National Laboratory and Member – American Association for the Advancement of Science, &amp;#34;Accelerators for America~’s Future&amp;#34;, June, http://www.acceleratorsamerica.org/files/Rep-http://www.acceleratorsamerica.org/files/Rep ort.pdf)

From the earliest days of their development, accelerators have made critical contributions to the 
AND
eliminate the need for highly enriched uranium and nuclear reactor facilities for production.

====SSP failure forces testing====
**Smith 98** (Harold P., Former Assistant to the Secretary of Defense and Richard S. Soll, Senior Scientist and Head of Special Projects – Science Applications International Corporation, &amp;#34;Challenges of Nuclear Stockpile Stewardship Under A Comprehensive Test Ban&amp;#34;, Arms Control Today, March, http://www.armscontrol.org/print/304)

In the absence of underground nuclear test explosions and with no new U.S
AND
Department of Defense would play a critical role in such a momentous step.

====Global nuclear war ====
Johnson 1 (Rebecca, Executive Director – Acronym Institute for Disarmament Diplomacy, The Guardian, 7-17, Lexis)

Then the international arms control and non- proliferation regimes collapsed. Americans weren~’t bothered 
AND
and grumbling won~’t keep us safe. It is time to speak out.

===Contention 3 —- Fusion===

====Funding’s key to fusion commercialization —- it~’s feasible and delivers huge energy====
**Burnett 12** (Burke, Executive Secretary – Pacific Science Association, Executive Director – Indo-Pacific Conservation Alliance, and MA in International Relations – Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, &amp;#34;CBS News Segment On Potentially Game-Changing Fusion Research&amp;#34;, EnterSpace, 4-1, http://enterspace.typepad.com/blog/2012/04/fusion-research-at-nif.html-http://enterspace.typepad.com/blog/2012/04/fusion-research-at-nif.html)

In terms of physics, there is no barrier to fusion as a successful source
AND
the board, which would render these zero-sum budget games moot.

====Scientific capability exists. Money is the outstanding variable. ====
**Prager 9** (Dr. Stewart C., Director – Princeton University Plasma Physics Laboratory, &amp;#34;The Next Generation of Fusion Energy Research&amp;#34;, Hearing before the House Subcommittee on Energy and Environment, 10-29, http://fire.pppl.gov/house_fusion_hearing_2010.pdf)

Second, Congressman Rohrabacher asserted that there has been little progress in fusion energy. 
AND
. The scientific knowledge has existed for some time to achieve this milestone.

====Isotopes are abundant and there~’s no downside====
**Carr 12** – Jacob, University of Pittsburgh and Research Engineer – National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, and Ty Gumbert, Engineering – University of Pittsburgh, &amp;#34;Nuclear Fusion Technologies and Their Applications as a Global Power Source&amp;#34;, 136.142.82.187/eng12/Chair/data/papers/2186/2186.docx

 The upsides of fusion outweigh the downsides by a landslide. One of the 
AND
be built makes them very desirable and advantageous as an applicable power source.

====Engineering barriers will be overcome====
**Stacey 99** (Weston M., Callawy Regents Professor of Nuclear Engineering – Georgia Tech, Ph.D. in Nuclear Engineering – MIT, Multiple Award Winner, Including American Nuclear Society Seaborg Medal for Nuclear Research, Wigner Reactor Physicist Award, and Outstanding Achievement in Fusion Award, &amp;#34;Commentaries on Criticisms of Magnetic Fusion&amp;#34;, March, http://fire.pppl.gov/fusion_critic_response_stacey.pdf)

Dr. Parkins~’ central theme is that &amp;#34;fusion reactors...hopeless because of engineering 
AND
tokamak reactors, relative to projections based on ~’conventional~’ tokamak plasma performance.

====Fed~’s key====
**Miller 7** (Warren, Research Professor and Associate Director of the Nuclear Security Science and Policy Institute – Texas A%26M University, &amp;#34;Nuclear~’s Human Element&amp;#34;, A Report By the American Nuclear Society Special Committee on Federal Investment in Nuclear Education, February, http://www.ans.org/pi/fine/docs/finereport.pdf)

The United States must have appropriate numbers of high-quality NSE graduates for the 
AND
Such efforts will likely be required for an indefinite period in the future.

====Fusion tech will be adopted by the Navy —- key to global, rapid power projection====
**Triola 8** (Larry C., Naval Surface Warfare Center, &amp;#34;Energy %26 National Security: An Exploration of
Threats, Solutions, and Alternative Futures&amp;#34;, 10-9, http://www.theeestory.com/files/may6LTriola.pdf-http://www.theeestory.com/files/may6LTriola.pdf)

Current nuclear power technology offers potential to replace all electrical-grid power production without

A fusion reactor called Iter is currently under construction in France and is due to start operation in 2020. Its principal goal is to determine the viability of fusion at the scale of a power station. Success is widely anticipated and there are already plans afoot to build a &amp;#34;demonstration power plant&amp;#34; to start operating in the 2030s.&#xD;
Fusion is the reason that our sun keeps shining. Deep in the sun~’s core &#xD;

The goal is to exploit the same basic physics to generate energy here on Earth&#xD;

: it takes a proton in the sun around 5bn years to fuse.&#xD;
For that reason Iter will not fuse protons; instead it will fuse deuterium and &#xD;

The fuel is not too hard to come by either, and it won~’t run out in the next few million years at least: deuterium is plentiful in seawater and tritium can be manufactured by reacting those outgoing neutrons with lithium.&#xD;

DEBATE about America~’s energy supply is heating up
AND
that will shape our future. Scientists and engineers stand ready to help.

====Federal funding is the focal point====

It is not only axiomatic but also true that federal science policy is largely played 
AND
The first thing to be said is that it depends on which trends one chooses to examine.

====Overcomes alt causes====

The world we face in 2012 is of a different character than even a few years ago. 
AND
policy paradigm that frames the complexity of the challenges that face America and the world.

===Contention 2 —- STEM Education===

====Scientists watch federal funding streams. Low fusion spending turns away STEM grad students.====
**Derose 12** (Kimberly, Miliken Scholar, MS in Journalism – USC, AB Physics – Harvard University, and Science Writer –  UCLA Office of Media Relations, &amp;#34;Dire Prospects for Domestic Fusion Energy Research&amp;#34;, Spring 2012 Money, Markets and Media – USC Annenberg School of Communication, 3-3, http://ascjweb.org/moneymarkets-http://ascjweb.org/moneymarkets media/?p=433)

With the political will and the right investment, the potential strategic gains for the U.S. in the aggressive development and deployment of fusion power plants are extraordinary. These would include:
• Clean, safe, sustainable, and affordable electricity generation in the U.S. and the world;
• Energy independence and associated freedom from foreign countries for our energy supplies;
• Transition to an electricity-generating economy to power our cars and trucks;
• Elimination of the actinides in spent nuclear-fuel by building fusion/fission hybrid plants (using the high neutron fields from fusion to transmute the actinides in spent fuel and thereby render the spent fuel non-toxic within 200 years – not tens of thousands of years);
• The two-fold boost to the U.S. economy of reducing our huge trade imbalance by eliminating the cost of importing oil and making the U.S. a world-leader in the energy market by providing fusion generating plants for the whole world;
• Creation of a large number of jobs in building and maintaining commercialized fusion power plants;
• Demonstration of how U.S. leadership in technology can be leveraged to drive leadership in energy; and
• Increase interest and high-paying jobs for young people going into scientific and engineering fields.

Quebec voters may worry that their province will suffer economically if it separates.

====Global separatism.====

Secession would be economically bad for Quebec, but it would also be morally wrong 
AND
fortune as Canada cannot successfully bring together populations with different languages and backgrounds.

====Extinction====

This paper has argued that self-determination conflicts have direct adverse consequences on international 
AND
a real danger that regional conflicts will erupt over national minorities and borders. 

===STEM Education – 1AC===

====Scientists watch federal funding streams. Low fusion spending turns away STEM grad students.====
**Derose 12** (Kimberly, Miliken Scholar, MS in Journalism – USC, AB Physics – Harvard University, and Science Writer –  UCLA Office of Media Relations, &amp;#34;Dire Prospects for Domestic Fusion Energy Research&amp;#34;, Spring 2012 Money, Markets and Media – USC Annenberg School of Communication, 3-3, http://ascjweb.org/moneymarkets-http://ascjweb.org/moneymarkets media/?p=433)

It is certainly not uncommon for government experiments to have their funding pulled.  Yet  
AND
is perhaps the greatest problem with path we~’re on,&amp;#34; Greenwald told Science.

====This breaks the pipeline of STEM workers====
**Olynyk 12** (Geoff, Ph.D. Candidate in Plasma Science and Fusion – Massachusetts Institute of Technology, et al., &amp;#34;Don~’t Break the Pipeline: Ensuring a Workforce for the Burning Plasma Era&amp;#34;, 7-27, http://fire.pppl.gov/FESAC_WP_workforce_MIT.pdf)

Recommendations
The proposed FY2013 budget does not set FES on a path to create a workforce commensurate with the goals 
AND
fusion reactors will requires attracting and retaining the world~’s best scientists and engineers.

====Multiple fields will be affected. Fusion investment steers students back.====
**Ludes 11** (Dr. Jim, Executive Director – American Security Project, &amp;#34;Fusion Energy: An Opportunity for American Leadership and Security&amp;#34;, American Security Project White Paper, 1-24, https://life.llnl.gov/life_in_the_media/pdfs/fusion_2020_paper.pdf-https://life.llnl.gov/life_in_the_media/pdfs/fusion_2020_paper.pdf)

With the political will and the right investment, the potential strategic gains for the U.S. in the aggressive

• Increase interest and high-paying jobs for young people going into scientific and engineering fields.

====Funding sends a signal of commitment that increases enrollment in nuclear science —- demand-side drivers are key====

One way to expand the supply of STEM students is to expand demand for them
AND
right numbers, with the right skills, and at the right times.

====Federal signal~’s key====
**Holdren 10** (John P., Former Director and Faculty Chair in the Science, Technology and Public Policy Program – Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, Harvard University, &amp;#34;Prepare and Inspire: K-12 Education in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) for America~’s Future&amp;#34;, September, http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/pcast-stemed-report.pdf)

PCAST believes that technology has now advanced to the point that it can and should play a leading role in 
AND
for education. State and local educational authorities lack the necessary resources or scale.

====Workforce shortages undermine nuclear archeology====
**Bender 10** – Bryan, National Security Correspondent – Boston Globe and Former Washington Bureau Chief – Jane~’s Defense Weekly, &amp;#34;Alarm Over Shortage Of Nuclear Experts&amp;#34;, 4-3, http://www-ners.engin.umich.edu/news_archive/20100625140822mlr

The United States is facing a critical shortage of nuclear scientists and engineers, even 
AND
Iran or North Korea live up to their commitments in arms control agreements.

====Archeology~’s key to effective arms control —- spurs multilateral agreement and solves breakout====
**Davis 10** – Dr. Jay Davis, National Security Fellow – Center for Global Security Research, Founding Director – Defense Threat Reduction Agency of the United States Department of Defense, and Chair – American Physical Society Panel on Public Affairs, et al., &amp;#34;Technical Steps to Support Nuclear Arsenal Downsizing&amp;#34;, February, http://www.aps.org/policy/reports/popa-reports/upload/nucleardownsizing.PDF

Disclosure of Stockpiles
An essential component of robust future nuclear arms reduction agreements will be the declaration of 
AND
operation of nuclear facilities and therefore identify amounts of plutonium and uranium production.

====Extinction====
Müller 00 (Harold, Director of the Peace Research Institute-Frankfurt and Professor of International Relations at Goethe University, &amp;#34;Compliance Politics: A Critical Analysis of Multilateral Arms Control Treaty Enforcement&amp;#34;, Nonproliferation Review, 7(2), Summer)

In this author~’s view,3 at least four distinct missions continue to make arms

level of conflict and assist in ushering in new relations of global cooperation.

====Breakout causes rearm races and nuclear war====
**Glaser 98** – Charles L., Professor of Political Science and International Affairs – George Washington University, &amp;#34;The Flawed Case for Nuclear Disarmament&amp;#34;, Survival, Spring, 40(1), p. 114-116

Because nuclear arsenals could be rebuilt, much of the effort in establishing a disarmament 
AND
irrationally - but this seems just as likely in the formerly disarmed world.

====Multilateral arms control stops US/China arms competition====
**Dunn 9** (Lewis A., Senior Vice President – Science Applications International Corp and Former U.S. Ambassador to the NPT, &amp;#34;Reshaping Strategic Relationships: Expanding the Arms Control Toolbox&amp;#34;, Arms Control Today, May, http://www.armscontrol.org/act/2009_5/Dunn)

Multilateral efforts, such as working to achieve the entry into force of the Comprehensive 
AND
U.S. officials and their counterparts in other countries should take advantage of the full spectrum of these activities.

====Escalates —- transparency solves====

New Challenges in Sino-U.S. Crisis Stability 
In the United States, we tend to think about two implications that will arise 
AND
a dialogue can reduce the possibility of accidents, miscalculations, or misunderstandings. 

====Global nuclear war====
Hunkovic 9 (Lee J, American Military University, &amp;#34;The Chinese-Taiwanese Conflict: Possible Futures of a Confrontation between China, Taiwan and the United States of America&amp;#34;, http://www.lamp-method.org/eCommons/ Hunkovic.pdf-http://www.lamp-method.org/eCommons/Hunkovic.pdf)

A war between China, Taiwan and the United States has the potential to escalate 
AND
outcome, therefore, other countries will not be considered in this study.

===Answers===

====Plan~’s applied R%26D, solves limits====

Federal energy-related R%26D can be described as falling into three classes: basic research, research that seeks

this program is %2419 million, out of the %2430 million for new or improved nuclear power plants.

====Fusion generation is applied R%26D====
**CFR 12** – Code of Federal Regulations, Department of Energy: Title 10 – Energy, PT. 500-End, p. 249-250

Geoff forwarded me your email regarding the issues with federally funded fusion research. I agree with everything he said, and I wanted to add

Constitution so it~’s important that fusion is under federal jurisdiction at the moment)

====Duplication and lack of coordination undermine solvency. And they can~’t fund PPPL.====
**Olynyk 12** – Geoff, Ph.D. Candidate in Plasma Physics and Fusion Energy – MIT, B.Sc (Eng), Engineering Physics – Queen~’s University, Summer NSERC USRA Internship – Royal Military College of Canada, Email Exchange with Casey Harrigan, 10-22, http://msudebate.blogspot.com/2012/10/exchange-with-olynyk.html-http://msudebate.blogspot.com/2012/10/exchange-with-olynyk.html

Now, the other part of the question is - why the U.S. federal government in particular, and not state 
AND
it nationally allows it to be coordinated nationally, reducing duplication of effort.

====Fusion is a direct challenge to the military-industrial complex —- conflating nuclear energy with weapons plays into the hands of elites====
**Razani 12** (Rezwan, Executive Director – Focus Fusion Society, &amp;#34;Batman Fusion Redemption&amp;#34;, Fusion Energy League, 7-26, http://www.fusionenergyleague.org/index.php/blog/article/batman_fusion_redemption-http://www.fusionenergyleague.org/index.php/blog/article/batman_fusion_redemption)

Fusion doesn~’t melt down. TDKR confuses fission and fusion. Fission (FIZZ) 
AND
energy with nuclear weapons means:¶ Nuclear Energy Loses.¶ Nuclear Weapons WIN.¶

THE SECOND PART of the answer- to which I now turn—is a

-level and at the macro-level, involving large social forces.  


====Our argument is not that China is a threat – it~’s that we should avoid either simplistic, reifying extreme. The 1AC instead points to context. ====

The argument of this essay is not that China is a threat. Rather, 
AND
threat and opportunity are intimately related as complementary opposites that entail each other.

Nuclear Fusion&#xD;
Nuclear fusion occurs when multiple small nuclei are forced to fuse together.  Since the mass of the combined nuclei will be less than the mass of the individual nuclei added together, energy will be released.  When the combined mass is less than the mass of iron, the particles will be more tightly bound than when they were in the smaller nuclei 2.  This is once again based on the Einstein equation (Equation 1) shown previously. &#xD;

&#xD;
The first achievement of fusion at Sandia National Laboratory&amp;#39;s Z facility in New Mexico was announced at the APS April meeting in Philadelphia.&#xD;
The Z machine created a hot dense plasma that produces neutrons associated with nuclear fusion. Compressing hot dense plasmas that produce neutrons is an important step towards realizing ignition, the level at which the fusion reaction becomes self-sustaining.&#xD;
According to Sandia&amp;#39;s Ray Leeper, the neutrons emanate from fusion reactions within a BB-sized deuterium capsule placed within the central target in the Z facility, itself about a third of a football field in diameter. While tokamaks cause fusion reactions to occur by confining plasmas in large magnetic fields, and laser facilities focus intense beams on or around a target, Z applies a huge pulse of electricity (about 12 million joules) with very sophisticated timing.&#xD;
The pulse creates an intense magnetic field which crushes an array of tungsten wires into &#xD;
AND&#xD;
the Z machine, itself a circular device about 120 feet in diameter.&#xD;
Sandia researchers measured a yield of approximately 10 billion neutrons, around the expected energy &#xD;
AND&#xD;
area to create fusion. Now it seems clear we can do that.&amp;#34;&#xD;
Providing outside commentary, Cornell University&amp;#39;s David Hammer said that the Sandia group performed a &#xD;
AND&#xD;
volume. Those quantities were independently confirmed by X-ray spectroscopy measurements.&#xD;
While deuterium-filled capsules driven by lasers have long ago produced neutrons, this experiment represents the first time that the straightforward, relatively inexpensive and potentially robust technology of pulsed power has been able to achieve the conditions of high temperature and density needed to produce measurable thermonuclear neutrons.&#xD;

Nuclear fusion energy is produced by combining light atoms (deuturium or tritium - heavy isotopes of hydrogen) in a fusion reactor. Unfortunately, this form of energy is still in the research and development stage and is at least 50 years away from becoming a practical energy source. Its advantage lies in the vast amounts of hydrogen that lie in the Earth&amp;#39;s oceans, which can supply anticipated global energy needs for centuries to come.&#xD;

Power lingo in the electric industry&#xD;
Rather than the standard units of Joules, electric companies bill by the kilowatt-hour, as you can see by looking at your most recent utility bill. This is just another measure of energy, akin to the Joule. 1 kW-hr is the amount of energy used if it is pulled at 1000 Watts for 1 hour. If you convert hours to seconds, you’ll find that this is equivalent to 3.6 million Joules.&#xD;
