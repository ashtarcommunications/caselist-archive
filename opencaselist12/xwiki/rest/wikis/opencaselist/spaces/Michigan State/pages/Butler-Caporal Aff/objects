Batman (TDKR) Fusion Flubs
First, let’s foil the bomb plot with a review of fusion science.  The
AND
shot and hope for the worst.  Fusion is not useful for terrorists.
 


Nuclear waste and accidents cause extinction —- fusion solves
Wilson 12 (Taylor, Genius, Thiel Fellowship Winner and Youngest Person Ever to Build a Fusion Reactor, &amp;#34;Why We Need Nuclear Energy&amp;#34;, CNN, 6-8, http://whatsnext.blogs.cnn.com/2012/06/08/taylor-wilson-why-we-need-nuclear-energy/)
One of these technologies, nuclear fusion, is perhaps the disruptive technology that we 
AND
will have the energy source we need to survive long into the future.
Proliferation fast – nuclear energy programs
Darrell Blakeway is Executive Director, Perennial Energy Consulting, Inc., formerly an attorney for 25 years at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, &amp;#34;BOOK REVIEW: ENERGY AUTONOMY: GETTING SERIOUS ABOUT RENEWABLE ENERGY,&amp;#34; 2008, Energy Law Review, lexis

Proliferation undermines crisis stability

Crisis stability could be undermined as existing nuclear arsenals become less robust and as nuclear 
AND
situation. these technical assessments, by definition, would produce crisis instability.
Global fission makes prolif inevitable —- fusion comparatively decreases the risk
Greenwald 12 (Martin, Senior Research Scientist – MIT, &amp;#34;Fusion Energy&amp;#34;, Huffington Post Blog, 5-30,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/martin-greenwald/fusion-energy_b_1557556.html)
Perhaps the most frightening aspect of a global fission industry is the risk of nuclear 
AND
, to property or water supplies, nor would it threaten social trauma.
No risk of clandestine operation
Glaser 12 (A., Professor of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering – Princeton University and R.J. Goldston, Professor of Plasma Physics – Princeton University, &amp;#34;Proliferation Risks of Magnetic Fusion Energy: Clandestine Production, Covert Production and Breakout&amp;#34;, Nuclear Fusion, 52(4), March, IOP Science)
2. Clandestine production of weapons material¶ There is no credible risk that a 
AND
overall not credible that such a facility could be constructed and operated clandestinely.
Fusion solves nuclear breakout —- risk is comparatively higher from fission
Glaser 12 (A., Professor of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering – Princeton University and R.J. Goldston, Professor of Plasma Physics – Princeton University, &amp;#34;Proliferation Risks of Magnetic Fusion Energy: Clandestine Production, Covert Production and Breakout&amp;#34;, Nuclear Fusion, 52(4), March, IOP Science)
Fusion power plants require many supporting facilities that are non-nuclear in nature, 
AND
to weapons materials: clandestine production, covert diversion and breakout from safeguards.

Easterbrook ’02 ~[Gregg, Visiting Fellow of aspx at the Brookings Institution, New Republic, October 7, 2002~]
Note that bioweapons have done steadily less harm in recent times, as public health

Von Hippel 1 (Frank, Co-Chair – International Panel on Fissile Materials, 21st Century Weapons Proliferation: Are We Ready?, Ed. Sokolski, p. 84)
No nuclear weapon can be made without kilogram quantities of fissile material such as highly

of materials made excess by nuclear disarmament or changes in nuclear energy policy.
Fusion weapons blur the firebreak —- risks catastrophic prolif and nuclear use
Zerriffi 99 (Hisham, Project Scientist – Institute for Energy and Environmental Research, and Arjun Makhijani, &amp;#34;Pure Fusion Weapons?&amp;#34;, Peace Magazine, January / February, http://peacemagazine.org/archive/v15n1p24.htm)
Nuclear weapons changed in 1953, when nuclear fission (the splitting of atoms) 
AND
implications of this military arithmetic for nuclear nonproliferation and disarmament would be profound.
Extinction – none of their ev assumes
Schwartz and Derber 90 (William and Charles, Member – Boston Nuclear Study Group and Prof of Sociology – Boston College, The Nuclear Seduction, p. 35)
Before examining whether the arms race really matters much to nuclear credibility, we must

PRICE ‘98
(RICHARD PRICE is a former prof in the Department of Anthropology at Yale University. Later, he moved to Johns Hopkins University to found the Department of Anthropology, where he served three terms as chair. A decade of freelance teaching (University of Minnesota, Stanford University, Princeton University, University of Florida, Universidade Federal da Bahia), ensued.

One of the central departures of critical international theory from positivism is the view that 
AND
violates the interpretive ethos of critical international theory than does critical theory itself.

Contextualization is central to all three of these approaches. In the first case,

The understanding of nuclear processes in the core of a nuclear reactor is generally not a subject within the purview of the federal government~~’s basic research funding agencies (e.g., NSF). This is due in large part to (%%)DOE~~’s clear charter(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:7.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri&amp;#34; %), dating from the Atomic Energy Act, (%%)as the principal steward of the U.S. nuclear education enterprise(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri&amp;#34; %).

These research activities, all related to the practical applications of nuclear energy, may be funded by the NSF, the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD), the DOE/SC, and other agencies.

Because NSE is so complex and applicable in so many fields, today~~’s undergraduate nuclear engineering program must cover a broad range of technical material. It is only in graduate school that an NSE student can focus on a particular application, e.g., design of new nuclear power plants, development of instruments to detect nuclear materials in shipping containers, new techniques for radiation treatment of cancer, etc. Many of the NSE positions in government agencies, national laboratories, universities, and medical facilities can be filled only by people holding graduate degrees. A graduate degree in NSE requires both study of advanced theory and research that involves practical application of theory in the student~~’s area of specialization.

This role includes monitoring (a) the relationship between demand and supply of NSE graduates; (b) the NSE education infrastructure, including faculty, facilities, and equipment; and (c) the level and quality of research in NSE university programs. The DOE must provide financial support to sustain faculty, students, and infrastructure to the extent needed to assure a healthy NSE enterprise in the country.(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:6.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri&amp;#34; %)¶ (% style=&amp;#34;font-size:4.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri&amp;#34; %)On the other hand, the DOE NSE education support programs cannot, alone, provide the resources needed for a healthy and comprehensive national effort.

In the R%26D realm, there are challenges in energy security, nuclear security, and other fields. In the area of nuclear energy, there are new, DOE-funded initiatives in advanced reactors, in nuclear energy for hydrogen production, and in spent-fuel management. Advanced reactor programs include novel ideas in water-cooled, gas-cooled, and liquid-metal-cooled reactors. Research programs are directed toward fielding Generation IV reactors in the first half of the 21st century. (% style=&amp;#34;font-size:7.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri&amp;#34; %)In addition, (%%)there continue to be R%26D efforts to demonstrate(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:7.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri&amp;#34; %) the tokamak and other plasma confinement (%%)concepts that could lead to a demonstration fusion reactor(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:7.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri&amp;#34; %) in the middle of the century(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri&amp;#34; %). Nuclear energy can potentially be used to produce hydrogen for transportation applications in an economically feasible manner and there is a vigorous research program to develop high-temperature reactors for this purpose. A newly announced DOE program, the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP), is intended to develop the systems, technologies, and policy regimes to allow recycling of used light water reactor fuel and, to a large extent, eliminate the actinides in fast-spectrum reactors in a way that enhances proliferation resistance. The resulting waste streams are envisioned to have characteristics that would lessen the demand for geologic repository assets. These and other DOE-funded research efforts will need to make great use of university-based NSE capabilities.(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:6.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri&amp;#34; %)¶ (% style=&amp;#34;font-size:4.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri&amp;#34; %)In the nuclear security arena, unclassified research needs are also varied and rich. In addition to assuring the safety, reliability, and security of the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile, innovations are needed to detect and defend against the proliferation of weapons-usable nuclear materials. From systems analysis to new nuclear detector innovations and new approaches to analyze intelligence data, research opportunities abound. Defense against nuclear terrorism requires new approaches to border security and new methodologies to attribute nuclear and radiological contamination to a particular country or source. Federal agencies are specifically targeting universities for innovations in these fields. New attention is also being given to other applications of nuclear processes, especially to provide process heat. Potential applications vary from water desalination to recovery of usable petroleum products from oil shale and tar sands. These needs will challenge university-based NSE programs to respond. One might think that with such challenges there is no need for support for NSE research from a DOE university program to supplement the effort. However, owing to the cyclic nature of such programs and the tendency in such efforts to focus on applied research as opposed tobasic research, infrastructure support, and education, the Committee believes that maintaining a stand-alone program to support general university-based NSE research is a key component of the DOE stewardship mission.(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:6.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri&amp;#34; %)¶ (% style=&amp;#34;font-size:4.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri&amp;#34; %)DEMAND FOR NSE GRADUATES(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:6.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri&amp;#34; %)¶ (% style=&amp;#34;font-size:4.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri&amp;#34; %)The needs of many U.S. Government agencies, as well as medical, manufacturing, R%26D, and energy industries, for educated nuclear scientists and engineers are widely recognized.

Also, an increased number of NSE graduates are now being sought for other federal agencies in addition to the DOE, including the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, NASA, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), many agencies of the intelligence community, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, and every uniformed service.(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:6.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri&amp;#34; %)¶ (% style=&amp;#34;font-size:4.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri&amp;#34; %)NSE human resources requirements also exist in the nuclear medical research, nuclear medicine, and medical physics communities, as well as in many other non-energy users of nuclear scientists and engineers.(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:6.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri&amp;#34; %)¶ (% style=&amp;#34;font-size:4.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri&amp;#34; %)Further stressing the limited human resources pool, many university nuclear engineering departments are seeking new faculty members and department heads, including the newly formed Nuclear Engineering Department at Idaho State University.(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:6.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri&amp;#34; %)¶ (% style=&amp;#34;font-size:4.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri&amp;#34; %)When conducting its research, the Committee found nearly uniform anecdotal evidence that the current production rate for NSE graduates is not sufficient to meet demand. For example, one division at one of the national laboratories has recently (unsuccessfully) sought 100 nuclear scientists and engineers, and Westinghouse, General Electric, AREVA, and the NRC are attempting to hire hundreds of engineers per year, many of them nuclear, from too small a pool of candidates.

In the same time period, many university nuclear reactors were constructed and commenced operations, providing key facilities needed for research as well as education of students engaged in this profession. Since the 1960s, U.S. universities have led the world in this technology with a commitment to furnish the necessary human resources and the associated infrastructure. In the 1990s the number of NSE programs at the undergraduate and graduate levels declined precipitously, particularly in the latter part of the decade, as Fig. 1 indicates.(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:6.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri&amp;#34; %)¶ (% style=&amp;#34;font-size:4.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri&amp;#34; %)The closures of these programs and departments were linked to the declines in enrollment of undergraduate and graduate students as well as in the research support from federal and industrial sources. Another feature compounding this problem is the aging nature of nuclear engineering faculty. More than two-thirds of current U.S. faculty are 45 years or older, and the rate of new faculty hiring diminished by more than 10% through the late 1990s.(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:6.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri&amp;#34; %)¶ (% style=&amp;#34;font-size:4.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri&amp;#34; %)Today, the demand for nuclear-educated personnel is again on the rise.

These facilities enabled students to obtain important hands-on understanding, familiarity, and respect for the unique requirements and challenges related to working with nuclear reactors, radioactivity, and radiation.

Most notably, (%%)core NSE research thrusts(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri&amp;#34; %) are generally not funded by the other federal research funding agencies (i.e., NSF, NIH, DOD, NASA, etc.) because they (%%)are viewed as the exclusive jurisdiction of the DOE, as set forth in the Atomic Energy Act. Recent statistics bear this out(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:6.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri&amp;#34; %). The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS)–NSF survey in 2004 for basic R%26D at universities indicates that engineering disciplines other than NSE receive a minor fraction of their R%26D funding from the DOE, in comparison to other federal agencies; i.e., less than 10 to 20% is due to the DOE for all other engineering disciplines compared to 40 to 60% for NSE programs as noted below.¶ (% style=&amp;#34;font-size:7.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri&amp;#34; %)Although university-based NSE programs often conduct research that is somewhat indirectly related to nuclear processes, (%%)funding(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:7.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri&amp;#34; %) for these activities (%%)is obtained primarily from(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:7.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri&amp;#34; %) basic research and mission-related (%%)programs within the DOE(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri&amp;#34; %). The Committee performed a survey of leading NSE programs for the same time period as the AAAS-NSF statistics in 2004. As Table 1 indicates, a majority of the funding for nuclear engineering programs is derived from the DOE and from the DOE/NE university program in particular. Although the overall fraction varies to some greater or lesser extent for any individual institution, it is substantial in comparison to other engineering disciplines.(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:6.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri&amp;#34; %)¶ (% style=&amp;#34;font-size:7.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri&amp;#34; %)In short, (%%)no other engineering discipline is as reliant on DOE research support as nuclear engineering(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:7.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri&amp;#34; %). As such, (%%)fluctuations in DOE funding inevitably have a tangible, even disproportionate, impact on(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:7.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri&amp;#34; %) both (%%)university-based NSE education and research programs in the U.S. nuclear education enterprise as a whole(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri&amp;#34; %).

Some of these new research efforts are supported by mission agencies including DOE/NE, DOE/NNSA, DOE/SC, and NRC.(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:3.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri&amp;#34; %) (% style=&amp;#34;font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri&amp;#34; %)However, the Committee firmly believes that (%%)the DOE must play an integrative role(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri&amp;#34; %) to fulfill the stewardship charter envisioned in the Atomic Energy Act.(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:6.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri&amp;#34; %)¶ (%%)This begins(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri&amp;#34; %) not only (%%)by(% style=&amp;#34;font-size: 8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri&amp;#34; %) maintaining the DOE/NE university program but also by (%%)expanding its scope and funding(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:6.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri&amp;#34; %). The program should monitor the mission-directed university-based NSE research effort to assure that the overall strength and health of the enterprise are maintained. Program personnel should also be watchful for trends that might make the research portfolio unhealthy. For example, one might easily imagine that the overall portfolio might be very much skewed toward near-term, applied research efforts, with little support for the long-term, basic research needed to further understand basic nuclear processes of importance to applications in the future. A separately funded NSE university program should support such mission-relevant, basic research efforts, as needed, to augment the mission-directed research efforts.¶ In addition, in the long run, the mission-directed NSE research efforts of the nation will need a healthy NSE infrastructure. (% style=&amp;#34;font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri&amp;#34; %)This need includes a healthy and reasonably sized fleet of (%%)university-based reactors for research(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri&amp;#34; %) and NSE education.

Contention 1 —- Leadership

Fusion’s the litmus test of U.S. energy leadership
Prager 11 (Stewart, Director – Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory and Professor of Astrophysical Sciences –  Princeton University, &amp;#34;How Seawater Can Power the World&amp;#34;, New York Times, 7-10, http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/11/opinion/11Prager.html?_r=1%26ref=opinion)

DEBATE about America’s energy supply is heating up: gas prices are rising, ethanol is under attack and nuclear power continues to struggle in the shadow of the Fukushima disaster in Japan.
But an abundant, safe and clean energy source once thought to be the stuff of science fiction is closer than many realize: nuclear fusion. Making it a reality, however, will take significant investment from the government at a time when spending on scientific research is under threat.
Harnessing nuclear fusion, the energy that powers the sun and the stars, has been a goal of physicists worldwide since the 1950s. It is essentially inexhaustible and it can be created using hydrogen isotopes — chemical cousins of hydrogen, like deuterium — that can readily be extracted from seawater.
Fusion energy is created by fusing two atomic nuclei, in the process converting mass to energy, which appears as heat. The heat, as in conventional nuclear fission reactors, turns water into steam, which drives turbines to generate electricity, or is used to produce fuels for transportation or other uses.
Fusion energy generates zero greenhouse gases. It offers no chance of a catastrophic accident. It can be available to all nations, relying only on the Earth’s oceans. When commercialized, it will transform the world’s energy supply.
There’s a catch. The development of fusion energy is one of the most difficult science and engineering challenges ever undertaken. Among other challenges, it requires production and confinement of a hot gas — a plasma — with a temperature around 100 million degrees Celsius.
But potential solutions to these daunting technical challenges are emerging. In one approach, 
AND
combustion engine, with multiple mini-explosions (about five per second).
Once a poorly understood area of research, plasma physics has become highly developed. Scientists not only produce 100 million-degree plasmas routinely, but they control and manipulate such &amp;#34;small suns&amp;#34; with remarkable finesse. Since 1970 the power produced by magnetic fusion in the lab has grown from one-tenth of a watt, produced for a fraction of a second, to 16 million watts produced for one second — a billionfold increase in fusion energy.
Seven partners — the European Union, China, India, Japan, Russia, South Korea and the United States — have teamed up on an experiment to produce 500 million watts of fusion power for 500 seconds and longer by 2020, demonstrating key scientific and engineering aspects of fusion at the scale of a reactor.
However, even though the United States is a contributor to this experiment, known as ITER, it has yet to commit to the full program needed to develop a domestic fusion reactor to produce electricity for the American power grid. Meanwhile other nations are moving forward to implement fusion as a key ingredient of their energy security.
Indeed, fusion research facilities more modern than anything in the United States are either under construction or operating in China, Germany, Japan and South Korea. The will and enthusiasm of governments in Asia to fill their energy needs with fusion, as soon as possible, is nearly palpable.
What has been lacking in the United States is the political and economic will. We need serious public investment to develop materials that can withstand the harsh fusion environment, sustain hot plasma indefinitely and integrate all these features in an experimental facility to produce continuous fusion power.
This won’t be cheap. A rough estimate is that it would take %2430 billion and 20 years to go from the current state of research to the first working fusion reactor. But put in perspective, that sum is equal to about a week of domestic energy consumption, or about 2 percent of the annual energy expenditure of %241.5 trillion.
Fusion used to be an energy source for my generation’s grandchildren; now, plans 
AND
that will shape our future. Scientists and engineers stand ready to help.

Federal funding is the focal point

The world we face in 2012 is of a different character than even a few years ago. Many developing nations are fragile states and are under enormous pressure from terrorism, endemic poverty, environmental challenges, debt, corruption, civil unrest, and regional, tribal, and religious conflicts. The result is a climate of despair, and potential breeding grounds for radical politics and extremism.
A successful American foreign policy must include thinking through actions and policies, and how 
AND
years. Too often we tend to confuse tactical action for strategic thinking. 
A matter of mutual understanding
American foreign policy has always required a principled realism that is true to our values as we face the world as it really is in all of its complexities. We need to accept the reality that there is not a short-term solution to every problem in the world. What we must do is manage these realities and complex problems, moving them into positions of solution possibilities and resolution.
American foreign policy has always dared to project a vision of a world where all 
AND
little margin for error with the stakes so high in the world today.
America must strengthen its global alliances. Common-interest alliances will be required in 
AND
economic, intelligence, diplomatic, humanitarian, military and law enforcement fields.
The centrality of alliances and multi-lateral institutions to a successful foreign policy is fundamental. Alliances and multi-lateral institutions must be understood as expansions of our influence, not as constraints on our power.  Alliances are imperfect, as are all institutions. But like &amp;#34;process,&amp;#34; they help absorb shocks.
Beyond military solutions
Alliances must be built on solid foundations to handle both routine and sudden unforeseen challenges. Crisis-driven &amp;#34;coalitions of the willing&amp;#34; by themselves are not the building blocks for a stable world. We need to think more broadly, deeply and strategically.
American military power and force structure cannot sustain its commitments without a shift to a more comprehensive strategic approach to global threats and a more flexible and agile military. Cyber warfare is a paramount example of these new threats.
The perception of American power around the world must not rest solely on a military orientation or optic. There must be an underlying commitment to engagement and humanity. Engagement is not appeasement, nor is it negotiation. It is not a guarantee of anything, but rather a smart diplomatic bridge to better understanding and possible conflict resolution.
American foreign policy must reflect the realities and demands of the global economy. The 
AND
strength must be as high a priority as any other foreign policy priority.
America’s security and growth are connected to both the American and global economies. A centerpiece of this security is energy security. Energy security and energy interdependence are interconnected parts of a broad and deep foreign policy paradigm that frames the complexity of the challenges that face America and the world.

Recommendations
The proposed FY2013 budget does not set FES on a path to create a workforce commensurate with the goals of full utilization of ITER, the development of a follow-on experiment, and the subsequent commercialization of fusion energy. These goals have been repeatedly outlined by FESAC and explicitly endorsed by multiple outside review committees and auditors.
Cutting support for Ph.D training and closing university-based fusion research facilities will &amp;#34;break the pipeline&amp;#34; of the next generation of fusion researchers. Furthermore, when highly trained workers leave fusion research, they cannot easily be replaced or rehired when a new facility finally opens. Managing and developing the workforce is thus a critical part of any plan that is to be developed by FESAC and the FES program.

With the political will and the right investment, the potential strategic gains for the U.S. in the aggressive development and deployment of fusion power plants are extraordinary. These would include:
• Clean, safe, sustainable, and affordable electricity generation in the U.S. and the world;
• Energy independence and associated freedom from foreign countries for our energy supplies;
• Transition to an electricity-generating economy to power our cars and trucks;
• Elimination of the actinides in spent nuclear-fuel by building fusion/fission hybrid plants (using the high neutron fields from fusion to transmute the actinides in spent fuel and thereby render the spent fuel non-toxic within 200 years – not tens of thousands of years);
• The two-fold boost to the U.S. economy of reducing our huge trade imbalance by eliminating the cost of importing oil and making the U.S. a world-leader in the energy market by providing fusion generating plants for the whole world;
• Creation of a large number of jobs in building and maintaining commercialized fusion power plants;

PCAST believes that technology has now advanced to the point that it can and should play a leading role in driving educational innovation. Moreover, we believe that STEM education should be the leading wedge for such change. In this chapter, we therefore recommend that the Federal Government launch a major new initiative in educational R%26D tied to information technologies. Our recommendation is rooted in several observations.
• First, educational technology has been advancing rapidly in recent years and is likely to create major strides in the near future. From a scientific and technological standpoint, there is unprecedented ferment in the field.
• Second, there will be a growing need for new instructional materials, new professional development materials, and new kinds of assessments that are aligned with higher standards and provide much richer learning experiences and more vibrant sources of information. To that end, technology has the ability to shorten innovation cycles, expand the market of suppliers, and assess learning in deeper ways. It also has the capability to respond to the diverse learning styles of students.150
• Third, the ’’collection and use of data’’ is one of the Department of Education’s four assurances. Technology is a powerful tool in support of this goal, because it provides efficient ways to gather, integrate, and analyze rich and diverse data streams to evaluate and improve programs.
• Fourth, technology is becoming increasingly affordable, accessible, and versatile. This trend will continue over the next decades, and will encompass personal and mobile devices.
• Fifth, today’s students are increasingly digital natives. They are used to technology and have come to expect high-quality uses of technology.
• Sixth, instructional materials for students and teachers developed in the United States could have uses throughout the world, bringing together students and educators in partnerships and activities that will benefit all participants and contributing to the Nation’s outreach to the next generation of students throughout the world.
• Finally, while the provision of education is the province of the states, only the Federal Government has the ability to fund the basic R%26D necessary to develop truly transforming platforms and instructional materials for education. State and local educational authorities lack the necessary resources or scale.

On the other hand, the DOE NSE education support programs cannot, alone, provide the resources needed for a healthy and comprehensive national effort. University‐based NSE programs must continue to aggressively seek and obtain research and education support from mission agencies, basic research funding organizations, national laboratories, and industry.
In short, the Committee believes DOE’s stewardship role is to continuously monitor the NSE education enterprise to ensure that it meets present and future national needs and to conduct a modest research, development, and education program, to appropriately augment other federal and industry supporting efforts, assuring the near‐ and long‐term robustness and health of the discipline to address national needs.

Posture of the United States (the Schlesinger–Perry Commission) stated:
The triad of strategic delivery systems continues to have value. Each leg of the nuclear triad, comprised of heavy bombers, intercontinental- range ballistic missiles (ICBMs), and sub-marine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), provides unique contributions to stability. As the overall force shrinks, their unique values become more prominent.1
President Barack Obama has expressed support for modernization of the U.S. nuclear arsenal, but the Administration now appears to be backing out of its commitment.

Perceptions of a compromised U.S. nuclear deterrent as described above would have profound policy implications, particularly if they emerge at a time when a nuclear-armed great power is pursuing a more aggressive strategy toward U.S. allies and partners in its region in a bid to enhance its regional and global clout. 
■  A dangerous period of vulnerability would open for the United States and those nations that depend on U.S. protection while the United States attempted to rectify th problems with its nuclear forces. As it would take more than a decade for the United States to produce new nuclear weapons, ensuing events could preclude a return to anything like the status quo ante.
■ The assertive, nuclear-armed great power, and other major adversaries, could be willing to challenge U.S. interests more directly in the expectation that the United States would be less prepared to threaten or deliver a military response that could lead to direct conflict. They will want to keep the United States from reclaiming its earlier power position.
■ Allies and partners who have relied upon explicit or implicit assurances of U.S. nuclear protection as a foundation of their security could lose faith in those assurances. They could compensate by accommodating U.S. rivals, especially in the short term, or acquiring their own nuclear deterrents, which in most cases could be accomplished only over the mid- to long term. A more nuclear world would likely ensue over a period of years.
■ Important U.S. interests could be compromised or abandoned, or a major war could occur as adversaries and/or the United States miscalculate new boundaries of deterrence and provocation. At worst, war could lead to state-on-state employment of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) on a scale far more catastrophic than what nuclear-armed terrorists alone could inflict.

&amp;#34;Despite fusion’s tantalizing benefits, it has been largely ignored in energy policy discussions because it is viewed as a technology too immature to affect energy production over the next few decades, when it is most needed,&amp;#34; says the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The lab, which is part of a %243.5 billion research effort to help commercialize fusion, says that the United States is in a &amp;#34;unique position to change this paradigm.&amp;#34;
To be clear, fusion is different from fission, which is how today’s nuclear reactor’s produce energy. Fission splits atoms apart whereas fusion combines them — a process that thus far consumes more energy than it generates. The aim, though, is to heat the hydrogen gas to more than 100 million degrees Celsius so that the atoms will bond instead of bounce off each another.
If scientists are ultimately able to achieve success, the end result would be the production of 10 million times more power than a typical chemical reaction, such as the burning of fossil fuels. And it would occur without the carbon emissions or the disposal of high-level radioactive waste.
To that end, an international consortium has already spent %2420 billion on fusion

Superconducting devices are so accurate they define the &amp;#34;Volt,&amp;#34; goes the saying. The true testament to the intrinsic accuracy that results from the properties of superconductors is that the metrology standard for realizing the electrical unit of &amp;#34;Volt&amp;#34; is indeed a superconducting circuit. In addition to accuracy, superconductors enable the most sensitive detectors of electromagnetic radiation and are used in scientific research both at ground-based astronomy observatories as well as in space-based NASA missions.
Instrumentation
The earliest applications of superconducting electronics were, and continue to be, custom instruments based primarily on superb sensitivity in detecting magnetic fields. These instruments are based on various designs of SQUIDs and find applications in research laboratories for physics, chemistry, and materials science research as well as in field geological expeditions such as airborne detection of salt domes, a frequent indicator of potential new oil fields.

Escalates conflict with Iran —- goes global and nuclear
Williams 10 – Lawrence, Adjunct Professor of Humanities and Social Sciences – Indian Institute of Technology-Madras and Ph.D. in Defense and Strategic Studies – University of Madras, &amp;#34;Peril Awaits at the Strait of Hormuz&amp;#34;, 7-22, http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-religion/2557996/posts)

The Gulf-Southwest Asia region has always been a hyper-flash point of 
AND
in Iran and the domino effect that has followed by the Arab states.
Iran holds the position of a pivotal state in the Gulf Region and has been 
AND
-western allied Arab states and the lone free democratic state of Israel.
Geo-strategic importance of the Strait: The maritime archipelagic framework of the Gulf-Southwest Asian region is characterized by the Persian Gulf (also known as &amp;#34;Gulf&amp;#34; avoiding the contending Persian and Arab nomenclature claims), Strait of Hormuz and Gulf of Oman constituting a primary jugular of the sea way of the region.
The topography of the Strait is complex with the narrowest point the Strait being 21 miles wide. The shipping lanes consist of two-mile wide channels for inbound and outbound tanker traffic, as well as a two-mile wide buffer zone.
Iran’s access to the Strait and the pivotal role as a littoral state to control shipping movements with the capability to jeopardize international shipping has been a critical sinew of strength. In terms of its power profile, Iran could marshal its economic, military and demographic power to overwhelm the fragile states of the Arabian Peninsula that includes the regional giant Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States.
The geo-strategic significance of the Strait of Hormuz would continue to increase in 
AND
like China and India which have very critical hydrocarbon stakes in the region.
The Iranian move to close the strait would have a very steep impact of jeopardizing

AND
US and Western naval and air intervention and support that comes into the region

It thus brings India into the Gulf Region with a secure access agreement.

targets in a prospective joint US-led strike against Iranian nuclear installations.
Five, In an event of a conflagration in the Strait of Hormuz, there 
AND
Iranian leadership that is determined to stall a US-led preemptive strike.
These naval operational realities cloud and condition the naval theatre of the Strait of Hormuz that is increasingly vulnerable and prone to assertive asymmetric strikes / counter strikes by Iran.
Sources of Iranian Conduct and Responses: Iran’s template of operational conduct and responses is 
AND
the Iranians in their strategic calculus have always been calculated in their responses.
The penchant of an Iranian overdrive by an asymmetric operational strategy either by missile strikes or by naval disruptions could be either as an initiative to subdue the militarily weaker but the oil-rich Sunni Gulf Arab states and Saudi Arabia or as an attempt to deflect US-Israeli targeting by inciting the Hezbollah-Hamas terrorist brigades which are in effect the auxiliary units of the IRGC.
A second source of Iranian strategic conduct emerges from its maritime aspirations to control the Gulf and Caspian Sea. With both seas being critically important as oil and natural gas rich repositories, Iran would prefer to maintain sea-control and sea-denial capabilities employing an asymmetric operational approach of sea-based strike missiles, submarines and aggressive naval posturing that could dent the effectiveness of any naval interventionist force.
The third possible source of Iranian asymmetric conduct could come from its keen interest in 
AND
of Hormuz off the Arabian Sea coast could simply paralyze all interventionist forces.
Iranian responses to an offensive strike could include the intense barrage of sea-skimming 
AND
per barrel or even more dealing with a decimation to the global economy.

Iranian missiles push the U.S. out of the Gulf —- detection’s key
OA 12 – Oxford Analytica, &amp;#34;Iran’s Missile Assets May Constrain US Threat Response&amp;#34;, 1-6, http://www.oxan.com/Analysis/DailyBrief/Samples/IranMissileAssets.aspx

Analysis
Iran has a fairly well-developed indigenous capacity to produce missiles, with particular strength in anti-ship and ballistic designs. Technical help has come from North Korea in exchange for Iranian investment to bankroll the necessary research; China has also had input, and Iranian scientists have been adapting and improving Chinese designs.
Anti-ship missiles
The naval exercise earlier this week showcased two new assets:
The Qader is a domestically produced system with a range of 200 kilometres, designed to be launched from either sea or land to hit large surface vessels. It is a sea-skimming missile, is not ballistic and cannot carry a nuclear warhead.
The Noor missile is similar to the Qader: both are based on the Chinese C-802, although the Noor has a longer range. While the Noor in the latest case was launched from a ship, in the event of any hostilities in the Persian Gulf, Iran would most likely rely on its land-based missile assets.
Western naval vessels would have the defensive capabilities to cope with Iranian anti-ship 
AND
and the like; these will degrade the performance of defensive radar systems.

All three countries face transitions that could make them more vulnerable to Iranian influence - for instance, if the Palestinian majority plays more of a role in the government of Jordan or the Muslim Brotherhood in that of Egypt. However, these developments are particularly difficult to foretell. What is much clearer is that these nations are unlikely to serve as bulwarks against emerging Iranian hegemony in the region.
In addition, since 2008, both the Israeli government and the majority of Israeli voters have grown suspicious of U.S. support, in response to various reports about President Obama’s viewpoints and acts.

Research and Development Defined
Federal energy-related R%26D can be described as falling into three classes: basic research, research that seeks to develop new energy technologies, and research that seeks to improve existing technologies.
• Basic Research. The potential beneficiaries of basic research could be considered to be the population of the United States or the world as a whole. Basic research includes research projects designed to pursue the advancement of scientific knowledge and the understanding of phenomena rather than specific applications.
• Research To Develop New Technologies. The efforts in this context involve attempts to discover new scientific knowledge that can have commercial application. Although the end objective of the research is known, the research task is difficult and uncertain.
• Research To Improve Existing Technologies. These efforts emphasize the use of scientific knowledge to design and test new processes that may have substantial technical and cost uncertainties. The immediate beneficiaries are generally well defined: current producers and consumers of particular fuels or operators, and customers of the technology being improved.
Energy Research and Development as a Subsidy
It is easier to measure energy R%26D spending than to it characterize from a subsidy perspective. R%26D spending is intended to create useful knowledge that benefits society. Thus, all Federal R%26D spending could, in a general way, be considered a subsidy to knowledge; however, the extent to which specific R%26D programs actually affect energy markets is more difficult to ascertain.
The results of research are inherently uncertain. Many programs will advance knowledge across a 
AND
likely to be measurable only years after the funded research effort is initiated.

AND
the program will be a substitute for private-sector R%26D.

&#xD;
====Fusion~’s the litmus test of U.S. energy leadership====&#xD;
**Prager 11** (Stewart, Director – Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory and Professor of Astrophysical Sciences –  Princeton University, &amp;#34;How Seawater Can Power the World&amp;#34;, New York Times, 7-10, http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/11/opinion/11Prager.html?_r=1%26ref=opinion)&#xD;
&#xD;
DEBATE about America~’s energy supply is heating up: gas prices are rising, ethanol is under attack and nuclear power continues to struggle in the shadow of the Fukushima disaster in Japan.&#xD;
But an abundant, safe and clean energy source once thought to be the stuff of science fiction is closer than many realize: nuclear fusion. Making it a reality, however, will take significant investment from the government at a time when spending on scientific research is under threat.&#xD;
Harnessing nuclear fusion, the energy that powers the sun and the stars, has been a goal of physicists worldwide since the 1950s. It is essentially inexhaustible and it can be created using hydrogen isotopes — chemical cousins of hydrogen, like deuterium — that can readily be extracted from seawater.&#xD;
Fusion energy is created by fusing two atomic nuclei, in the process converting mass to energy, which appears as heat. The heat, as in conventional nuclear fission reactors, turns water into steam, which drives turbines to generate electricity, or is used to produce fuels for transportation or other uses.&#xD;
Fusion energy generates zero greenhouse gases. It offers no chance of a catastrophic accident. It can be available to all nations, relying only on the Earth~’s oceans. When commercialized, it will transform the world~’s energy supply.&#xD;
There~’s a catch. The development of fusion energy is one of the most difficult science and engineering challenges ever undertaken. Among other challenges, it requires production and confinement of a hot gas — a plasma — with a temperature around 100 million degrees Celsius.&#xD;
But potential solutions to these daunting technical challenges are emerging. In one approach, &#xD;
AND&#xD;
combustion engine, with multiple mini-explosions (about five per second).&#xD;
Once a poorly understood area of research, plasma physics has become highly developed. Scientists not only produce 100 million-degree plasmas routinely, but they control and manipulate such &amp;#34;small suns&amp;#34; with remarkable finesse. Since 1970 the power produced by magnetic fusion in the lab has grown from one-tenth of a watt, produced for a fraction of a second, to 16 million watts produced for one second — a billionfold increase in fusion energy.&#xD;
Seven partners — the European Union, China, India, Japan, Russia, South Korea and the United States — have teamed up on an experiment to produce 500 million watts of fusion power for 500 seconds and longer by 2020, demonstrating key scientific and engineering aspects of fusion at the scale of a reactor.&#xD;
However, even though the United States is a contributor to this experiment, known as ITER, it has yet to commit to the full program needed to develop a domestic fusion reactor to produce electricity for the American power grid. Meanwhile other nations are moving forward to implement fusion as a key ingredient of their energy security.&#xD;
Indeed, fusion research facilities more modern than anything in the United States are either under construction or operating in China, Germany, Japan and South Korea. The will and enthusiasm of governments in Asia to fill their energy needs with fusion, as soon as possible, is nearly palpable.&#xD;
What has been lacking in the United States is the political and economic will. We need serious public investment to develop materials that can withstand the harsh fusion environment, sustain hot plasma indefinitely and integrate all these features in an experimental facility to produce continuous fusion power.&#xD;
This won~’t be cheap. A rough estimate is that it would take %2430 billion and 20 years to go from the current state of research to the first working fusion reactor. But put in perspective, that sum is equal to about a week of domestic energy consumption, or about 2 percent of the annual energy expenditure of %241.5 trillion.&#xD;
Fusion used to be an energy source for my generation~’s grandchildren; now, plans &#xD;
AND&#xD;
that will shape our future. Scientists and engineers stand ready to help.&#xD;

&#xD;
It is not only axiomatic but also true that federal science policy is largely played &#xD;

To get a feel for the depth of this worldview, consider the National Institutes &#xD;

Given the totemic importance of the federal R%26D budget, and the centrality of the budget in S%26T policy discourse, what can we learn about the U.S. science and technology enterprise from an examination of budgetary trends? The first thing to be said is that it depends on which trends one chooses to examine.&#xD;

The world we face in 2012 is of a different character than even a few years ago. Many developing nations are fragile states and are under enormous pressure from terrorism, endemic poverty, environmental challenges, debt, corruption, civil unrest, and regional, tribal, and religious conflicts. The result is a climate of despair, and potential breeding grounds for radical politics and extremism.&#xD;
A successful American foreign policy must include thinking through actions and policies, and how &#xD;
AND&#xD;
years. Too often we tend to confuse tactical action for strategic thinking. &#xD;
A matter of mutual understanding&#xD;
American foreign policy has always required a principled realism that is true to our values as we face the world as it really is in all of its complexities. We need to accept the reality that there is not a short-term solution to every problem in the world. What we must do is manage these realities and complex problems, moving them into positions of solution possibilities and resolution.&#xD;
American foreign policy has always dared to project a vision of a world where all &#xD;
AND&#xD;
little margin for error with the stakes so high in the world today.&#xD;
America must strengthen its global alliances. Common-interest alliances will be required in &#xD;
AND&#xD;
economic, intelligence, diplomatic, humanitarian, military and law enforcement fields.&#xD;
The centrality of alliances and multi-lateral institutions to a successful foreign policy is fundamental. Alliances and multi-lateral institutions must be understood as expansions of our influence, not as constraints on our power.  Alliances are imperfect, as are all institutions. But like &amp;#34;process,&amp;#34; they help absorb shocks.&#xD;
Beyond military solutions&#xD;
Alliances must be built on solid foundations to handle both routine and sudden unforeseen challenges. Crisis-driven &amp;#34;coalitions of the willing&amp;#34; by themselves are not the building blocks for a stable world. We need to think more broadly, deeply and strategically.&#xD;
American military power and force structure cannot sustain its commitments without a shift to a more comprehensive strategic approach to global threats and a more flexible and agile military. Cyber warfare is a paramount example of these new threats.&#xD;
The perception of American power around the world must not rest solely on a military orientation or optic. There must be an underlying commitment to engagement and humanity. Engagement is not appeasement, nor is it negotiation. It is not a guarantee of anything, but rather a smart diplomatic bridge to better understanding and possible conflict resolution.&#xD;
American foreign policy must reflect the realities and demands of the global economy. The &#xD;
AND&#xD;
strength must be as high a priority as any other foreign policy priority.&#xD;
America~’s security and growth are connected to both the American and global economies. A centerpiece of this security is energy security. Energy security and energy interdependence are interconnected parts of a broad and deep foreign policy paradigm that frames the complexity of the challenges that face America and the world.&#xD;

Recommendations
The proposed FY2013 budget does not set FES on a path to create a workforce commensurate with the goals of full utilization of ITER, the development of a follow-on experiment, and the subsequent commercialization of fusion energy. These goals have been repeatedly outlined by FESAC and explicitly endorsed by multiple outside review committees and auditors.
Cutting support for Ph.D training and closing university-based fusion research facilities will &amp;#34;break the pipeline&amp;#34; of the next generation of fusion researchers. Furthermore, when highly trained workers leave fusion research, they cannot easily be replaced or rehired when a new facility finally opens. Managing and developing the workforce is thus a critical part of any plan that is to be developed by FESAC and the FES program.
Universities are indispensable to creating the U.S. fusion workforce. The 2004

With the political will and the right investment, the potential strategic gains for the U.S. in the aggressive development and deployment of fusion power plants are extraordinary. These would include:
• Clean, safe, sustainable, and affordable electricity generation in the U.S. and the world;
• Energy independence and associated freedom from foreign countries for our energy supplies;
• Transition to an electricity-generating economy to power our cars and trucks;
• Elimination of the actinides in spent nuclear-fuel by building fusion/fission hybrid plants (using the high neutron fields from fusion to transmute the actinides in spent fuel and thereby render the spent fuel non-toxic within 200 years – not tens of thousands of years);
• The two-fold boost to the U.S. economy of reducing our huge trade imbalance by eliminating the cost of importing oil and making the U.S. a world-leader in the energy market by providing fusion generating plants for the whole world;
• Creation of a large number of jobs in building and maintaining commercialized fusion power plants;
• Demonstration of how U.S. leadership in technology can be leveraged to drive leadership in energy; and
• Increase interest and high-paying jobs for young people going into scientific and engineering fields.

PCAST believes that technology has now advanced to the point that it can and should play a leading role in driving educational innovation. Moreover, we believe that STEM education should be the leading wedge for such change. In this chapter, we therefore recommend that the Federal Government launch a major new initiative in educational R%26D tied to information technologies. Our recommendation is rooted in several observations.
• First, educational technology has been advancing rapidly in recent years and is likely to create major strides in the near future. From a scientific and technological standpoint, there is unprecedented ferment in the field.
• Second, there will be a growing need for new instructional materials, new professional development materials, and new kinds of assessments that are aligned with higher standards and provide much richer learning experiences and more vibrant sources of information. To that end, technology has the ability to shorten innovation cycles, expand the market of suppliers, and assess learning in deeper ways. It also has the capability to respond to the diverse learning styles of students.150
• Third, the ~’~’collection and use of data~’~’ is one of the Department of Education~’s four assurances. Technology is a powerful tool in support of this goal, because it provides efficient ways to gather, integrate, and analyze rich and diverse data streams to evaluate and improve programs.
• Fourth, technology is becoming increasingly affordable, accessible, and versatile. This trend will continue over the next decades, and will encompass personal and mobile devices.
• Fifth, today~’s students are increasingly digital natives. They are used to technology and have come to expect high-quality uses of technology.
• Sixth, instructional materials for students and teachers developed in the United States could have uses throughout the world, bringing together students and educators in partnerships and activities that will benefit all participants and contributing to the Nation~’s outreach to the next generation of students throughout the world.
• Finally, while the provision of education is the province of the states, only the Federal Government has the ability to fund the basic R%26D necessary to develop truly transforming platforms and instructional materials for education. State and local educational authorities lack the necessary resources or scale.

Disclosure of Stockpiles
An essential component of robust future nuclear arms reduction agreements will be the declaration of existing stockpiles of weapons and fissile materials to establish baseline data against which to measure future reductions. Without a declaration that specifies how many and what kind of nuclear materials are where, it will be difficult - if not impossible - to verify whether a country is complying with the agreed limitations.
To establish a meaningful baseline for reductions, this declaration should include the number of 
AND
the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces and the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaties.
This declaration can provide the basis for building the confidence needed to make sizeable reductions 
AND
nuclear disarmament. Further public declarations could follow as confidence and transparency increase.
Official disclosure of stockpile numbers by the US and Russia is key to expanding agreements 
AND
as it calculates the impact of nuclear arms reductions on its national security.
The inventory (amounts, location, and form) of highly-enriched uranium 
AND
must be paid to monitoring delivery systems, particularly those with dual capabilities.
Verification Technology
As the numbers of nuclear weapons decrease, any uncertainties in the arsenals of other 
AND
sensitive information (restricted data) relating to nuclear weapon design or manufacturing.
The verification challenges are many:
• First: determine the requirements to verify inventories of special nuclear material, production capabilities, and numbers of weapons;
• Second: assess the state of technology necessary to meet those requirements;
• Third: develop any needed science and technology (S%26T);
• Fourth: determine whether that S%26T could reveal information that would compromise U.S. national security;
• And fifth: develop methods to protect the security of our assets.
A further challenge is to make certain the verification happens in a manner that does not reveal weapons details to non-nuclear weapon states as proscribed by Article I of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, or classified information reflecting national security interests and controlled through relevant U.S. laws and regulations.4
Recent monitoring and inspection practices affecting the United States and Russia focused on verifying the 
AND
agreements the techniques employed and the inspectors must guarantee international assurance of compliance.
Each reduction involving nuclear weapons offers possibilities for monitoring and verification that can confirm that the states are honoring their commitments. Verification will likely include two complementary efforts: confirming declared activities and detecting clandestine materials or operations. Science and Technology and Research and Development are needed to enable such steps.
In terms of the diagram below, the verification of declared disposition is straightforward, paralleling IAEA safeguards on direct-use fissile material in non-nuclear weapon States. Such verification will require the use of specialized methods and managed access.
A number of storage and dismantlement verification technologies — focused primarily in the areas of radiation detection, remote monitoring, and tamper-indicating devices — were developed over the last 15 years to support a variety of negotiations and exercises. These technologies may be applicable to support verification throughout the dismantlement process, including monitoring and verification of weapons removed from operational deployment through various storage conditions and disassembly processes to the end states of disposed uranium and plutonium.
High-quality radiation measurements are central to determining that a weapon or material is 
AND
in developing information barrier design concepts and a legal framework and deployment arrangement.

Because nuclear arsenals could be rebuilt, much of the effort in establishing a disarmament 
AND
to be designed to enable states to rearm at essentially equal rates.8
In addition to a carefully designed rearmament plan, disarmament would have to wait until 
AND
good that the possibility of an adversarial relationship had become non-existent.
Disarmament would also require that all non-nuclear states with the potential to build 
AND
arsenals and could well be the first states to violate the disarmament regime.
As long as political relations remained so good, disarmament could not significantly reduce the probability of major-power war. Under these political conditions, states would not get into crises, and would not fight conventional or nuclear wars, whether or not they deployed nuclear weapons. Therefore, under these conditions disarmament would avoid wasting scarce resources, but would not increase states~’ security.
The impact of disarmament on nuclear war thus hinges on how well it would work 
AND
is a serious possibility, disarmament would probably collapse into a rearmament race.
So, is deliberate nuclear war more likely when states are engaged in a rearmament 
AND
the promise of forthcoming deployments, thus returning safely to a nuclear world.
In contrast, the nuclear world promises to avoid all of these asymmetries and vulnerabilities

irrationally - but this seems just as likely in the formerly disarmed world.

Planning for Nuclear Abolition
Speaking in Prague on April 5, Obama declared &amp;#34;America~’s commitment to seek the 
AND
NPT nuclear-weapon states, including agreement on transparency measures.~~11~~
Dialogue among these five countries on the goal of nuclear abolition will assuredly accelerate in the months ahead. As part of that dialogue, U.S. officials could not only encourage or support joint studies and experiments but also explore possible development of an action plan for nuclear disarmament.
Joint Studies and Experiments
The United Kingdom has already conducted its own technical assessment of verification of nuclear disarmament
AND
joint experiment on the monitored storage of nuclear warheads prior to their elimination.
Nuclear Transparency
The time has come for a favorable response to Sarkozy~’s call for agreed transparency measures
AND
the basis for a joint transparency initiative at the 2010 NPT Review Conference.
Nuclear Abolition Action Plan
Finally, the five countries should pursue their own action plan for nuclear abolition. 
AND
take at the review conference, and pave the way for later action.
Conclusion
The Obama administration has moved swiftly to take arms control out of the &amp;#34;cold storage&amp;#34; where it was relegated by the Bush administration. The primary focus of the new administration has rightly been on resetting the U.S.-Russian strategic relationship and on negotiating a replacement for START. The administration also has acted to reinvigorate the strategic dialogue with China, while signaling support for a wider nuclear dialogue among the five NPT nuclear-weapon states.
In pursuing these goals, U.S. officials can draw on a rich 
AND
integrate China into the bilateral U.S.-Russian arms control process.
The bottom line of this analysis can be stated quite simply: as part of an expanded arms control toolbox, many different cooperative security activities can contribute to reshaping the U.S.-Russian and U.S.-Chinese strategic relationships successfully, as well as building habits of cooperation among the five NPT nuclear-weapon states. U.S. officials and their counterparts in other countries should take advantage of the full spectrum of these activities.

&#xD;
&amp;#34;Despite fusion~’s tantalizing benefits, it has been largely ignored in energy policy discussions because it is viewed as a technology too immature to affect energy production over the next few decades, when it is most needed,&amp;#34; says the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The lab, which is part of a %243.5 billion research effort to help commercialize fusion, says that the United States is in a &amp;#34;unique position to change this paradigm.&amp;#34;&#xD;
To be clear, fusion is different from fission, which is how today~’s nuclear reactor~’s produce energy. Fission splits atoms apart whereas fusion combines them — a process that thus far consumes more energy than it generates. The aim, though, is to heat the hydrogen gas to more than 100 million degrees Celsius so that the atoms will bond instead of bounce off each another.&#xD;
If scientists are ultimately able to achieve success, the end result would be the production of 10 million times more power than a typical chemical reaction, such as the burning of fossil fuels. And it would occur without the carbon emissions or the disposal of high-level radioactive waste.&#xD;
To that end, an international consortium has already spent %2420 billion on fusion &#xD;
AND&#xD;
the scientific and engineering skills needed to bring such a concept to scale.&#xD;
What immediate benefits do those participants get from funding ITER, or from making their own national investments in nuclear fusion? Magnet technology is one area, which is used in medical devices such as magnetic resonance imagery that allows doctor~’s see completely inside the human brain.&#xD;
That~’s what Michael Claessens, head of communications for ITER Organization, explained to this reporter in an email. Superconducting and advanced materials are two additional benefits, he notes, adding that more such bonuses will occur in the future, as it does with any high-level research.&#xD;

&#xD;
Superconducting devices are so accurate they define the &amp;#34;Volt,&amp;#34; goes the saying. The true testament to the intrinsic accuracy that results from the properties of superconductors is that the metrology standard for realizing the electrical unit of &amp;#34;Volt&amp;#34; is indeed a superconducting circuit. In addition to accuracy, superconductors enable the most sensitive detectors of electromagnetic radiation and are used in scientific research both at ground-based astronomy observatories as well as in space-based NASA missions.&#xD;
Instrumentation&#xD;
The earliest applications of superconducting electronics were, and continue to be, custom instruments based primarily on superb sensitivity in detecting magnetic fields. These instruments are based on various designs of SQUIDs and find applications in research laboratories for physics, chemistry, and materials science research as well as in field geological expeditions such as airborne detection of salt domes, a frequent indicator of potential new oil fields.&#xD;

&#xD;
So could this island dispute spark off a full blown war? Well, if you take a look at how most wars begin it~’s always in the wake of something small or remote happening. Such as when two people end up in a fight over an initial remark. The Balkan countries after all acted as the stage to spark the last world wars.&#xD;
So, in a nuclear age when nuclear war has disappeared from popular debate and &#xD;
AND&#xD;
up before we see the knock on results of greed damaging the environment.&#xD;
So, let~’s look at the strength of the two countries . . .&#xD;
Population&#xD;
Japan: 126,500,000 – China: 1,350,000,000&#xD;
As you can see the population of China far exceeds that of Japan. This could be a positive thing for drafting soldiers but also would spell more casualties.&#xD;
Military Manpower Available&#xD;
Japan: 53,600,000 – China: 750,500,000&#xD;
The manpower available clearly tips in China~’s direction here.&#xD;
Active Military Personnel&#xD;
Japan: 240,000 – China: 2,300,000&#xD;
Trained military personnel in China clearly outweighs Japan~’s trained and active military personnel.&#xD;
Total Naval Units&#xD;
Japan: 110 – China: 972&#xD;
Without allies coming to bolster the amount of ships available to Japan, China would have the upper hand. China also has more submarines, an aircraft carrier and more frigates and destroyers.&#xD;
Defence Budget/Expenditure&#xD;
Japan: %2470,500,000,000 – China: %24100,000,000,000&#xD;
Here the two countries are not far off each other. Japan is a more developed nation with a stronger economy when it comes to nation size comparison of course.&#xD;
Economy and Allies&#xD;
Here~’s where Japan excels economy wise, as it has the second largest economy for &#xD;
AND&#xD;
. However, Japan has one enormous ally and that is the USA.&#xD;
China has the fastest growing economy in the world after opening up to the rest &#xD;
AND&#xD;
the USA and China are strained at times, to say the least.&#xD;
China is not an isolationist country but it is quite nationalistic. Their allies include, Russia, which is a big super power, Pakistan and Iran as well as North Korea. They have more allies than Japan, although most relations have been built on economic strategies, being a money-centric nation.&#xD;
Countries potentially hostile toward China in the event of a Japan vs. China war include Germany, Britain, Australia and South Korea. So even though Japan does not outwardly build relationships with allies, Japan would have allies rallying around them if China were to attack Japan.&#xD;
The island dispute would not play out as it did in the UK vs. Argentina island dispute, as both sides could cause massive damage to each other, whereas the UK was far superior in firepower compared to Argentina.&#xD;
Conclusion&#xD;
Even though China outweighs Japan in numbers, the likelihood that a war would develop into a nuclear war means that numbers don~’t really mean anything anymore. The nuclear capabilities of Japan and China would mean that each country could destroy each other many times over. The island dispute would then escalate to  possible mass extinction for the human race.&#xD;
The nuclear fall out would affect most of Asia and to a certain extent the &#xD;
AND&#xD;
maybe 20 years at best, if there are ample supplies of course.&#xD;

&#xD;
Now, the other part of the question is - why the U.S. federal government in particular, and not state governments? Before we get to that, one thing should be mentioned here. Unlike in most fields of research, fusion is one where the United States does not dominate. U.S. domestic fusion research was about %24299-million in Fiscal Year 2012; it was multiple times higher than that in the European Union. The U.S. contribution to the ITER project is 9% - the same level as India, South Korea, Japan, China, and Russia. Europe is paying 46%. So while it~’s often a good assumption that U.S. research in a field ~~= world research in a field, this is not the case for fusion. Funding for fusion in this country is about a third (in real terms) of what it was in the ~’70s and ~’80s during the oil crisis, when energy research was briefly taken extremely seriously on a national level — see the graph here:http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:U.S._historical_fusion_budget_vs._1976_ERDA_plan.png (I made this graph and it~’s freely available to use - click it to get the full-resolution version.)&#xD;

A number of Republicans had insisted on offsetting spending cuts. But Boehner~’s decision was &#xD;
AND&#xD;
be taken by the new Congress that~’s due to be sworn in tomorrow.&#xD;
Obama lost on fiscal cliff —- jacks his agenda&#xD;
Kurtz 1-1 – Howard, Washington Bureau Chief for Newsweek, &amp;#34;Obama Fiscal Cliff Victory Could Invite Years of Warfare With the GOP&amp;#34;, The Daily Beast, 2013, http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/01/01/obama-fiscal-cliff-victory-could-invite-years-of-warfare-with-the-gop.html&#xD;
&#xD;
The president is riding high now that many Republicans have joined in raising taxes on the wealthy. But Howard Kurtz says it could prove a pyrrhic victory that could threaten his second-term agenda.&#xD;
President Obama clearly won the fiscal cliff skirmish on Tuesday as he faced down the Republicans, forcing them despite years of fervent promises to raise tax rates on the wealthy. But he also made concessions over New Year~’s weekend that could weaken his hand in future battles.&#xD;

Beating back a conservative revolt in his party, Speaker John Boehner brought to the House floor the compromise bill passed in a predawn session in the Senate. The bill passed late Tuesday night, with Nancy Pelosi~’s Democrats providing 172 votes, enough to offset substantial Republican defections. Eighty-five Republicans voted for the bill.&#xD;
The measure will restore the Bush tax cuts for individuals making less than %24400,000 and families under %24450,000 a year, while also extending unemployment insurance for a year and reviving an inheritance tax exemption for estates under %245 million.&#xD;
During several tense hours, with Majority Leader Eric Cantor opposing his own speaker, it appeared the House would amend the bill to include %24300 billion in spending cuts—which, if it had passed, would have required further negotiations with the Senate that probably would have run out the clock. But the leadership decided to stick with the &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; version, knowing full well that Democrats would get the ball across the finish line.&#xD;
At the same time, Obama has left some in his party disaffected as well. By raising the income threshold at which higher taxes kick in from %24250,000 to %24400,000, the president did more than back off his constantly repeated campaign vow. He gave away a huge amount of future revenue that will make it more difficult to fund the entitlement and social programs dear to Democratic hearts.&#xD;
Obama also signaled that when push comes to shove, when the final deadline is at hand, he will retreat from his line-in-the-sand position, although the White House would call it reasonable compromise that spared most people a nasty tax hike.&#xD;
Still, this was his moment of greatest political leverage. And now that the messy and embarrassing slog over the tax issue has been resolved, the playing field will be more favorable to Republicans in 2013. The administration has little left to trade now that the debate will focus on the %24110 billion in automatic spending cuts that Tuesday~’s voting delayed for two months.&#xD;
Even more troublesome, from the White House point of view, is that Republicans can again play the debt ceiling card, as they did in the summer of 2011. The threat of a government default in late February will bring enormous pressure on the president to reach an accommodation on spending cuts, just as the fiscal cliff essentially forced the Republicans to sacrifice wealthier taxpayers to avoid blame for higher levies on 98 percent of Americans.&#xD;
After the House vote, Obama served notice that he does not want to be drawn into another game of fiscal chicken over the debt ceiling. &amp;#34;While I will negotiate over many things,&amp;#34; he said, &amp;#34;I will not have another debate with this Congress over whether or not they should pay the bills that they~’ve already racked up through the laws that they passed.&amp;#34;&#xD;
That, at least, is his stated position. But it is hard to imagine the Democrats sticking to that stance if the government~’s ability to borrow is on the line. The political approach of blaming the GOP for a default might be tempting, but Obama would share responsibility for a credit downgrade that could rattle the markets and likely push the country into recession.&#xD;
The threat of a government default in late February will bring enormous pressure on the president to reach an accommodation on spending cuts.&#xD;
Of course, many Republicans aren~’t going to want to jump over that cliff—a real one, as opposed to the artificial crisis that Congress created this time—but the party is in such disarray at the moment that anything is possible.&#xD;
The White House wasn~’t shy about declaring victory after the Senate~’s 2 a.m. vote, saying &amp;#34;the president achieved a bipartisan solution that keeps income taxes low for the middle class and grows the economy,&amp;#34; while also providing &amp;#34;significant new revenue&amp;#34;—about %2460 billion for this year.&#xD;
But since the coming weeks and perhaps months will now be devoted to the next round of the budget battle, another problem for the president is that this could encroach on his second-term agenda.&#xD;
Strong Congressional support for fusion research&#xD;

In the 1990s, Congress maintained its support of the goals of the fusion program &#xD;
AND&#xD;

Even after the FY1996 changes, expressions of support continued. In the FY2000 DOE appropriations report, the House Committee on Appropriations stated, The Committee remains committed to a fusion program that is based on ... the ultimate goal of practical fusion energy.15&#xD;
During the 42-year span that witnessed substantial changes in budget levels, congressional support for a federally funded fusion energy R%26D effort and for its goal appears to have remained high. Over that period, Congress has noted also other benefits of the program such as advances in plasma science and engineering and the production of many highly trained scientists and engineers.&#xD;
Energy focus outweighs budget concerns&#xD;

6. Federal budget constraints.&#xD;
Throughout the past 42 years, Congress has on a number of occasions stated that &#xD;
AND&#xD;
the focus on energy issues appears to have overcome concerns about budget limitations.&#xD;
The situation begin to change in the early 1980s, as energy receded as a &#xD;
AND&#xD;
expressed approval of the steps DOE had taken in reorienting the program.53&#xD;
While concerns about federal spending have existed throughout most of this period, Congress has not often invoked those concerns in dealing with the program~’s budget request. It seems clear that while fiscal constraints are an important consideration for Congress, other issues, such as the nation~’s energy problems, may override those constraints to some degree.&#xD;

&#xD;
This is mind-boggling, on the first anniversary of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, with the chair of the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission warning that lessons from Fukushima have not been implemented in this country. Nevertheless, Democrats and Republicans agree on one thing: they~’re going to force nuclear power on the public, despite the astronomically high risks, both financial and environmental.&#xD;
One year ago, on 11 March 2011, the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami hit the northeast coast of Japan, causing more than 15,000 deaths, with 3,000 more missing and thousands of injuries. Japan is still reeling from the devastation – environmentally, economically, socially and politically. Naoto Kan, Japan~’s prime minister at the time, said last July;&#xD;
&amp;#34;We will aim to bring about a society that can exist without nuclear power.&amp;#34;&#xD;
He resigned in August after shutting down production at several power plants. He said that another catastrophe could force the mass evacuation of Tokyo, and even threaten &amp;#34;Japan~’s very existence&amp;#34;. Only two of the 54 Japanese power plants that were online at the time of the Fukushima disaster are currently producing power. Kan~’s successor, Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda, supports nuclear power, but faces growing public opposition to it.&#xD;
This stands in stark contrast to the United States. Just about a year before Fukushima, President Obama announced %248bn in loan guarantees to the Southern Company, the largest energy producer in the southeastern US, for the construction of two new nuclear power plants in Waynesboro, Georgia, at the Vogtle power plant, on the South Carolina border.&#xD;
Since the 1979 nuclear accident at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania, and then the catastrophe at Chernobyl in 1986, there have been no new nuclear power plants built in the US. The 104 existing nuclear plants are all increasing in age, many nearing their originally slated life expectancy of 40 years.&#xD;
While campaigning for president in 2008, Barack Obama promised that nuclear power would remain &#xD;

But at 65, after a humbling spiral — from almost-president to Democratic scapegoat to campaign pariah (2006) to wannabe secretary of state (passed over for Hillary Rodham Clinton) — Massachusetts~’ new senior senator has settled into an influential role as legislative bridge builder, international troubleshooter and party elder statesman.&#xD;

====Fusion~’s the litmus test of U.S. energy leadership====&#xD;
**Prager 11** (Stewart, Director – Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory and Professor of Astrophysical Sciences –  Princeton University, &amp;#34;How Seawater Can Power the World&amp;#34;, New York Times, 7-10, http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/11/opinion/11Prager.html?_r=1%26ref=opinion)&#xD;
&#xD;
DEBATE about America~’s energy supply is heating up: gas prices are rising, ethanol is under attack and nuclear power continues to struggle in the shadow of the Fukushima disaster in Japan.&#xD;
But an abundant, safe and clean energy source once thought to be the stuff of science fiction is closer than many realize: nuclear fusion. Making it a reality, however, will take significant investment from the government at a time when spending on scientific research is under threat.&#xD;
Harnessing nuclear fusion, the energy that powers the sun and the stars, has been a goal of physicists worldwide since the 1950s. It is essentially inexhaustible and it can be created using hydrogen isotopes — chemical cousins of hydrogen, like deuterium — that can readily be extracted from seawater.&#xD;
Fusion energy is created by fusing two atomic nuclei, in the process converting mass to energy, which appears as heat. The heat, as in conventional nuclear fission reactors, turns water into steam, which drives turbines to generate electricity, or is used to produce fuels for transportation or other uses.&#xD;
Fusion energy generates zero greenhouse gases. It offers no chance of a catastrophic accident. It can be available to all nations, relying only on the Earth~’s oceans. When commercialized, it will transform the world~’s energy supply.&#xD;
There~’s a catch. The development of fusion energy is one of the most difficult science and engineering challenges ever undertaken. Among other challenges, it requires production and confinement of a hot gas — a plasma — with a temperature around 100 million degrees Celsius.&#xD;
But potential solutions to these daunting technical challenges are emerging. In one approach, &#xD;
AND&#xD;
combustion engine, with multiple mini-explosions (about five per second).&#xD;
Once a poorly understood area of research, plasma physics has become highly developed. Scientists not only produce 100 million-degree plasmas routinely, but they control and manipulate such &amp;#34;small suns&amp;#34; with remarkable finesse. Since 1970 the power produced by magnetic fusion in the lab has grown from one-tenth of a watt, produced for a fraction of a second, to 16 million watts produced for one second — a billionfold increase in fusion energy.&#xD;
Seven partners — the European Union, China, India, Japan, Russia, South Korea and the United States — have teamed up on an experiment to produce 500 million watts of fusion power for 500 seconds and longer by 2020, demonstrating key scientific and engineering aspects of fusion at the scale of a reactor.&#xD;
However, even though the United States is a contributor to this experiment, known as ITER, it has yet to commit to the full program needed to develop a domestic fusion reactor to produce electricity for the American power grid. Meanwhile other nations are moving forward to implement fusion as a key ingredient of their energy security.&#xD;
Indeed, fusion research facilities more modern than anything in the United States are either under construction or operating in China, Germany, Japan and South Korea. The will and enthusiasm of governments in Asia to fill their energy needs with fusion, as soon as possible, is nearly palpable.&#xD;
What has been lacking in the United States is the political and economic will. We need serious public investment to develop materials that can withstand the harsh fusion environment, sustain hot plasma indefinitely and integrate all these features in an experimental facility to produce continuous fusion power.&#xD;
This won~’t be cheap. A rough estimate is that it would take %2430 billion and 20 years to go from the current state of research to the first working fusion reactor. But put in perspective, that sum is equal to about a week of domestic energy consumption, or about 2 percent of the annual energy expenditure of %241.5 trillion.&#xD;
Fusion used to be an energy source for my generation~’s grandchildren; now, plans &#xD;
AND&#xD;
that will shape our future. Scientists and engineers stand ready to help.&#xD;

Given the totemic importance of the federal R%26D budget, and the centrality of the budget in S%26T policy discourse, what can we learn about the U.S. science and technology enterprise from an examination of budgetary trends? The first thing to be said is that it depends on which trends one chooses to examine.&#xD;

The need for fusion could not be more pronounced than today: the world is &#xD;
AND&#xD;
and lessen our impact on the world, will require new energy sources.&#xD;
Fusion is coming into it~’s own today.  It is the best of all possible &#xD;
AND&#xD;
in demand throughout the world with a non carbon-producing energy source.&#xD;

&#xD;
The world we face in 2012 is of a different character than even a few years ago. Many developing nations are fragile states and are under enormous pressure from terrorism, endemic poverty, environmental challenges, debt, corruption, civil unrest, and regional, tribal, and religious conflicts. The result is a climate of despair, and potential breeding grounds for radical politics and extremism.&#xD;
A successful American foreign policy must include thinking through actions and policies, and how &#xD;
AND&#xD;
years. Too often we tend to confuse tactical action for strategic thinking. &#xD;
A matter of mutual understanding&#xD;
American foreign policy has always required a principled realism that is true to our values as we face the world as it really is in all of its complexities. We need to accept the reality that there is not a short-term solution to every problem in the world. What we must do is manage these realities and complex problems, moving them into positions of solution possibilities and resolution.&#xD;
American foreign policy has always dared to project a vision of a world where all &#xD;
AND&#xD;
little margin for error with the stakes so high in the world today.&#xD;
America must strengthen its global alliances. Common-interest alliances will be required in &#xD;
AND&#xD;
economic, intelligence, diplomatic, humanitarian, military and law enforcement fields.&#xD;
The centrality of alliances and multi-lateral institutions to a successful foreign policy is fundamental. Alliances and multi-lateral institutions must be understood as expansions of our influence, not as constraints on our power.  Alliances are imperfect, as are all institutions. But like &amp;#34;process,&amp;#34; they help absorb shocks.&#xD;
Beyond military solutions&#xD;
Alliances must be built on solid foundations to handle both routine and sudden unforeseen challenges. Crisis-driven &amp;#34;coalitions of the willing&amp;#34; by themselves are not the building blocks for a stable world. We need to think more broadly, deeply and strategically.&#xD;
American military power and force structure cannot sustain its commitments without a shift to a more comprehensive strategic approach to global threats and a more flexible and agile military. Cyber warfare is a paramount example of these new threats.&#xD;
The perception of American power around the world must not rest solely on a military orientation or optic. There must be an underlying commitment to engagement and humanity. Engagement is not appeasement, nor is it negotiation. It is not a guarantee of anything, but rather a smart diplomatic bridge to better understanding and possible conflict resolution.&#xD;
American foreign policy must reflect the realities and demands of the global economy. The &#xD;
AND&#xD;
strength must be as high a priority as any other foreign policy priority.&#xD;
America~’s security and growth are connected to both the American and global economies. A centerpiece of this security is energy security. Energy security and energy interdependence are interconnected parts of a broad and deep foreign policy paradigm that frames the complexity of the challenges that face America and the world.&#xD;

===Adv 2 - spinoffs===&#xD;
&#xD;
====Fusion research generates spin-off technologies —- budget cuts make this impossible====&#xD;
**Cunningham 12** (Nicholas, Policy Analyst for Energy and Climate – American Security Project, &amp;#34;The Future of Fusion&amp;#34;, American Security Project Blog, 6-5, http://americansecurityproject.org/blog/2012/the-future-of-fusion/)&#xD;
&#xD;
Fourth, a robust fusion industry would have important spillover effects that previous technological breakthroughs experienced. Just as discoveries and innovations in the space industry led to GPS technology and cell phones, advancements in the fusion industry would create new business applications.&#xD;
Fusion energy holds great promise, and the scientific community is &amp;#34;united&amp;#34; in the belief that its commercialization is possible. But, several challenges remain.&#xD;
The first problem is scientific. More research and development is needed for the technology to mature, and serious hurdles have to be passed before it is ready for commercial application.&#xD;
The second problem is more immediate. The industry is under threat from budget cuts from Congress, which could derail ongoing research, dismantle the workforce, and push a date for first ~’burning plasma~’ further off into the future. Fusion cuts could spell the end for America~’s lead in this industry, as China, South Korea and Japan increase their investments in fusion technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
====Overall funding increase~’s key====&#xD;
**Holland 12** – Andrew, Senior Fellow for Energy and Climate – American Security Project, &amp;#34;A Tough Budget for Fusion&amp;#34;, American Security Project Blog, 3-1, http://americansecurityproject.org/blog/2012/the-budget-for-fusion/&#xD;
&#xD;
The cut in the domestic fusion program would have a devastating impact on U.S. fusion research. It would  shut down the Alcator C-Mod at MIT, one of the three facilities critical to continued U.S. leadership in fusion.&#xD;
The truth is, that after years of operating on minimal budgets and essentially level funding, the domestic fusion program cannot absorb the proposed reductions without significant negative impacts to the program and our scientific and engineering contributions.&#xD;
It is very important that this budget is changed, not only to save this &#xD;
AND&#xD;
, www.fusionfuture.org that details the importance of this budget.&#xD;
They have also put together an excellent graph on the future of the fusion budget: as you can see on the graph that the MIT student put together (at left), the purple part is the U.S. budget commitment to ITER, which will crowd out over 3/4 of the total budget.&#xD;
ASP believes that the fusion budget should be increased significantly, up to the point &#xD;
AND&#xD;
be able to capitalize on the advancements in fusion science that will come.&#xD;
&#xD;
====Happens immediately, even if sustained fusion is far off====&#xD;
**Silverstein 12** (Ken, Editor of Energy Central and Contributor – Forbes, &amp;#34;The Tantalizing Promise And Peril Of Nuclear Fusion&amp;#34;, Forbes Magazine, 4-15, http://www.forbes.com/sites/kensilverstein/2012/04/15/nuclears-strongest-potential-weapon-fusion/)&#xD;
&#xD;
&amp;#34;Despite fusion~’s tantalizing benefits, it has been largely ignored in energy policy discussions because it is viewed as a technology too immature to affect energy production over the next few decades, when it is most needed,&amp;#34; says the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The lab, which is part of a %243.5 billion research effort to help commercialize fusion, says that the United States is in a &amp;#34;unique position to change this paradigm.&amp;#34;&#xD;
To be clear, fusion is different from fission, which is how today~’s nuclear reactor~’s produce energy. Fission splits atoms apart whereas fusion combines them — a process that thus far consumes more energy than it generates. The aim, though, is to heat the hydrogen gas to more than 100 million degrees Celsius so that the atoms will bond instead of bounce off each another.&#xD;
If scientists are ultimately able to achieve success, the end result would be the production of 10 million times more power than a typical chemical reaction, such as the burning of fossil fuels. And it would occur without the carbon emissions or the disposal of high-level radioactive waste.&#xD;
To that end, an international consortium has already spent %2420 billion on fusion &#xD;
AND&#xD;
the scientific and engineering skills needed to bring such a concept to scale.&#xD;
What immediate benefits do those participants get from funding ITER, or from making their own national investments in nuclear fusion? Magnet technology is one area, which is used in medical devices such as magnetic resonance imagery that allows doctor~’s see completely inside the human brain.&#xD;
That~’s what Michael Claessens, head of communications for ITER Organization, explained to this reporter in an email. Superconducting and advanced materials are two additional benefits, he notes, adding that more such bonuses will occur in the future, as it does with any high-level research.&#xD;

We face a severe potential emergency. External threats serve to unite. The world faces an unrecognized nuclear peril%21 Uniting to confront it can generate the missing popular and government support to generate millions of jobs and revitalize the global economy.&#xD;
A THREAT GREATER THAN ANY TERROR ATTACK%21&#xD;
A NASA funded study by the National Academy of Sciences was titled Severe Space Weather Events—Understanding Societal and Economic Impacts. The resulting Report detailed what might happen in the event of a solar megastorm launching a powerful Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) that strikes our geomagnetic field. The study predicts blackouts that may last for years. As the map above indicates, highly vulnerable areas include most of the Eastern and Northwestern parts of the nation.&#xD;
The NOAA estimates each 11 year sunspot cycle is capable of launching 4 &amp;#34;extreme&amp;#34; (X class) CMEs and 100 &amp;#34;severe&amp;#34; CMEs at the earth. More X class events than were anticipated have occurred in the current cycle. The most dangerous period is the next 5 years. The peak peril is predicted by some to occur in May, 2013.&#xD;
So far, neither NASA nor NOAA have publicly acknowledged the mortal threat these events may cause as the result of multiple meltdowns of nuclear plants worldwide. To date, there is no indication that the White House, Congress, Homeland Security, the Department of Defense and/or the Nuclear Regulatory Commission have adequately prepared to prevent the horrendous effects of such a solar megastorm.&#xD;
The recent statement by a NASA scientist that human life would not end as the &#xD;
AND&#xD;
specific year. This entire 11 year sunspot cycle should be of concern.&#xD;

====Alcator C-Mod will close without federal fusion funding – DOE~’s key to reverse the shutdown order====&#xD;
**Lin 9-7**-12&#xD;
(Leon, writer for The Tech at MIT, &amp;#34;Alcator C-Mod may lose funds,&amp;#34; http://tech.mit.edu/V132/N35/alcator.html-http://tech.mit.edu/V132/N35/alcator.html)&#xD;
&#xD;
President Obama~’s budget request to Congress for fiscal year (FY) 2013, announced in February, proposed to shut down MIT~’s federally-funded Alcator C-Mod, a tokamak (toroidal magnetic confinement device). To give itself six more months to agree on a formal appropriations bill, Congress will pass a continuing resolution this month. The resolution will likely sustain funding for Alcator C-Mod at current levels until the final budget for FY 2013 is out. If the final budget passed by Congress is in line with the president~’s request, technical, engineering, and administrative staff would be laid off, and some 30 PhD students in Nuclear Science %26 Engineering (Course 22) would be forced to graduate by October 2013. The Department of Energy (DOE) has ordered Alcator C-Mod not to operate in the interim. However, researchers at the tokamak will not begin dismantling the device just yet, in case Congress decides to resume funding for research at Alcator C-Mod, which aims to develop a source of clean energy from nuclear fusion power. &amp;#34;Our best information at this point indicates that C-Mod will be put into a ~’ready standby,~’&amp;#34; says Zach S. Hartwig, a Course 22 PhD student, who believes and hopes that there will be no layoffs. &amp;#34;We are essentially buckling down until the next continuing resolution, due in February or March of 2013, or approved FY13 budget, under which we hope to receive funding to resume full experimental operations.&amp;#34; In June, 12 MIT PhD students, including Hartwig, and an undergraduate from the University of Texas at Austin visited Congress, meeting with almost 30 congressional offices. &amp;#34;Our goal was to educate congressional offices on the situation and ask for support for domestic fusion in the upcoming continuing resolution,&amp;#34; says Hartwig. The only three tokamaks in operation in the United States are Alcator C-Mod, DIII-D at General Atomics, and NSTX at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory. The presidential FY 2013 budget would cut money out of all three to support ITER (International Thermonuclear Expansion Reactor), an international project to build the biggest and best tokamak fusion reactor yet. Of the three, Alcator C-Mod has received the smallest share of the DOE~’s fusion energy funding. Alcator C-Mod is also the only one that would be completely shut down under the presidential budget request. The budget request allocates about %24150 million to ITER contributions (up nearly %2450 million from FY 2012) and about %24250 million to domestic programs, maintaining the total of about %24400 million that has gone to fusion energy sciences in the past few years. The Senate Energy and Water Subcommittee has proposed legislation with similar numbers. The House Energy and Water Subcommittee, however, has proposed a bill that would supply about %24300 million to the domestic fusion energy program and about %24180 million to ITER. According to Hartwig, &amp;#34;%24300 million is a widely agreed upon ~’minimum funding~’ level required to maintain a robust, successful domestic program.&amp;#34; Does the U.S. need three tokamaks? The heads of DIII-D, Alcator C-Mod, and NSTX told Nature for the journal~’s July article that all three sites contribute uniquely to science and preliminary research for ITER. They have also argued that a strong domestic fusion energy presence will be necessary to benefit from ITER results. &amp;#34;We must be training the next generation of fusion scientists and engineers, which requires domestic facilities to train them on, as well as maintaining our scientific lead as one of the great fusion powerhouses of the world, which requires our unique domestic facilities to perform the research, if we hope to be ~’building~’ fusion power plants in the future rather than ~’buying~’ them from China or Europe. Sacrificing the domestic program for ITER makes no sense,&amp;#34; says Hartwig. The ITER budget has nearly quintupled since the U.S. became an ITER partner, said Hartwig, and at the time the DOE and &amp;#34;the U.S. fusion community&amp;#34; agreed that funds would not be siphoned from domestic programs to support ITER. Alcator C-Mod is the single largest experiment at MIT, according to http://fusionfuture.org, which was started by graduate students to campaign against funding cuts. According to Hartwig, it~’s the largest in terms of both of funding and number of people employed. Alcator C-Mod supports about 120 people directly, including scientists, professors, students, and technical staff. The grant money also supports the equivalent of about 100 MIT staff and another 80 full-time jobs from subcontracting. Supporters of the domestic fusion program foresee serious consequences if Congress decides to wind down Alcator C-Mod in FY 2013. Hartwig worries that MIT~’s plasma physics group will disappear. Hartwig also echoes fusionfuture.org~’s warning that &amp;#34;without an increase in funding, the domestic fusion program will be effectively eliminated to pay for ITER.&amp;#34;&#xD;

&#xD;
We must prevent these new highly dangerous and destructive nuclear weapons from being developed. The time to do so is now, before their feasibility is established. Once feasibility is demonstrated, the pressures from nuclear weapons laboratories as well as the military establishment to design and build them will be immense. We have one advantage over the time when fission-triggered thermonuclear weapons were developed in the 1950s. We have a CTBT that bans all nuclear explosions.&#xD;
Besides the nuclear dangers that pure fusion weapons would pose, there is an immediate &#xD;

As my colleague Hisham Zerriffi will explain, the negotiating record regarding fission explosions as &#xD;
AND&#xD;

No country has actually announced the goal of building pure fusion weapons. Given the insistent international calls for nuclear disarmament and the requirement of the thirty-year-old Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) that nuclear powers end the nuclear arms race at an &amp;#34;early date,&amp;#34; those powers could hardly announce an explicit goal for developing pure fusion weapons.&#xD;

===Adv 1 – fusion leadership===&#xD;
&#xD;
====Fusion~’s the litmus test of U.S. energy leadership====&#xD;
**Prager 11** (Stewart, Director – Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory and Professor of Astrophysical Sciences –  Princeton University, &amp;#34;How Seawater Can Power the World&amp;#34;, New York Times, 7-10, http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/11/opinion/11Prager.html?_r=1%26ref=opinion)&#xD;
&#xD;
DEBATE about America~’s energy supply is heating up: gas prices are rising, ethanol is under attack and nuclear power continues to struggle in the shadow of the Fukushima disaster in Japan.&#xD;
But an abundant, safe and clean energy source once thought to be the stuff of science fiction is closer than many realize: nuclear fusion. Making it a reality, however, will take significant investment from the government at a time when spending on scientific research is under threat.&#xD;
Harnessing nuclear fusion, the energy that powers the sun and the stars, has been a goal of physicists worldwide since the 1950s. It is essentially inexhaustible and it can be created using hydrogen isotopes — chemical cousins of hydrogen, like deuterium — that can readily be extracted from seawater.&#xD;
Fusion energy is created by fusing two atomic nuclei, in the process converting mass to energy, which appears as heat. The heat, as in conventional nuclear fission reactors, turns water into steam, which drives turbines to generate electricity, or is used to produce fuels for transportation or other uses.&#xD;
Fusion energy generates zero greenhouse gases. It offers no chance of a catastrophic accident. It can be available to all nations, relying only on the Earth~’s oceans. When commercialized, it will transform the world~’s energy supply.&#xD;
There~’s a catch. The development of fusion energy is one of the most difficult science and engineering challenges ever undertaken. Among other challenges, it requires production and confinement of a hot gas — a plasma — with a temperature around 100 million degrees Celsius.&#xD;
But potential solutions to these daunting technical challenges are emerging. In one approach, &#xD;
AND&#xD;
combustion engine, with multiple mini-explosions (about five per second).&#xD;
Once a poorly understood area of research, plasma physics has become highly developed. Scientists not only produce 100 million-degree plasmas routinely, but they control and manipulate such &amp;#34;small suns&amp;#34; with remarkable finesse. Since 1970 the power produced by magnetic fusion in the lab has grown from one-tenth of a watt, produced for a fraction of a second, to 16 million watts produced for one second — a billionfold increase in fusion energy.&#xD;
Seven partners — the European Union, China, India, Japan, Russia, South Korea and the United States — have teamed up on an experiment to produce 500 million watts of fusion power for 500 seconds and longer by 2020, demonstrating key scientific and engineering aspects of fusion at the scale of a reactor.&#xD;
However, even though the United States is a contributor to this experiment, known as ITER, it has yet to commit to the full program needed to develop a domestic fusion reactor to produce electricity for the American power grid. Meanwhile other nations are moving forward to implement fusion as a key ingredient of their energy security.&#xD;
Indeed, fusion research facilities more modern than anything in the United States are either under construction or operating in China, Germany, Japan and South Korea. The will and enthusiasm of governments in Asia to fill their energy needs with fusion, as soon as possible, is nearly palpable.&#xD;
What has been lacking in the United States is the political and economic will. We need serious public investment to develop materials that can withstand the harsh fusion environment, sustain hot plasma indefinitely and integrate all these features in an experimental facility to produce continuous fusion power.&#xD;
This won~’t be cheap. A rough estimate is that it would take %2430 billion and 20 years to go from the current state of research to the first working fusion reactor. But put in perspective, that sum is equal to about a week of domestic energy consumption, or about 2 percent of the annual energy expenditure of %241.5 trillion.&#xD;
Fusion used to be an energy source for my generation~’s grandchildren; now, plans &#xD;
AND&#xD;
that will shape our future. Scientists and engineers stand ready to help.&#xD;

The world we face in 2012 is of a different character than even a few years ago. Many developing nations are fragile states and are under enormous pressure from terrorism, endemic poverty, environmental challenges, debt, corruption, civil unrest, and regional, tribal, and religious conflicts. The result is a climate of despair, and potential breeding grounds for radical politics and extremism.&#xD;
A successful American foreign policy must include thinking through actions and policies, and how &#xD;
AND&#xD;
years. Too often we tend to confuse tactical action for strategic thinking. &#xD;
A matter of mutual understanding&#xD;
American foreign policy has always required a principled realism that is true to our values as we face the world as it really is in all of its complexities. We need to accept the reality that there is not a short-term solution to every problem in the world. What we must do is manage these realities and complex problems, moving them into positions of solution possibilities and resolution.&#xD;
American foreign policy has always dared to project a vision of a world where all &#xD;
AND&#xD;
little margin for error with the stakes so high in the world today.&#xD;
America must strengthen its global alliances. Common-interest alliances will be required in &#xD;
AND&#xD;
economic, intelligence, diplomatic, humanitarian, military and law enforcement fields.&#xD;
The centrality of alliances and multi-lateral institutions to a successful foreign policy is fundamental. Alliances and multi-lateral institutions must be understood as expansions of our influence, not as constraints on our power.  Alliances are imperfect, as are all institutions. But like &amp;#34;process,&amp;#34; they help absorb shocks.&#xD;
Beyond military solutions&#xD;
Alliances must be built on solid foundations to handle both routine and sudden unforeseen challenges. Crisis-driven &amp;#34;coalitions of the willing&amp;#34; by themselves are not the building blocks for a stable world. We need to think more broadly, deeply and strategically.&#xD;
American military power and force structure cannot sustain its commitments without a shift to a more comprehensive strategic approach to global threats and a more flexible and agile military. Cyber warfare is a paramount example of these new threats.&#xD;
The perception of American power around the world must not rest solely on a military orientation or optic. There must be an underlying commitment to engagement and humanity. Engagement is not appeasement, nor is it negotiation. It is not a guarantee of anything, but rather a smart diplomatic bridge to better understanding and possible conflict resolution.&#xD;
American foreign policy must reflect the realities and demands of the global economy. The &#xD;
AND&#xD;
strength must be as high a priority as any other foreign policy priority.&#xD;
America~’s security and growth are connected to both the American and global economies. A centerpiece of this security is energy security. Energy security and energy interdependence are interconnected parts of a broad and deep foreign policy paradigm that frames the complexity of the challenges that face America and the world.&#xD;

====Alcator C-Mod will close without federal fusion funding – DOE~’s key to reverse the shutdown order====&#xD;
**Lin 9-7**-12&#xD;
(Leon, writer for The Tech at MIT, &amp;#34;Alcator C-Mod may lose funds,&amp;#34; http://tech.mit.edu/V132/N35/alcator.html-http://tech.mit.edu/V132/N35/alcator.html)&#xD;
&#xD;
President Obama~’s budget request to Congress for fiscal year (FY) 2013, announced in February, proposed to shut down MIT~’s federally-funded Alcator C-Mod, a tokamak (toroidal magnetic confinement device). To give itself six more months to agree on a formal appropriations bill, Congress will pass a continuing resolution this month. The resolution will likely sustain funding for Alcator C-Mod at current levels until the final budget for FY 2013 is out. If the final budget passed by Congress is in line with the president~’s request, technical, engineering, and administrative staff would be laid off, and some 30 PhD students in Nuclear Science %26 Engineering (Course 22) would be forced to graduate by October 2013. The Department of Energy (DOE) has ordered Alcator C-Mod not to operate in the interim. However, researchers at the tokamak will not begin dismantling the device just yet, in case Congress decides to resume funding for research at Alcator C-Mod, which aims to develop a source of clean energy from nuclear fusion power. &amp;#34;Our best information at this point indicates that C-Mod will be put into a ~’ready standby,~’&amp;#34; says Zach S. Hartwig, a Course 22 PhD student, who believes and hopes that there will be no layoffs. &amp;#34;We are essentially buckling down until the next continuing resolution, due in February or March of 2013, or approved FY13 budget, under which we hope to receive funding to resume full experimental operations.&amp;#34; In June, 12 MIT PhD students, including Hartwig, and an undergraduate from the University of Texas at Austin visited Congress, meeting with almost 30 congressional offices. &amp;#34;Our goal was to educate congressional offices on the situation and ask for support for domestic fusion in the upcoming continuing resolution,&amp;#34; says Hartwig. The only three tokamaks in operation in the United States are Alcator C-Mod, DIII-D at General Atomics, and NSTX at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory. The presidential FY 2013 budget would cut money out of all three to support ITER (International Thermonuclear Expansion Reactor), an international project to build the biggest and best tokamak fusion reactor yet. Of the three, Alcator C-Mod has received the smallest share of the DOE~’s fusion energy funding. Alcator C-Mod is also the only one that would be completely shut down under the presidential budget request. The budget request allocates about %24150 million to ITER contributions (up nearly %2450 million from FY 2012) and about %24250 million to domestic programs, maintaining the total of about %24400 million that has gone to fusion energy sciences in the past few years. The Senate Energy and Water Subcommittee has proposed legislation with similar numbers. The House Energy and Water Subcommittee, however, has proposed a bill that would supply about %24300 million to the domestic fusion energy program and about %24180 million to ITER. According to Hartwig, &amp;#34;%24300 million is a widely agreed upon ~’minimum funding~’ level required to maintain a robust, successful domestic program.&amp;#34; Does the U.S. need three tokamaks? The heads of DIII-D, Alcator C-Mod, and NSTX told Nature for the journal~’s July article that all three sites contribute uniquely to science and preliminary research for ITER. They have also argued that a strong domestic fusion energy presence will be necessary to benefit from ITER results. &amp;#34;We must be training the next generation of fusion scientists and engineers, which requires domestic facilities to train them on, as well as maintaining our scientific lead as one of the great fusion powerhouses of the world, which requires our unique domestic facilities to perform the research, if we hope to be ~’building~’ fusion power plants in the future rather than ~’buying~’ them from China or Europe. Sacrificing the domestic program for ITER makes no sense,&amp;#34; says Hartwig. The ITER budget has nearly quintupled since the U.S. became an ITER partner, said Hartwig, and at the time the DOE and &amp;#34;the U.S. fusion community&amp;#34; agreed that funds would not be siphoned from domestic programs to support ITER. Alcator C-Mod is the single largest experiment at MIT, according to http://fusionfuture.org, which was started by graduate students to campaign against funding cuts. According to Hartwig, it~’s the largest in terms of both of funding and number of people employed. Alcator C-Mod supports about 120 people directly, including scientists, professors, students, and technical staff. The grant money also supports the equivalent of about 100 MIT staff and another 80 full-time jobs from subcontracting. Supporters of the domestic fusion program foresee serious consequences if Congress decides to wind down Alcator C-Mod in FY 2013. Hartwig worries that MIT~’s plasma physics group will disappear. Hartwig also echoes fusionfuture.org~’s warning that &amp;#34;without an increase in funding, the domestic fusion program will be effectively eliminated to pay for ITER.&amp;#34;&#xD;

&#xD;
We must prevent these new highly dangerous and destructive nuclear weapons from being developed. The time to do so is now, before their feasibility is established. Once feasibility is demonstrated, the pressures from nuclear weapons laboratories as well as the military establishment to design and build them will be immense. We have one advantage over the time when fission-triggered thermonuclear weapons were developed in the 1950s. We have a CTBT that bans all nuclear explosions.&#xD;
Besides the nuclear dangers that pure fusion weapons would pose, there is an immediate &#xD;

As my colleague Hisham Zerriffi will explain, the negotiating record regarding fission explosions as &#xD;
AND&#xD;

Given the insistent international calls for nuclear disarmament and the requirement of the thirty-year-old Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) that nuclear powers end the nuclear arms race at an &amp;#34;early date,&amp;#34; those powers could hardly announce an explicit goal for developing pure fusion weapons.&#xD;

&#xD;
Fourth, a robust fusion industry would have important spillover effects that previous technological breakthroughs experienced. Just as discoveries and innovations in the space industry led to GPS technology and cell phones, advancements in the fusion industry would create new business applications.&#xD;
Fusion energy holds great promise, and the scientific community is &amp;#34;united&amp;#34; in the belief that its commercialization is possible. But, several challenges remain.&#xD;
The first problem is scientific. More research and development is needed for the technology to mature, and serious hurdles have to be passed before it is ready for commercial application.&#xD;
The second problem is more immediate. The industry is under threat from budget cuts from Congress, which could derail ongoing research, dismantle the workforce, and push a date for first ~’burning plasma~’ further off into the future. Fusion cuts could spell the end for America~’s lead in this industry, as China, South Korea and Japan increase their investments in fusion technology.&#xD;

&#xD;
The cut in the domestic fusion program would have a devastating impact on U.S. fusion research. It would  shut down the Alcator C-Mod at MIT, one of the three facilities critical to continued U.S. leadership in fusion.&#xD;
The truth is, that after years of operating on minimal budgets and essentially level funding, the domestic fusion program cannot absorb the proposed reductions without significant negative impacts to the program and our scientific and engineering contributions.&#xD;
It is very important that this budget is changed, not only to save this &#xD;

The lab, which is part of a %243.5 billion research effort to help commercialize fusion, says that the United States is in a &amp;#34;unique position to change this paradigm.&amp;#34;&#xD;
To be clear, fusion is different from fission, which is how today~’s nuclear reactor~’s produce energy. Fission splits atoms apart whereas fusion combines them — a process that thus far consumes more energy than it generates. The aim, though, is to heat the hydrogen gas to more than 100 million degrees Celsius so that the atoms will bond instead of bounce off each another.&#xD;
If scientists are ultimately able to achieve success, the end result would be the production of 10 million times more power than a typical chemical reaction, such as the burning of fossil fuels. And it would occur without the carbon emissions or the disposal of high-level radioactive waste.&#xD;
To that end, an international consortium has already spent %2420 billion on fusion &#xD;
AND&#xD;
the scientific and engineering skills needed to bring such a concept to scale.&#xD;
What immediate benefits do those participants get from funding ITER, or from making their own national investments in nuclear fusion? Magnet technology is one area, which is used in medical devices such as magnetic resonance imagery that allows doctor~’s see completely inside the human brain.&#xD;
That~’s what Michael Claessens, head of communications for ITER Organization, explained to this reporter in an email. Superconducting and advanced materials are two additional benefits, he notes, adding that more such bonuses will occur in the future, as it does with any high-level research.&#xD;

This report presents ERS research on the interaction between food safety and international trade. Food safety challenges are mounting and crises like &amp;#34;mad cow disease&amp;#34; are becoming more pronounced. Growth in world food trade means that U.S. consumers are more dependent on the food safety measures used in other countries and that there are greater opportunities for U.S. food exports.&#xD;
This research was performed by examining the conceptual relationships between food safety and international trade and by examining the meat and poultry, produce, food/animal feed crop, and seafood sectors for trends in trade, food safety regulation, and the resolution of incidents and disputes related to both.&#xD;

     While fission is a very dangerous and difficult process which can cause catastrophic meltdowns like Chernobyl, fusion is a relatively simple process, which can be easily monitored and controlled ~~9~~. For these reasons nuclear fusion is much more desirable as a global power source than nuclear fission
Inertial Confinement Fusion
Inertial confinement nuclear fusion is a specific type of nuclear fusion. It, just

     Theoretically inertial confinement nuclear fusion could produce an enormous amount of &amp;#34;green&amp;#34;

===Plan===

====The United States Federal Government should substantially increase grants for magnetic fusion energy generation in the United States.====

===Contention 1 —- Leadership===

====Fusion~’s the litmus test of U.S. energy leadership====
**Prager 11** (Stewart, Director – Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory and Professor of Astrophysical Sciences –  Princeton University, &amp;#34;How Seawater Can Power the World&amp;#34;, New York Times, 7-10, http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/11/opinion/11Prager.html?_r=1%26ref=opinion)

DEBATE about America~’s energy supply is heating up: gas prices are rising, ethanol is under attack and nuclear power continues to struggle in the shadow of the Fukushima disaster in Japan.
But an abundant, safe and clean energy source once thought to be the stuff of science fiction is closer than many realize: nuclear fusion. Making it a reality, however, will take significant investment from the government at a time when spending on scientific research is under threat.
Harnessing nuclear fusion, the energy that powers the sun and the stars, has been a goal of physicists worldwide since the 1950s. It is essentially inexhaustible and it can be created using hydrogen isotopes — chemical cousins of hydrogen, like deuterium — that can readily be extracted from seawater.
Fusion energy is created by fusing two atomic nuclei, in the process converting mass to energy, which appears as heat. The heat, as in conventional nuclear fission reactors, turns water into steam, which drives turbines to generate electricity, or is used to produce fuels for transportation or other uses.
Fusion energy generates zero greenhouse gases. It offers no chance of a catastrophic accident. It can be available to all nations, relying only on the Earth~’s oceans. When commercialized, it will transform the world~’s energy supply.
There~’s a catch. The development of fusion energy is one of the most difficult science and engineering challenges ever undertaken. Among other challenges, it requires production and confinement of a hot gas — a plasma — with a temperature around 100 million degrees Celsius.
But potential solutions to these daunting technical challenges are emerging. In one approach, 
AND
combustion engine, with multiple mini-explosions (about five per second).
Once a poorly understood area of research, plasma physics has become highly developed. Scientists not only produce 100 million-degree plasmas routinely, but they control and manipulate such &amp;#34;small suns&amp;#34; with remarkable finesse. Since 1970 the power produced by magnetic fusion in the lab has grown from one-tenth of a watt, produced for a fraction of a second, to 16 million watts produced for one second — a billionfold increase in fusion energy.
Seven partners — the European Union, China, India, Japan, Russia, South Korea and the United States — have teamed up on an experiment to produce 500 million watts of fusion power for 500 seconds and longer by 2020, demonstrating key scientific and engineering aspects of fusion at the scale of a reactor.
However, even though the United States is a contributor to this experiment, known as ITER, it has yet to commit to the full program needed to develop a domestic fusion reactor to produce electricity for the American power grid. Meanwhile other nations are moving forward to implement fusion as a key ingredient of their energy security.
Indeed, fusion research facilities more modern than anything in the United States are either under construction or operating in China, Germany, Japan and South Korea. The will and enthusiasm of governments in Asia to fill their energy needs with fusion, as soon as possible, is nearly palpable.
What has been lacking in the United States is the political and economic will. We need serious public investment to develop materials that can withstand the harsh fusion environment, sustain hot plasma indefinitely and integrate all these features in an experimental facility to produce continuous fusion power.
This won~’t be cheap. A rough estimate is that it would take %2430 billion and 20 years to go from the current state of research to the first working fusion reactor. But put in perspective, that sum is equal to about a week of domestic energy consumption, or about 2 percent of the annual energy expenditure of %241.5 trillion.
Fusion used to be an energy source for my generation~’s grandchildren; now, plans 
AND
that will shape our future. Scientists and engineers stand ready to help.

====Federal funding is the focal point====
**Sarewitz 3** (Daniel, Professor of Science and Society and Co-Director of the Consortium for Science, Policy and Outcomes – Arizona State University, &amp;#34;Does Science Policy Exist, and If So, Does it Matter?: Some Observations on the U.S. R%26D Budget&amp;#34;, Discussion Paper for Earth Institute Science, Technology, and Global Development Seminar, 4-8, http://www.cspo.org/documents/budget_seminar.pdf)

It is not only axiomatic but also true that federal science policy is largely played 
AND
public considers such changes to be surrogates for progress toward particular societal goals.
To get a feel for the depth of this worldview, consider the National Institutes 
AND
this information he inferred a &amp;#34;crisis&amp;#34; in federal support for science.
Given the totemic importance of the federal R%26D budget, and the centrality of the budget in S%26T policy discourse, what can we learn about the U.S. science and technology enterprise from an examination of budgetary trends? The first thing to be said is that it depends on which trends one chooses to examine.

The world we face in 2012 is of a different character than even a few years ago. Many developing nations are fragile states and are under enormous pressure from terrorism, endemic poverty, environmental challenges, debt, corruption, civil unrest, and regional, tribal, and religious conflicts. The result is a climate of despair, and potential breeding grounds for radical politics and extremism.
A successful American foreign policy must include thinking through actions and policies, and how 
AND
years. Too often we tend to confuse tactical action for strategic thinking. 
A matter of mutual understanding
American foreign policy has always required a principled realism that is true to our values as we face the world as it really is in all of its complexities. We need to accept the reality that there is not a short-term solution to every problem in the world. What we must do is manage these realities and complex problems, moving them into positions of solution possibilities and resolution.
American foreign policy has always dared to project a vision of a world where all 
AND
little margin for error with the stakes so high in the world today.
America must strengthen its global alliances. Common-interest alliances will be required in 
AND
economic, intelligence, diplomatic, humanitarian, military and law enforcement fields.
The centrality of alliances and multi-lateral institutions to a successful foreign policy is fundamental. Alliances and multi-lateral institutions must be understood as expansions of our influence, not as constraints on our power.  Alliances are imperfect, as are all institutions. But like &amp;#34;process,&amp;#34; they help absorb shocks.
Beyond military solutions
Alliances must be built on solid foundations to handle both routine and sudden unforeseen challenges. Crisis-driven &amp;#34;coalitions of the willing&amp;#34; by themselves are not the building blocks for a stable world. We need to think more broadly, deeply and strategically.
American military power and force structure cannot sustain its commitments without a shift to a more comprehensive strategic approach to global threats and a more flexible and agile military. Cyber warfare is a paramount example of these new threats.
The perception of American power around the world must not rest solely on a military orientation or optic. There must be an underlying commitment to engagement and humanity. Engagement is not appeasement, nor is it negotiation. It is not a guarantee of anything, but rather a smart diplomatic bridge to better understanding and possible conflict resolution.
American foreign policy must reflect the realities and demands of the global economy. The 
AND
strength must be as high a priority as any other foreign policy priority.
America~’s security and growth are connected to both the American and global economies. A centerpiece of this security is energy security. Energy security and energy interdependence are interconnected parts of a broad and deep foreign policy paradigm that frames the complexity of the challenges that face America and the world.

===Contention 2 —- Fusion===

====Fusion research generates spin-off technologies —- budget cuts make this impossible====
**Cunningham 12** (Nicholas, Policy Analyst for Energy and Climate – American Security Project, &amp;#34;The Future of Fusion&amp;#34;, American Security Project Blog, 6-5, http://americansecurityproject.org/blog/2012/the-future-of-fusion/)

Fourth, a robust fusion industry would have important spillover effects that previous technological breakthroughs experienced. Just as discoveries and innovations in the space industry led to GPS technology and cell phones, advancements in the fusion industry would create new business applications.
Fusion energy holds great promise, and the scientific community is &amp;#34;united&amp;#34; in the belief that its commercialization is possible. But, several challenges remain.
The first problem is scientific. More research and development is needed for the technology to mature, and serious hurdles have to be passed before it is ready for commercial application.
The second problem is more immediate. The industry is under threat from budget cuts from Congress, which could derail ongoing research, dismantle the workforce, and push a date for first ~’burning plasma~’ further off into the future. Fusion cuts could spell the end for America~’s lead in this industry, as China, South Korea and Japan increase their investments in fusion technology.

====Overall funding increase~’s key====
**Holland 12** – Andrew, Senior Fellow for Energy and Climate – American Security Project, &amp;#34;A Tough Budget for Fusion&amp;#34;, American Security Project Blog, 3-1, http://americansecurityproject.org/blog/2012/the-budget-for-fusion/

The cut in the domestic fusion program would have a devastating impact on U.S. fusion research. It would  shut down the Alcator C-Mod at MIT, one of the three facilities critical to continued U.S. leadership in fusion.
The truth is, that after years of operating on minimal budgets and essentially level funding, the domestic fusion program cannot absorb the proposed reductions without significant negative impacts to the program and our scientific and engineering contributions.
It is very important that this budget is changed, not only to save this 
AND
, www.fusionfuture.org that details the importance of this budget.
They have also put together an excellent graph on the future of the fusion budget: as you can see on the graph that the MIT student put together (at left), the purple part is the U.S. budget commitment to ITER, which will crowd out over 3/4 of the total budget.
ASP believes that the fusion budget should be increased significantly, up to the point 
AND
be able to capitalize on the advancements in fusion science that will come.

====Happens immediately, even if sustained fusion is far off====
**Silverstein 12** (Ken, Editor of Energy Central and Contributor – Forbes, &amp;#34;The Tantalizing Promise And Peril Of Nuclear Fusion&amp;#34;, Forbes Magazine, 4-15, http://www.forbes.com/sites/kensilverstein/2012/04/15/nuclears-strongest-potential-weapon-fusion/)

&amp;#34;Despite fusion~’s tantalizing benefits, it has been largely ignored in energy policy discussions because it is viewed as a technology too immature to affect energy production over the next few decades, when it is most needed,&amp;#34; says the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The lab, which is part of a %243.5 billion research effort to help commercialize fusion, says that the United States is in a &amp;#34;unique position to change this paradigm.&amp;#34;
To be clear, fusion is different from fission, which is how today~’s nuclear reactor~’s produce energy. Fission splits atoms apart whereas fusion combines them — a process that thus far consumes more energy than it generates. The aim, though, is to heat the hydrogen gas to more than 100 million degrees Celsius so that the atoms will bond instead of bounce off each another.
If scientists are ultimately able to achieve success, the end result would be the production of 10 million times more power than a typical chemical reaction, such as the burning of fossil fuels. And it would occur without the carbon emissions or the disposal of high-level radioactive waste.
To that end, an international consortium has already spent %2420 billion on fusion 
AND
the scientific and engineering skills needed to bring such a concept to scale.
What immediate benefits do those participants get from funding ITER, or from making their own national investments in nuclear fusion? Magnet technology is one area, which is used in medical devices such as magnetic resonance imagery that allows doctor~’s see completely inside the human brain.
That~’s what Michael Claessens, head of communications for ITER Organization, explained to this reporter in an email. Superconducting and advanced materials are two additional benefits, he notes, adding that more such bonuses will occur in the future, as it does with any high-level research.

====Spinoffs will occur in optics====
**Pomeroy 12** (Ross, Assistant Editor – RealClearScience, &amp;#34;Fusion: The Energy of Tomorrow, Today&amp;#34;, Real Clear Science, 6-21, http://www.realclearscience.com/articles/2012/06/21/fusion_the_energy_of_tomorrow_today_10-http://www.realclearscience.com/articles/2012/06/21/fusion_the_energy_of_tomorrow_today_10 6303.html)

We face a severe potential emergency. External threats serve to unite. The world faces an unrecognized nuclear peril%21 Uniting to confront it can generate the missing popular and government support to generate millions of jobs and revitalize the global economy.
A THREAT GREATER THAN ANY TERROR ATTACK%21
A NASA funded study by the National Academy of Sciences was titled Severe Space Weather Events—Understanding Societal and Economic Impacts. The resulting Report detailed what might happen in the event of a solar megastorm launching a powerful Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) that strikes our geomagnetic field. The study predicts blackouts that may last for years. As the map above indicates, highly vulnerable areas include most of the Eastern and Northwestern parts of the nation.
The NOAA estimates each 11 year sunspot cycle is capable of launching 4 &amp;#34;extreme&amp;#34; (X class) CMEs and 100 &amp;#34;severe&amp;#34; CMEs at the earth. More X class events than were anticipated have occurred in the current cycle. The most dangerous period is the next 5 years. The peak peril is predicted by some to occur in May, 2013.
So far, neither NASA nor NOAA have publicly acknowledged the mortal threat these events may cause as the result of multiple meltdowns of nuclear plants worldwide. To date, there is no indication that the White House, Congress, Homeland Security, the Department of Defense and/or the Nuclear Regulatory Commission have adequately prepared to prevent the horrendous effects of such a solar megastorm.

====The recent statement by a NASA scientist that human life would not end as the result of the direct effects of a solar storm during 2012 is misleading. A solar megastorm that causes widespread meltdowns of numerous nuclear power plants can seriously end millions, if not hundreds of millions, or even billions, of lives from radioactivity. This event could very well parallel the aftermath of a nuclear weapons exchange had there been war between the USA and the USSR — massive amounts of radioactivity carried on prevailing winds all over the planet. The issue is not the specific year. This entire 11 year sunspot cycle should be of concern. ====

===C-Mod – 1AC===

====Alcator C-Mod will close without federal fusion funding – DOE~’s key to reverse the shutdown order====
**Lin 9-7**-12
(Leon, writer for The Tech at MIT, &amp;#34;Alcator C-Mod may lose funds,&amp;#34; http://tech.mit.edu/V132/N35/alcator.html-http://tech.mit.edu/V132/N35/alcator.html)

President Obama~’s budget request to Congress for fiscal year (FY) 2013, announced in February, proposed to shut down MIT~’s federally-funded Alcator C-Mod, a tokamak (toroidal magnetic confinement device). To give itself six more months to agree on a formal appropriations bill, Congress will pass a continuing resolution this month. The resolution will likely sustain funding for Alcator C-Mod at current levels until the final budget for FY 2013 is out. If the final budget passed by Congress is in line with the president~’s request, technical, engineering, and administrative staff would be laid off, and some 30 PhD students in Nuclear Science %26 Engineering (Course 22) would be forced to graduate by October 2013. The Department of Energy (DOE) has ordered Alcator C-Mod not to operate in the interim. However, researchers at the tokamak will not begin dismantling the device just yet, in case Congress decides to resume funding for research at Alcator C-Mod, which aims to develop a source of clean energy from nuclear fusion power. &amp;#34;Our best information at this point indicates that C-Mod will be put into a ~’ready standby,~’&amp;#34; says Zach S. Hartwig, a Course 22 PhD student, who believes and hopes that there will be no layoffs. &amp;#34;We are essentially buckling down until the next continuing resolution, due in February or March of 2013, or approved FY13 budget, under which we hope to receive funding to resume full experimental operations.&amp;#34; In June, 12 MIT PhD students, including Hartwig, and an undergraduate from the University of Texas at Austin visited Congress, meeting with almost 30 congressional offices. &amp;#34;Our goal was to educate congressional offices on the situation and ask for support for domestic fusion in the upcoming continuing resolution,&amp;#34; says Hartwig. The only three tokamaks in operation in the United States are Alcator C-Mod, DIII-D at General Atomics, and NSTX at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory. The presidential FY 2013 budget would cut money out of all three to support ITER (International Thermonuclear Expansion Reactor), an international project to build the biggest and best tokamak fusion reactor yet. Of the three, Alcator C-Mod has received the smallest share of the DOE~’s fusion energy funding. Alcator C-Mod is also the only one that would be completely shut down under the presidential budget request. The budget request allocates about %24150 million to ITER contributions (up nearly %2450 million from FY 2012) and about %24250 million to domestic programs, maintaining the total of about %24400 million that has gone to fusion energy sciences in the past few years. The Senate Energy and Water Subcommittee has proposed legislation with similar numbers. The House Energy and Water Subcommittee, however, has proposed a bill that would supply about %24300 million to the domestic fusion energy program and about %24180 million to ITER. According to Hartwig, &amp;#34;%24300 million is a widely agreed upon ~’minimum funding~’ level required to maintain a robust, successful domestic program.&amp;#34; Does the U.S. need three tokamaks? The heads of DIII-D, Alcator C-Mod, and NSTX told Nature for the journal~’s July article that all three sites contribute uniquely to science and preliminary research for ITER. They have also argued that a strong domestic fusion energy presence will be necessary to benefit from ITER results. &amp;#34;We must be training the next generation of fusion scientists and engineers, which requires domestic facilities to train them on, as well as maintaining our scientific lead as one of the great fusion powerhouses of the world, which requires our unique domestic facilities to perform the research, if we hope to be ~’building~’ fusion power plants in the future rather than ~’buying~’ them from China or Europe. Sacrificing the domestic program for ITER makes no sense,&amp;#34; says Hartwig. The ITER budget has nearly quintupled since the U.S. became an ITER partner, said Hartwig, and at the time the DOE and &amp;#34;the U.S. fusion community&amp;#34; agreed that funds would not be siphoned from domestic programs to support ITER. Alcator C-Mod is the single largest experiment at MIT, according to http://fusionfuture.org, which was started by graduate students to campaign against funding cuts. According to Hartwig, it~’s the largest in terms of both of funding and number of people employed. Alcator C-Mod supports about 120 people directly, including scientists, professors, students, and technical staff. The grant money also supports the equivalent of about 100 MIT staff and another 80 full-time jobs from subcontracting. Supporters of the domestic fusion program foresee serious consequences if Congress decides to wind down Alcator C-Mod in FY 2013. Hartwig worries that MIT~’s plasma physics group will disappear. Hartwig also echoes fusionfuture.org~’s warning that &amp;#34;without an increase in funding, the domestic fusion program will be effectively eliminated to pay for ITER.&amp;#34;

We must prevent these new highly dangerous and destructive nuclear weapons from being developed. The time to do so is now, before their feasibility is established. Once feasibility is demonstrated, the pressures from nuclear weapons laboratories as well as the military establishment to design and build them will be immense. We have one advantage over the time when fission-triggered thermonuclear weapons were developed in the 1950s. We have a CTBT that bans all nuclear explosions.
Besides the nuclear dangers that pure fusion weapons would pose, there is an immediate

Given the insistent international calls for nuclear disarmament and the requirement of the thirty-year-old Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) that nuclear powers end the nuclear arms race at an &amp;#34;early date,&amp;#34; those powers could hardly announce an explicit goal for developing pure fusion weapons.

&#xD;
DEBATE about America~’s energy supply is heating up: gas prices are rising, ethanol is under attack and nuclear power continues to struggle in the shadow of the Fukushima disaster in Japan.&#xD;
But an abundant, safe and clean energy source once thought to be the stuff of science fiction is closer than many realize: nuclear fusion. Making it a reality, however, will take significant investment from the government at a time when spending on scientific research is under threat.&#xD;
Harnessing nuclear fusion, the energy that powers the sun and the stars, has been a goal of physicists worldwide since the 1950s. It is essentially inexhaustible and it can be created using hydrogen isotopes — chemical cousins of hydrogen, like deuterium — that can readily be extracted from seawater.&#xD;
Fusion energy is created by fusing two atomic nuclei, in the process converting mass to energy, which appears as heat. The heat, as in conventional nuclear fission reactors, turns water into steam, which drives turbines to generate electricity, or is used to produce fuels for transportation or other uses.&#xD;
Fusion energy generates zero greenhouse gases. It offers no chance of a catastrophic accident. It can be available to all nations, relying only on the Earth~’s oceans. When commercialized, it will transform the world~’s energy supply.&#xD;
There~’s a catch. The development of fusion energy is one of the most difficult science and engineering challenges ever undertaken. Among other challenges, it requires production and confinement of a hot gas — a plasma — with a temperature around 100 million degrees Celsius.&#xD;
But potential solutions to these daunting technical challenges are emerging. In one approach, &#xD;
AND&#xD;
combustion engine, with multiple mini-explosions (about five per second).&#xD;
Once a poorly understood area of research, plasma physics has become highly developed. Scientists not only produce 100 million-degree plasmas routinely, but they control and manipulate such &amp;#34;small suns&amp;#34; with remarkable finesse. Since 1970 the power produced by magnetic fusion in the lab has grown from one-tenth of a watt, produced for a fraction of a second, to 16 million watts produced for one second — a billionfold increase in fusion energy.&#xD;
Seven partners — the European Union, China, India, Japan, Russia, South Korea and the United States — have teamed up on an experiment to produce 500 million watts of fusion power for 500 seconds and longer by 2020, demonstrating key scientific and engineering aspects of fusion at the scale of a reactor.&#xD;
However, even though the United States is a contributor to this experiment, known as ITER, it has yet to commit to the full program needed to develop a domestic fusion reactor to produce electricity for the American power grid. Meanwhile other nations are moving forward to implement fusion as a key ingredient of their energy security.&#xD;
Indeed, fusion research facilities more modern than anything in the United States are either under construction or operating in China, Germany, Japan and South Korea. The will and enthusiasm of governments in Asia to fill their energy needs with fusion, as soon as possible, is nearly palpable.&#xD;
What has been lacking in the United States is the political and economic will. We need serious public investment to develop materials that can withstand the harsh fusion environment, sustain hot plasma indefinitely and integrate all these features in an experimental facility to produce continuous fusion power.&#xD;
This won~’t be cheap. A rough estimate is that it would take %2430 billion and 20 years to go from the current state of research to the first working fusion reactor. But put in perspective, that sum is equal to about a week of domestic energy consumption, or about 2 percent of the annual energy expenditure of %241.5 trillion.&#xD;
Fusion used to be an energy source for my generation~’s grandchildren; now, plans &#xD;
AND&#xD;
that will shape our future. Scientists and engineers stand ready to help.&#xD;

The world we face in 2012 is of a different character than even a few years ago. Many developing nations are fragile states and are under enormous pressure from terrorism, endemic poverty, environmental challenges, debt, corruption, civil unrest, and regional, tribal, and religious conflicts. The result is a climate of despair, and potential breeding grounds for radical politics and extremism.&#xD;
A successful American foreign policy must include thinking through actions and policies, and how &#xD;
AND&#xD;
years. Too often we tend to confuse tactical action for strategic thinking. &#xD;
A matter of mutual understanding&#xD;
American foreign policy has always required a principled realism that is true to our values as we face the world as it really is in all of its complexities. We need to accept the reality that there is not a short-term solution to every problem in the world. What we must do is manage these realities and complex problems, moving them into positions of solution possibilities and resolution.&#xD;
American foreign policy has always dared to project a vision of a world where all &#xD;
AND&#xD;
little margin for error with the stakes so high in the world today.&#xD;
America must strengthen its global alliances. Common-interest alliances will be required in &#xD;
AND&#xD;
economic, intelligence, diplomatic, humanitarian, military and law enforcement fields.&#xD;
The centrality of alliances and multi-lateral institutions to a successful foreign policy is fundamental. Alliances and multi-lateral institutions must be understood as expansions of our influence, not as constraints on our power.  Alliances are imperfect, as are all institutions. But like &amp;#34;process,&amp;#34; they help absorb shocks.&#xD;
Beyond military solutions&#xD;
Alliances must be built on solid foundations to handle both routine and sudden unforeseen challenges. Crisis-driven &amp;#34;coalitions of the willing&amp;#34; by themselves are not the building blocks for a stable world. We need to think more broadly, deeply and strategically.&#xD;
American military power and force structure cannot sustain its commitments without a shift to a more comprehensive strategic approach to global threats and a more flexible and agile military. Cyber warfare is a paramount example of these new threats.&#xD;
The perception of American power around the world must not rest solely on a military orientation or optic. There must be an underlying commitment to engagement and humanity. Engagement is not appeasement, nor is it negotiation. It is not a guarantee of anything, but rather a smart diplomatic bridge to better understanding and possible conflict resolution.&#xD;
American foreign policy must reflect the realities and demands of the global economy. The &#xD;
AND&#xD;
strength must be as high a priority as any other foreign policy priority.&#xD;
America~’s security and growth are connected to both the American and global economies. A centerpiece of this security is energy security. Energy security and energy interdependence are interconnected parts of a broad and deep foreign policy paradigm that frames the complexity of the challenges that face America and the world.&#xD;

Hartwig, a Course 22 PhD student, who believes and hopes that there will be no layoffs. &amp;#34;We are essentially buckling down until the next continuing resolution, due in February or March of 2013, or approved FY13 budget, under which we hope to receive funding to resume full experimental operations.&amp;#34; In June, 12 MIT PhD students, including Hartwig, and an undergraduate from the University of Texas at Austin visited Congress, meeting with almost 30 congressional offices. &amp;#34;Our goal was to educate congressional offices on the situation and ask for support for domestic fusion in the upcoming continuing resolution,&amp;#34; says Hartwig. The only three tokamaks in operation in the United States are Alcator C-Mod, DIII-D at General Atomics, and NSTX at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory. The presidential FY 2013 budget would cut money out of all three to support ITER (International Thermonuclear Expansion Reactor), an international project to build the biggest and best tokamak fusion reactor yet. Of the three, Alcator C-Mod has received the smallest share of the DOE~’s fusion energy funding. Alcator C-Mod is also the only one that would be completely shut down under the presidential budget request. The budget request allocates about %24150 million to ITER contributions (up nearly %2450 million from FY 2012) and about %24250 million to domestic programs, maintaining the total of about %24400 million that has gone to fusion energy sciences in the past few years. The Senate Energy and Water Subcommittee has proposed legislation with similar numbers. The House Energy and Water Subcommittee, however, has proposed a bill that would supply about %24300 million to the domestic fusion energy program and about %24180 million to ITER. According to Hartwig, &amp;#34;%24300 million is a widely agreed upon ~’minimum funding~’ level required to maintain a robust, successful domestic program.&amp;#34; Does the U.S. need three tokamaks? The heads of DIII-D, Alcator C-Mod, and NSTX told Nature for the journal~’s July article that all three sites contribute uniquely to science and preliminary research for ITER. They have also argued that a strong domestic fusion energy presence will be necessary to benefit from ITER results. &amp;#34;We must be training the next generation of fusion scientists and engineers, which requires domestic facilities to train them on, as well as maintaining our scientific lead as one of the great fusion powerhouses of the world, which requires our unique domestic facilities to perform the research, if we hope to be ~’building~’ fusion power plants in the future rather than ~’buying~’ them from China or Europe. Sacrificing the domestic program for ITER makes no sense,&amp;#34; says Hartwig. The ITER budget has nearly quintupled since the U.S. became an ITER partner, said Hartwig, and at the time the DOE and &amp;#34;the U.S. fusion community&amp;#34; agreed that funds would not be siphoned from domestic programs to support ITER. Alcator C-Mod is the single largest experiment at MIT, according to http://fusionfuture.org, which was started by graduate students to campaign against funding cuts. According to Hartwig, it~’s the largest in terms of both of funding and number of people employed. Alcator C-Mod supports about 120 people directly, including scientists, professors, students, and technical staff. The grant money also supports the equivalent of about 100 MIT staff and another 80 full-time jobs from subcontracting. Supporters of the domestic fusion program foresee serious consequences if Congress decides to wind down Alcator C-Mod in FY 2013. Hartwig worries that MIT~’s plasma physics group will disappear. Hartwig also echoes fusionfuture.org~’s warning that &amp;#34;without an increase in funding, the domestic fusion program will be effectively eliminated to pay for ITER.&amp;#34;&#xD;

&#xD;
We must prevent these new highly dangerous and destructive nuclear weapons from being developed. The time to do so is now, before their feasibility is established. Once feasibility is demonstrated, the pressures from nuclear weapons laboratories as well as the military establishment to design and build them will be immense. We have one advantage over the time when fission-triggered thermonuclear weapons were developed in the 1950s. We have a CTBT that bans all nuclear explosions.&#xD;
Besides the nuclear dangers that pure fusion weapons would pose, there is an immediate &#xD;
AND&#xD;
regarding which fusion explosions, if any, might be regarded as legal.&#xD;
As my colleague Hisham Zerriffi will explain, the negotiating record regarding fission explosions as &#xD;
AND&#xD;
laser fusion machines, like NOVA in Livermore and GEKKO XII in Japan.&#xD;
No country has actually announced the goal of building pure fusion weapons. Given the insistent international calls for nuclear disarmament and the requirement of the thirty-year-old Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) that nuclear powers end the nuclear arms race at an &amp;#34;early date,&amp;#34; those powers could hardly announce an explicit goal for developing pure fusion weapons.&#xD;
Pure fusion weapons have long been a dream for nuclear weapons designers. Present-&#xD;
AND&#xD;
relatively small pure fusion weapons would be much larger than today~’s nuclear weapons.&#xD;

&#xD;
Fourth, a robust fusion industry would have important spillover effects that previous technological breakthroughs experienced. Just as discoveries and innovations in the space industry led to GPS technology and cell phones, advancements in the fusion industry would create new business applications.&#xD;
Fusion energy holds great promise, and the scientific community is &amp;#34;united&amp;#34; in the belief that its commercialization is possible. But, several challenges remain.&#xD;
The first problem is scientific. More research and development is needed for the technology to mature, and serious hurdles have to be passed before it is ready for commercial application.&#xD;
The second problem is more immediate. The industry is under threat from budget cuts from Congress, which could derail ongoing research, dismantle the workforce, and push a date for first ~’burning plasma~’ further off into the future. Fusion cuts could spell the end for America~’s lead in this industry, as China, South Korea and Japan increase their investments in fusion technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
====Overall funding increase~’s key====&#xD;

&#xD;
The cut in the domestic fusion program would have a devastating impact on U.S. fusion research. It would  shut down the Alcator C-Mod at MIT, one of the three facilities critical to continued U.S. leadership in fusion.&#xD;
The truth is, that after years of operating on minimal budgets and essentially level funding, the domestic fusion program cannot absorb the proposed reductions without significant negative impacts to the program and our scientific and engineering contributions.&#xD;
It is very important that this budget is changed, not only to save this &#xD;
AND&#xD;
, www.fusionfuture.org that details the importance of this budget.&#xD;
They have also put together an excellent graph on the future of the fusion budget: as you can see on the graph that the MIT student put together (at left), the purple part is the U.S. budget commitment to ITER, which will crowd out over 3/4 of the total budget.&#xD;
ASP believes that the fusion budget should be increased significantly, up to the point &#xD;
AND&#xD;
be able to capitalize on the advancements in fusion science that will come.&#xD;

====Happens immediately, even if sustained fusion is far off====&#xD;
**Silverstein 12** (Ken, Editor of Energy Central and Contributor – Forbes, &amp;#34;The Tantalizing Promise And Peril Of Nuclear Fusion&amp;#34;, Forbes Magazine, 4-15, http://www.forbes.com/sites/kensilverstein/2012/04/15/nuclears-strongest-potential-weapon-fusion/)&#xD;
&#xD;
&amp;#34;Despite fusion~’s tantalizing benefits, it has been largely ignored in energy policy discussions because it is viewed as a technology too immature to affect energy production over the next few decades, when it is most needed,&amp;#34; says the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The lab, which is part of a %243.5 billion research effort to help commercialize fusion, says that the United States is in a &amp;#34;unique position to change this paradigm.&amp;#34;&#xD;
To be clear, fusion is different from fission, which is how today~’s nuclear reactor~’s produce energy. Fission splits atoms apart whereas fusion combines them — a process that thus far consumes more energy than it generates. The aim, though, is to heat the hydrogen gas to more than 100 million degrees Celsius so that the atoms will bond instead of bounce off each another.&#xD;
If scientists are ultimately able to achieve success, the end result would be the production of 10 million times more power than a typical chemical reaction, such as the burning of fossil fuels. And it would occur without the carbon emissions or the disposal of high-level radioactive waste.&#xD;
To that end, an international consortium has already spent %2420 billion on fusion &#xD;
AND&#xD;
the scientific and engineering skills needed to bring such a concept to scale.&#xD;
What immediate benefits do those participants get from funding ITER, or from making their own national investments in nuclear fusion? Magnet technology is one area, which is used in medical devices such as magnetic resonance imagery that allows doctor~’s see completely inside the human brain.&#xD;
That~’s what Michael Claessens, head of communications for ITER Organization, explained to this reporter in an email. Superconducting and advanced materials are two additional benefits, he notes, adding that more such bonuses will occur in the future, as it does with any high-level research.&#xD;

Fusion research generates spin-off technologies —- budget cuts make this impossible

Fourth, a robust fusion industry would have important spillover effects that previous technological breakthroughs experienced. Just as discoveries and innovations in the space industry led to GPS technology and cell phones, advancements in the fusion industry would create new business applications.
Fusion energy holds great promise, and the scientific community is &amp;#34;united&amp;#34; in the belief that its commercialization is possible. But, several challenges remain.
The first problem is scientific. More research and development is needed for the technology to mature, and serious hurdles have to be passed before it is ready for commercial application.
The second problem is more immediate. The industry is under threat from budget cuts from Congress, which could derail ongoing research, dismantle the workforce, and push a date for first ’burning plasma’ further off into the future. Fusion cuts could spell the end for America’s lead in this industry, as China, South Korea and Japan increase their investments in fusion technology.
Overall funding increase’s key

The cut in the domestic fusion program would have a devastating impact on U.S. fusion research. It would  shut down the Alcator C-Mod at MIT, one of the three facilities critical to continued U.S. leadership in fusion.
The truth is, that after years of operating on minimal budgets and essentially level funding, the domestic fusion program cannot absorb the proposed reductions without significant negative impacts to the program and our scientific and engineering contributions.
It is very important that this budget is changed, not only to save this 
AND
, www.fusionfuture.org that details the importance of this budget.
They have also put together an excellent graph on the future of the fusion budget: as you can see on the graph that the MIT student put together (at left), the purple part is the U.S. budget commitment to ITER, which will crowd out over 3/4 of the total budget.
ASP believes that the fusion budget should be increased significantly, up to the point 
AND
be able to capitalize on the advancements in fusion science that will come.
Happens immediately, even if sustained fusion is far off
Silverstein 12 (Ken, Editor of Energy Central and Contributor – Forbes, &amp;#34;The Tantalizing Promise And Peril Of Nuclear Fusion&amp;#34;, Forbes Magazine, 4-15, http://www.forbes.com/sites/kensilverstein/2012/04/15/nuclears-strongest-potential-weapon-fusion/)
&amp;#34;Despite fusion’s tantalizing benefits, it has been largely ignored in energy policy discussions because it is viewed as a technology too immature to affect energy production over the next few decades, when it is most needed,&amp;#34; says the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The lab, which is part of a %243.5 billion research effort to help commercialize fusion, says that the United States is in a &amp;#34;unique position to change this paradigm.&amp;#34;
To be clear, fusion is different from fission, which is how today’s nuclear reactor’s produce energy. Fission splits atoms apart whereas fusion combines them — a process that thus far consumes more energy than it generates. The aim, though, is to heat the hydrogen gas to more than 100 million degrees Celsius so that the atoms will bond instead of bounce off each another.
If scientists are ultimately able to achieve success, the end result would be the production of 10 million times more power than a typical chemical reaction, such as the burning of fossil fuels. And it would occur without the carbon emissions or the disposal of high-level radioactive waste.
To that end, an international consortium has already spent %2420 billion on fusion 
AND
the scientific and engineering skills needed to bring such a concept to scale.
What immediate benefits do those participants get from funding ITER, or from making their own national investments in nuclear fusion? Magnet technology is one area, which is used in medical devices such as magnetic resonance imagery that allows doctor’s see completely inside the human brain.
That’s what Michael Claessens, head of communications for ITER Organization, explained to this reporter in an email. Superconducting and advanced materials are two additional benefits, he notes, adding that more such bonuses will occur in the future, as it does with any high-level research.

Holland 12 – Andrew, Senior Fellow for Energy and Climate – American Security Project, &amp;#34;A Tough Budget for Fusion&amp;#34;, American Security Project Blog, 3-1, http://americansecurityproject.org/blog/2012/the-budget-for-fusion/
The cut in the domestic fusion program would have a devastating impact on U.S. fusion research. It would  shut down the Alcator C-Mod at MIT, one of the three facilities critical to continued U.S. leadership in fusion.
The truth is, that after years of operating on minimal budgets and essentially level funding, the domestic fusion program cannot absorb the proposed reductions without significant negative impacts to the program and our scientific and engineering contributions.
It is very important that this budget is changed, not only to save this 
AND
, www.fusionfuture.org that details the importance of this budget.
They have also put together an excellent graph on the future of the fusion budget: as you can see on the graph that the MIT student put together (at left), the purple part is the U.S. budget commitment to ITER, which will crowd out over 3/4 of the total budget.
ASP believes that the fusion budget should be increased significantly, up to the point 
AND
be able to capitalize on the advancements in fusion science that will come.
Happens immediately, even if sustained fusion is far off
Silverstein 12 (Ken, Editor of Energy Central and Contributor – Forbes, &amp;#34;The Tantalizing Promise And Peril Of Nuclear Fusion&amp;#34;, Forbes Magazine, 4-15, http://www.forbes.com/sites/kensilverstein/2012/04/15/nuclears-strongest-potential-weapon-fusion/)
&amp;#34;Despite fusion’s tantalizing benefits, it has been largely ignored in energy policy discussions because it is viewed as a technology too immature to affect energy production over the next few decades, when it is most needed,&amp;#34; says the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The lab, which is part of a %243.5 billion research effort to help commercialize fusion, says that the United States is in a &amp;#34;unique position to change this paradigm.&amp;#34;
To be clear, fusion is different from fission, which is how today’s nuclear reactor’s produce energy. Fission splits atoms apart whereas fusion combines them — a process that thus far consumes more energy than it generates. The aim, though, is to heat the hydrogen gas to more than 100 million degrees Celsius so that the atoms will bond instead of bounce off each another.
If scientists are ultimately able to achieve success, the end result would be the production of 10 million times more power than a typical chemical reaction, such as the burning of fossil fuels. And it would occur without the carbon emissions or the disposal of high-level radioactive waste.
To that end, an international consortium has already spent %2420 billion on fusion 
AND
the scientific and engineering skills needed to bring such a concept to scale.
What immediate benefits do those participants get from funding ITER, or from making their own national investments in nuclear fusion? Magnet technology is one area, which is used in medical devices such as magnetic resonance imagery that allows doctor’s see completely inside the human brain.
That’s what Michael Claessens, head of communications for ITER Organization, explained to this reporter in an email. Superconducting and advanced materials are two additional benefits, he notes, adding that more such bonuses will occur in the future, as it does with any high-level research.
