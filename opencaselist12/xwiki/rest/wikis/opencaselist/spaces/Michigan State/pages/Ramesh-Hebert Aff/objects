it~’s a sign that the Republican challenger still has a way to go. 

====No impact====
**Roberts 11** (Russ, Professor of Economics – George Mason University and Research Scholar – Hoover Institution, &amp;#34;Political Reality Overtakes Principles So Winner Won~’t Matter&amp;#34;, The Boston Globe, 9-18, Lexis)

HOW IMPORTANT is the 2012 presidential election? Imagine being visited in 2008 by a

from both sides would itself be considered a major achievement in bilateral relations.

====No cooperation====
**Kramer 10** (David, Senior Transatlantic Fellow – German Marshall Fund and Former Assistant Secretary of State, &amp;#34;Resetting U.S.-Russian Relations: It Takes Two&amp;#34;, Washington Quarterly, January, p. 61-62)

President Barack Obama deserves credit for his initial efforts to reverse the deterioration in relations 
AND
issues offers much promise for building a strong foundation for the bilateral relationship. 

====No chance of overt hostility====
Newsday 5 (2-27, Lexis)

Relations between Washington and Moscow are now more like a marriage of convenience. It~’s 
AND
to cooperate on mutually useful issues and by fundamental disagreements not easily resolved.

====No alternative to nature – already irreversibly altered nature====

Zimmerman 3 (Michael, Professor of Philosophy – Tulane University, Eco-Phenomenology : Back to the Earth Itself, p. 79-80)

Heidegger~’s talk of &amp;#34;letting things be,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;caring for beings,&amp;#34; and being 
AND
(if not &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;pristine&amp;#34;) condition.2°

====(  ) Particularity beats ontology args. Such universals are wrong and makes poor scholarship. ====

**Potrc ~’4**

Metaphysics: Ultimate and Regional Ontology – Inf. Filosofica, I/2004, 1, pp. 21-45. Also available as doc via conventional google search)

Thus there is still the following logical possibility. (1) The ultimate ontology 
AND
namely the rich and common sense compatible world of everyday objects and events.
 (  ) Heidegger~’s K of technology is too sweeping – lacks particularity.

Adria ~’8
(Marco Adria – Director of the Graduate Program in Communications and Technology University of Alberta – The Journal of Community Informatics – Vol 4, No 1 (2008) – http://www.ci-journal.net/index.php/ciej/article/view/426/392)

A totalizing view of technology is evident in the work of Virilio, as it 
AND
insight and rich description, from which strategies for action may be devised. 


====(  ) &amp;#34;Conflix&amp;#34; frames Ballot~’s role. Defends State-based, Role Play as better curriculum than critical theory.====

This paper is a mixture of narrative and theory. The narratives were collected from

====(  ) Science K over-abandons science. Even if it created the problem, we can~’t throw it out with the bathwater.====

Critics of the Enlightenment may have correctly emphasized the price of progress, the costs 
AND
These questions transcend the crude categories of technical criteria and slide-rule measurements


====(  ) Science doesn~’t need meta-physical grounding. Its ontology is pragmatism.====

**Bronner ~’4**
Stephen Eric Bronner, Distinguished Professor of Political Science and a Member of the Graduate Faculty in Comparative Literature and German Studies at Rutgers University, 2004 (Reclaiming the Enlightenment: Toward a Politics of Radical Engagement, Published by Columbia University Press, ISBN 9780231126090, p. 162-163)

Reclaiming the Enlightenment calls for clarifying the aims of an educated sensibility in a disenchanted 
AND
its immanent workings from the standpoint of what externally inspired its development.12 


====(  ) Logic serves as Science~’s ontology====

Bachelard ~’90 
(Suzanne – Professor of Philosophy at Sorbonne – A Study of Husserl~’s Formal and Transcendental Logic – page 72)

Logic, as science of science, as the theory which serves as norm for 
AND
is accepted which is categorially formed in the judging&amp;#34; (i 18). 


====(  ) Scientific Method accurate – fact checking and self-correction====

**Cohen ~’7**
(et al – Louis Cohen is Emeritus Professor of Education at Loughborough University. Research methods in education – pg. 6-7)

A further means by which we set out to discover truth is research. This 
AND
particularly as far as the natural sciences are concerned (Burg 1963).~’


====(  ) K of our particular science claims is wrong. Their sweeping claim~’s based on astonishing ignorance and rationalization====

**Gross ~’98**
(et al, Paul R. Gross, who is a University Professor of Life Sciences (Emeritus) at the University of Virginia. He has taught at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, New York University, Brown University, and the University of Rochester –Higher Superstition: The Academic Left and Its Quarrels with Science. Page 6)

It would seem to follow, then, that the last eight or ten years 
AND
credits itself are in themselves sufficient to guarantee the validity of the critique.


====(  ) Epistemic K of science is wrong and won~’t change science one bit.====

**Gross ~’94**

 ~~[Their criticism~~] is more a matter of rhetorical style than of logical 
AND
for which we must read &amp;#34;historians&amp;#34; and sociologists). (69)


====(  ) Science accurate and we~’ll epistemologically indict your authors. ====

**Salmon ~’94**

He has taught at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, New York University, Brown University, and the University of Rochester.

Science has brought us penicillin, the polio vaccine, the green revolution in agriculture
AND
and Levitt tell us, Ross knows &amp;#34;virtually nothing&amp;#34; about science.

===Manufacturing – 1AC===

====SMRs key to manufacturing – other designs don~’t solve –====

====1) Scale and flexibility====
**Freed 10**
(Josh, director of the Clean Energy Program at Third Way, &amp;#34;Thinking Small on Nuclear Power,&amp;#34; September 2010, [[http://content.thirdway.org/publications/340/Third_Way_Idea_Brief_-_Thinking_Small_On_Nuclear_Power.pdf-http://content.thirdway.org/publications/340/Third_Way_Idea_Brief_-_Thinking_Small_On_Nuclear_Power.pdf]])

The imperative of creating more diverse clean energy applications has spawned the design of several 
AND
existing nuclear waste into electricity, dramatically reducing problems of waste storage. 14

====2) Uses domestic components – and spurs exports====
**ITA 11**
(U.S. Department of Commerce – International Trade Administration, &amp;#34;The Commercial Outlook in the U.S. for Small Modular Reactors,&amp;#34; 2-09-11, [[http://nuclearinfrastructure.org/resources/20110209CommerceSMRReport.pdf-http://nuclearinfrastructure.org/resources/20110209CommerceSMRReport.pdf]])

Impact of SMRs on U.S. Job Creation A serious obstacle to the 
AND
opposed to the localiza tion that is typically necessary for building larger reactors. 

====Specifically key to the chemical industry====
**Huddar 12**
(Lakshana, Supply Chain Management Intern at Bayer HealthCare and writer for the Berkeley Energy and Resources Collaborative, &amp;#34;AREVA~’S NUCLEAR REACTOR DESIGN GETS GREEN LIGHT FOR FURTHER DEVELOPMENT,&amp;#34; 3-6-12, [[http://berc.berkeley.edu/arevas-nuclear-reactor-design-gets-green-light-for-further-development/-http://berc.berkeley.edu/arevas-nuclear-reactor-design-gets-green-light-for-further-development/]])

AREVA~’s small modular nuclear reactor design was recently chosen by the Next Generation Nuclear Plant 
AND
in the chemical industry. The specific process depends on the output temperature.

====Solves extinction====
**Baum 99 **(Rudy M., C%26EN Washington, Chemical and Engineering News, Millennium Special Report, 12-6, [[http://pubs.acs.org/hotartcl/cenear/991206/7749spintro2.html-http://pubs.acs.org/hotartcl/cenear/991206/7749spintro2.html]])

Here is the fundamental challenge we face: The world~’s growing and aging population must 
AND
mysteries and provide for humanity~’s basic and not-so-basic needs.

====Chemical industry checks bio-accumulation====

Burton, &amp;#34;What is the Relationship Among Cleaner Production, Pollution Prevention, Waste Minimization and ISO 14000?&amp;#34;, [[http://www.unep.fr/shared/publications/other/WEBx0072xPA/manual_cdrom/-http://www.unep.fr/shared/publications/other/WEBx0072xPA/manual_cdrom/]] CPlinks/pdfs/con199601.pdf)

The chemical industry is critical for sustainable development because of its primary role in the

Bioaccumulative toxins are dangerous because amounts that seem harmless are multiplied as they pass through 
AND
if it is continued, can only lead to the extinction of humans.

The communications and computer networks used to control nuclear forces are supposed to be firewalled 
AND
, rather than less, vulnerable to the threats of the 21st century.

====Heg solves extinction====
**Brzezinski 12** (Zbigniew, Professor of American Foreign Policy at the School of Advanced International Studies – Johns Hopkins University, Counselor – CSIS and Trustee and Co-Chair – CSIS Advisory Board, Former National Security Advisor – Carter, &amp;#34;After America&amp;#34;, Foreign Policy, January / February, [[http://www.foreignpolicy.com/artic-http://www.foreignpolicy.com/artic]] les/2012/01/03/after_america?page=full)

Manufacturing is a Key Driver of Employment Growth and Source of High-paying Jobs 
AND
jobs they support—will be by increasing U.S. manufacturing.

====Extinction====

an attractive option by governments) than is diversion from fissile fuel cycles.
In principle, tritium in D-T fusion reactors could be stolen by subnational

the sense that fissile materials are (1 1 2, 1 13).
The development of an ICF capability by countries not possessing thermonuclear weaponry could convey insights and calculational capabilities relevant to the design of such weapons (112, 114). This, too, is a possible concern with respect to governments but not with respect to subnationa1 groups, and its importance even in the case of governments has been the subject of considerable disagreement (115).

===T – Must Remove Barriers – 2AC===

====Reduce means to make smaller – not to eliminate====
**Collins 9**
(Collins English Dictionary – Complete %26 Unabridged, 10^^th^^ Edition, [[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/reduce?s=ts-http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/reduce?s=ts]])

reduce (rɪˈdjuːs) — vb ( also intr ) to make or become smaller in size, number, extent, degree, intensity, etc

====Restriction means policy limitation – including regulation====
**PLD 12**
(People~’s Law Dictionary – site last updated 2012, [[http://dictionary.law.com/Default.aspx?selected=1835-http://dictionary.law.com/Default.aspx?selected=1835]])

restriction n. any limitation on activity, by statute, regulation or contract provision. In multi-unit real estate developments, condominium and cooperative housing projects managed by homeowners~’ associations or similar organizations, such organizations are usually required by state law to impose restrictions on use. Thus, the restrictions are part of the &amp;#34;covenants, conditions and restrictions&amp;#34; intended to enhance the use of common facilities and property which are recorded and incorporated into the title of each owner.

====Licensing is a barrier to SMR production====
**DOE 12**
(U.S. Department of Energy – Nuclear Energy – Subcommittee on Small Modular Reactors, &amp;#34;A Strategic Framework for SMR Deployment,&amp;#34; 2-24-12, [[http://www.ne.doe.gov/smrsubcommittee/documents/SMR%20Strategic%20Framework.pdf-http://www.ne.doe.gov/smrsubcommittee/documents/SMR Strategic Framework.pdf]])

The potential barrier that licensing could pose to the commercial development of SMRs puts it at the forefront of strategic issues. Phase 1 of the strategic framework is focused directly on this challenge. Assuming this can be overcome, the next issue is to understand the potential for SMRs to compete in the marketplace. To assess this challenge, a quick review of the basic SMR business model may be useful.

====Seriously, it~’s a restriction====
**NRC 5**
(Nuclear Regulatory Commission, &amp;#34;Backgrounder on Nuclear Power Plant Licensing Process,&amp;#34; July 2005, [[http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/licensing-process-bg.html-http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/licensing-process-bg.html]])

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is responsible for licensing and regulating the operation 
AND
health and safety, the common defense and security, and the environment.

====Plan reduces that restriction====
**Navetta 10**
(Michael S., Manager at Energy Park Initiative, &amp;#34;Small Modular Reactor Demonstration Complex,&amp;#34; [[http://www.srscro.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Small-Modular-Reactor-Demonstration-Complex.pdf-http://www.srscro.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Small-Modular-Reactor-Demonstration-Complex.pdf]])

Within the test bed, the design, construction, and operation of the SMR would be demonstrated in parallel with the NRC licensing process. This would effectively remove NRC rulemaking and licensing from the critical path of commercial deployment; enabling schedule savings of up to 10 years. 

====The LWR regulatory structure is a restriction====
**Reynolds 10**
(Roger S., Adjunct Mechanical Engineering Professor WSU Tri-Cities, &amp;#34;APPLICABILITY OF THE NRC LIGHT WATER REACTOR LICENSING PROCESS TO SMRs,&amp;#34; July 2010, [[https://smr.inl.gov/Document.ashx?path=DOCS%2fReading+Room%2fPolicy+and+regulation%2fANS+SMR+APPLICABILITY+OF+THE+NRC+LWR+LICENSING+PROCESS+910.pdf-https://smr.inl.gov/Document.ashx?path=DOCS%2fReading+Room%2fPolicy+and+regulation%2fANS+SMR+APPLICABILITY+OF+THE+NRC+LWR+LICENSING+PROCESS+910.pdf]])

All SMR designs deviate to a greater or lesser extent from the standard large-
AND
that currently govern the licensing of nuclear power reactors in the United States.

====Plan allows SMRs to deviate from those restrictions====

The deployment of advanced reactors of the type proposed for Generation IV will require a

These will surely challenge the existing regulatory system if changes are not made.

Relations between Washington and Moscow are now more like a marriage of convenience. It~’s

**Joyner 99** (Christopher C., Professor of International Law – Georgetown U., 5 ILSA J Int~’l %26 Comp L 377, June)

Use of the debate can be an effective pedagogical tool for education in the social 
AND
the real world of policy analysis, political critique, and legal defense.    

====Advocacy of fusion eliminates conflation with fission —- unlocks support that saves the planet====
**Aberdeen 7** (Doug, Software Engineer, &amp;#34;Nuclear Fusion and Politics&amp;#34;, 5-4, http://dougsrants.blogspot.com/2007/05/nuclear-fusion-and-politics.html)

We have a much better chance of saving the planet if we can teach our politicians the difference AND
 I suspect the fusion confusion is wide spread, and that slows down funding to the area.


====(  ) General Neg ev about the State or Role-Play is too sweeping. Our PARTICULAR Conflix model teaches strategies for dealing with racial and non-race based oppression.====

According to Chang, the &amp;#34;different voice thesis&amp;#34; subscribes to a version of

to seek an epistemology that does not claim to know an objective reality. 

====Their politics essentializes, excludes alternative perspectives, and breeds counterproductive adversarialism====

Nuclear power • Nuclear power disproportionately affects communities of color, from the mining of uranium on Native American lands, to the targeting of black and Hispanic communities for new uranium processing facilities to the targeting of black and Hispanic and Native American communities for so-called &amp;#34;low-level&amp;#34; nuclear waste disposal sites.

During every U.S. presidential election campaign, there is a debate in 
AND
from both sides would itself be considered a major achievement in bilateral relations.

====No cooperation====
**Kramer 10** (David, Senior Transatlantic Fellow – German Marshall Fund and Former Assistant Secretary of State, &amp;#34;Resetting U.S.-Russian Relations: It Takes Two&amp;#34;, Washington Quarterly, January, p. 61-62)

President Barack Obama deserves credit for his initial efforts to reverse the deterioration in relations 
AND
issues offers much promise for building a strong foundation for the bilateral relationship. 

====No chance of overt hostility====
Newsday 5 (2-27, Lexis)

Relations between Washington and Moscow are now more like a marriage of convenience. It~’s 
AND
to cooperate on mutually useful issues and by fundamental disagreements not easily resolved.

====No impact to relations====
**Ostapenko 9** (E., Staff Writer – Trend Daily News, &amp;#34;Normalization In U.S.-russian Relations Not To Change Political Situation In World: Analyst At French Studies Institute&amp;#34;, Turkish Weekly, 7-7, http://www.turkishweekly.net/news/83734/-normalization-in-u-s-russian-relations-not-to-change-political-situation-in-world-analyst-at-french-studies-institute-.html-http://www.turkishweekly.net/news/83734/-normalization-in-u-s-russian-relations-not-to-change-political-situation-in-world-analyst-at-french-studies-institute-.html)

Normalization of relations between the United States and Russia will not assume a global significance 
AND
Moisi considers the absence of problems with the aging of population, unlike European countries, including Russia.

===Elections – Obama Good – Russia Scenario – 1AR===

A rockier road
The potential impact of a Romney presidency on US-Russian relations could be significant
AND
-conservativism, populist isolationism, realism, liberal internationalism) is unclear.

====No difference —- Obama can~’t sustain relations and Romney will moderate====
**Kramer 12** (David, President – Freedom House and Former Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, and Lilia Shevtsova, Senior Fellow – Carnegie Endowment, Moscow, &amp;#34;Obama vs. Romney: Who Would Putin Pick?&amp;#34;, The American Interest, 9-11, http://www.the-american-interest.com/article.cfm?piece=1312)

Does all this mean that Russia would prefer to see Obama reelected? Would the

Obama presidency could become a serious test for both—Russia and America.

It is not only axiomatic but also true that federal science policy is largely played

===Fusion – Heidegger K – 2AC===

====(  ) Particularity beats ontology args. Avoids sweeping claims without denying some basic objective facts exist. ====

**Potrc ~’4**

Metaphysics: Ultimate and Regional Ontology – Inf. Filosofica, I/2004, 1, pp. 21-45. Also available as doc via conventional google search)

But respect for the ontological difference is a must if you take metaphysics seriously, 
AND
you first encountered in the area of the existent, the ontic stuff. 



====Fusion checks massive death tolls and doesn~’t link to Heidegger or Managerialism. If it does, then any alt would, too. ====

**Lorimer ~’92** 
(Doug, Professor Emeritus – Tri University and Member – National Executive of the Democratic Socialist Party, &amp;#34;Should We Oppose Fusion Technology?&amp;#34;, Green Left Weekly, 2-19, http://www.greenleft.org.au/node/2210)

Undemocratic technology? While he points out that with &amp;#34;more human and financial resources
AND
achieve. And Marxists certainly shouldn~’t oppose it because it requires scientific knowledge.



====(  ) The K~’s too sweeping. Fusion R%26D does use conventional science, but doesn~’t solely rest on exclusionary epistemology====

**Siler ~’7 **

The controlled superconducting magnets increase and decrease the pressures and temperatures of plasma within the

the Fractal Reactor is no less than the actualization of that bold goal.


====Too late: intervention has irreparably altered the environment. Abandoning management risks extinction.====

Levy 99 (Neil, Ph.D. in Comparative Literature and Critical Theory – Monash University, and Currently Tutor, Centre for Critical Theory – Monash University, Discourses of the Environment edited by Eric Darier, p. 214-215)

If our current situation can really be accurately characterized as the extension of bio-
AND
of those with whom we share this planet, will be decided. 


====Fusion is a direct challenge to the military-industrial complex —- conflating nuclear energy with weapons plays into the hands of elites====
**Razani 12** (Rezwan, Executive Director – Focus Fusion Society, &amp;#34;Batman Fusion Redemption&amp;#34;, Fusion Energy League, 7-26, http://www.fusionenergyleague.org/index.php/blog/article/batman_fusion_redemption)

Fusion doesn~’t melt down.  TDKR confuses fission and fusion.  Fission (FIZZ) 
AND
Nuclear Energy Loses.
Nuclear Weapons WIN.



====(  ) Science K over-abandons science. Even if it created the problem, we can~’t throw it out with the bathwater.====

Critics of the Enlightenment may have correctly emphasized the price of progress, the costs

transcend the crude categories of technical criteria and slide-rule measurements.&amp;#34;7

The 2008 General Election was a perfect storm for Democrats across the country and Ohio 
AND
for Governor Romney, but so could a host of upper Midwest states.


====Multiple factors make this prediction impossible – Eurozone, Iran, healthcare, GOP infighting – AND ANY of them could sway the election in EITHER direction====

The principal objective of the U.S. program of fusion energy research and

DEAN: Originally, say ten years ago, it was supposed to cost like five billion dollars. Today, it~’s around 20 billion, maybe a little bit AND
 important potential hole in the international physics development.

====Otherwise, other countries will pull the plug on collaboration====

===Fusion – Elections – Obama Good 2AC – Clay Octos===


====Romney win- demographic changes in Midwest swing states====
Dave **Hartline**, worked on Capital Hill after his masters founder of the Catholic Report **10-7**-2012 http://the-american-catholic.com/2012/10/07/the-data-and-demographics-that-detail-why-romney-will-defeat-obama-in-ohio/?utm_source=feedburner%26utm_medium=feed%26utm_campaign=Feed%3A+AmericanCatholic+%28The+American+Catholic%29-http://the-american-catholic.com/2012/10/07/the-data-and-demographics-that-detail-why-romney-will-defeat-obama-in-ohio/?utm_source=feedburner%26utm_medium=feed%26utm_campaign=Feed%3A+AmericanCatholic+%28The+American+Catholic%29
The 2008 General Election was a perfect storm for Democrats across the country and Ohio 
AND
for Governor Romney, but so could a host of upper Midwest states.


====Voter suppression undermines Obama====
Julianne **Malveaux** is a Washington, D.C.-based economist and writer. She is President Emerita of Bennett College for Women in Greensboro, N.C., **10-7**-2012 http://www.insightnews.com/commentary/9637-polls-dont-decide-elections-http://www.insightnews.com/commentary/9637-polls-dont-decide-elections

In late September, the &amp;#34;nonpartisan&amp;#34; Web site Real Clear Politics reported that 
AND
talk show host Hugh Hewitt that &amp;#34;Democratic enthusiasm is going to recede.&amp;#34;


====Fusion~’s too small====
**Eriksson 11** (Jimmy, Professional freelancer in Green Technology and Scientific Development – RPN, &amp;#34;Fusion Energy: The Truth&amp;#34;, Renewable Power News, 6-23, http://www.renewablepowernews.com/archives/2580)

Nuclear fusion energy remains vague or unknown to the general public for many years. 
AND
manipulate its commercial prospects. Can fusion energy live up to its promises?

====Neither side will campaign on it====
**Wood 12** (Elisa, Two Decade Contributor – McGraw-Hill/Platts Energy and Long-Time Energy Writer, &amp;#34;What Obama and Romney Don~’t Say About Energy&amp;#34;, AOL Energy, 9-13, http://energy.aol.com/2012/09/13/what-obama-and-romney-dont-say-about-energy/)

Fossil fuels and renewable energy have become touchy topics in this election, with challenger Mitt Romney painting President 
AND
say industry observers. Even those who see nuclear as safe, say they understand why the candidates would want to steer clear of the discussion.

====Fission incentives now====
**Goodman 12** (Amy, Award Winning Journalist – The Guardian and Host – Democracy Now%21, &amp;#34;Big Nuclear~’s Cosy Relationship with the Obama Administration&amp;#34;, The Guardian, 3-8, http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/-http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/ cifamerica/2012/mar/08/big-nuclear-cosy-relationship-obama-administration)

This is mind-boggling, on the first anniversary of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, with the chair of the US Nuclear Regulatory 
AND
Pac money), President Obama is fulfilling his promise to push nuclear power.


====Public supports fusion spending====
**Webster 10** (AJ, &amp;#34;Fusion Energy Branch&amp;#34;, Submission to the Institute of Physics Plasma Visions Survey 2010, 11-22)

Block Grant Funding: CCFE is funded through a block-grant from EPSRC, which allows CCFE to deliver an efficient mission-AND
 have been positive statements about fusion from influential politicians and respected scientists.

====Evidence about fission doesn~’t apply====
**Simonen 00** (T.C., Professor of Physics – University of California, Berkeley, &amp;#34;What is Happening With Fusion Energy?&amp;#34;, The Industrial Physicist, April, https://web.gat.com/pubs-ext/miscpubs/A23372.pdf)

Fusion energy, the result of fusing light atoms such as hydrogen to form heavier 
AND
much energy as 300 gallons of gasoline with just a little helium exhaust.

====Israeli strikes coming —- triggers the link====
**Feehery 12** (John, Reporter – The Hill, &amp;#34;October Surprise&amp;#34;, The Hill – Pundit~’s Blog, 8-28, http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/presidential-campaign/245965-october-surprise)

What will this election~’s October Surprise be?
AND
 between now and November, including a big-time October Surprise. 

====DoE funds the plan —- that~’s Hammond. Shields Obama.====
**Fox 9** (Justin, Professor of Political Science – Yale University and Stuart V. Jordan, Professor of Political Science – University of Rochestor, &amp;#34;Delegation and Accountability&amp;#34;, 12-16, http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1524585)

Can legislators control bureaucrats~’ exercise of delegated authority? This question has motivated the bulk of positive studies of 
AND
executive, and delegation necessarily diminishes \legislative power and with it accountability.&amp;#34;

====Can~’t predict the election====
**Cunningham 11** (Pat, Columnist – RRS, &amp;#34;Here~’s Why Outcome of Next Presidential Election is Impossible to Predict at this Point&amp;#34;, Rockford Register Star, 12-13, http://blogs.e-rockford.com/applesauce/2011/12/13/heres-why-outcome-of-next-presidential-election-is-impossible-to-predict-at-this-point/)

Forty-seven weeks from today, tens of millions of Americans will flock to 
AND
know at this point, it might turn out to be a landslide. 


====Their 1NC impact says Obama is Bush-lite on foreign policy- no substantive differences  between candidates- newest Bandow article proves- divided congress and few distinctions====
Doug **Bandow** is a senior fellow at the Cato Institute. He is a former special assistant to President Reagan and the author of several books, including Foreign Follies: America~’s New Global Empire (Xulon Press). **9-3-**2012 http://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/voting-president-lesser-evil-is-still-rather-evil-http://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/voting-president-lesser-evil-is-still-rather-evil

In a little over two months Americans will go to the polls to elect their 
AND
battled the Democratic president. The future is likely to be no different.


====Relations decline inevitable====
**Bovt 12** (Georgy, Political Analyst – Moscow Times, &amp;#34;Whether Obama or Romney, the Reset Is Dead&amp;#34;, Moscow Times, 9-11, http://www.themoscowtimes.com/opinion/article/whether-obama-or-romney-the-reset-is-dead/467947.html)

During every U.S. presidential election campaign, there is a debate in 
AND
from both sides would itself be considered a major achievement in bilateral relations.

Undemocratic technology? While he points out that with &amp;#34;more human and financial resources

====Particularity should be the standard for rejoinder. ====
**Smith ~’6**
Dr. Benedict Smith – Research Fellow in the Department of Philosophy and a member of staff at the University of Durham – Acta Analytica – Volume 21, Number 2 – available via Springer Link Database

In a related way, Dancy seeks to undermine certain ~’coercive~’ (Dancy 1993:

**====Method not first – policy better. Endless methods become nexus questions – hurt clash with rest of the Aff. Anti-politics is normative offense. ====**
**Fearon %26Wendt 2K**
~~James, Professor of Poli Sci at Stanford, Alexander, Professor of IR at Ohio State, Handbook of International Relations, ed. Carlsnaes, p. 68~~
It should be stressed that in advocating a pragmatic view we are not endorsing method
AND
, but we certainly believe a conversation should continue on all three levels.


====Sweeping tech K~’s wrong, empowers Right====
**Bronner 4** – Stephen Eric Bronner, Professor of Political Science at Rutgers University, 2004, Reclaiming the Enlightenment: Toward a Politics of Radical Engagement, p. 160

Critics of the Enlightenment may have correctly emphasized the price of progress, the costs 
AND
transcend the crude categories of technical criteria and slide-rule measurements.&amp;#34;7


====Fusion solves fission waste and Yucca storage. Even if full-fusion is distant, fusion neutron harnessing isn~’t. ====
**UT~’9 ** 
(This is a Multi-Disciplinary release from the University of Texas – it internally quotes Physics Professors, Mechanical Engineers, and Fusion Experts. &amp;#34;Nuclear Fusion-Fission Hybrid Could Destroy Nuclear Waste and Contribute to Carbon-Free Energy Future&amp;#34;, 1-27, This article also appears in This article also appears in Science Daily on Jan 29^^th^^ – both web addresses are included: http://www.utexas.edu/news/2009/01/27/nuclear_hybrid/-http://www.utexas.edu/news/2009/01/27/nuclear_hybrid/; http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/01/090127131654.htm)
&amp;#34;We have created a way to use fusion to relatively inexpensively destroy the waste 
AND
product of fusion—neutrons—can be achieved in the near term.


====(  ) that checks violent waste policy towards Native Americans.====
**Ewall ~’11  **

Fusion doesn~’t melt down. TDKR confuses fission and fusion. Fission (FIZZ) 
AND
energy with nuclear weapons means: Nuclear Energy Loses. Nuclear Weapons WIN.


====We solve inequitable distribution. Their pessimism bias only boosts violent forms of progress.====
**Charlesworth ~’7**

Now, the other part of the question is - why the U.S. federal government in particular, and not state

it nationally allows it to be coordinated nationally, reducing duplication of effort.


====CP~’s legally tech transfer —- jacks solvency====

&amp;#34;We have created a way to use fusion to relatively inexpensively destroy the waste 
AND

===ITER – 1AC===

====Contention 2 —- ITER====

====EU support for ITER is failing —- they~’re carefully watching for signs of momentum before deciding whether to commit funds====
**Pero 12** (Hervé, Acting Director of Energy within the Directorate General for Research – European Commission, &amp;#34;The Next Six Months Will Be Crucial&amp;#34;, ITER Newsline, ~~%23244, 5-25, http://www.iter.org/newsline/–224/1178)

There are good reasons why the European Union supports, and will continue to support, ITER.
AND
next weeks, which are critical in order to confirm the success of the proposed recovery plan.

====Domestic funding signals U.S. commitment to ITER====
**Hutchinson 5** (Ian H., Head of the Nuclear Science Department – MIT, &amp;#34;Fusion Research: What About the U.S.?&amp;#34;, Technology Review, http://www.technologyreview.com/article/404616/fusion-research-what-about-the-us/2/)

The United States still has two world-renowned tokamaks — one at MIT, 
AND
vision as a scientific collaborator by revitalizing its overall fusion program.

====Federal budget is the focal point====
**Sarewitz 3** (Daniel, Professor of Science and Society and Co-Director of the Consortium for Science, Policy and Outcomes – Arizona State University, &amp;#34;Does Science Policy Exist, and If So, Does it Matter?: Some Observations on the U.S. R%26D Budget&amp;#34;, Discussion Paper for Earth Institute Science, Technology, and Global Development Seminar, 4-8, http://www.cspo.org/documents/budget_seminar.pdf)

It is not only axiomatic but also true that federal science policy is largely played 
AND
trends? The first thing to be said is that it depends on which trends one chooses to examine.

====Plan builds foreign political support for collaboration====

Executing this transition of the program, and eventually deploying an integrated fusion nuclear science 
AND
could be fatally damaged if these transitions are not managed adroitly.

====U.S. scientists will pull the plug on ITER without domestic funding====
**Hand 12** (Eric, Knight Science Journalism Fellow – Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Reporter – Nature, &amp;#34;US Fusion in Budget Vice&amp;#34;, Nature, 7-24, http://www.nature.com/news/us-fusion-in-budget-vice-1.11061)

For years, US researchers have been steadfast in their support of ITER, the world~’s largest fusion-energy 
AND
 this happens again in 2014, I~’m not so sure.&amp;#34;

====Collapses the project====
**Holdren 95** (John P., Professor of Energy – University of California, Berkeley, et al., &amp;#34;The U.S. Program of Fusion Energy Research and Development&amp;#34;, Report of the Fusion Review Panel – The President~’s Committee of Advisors on Science and Technology, July, http://science.energy.gov/~~/media/fes/fesac/pdf/1990-99/1995_jul.pdf)

Today, I will provide two inspiring examples that could form the basis of a more cooperative approach 
AND
such notions are no longer insignificant from an International Relations point of view.

====Globalist value convergence is possible and solves multiple existential threats====
**Seita 97** (Alex Y., Professor of Law – Albany Law School of Union University, &amp;#34;Globalization and the Convergence of Values&amp;#34;, Cornell International Law Journal, 30 Cornell Int~’l L.J. 429, Lexis)

The convergence of basic political and economic values is thus fundamentally important because it helps 
AND
also reduce human suffering and perhaps eliminate completely the risk of nuclear war.

**ITER~’s key to science  diplomacy**

Finally, some types of science a&amp;#34; particularly those that address the grand challenges

The key to congressional action is to strike when the iron is hot. In 
AND
second term rests on the hypothesis that the House Republicans can be broken.&amp;#34;


====Relations resilient – visas not key ====
Fernandes 2 (George, Defense Minister – India, &amp;#34;Weighing Inspections&amp;#34;, The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer, 8-28, Lexis)

GEORGE FERNANDES, Defense Minister, India: Well, I don~’t think they should 
AND
even more potential for growth as both sides learn to trust one another.


====No India-Pakistan war====
Khan 12 (Ikram Ullah, analyst for the South Asian Strategic Stability Institute, &amp;#34;Nuclear Pakistan: Defence Vs Energy Development,&amp;#34; 7/26, http://www.eurasiareview.com/26072012-nuclear-pakistan-defence-vs-energy-development-oped/)
We must be clear that nuclear weapons are here to maintain peace and stability between 
AND
it prevented the likelihood of an all out nuclear war in South Asia.


====Strong Congressional support for fusion research====
**Rowberg 00** (Richard E., Senior Specialist in Science and Technology in the Resources, Science, and Industry Division – CRS, &amp;#34;Congress and the Fusion Energy Sciences Program: A Historical Analysis&amp;#34;, Congressional Research Service Report, 1-31, http://fire.pppl.gov/RL30417.pdf)

In the 1990s, Congress maintained its support of the goals of the fusion program 
AND

====Energy focus outweighs budget concerns====
**Rowberg 00** (Richard E., Senior Specialist in Science and Technology in the Resources, Science, and Industry Division – CRS, &amp;#34;Congress and the Fusion Energy Sciences Program: A Historical Analysis&amp;#34;, Congressional Research Service Report, 1-31, http://fire.pppl.gov/RL30417.pdf)

6. Federal budget constraints.
Throughout the past 42 years, Congress has on a number of occasions stated that 
AND
problems, may override those constraints to some degree.


====DoE does the plan —- that~’s 1AC Miller —- shields the link====
**Schoenbrod 93** (David, Professor of Law – New York Law School, Adjunct Scholar – Cato Institute and Former Staff Attorney and Co-Director – Project on Urban Transportation, Power Without Responsibility, p. 9-10)

Delegation, Like Budget Deficits, Hides Costs 
Delegation can shield our elected lawmakers from blame for harming the public not only when 
AND
by which a politician can appear to kiss both sides of the apple.&amp;#34;


====Winners win====
**Halloran 10** (Liz, Reporter – NPR, &amp;#34;For Obama, What A Difference A Week Made&amp;#34;, National Public Radio, 4-6, http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=125594396)

Amazing what a win in a major legislative battle will do for a president~’s spirit
AND
can reverse what the polls now suggest is a losing issue for them. 


====Capital isn~’t key====
**Dickinson 9** (Matthew, Professor of Political Science – Middlebury College and Former Professor – Harvard University, &amp;#34;Sotomayor, Obama, and Presidential Power&amp;#34;, Presidential Power: A NonPartisan Analysis of Presidential Politics, 5-26, http://blogs.middlebury.edu/presidentialpower/2009/05/26/sotamayor-obama-and-presidential-power/

As for Sotomayor, from here the path toward almost certain confirmation goes as follows
AND
has already occurred, in the decision to present Sotomayor as his nominee.

====Kerry supports the plan —- 1AC evidence —- key to the agenda====
**Leibovich 9** (Mark, Reporter – NYT, &amp;#34;After a Humbling Spiral, Kerry Returns to Form&amp;#34;, New York Times, 11-24, http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/25/us/politics/25kerry.html?_r=1%26ref=johnkerry)

Mr. Kerry~’s long, lined face will always suggest some weariness, and he is walking more slowly around the Capitol than he used to AND
 according to the senator~’s office.)


====Normal means is members of the House not Obama push the plan ====
**Cho 12**(Adian, staff writer for Science, &amp;#34;House Panel Would Protect Domestic Fusion Program,&amp;#34; April 19, http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2012/04/house-panel-would-protect-domest.html)
The details won~’t be out for another week, but in their version of the

====Huge fights coming over the debt ceiling====
**Walsh 1-3** – Liam, Reporter at The Courier Mail, &amp;#34;Market Rises as Disaster Averted&amp;#34;, The Courier Mail (Australia), 2013, Lexis

THE last-minute swerve away from the US ``fiscal cliff~’~’ yesterday boosted Australia~’s stockmarket - but the sting in the tail came with AND
Congress must act as early as mid-February to prevent a default.


====Science lobbies support the plan – focus on energy over military application====
**Yirka 12**(Bob, writer for Phys.org, &amp;#34;US National Academies panel recommends expanding alternative nuclear fusion experiments,&amp;#34; March 8, http://phys.org/news/2012-03-national-academies-panel-alternative-nuclear.html)

Fourth, a robust fusion industry would have important spillover effects 
AND
Japan increase their investments in fusion technology.

====Overall funding increase~’s key====
**Holland 12** – Andrew, Senior Fellow for Energy and Climate – American Security Project, &amp;#34;A Tough Budget for Fusion&amp;#34;, American Security Project Blog, 3-1, http://americansecurityproject.org/blog/2012/the-budget-for-fusion/

The cut in the domestic fusion program would have a devastating impact 
AND
be able to capitalize on the advancements in fusion science that will come.

====Happens immediately, even if sustained fusion is far off====
**Silverstein 12** (Ken, Editor of Energy Central and Contributor – Forbes, &amp;#34;The Tantalizing Promise And Peril Of Nuclear Fusion&amp;#34;, Forbes Magazine, 4-15, http://www.forbes.com/sites/kensilverstein/2012/04/15/nuclears-strongest-potential-weapon-fusion/)

&amp;#34;Despite fusion~’s tantalizing benefits, it has been largely

adding that more such bonuses will occur in the future, as it does with any high-level research.

====Spinoffs will occur in optics====
**Pomeroy 12** (Ross, Assistant Editor – RealClearScience, &amp;#34;Fusion: The Energy of Tomorrow, Today&amp;#34;, Real Clear Science, 6-21, http://www.realclearscience.com/articles/2012/06/21/fusion_the_energy_of_tomorrow_today_10-http://www.realclearscience.com/articles/2012/06/21/fusion_the_energy_of_tomorrow_today_10 6303.html)

It~’s high time that politicians, and indeed all Americans, recognize that a new

The role of agency in the political ontology of race reveals another problem: the 
AND
by the political ontology of race than by the social or biological ontologies.


====(  ) Sexton~’s entire K is de-contextual and based on poor evidence====

**Spickard ~’9	**
(Paul Spickard is a professor of history and Asian American studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Amalgamation Schemes: Antiblackness and the Critique of Multiracialism (review) American Studies, Volume 50, Number 1/2, Spring/Summer 2009, pp. 125-127 – Project Muse)
Sexton does point out, as do many writers, the flawed tendencies in multiracial 
AND
personal lives of the writers themselves. It is a pretty tawdry exercise.

(  ) Wilderson~’s too pessimistic – this reifies his own K and locks-in the worst oppression.

Whatever one might think of the cogency of these remarks (if only because the 
AND
of Red, White, and Black, as I hope to show.

(Note: the word &amp;#34;manichean&amp;#34; in this context means &amp;#34;a disparaging course of action that involves an overly-simplistic) choice between good and evil)

(  ) Wilderson~’s absolutism reifies and boosts violence towards blacks.

First published online: March 29, 2012 – doi: 10.1093/ywcct/mbs003 

For example, in Chapter One (~’The Structure of Antagonisms~’), written as a 
AND
for the same reason, must be thought differently for blackness to live.


(Note: the word &amp;#34;Human&amp;#34; in this card is a distinction made by Wilderson – where he says &amp;#34;Whites&amp;#34; = Human and he draws a distinction as it relates to Blacks. We are not arguing that Blacks are not human.)


(  ) Wilderson~’s claims are a link turn. Not a question of coalitions – it~’s just so extreme that it becomes impossible to create a bridge to revolution 

Allen ~’11

The cut in the domestic fusion program would have a devastating impact on U.S. fusion research. It 
AND
be able to capitalize on the advancements in fusion science that will come.

====Fusion research~’s critical to utilize low-temperature plasma====
**Cowley 10** – Plasma 2010 Committee, co-chaired by Steven C. Cowley, Ph.D. in the Department of Astrophysical Sciences at Princeton University and professor at Imperial College London at the Blackett Laboratory, and John Peoples, Jr., director emeritus of Fermilab and recipient of the Distinguished Service Award from the National Science Foundation, 2007 (National Research Council of the National Academies, &amp;#34;Plasma Science: Advancing Knowledge in the National Interest&amp;#34;, http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11960.html, p. 72-73)
Conclusion: Low-temperature plasma science and engineering share much intellectual space with other 
AND

====Happens quickly, even if sustained fusion~’s far off====
**Silverstein 12** (Ken, Editor of Energy Central and Contributor – Forbes, &amp;#34;The Tantalizing Promise And Peril Of Nuclear Fusion&amp;#34;, Forbes Magazine, 4-15, http://www.forbes.com/sites/kensilverstein/2012/04/15/nuclears-strongest-potential-weapon-fusion/)

&amp;#34;Despite fusion~’s tantalizing benefits, it has been largely ignored in energy policy discussions because it is viewed as a

 will occur in the future, as it does with any high-level research.

====Solves bioterror, Mad Cow, and battlefield decontamination====
**Kong 12** – Michael, Professor of Electronic, Electrical and Systems Engineering – Loughborough University (UK) and Ph.D. – University of Liverpool, &amp;#34;About Plasmas – Destroying Biological Hazards&amp;#34;, Coalition for Plasma Science, http://www.plasmacoalition.org/plasma_writeups/destroying-biohazards.pdf

Anthrax. Mad Cow Disease. Biological Weapons. These words have filled headlines, 
AND
of effectiveness and low cost, the future of plasma decontamination is bright.

====Bioterror causes extinction====
**Ochs 2** (Richard Ochs, Fmr President – Aberdeen Proving Ground Superfund Citizens Coalition, &amp;#34;Biological Weapons Must Be Abolished Immediately&amp;#34;, 6-9-2002, http://www.freefromterror.net/other_articles/abolish.html)

Of all the weapons of mass destruction, the genetically engineered biological weapons, many 
AND
Can we imagine hundreds of such plagues? HUMAN EXTINCTION IS NOW POSSIBLE. 

====Mad cow outbreaks collapse trade====
**Buzby 3** – Jean C., Economist in the Food Economics Division – USDA, Agricultural Economic Report No. (AER-828) 145, November, http://www.ers.usda.gov/media/321515/aer828a_1_.pdf

Mines
Fusion research causes spin-offs —- budget cuts make this impossible

(Nicholas, Policy Analyst for Energy and Climate – American Security Project, &amp;#34;The Future of Fusion&amp;#34;, American Security Project Blog, 6-5, http://americansecurityproject.org/blog/2012/the-future-of-fusion/)

Fourth, a robust fusion industry would have important spillover effects that previous technological breakthroughs 
AND
as China, South Korea and Japan increase their investments in fusion technology.
Don~’t need actualized reactors. Aff quickly gets neutron spinoffs that make de-mining effective.
**Kulcinski ~’96**

A complete discussion of all of the above applications is beyond the scope of this

It is estimated that several millions of active mines have been deployed so far in

Nearly 30,000 die a year
**Mannion 6** – Mannion—MA, MB, BChir, FRCS—and Chaloner—MA, BM, BCh, DMCC—2006. (Steve and Eddie, Pain Medicine, &amp;#34;Chapter 1 Landmines and Landmine Injuries: An Overview,&amp;#34; Volume 7, November, pg. 1)

Every 20 minutes, a person is killed or wounded by a landmine—80
AND
last landmine now in place would not be removed until the year 3100.
Mines are already in the ground and continue killing even if no more are laid —- active removal~’s key

Helene D., MD and MPH, Executive Board – CARE (Global Health NGO), &amp;#34;Philanthropy and Landmines&amp;#34;, January, http://www.synergos.org/globalgivingmatters/issuebriefs/01landmines.htm

Landmines wreak indiscriminate destruction. Each day, up to 55 people die or are 
AND
in countries in conflict or emerging from conflict — can afford it least.
Mines are forced danger that are life denying and make elective insecurity impossible
**Booth 7** – Dr. Kenneth, Professor of International Relations at the University of Aberystwyth, Theory of World Security, p. 104-105)

Perhaps the most hideous image of the congruity of insecurity and the determined life in

do not have the power to ask the question in the first place. 
Abstract theory does nothing to disprove or solve this impact

(et al, Dr Lloyd Pettiford is in the Department of International Studies, Nottingham Trent University, Clifton Lane,¶ Nottingham NGHJ 8NS, UK – Third World Quarterly – vol 19, ~~%231 – available via J-Stor)

The basic argument put forward is that whilst the security debate within¶ international relations 
AND
, we are not seeking to deny¶ the role of intellectual endeavor.
Current demining tech proves it won~’t be manipulated and will be shared —- key barrier is tech breakthroughs

The patronizing dismissal of the scientific exploration of the world, which¶ is proudly 
AND
philosophy to quixotic banality¶ and shallowness, however disguised in appeasing rhetoric.


====(  ) No, not ethics disad – consequences====

**Issac, ~’2  **
(Jeffery, Professor of Political Science at Indiana University, Dissent, Vol. 49 No. 2, Spring)
Politics, in large part, involves contests over the distribution and use of power
AND
not true believers. It promotes arrogance. And it undermines political effectiveness. 


====Extinction inevitable – too sweeping and denies human agency====

In the previous chapters I outlined two diametrically opposed views on the nature of technology 
AND
unwarranted. Consider the example proffered by the authors of Dialectic of Enlightenment.


====(  ) Democratic checks make their impacts impossible====

Dickinson ~’4
(UC Berkeley – History, Edward Ross, &amp;#34;Biopolitics, Fascism, Democracy: Some Reflections on Our Discourse About &amp;#34;Modernity,&amp;#34; Central European History, vol. 37, no. 1, 1–48)
In short, the continuities between early twentieth-century biopolitical discourse and the practices 
AND
of biopolitics, the only end point of the logic of social engineering.


==== (  ) Methods 1st wrong – making it an a priori question is counter-productive to its own objectives====

Chandler ~’10
(David Chandler is Professor of International Relations at the Department of Politics and International Relations, University of Westminster – Global Society, Vol. 24, No. 2, April, 2010 – http://www.davidchandler.org/pdf/journal_articles/Global%20Society%20-%20Chandler%20response.pdf)

In the special issue, Nicholas Kiersey and Doerthe Rosenow take direct issue with my 
AND
of the relationship between power and politics in this form of Foucauldian IR. 


====Expertism K~’s can go too far. We should consider many perspectives, but not sweepingly denounce people who know a lot about science. ====

Bronner ~’4
(Stephen, prof of political science at Rutgers, PhD from Berkeley &amp;#34;Reclaiming the Enlightenment,&amp;#34; Columbia University Press, p. 77-78)
But praise for the amateur also has its limits. To ignore the need for 
AND
knowledge, even though, obviously, he cannot cultivate all of them.&amp;#34; 

	
====The alternative to expertise is naïve faith- Palin proves this disastrous====

Harris ~’8 
(Sam, - Ph.D. in neuroscience from UCLA, CEO of Project Reason &amp;#34;When Atheists Attack,&amp;#34; http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2008/09/19/when-atheists-attack.html)

The prospects of a Palin administration are far more frightening, in fact, than 
AND
again and again, while more thoughtful people decide the fate of civilization. 

==== (  ) Reps-1st focus locks in violence====

Taft-Kaufman ~’95 
(Jill, Professor of Speech – CMU, Southern Communication Journal, 60(3), Spring)

The postmodern passwords of &amp;#34;polyvocality,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Otherness,&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;difference,&amp;#34; unsupported 
AND
political agendas, institutions, agencies, and the budgets that fuel them.

&#xD;
===Answers===&#xD;
&#xD;
====Plan~’s applied R%26D, solves limits====&#xD;
**EIA 99** – Energy Information Administration / Federal Energy Market Interventions 1999: Primary Energy, &amp;#34;3. Federal Energy Research and Development&amp;#34;, http://www.eia.gov/oiaf/servicerpt/subsidy/pdf/research.pdf&#xD;
&#xD;
Research and Development Defined&#xD;
Federal energy-related R%26D can be described as falling into three classes: basic research, research that seeks to develop new energy technologies, and research that seeks to improve existing technologies.&#xD;
AND&#xD;
highperformance, high-efficiency reactor technology, advanced nuclear fuels, and new technologies for the minimization and management of nuclear waste. The fiscal year 1999 appropriation for this program is %2419 million, out of the %2430 million for new or improved nuclear power plants.&#xD;
&#xD;
====Fusion generation is applied R%26D====&#xD;
**CFR 12** – Code of Federal Regulations, Department of Energy: Title 10 – Energy, PT. 500-End, p. 249-250&#xD;
&#xD;
3. Fusion Energy&#xD;
The magnetic fusion energy program is an applied research and development program whose &#xD;
AND&#xD;
future plasma and fusion devices. The program also pursues R%26D and system studies pertaining to critical feasibility issues of fusion technology and development.&#xD;
&#xD;
====DoE labs are key====&#xD;
**Holdren 99** (John P., Former Director and Faculty Chair in the Science, Technology and Public Policy Program – Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, Harvard University, &amp;#34;Powerful Partnerships: The Federal Role in International Cooperation on Energy Innovation&amp;#34;, President~’s Committee of Advisors on Science and Technology Report, June, http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2012/ph241/ferguson2/docs/pcast99_full.pdf)&#xD;
&#xD;
Beyond the market failures and barriers just discussed, other rationales for government involvement include &#xD;
AND&#xD;
non-energy policies are taken up in a separate subsection, below.&#xD;
&#xD;
====State funding fails: distributed risk and no jurisdiction====&#xD;
**Hartwig 12** – Zach, Ph.D. Candidate in Plasma Physics and Fusion Energy – MIT, BS in Physics – Boston University, Email Exchange with Casey Harrigan, 10-22, http://msudebate.blogspot.com/2012/10/exchange-with-hartwig.html&#xD;
&#xD;
Geoff forwarded me your email regarding the issues with federally funded fusion research. I agree with everything he said, &#xD;
AND&#xD;
Constitution so it~’s important that fusion is under federal jurisdiction at the moment)&#xD;
&#xD;
====Duplication and lack of coordination undermine solvency. And they can~’t fund PPPL.====&#xD;
**Olynyk 12** – Geoff, Ph.D. Candidate in Plasma Physics and Fusion Energy – MIT, B.Sc (Eng), Engineering Physics – Queen~’s University, Summer NSERC USRA Internship – Royal Military College of Canada, Email Exchange with Casey Harrigan, 10-22, http://msudebate.blogspot.com/2012/10/exchange-with-olynyk.html-http://msudebate.blogspot.com/2012/10/exchange-with-olynyk.html&#xD;
&#xD;
Now, the other part of the question is - why the U.S. federal government in particular, and not state &#xD;
AND&#xD;
it nationally allows it to be coordinated nationally, reducing duplication of effort.&#xD;
&#xD;
====Fusion is a direct challenge to the military-industrial complex —- conflating nuclear energy with weapons plays into the hands of elites====&#xD;
(**Yellow=1AC, Blue=2AC)&#xD;
**Razani 12** (Rezwan, Executive Director – Focus Fusion Society, &amp;#34;Batman Fusion Redemption&amp;#34;, Fusion Energy League, 7-26, http://www.fusionenergyleague.org/index.php/blog/article/batman_fusion_redemption-http://www.fusionenergyleague.org/index.php/blog/article/batman_fusion_redemption)&#xD;
&#xD;
Fusion doesn~’t melt down. TDKR confuses fission and fusion. Fission (FIZZ) &#xD;
AND&#xD;
energy with nuclear weapons means:¶ Nuclear Energy Loses.¶ Nuclear Weapons WIN.¶ &#xD;

====Spikes investor risk —- labs will opt out====&#xD;
Wood 12 (Tony, Energy Program Director at the Grattan Institute, an Australian think tank, &amp;#34;Building the Bridge,&amp;#34; July, http://grattan.edu.au/static/files/assets/a8778779/Building_the_bridge_report.pdf-http://grattan.edu.au/static/files/assets/a8778779/Building_the_bridge_report.pdf)&#xD;

Instead of paying at proposal stage, government can spread payments over a set of &#xD;

&#xD;
====Up-front payment~’s key to innovation —- prizes create cash-flow problems and jack certainty====&#xD;

&#xD;
Some of these disadvantages are also an outcome of traditional grants and procurement &#xD;
AND&#xD;
whole, there may be wasteful duplication of effort if these are simultaneous research programs all pursuing the same goal.&#xD;
&#xD;
====Government-sponsorship makes it ineffective====&#xD;
**Macauley 4** – Molly Macauley, Resources for the Future, 2004, Testimony before House Committee on Science, &amp;#34;NASA Prizes&amp;#34;, July 15, http://www.rff.org/Documents/RFF_CTs_04_macauley.pdf-http://www.rff.org/Documents/RFF_CTs_04_macauley.pdf&#xD;

&#xD;
Unlikely the privately funded X Prize, the Space and Aeronautics Prize relies primarily on &#xD;
AND&#xD;
, though, monetary prizes are a much more difficult sell in Congress. &#xD;
Efforts to pass government-sponsored monetary incentives for private space development have an abysmal track record in Congress. &#xD;
&#xD;
===Non-Grant CP – A2: Prizes – Ext – Links Politics===&#xD;
&#xD;
====Congress has to be involved====&#xD;
**Newell 5** (Richard G., Senior Fellow – Resources for the Future, and Nathan E. Wilson, Economist –Energy&#xD;

&#xD;
The issue becomes more complicated if the prize is a tool of government policy. &#xD;
AND&#xD;

&#xD;
The battle over &amp;#34;sequestration&amp;#34; - the name for the automatic spending cuts - is the latest in a series of fights &#xD;
AND&#xD;
projects, the White House said. But any new spending will face an uphill battle in Congress.&#xD;
&#xD;
===Non-Grant CP – 2AC===&#xD;
&#xD;
====Perm —- do the CP —- plan doesn~’t commit to a type of support —- CP is an example of possible action. Normal means competition kills the Aff —- abnormal means are infinite.====&#xD;
&#xD;
====Not textually competitive —- text is best: most objective and it avoids the worst counterplans====&#xD;
&#xD;
====Grants can have conditions====&#xD;

====Perm —- do both====&#xD;
&#xD;
====Conditionality is a voter —- creates time and strategy skews, argumentative irresponsibility, and dispo solves their offense====&#xD;
&#xD;
====PICs are a voter —- steals the Aff, crushing ground, diverts from topic-specific education, and disads alone check====&#xD;
&#xD;
====Doesn~’t solve —- grants are key to R%26D and credibility of tech====&#xD;

What is a Grant?&#xD;
The U. S. government has been issuing grants for more than 50 years&#xD;

====Cost-sharing crushes fusion R%26D====&#xD;
**NM 12** (New Millennium Nuclear Energy Partnership, &amp;#34;A Strategy for the Future of Nuclear Energy: The Consolidated Working Group Report&amp;#34;, June, http://content.thirdway.org/publications/540/Third_Way_Report_-_A_Strategy_for_the_Future_of_Nuclear_Energy.pdf)&#xD;
&#xD;
NEW NUCLEAR ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES&#xD;
It is an appropriate and necessary function of government to provide R%26D support &#xD;
AND&#xD;
requirements. As this fundamental research transitions to the demonstration and deployment stages, industry should shoulder an increasing share of the funding responsibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
====Upfront costs are huge====&#xD;
**Freed 11** (Josh, Vice President – Third Way Clean Energy Program, and Avi Zevin, Policy Advisor – Third Way, and Jesse Jenkins, Associate Director – Breakthrough Institute, &amp;#34;Making a Case for Innovation Investment in an Era of Austerity&amp;#34;, Third Way Memo, May, http://content.thirdway.org/publications/399/Third_Way_Memo_-_Making_a-http://content.thirdway.org/publications/399/Third_Way_Memo_-_Making_a _Case_for_Innovation_Investment_in_an_Era_of_Austerity.pdf)&#xD;
&#xD;
2. Energy R%26D Takes Much Longer to Payoff&#xD;
Many have pointed to the Information Technology boom as providing an antecedent to the clean &#xD;
AND&#xD;
health and defense increased by an average of %24167 million a year.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
===Private Sector CP – A2: Trade-Off===&#xD;
&#xD;
====Government R+D crowds-in private investment —- positive spillovers outweigh resource trade-offs====&#xD;
**Kammen 7** (Daniel, Professor in Public Policy Specializing in Energy and Resources – University of California, Berkeley, and Gregory F.

We also examined the thesis that these large programs &amp;#34;crowd out&amp;#34; other research &#xD;
AND&#xD;
across technologies, sectors, and the multiple stages of the innovation process.&#xD;
&#xD;
====Not zero-sum —- R%26D is only pre-commercial====&#xD;
**Stepp 11** (Matthew, Senior Analyst with the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF) Specializing in Climate Change and Clean Energy Policy, et al., &amp;#34;Counterpoint: Heritage Foundation Backgrounder&amp;#34;, 4-26, http://thebreakthrough.org/blog/Counterpoint_Heritage_BTI_ITIF_AEL.pdf)&#xD;

&#xD;
The nation~’s energy and climate challenge needs new thinking and approaches, like those found &#xD;

====Perm —- do both —- shields the link====

====Conditionality is a voter —- creates time and strategy skews, argumentative irresponsibility, and dispo solves their offense====

====Zero solvency: DoE nationals labs are key —- unique capabilities and international linkages make them essential to fusion —- that~’s Holdren====

====State~’s fiat is a voter —- contrived, no literature assumes uniformity, not reciprocal, and illogical because no single decision-maker could choose====

====CP~’s legally tech transfer —- jacks solvency====
**GAO 9** – United States Government Accountability Office, &amp;#34;Technology Transfer: Clearer Priorities and Greater Use of Innovative Approaches Could Increase the Effectiveness of Technology Transfer at Department of Energy Laboratories&amp;#34;, June, http://www.gao.gov/assets/300/290971.html

What GAO Found: Although DOE~’s laboratories routinely share their technologies, capabilities, and 
AND
of 2009 and the additional funding provided to DOE to meet those goals.

====Perm —- federal labs conduct research, states fund —- we didn~’t specify source of money====

====CP gets preempted or struck down because no jurisdiction —- only the fed can fund fusion because it~’s international and inter-state commerce —- states have no legal authority —- that~’s Hartwig====

====Prefer it: only evidence specific to fusion====

====Fusion~’s only federal====
**Hartwig 12** – Zach, Ph.D. Candidate in Plasma Physics and Fusion Energy – MIT, BS in Physics – Boston University, Email Exchange with Casey Harrigan, 10-23, http://msudebate.blogspot.com/2012/10/exchange-with-hartwig-2.html

One can make a strong argument that the Constitution explicitly assigns the federal government the 
AND
research; however, in practice and precedent, the federal government will almost exclusively fund fusion for the foreseeable future.

===EPSCoR Mechanism – 2AC Additions===
(FYI – THEIR TEXT – &amp;#34;The State and Territorial Governments in the Department of Energy~’s Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research should substantially increase financial support for federal programs for fusion energy generation in the United States.&amp;#34;)

====EPSCoR fails —-====

====Fusion~’s too expensive —- costs billions —- but EPSCoR~’s capped====
**NM 9** – New Mexico EPSCoR, &amp;#34;DOE EPSCoR State and National Laboratory Partnership Program&amp;#34;, 6-5, http://nmepscor.org/content/doe-epscor-state-and-national-laboratory-partnership-program

The Department of Energy~’s Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (DOE EPSCoR) is 
AND
support Laboratory infrastructure.
The solicitation requires a pre-application.

====States can only contribute 10%====
**EPSCoR 12** – EPSCoR/IDeA Foundation, &amp;#34;EPSCoR/IDeA In Fiscal Year 2013&amp;#34;, March, http://www.epscorideafoundation.org/documents/publications/EPSCoRinFY2013.pdf

Overview. Positioned within the Office of Science at DOE, DOE EPSCoR assists the 
AND
Grants allow EPSCoR researchers to work closely with the DOE National Laboratories to conduct collaborative research and train students.

====Money can only be given to certain jurisdictions====
**DoE 12** – Department of Energy, &amp;#34;Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) – How to Apply&amp;#34;, http://science.energy.gov/bes/epscor/how-to-apply/

AND
All project funds will be awarded to institutions within EPSCoR jurisdictions.

We know that fusion works, it is already being done in labs around the 
AND
of businesses, contractors, and researchers in every corner of the country.

===States CP – Addition – 2AC===

====Perm —- do the plan and fund support with state and territories~’ budgets —- doesn~’t sever: they say &amp;#34;financial support for federal programs for magnetic fusion&amp;#34; —- we don~’t commit to funding source, they do, we can add it====

====CP violates the MRA —- means no funding and rollback====
**Rubin 10** – Douglas, J.D. Candidate – University of Maryland School of Law and B.A. – University of Richmond, &amp;#34;How Supplemental Environmental Projects Can and Should be Used to Advance Environmental Justice&amp;#34;, University of Maryland Law Journal of Race, Religion, Gender and Class, Spring, 10 RRGC 179, Lexis

B. Most Courts Have Ruled that All Penalties Must go to the Treasury
The Miscellaneous Receipts Act (the &amp;#34;MRA&amp;#34;) states that &amp;#34;an official or

penalty, plaintiffs should offer equitable and statutory arguments to justify a SEP.

===Europe – 2AC===

====Fusion funding~’s key to foreign political support for collaboration====

Executing this transition of the program, and eventually deploying an integrated fusion nuclear science 
AND
program could be fatally damaged if these transitions are not managed adroitly.

====EU will bail on ITER —- next six months are key====
**Pero 12** (Hervé, Acting Director of Energy within the Directorate General for Research – European Commission, &amp;#34;The Next Six Months Will Be Crucial&amp;#34;, ITER Newsline, ~~%23244, 5-25, http://www.iter.org/newsline/–224/1178)

There are good reasons why the European Union supports, and will continue to support, ITER.
AND
The European Union will, along with the MAC, closely monitor the implementation of all actions during the next weeks, which are critical in order to confirm the success of the proposed recovery plan.

====That undermines overall US/EU relations —- multiple existential threats====
**Potočnik 3** (James, European Commissioner for Science and Research, &amp;#34;Between Cooperation and Competition - Science and Research as a Transatlantic Bridge Builder&amp;#34;, Europa, 3-7, http://www.iterfan.org/index.php?option=com_content%26task=view%26id=139%26Itemid=2)

The EU and the United States have a unique relationship as international partners. We share common AND
 Transatlantic co-operation in research is therefore an absolute necessity.

 to detect explosives, detect chemical pollution, and produce medical isotopes.

===Agenda Politics – Obama Good – 2AC===

====Ideology outweighs and no spillover====

Edwards, Distinguished Professor of Political Science at Texas A%26M University and Former Director of the Center for Presidential Studies, &amp;#34;Riding High in the Polls: George W. Bush and Public Opinion&amp;#34;, www.clas.ufl.edu/users/rconley/conferencepapers/Edwards.PDF-http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/rconley/conferencepapers/Edwards.PDF

Passing legislation was even more difficult on the divisive domestic issues that remained on Congress~’s 
AND
tenets of their ideology solely in deference to a widely supported chief executive.

====Strong Congressional support for fusion research====
**Rowberg 00** – Richard E., Senior Specialist in Science and Technology in the Resources, Science, and Industry Division – CRS, &amp;#34;Congress and the Fusion Energy Sciences Program: A Historical Analysis&amp;#34;, Congressional Research Service Report, 1-31, http://fire.pppl.gov/RL30417.pdf

In the 1990s, Congress maintained its support of the goals of the fusion program 
AND
advances in plasma science and engineering and the production of many highly trained scientists and engineers.

====Energy focus outweighs budget concerns====
**Rowberg 00** – Richard E., Senior Specialist in Science and Technology in the Resources, Science, and Industry Division – CRS, &amp;#34;Congress and the Fusion Energy Sciences Program: A Historical Analysis&amp;#34;, Congressional Research Service Report, 1-31, http://fire.pppl.gov/RL30417.pdf

6. Federal budget constraints.
Throughout the past 42 years, Congress has on a number of occasions stated that 
AND
nation~’s energy problems, may override those constraints to some degree.

====Fiat solves the link —- it~’s instant —- no political effect====

====DoE does the plan —- that~’s 1AC Miller —- shields the link====
**Schoenbrod 93** – David, Professor of Law – New York Law School, Adjunct Scholar – Cato Institute and Former Staff Attorney and Co-Director – Project on Urban Transportation, Power Without Responsibility, p. 9-10

Delegation, Like Budget Deficits, Hides Costs 
Delegation can shield our elected lawmakers from blame for harming the public not only when 
AND
by which a politician can appear to kiss both sides of the apple.&amp;#34;

====Not intrinsic —- do the plan and pass _____________________________________.====

====Winners win====
**Halloran 10** – Liz, Reporter – NPR, &amp;#34;For Obama, What A Difference A Week Made&amp;#34;, National Public Radio, 4-6, http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=125594396

Amazing what a win in a major legislative battle will do for a president~’s spirit
AND
can reverse what the polls now suggest is a losing issue for them. 

====Fission incentives now====
**Goodman 12** – Amy, Award Winning Journalist – The Guardian and Host – Democracy Now%21, &amp;#34;Big Nuclear~’s Cosy Relationship with the Obama Administration&amp;#34;, The Guardian, 3-8, http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/-http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/ cifamerica/2012/mar/08/big-nuclear-cosy-relationship-obama-administration

This is mind-boggling, on the first anniversary of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, with the chair of the US Nuclear Regulatory 
AND

===Yes Spinoffs===

====Prefer fusion-specific evidence====
**Smith 8** (C.H. Llewellyn Smith- former Director-General of CERN 2008, &amp;#34; The use of basic science: Benefits of basic science&amp;#34; http://public.web.cern.ch/public/en/about/BasicScience3-en.html~~%23b3-http://public.web.cern.ch/public/en/about/BasicScience3-en.html)

It is, however, certainly fair to argue that the value of the spin

===Non-Grant CP – A2: Prizes – Ext – Fails===

====Private funding crushes fusion research====
**Razani 12** (Rezwan, Executive Director – Focus Fusion Society, &amp;#34;Fusion Finance Conversation:  An Invitation&amp;#34;, Fusion Energy League, 4-14, http://www.fusionenergyleague.org/index.php/blog/article/f usion_finance_conversatio-http://www.fusionenergyleague.org/index.php/blog/article/f usion_finance_conversation_invitation)

Private Sector Inroads
Historically, the fusion program has received practically all of its funding from government 
AND
innovation and exchange of information with other fusion projects (stochastic and isolating).

====Fails, delays, and undermines certainty====
**Macauley 4** – Molly Macauley, Resources for the Future, 2004, Testimony before House Committee on Science, &amp;#34;NASA Prizes&amp;#34;, July 15, http://www.rff.org/Documents/RFF_CTs_04_macauley.pdf-http://www.rff.org/Documents/RFF_CTs_04_macauley.pdf

Much of the preceding discussion has emphasized the historical success of prizes but they have some disadvantages.  These include:
AND
 range of capacities is available in space transportation by dividing business among companies that offer different classes of vehicle lift).

====Predictable funding stream~’s critical to fusion research====
**SPIE 12** (International Society for Optics and Photonics, &amp;#34;The U.S. is Losing the Race&amp;#34;, http://spie.org/Documents/AboutSPIE/PDF/LongTermFunding.pdf)

While SPIE believes that we must begin to reduce the deficit and begin to live within our means, we must do so without

in economically critical areas such as nanotechnology, high-end computing, energy generation, and fusion energy science.

====Can~’t solve research —- stable, up-front cash flow~’s critical====
**Kalil 6** (Thomas, Special Assistant to the Chancellor for Science and Technology – University of California,  Berkeley, &amp;#34;Prizes for Technological Innovation&amp;#34;, December, http://www.brookings.edu/views/papers/200612kalil.pdf)

Although prizes should play a larger role in science and technology policy, they also have limitations and raise some legitimate concerns.
AND
not a substitute for stable, long-term support for fundamental research.

===Ext. ICE Thumper===

====ICE releases stop CIR passage- perception and trust====
**USA Today, 3-14**-2013 http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/03/14/more-than-2200-detainees-released/1989553/-http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/03/14/more-than-2200-detainees-released/1989553/

Whether a president has the power to generate a tide of public sentiment remains a

Contention One
Contention One is the WIPP:
Yucca’s done – waste’s headed to Carlsbad

Davenport 2-24
(2013 – Coral Davenport is the energy and environment correspondent for National Journal. Prior to joining National Journal in 2010, Davenport covered energy and environment for Congressional Quarterly. National Journal – February 24, 2013 – http://www.nationaljournal.com/magazine/nuclear-waste-in-the-age-of-climate-change-2013022)
Scientists determined long ago that the best place to store nuclear waste was not on
AND
Mountain, their bill appears to have strong prospects on the Senate floor.

Carlsbad’s “WIPP” plant stands to become A REPOSITORY and receive the 1st spent fuel shipments.

Plumer ‘12
(not Arizona Cardinal great Jake “the Snake” Plummer – but Brad Plumer, a former an associate editor at The New Republic that is now reporting on energy and environmental issues for the Washington Post – Washington Post’s Wonkblog Section – 06/13/2012 – http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/post/what-new-mexico-can-teach-us-about-storing-nuclear-waste/2012/06/13/gJQAxyEJaV_blog.html)
Recently, a 15-member blue-ribbon commission set up by Obama to 
AND
deep inside a geological repository for centuries. That’s a more daunting task.

(Note for student clarification: “WIPP” stands for “Waste Isolation Pilot 
AND
argument is that post-Yucca, it will start to do so.) 

Other nations struggle with disposal. WIPP’s a bad geologic setting.

Snow ‘4
Dr. David Snow; PhD: Engineering Science University of California-Berkeley; “UNSAFE RADWASTE DISPOSAL AT WIPP” – November 2004 – http://www.cardnm.org/nonkarstfrm_a.html

In nature, humans are largely shielded from radiation by rocks overlying the uranium ore
AND
by subsidence or oil-field water- flooding (Bredehoeft, 1997).

WIPP sets bad global precedent for waste. Seen as a short-cut. 

ABRAMS ‘98
NANCY E. ABRAMS has worked for Congressional Office of Technology Assessment. She is currently a lawyer specializing in developing new procedures for democratic resolution of technological problems. She has served as a consultant for the Swedish government. “Nuclear Waste Disposal: An Independent View of the Big Picture and a Proposal for CARD” – Presented at the 1998 conference of Citizens for Alternatives to Radioactive Dumping. Carlsbad NM – http://physics.ucsc.edu/~joel/AbramsPrimack/NuclearWasteDisposal.pdf

Methods to isolate nuclear waste successfully from the biosphere for the long term can be 
AND
unequally informed and unequally interested citizens can deal responsibly with such a decision.

Post-Yucca, the world’s curious if US handles waste on the cheap. WIPP’s cheap, plan’s ambitious.

Freidberg ‘9
(et al; JEFFREY FREIDBERG, Professor of Nuclear Science and Engineering Emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
NATURE PHYSICS; VOL 5; JUNE 2009 – http://web.mit.edu/fusion-fission/HybridsPubli/nphys1288.pdf)
Despite this demand and the advances made in the safety and design of fission reactors
AND
for transuranic military wastes quite effectively at the WIPP facility in New Mexico.

Yes, WIPP key to signal. Seemingly-minor waste policies matter. Impact’s a proactive decision-model that’s key to health of all humanity. 

ABRAMS ‘98
NANCY E. ABRAMS has worked for Congressional Office of Technology Assessment. She is currently a lawyer specializing in developing new procedures for democratic resolution of technological problems. She has served as a consultant for the Swedish government. “Nuclear Waste Disposal: An Independent View of the Big Picture and a Proposal for CARD” – Presented at the 1998 conference of Citizens for Alternatives to Radioactive Dumping. Carlsbad NM – http://physics.ucsc.edu/~joel/AbramsPrimack/NuclearWasteDisposal.pdf

This last principle needs some explanation. Nuclear waste itself may not be of cosmic 
AND
tremendous value would be to zero in on what that question should be.

(Note: the acronym “C.A.R.D.” stands-for “Citizens for Alternatives to Radioactive Dumping”. It is an organization in Carlsbad, New Mexico)

Global waste and US on-site storage cause systemic deaths for individuals and large collective genomic death tolls 

Olson ‘95
(This Mary Olson is not one of the Olsen twins, does not name a twin named Ashley and doesn’t have an exciting, fresh cosmetics line at Wal-Mart. Mary Olson is the Director of the Southeast Office for the Nuclear Information and Resource Service. She has a B.A. from Reed College, with a double major in Biology and History of Science, and subsequent study in chemistry and biochemistry at Purdue University.

Reports of increased incidence of human cancers and diseases, particularly in children, as 
AND
the deaths of people who are in the communities that host nuclear sites.



Texas often runs the complexity K of linear thought. We think they mischaracterize it. Bad linear thinking means “cook the meal twice the temperature and it’ll be done twice as fast”. Aff predictions are NON-LINEAR thought – we don’t know which straw will break the camel’s back. Yes, WIPP and radiation are COMPLEX – so VOTE AFF to err on the side of caution. 

EnvrioLeaks – quoting Dr. Snow – ‘11
(“Analysis: WIPP Is No Safe Haven For Nuclear Materials” – Dr. David Snow; PhD: Engineering Science University of California-Berkeley. EnviroLeaks is a repository of leaked information that fills the gap between what the mainstream media allow us to know about the environmentally destructive behaviour of the industrial system, and the often highly classified and largely political information from groups such as WikiLeaks. It also provides commentary on and analysis of relevant leaks from other sources. EnviroLeaks encourages ordinary people with access to embarrassing and potentially disruptive information, to submit it for review, with the intention of it being published as a publicly accessible article. This may take anywhere between a few days and a few months depending on the level of verification needed, and the nature of the information: sometimes a leak will be prioritised in order to increase the potential impact. January 21, 2011 – http://enviroleaks.org/2011/01/21/analysis-wipp-is-no-safe-haven-for-nuclear-materials/)

The relevance of this video, and the record of underground nuclear testing at Carlsbad 
AND
inadvertent interceptions of the waste rooms by future drill holes are very credible.

Release of radiation at WIPP would be bad:

Why not have High Level Waste and Spent Nuclear Fuel?¶ In addition to the 
AND
the surface, if a pathway is created by mining or other means.



Contention Two
Contention  Two – On-site 

First –There’s A LOT of on-site waste. It’s bad and stored-poorly. 

Pentland ‘12
(William Pentland is distinctly multidisciplinary and quite qualified. Attended journalism school at Columbia University and law school at Stanford University. He has written about energy and environmental issues for Forbes, The Nation, Mother Jones and several other publications. He is the Chair of the Northeast Clean Heat and Power Initiative. He also practiced law in New York City at Paul Weiss Rifkind Garrison and Wharton, LLP and Jenner and Block, LLP. “Nuclear Power&amp;#39;s Long and Toxic Tail” – Forbes – Sept 15th – http://www.forbes.com/sites/williampentland/2012/09/15/nuclear-powers-long-and-toxic-tail/)

Ironically, the United States, which is preparing to build a small but significant 
AND
cause long term health hazards, such as cancer,” the GAO concluded.

Second – we already read two big waste impacts – Olson

Third – “What does the Neg do about the waste” ?
Devolving framework back to a room in Ogden doesn’t teach responsible answers to that question. In the waste context, abstraction teaches abdication.  

Cairns ‘6
(David Cairns is Parliamentary Under-Secretary, Scotland Office; for Inverclyde. Inverclyde is one of 32 council areas used for government in Scotland. He is a former Parliamentary Official – Article title: “Nuclear Waste (Scotland)” – HC Deb, 19 June 2006, c1167 – available at: http://www.theyworkforyou.com/debate/?id=2006-06-19b.1167.0)

The First Minister is showing leadership in tackling the issue and not running away from 
AND
a duty to deal with that issue in order to protect future generations&amp;#34;.

Here’s four reasons we solve and that Neg args don’t apply to this version: 
One– As we learn, plan eats current waste and does so on-site.
Two – If there’s new waste, it’s WAY safer. 

Fin ‘12
(Al – frequent author and contributor to Oil Price. internally quoting experts employed at the University of Texas-Austin. The sections of the evidence we cite specifically reference Professor Swadesh Mahajan, Professor at the University of Texas-Austin where he works for the Institute for Fusion Studies.

The problem of radioactive waste, along with safety anxieties among the public, has 
AND
waste would be a boon in the U.S. and elsewhere.


Three– We don’t need to reach full commercial-fusion. We’re a hybrid spinoff  that arrives faster 

Mahajan ‘10
(Professor Swadesh Mahajan, Professor at the University of Texas-Austin where he works for the Institute for Fusion Studies. “Science Interviews: The Super X Divertor” – The Naked Scientist – The Naked Scientists are a group of physicians and researchers from Cambridge University who use radio, live lectures, and the Internet to promote science to the general public.

Swadesh - Typically, what you have is superheated plasma, as you said, 
AND
heat and particle fluxes which a high power density compact machine will produce. 

Root cause wouldn’t ever matter. Plan quickly eats waste and solves repositories. 

Science 2.0 in ‘9
(from the News Staff of Science 2.0. Science 2.0 is far more qualified than the name may suggest. It draws upon world-class scientists and graduate students and uses the internet to bring science to a wider audience. Science 2.0’s work has been mentioned in Science Magazine and Scientific American. This card is ALSO internally quoting Mike Kotschenreuther, senior research scientist with the Institute for Fusion Studies (IFS) and Department of Physics at the University of Texas-Austin. From the article: “Fusion-Fission Hybrid Could Make Nuclear Power Truly Green” – January 27th – http://www.science20.com/news_releases/fusionfission_hybrid_could_make_nuclear_power_truly_green)

A new invention could drastically decrease the need for any additional or expanded geological repositories
AND
product of fusion-neutrons-can be achieved in the near term.





Contention Three 
Contention Three is Isotopes
Fusion creates knowledge and cross-sector spillover. Causes neutron production for medical research

Nuclear fusion energy is produced by combining light atoms (deuturium or tritium - heavy isotopes of hydrogen) in a fusion reactor. Unfortunately, this form of energy is still in the research and development stage and is at least 50 years away from becoming a practical energy source. Its advantage lies in the vast amounts of hydrogen that lie in the Earth&amp;#39;s oceans, which can supply anticipated global energy needs for centuries to come.
This excludes electricity distribution
Touran 12 (Nick, Ph.D. in Nuclear Engineering – University of Michigan, “Power Basics (Terminology)”, http://www.whatisnuclear.com/physics/power_basics.html)

Before embarking on a meaningful discussion of nuclear power, we should touch base on the difference between power and energy, and some other terminology.

Energy is measured in Joules. A ton of wood might have 18 billion Joules 
AND

Power lingo in the electric industry
Rather than the standard units of Joules, electric companies bill by the kilowatt-hour, as you can see by looking at your most recent utility bill. This is just another measure of energy, akin to the Joule. 1 kW-hr is the amount of energy used if it is pulled at 1000 Watts for 1 hour. If you convert hours to seconds, you’ll find that this is equivalent to 3.6 million Joules.

EIA 99 – Energy Information Administration / Federal Energy Market Interventions 1999: Primary Energy, “3. Federal Energy Research and Development”, http://www.eia.gov/oiaf/servicerpt/subsidy/pdf/research.pdf)

Research and Development Defined
Federal energy-related RandD can be described as falling into three classes: basic research, research that seeks to develop new energy technologies, and research that seeks to improve existing technologies.
• Basic Research. The potential beneficiaries of basic research could be considered to be the population of the United States or the world as a whole. Basic research includes research projects designed to pursue the advancement of scientific knowledge and the understanding of phenomena rather than specific applications.
• Research To Develop New Technologies. The efforts in this context involve attempts to discover new scientific knowledge that can have commercial application. Although the end objective of the research is known, the research task is difficult and uncertain.
• Research To Improve Existing Technologies. These efforts emphasize the use of scientific knowledge to design and test new processes that may have substantial technical and cost uncertainties. The immediate beneficiaries are generally well defined: current producers and consumers of particular fuels or operators, and customers of the technology being improved.
Energy Research and Development as a Subsidy
It is easier to measure energy RandD spending than to it characterize from a subsidy perspective. RandD spending is intended to create useful knowledge that benefits society. Thus, all Federal RandD spending could, in a general way, be considered a subsidy to knowledge; however, the extent to which specific RandD programs actually affect energy markets is more difficult to ascertain.
The results of research are inherently uncertain. Many programs will advance knowledge across a 
AND
likely to be measurable only years after the funded research effort is initiated.
Federal RandD is intended to support research that the private sector would not 
AND
the program will be a substitute for private-sector RandD.
There are no means to determine conclusively whether or not particular Federal energy Rand
AND
historical perspective on the changing composition of Federal energy RandD efforts.
There is another issue that is specific to U.S. energy Rand
AND
technology adoption, and considering the competitive consequences of any new technologies introduced.
Finally, much of the expenditure that is formally defined as “energy research and 
AND
spending may not have a material impact on current or future energy markets.
Energy Research and Development Trends

AND
, the balance of this chapter focuses on applied energy RandD.

AND
, prepared in early 1997, which show final appropriations by budget account.

AND

Figure 3 illustrates trends in Federal applied energy RandD appropriations from fiscal year 
AND
oil and gas is budgeted at $164 million in fiscal year 1999.
Another recent trend in Federal RandD is a tendency for Congress to mandate 
AND
energy sources, including nuclear power, end use, and renewable energy.
Nuclear Power
Figure 4 illustrates trends in DOE’s nuclear power RandD programs. DOE received an appropriation of $640 million for nuclear RandD in fiscal year 1999, but the majority of the funds ($466.6 million) are allocated to the cleanup of contaminated nuclear energy and research sites. About two-thirds of the cleanup funds are being used for site closures, and the balance is slated for site and project completion.
Non-Defense Environmental Safety and Health
A substantial portion of Government-funded nuclear RandD is for managing and addressing the environmental legacy resulting from nuclear energy and research activities. The goal is to clean up as many contaminated sites as possible by 2006. For fiscal year 1999, more than one-half of nondefense environmental, safety, and health funds are allocated for site closures.
Improving Existing Power Plants and Enhancing Nuclear Power
The Nuclear Energy Research Initiative provides funds for RandD at universities, national laboratories, and industry to advance nuclear power technology. It includes proliferation-resistant reactor and fuel technologies, highperformance, high-efficiency reactor technology, advanced nuclear fuels, and new technologies for the minimization and management of nuclear waste. The fiscal year 1999 appropriation for this program is $19 million, out of the $30 million for new or improved nuclear power plants.

Ironically, the United States, which is preparing to build a small but significant

Second – we already read two big waste impacts – Olson

Third – &amp;#34;What does the Neg do about the waste&amp;#34; ?

Development of a compact, non-fission trigger poses a significant technical challenge – requiring vast sums of money and significant political commitment.
Nevertheless, fusion research is proceeding. Experiments are currently being conducted in at least 17 nations, with one of two goals:
1. Harnessing fusion for electrical power generation;
2. Replicating conditions of a nuclear explosion at the moment of detonation to test for warhead reliability.
Regardless of intent, this research could unlock the key to achieving compact, non-fission &amp;#34;ignition&amp;#34; of thermonuclear fuel – paving the way for possible FGNW development.

Double-bind – either their framework is incredibly narrow and about prisons… or the framework~’s about the whole the USFG and they have zero ev defending their pedagogical starting points. Reject it on-face. 


And – We~’ll straight turn their pedagogical starting points.

First – Rodriguez bases pedagogy on Freire:

**Rodriguez ~’10**
Dylan Rodriguez – D Rod will make ya jump – Radical Teacher, number 88, summer 2010 

As a pedagogical tool, this framework compels students and teachers to examine how deeply 
AND
at least momentarily) to become intimate and familiar with the allegedly impossible. 

That pedagogy ensures domination.

**Bowers ~’5 **
(C.A. Bowers, &amp;#34;Is Transformative Learning the Trojan Horse of Western Globalization?&amp;#34; Journal of Transformative Education 2005; 3; 116, http://jtd.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/3/2/116)
And one of the primary characteristics of this political language, which I earlier identified 
AND
ways that address issues related to the diversity of the world~’s cultural commons.  




2AC – Revolution Alts Fail
Look deeply at Alt centered on &amp;#34;Revolution&amp;#34;. They consistently fail and cause atrocity.

**HALLIDAY ~’3**
Fred IR @ London School of Economics ~’3 &amp;#34;Finding the Revolutionary in Revolution&amp;#34; in The Future of Revolutions ed. John Foran p 306-309
A second issue central to discussion of revolution today is that of the historic legacy 
AND
they are not a serious answer to the problems of the contemporary world. 

===Turns to Political Ontology – Black unity===

We K the whole notion of &amp;#34;political ontology&amp;#34; as it relates to race. It discourages black unity – it~’s net worse.

**James ~’10**
(Michael James, Bucknell University Faculty, Contemporary Political Theory; Cultural and Ethnic Pluralism; Law and Legal Theory – Ph.D., Duke University – &amp;#34;The Political Ontology of Race&amp;#34; – APSA 2010 Annual Meeting Paper – available via: http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1643755)
The role of agency in the political ontology of race reveals another problem: the 
AND
by the political ontology of race than by the social or biological ontologies.

===State not Always Racist ===
Too sweeping to say working-through-State never counters racism – here~’s 7 concrete examples:

**Seligman ~’11**
Brad Seligman – Lead Counsel, Dukes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc – The nationwide class action gender
discrimination case against Wal-Mart Stores and founder of the Impact Fund, which provides financial and technical
assistance and representation for complex public interest litigation – Clearinghouse REVIEW Journal of Poverty Law and Policy – January–February 2011 – http://www.impactfund.org/downloads/Resources/UsingLawForChange-Seligman.pdf

Litigation as a tool for social change has a long and proud tradition in the

Contention one
On-site storage 

First –There’s A LOT of on-site waste. It’s bad and stored-poorly. 

Pentland ‘12
(William Pentland is distinctly multidisciplinary and quite qualified. Attended journalism school at Columbia University and law school at Stanford University. He has written about energy and environmental issues for Forbes, The Nation, Mother Jones and several other publications. He is the Chair of the Northeast Clean Heat and Power Initiative. He also practiced law in New York City at Paul Weiss Rifkind Garrison and Wharton, LLP and Jenner and Block, LLP. “Nuclear Power&amp;#39;s Long and Toxic Tail” – Forbes – Sept 15th – http://www.forbes.com/sites/williampentland/2012/09/15/nuclear-powers-long-and-toxic-tail/)

Ironically, the United States, which is preparing to build a …If not properly contained or shielded, the intense radioactivity of spent fuel can cause immediate deaths and environmental contamination and, in lower doses, cause long term health hazards, such as cancer,” the GAO concluded.


This systemically kills individuals and means large collective genomic death tolls 

Olson ‘95
(This Mary Olson is not one of the Olsen twins, does not name a twin named Ashley and doesn’t have an exciting, fresh cosmetics line at Wal-Mart. Mary Olson is the Director of the Southeast Office for the Nuclear Information and Resource Service. She has a B.A. from Reed College, with a double major in Biology and History of Science, and subsequent study in chemistry and biochemistry at Purdue University. NIRS publications – http://www.nirs.org/radiation/nwisolation_zeroradioactivity.pdf)

Reports of increased incidence of human cancers and diseases…. humans to their Sun God. Yet, here we are in the 20th century, living with regulations that condone the deaths of people who are in the communities that host nuclear sites.

Endorsing seemingly-minor waste policies matter. Impact is a proactive decision-making model that spillsover to tackle many issues.

ABRAMS ‘98
NANCY E. ABRAMS has worked for Congressional Office of Technology Assessment. She is currently a lawyer specializing in developing new procedures for democratic resolution of technological problems. She has served as a consultant for the Swedish government. “Nuclear Waste Disposal: An Independent View of the Big Picture and a Proposal for CARD” – Presented at the 1998 conference of Citizens for Alternatives to Radioactive Dumping. Carlsbad NM – http://physics.ucsc.edu/~joel/AbramsPrimack/NuclearWasteDisposal.pdf

This last principle needs some explanation… in on what that question should be.

(Note: the acronym “C.A.R.D.” stands-for “Citizens for Alternatives to Radioactive Dumping”. It is an organization in Carlsbad, New Mexico)

Root cause wouldn’t ever matter. Plan quickly burns present waste as fuel

Science 2.0 in ‘9
(from the News Staff of Science 2.0. Science 2.0 is far more qualified than the name may suggest. It draws upon world-class scientists and graduate students and uses the internet to bring science to a wider audience. Science 2.0’s work has been mentioned in Science Magazine and Scientific American. This card is ALSO internally quoting Mike Kotschenreuther, senior research scientist with the Institute for Fusion Studies (IFS) and Department of Physics at the University of Texas-Austin. From the article: “Fusion-Fission Hybrid Could Make Nuclear Power Truly Green” – January 27th – http://www.science20.com/news_releases/fusionfission_hybrid_could_make_nuclear_power_truly_green)

A new invention could drastically … physicists say that harnessing the other product of fusion-neutrons-can be achieved in the near term.

First of all, the past and ongoing activities in the areas of basic science and … investments in Fusion RandD will have a positive impact on the technological progress in the related industries. Moreover, if Fusion proves to be economically competitive, accordingly its commercialisation will spur further advancements in underlying technologies leading to the expansion of their markets and allowing for decreasing overall technology costs.

Spinoff feasible in the short-term

VIII. CONCLUDING REMARKS¶ The inescapable conclusion of this paper is …the present image that &amp;#34;fusion is always decades away&amp;#34; and that may cost billions of dollars before they produce results.
Medical isotope supply crunch is happening now – causes 20 million systemic deaths a year and forces a shift to worse radioactive scans

Science Daily, “Worldwide Shortage of Isotopes for Medical Imaging Could Threaten Quality of Patient Care”, 8-23, http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/08/100822104822.htm
¶ Twenty million medical scans and treatments are done each … cancer has spread to the bones,&amp;#34; Atcher said. &amp;#34;Doctors have been trying everything they can think of to meet the needs of patients, including the use of other less-than-ideal isotopes, but it has been a real struggle.&amp;#34;

We’re not pro-State, but we’re “anti-anti State”. Some things can ONLY be solved “through the system” – and lifting existing State-exclusions on fusion are such an issue:

This fits well with our conception of ironic curriculum, in … to challenge the vocabulary of civics education.

And, if the debate winds-up a “tie”, presumption should shift in favor of change – best avoids nihilism. 



Our politics advances a valuable lesson. We need to learn the apparatus of government OPERATION. Crucial to avoid ceding politics and checking the worst violence.

(Jonathan, former Americorps VISTA for the Human Services Coalition,  “Moving Forward,” The Journal for Civic Commitment,  Spring, http://www.mc.maricopa.edu/other/engagement/Journal/Issue7/Small.jsp)
What will be the challenges of the new millennium? And … these systems, and by systems we mean government and commerce, have the potential for positive change. Civic engagement consequently takes on a more specific and political meaning in this context.  


Even if “fiat is not real”, and the Aff does not control levers of power today, we avoid a curriculum that teaches the most dangerous nihilism. 

Hoff ‘6 
(et al, Dr. Dianne Hoff, professor in the College of Education and Human Development and president of Faculty Senate, University of Maine, Journal of Educational Administration, 44:3 – available via Emerald Management 120 database).

There is no question that helping educational leadership students … set up a level playing field for the arena of ideas and beliefs. This is an arena from which a new social order can emerge.

One of the central departures of critical international theory from positivism is the view that we cannot escape the interpretive moment. As George (1994: 24) argues, ‘the world is always an interpreted “/// discourses, and if making ‘small-t’ truth claims is inevitable if one is to talk about how the world works, then it is no more likely that constructivism per se violates the interpretive ethos of critical international theory than does critical theory itself.

Our model turns this – Hart ev says privileging of local experience over field expertise in medical public policy issues encourages inaccurate and short cited conclusions that results in deadly conclusions and empirically disproportionately blocks black access to life saving medicines

Isotopes – Eugenics Add-On
They dropped the isotopes we create solve screening and understanding genes. That’s Lucignani. 
And, genome info checks eugenics. Any Neg spin is backwards. We avoids non-genomic starting points that are MORE RACIST.

Findings for High-Initiative Conventional Policy Behavior… strong sense of effi- cacy (.29). Another way to look at the same rela- tionship is to observe the results of ANOVA. The F value for interactive effects (low trust-high sense of internal efficacy) among the poor (F = 14.326) is statistically significant; the F value for the non-poor (F = 0.217) is not.

(Jeffery, Professor of Political Science at Indiana University, Dissent, Vol. 49 No. 2, Spring)
Politics, in large part, involves contests over the distribution and use of power. To accomplish anything in the political world one must attend to the means that are necessary to bring it about. And to develop such means is to develop, and to exercise, power. To say this is not to say that power is beyond morality. It is to say that power is not reducible to morality. As writers such as Niccolo Machiavelli, Max Weber, Reinhold Niebuhr, Hannah Arendt have taught, an … THIS judgment. It alienates those who are not true believers. It promotes arrogance. And it undermines political effectiveness.

One of the most disquieting uses of this logic in ,,,. I have addressed this theoretical violence as the ‘‘logic of the soccer match’’ because its metaphorical recycling of culpability and victimization replicates the circulation of innocence and guilt that we see in the soccer match between the SS and SK at the gates of the Auschwitz crematorium.

Critical theory is not only an anti-positivistic attack against neutral, ‘pure’ knowledge. It also proposes some critical knowledge to transform the world. In opposition to ‘traditional science’ which is associated with the interests of elites, states, and other dominant groups and institutions, critical knowledge is made up and … person of the theoretician; he/she exercises an aggressive critique not only against the conscious defenders of the status quo but also against distracting, conformist, or utopian tendencies within his/her own household.
