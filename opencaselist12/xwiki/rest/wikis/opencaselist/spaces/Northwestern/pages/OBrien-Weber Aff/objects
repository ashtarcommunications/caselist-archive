===Plan===

====The United States federal government should lower antidumping tariffs on crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells from the People~’s Republic of China.====

===China===

====Advantage 1 is China====

====US solar tariffs threaten to start a clean energy trade war====
**Tucker 8/27**/12, William, work has appeared in Harper~’s, the Atlantic Monthly, the American Spectator, the Weekly Standard, National Review, Reason, the New Republic, Reader~’s Digest, the Wall Street Journal, and many other publications, &amp;#34;Let~’s Just Admit Solar Needs Help and Avoid Trade War&amp;#34;, [[http://www.nucleartownhall.com/blog/william-tucker-let%E2%80%99s-just-admit-solar-needs-help-and-avoid-trade-war/-http://www.nucleartownhall.com/blog/william-tucker-let%E2%80%99s-just-admit-solar-needs-help-and-avoid-trade-war/]]
Although the newspapers haven~’t been paying much attention lately, the United States and China 
AND
this will make for good old clean-and-green solar power.

====Now is key – solar spills over and escalates within months====
**Bloomberg 9/5** ~~[Bloomberg News, &amp;#34;China Speeding U.S. Solar-Dumping Case as Election Nears: Energy,&amp;#34; http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-05/china-speeding-u-s-solar-dumping-case-as-election-nears-energy.html~~]
China is accelerating a dispute with the U.S. over solar-energy 
AND
solar projects rose 61 percent to %24137.8 billion last year.

====Strategic value of renewables makes this conflict uniquely likely to escalate====
**Beijing Review 9/3**/12 ~~[Citing Li Chunding, Ph.D. in Economics, research assistant at the Institute of World Economics and Politics at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, &amp;#34;Frictions over renewable energy,&amp;#34; http://www.china.org.cn/business/2012-09/03/content_26410601.htm~~]
A month after the United States launched the anti-dumping and countervailing investigations against 
AND
is not likely to make a compromise on trade frictions in this sector.¶ 

====Trade war causes US-China military conflict====
**Landy 7** ~~[Ben Landy, Director of Research and Strategy at the Atlantic Media Company, publisher of the Atlantic Monthly, National Journal, and Government Executive magazines.   Landy served in various research and project management positions at the Brookings Institution and Center for Strategic and International Studies, two leading public policy think tanks in Washington, D.C.  Ben holds a bachelor of arts degree from Yale University.

The greatest threat for the 21st century is that these economic flare-ups between 
AND
–far more than increases in military budgets and anti-satellite tests.

====That causes nuclear world war 3====
**Hunkovic 9** – American Military University ~~[Lee J, 2009, &amp;#34;The Chinese-Taiwanese Conflict: Possible Futures of a Confrontation between China, Taiwan and the United States of America&amp;#34;, http://www.lamp-method.org/eCommons/Hunkovic.pdf~~]
A war between China, Taiwan and the United States has the potential to escalate 
AND
outcome, therefore, other countries will not be considered in this study.

====An escalated U.S. China trade war results in economic conflicts and devastating protectionism ====
**Wang and Li 11** (Jianhua and Yunlu—Xinhua news agency, citing Ni Feng, Vice President of the Institute of American Studies underthe Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, Zhao Jinping, vice director of the Foreign Economic Department of the Development Research Center (DRC) of the State Council &amp;#34;China-US trade war no good for anyone&amp;#34;, October 13, 2011. http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90780/7616581.html 
A trade war between the United States and China, each of which is the 
AND
and will even lead to political and military confrontations in some sensitive regions. 

====That causes world war====

Continuing calls for curbs on the flow of finance and trade will inspire the United 
AND
between Muslims and Western societies as the beginnings of a new world war.

====Most recent studies provide a direct connection between poor economic relations and military conflict====
**Royal 10** – Jedediah Royal, Director of Cooperative Threat Reduction at the U.S. Department of Defense, 2010, &amp;#34;Economic Integration, Economic Signaling and the Problem of Economic Crises,&amp;#34; in Economics of War and Peace: Economic, Legal and Political Perspectives, ed. Goldsmith and Brauer, p. 213-215
Less intuitive is how periods of economic decline may increase the likelihood of external conflict
AND
such, the view presented here should be considered ancillary to those views.

====The tariff prevents clean energy cooperation====
**AP 5/19**/12 ~~[&amp;#34;Ruling adds to China trade tension: POSSIBLE U.S. TARIFFS ON SOLAR-PANEL IMPORTS MAY THREATEN CLEAN ENERGY COOPERATION,&amp;#34; [[http://www.stltoday.com/business/local/ruling-adds-to-china-trade-tension/article_c7071e82-78b7-5d95-b943-a8c6e5cc93de.html-http://www.stltoday.com/business/local/ruling-adds-to-china-trade-tension/article_c7071e82-78b7-5d95-b943-a8c6e5cc93de.html]]~~]
POSSIBLE U.S. TARIFFS ON SOLAR-PANEL IMPORTS MAY THREATEN CLEAN ENERGY 
AND
trade probe have warned China might retaliate against U.S. suppliers.

====That~’s key to global clean tech diffusion====
**Lin 11** ~~[Justin Yifu Lin, Former World Bank Chief Economist and Senior Vice President, &amp;#34;China, the US and clean energy cooperation,&amp;#34; Jan 21 2011, http://blogs.worldbank.org/developmenttalk/china-the-us-and-clean-energy-cooperation~~]
Second, there are also major long-term global benefits from clean energy cooperation between the U.S. and China.  Costs of clean energy investment would fall throughout the world, making such investment more financially sustainable.  Clean energy is also a crucial part of providing energy access to better meet basic needs, to enhance growth, and to reduce poverty. 
Making clean energy more available and more affordable won~’t be easy. It entails making new and improved low-carbon technologies more cost-competitive on a global scale, and supporting developing countries as they strive to expand energy availability. Here, the capacities in both China and the U.S. for innovation and increased diffusion of clean energy technology come to the fore. 

====Specifically derails the diffusion of solar====
**Green 11**, 12-19, Martin, executive research director at the Photovoltaics Centre of Excellence at the University of New South Wales in Australia, &amp;#34;A Solar Trade War Could Put Us All in the Dark&amp;#34;, http://www.technologyreview.com/news/426392/a-solar-trade-war-could-put-us-all-in-the-dark/
The brewing solar trade war between the United States and China sullies what should be 
AND
decades of international innovation and stall the global adoption of advanced solar technology.

====The alternative is global war====
**Droege 2** ~~[Peter Droege, Asia Pacific chair of the World Council for Renewable Energy, Professor at the University of Liechtenstein and the University of Newcastle School of Architecture and Built Environment; &amp;#34;Renewable Energy and the City: Urban life in an age of fossil fuel depletion and climate change,&amp;#34; 23 Jan 2002, http://enviroscope.iges.or.jp/contents/13/data/PDF/WORD%20Pdf/9-1Droege_peter.pdf~~]
While a few local urban systems may seem relatively safe from a terminal fossil fuel 
AND
not the only threat to the survivability of the modern global urban system.

====The tariff undermines the Durban platform for stopping climate change====
**Barbier 12** (Edward B—the John S. Bugas Professor of Economics, University of Wyoming, &amp;#34;Can the US and China Cooperate over Climate and Clean Energy?&amp;#34;, May 28, 2012, http://chinausfocus.com/energy-environment/can-the-us-and-china-cooperate-over-climate-and-clean-energy/)
One of the few bright spots in recent international negotiations to replace the expiring 1997 
AND
undermines the fragile beginnings of US and China cooperation over global climate change.

====Durban is a crucial starting point for emission reductions – now is key====
**NewScientist 11**, &amp;#34;Dangerous decade: What follows the Durban climate deal&amp;#34;, 12-13, http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn21278-dangerous-decade-what-follows-the-durban-climate-deal.html
Time is running out. However successful the deal felt early on Sunday, the 
AND
close the ambition gap (see diagram), but nations must act now.

====Public debate is necessary to inform the public about the risks of protectionism====
Sungjoon **Cho**, Assistant Professor of Law, Chicago-Kent College of Law, Illinois Institute of Technology, Doha~’s Development, 25 Berkeley J. Int~’l L. 165, 200**7**, LN
In this regard, (public) ignorance is not bliss in the making of 
AND
global tariff wars that contributed to the outbreak of the Second World War.

===Domestic===

====Advantage 2 is Domestic Solar====

====Solar is approaching grid parity and widespread adoption in the US – the tariff derails that====

Cameron, Ph.D. in Economics and Senior Consultant for the Brattle Group; Judy Chang, economist with expertise in the analysis of electricity power markets and principal at the Brattle Group; &amp;#34;The Employment Impacts of Proposed Tariffs on Chinese Manufactured Photovoltaic Cells and Modules,&amp;#34; January 30 2012, http://coalition4affordablesolar.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/TBG_Solar-Trade-Impact-Report.pdf~~]
Average module prices in the U.S. are largely determined by Chinese imports
AND
the imposition of a 50% or 100% tariff on Chinese imports. 

====Frequent heat wave blackouts are coming now====
**Stone 8/8**/12 ~~[Brian Stone, Assistant Professor in the City and Regional Planning Program at the Georgia Institute of Technology, &amp;#34;Urban Heat Islands and Climate Change: Planning for Extreme Heat in Cities,&amp;#34; http://www.epa.gov/hiri/resources/transcripts/8_aug_2012-webcasttranscript-stone.pdf~~]
Most critical is your logical infrastructure. In 2003, the same year as the
