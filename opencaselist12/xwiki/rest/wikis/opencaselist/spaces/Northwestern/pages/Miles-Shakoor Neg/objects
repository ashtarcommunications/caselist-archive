Text: The United States Federal Government should deploy high altitude balloons to disperse sufficient titanium dioxide to counteract global warming

The United States Federal Government should substantially increase investment in smart microgrid technology for its domestic military installations via a diverse portfolio tailored to individual installation circumstances, including non-nuclear renewable energies for on-site generation, increased backup generation capacity, improvements in energy efficiency and energy storage, intelligent local energy management, and accelerated implementation of the SPIDERS project.

DOD is massively increasing efforts to ensure operational continuity~-~--means zero risk of mission interruption during a significant commercial grid outage

Chairman Lungren and distinguished Members of the Subcommittee.  Thank you for the opportunity to testify.  I was asked to address the question of how the Department of Defense (DoD) would operate during a significant outage of the commercial electric power grid.   
Although today’s hearing is focused on the prospect of an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) 
AND
its Installations and Environment office, falls under DoD’s “facility energy strategy.”  
Mission Assurance Strategy 
The Department has long had a major focus on mitigating risks to high priority DoD facilities and infrastructure and the critical global missions they support. Toward that end, DoD recently adopted an explicit Mission Assurance Strategy, which is focused on ensuring operational continuity in an all-hazard threat environment. 
This strategy entails a two-track approach. Track I includes &amp;#34;in-

The Department of Defense fully recognizes the strategic importance of mitigating the growing risks to the commercial electric power grid, and therefore, the Department is taking affirmative steps internally and externally. Senior leaders are re-focusing some of the Department’s energy security efforts. 
Although there are steps the Department can and should take on its own to improve

The Department of Defense is collaborating with the Department of Energy, the Department of

sponsored Secure Grid 2011 and the North American Electric Reliability Corporation’s GridEx 2011.
These partnerships will help the Department of Defense achieve greater energy grid security and resiliency and help mitigate the risks to critical Department of Defense installations and facilities of commercial power outages.   
Department of Defense Efforts Underway 
The Department of Defense is making organizational changes and capability improvements that address electric power reliability and security issues and that enable better risk-informed decision-making and investments. 
This year the Department of Defense submitted a report to Congress under Section 335 of

Hegemony invokes a permanent state of emergency that justifies our paranoid neurosis—the idea we need to deter invisible threats creates self-fulfilling prophecies makes war inevitable

Hard power not key to peace

EVERYONE talks about getting out of Iraq and Afghanistan. But what about Germany and Japan? 
The sequester — $85 billion this year in across-the-board budget cuts, about half of which will come from the Pentagon — gives Americans an opportunity to discuss a question we’ve put off too long: Why we are still fighting World War II? 
Since 1947, when President Harry S. Truman set forth a policy to stop further Soviet expansion and “support free peoples” who were “resisting subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures,” America has acted as the world’s policeman. 
For more than a century, Britain had “held the line” against aggression 
AND
its waterways. Stalin was strong-arming governments from Finland to Iran. 
Some historians say Truman scared the American people into a broad, open-ended commitment to world security. But Americans were already frightened: in 1947, 73 percent told Gallup that they considered World War III likely. 
From the Truman Doctrine emerged a strategy comprising multiple alliances: the Rio Pact of 
AND
we invented the practice of foreign aid, beginning with the Marshall Plan. 
It was a profound turn even from 1940, when Franklin D. Roosevelt won 
AND
into European conflicts the better for the United States and for the world.” 
World War II, and the relative impotence of the United Nations, convinced successive 
AND
, Afghanistan) but the world, as a whole, experienced fewer. 
We were not so much an empire — the empire decried by the scholar and veteran Andrew J. Bacevich and celebrated by the conservative historian Niall Ferguson — as an umpire, one that stood for equal access by nation-states to political and economic gains; peaceful arbitration of international conflict; and transparency in trade and business. 
But conditions have changed radically since the cold war. When the United States established major bases in West Germany and Japan, they were considered dangerous renegades that needed to be watched. Their reconstructed governments also desired protection, particularly from the Soviet Union and China. NATO’s first secretary general, Hastings Ismay, famously said the alliance existed “to keep the Russians out, the Americans in, and the Germans down.” 
Today, our largest permanent bases are still in Germany and Japan, which are 
AND
in the Pacific — speaks to the irrational endurance of the Truman Doctrine. 
Our wars in the Middle East since 2001 doubled down on that costly, outdated doctrine. The domino theory behind the Vietnam War revived under a new formulation: but for the American umpire, the bad guys (Al Qaeda, Iran, North Korea) will win. 
Despite his supporters’ expectations, President Obama has followed a Middle East policy nearly identical to his predecessor’s. He took us out of Iraq, only to deepen our commitment to Afghanistan, from which we are just now pulling out. He rejected the most odious counterterrorism techniques of George W. Bush’s administration, but otherwise did not change basic policies. Mr. Obama’s gestures toward multilateralism were not matched by a commensurate commitment from many of our allies. 
Cynics assert that the “military-industrial complex” Dwight D. Eisenhower presciently warned against has primarily existed to enrich and empower a grasping, imperialist nation. But America was prosperous long before it was a superpower; by 1890, decades before the two world wars, it was already the world’s largest and richest economy. We do not need a large military to be rich. Quite the opposite: it drains our resources. 
Realists contend that if we quit defending access to the world’s natural resources — read
AND
leaders. The Libyan crisis showed that our allies can do a lot. 
The United States can and should pressure Iran and North Korea over their nuclear programs. It must help to reform and strengthen multilateral institutions like the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. It must champion the right of small nations, including Israel, to “freedom from fear.” But there are many ways of achieving these goals, and they don’t all involve more borrowing and spending. 
Partisan debates that focus on shaving a percentage point off the Pentagon budget here or there won’t take us where we need to go. Both parties are stuck in a paradigm of costly international activism while emerging powers like China, India, Brazil and Turkey are accumulating wealth and raising productivity and living standards, as we did in the 19th century. The long-term consequences are obvious. 
America since 1945 has paid a price in blood, treasure and reputation. Umpires may be necessary, but they are rarely popular and by definition can’t win. Perhaps the other players will step up only if we threaten to leave the field. Sharing the burden of security with our allies is more than a fiscal necessity. It’s the sine qua non of a return to global normalcy.

Jungk elaborates on the routinisation of nuclear state violence, epistemological, juridical and physical:
Such measures will be justified, not as temporary measures made necessary by an exceptional emergency … but by the necessity of providing permanent protection for a perpetually endangered central source of energy that is regarded as indispensable. A nuclear industry means a permanent state of emergency justified by a permanent threat. (1979: 135)
This permanent state of emergency with respect to anything nuclear applies to restrictions on citizens’

Tech and adaptive advances prevent all climate impacts~-~--warming won’t cause war

Decades-long empirical trends of climate-sensitive measures of human well-being, including the percent of developing world population suffering from chronic hunger, poverty rates, and deaths due to extreme weather events, reveal dramatic improvement during the twentieth century, notwithstanding the historic increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations.
The magnitude of the impacts of climate change on human well-being depends on 
AND
will be present at the time for which impacts are to be estimated.
Even accepting the IPCC&amp;#39;s and Stern Review&amp;#39;s worst-case scenarios, and assuming a compounded annual growth rate of per-capita GDP of only 0.7 percent, reveals that net GDP per capita in developing countries in 2100 would be double the 2006 level of the U.S. and triple that level in 2200. Thus, even developing countries&amp;#39; future ability to cope with climate change would be much better than that of the U.S. today.
The IPCC&amp;#39;s embrace of biofuels as a way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions was premature, as many researchers have found &amp;#34;even the best biofuels have the potential to damage the poor, the climate, and biodiversity&amp;#34; (Delucchi, 2010). Biofuel production consumes nearly as much energy as it generates, competes with food crops and wildlife for land, and is unlikely to ever meet more than a small fraction of the world&amp;#39;s demand for fuels. 
The notion that global warming might cause war and social unrest is not only wrong, but even backwards - that is, global cooling has led to wars and social unrest in the past, whereas global warming has coincided with periods of peace, prosperity, and social stability.

In order to distinguish an exchange restriction from a trade measure, the Fund chose not to give relevance to the purposes or the effects of the measure and to adopt, instead, a technical criterion that focuses on the method followed to design said measure.&#xD;
An interpretation that considered the economic effects and purposes of the measures (taking into &#xD;

After lengthy discussions, in 1960 the IMF Executive Board adopted Decision No. 1034-(60/27).46 This Decision clarified that the distinctive feature of a restriction on payments and transfers for current international transactions is &amp;#34;whether it involves a direct governmental limitation on the availability or use of exchange as such*.47 This is a limitation imposed directly on the use of currency in itself, for all purposes.&#xD;

**Treanor %26 Sperling 93** William - Prof Law at Fordham. Gene - Deputy Assistant to President for Economic Policy. &amp;#34;PROSPECTIVE OVERRULING AND THE REVIVAL OF &amp;#34;UNCONSTITUTIONAL&amp;#34; STATUTES,&amp;#34; Columbia Law Review, Dec 93, lexis
Unlike the Supreme Court, several state courts have explicitly addressed the revival issue. The relevant state court cases have concerned the specific issue of whether a statute that has been held unconstitutional is revived when the invalidating decision is overturned. n42 With one exception, they have concluded that such statutes are immediately enforceable.
The most noted instance in which the revival issue was resolved by a court involved the District of Columbia minimum wage statute pronounced unconstitutional in Adkins. After the Court reversed Adkins in West Coast Hotel, President Roosevelt asked Attorney General Homer  ~~*1913~~  Cummings for an opinion on the status of the District of Columbia~’s statute. The Attorney General responded,
 The decisions are practically in accord in holding that the courts have no power to repeal or abolish a statute, and that notwithstanding a decision holding it unconstitutional a statute continues to remain on the statute books; and that if a statute be declared unconstitutional and the decision so declaring it be subsequently overruled the statute will then be held valid from the date it became effective. n43
Enforcement of the statute followed without congressional action. n44
When this enforcement was challenged, the Municipal Court of Appeals for the District of 
AND
decision is reversed the statute is valid from its first effective date. n46
 The court declared this precedent sound since the cases were &amp;#34;in accord with 
AND
a period judicially unenforceable, there was no need to reenact it. n49
Almost all other courts that have addressed the issue of whether a statute that has 
AND
rejecting this claim and in finding for the husband, the Court stated:
 Since we have declared the uniform court rule partially unconstitutional, it appears to 
AND
an assumption of legislative power not delegated to it by the Constitution. n52
 The Louisiana Court thus took a mechanical approach to the revival question. According to its rationale, when a statute is found unconstitutional, it is judicially determined never to have existed. Revival therefore entails judicial legislation and thereby violates constitutionally mandated separation of powers: because the initial legislative passage  ~~*1915~~  of the bill has no legitimacy, the bill~’s force is considered to be purely a creature of judicial decision-making.
Jefferson has little analytic appeal. Its view of the separation of powers doctrine is 
AND
a statute did not revive does not offer a convincing rationale for nonrevival.

====Their impact evidence is alarmist and empirically denied====
**Kaleita 7** Amy Kaleita is an Environmental Studies Fellow and Assistant Professor of agricultural and biosystems engineering at Iowa State University. She holds a PhD in agricultural engineering from the University of Illinois. &amp;#34;Hysteria~’s History: Environmental Alarmism in Context,&amp;#34; Pacific Research Institute, http://www.pacificresearch.org/docLib/20070920_Hysteria_History.pdf

Apocalyptic stories about the irreparable, catastrophic damage that humans are doing to the natural environment have been around for a long time. These hysterics often have some basis in reality, but are blown up to illogical and ridiculous proportions. Part of the reason they~’re so appealing is that they have the ring of plausibility along with the intrigue of a horror flick. 
In many cases, the alarmists identify a legitimate issue, take the possible consequences to an extreme, and advocate action on the basis of these extreme projections. In 1972, the editor of the journal Nature pointed out the problem with the typical alarmist approach: &amp;#34;~~Alarmists~’~~ most common error is to suppose that the worst will always happen.&amp;#34;82 But of course, if the worst always happened, the human race would have died out long ago. 
When alarmism has a basis in reality, the challenge becomes to take appropriate action based on that reality, not on the hysteria. The aftermath of Silent Spring offers examples of both sorts of policy reactions: a reasoned response to a legitimate problem and a knee-jerk response to the hysteria. 
On the positive side, Silent Spring brought an end to the general belief that 
AND
of their effect on soil, water, wildlife, and man himself.&amp;#34; 
Indeed, Carson seemed to advocate reasoned response to rigorous scientific investigation, and in 
AND
information is gathered through routine testing of chemicals for use in the environment. 
Ironically, rigorous investigation was not used in the decision to ban DDT, primarily 
AND
in the environment, without pronouncing a death sentence on millions of people. 
A major challenge in developing appropriate responses to legitimate problems is that alarmism catches people~’s attention and draws them in. Alarmism is given more weight than it deserves, as policy makers attempt to appease their constituency and the media. It polarizes the debaters into groups of &amp;#34;believers&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;skeptics,&amp;#34; so that reasoned, fact-based compromise is difficult to achieve. Neither of these aspects of alarmism is healthy for the development of appropriate policy. 
Further, alarmist responses to valid problems risk foreclosing potentially useful responses based on ingenuity 
AND
and favoring one particular replacement technology at the expense of other promising technologies. 
Environmental alarmism should be taken for what it is—a natural tendency of some portion of the public to latch onto the worst, and most unlikely, potential outcome. Alarmism should not be used as the basis for policy. Where a real problem exists, solutions should be based on reality, not hysteria.

====Hegemonic retrenchment~’s key to avoid great power war—-maintaining unipolarity~’s self-defeating which internal link-turns their offense ====
Nuno P. **Monteiro 12**, Assistant Professor of Political Science at Yale University, &amp;#34;Unrest Assured: Why Unipolarity is Not Peaceful,&amp;#34; International Security, Winter 2012, Vol. 36, No. 3, p. 9-40
From the perspective of the overall peacefulness of the international system, then, no 
AND
will continue for as long as U.S. power remains preponderant.
From the narrower perspective of the unipole~’s ability to avoid being involved in wars, 
AND
and a strategy of disengagement, which allows conflict between others to fester.
In a sense, then, strategies of defensive and offensive dominance are self-
AND
. ability to convert power into favorable outcomes peacefully will be constrained.117
This last point highlights one of the crucial issues where Wohlforth and I differ—
AND
preponderance, displaying the limited pacifying effects of U.S. power.
What, then, is the value of unipolarity for the unipole? What can 
AND
any event, the polarity of the system may become less important.&amp;#34;120
At the same time, nothing in my argument determines the decline of U.
AND
must acknowledge the possibility of frequent conflict in a nonetheless durable unipolar system.
Finally, my argument points to a &amp;#34;paradox of power preponderance.&amp;#34;121 By 
AND
peacefully. In effect, unparalleled relative power requires unequaled self-restraint.


====Attempting to preserve hegemony backfires—-causes counterbalancing and great power war ====

On major questions of global economy and security, interests, not ideology or an 
AND
human rights, democracy promotion, and to a lesser degree, development.
The result is a partial shift in the U.S. position. True
AND
Its influence, however, has to be wielded in a new mode. 
With today~’s power distribution, no one actor, and no one set of actors
AND
financial regulation, and with Russia and Europe on the management of Iran. 
No other state has anything like this range of tactical alliances available to them. 
AND
Nuclear Security Summit-but it was the United States that did so. 
This is a complex game, where the United States can no longer get its 
AND
others will look first to the largest minority shareholder to lead the way. 
But this comparative advantage cannot be overplayed. If the United States attempts to portray 
AND
less dominant position, the United States needs a new mindset about strategy. 
PART 2: IMPLICATIONS FOR U.S. STRATEGY AND INTERNATIONAL ORDER
That all of this matters can be illustrated by imagining the negative scenarios if the 
AND
grind to a halt, global trade and finance will begin to erode. 
Of course, the primary purpose of international order-to prevent major power war-is even more fundamental. But well short of active conflict between the major powers, mismanagement of the changing international system can pose tremendous costs for the United States and virtually everyone else. 
Avoiding a G-Zero scenario, a major power conflict, and continued high 
AND
complemented by frank debate, but not firm divides, on human rights. 
Fostering cooperation on global finance and transnational threats
In the realm of global finance, the United States has adapted to the new 
AND
the rising powers at the IMF, at the expense of European seats. 
Extending cooperation to other issues is easy to wish for, harder to do. 
AND
major power approaches to Iran and North Korea, with some important success. 
A similar combination of formal and informal approaches could help to solidify cooperation on terrorism 
AND
be extended to burden-sharing on trade security in more sensitive locations. 
It is debatable whether such cooperation could be extended to active crises, for example 
AND
build trust in significant, second order problems such as Somalia or Yemen. 
A further area where cooperation can grow is development. Sustaining global economic recovery will 
AND
of western development strategies, an open mind and genuine dialogue seem warranted. 
Cooperative efforts serve two purposes. They are important for functional reasons; the issues 
AND
carries more punch. Counterterrorism cooperation should have greater visibility in both countries. 
Shared interests in tackling transnational threats will only be a part of an overall sense of security. Other security issues-regional security and energy security-will drive divergence. But deeper collaboration on shared threats can contextualize the inevitable confrontations ahead. 
Regulating economic and energy competition
In other areas, the nature of U.S., European and emerging power 
AND
but states profit or lose differently from different regulations; hence fierce competition. 
Similar competitive dynamics over the rules have blocked deeper trade cooperation in recent years. 
AND
as indeed is acknowledged in the QDDR~’s proposals for &amp;#34;elevating economic diplomacy.&amp;#34; 
Issues of relative loss and relative gain may be particularly hard to manage on questions 
AND
climate and the short-term conflict risks of unregulated competition over energy. 
This does not mean abandoning any sense that some of these areas can serve as 
AND
policy, do seem set to cause rough competition, veering into conflict. 
Investing in tools for crisis de-escalation and management
Because competition is inevitable, and because regional security dilemmas will almost certainly prove more complicated over time, a third and critical component of strategy will be to invest up front in tools for crisis de-escalation and management. 
Much of this will be region specific. But across the board, a key 
AND
of power, its presence will help defuse clashes with the emerging powers. 
We can also be creative about the role of middle powers. Against a backdrop 
AND
more concrete crisis prevention and management tools? These issues warrant quiet exploration. 
The United States can and should also invest in reinforcing the UN Security Council (
AND
deployments. These halted crises before they could escalate into direct superpower confrontations. 
Growing use of the UNSC has been a point of surprising commonality between the Bush
AND
region where the shift in the balance of power will be most volatile. 
Still, even if there were a positive vote in the General Assembly (GA
AND
for allowing swift alignment between G-20 leaders during the financial crisis.) 
Crisis management capacity could be developed in several ways: creating an informal mechanism that 
AND
G-20, nor locks the United States into untested membership change. 
And there are interesting models of both informal and semi-formal major power cooperation 
AND
is the example of counter-piracy cooperation in the Horn of Africa. 
Frank debate, not firm divides, on human rights
Finally, it is important to touch on what may be the most contentious of issues between the United States and the emerging powers, namely human rights. 
On basic human rights issues, the key dynamic will be between the West and 
AND
with human rights was a mild opening, but certainly one worth pursuing.
More broadly, using human rights standards or issues of democracy promotion as a yardstick 
AND
and Germany banded together to block U.S. action in Iraq.
So, contentious, yes; neatly dividing the west from the rest, no. There is complexity not cleavage here. And an effort to use human rights or democratic criteria to drive hard cleavages in the international system would likely provoke more serious banding together by the emerging powers-against, not in favor of, our strategy.
CONCLUSION
America has rebounded from dips in its influence before. An oil price rise before economic downturn, a brewing crisis in Iran, a rising competitor, domestic divides and a Democratic president facing a resurgent right-welcome to 1978. Still, absent dramatic change, an economic shift to &amp;#34;the rest&amp;#34; will continue, and political influence will follow.
If we foster cooperation where interests allow, and devote serious resources to global economic and energy diplomacy, we can balance the contentious dynamics of regional security and human rights. Preparing for crises by investing in management tools can help de-escalate them when they arrive. 
This may fail, as the domestic resonance of competition drives out awareness of shared 
AND
G-Zero scenario, with risks of direct conflict between the powers. 



====A grand strategy of primacy requires the unipole to freeze the global distribution of power—-causes, counter-balancing, and war  ====
Nuno P. **Monteiro 12**, Assistant Professor of Political Science at Yale University, &amp;#34;Unrest Assured: Why Unipolarity is Not Peaceful,&amp;#34; International Security, Winter 2012, Vol. 36, No. 3, p. 9-40
A unipole carrying out a defensive-dominance strategy will seek to preserve all three 
AND
out these two pathways to conflict and then illustrate them with historical examples.
To be sure, states can never be certain of other states~’ intentions.61 
AND
, the systemic imbalance of power magnifies uncertainty about the unipole~’s intentions.63
Faced with this uncertainty, other states have two options. First, they can 
AND
as Wohlforth points out, the power differential rests in its favor.66 
Accommodation, however, entails greater risks for minor powers because their survival is not assured if the unipole should turn against them. Thus some of them are likely to implement a second strategic option—resisting the unipole.
The structure of the international system does not entirely determine whether or not a minor 
AND
states, the costs of balancing were lower relative to those of bandwagoning.
In an international system with more than one great power, recalcitrant minor powers would
AND
themselves, which puts them in a position of extreme self-help.
There are four characteristics common to states in this position: (1) anarchy
AND
Recalcitrant minor powers will therefore attempt to bolster their capabilities through internal balancing.
To deter an eventual attack by the unipole and bolster their chances of survival in the event deterrence fails, recalcitrant minor powers will attempt to reinforce their conventional defenses, develop the most effective asymmetric strategies possible, and, most likely in the nuclear age, try to acquire the ultimate deterrent—survivable nuclear weapons.73 In so doing, they seek to become major powers.
Defensive dominance, however, also gives the unipole reason to oppose any such revisions 
AND
that could become the harbinger of an unwanted large-scale balancing attempt.
The unipole is therefore likely to demand that recalcitrant minor powers not revise the status quo. The latter, however, will want to resist such demands because of the threat they pose to those states~’ security.74 Whereas fighting over such demands would probably lead to defeat, conceding to them peacefully would bring the undesired outcome with certainty. A preventive war is therefore likely to ensue.


====Framing issue—-our evidence contains the only rigorous data-based analysis of the conflict-producing effects of unipolarity—-it~’s highly war-prone and their ev relies on faulty data ====
Nuno P. **Monteiro 12**, Assistant Professor of Political Science at Yale University, &amp;#34;Unrest Assured: Why Unipolarity is Not Peaceful,&amp;#34; International Security, Winter 2012, Vol. 36, No. 3, p. 9-40
In 1999, however, William Wohlforth challenged the consensus that unipolarity would soon end. Indeed, in &amp;#34;The Stability of a Unipolar World,&amp;#34; he underscored its durability.11 U.S. preponderance is so marked, he wrote, that &amp;#34;~~f~~or many decades, no state is likely to be in a position to take on the United States in any of the underlying elements of power.&amp;#34;12
Wohlforth further argued that a durable unipolar world is also a peaceful world. In 
AND
&amp;#34;end of history&amp;#34; and the universalization of Western liberal democracy.15
The question of unipolar durability remains the subject of spirited debate. Many analysts, 
AND
argues that &amp;#34;the unipolar world is indeed coming to an end.&amp;#34;21
In contrast, the question of unipolar peacefulness has received virtually no attention. Although 
AND
e., the debate on durability) has all but monopolized our attention.
In this article, I provide a theory of unipolarity that focuses on the issue 
AND
strategy, over time it is possible that it will shift to disengagement.
I support my theory with several empirical examples. These do not aim at systematically testing my argument, for two reasons. First, the unipolar era is too short a period to test structural mechanisms. Second, the United States has consistently implemented a strategy of dominance, limiting opportunities to test my claims on the consequences of disengagement.26

Parent, Assistant Professor of Political Science at the University of Miami, November/December 2011, &amp;#34;The Wisdom of Retrenchment: America Must Cut Back to Move Forward,&amp;#34; Foreign Affairs, Vol. 90, No. 6
Curbing the United States~’ commitments would reduce risks, but it cannot eliminate them.

====Exon-Florio reviews are explicitly REGULATIONS not RESTRICTIONS intended to merely MONITOR and SUPERVISE high profile transactions involving the ownership of companies – production related energy activities are excluded====
CJ **Voss** (Attorney at Stoel Rives LLP) September 24, 20**12** &amp;#34;Energy Law Alert: CFIUS Intervenes in Chinese-Owned Wind Project&amp;#34; http://www.stoel.com/showalert.aspx?Show=9813
President Ford created CFIUS by Executive Order 11858 in 1975, in response to an 
AND
amended by the Foreign Investment and National Security Act of 2007 (&amp;#34;FINSA&amp;#34;).
Scope of Review Under Exon-Florio
Exon-Florio applies to &amp;#34;covered transactions&amp;#34;, which include mergers, acquisitions, and takeovers involving &amp;#34;foreign persons&amp;#34; that could result in foreign control of U.S. businesses, transfers of ownership of a U.S. business from one foreign owner to another, and transactions that result in foreign ownership of a part of an entity or of assets constituting a U.S. business (such as a division).
The regulations implementing FINSA identify certain types of transactions, including leases, start-
AND
buying supplies and inputs, hiring personnel, and purchasing the necessary technology.


&amp;#34; Further, a start-up investment &amp;#34;may involve the acquisition of shares in a newly incorporated subsidiary.&amp;#34; Accordingly, in most cases, these exceptions are unlikely to benefit foreign investors in U.S. renewable energy projects.
Under Exon-Florio, the President is authorized to suspend or prohibit any covered transaction if there is credible evidence that the foreign person exercising control might take action that threatens to impair U.S. national security.
The term &amp;#34;national security&amp;#34; is not defined in the statute or implementing regulations and is construed broadly by CFIUS to include all facts and circumstances that have potential national security implications. Factors that will heighten CFIUS~’s interest in a transaction include whether the acquisition target: 
has contracts with the U.S. government, particularly sole- or single-source defense contracts, classified contracts or contracts with U.S. government agencies that have national security responsibilities (e.g., homeland security, intelligence); 
possesses sensitive or classified technologies, particularly with defense or law enforcement applications, or produces goods, services, or technologies subject to export controls; 
controls &amp;#34;critical infrastructure,&amp;#34; including major energy assets; or 
is engaged in operations that involve nuclear energy. 
In addition, the prospective purchaser~’s nationality and whether it is controlled or owned (in whole or in part) by a foreign government are important factors in determining whether a CFIUS review may be appropriate.
In light of these factors, national security concerns may arise in a number of ways when a foreign entity acquires a U.S. renewable energy business: 
If the U.S. business holds sensitive, classified, or export controlled information or technology, or provides power or energy-related products directly to a U.S. government agency, CFIUS approval should be sought. 
Transactions involving foreign control over &amp;#34;major energy assets&amp;#34; are subject to heightened scrutiny
AND
could materially disrupt an energy supply chain likely would raise national security concerns.
The nationality of the acquirer likely influences the CFIUS process. Transactions involving acquirers based in China, Russia, certain countries in the Middle East, and other countries perceived as &amp;#34;non-cooperative&amp;#34; with respect to national security-related matters likely will be subject to greater scrutiny than transactions involving acquirers based in the E.U. or other G20 nations.

1)  Participation in decentralized politics is disempowering and exacerbates power differentials within communities~-~--turns the whole case and means decisions are worse than they’d be with no deliberation at all
