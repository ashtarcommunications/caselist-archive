Public investments of these magnitudes, targeted at specific industries, arguably constitute an industrial policy, albeit a sectoral one, unlike the earlier proposals of the 1980~’s —that is, a government strategy to steer resources toward select producers or technologies.

however, there are signs of a revival of interest in nuclear generation. 
Renewable sources are already being favoured by governments. The British government, for example

The problem with direct promotional action by government is that it does not address the

reasons of principle involving inherent information failures and the influence of pressure groups. 
Most analyses of climate change policy are silent on these issues of principle. The Stern Review, for example, ignores completely the economic analysis of government action, exem- plified in the ~’public choice~’ theory that has been brought to such prominence by James Buchanan, Gordon Tullock and others,6 and the Hayekian view of competitive markets. 
The Hayekian critique of government action, as explained earlier, emphasises the role of

This analysis thus calls for a broader approach to environmental security based on retrieving the manner in which political actors construct discourses of ~’scarcity~’ in response to ecological, energy and economic crises (critical security studies) in the context of the historically-specific socio-political and geopolitical relations of domination by which their power is constituted, and which are often implicated in the acceleration of these very crises (historical sociology and historical materialism).

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission~’s license approval for two new reactors at Southern Company~’s Georgia Vogtle plant does not signal the beginning of nuclear renaissance in the U.S. In fact, it does not even guarantee that the reactors will come online.

====Energy production refers to the extraction, conversion, and distribution of energy – excludes R%26D====
**Koplow 4** Doug Koplow is the founder of Earth Track in Cambridge, MA. He has worked on natural resource subsidy issues for 20 years, primarily in the energy sector &amp;#34;Subsidies to Energy Industries&amp;#34; Encyclopedia of Energy Vol 5 2004www.earthtrack.net/files/Energy%20Encyclopedia,%20wv.pdf
3. SUBSIDIES THROUGH THE FUEL CYCLE
Because no two fuel cycles are exactly the same, examining subsidies through the context of a generic fuel cycle is instructive in providing an overall framework from which to understand how common subsidization policies work. Subsidies are grouped into preproduction (e.g., R%26D, resource location), production (e.g., extraction, conversion/generation, distribution, accident risks), consumption, postproduction (e.g., decommissioning, reclamation), and externalities (e.g., energy security, environmental, health and safety).
3.1 Preproduction
Preproduction activities include research into new technologies, improving existing technologies, and market assessments to identify the location and quality of energy resources.
3.1.1 Research and Development
R%26D subsidies to energy are common worldwide, generally through government-funded 
AND
%26D of 50% versus private returns of only 20 to 30%.
However, the general concept masks several potential concerns regarding energy R%26D. First, ideas near commercialization have much lower spillover than does basic research, making subsidies harder to justify. Second, politics is often an important factor in R%26D choices, especially regarding how the research plans are structured and the support for follow-on funding for existing projects.
Allocation bias is also a concern. Historical data on energy R%26D (
AND
one-twentieth, albeit during the more limited 1995-1998 period.
3.1.2 Resource Location
Governments frequently conduct surveys to identify the location and composition of energy resources. Although 
AND
, the costs of siting studies should be recovered from the beneficiary industries.
3.2 Production
Energy production includes all stages from the point of resource location through distribution to the final consumers. Specific items examined here include resource extraction, resource conversion (including electricity), the various distribution links to bring the energy resource to the point of final use, and accident risks.

3. From securitisation to militarisation 3.1 Complicity
This analysis thus calls for a broader approach to environmental security based on retrieving the manner in which political actors construct discourses of ~’scarcity~’ in response to ecological, energy and economic crises (critical security studies) in the context of the historically-specific socio-political and geopolitical relations of domination by which their power is constituted, and which are often implicated in the acceleration of these very crises (historical sociology and historical materialism).
Instead, both realist and liberal orthodox IR approaches focus on different aspects of interstate 
AND
the economy in society and the concomitant politically-constituted nature of economics.
Hence, they neglect the profound irrationality of collective state behaviour, which systematically erodes 
AND
realism and liberalism are ideologically implicated in the acceleration of global systemic crises.
By the same token, the incapacity to recognise and critically interrogate how prevailing social
AND
fuels the proliferation of violent conflict and militarisation responsible for magnified global insecurity.
~’Securitisation~’ refers to a ~’speech act~’ - an act of labelling - whereby political authorities 
AND
-legal military-police measures in purported response to an existential danger.
The problem in the context of global ecological, economic and energy crises is that 
AND
responding to global systemic crises other than to reduce them to their symptoms.
Indeed, orthodox IR theory has largely responded to global systemic crises not with new 
AND
capacities to maintain existing power structures, to keep the lid on.93
Global crises are thus viewed as amplifying factors that could mobilise the popular will in 
AND
problematise potentially recalcitrant populations - rationalising violence toward them as a control mechanism.
Consequently, for the most part, the policy implications of orthodox IR approaches involve 
AND
a ~’threat-multiplier which exacerbates existing trends, tensions and instability~’.95
In practice, this generates an excessive preoccupation not with the causes of global crisis 
AND
stressors by generating humanitarian crises, population migrations and other complex emergencies.96
A similar study by the US Joint Forces Command draws attention to the danger of 
AND
resources and skills to shape transnational processes in their own class interest.~’99
Thus, the securitisation of global crisis leads not only to the problematisation of particular 
AND
* by dominating a resource-rich region critical for global capitalism.100
But even this does not go far enough, for arguably the construction of certain 
AND
, religious, political or economic lines — eventually legitimising their annihilation.102
In other words, genocidal violence is inherently rooted in a prior and ongoing ideological 
AND
from which that programme derives can the emergence of genocidal intent become explicable.
Building on this insight, Semelin demonstrates that the process of exclusionary social group construction 
AND
genocide, can become legitimised as contributing to the resolution of crises.105
This does not imply that the securitisation of global crises by Western defence agencies is 
AND
for crisis onto a newly constructed ~’outsider~’ group vindicating various forms of violence.
While recommendations to shift our frame of orientation away from conventional state-centrism toward 
AND
of state security planning in the context of counter-terrorism operations abroad.
The intensifying problematisation and externalisation of Muslim-majority regions and populations by Western security 
AND
the efficacy of the prevailing geopolitical and economic order is ideologically beyond question.
As much as this analysis highlights a direct link between global systemic crises, social polarisation and state militarisation, it fundamentally undermines the idea of a symbiotic link between natural resources and conflict per se. Neither ~’resource shortages~’ nor ~’resource abundance~’ (in ecological, energy, food and monetary terms) necessitate conflict by themselves.
There are two key operative factors that determine whether either condition could lead to conflict
AND
to externalisation of those groups, and the legitimisation of violence towards them.
Ultimately, this systems approach to global crises strongly suggests that conventional policy ~’reform~’ is 
AND
of the post-carbon era through social, political and economic transformation.
Yet conventional theoretical and policy approaches fail to (1) fully engage with the 
AND
, effective, and joined-up policy-making on these issues.

This chapter discusses how a theory building process in peace research has been influenced by epistemological debates between the proponents of behavioralists and their critics in social science. In the first part, the author briefly explains the modes of inquiry for theory building. The majority of the chapter, however, looks at such issues as values, critical pedagogy, and holistic approaches in understanding the nature of peace and conflict.
 The Emergence of Peace Research
Some argue that the history of peace studies has no geographic boundaries. It can 
AND
analyzed the links between an individual actor~’s behavior and patterns of collective action.
The impulse for studying peace and conflict systematically was fomented in the early 20th century
AND
political leaders were regarded as important in the transformation of an international system.
Peace research after World War II was influenced by the emergence of international relations as 
AND
agendas, and it expanded theoretical perspectives and research areas to be investigated.
The evolution of peace and conflict research since the 1970s has been characterized by inter
AND
diverse methodological traditions given its disciplinary goals and the complexities of subject matters.
Modes of Social Inquiry
In a positivist mode of inquiry, social knowledge emerges from emulating the procedures of 
AND
of empirical phenomena, theory ought to explain and predict the trend of events
Contrary to that, hermeneutics is based on the analysis of the meanings which human 
AND
from within the experiences of social groups which are the object of research.
Critical theory methodology identifies forms of conflict and patterns of development which could lead to the transformation of a world order. There is no over-arching ahistorical structure. Explanation of the prospects for change requires analysis of the connections between modes of production and hierarchical political structures (Cox, 1996). The scope of the inquiryalso focuses on a distorted ideological account of social relations by a hegemonic class.
In a postmodern vein, problems in different social locations and histories are interpreted by 
AND
1994:14). Resolving major theoretical differences is not desirable nor feasible.
Scientific Approaches to Peace Research
The early endeavor to establish a peace science originates in mathematical modelling of dynamics of arms races (Richardson, 1960). Quantitative studies of conflict behavior in the 1960s was affected by the revolution of behavioral sciences. Theoretical development was believed to be promoted by the collection of raw data, highly deductive propositions, and empirical verification. Formal models supported by statistical analysis were expected to explain both behavioral and structural characteristics of violent conflict.
The motivation behind scientific research was that ideas for creating a peaceful world would emerge 
AND
and the Cuban Missile Crisis.(Allison, 1971; Paige, 1968)
Scientific orientation has paid a great deal of attention to data collection and representation of 
AND
systematic observation of the problems of violence and other types of human sufferings.
The Critique of Behavioral Sciences
The behavioralist traditions of peace research have been criticized for being too empiricist.(Galtung
AND
discuss key research questions stems from conceptual development of issues to be studied.
Ignoring normative questions would not help find alternative visions. Conditions for building peace are 
AND
the reductionist character of contemporary thought to the drive for control of nature.
The critique of behavioral sciences coincides with a &amp;#34;critique of conscience&amp;#34; in the 
AND
the way they are compatible with the general goal of a disciplinary focus.
Holistic Approaches
Some researchers suggest that peace studies should start from holism as the framework.(Smoker 
AND
peace. The achievement of peace should be a holistic goal of research.
Holistic versions of theories project the flow of alternative images of reality. There are 
AND
world. More holistic approaches can be encouraged by hermeneutic philosophy of science.
Reasoning needs to be combined with experiences in understanding the holistic pictures of social relations
AND
relationships result from the process of formation and transformation of images and symbols.
Peace studies may belong to the same category as history and critical sociology in terms of its methods to study an object. In contrast with economics, many factors related to structural violence such as political repression and economic exploitation cannot be easily understood without socio-historical contexts. Distinctions between independent and dependent variables are artificial. Understanding the outcome of an event would be enhanced by clarifying the specific goals of actors.
Emancipatory Projects
Direct criticism of sovereign state power may be based on questioning the mode of analysis 
AND
Thus emancipatory projects oppose intellectual and social closure which does not tolerate diversity.
In a poststructural approach, language and discourse shape politics and social institutions.(Bannet
AND
historically contingent origin and political role of binary hierarchies are uncovered by deconstructionism.
Instead of being instruments of bureaucratic social control, human studies should serve emancipatory aims. Society is imagined less as a material structure, organic order, or social system than as a construction rooted in historically specific discursive practices. Communities serve as texts whose symbols and meanings need to be translated. Interpretative knowledge promotes diversity, expands tolerance, and legitimates difference as well as fosters understanding and communication (Seidman, 1994:14-5)
People~’s perceptions about the world rely on their social and cultural milieu. The goal 
AND
role in promoting human solidarity.(Waever, Ole, 1996:171)
Value Issues
Even in a conventional mode of inquiry, values are not always considered separate from 
AND
the exclusionary state can be justified in terms of a goal oriented research.
Each discipline is governed by certain sets of assumptions and rules that determine its approaches 
AND
peace research may be found in the ideals of social transformation through knowledge.
Efforts have been made to find a universal standard in Western societies which have a 
AND
conceptualize peace in terms of cultural expectations which various groups of people possess.
If normative pluralism is accepted, peace research must find the interactions between value expectations
AND
prevailing in the world but also on the linkage which exists among them.
Participatory Research and Empowerment
Participatory projects are important in an organized effort of endogenous peace learning. It affects the sense of control over the world by the marginalized. Peace research can serve the survival needs specific to the grassroots level. Action research is part of a feedback process in learning those who are the object of study. The situations in local communities should be considered in terms of basic human need values.
The needs of people can be identified by integrating research and practice. Researchers should not arbitrarily define peace in their judgement but build an interactive relationship with those who are exposed to violence and are living under the condition of peacelessness. The mode of inquires for empowerment maximizes the possibilities for reflection, creativity, and full participation of all engaged in the study. Action results from interpretations and assessments of choices.
If the overall intent of peace research is to develop the well-informed public, research should be incorporated into a personal, inward, and interactive process. Research and learning are a holistic process of integrating social experiences and knowledge. The task of peace research should be the analysis of the social process through which peace can be achieved.
Critical Pedagogy and Cultural Theory
Critical pedagogy deals with such issues as how knowledge can be used to change society
AND
vital instrument for generating the insights and energy needed to transform those relationships.
Cultural energy is a key element for mobilizing the social action that drives successful grassroots 
AND
of a group~’s solidarity, organizational efficiency, participation, and volunteer spirit.
This cultural theory has been applied to the explanation of a positive linkage between culture 
AND
They attempt to achieve political and economic autonomy through culture based development.
The culturally motivated development projects helped Indians in the Ecuador highland make impressive strides since 
AND
a collective recognition of how the problem was rooted within the local reality.
Many of these communities have joined together to form federations that sponsored their own cultural 
AND
development. Cultural projects often began with local voices responding to local needs.
Goals of Peace Research
Peace research can be both a process of discovering knowledge about peace and a process 
AND
political, economic, and cultural transformations, however, would be different.
Research for peace enhances a liberating experience that motivates an individual to seek changes for 
AND
in real events such as peace movements could be important methods of observation.
The goals of research are as equally important as or more important than the processes 
AND
value judgement on how people achieve their physical and spiritual well-being.
Conclusion
Efforts to study peace more systematically are ascribed to modern social science traditions. As 
AND
to problems which humanity faces at the present time and in the future.
