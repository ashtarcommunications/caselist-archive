A pragmatic theory of argument
The first step in developing a justifiable theory of rational argument that can account for 
AND
the intrusiveness of its moral and political will&amp;#34; (1992, 64).
The performative contradiction at the heart of postmodernism is nowhere more evident than in the 
AND
is pragmatic efficacy in fulfilling a purpose in relation to a given problem.
Both modernists and postmodernists generally assume that truth and fact are equivalent terms. Thus, a &amp;#34;true&amp;#34; statement is one that is factually correct in all circumstances. By this standard, of course, there are no totally &amp;#34;true&amp;#34; statements. However, if no statement can be proved factually true, then a focus on facts is an inappropriate standard for judging truth.
I suggest that knowledge and truth should be understood not as factual statements that are 
AND
or tomorrow, because it usefully and consistently solves a particular epistemic problem.
The standard for &amp;#34;truth&amp;#34; is pragmatic utility in fulfilling a purpose in relation 
AND
the facts,&amp;#34; it does not deny that a real-world exists.
Thus, a pragmatist endorses a given scientific theory because the symbolic description present in 
AND
work, that is, avoiding nature&amp;#39;s kicks in fulfilling a given purpose.

In defense of rational argument
When argument is viewed as a pragmatic problem-solving tool, the power of the postmodern critique largely dissipates. At the most basic level, a pragmatic theory of argument is based on premises such as the following:
&amp;#39;Statements supported by evidence and reasoning are more likely to be useful for satisfactorily solving a problem than ones that lack that support.
&amp;#39;Consistent arguments are more likely to be generalizable than inconsistent ones.

Argument as an internal process within an individual and external process within society provides a method of testing the claims of potential oppressors.

Against this view, it could be argued that pragmatism, because of its &amp;#34;

Life good~-~--Schopenhaeur wrong

IV. Is life “better than” death a priori?
a. The value of survival
We are now in a position to state an answer to our main question. 
AND
, then consciousness*desire can be simplified to consciousness.
In this way, pain can be seen to address an additional circumstance (the 
AND
”—pleasure would have value only so long as the advantage is needed.
However, such an image would also be the result of what we characterized earlier 
AND
as desiring the end of desire—the disappearance of value.31
In sum: no problem for consciousness precedes or is inherent to consciousness, which 
AND
an a posteriori (i.e., circumstantial) phenomenon of consciousness.
Furthermore, since, as we have seen, life is an expression of desire 
AND
a value to all life in general) is the same for all.
It follows that life at its essence is pleasure. Life inherently, initially, 
AND
), and then augment (intensify) or expand (diversify) pleasure.
In conclusion, since the infinite desire for pleasure finds its greatest satisfaction a priori 
AND
inquiry—on the subjective or circumstantial or a posteriori value of life.
b. The value of birth
The above “demonstration” that our survival-as-such is good may 
AND
rationally prefer a priori not to have been born in the first place.
We can also reason that it is the circumstance that the perpetuation of life and 
AND
, this imperfection of pleasure, which forms the central concern of theological worldviews 
 (which devalue pleasure in its finite form—at least, to the extent that it does not seem conditioned by them). This concern finds expression in two assertions: that experience belongs to an immortal soul; and that perfect pleasure is guaranteed in “heaven.”
“Heaven” is defined as a place where nothing bad can occur—a 
AND
the same as desiring the end of desire, the disappearance of value.
We need not investigate in detail the circumstances that make it possible to say that 
AND
of goodness in order to be able to find anything good at all.
Heaven can be defined as “God’s realm.” That “God” may be defined as an inescapable (perhaps even all-inclusive, somehow), eternally consistent, committed and supreme preference and power. Through these attributes, It makes heaven possible. Therefore, it is Its authority that conditions the possibility of the good itself (which for greedy nihilists, as we have shown, is conditioned on the idea of its necessity). Thus, that “God” becomes the source or foundation of ethics and value.
Accordingly, when the idea that such a “God” does not exist becomes 
AND
words, she would become a passive nihilist—in the Nietzschean sense.
In sum, there would be two sides to this paradoxical coin we can now 
AND
“escape” the world—and costly to try to do so.
The Nietzschean God could perhaps be distinguished from the run of the mill “God
AND
is not necessary that the Pascalian God exist for things to be good.
It is perhaps the temptation to further define the Pascalian God, in order to make It more predictable, that eventually leads us to conceive of the totalitarian Nietzschean God—inflating, in the process, the problem of fortune (chance), from a discrete, marginal, “quantized” phenomenon, so to speak, to a massive one.
b. Post-theism and axiological realism
Post-theism needs not involve any negation of the existence of a particular “God.”36 It needs only involve a realization that we must find answers without reference to any such “God.”
The “cause” for the existence of value, like the ”cause” 
AND
we just happen to live in that world with the relevant modal particularity).
What must be understood is that neither “theory” should change anything to the “value of value.”
An ethical foundation is “something for the sake of which everything else can be valued.”37 Greedy nihilists believe that an absence of external obligation (external force) at the foundation (or as the source) of value (desire) would eliminate value. However, we have seen that their worldview was founded on a desire for something that would make value impossible. Perhaps, then, something like “gratuity” (freedom) would best serve as “foundation.”
But such a “foundation” would seem to correspond to no foundation at all
AND
existence? (Or, perhaps more importantly, what might it subtract?)
In other words, while we see that the constitution of all morality is twofold—including (1) value (i.e., the fact that we value anything), and (2) the fact that the service of what we value may be conditioned38—we now also see that, however, we cannot meaningfully, by ourselves, place conditions for our valuing things in general, for valuing things in the first place.
In yet other words, we have seen that, in terms of general phenomena, care (value) “precedes” belief. Therefore, how could any belief—except the senseless (uninformative) belief that value exists—rationally condition value? More specifically, how could belief in a particular explanation for the existence of value condition value? (These are rhetorical questions.)
Value cannot be self-defeating—desire cannot desire its own dissatisfaction. Moreover
AND
more than the product of a special kind of confusion (or stupidity).
In this sense, we are “trapped” in value—our “escape” could only come (directly at least, if at all) from the exterior. Perhaps then it follows that it is in those who depend on external references, or transcendental “truths,” to provide their axiological source or foundation that we truly begin to find the collapse of what makes value (and therefore morality) possible.
c. Temptation of “meaning”
To ask for the meaning of life can be thought ultimately to ask what should 
AND
and how what we value can be served, on the other hand.
On the one hand, one who seeks an explanation for the fact that life 
AND
life has value a priori, irrespective of any explanation regarding its existence.
As we have
AND
 our finding life good.

Extinction actually is the end of all human consciousness~-~--this arg is dumb
Stenger 92 – Victor J. Stenger, Adjunct Professor of Philosophy, University of Colorado, 1992, “The Myth of Quantum Consciousness,” online: http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/vstenger/Quantum/QuantumConsciousness.pdf
Quantum mechanics is called on further to argue that the cosmic field, like Newton’s

spirit and its anything-goes rhetorical tactics. Orientalism, he observes,
taught an entire generation of Arabs the art of self-pity — “were 
AND
But in any case, he does not believe in the “truth.”
One can understand why today, in the context of the war against jihadist terrorism, Ibn Warraq has regrets, for example, about calling Said’s tactics “intellectual terrorism.” But his description of those tactics and their impact on Middle East scholarship is spot on.
Ibn Warraq studied philosophy and Arabic, taught school, opened an Indian restaurant, and worked for a travel agency before turning his formidable talents to writing about Islam.
Ibn Warraq’s criticisms of Said come fast and furious. He shows that Said routinely 
AND
for, showing what the true Orient and Islam really are.’”
Furthermore, Said commits “historical howlers” and engages in acts of “intellectual dishonesty.” For example, he asserts that “at the end of the seventeenth century, Britain and France dominated the eastern Mediterranean, when in fact the Levant was still controlled for the next hundred years by the Ottomans.” That’s no small blunder for a book about European imperialism in the Middle East.
Meanwhile, Said’s repeated mischaracterizations of the writings of Orientalists such as R.W
AND
‘ntesi — great grief seized me at heart when I heard this.”
Said puts all this sloppiness and sophistry and specious argumentation in the service of the 
AND
Ibn Warraq shows that elementary historical considerations swiftly dispose of Said’s signature thesis:
Where the French presence lasted fewer than four years before they were ignominiously expelled by 
AND
Muslim hands. But no Spanish or Greek politics of victimhood apparently exists.
Yet these facts are not likely to dissuade Said’s disciples, whose grievances against the West do not ultimately depend upon historical claims but rather are rooted in an underlying belief in the West’s distinctive intellectual blindness and moral depravity.
That’s why, in a display of staggering erudition, Ibn Warraq devotes the bulk of his somewhat quirky and quite compelling book to a defense of Western ideas, particularly as they have been expressed in Orientalist scholarship — philological, historical, archeological, literary, and philosophical — and in Western depictions of the Orient in painting, sculpture, music, and literature.
In Part II, he identifies rationalism, universalism, and self-criticism as

**Mills 6**—Submitted in partial satisfaction of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science In the Energy and Resources Group of the University of California, Berkeley (Andrew, Wind Energy in Indian Country: Turning to Wind for the Seventh Generation, rael.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/very-old-site/Mills-2006-Wind_Energy_in_Indian_Country.pdf)

Focusing too much effort on energy development projects can lead to distortions in the economy 
AND
from wind farms through provisions that increase the costs with other comparative advantages. 


====Doesn~’t undermine the trust doctrine and choice is key ====
**Unger 10**—Clerk, Hon. Ferdinand Fernandez , U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, JD Loyola Law School, MA - Linguistic Anthropology, University of Texas at Austin (Kathleen, CHANGE IS IN THE WIND: SELF-DETERMINATION AND WIND POWER THROUGH TRIBAL ENERGY RESOURCE AGREEMENTS, http://www.tribesandclimatechange.org/docs/tribes_24.pdf)

Another area of concern regarding TERAs is their effect on the federal trust obligation toward 
AND
characterizing it as an expression of the DOI~’s &amp;#34;residual trust responsibility.&amp;#34; 196


====Tribes won~’t get screwed by companies ====
**Royster 12**—Professor of Law and Co-Director, Native American Law Center, University of Tulsa College of Law (Judith, Tribal Energy Development: Renewables and the Problem of the Current Statutory Structures, 31 Stan. Envtl. L.J. 91)

The proposed amendment to the definition of &amp;#34;mineral resources&amp;#34; in the IMDA would 
AND
it in the regulations strengthens the tribe~’s role in the decision making process.




Wind/Solar PIC


====Both wind and solar are critical—-the CP uses gas and coal for backup power which means it doesn~’t solve the aff ====
**Scott 11**—Environment and business writing for corporate clients, newspapers, magazines and think tanks. Writes for Bloomberg New Energy Finance (Mike, A marriage made in heaven – why hybrid projects could be the future, http://carboncopycommunications.com/business-trade-press/a-marriage-made-in-heaven-%E2%80%93-why-hybrid-projects-could-be-the-future/)

Combining two renewable power technologies may not be conventional, but it can make technical 
AND
winds during monsoon season and more sun during the rest of the year.


====no link to radar ====
DOE, 7 (US Department of Energy, &amp;#34;Frequently Asked Questions about Wind and Rader,&amp;#34; Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, 10/10, http://www1.eere.energy.gov/windandhydro/federalwindsiting/radar_faqs.html~~%234)
Will wind energy hurt our ability to defend the country against attack? No. 
AND
over 20 years of experience in properly siting wind projects to avoid negative impacts

, whether on the environment or military operations. Problems exist when developers are not 
AND
that exist, and those that are worth of developing in the future.


====The impact is extinction ====
Manuel Valenzuela 5, The Making of the Enemy, 19 December 2005, http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/Why_They_Hate_Us/Making_Enemies.html
Hidden behind dark corners, lurking underneath beds, fantasy bogeymen not known or understood 
AND
of their puppeteers the march towards war, invasion and occupation can commence.


====Double bind—-either Natives want wind so they~’ll do it anyway, or they~’ll just choose solar b/c it~’s cheaper ====
**Appleyard 10/1**—Chief Editor, Renewable Energy World (10/1/12, David, Global Renewables Investment Sets New Record, http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2012/10/global-renewables-investment-sets-new-record?page=all)

Note —- the report is the Global Trends in Renewable Energy Investment Report (GTR) for 2012——comprehensive analysis from the Frankfurt School of Finance %26 Management

Noting that one of the dominant features of 2011 was technology costs, the report 
AND
large-scale solar thermal electricity generation projects in Spain and the US.

====The DA is an anxiety ridden excuse to ignore internal colonization—-their arguments are paranoid ramblings ====
**Hoggett 4**—prof of politics and co-dir. of Center for Psycho-Social Studies, U West England. Degree in social psychology, U Sussex—AND—Dr. Simon Clarke—prof of psycho-social studies and co-dir. of the center. (The Empire of Fear: The American Political Psyche and the Culture of Paranoia, http://www.btinternet.com/~~psycho_social/Vol5/JPSS5-PHSC1.htm)

It is necessary therefore to focus upon this dark side of the new Promethean for 
AND
us feel better. The problem is that we don~’t face the problem. 


====No impact—-most qualified expert====
**Korb 9/9** Lawrence Korb is a former assistant secretary of defense in the Reagan administration and is a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress. &amp;#34;Cuts Would Not Affect Security,&amp;#34; 2012, NYT, http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2012/09/09/how-big-should-the-defense-budget-be/cuts-would-not-affect-security
But the United States can afford defense cuts, without undermining national security, for 
AND
spending, and our allies would account for about half of the rest.


====Cliff won~’t pass because both parties want a new deal in 2013 ====
**Barno 11/7**—retired Lieutenant General of the United States Army. Master~’s in National Security and Strategic Studies from Georgetown University—Dr. Nora Bensahel is Deputy Director of Studies and a Senior Fellow at the Center for a New American Security—AND Joel Smith and Jacob Stokes; Research Assistants at the Center for a New American Security (David, Brace Yourself, [[www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/11/07/brace_yourself?page=full-http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/11/07/brace_yourself?page=full]])

The national security establishment has focused primarily on the potential cuts to the Pentagon, 
AND
reaching a broader consensus in 2013 about balancing the nation~’s revenues and expenditures.




====Republicans will acquiesce before the impact kicks in ====
**Krugman 11/8**—Nobel Prize Winner. Does that Yale thing (Paul, Let~’s Not Make a Deal, [[www.nytimes.com/2012/11/09/opinion/krugman-lets-not-make-a-deal.html?hp-http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/09/opinion/krugman-lets-not-make-a-deal.html?hp]])

Why? Because Republicans are trying, for the third time since he took office
AND
give in to threats. No deal is better than a bad deal.


====Even massive economic decline has zero chance of war ====
Robert **Jervis 11**, Professor in the Department of Political Science and School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University, December 2011, &amp;#34;Force in Our Times,&amp;#34; Survival, Vol. 25, No. 4, p. 403-425
Even if war is still seen as evil, the security community could be dissolved 
AND
times bring about greater economic conflict, it will not make war thinkable.


====Plan bipart + tribes like it ====
**Brown 10** — AP (Matthew, Indian tribes to Congress – Streamline energy development, www.buffalopost.net/?p=8525~~%23more-8525)

American Indian leaders on Thursday asked Congress to streamline the development of energy projects on 
AND
on public lands – including reservations, which are held in federal trust.


====They will just delay the cuts ====

If Congress and the president fail to strike a comprehensive deal, they will face 
AND
, there is little incentive for them to postpone the day of reckoning.


====FISA extension thumps the DA —- controversial and consumes floor time====
Tim Starks 11-2, CQ Roll Call Staff, &amp;#34;Ron Wyden Blocks Surveillance Bill That Is Barack Obama Priority,&amp;#34; 11-2-12, http://www.rollcall.com/news/Ron-Wyden-Blocks-Surveillance-Bill-That-Is-Barack-Obama-Priority-218649-1.html?pos=hln
For the lame-duck session, add another bill to the Senate agenda that 
AND
. The two chambers will have to reconcile the three dueling expiration dates.


====Reducing regulations on Native energy is popular ====
**Jones 11**—Senior Fellow on the Energy Policy Team, Center for American Progres—AND—Bracken Hendricks, Senior Fellow, and Jorge Madrid, Research Associate (Van, Clearing the Way for a Native Opportunity in America~’s &amp;#34;Sputnik Moment&amp;#34;, http://www.nativetimes.com/index.php?option=com_content%26view=article%26id=4853:clearing-the-way-for-a-native-opportunity-in-americas-sputnikmoment%26catid=46%26Itemid=22)
