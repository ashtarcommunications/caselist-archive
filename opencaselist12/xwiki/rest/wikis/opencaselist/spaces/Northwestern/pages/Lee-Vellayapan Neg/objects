The affirmative’s failure to advance a topical defense of federal policy undermines debate’s transformative and intellectual potential
First, a limited topic of discussion that provides for equitable ground is key to productive inculcation of decision-making and advocacy skills in every and all facets of life~-~--even if their position is contestable that’s distinct from it being valuably debatable~-~--this still provides room for flexibility, creativity, and innovation, but targets the discussion to avoid mere statements of fact~-~--T debates also solve any possible turn

Debate is a means of settling differences, so there must be a difference of 
AND
particular point of difference, which will be outlined in the following discussion.

Second, discussion of specific policy-questions is crucial for skills development~-~--we control uniqueness: university students already have preconceived and ideological notions about how the world operates~-~--government policy discussion is vital to force engagement with and resolution of competing perspectives to improve social outcomes, however those outcomes may be defined~-~--and, it breaks out of traditional pedagogical frameworks by positing students as agents of decision-making

We suggest that alternative models of identity and community are required from those put forward by essentialist theories, andthat these are offered by the work of two theorists, SatyaMohanty and Lynn Hankinson Nelson.

The premise of their response to framework is that issues of identity/race/culture should be protected from exposure to reason-giving debate~-~--this impedes the culture of democratic debate that’s key to effective decisionmaking in a pluralistic society~-~--it’s also simply wrong to claim that framework oppresses identity or alternate styles~-~--our argument is style-neutral~-~--it simply asks that narrative/experience/etc be used to support a policy conclusion which solves their offense as well as ours
