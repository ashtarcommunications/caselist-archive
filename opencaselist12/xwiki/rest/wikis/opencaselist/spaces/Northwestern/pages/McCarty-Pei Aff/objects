UNDER THE YOKE: EUROPE~’S NATURAL GAS DEPENDENCY ON RUSSIA&#xD;
Rising shale gas supplies have significantly reduced U.S. requirements for LNG, a move that has already had geopolitical implications.

There is a real danger that investor uncertainty will inhibit investment in future gas supplies. If the shale gas revolution can be continued and replicated this does not matter. Shale gas can provide abundant supplies of cheap natural gas. However, if it disappoints then, as the 2010 report notes, in five to ten years gas markets could face significant shortages as a result of the very long lead times on upstream gas projects.&#xD;

Rising shale gas supplies have significantly reduced U.S. requirements for LNG, a move that has already had geopolitical implications.

There is a real danger that investor uncertainty will inhibit investment in future gas supplies. If the shale gas revolution can be continued and replicated this does not matter. Shale gas can provide abundant supplies of cheap natural gas. However, if it disappoints then, as the 2010 report notes, in five to ten years gas markets could face significant shortages as a result of the very long lead times on upstream gas projects.&#xD;

Jeffrey **Goldberg 1-23**, Bloomberg View columnist and a national correspondent for the Atlantic, January 23, 2012, &amp;#34;How Iran Could Trigger Accidental Armageddon,&amp;#34; online: http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-24/how-iran-may-trigger-accidental-armageddon-commentary-by-jeffrey-goldberg.html&#xD;
One of the arguments often made in favor of bombing Iran to cripple its nuclear program is this: The mullahs in Tehran are madmen who believe it is their consecrated duty to destroy the perfidious Zionist entity (which is to say, Israel) and so are building nuclear weapons to launch at Tel Aviv at the first favorable moment.&#xD;
It~’s beyond a doubt that the Iranian regime would like to bring about the destruction of Israel. However, the mullahs are also cynics and men determined, more than anything, to maintain their hold on absolute power.&#xD;
Which is why it~’s unlikely that they would immediately use their new weapons against Israel. An outright attack on Israel - - a country possessing as many as 200 nuclear weapons and sophisticated delivery systems — would lead to the obliteration of Tehran, the deaths of millions, and the destruction of Iran~’s military and industrial capabilities.&#xD;
The mullahs know this. But here~’s the problem: It may not matter. The threat of a deliberate nuclear attack pales in comparison with the chance that a nuclear-armed Iran could accidentally trigger a cataclysmic exchange with Israel.&#xD;
Warp-Speed Escalation&#xD;
The experts who study this depressing issue seem to agree that a Middle East in which Iran has four or five nuclear weapons would be dangerously unstable and prone to warp-speed escalation.&#xD;
Here~’s one possible scenario for the not-so-distant future: Hezbollah, &#xD;
AND&#xD;
question of what it will do if Israel refuses to heed its demand.&#xD;
Dennis Ross, who until recently served as President Barack Obama~’s Iran point man on &#xD;
AND&#xD;
chain of events that would be like ~’Guns of August~’ on steroids.&amp;#34;&#xD;
Imagine that Israel detects a mobilization of Iran~’s rocket force or the sudden movement of &#xD;
AND&#xD;
compelled to attack Israel first, knowing that it has no second chance?&#xD;
Bruce Blair, the co-founder of the nuclear disarmament group Global Zero and an expert on nuclear strategy, told me that in a sudden crisis Iran and Israel might each abandon traditional peacetime safeguards, making an accidental exchange more likely.&#xD;
&amp;#34;A confrontation that brings the two nuclear-armed states to a boiling point would likely lead them to raise the launch- readiness of their forces — mating warheads to delivery vehicles and preparing to fire on short notice,&amp;#34; he said. &amp;#34;Missiles put on hair-trigger alert also obviously increase the danger of their launch and release on false warning of attack — false indications that the other side has initiated an attack.&amp;#34;&#xD;
Then comes the problem of misinterpreted data, Blair said. &amp;#34;Intelligence failures in the midst of a nuclear crisis could readily lead to a false impression that the other side has decided to attack, and induce the other side to launch a preemptive strike.&amp;#34;&#xD;
~’Cognitive Bias~’&#xD;
Blair notes that in a crisis it isn~’t irrational to expect an attack, and this expectation makes it more likely that a leader will read the worst into incomplete intelligence. &amp;#34;This predisposition is a cognitive bias that increases the danger that one side will jump the gun on the basis of incorrect information,&amp;#34; he said.&#xD;
Ross told me that Iran~’s relative proximity to Israel and the total absence of ties &#xD;
AND&#xD;
nearly had a nuclear war. We were much closer than we realized.&amp;#34;&#xD;
The answer to this predicament is to deny Iran nuclear weapons, but not through an attack on its nuclear facilities, at least not now. &amp;#34;The liabilities of preemptive attack on Iran~’s nuclear program vastly outweigh the benefits,&amp;#34; Blair said. &amp;#34;But certainly Iran~’s program must be stopped before it reaches fruition with a nuclear weapons delivery capability.&amp;#34;&#xD;
Ross argues that the Obama administration~’s approach — the imposition of steadily more debilitating sanctions — may yet work. There~’s a chance, albeit slim, that he may be right: New sanctions are just beginning to bite and, combined with an intensified cyberwar and sabotage efforts, they might prove costly enough to deter Tehran.&#xD;

There is a real danger that investor uncertainty will inhibit investment in future gas supplies. If the shale gas revolution can be continued and replicated this does not matter. Shale gas can provide abundant supplies of cheap natural gas. However, if it disappoints then, as the 2010 report notes, in five to ten years gas markets could face significant shortages as a result of the very long lead times on upstream gas projects.&#xD;

Plan&#xD;
&#xD;
====The United States federal government should lessen restrictions on natural gas production in the Environmental Protection Agency~’s New Source Performance Standards and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants Reviews.====&#xD;
Advantage 1 is Manufacturing&#xD;
&#xD;
**====Natural gas prices are low and stable—-production is high—-that spurs a renaissance in US manufacturing and chemical production====**&#xD;

Increased availability and low prices of natural gas have significant implications for domestic manufacturing, &#xD;
AND&#xD;
and increased natural gas supplies also have the potential to stabilize prices.22&#xD;

The use of Pakistani nuclear weapons could trigger a chain reaction. Nuclear-armed India, an ancient enemy, could respond in kind. China, India~’s hated foe, could react if India used her nuclear weapons, triggering a nuclear holocaust on the subcontinent. If any of either Russia or America~’s 2, 250 strategic weapons on hair-trigger alert were launched either accidentally or purposefully in response, nuclear winter would ensue, meaning the end of most life on earth.&#xD;

UNDER THE YOKE: EUROPE~’S NATURAL GAS DEPENDENCY ON RUSSIA&#xD;
Rising shale gas supplies have significantly reduced U.S. requirements for LNG, a move that has already had geopolitical implications. This shift has played a key role in weakening Russia~’s ability to wield an ~’energy weapon~’ over its European customers by offering European customers an alternative supply in the form of LNG displaced from the U.S. market.80&#xD;

&#xD;
====The United States federal government should reduce construction and annual licensing fee restrictions in the United States that prevent expansion of small modular nuclear reactors.====&#xD;
Contention One is Warming&#xD;
&#xD;
====Nuclear~’s inevitable globally but won~’t solve warming until the US develops SMR~’s ====&#xD;
**Shellenberger 12** – et al and Ted Nordhaus—co-founders of American Environics and the Breakthrough Institute a think tank that works on energy and climate change – AND – Jesse Jenkins-Director of Energy and Climate Policy, the Breakthrough Institute (Michael, Why We Need Radical Innovation to Make New Nuclear Energy Cheap, 9/11, thebreakthrough.org/index.php/programs/energy-and-climate/new-nukes/)&#xD;
Arguably, the biggest impact of Fukushima on the nuclear debate, ironically, has &#xD;
AND&#xD;
than developing the nuclear technologies we will need to get that job done.&#xD;
&#xD;
====Nuclear~’s critical to displace coal and stop catastrophic climate change ====&#xD;
**Moore 4**—co-founder of Greenpeace, is chairman and chief scientist of Greenspirit Strategies Ltd.

In the early 1970s when I helped found Greenpeace, I believed that nuclear energy &#xD;
AND&#xD;
gas emissions. Every responsible environmentalist should support a move in that direction.&#xD;
&#xD;
====The plan solves the only major roadblock to the creation of a robust domestic SMR industry====&#xD;
**Loris 11 **Nicolas D, Research Associate in the Roe Institute, Jack Spencer – Research Fellow in Nuclear Energy in the Thomas A.

Abstract: More and more companies—in the U.S. and abroad&#xD;

This is Why Reducing Emissions is Critical¶ We~’re not yet committed to surpassing 2&#xD;
AND&#xD;
Earth than today~’s, but we still can and must limit the damage.&#xD;
Contention Two is Advocacy&#xD;
&#xD;
====Debating energy policy joins members of different fields and philosophies to create a consciousness shift towards sustainable environmental policy – how students are trained matters immensely to public policy====&#xD;
**Crist 4** (Eileen, Professor at Virginia Tech in the Department of Science and Technology, &amp;#34;Against the social construction of nature and wilderness&amp;#34;, Environmental Ethics 26;1, p 13-6, http://www.sts.vt.edu/faculty/crist/againstsocialconstruction.pdf)&#xD;
Yet, constructivist analyses of &amp;#34;nature&amp;#34; favor remaining in the comfort zone of &#xD;
AND&#xD;
the world at an hour that is pressingly calling us to change it.&#xD;
&#xD;
====Switch side debate empirically inculcates portable skills that lead to better energy policy – it gives voice to buried arguments and challenges bias and institutional affiliations====&#xD;
**Mitchell 10** (Gordon R, Associate Professor and Director of Graduate Studies in the Department of Communication at the University of Pittsburgh, where he also directs the William Pitt Debating Union, &amp;#34;SWITCH-SIDE DEBATING MEETS DEMAND-DRIVEN RHETORIC OF SCIENCE&amp;#34;, [[http://www.pitt.edu/~~gordonm/JPubs/Mitchell2010.pdf-http://www.pitt.edu/~gordonm/JPubs/Mitchell2010.pdf]])&#xD;
An additional dimension of nuance emerging from this avenue of analysis pertains to the precise &#xD;
AND&#xD;
paradigms of policy planning with situated, contingent judgments informed by reflective deliberation.&#xD;
&#xD;
====Switch side debate over energy policy is a reflexive forum that facilitates effective decision-making and deliberation====&#xD;
**Mitchell 10** (Gordon R, Associate Professor and Director of Graduate Studies in the Department of Communication at the University of Pittsburgh, where he also directs the William Pitt Debating Union, &amp;#34;SWITCH-SIDE DEBATING MEETS DEMAND-DRIVEN RHETORIC OF SCIENCE&amp;#34;, [[http://www.pitt.edu/~~gordonm/JPubs/Mitchell2010.pdf-http://www.pitt.edu/~gordonm/JPubs/Mitchell2010.pdf]])&#xD;
Yet the picture grows more complex when one considers what is happening over at the &#xD;
AND&#xD;
where debating exercises are designed to facilitate, not frustrate, deliberative goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
====Taking action against warming represents an opportunity to rebuild progressive politics for a better society – we must set aside differences based on identity in favor of a broad-based coalition====&#xD;

I admit I have arrived late to the party. Only recently have I begun &#xD;
AND&#xD;
said to me, &amp;#34;God help us, I hope you~’re right.&amp;#34;&#xD;
&#xD;
====Engagement within the existing system of market mechanisms is necessary to avoid reproducing the status quo====&#xD;
**Bryant 12**—professor of philosophy at Collin College (Levi, We~’ll Never Do Better Than a Politician: Climate Change and Purity, 5/11/12, http://larvalsubjects.wordpress.com/2012/05/11/well-never-do-better-than-a-politician-climate-change-and-purity/) &#xD;
However, pointing this out and deriding market based solutions doesn~’t get us very far&#xD;
AND&#xD;
there~’s no way around this, and we do need to act now.&#xD;
&#xD;
====The discourse of environmental action must be attached to the state garner public support and lead to policy action====&#xD;

&#xD;
Plan&#xD;
&#xD;
====The United States federal government should lessen restrictions on natural gas production in the Environmental Protection Agency~’s New Source Performance Standards and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants Reviews.====&#xD;
Advantage 1 is Russia&#xD;
&#xD;
**====There~’s a large natural gas supply now====**&#xD;
**Buurma 10-25 – **Christine Buurma, writer for Businessweek, October 25th, 2012, &amp;#34;Natural Gas Declines After Bigger-Than-Average Supply Increase&amp;#34; [[www.businessweek.com/printer/articles/351414?type=bloomberg-http://www.businessweek.com/printer/articles/351414?type=bloomberg]]&#xD;
Natural gas futures dropped to a two-week low in New York after a &#xD;
AND&#xD;
Boston may be 52 degrees, also 9 more than the usual reading.&#xD;
&#xD;
**====US gas supply is key to prevent Russian energy leverage over Europe====**&#xD;
**Koven 12 – **Colonel Alexander L. Koven, United States Air Force, United States Army War College, January 3rd, 2012, &amp;#34;Under the Yoke: Europe~’s Natural Gas Dependency on Russia,&amp;#34; [[www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2%26doc=GetTRDoc.pdf%26AD=ADA561551-http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2%26doc=GetTRDoc.pdf%26AD=ADA561551]]&#xD;
UNDER THE YOKE: EUROPE~’S NATURAL GAS DEPENDENCY ON RUSSIA&#xD;
Rising shale gas supplies have significantly reduced U.S. requirements for LNG, a move that has already had geopolitical implications. This shift has played a key role in weakening Russia~’s ability to wield an ~’energy weapon~’ over its European customers by offering European customers an alternative supply in the form of LNG displaced from the U.S. market.80&#xD;
&#xD;
====The plan reduces US gas imports and frees up the global market – allows Europe to lessen its dependence on Russian gas====&#xD;
**Jaffe %26 O~’Sullivan 12** – Amy Myers Jaffe is the Wallace S. Wilson Fellow in Energy Studies at the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy at Rice University, and Meghan L. O~’Sullivan is the Jeane Kirkpatrick Professor of the Practice of International Affairs at the John F. Kennedy School at Harvard University. &amp;#34;The Geopolitics of Natural Gas,&amp;#34; July, http://bakerinstitute.org/publications/EF-pub-HKSGeopoliticsOfNaturalGas-073012.pdf&#xD;
Knowledge of the shale gas resource is not new. Geologists have known about the &#xD;
AND&#xD;
until lower-cost Iraqi gas is able to flow into the line.&#xD;
&#xD;
====European gas independence from Russia solves Russian aggression, terrorism, and EU relations====&#xD;
**Medlock et al. 11 – **Dr. Kenneth B. Medlock, Ph.D. in economics, fellow in Energy and Resource Economics at the Baker Institute, and former advisor to the U.S. Department of Energy and the California Energy Commission, AND*** Amy Myers Jaffe, graduate from Princeton University, fellow of Energy Studies and director of the Energy Forum at the Baker Institute, and associate director of the Rice Energy Program, AND*** Dr. Peter R. Hartley, Ph.D in economics at Rice University, July 2011, &amp;#34;Shale Gas and U.S. National Security,&amp;#34; http://bakerinstitute.org/publications/EF-pub-DOEShaleGas-07192011.pdf&#xD;
The dramatic lessening of Europe~’s dependence on Russian gas will likely have considerable geopolitical implications &#xD;
AND&#xD;
and other international initiatives that might not have the full support of Russia. &#xD;
&#xD;
====Russian aggression causes nuclear war====&#xD;
**Blank 9** – Dr. Stephen Blank is a Research Professor of National Security Affairs at the Strategic Studies Institute of the U.S. Army War College, March 2009, &amp;#34;Russia And Arms Control: Are There Opportunities For The Obama Administration?&amp;#34; http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/pub908.pdf&#xD;
Proliferators or nuclear states like China and Russia can then deter regional or intercontinental attacks &#xD;
AND&#xD;
perhaps make wars of aggression on their neighbors or their own people.172&#xD;
&#xD;
====There~’s a high risk of nuclear terrorism – causes extinction====&#xD;
**Hellman 8** ~~[Martin E. Hellman, emeritus prof of engineering @ Stanford, &amp;#34;Risk Analysis of Nuclear Deterrence&amp;#34; SPRING 2008 THE BENT OF TAU BETA PI, http://www.nuclearrisk.org/paper.pdf~~]&#xD;
The threat of nuclear terrorism looms much larger in the public~’s mind than the threat &#xD;
AND&#xD;
assume that  preventing World War III is a necessity—not an option. &#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
====Energy dominance allows Russia to thwart NATO====&#xD;
**Blank 9** Stephen - Strategic Studies Institute, US Army War College, September 2009, &amp;#34;Russia~’s Energy Weapon and European Security.,&amp;#34; www.acus.org/files/StephenBlank-RussiaEnergy.pdf&#xD;
Similarly abundant evidence exists that Moscow has used and continues to use energy as an instrument of dominance in the CIS as a whole and of leverage in Europe, either by controlling pipelines from Eurasia to Russia and then Europe or by maximizing its control of gas supplies from Russia (including those Central Asian supplies) to Europe.&#xD;
Moscow~’s frequent resort to energy punishments to get its way testifies to its view of energy as a primary lever of policy. This use of punishment does not end at the CIS~’ borders even though it is most frequently employed there. Indeed, it has also regularly been employed against the Baltic States and in Central and Eastern Europe.&#xD;
For instance, in the summer of 2008 Moscow cut off gas to the Czech &#xD;
AND&#xD;
amount of contracted gas given its depleted treasury due to the current crisis.&#xD;
  It is doing so to ensure that either Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko or opposition &#xD;
AND&#xD;
-Russian&amp;#34; policies and essentially demanding a change of government in Kyiv.&#xD;
9   In earlier statements the Russian government has also denied that Ukraine is a truly &#xD;
AND&#xD;
onto Russia. Thus Ukraine would cease to exist as a state. 10&#xD;
Putin also said that Russia regards NATO enlargement as a threat, so if Georgia received membership, Moscow would &amp;#34;take adequate measures&amp;#34; and recognize Abkhazia and South Ossetia to create a buffer between NATO and Russia. 11  So we cannot say that we have not been warned what Moscow wants and what it might do if it so chose.&#xD;
&#xD;
====NATO prevents global nuclear war ====&#xD;
Zbigniew **Brzezinski 9**, former U.S. National Security Advisor, the Robert E. Osgood Professor of American Foreign Policy at Johns Hopkins University~’s School of Advanced International Studies, September/October 2009, &amp;#34;An Agenda for NATO,&amp;#34; Foreign Affairs &#xD;
And yet, it is fair to ask: Is NATO living up to its extraordinary potential? NATO today is without a doubt the most powerful military and political alliance in the world. Its 28 members come from the globe~’s two most productive, technologically advanced, socially modern, economically prosperous, and politically democratic regions. Its member states~’ 900 million people account for only 13 percent of the world~’s population but 45 percent of global GDP. &#xD;
NATO~’s potential is not primarily military. Although NATO is a collective-security alliance&#xD;
AND&#xD;
geopolitical bond between the United States and Europe as it addresses new tasks.&#xD;
The basic challenge that NATO now confronts is that there are historically unprecedented risks to &#xD;
AND&#xD;
the growing threat of violent political chaos stemming from humanity~’s recent political awakening.&#xD;
The three great political contests of the twentieth century (the two world wars and &#xD;
AND&#xD;
television, and the Internet accelerated and intensified this mass global political awakening. &#xD;
In its early stages, such new political awareness tends to be expressed as a &#xD;
AND&#xD;
and religiously aroused peoples, is where NATO is becoming more deeply embroiled. &#xD;
Additionally complicating is the fact that the dramatic rise of China and India and the &#xD;
AND&#xD;
these three still relatively cautious revisionist powers will further intensify the strategic uncertainty.&#xD;
Visible on the horizon but not as powerful are the emerging regional rebels, with &#xD;
AND&#xD;
an extremist anti-Western religious movement is threatening the country~’s political stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
**====US gas production collapses Gazprom ====**&#xD;
Aslund 9-27 – Anders Åslund has been a senior fellow at the Peterson &#xD;
AND&#xD;
&#xD;
Gazprom, the natural gas company controlled by the Russian state, is in crisis&#xD;
AND&#xD;
eastern Europe, although oil and gas prices have delinked on the market.&#xD;
&#xD;
====Gazprom leads to Arctic drilling oil spills====&#xD;
**ENS 12** – Environment News Service, August 27th, 2012, &amp;#34;Greenpeace Battles Gazprom Over Russia~’s Arctic Drill Rig&amp;#34; ens-newswire.com/2012/08/27/greenpeace-battles-gazprom-over-russias-arctic-drill-rig/&#xD;
Gazprom, the world~’s largest natural gas company, has big plans for oil and &#xD;
AND&#xD;
are so eager to take action against Gazprom in the icy Arctic waters.&#xD;
&#xD;
====That kills Arctic biodiversity====&#xD;
**O~’Rourke 12 – **Ronal O~’Rourke, specialist in naval affairs, June 15^^th^^, 2012, &amp;#34;Changes in the Arctic: Background and Issues for Congress&amp;#34; http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R41153.pdf&#xD;
No oil spill is entirely benign. Even a relatively minor spill, depending on &#xD;
AND&#xD;
the species have longer life spans and reproduce at a slower rate.95&#xD;
&#xD;
====Extinction====&#xD;
CAFF 98 – Biodiversity Working group of the Arctic Council, Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna, September 1998, &amp;#34;Strategic Plan for the Conservation of Arctic Biological Diversity&amp;#34; http://arcticportal.org/uploads/RX/zN/RXzNc4KU8QKfhN_KDw_oQQ/The-StrategicPlanforTheConservofArcticBiolDiv.pdf&#xD;
The species of the Arctic are important for their own sake and for their value&#xD;
AND&#xD;
these species may require co-operative efforts with non-Arctic countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
Advantage 2 is Manufacturing&#xD;
&#xD;
**====Natural gas prices are low and stable—-production is high—-that spurs a renaissance in US manufacturing and chemical production====**&#xD;
**Yergin 10-22** – Daniel is a Pulitzer Prize winning American author, speaker, and economic researcher. Yergin is the co-founder and chairman of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, an energy research consultancy that is now part of IHS Inc.. &amp;#34;Daniel Yergin: The Real Stimulus: Low-Cost Natural Gas,&amp;#34; 2012, http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444734804578062331199029850.html&#xD;
An unconventional oil and gas revolution is under way in the United States, but &#xD;
AND&#xD;
the years ahead be offset by cheap energy in the U.S.&#xD;
&#xD;
====Low prices are stabilizing and key to long-term investment====&#xD;
**CCES 12** – Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, May 2012, &amp;#34;Natural Gas in the Industrial Sector,&amp;#34; [[www.c2es.org/docUploads/natural-gas-industrial-sector.pdf-http://www.c2es.org/docUploads/natural-gas-industrial-sector.pdf]]&#xD;
Increased availability and low prices of natural gas have significant implications for domestic manufacturing, &#xD;
AND&#xD;
and increased natural gas supplies also have the potential to stabilize prices.22&#xD;
&#xD;
**====They~’re key to manufacturing and the chemical industry====**&#xD;
**PWC 11** – PwC~’s Industrial Products (IP) practice provides financial, operational, and strategic services to global organizations.

The first key implication derived from the analysis of trends in Asia suggests that American &#xD;
AND&#xD;
air power will of necessity be the primary instruments constituting the American response. &#xD;

====Low prices are key to the steel industry====&#xD;
**IHS 11** (IHS Global Insight - leading economic analysis and forecasting firm, December 2011, &amp;#34;The Economic and Employment Contributions of Shale Gas in the United States,&amp;#34; anga.us/media/235626/shale-gas-economic-impact-dec-2011.pdf)&#xD;
Energy from electricity or natural gas makes up a higher proportion of the value of &#xD;

&#xD;
====Extinction====&#xD;
**Caldicott 2** (Helen Caldicott, Founder, Physicians for Social Responsibility, THE NEW NUCLEAR DANGER, 2002, p. xii)&#xD;
The use of Pakistani nuclear weapons could trigger a chain reaction. Nuclear-armed India, an ancient enemy, could respond in kind. China, India~’s hated foe, could react if India used her nuclear weapons, triggering a nuclear holocaust on the subcontinent. If any of either Russia or America~’s 2, 250 strategic weapons on hair-trigger alert were launched either accidentally or purposefully in response, nuclear winter would ensue, meaning the end of most life on earth.&#xD;

Stevens August 2012 – Professor Paul Stevens is Senior Research Fellow for Energy at Chatham &#xD;
AND&#xD;
/Research/Energy, Environment and Development/bp0812_stevens.pdf&#xD;
There is a real danger that investor uncertainty will inhibit investment in future gas supplies. If the shale gas revolution can be continued and replicated this does not matter. Shale gas can provide abundant supplies of cheap natural gas. However, if it disappoints then, as the 2010 report notes, in five to ten years gas markets could face significant shortages as a result of the very long lead times on upstream gas projects.&#xD;
&#xD;
====And independently, the restrictions destroy independent producers, which are key to the industry====&#xD;
**Banerjee 12 – **Neela Banerjee, writer for the Los Angeles Times, April 18th, 2012, &amp;#34;New EPA rules target pollution at fracking sites&amp;#34; articles.latimes.com/2012/apr/18/business/la-fi-epa-drilling-20120419&#xD;

Don Briggs, president of the Louisiana Oil and Gas Association, called the regulations &#xD;
AND&#xD;
85 percent of all wells in the United States would be shut down.&amp;#34;&#xD;

The Horn of Africa is a dangerous and strategically vital place. Small wars, which rage continuously, can easily escalate into big wars. Local conflicts have regional and global aspects.

Taiwan escalates and goes nuclear—-no defense

Taiwan is the most likely potential crisis that could trigger a nuclear war between China and the US, a new academic report concludes.
&amp;#34;Taiwan remains the single most plausible and dangerous source of tension and conflict between the US and China,&amp;#34; says the 42-page report by the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).
Prepared by the CSIS~’ Project on Nuclear Issues and resulting from a year-long study, the report emphasizes that Beijing continues to be set on a policy to prevent Taiwan~’s independence, while at the same time the US maintains the capability to come to Taiwan~’s defense.
&amp;#34;Although tensions across the Taiwan Strait have subsided since both Taipei and Beijing embraced a policy of engagement in 2008, the situation remains combustible, complicated by rapidly diverging cross-strait military capabilities and persistent political disagreements,&amp;#34; the report says.
In a footnote, it quotes senior fellow at the US Council on Foreign Relations Richard Betts describing Taiwan as &amp;#34;the main potential flashpoint for the US in East Asia.&amp;#34;
The report also quotes Betts as saying that neither Beijing nor Washington can fully control developments that might ignite a Taiwan crisis.
&amp;#34;This is a classic recipe for surprise, miscalculation and uncontrolled escalation,&amp;#34; Betts wrote in a separate study of his own.
The CSIS study says: &amp;#34;For the foreseeable future Taiwan is the contingency in which nuclear weapons would most likely become a major factor, because the fate of the island is intertwined both with the legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party and the reliability of US defense commitments in the Asia-Pacific region.&amp;#34;
Titled Nuclear Weapons and US-China Relations, the study says disputes in the East and South China seas appear unlikely to lead to major conflict between China and the US, but they do &amp;#34;provide kindling&amp;#34; for potential conflict between the two nations because the disputes implicate a number of important regional interests, including the interests of treaty allies of the US.
The danger posed by flashpoints such as Taiwan, the Korean Peninsula and maritime demarcation disputes is magnified by the potential for mistakes, the study says.
&amp;#34;Although Beijing and Washington have agreed to a range of crisis management mechanisms, such as the Military Maritime Consultative Agreement and the establishment of a direct hotline between the Pentagon and the Ministry of Defense, the bases for miscommunication and misunderstanding remain and draw on deep historical reservoirs of suspicion,&amp;#34; the report says.
For example, it says, it is unclear whether either side understands what kinds of actions would result in a military or even nuclear response by the other party.
To make things worse, &amp;#34;neither side seems to believe the other~’s declared policies and intentions, suggesting that escalation management, already a very uncertain endeavor, could be especially difficult in any conflict,&amp;#34; it says.
Although conflict &amp;#34;mercifully&amp;#34; seems unlikely at this point, the report concludes that &amp;#34;it cannot be ruled out and may become increasingly likely if we are unwise or unlucky.&amp;#34;
The report says: &amp;#34;With both sides possessing and looking set to retain formidable nuclear weapons arsenals, such a conflict would be tremendously dangerous and quite possibly devastating.&amp;#34;
Russia aggression goes nuclear

====Contrary evidence is unqualified and funded by oil hacks====
**Prothero 12** ~~[Donald R. Prothero, Professor of Geology at Occidental College and Lecturer in Geobiology at the California Institute of Technology, 3-1-2012, &amp;#34;How We Know Global Warming is Real and Human Caused,&amp;#34; Skeptic, 17.2, EBSCO~~]
How do we know that global warming is real and primarily human caused? There 
AND
change when it threatens their survival. Neither can we as a society.

====The plan solves for global emissions====
**Kammen 7** – Professor of Public Policy @ UC Berkeley (Daniel, &amp;#34;Green Jobs Created by Global Warming Initiative,&amp;#34; September 25th, http://www.unep.org/civil_society/GCSF9/pdfs/karmen-senate.pdf)
In addition to supporting domestic job creation, clean energy is an important and fastest 
AND
and the actions of a number of emerging economies to ~’go green~’.

====It is not too late to reverse warming – taking action now is critical – the alternative to reducing emissions is mass death====
**Nuccitelli 12 –** Dana, environmental scientist at a private environmental consulting firm in Sacramento and has a Bachelor~’s Degree in astrophysics from the University of California at Berkeley, and a Master~’s Degree in physics from the University of California at Davis, 2012, &amp;#34;Realistically What Might The Future Climate Look Like?&amp;#34;, http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2012/09/01/784931/realistically-what-might-the-future-climate-look-like/
This is Why Reducing Emissions is Critical¶ We~’re not yet committed to surpassing 2
AND
Earth than today~’s, but we still can and must limit the damage.

====Continued reliance on coal kills 13,000 people every year and spreads hazardous pollution====
**Zelman 11** Joanna, The Huffington Post, &amp;#34;Power Plant Air Pollution Kills 13,000 People Per Year, Coal-Fired Are Most Hazardous: ALA Report&amp;#34;, 3/15, www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/03/14/power-plant-air-pollution-coal-kills_n_833385.html
The American Lung Association (ALA) recently released a new report on the dramatic 
AND
respiratory illnesses connected to pollutant emissions totaled over %24185 billion per year.
Contention Two is Advocacy

====Debating energy policy joins members of different fields and philosophies to create a consciousness shift towards sustainable environmental policy – how students are trained matters immensely to public policy====
**Crist 4** (Eileen, Professor at Virginia Tech in the Department of Science and Technology, &amp;#34;Against the social construction of nature and wilderness&amp;#34;, Environmental Ethics 26;1, p 13-6, http://www.sts.vt.edu/faculty/crist/againstsocialconstruction.pdf)
Yet, constructivist analyses of &amp;#34;nature&amp;#34; favor remaining in the comfort zone of 
AND
the world at an hour that is pressingly calling us to change it.

====Debate empirically inculcates portable skills that lead to better energy policy – it gives voice to buried arguments and challenges bias and institutional affiliations====
**Mitchell 10** (Gordon R, Associate Professor and Director of Graduate Studies in the Department of Communication at the University of Pittsburgh, where he also directs the William Pitt Debating Union, &amp;#34;SWITCH-SIDE DEBATING MEETS DEMAND-DRIVEN RHETORIC OF SCIENCE&amp;#34;, [[http://www.pitt.edu/~~gordonm/JPubs/Mitchell2010.pdf-http://www.pitt.edu/~gordonm/JPubs/Mitchell2010.pdf]])
An additional dimension of nuance emerging from this avenue of analysis pertains to the precise 
AND
paradigms of policy planning with situated, contingent judgments informed by reflective deliberation.

====Debate over energy policy is a reflexive forum that facilitates effective decision-making and deliberation====
**Mitchell 10** (Gordon R, Associate Professor and Director of Graduate Studies in the Department of Communication at the University of Pittsburgh, where he also directs the William Pitt Debating Union, &amp;#34;SWITCH-SIDE DEBATING MEETS DEMAND-DRIVEN RHETORIC OF SCIENCE&amp;#34;, [[http://www.pitt.edu/~~gordonm/JPubs/Mitchell2010.pdf-http://www.pitt.edu/~gordonm/JPubs/Mitchell2010.pdf]])
Yet the picture grows more complex when one considers what is happening over at the 
AND
where debating exercises are designed to facilitate, not frustrate, deliberative goals.

====The state is an inevitable and indispensable part of the solution to warming ====
**Eckersley 4** Robyn, Reader/Associate Professor in the Department of Political Science at the University of Melbourne, &amp;#34;The Green State: Rethinking Democracy and Sovereignty&amp;#34;, MIT Press, 2004, Google Books, pp. 3-8
While acknowledging the basis for this antipathy toward the nation- state, and the 
AND
at least as a potentially more significant ally in the green cause.17

====The discourse of environmental action must be attached to the state garner public support and lead to policy action====
~~[Note: EM = ecological modernization~~]
**Doran and Barry 6 **– worked at all levels in the environment and sustainable development policy arena - at the United Nations, at the Northern Ireland Assembly and Dáil Éireann, and in the Irish NGO sector. PhD—AND— Reader in Politics, Queen~’s University School of Politics, International Studies, and Philosophy.

Viewed in isolation EM can be painted as a reformist and limited strategy for achieving 
AND
~’greenprint~’ of an abstract and utopian vision of the ~’sustainable society~’. 

====Public advocacy is key to effective action on climate change====
**CAG 10**—Climate Change Communication Advisory Group.

This short advisory paper collates a set of recommendations about how best to shape mass 
AND
they would like structural barriers to behavioural/societal change to be removed.

====Taking action against warming represents an opportunity to rebuild progressive politics for a better society – we must set aside differences based on identity in favor of a broad-based coalition====
**Smith 10** Brendan, co-founder of Labor Network for Sustainability, 11-23, &amp;#34;Fighting Doom: The New Politics of Climate Change,&amp;#34; Common Dreams, http://www.commondreams.org/view/2010/11/23-1
I admit I have arrived late to the party. Only recently have I begun 
AND
said to me, &amp;#34;God help us, I hope you~’re right.&amp;#34;

====Engagement within the existing system of market mechanisms is necessary to avoid reproducing the status quo====
**Bryant 12**—professor of philosophy at Collin College (Levi, We~’ll Never Do Better Than a Politician: Climate Change and Purity, 5/11/12, http://larvalsubjects.wordpress.com/2012/05/11/well-never-do-better-than-a-politician-climate-change-and-purity/) 
However, pointing this out and deriding market based solutions doesn~’t get us very far
AND
there~’s no way around this, and we do need to act now.

====Simulation and institutional deliberation motivate effective responses to climate risks====
**Marx et al. 7** (Sabine M, Center for Research on Environmental Decisions (CRED) @ Columbia University, Elke U. Weber, Graduate School of Business and Department of Psychology @ Columbia University, Benjamin S. Orlovea, Department of Environmental Science and Policy @ University of California Davis, Anthony Leiserowitz, Decision Research, David H.

Based on the observation that experiential and analytic processing systems compete and that personal experience 
AND
engage both systems in the process of individual and group decision-making.

====Science is a process – it subjects itself to constant refinement based on empirical evidence – we can make sufficient contingent claims about the world====
**Hutcheon 93**—former prof of sociology of education at U Regina and U British Columbia. Former research advisor to the Health Promotion Branch of the Canadian Department of Health and Welfare and as a director of the Vanier Institute of the Family.

(Pat, A Critique of &amp;#34;Biology as Ideology: The Doctrine of DNA&amp;#34;, http://www.humanists.net/pdhutcheon/humanist%20articles/lewontn.htm)
The introductory lecture in this series articulated the increasingly popular &amp;#34;postmodernist&amp;#34; claim that

powerful as this hunger for modernization or it is condemned to repeated failure.

Fear mobilizes action
Raino Malnes 8, Department of Political Science, University of Oslo, Norway, Climate science and the way we ought to think about danger, Environmental Politics, Volume 17, Issue 4 August 2008 , pages 660 - 672
The upshot is that efforts to boost the credibility of the greenhouse theory are liable to backfire. Scientific dissenters are likely to speak up loudly, and those with political or economic interest in dismissing the danger of climate change will benefit from this turn of the debate. They need not take on the arduous task of arguing that adverse effects of human activity are too unlikely to be worth worrying about. All they have to do is disprove that adversity is a foregone conclusion. A memo from a Republican politician in the United States illustrates the last point. Articulated as a defence of President Bush&amp;#39;s resistance to greenhouse gas reductions, it says: &amp;#39;Should the public come to believe that the scientific issues are settled, their views about global warming will change accordingly. Therefore, you need to continue to make the lack of scientific certainty a primary issue in the debate&amp;#39; (quoted from Lanchester 2007, p. 5)
It is in many ways unfortunate that scientists who try to pass the greenhouse theory for certified truth open the door to this kind of argumentation. They play into the hands of those who are out to disparage the theory by allowing them to trade on its margin of error. But lack of certainty is, as we have seen, no embarrassment to the theory and no reason not to act on its dire predictions.
Generally speaking, the line between pseudo-danger and real danger is crossed long 
AND
reality playing for time&amp;#39; (quoted from Lanchester 2007, p. 3).
Enviro Prag Good – Warming
Pragmatic warming policy is effective and key to prevent extinction~-~--the K results in disengagement and endless theoretical uncertainty that debilitates action~-~--only the perm can bridge the gap
Simpson 10 (Francis, College of Engineering, Vanderbilt University, “Environmental Pragmatism and its Application to Climate Change The Moral Obligations of Developed and Developing Nations to Avert Climate Change as viewed through Technological Pragmatism”, Spring 2010 | Volume 6 | Number 1)
Pragmatism and Footprinting

Dickerson 10 – Lieutenant Colonel Sergio M. Dickerson, 2010, &amp;#34;United States Security Strategy Towards Cuba,&amp;#34; Strategy Research Project, www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2anddoc=GetTRDoc.pdfandAD=ADA518053
Conclusion¶ Today, 20 years have passed since the fall of the Berlin Wall 
AND
decline in the greater global order bringing true peace for years to come.
Obama weakness causes global conflict
Coes 11 – Ben Coes 11, a former speechwriter in the George H.W. Bush administration, managed Mitt Romney’s successful campaign for Massachusetts Governor in 2002 and author, “The disease of a weak president”, The Daily Caller, http://dailycaller.com/2011/09/30/the-disease-of-a-weak-president/
The disease of a weak president usually begins with the Achilles’ heel all politicians are 
AND
one or the other. The status quo is simply not an option.
Engagement is inevitable, it’s a question of effectiveness~-~--Obama’s credibility solves South China Seas conflict and Russia resurgence
Ghitis 13 (Frida, world affairs columnist for The Miami Herald and World Politics Review. A former CNN producer and correspondent, she is the author of The End of Revolution: A Changing World in the Age of Live Television. “World to Obama: You can&amp;#39;t ignore us,” 1/22, http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/22/opinion/ghitis-obama-world)
President Obama made it very clear: The second term is all about the domestic 
AND
with the best laid, most well-intentioned plans of American presidents.
South China Sea conflict causes nuclear war
Wittner 11 (Lawrence S. Wittner, Emeritus Professor of History at the State University of New York/Albany, Wittner is the author of eight books, the editor or co-editor of another four, and the author of over 250 published articles and book reviews.

Proliferators or nuclear states like China and Russia can then deter regional or intercontinental attacks 
AND
perhaps make wars of aggression on their neighbors or their own people.172
1AC Economy
Cuban oil dependence on Venezuela is unsustainable~-~--Venezuela will cut off supplies
Keppel 3/16 (Stephen, ABC News, “What Chávez&amp;#39;s Death Means for Cuba, Venezuela and the U.S.” http://abcnews.go.com/ABC_Univision/chavezs-death-means-cuba-venezuela-us/story?id=18669003)
Upon hearing news of the death of Hugo Chávez, scores of Venezuelans gathered in

The power and hydrocarbon sectors are inextricably linked, as Cuba produces about 85 percent 
AND
uses; this is consistent with the usage breakdown seen in other countries.
US-Cuban oil cooperation is key to revitalize their domestic oil sector
Benjamin-Alvadaro 6 (Jonathan, Report for the Cuban Research Institute, Florida International University, PhD, Professor of Political Science at University of Nebraska at Omaha, Director of the Intelligence Community Centers of Academic Excellence Program at UNO, Treasurer of the American Political Science Association, “The Current Status and Future Prospects for Oil Exploration in Cuba: A Special,” http://cri.fiu.edu/research/commissioned-reports/oil-cuba-alvarado.pdf)
Why is it important to clarify the current status of Cuban energy in the face 
AND
confidence, trust and cooperation in this critical issue area across the region. 
The plan solves Cuban dependence on Venezuela~-~--revenues lead to political reforms that create stability
Pinon 11 – Jorge R. Piñón is a visiting research fellow at the Latin American and Caribbean Center’s Cuban Research Institute at FIU.

If Cuba’s suspected but yet undiscovered hydrocarbon reserves are proven real, it will take 
AND

Cuban instability collapse causes Latin American instability, terrorism, democratic backsliding, and distracts the US from critical hotspots including Africa, the Caucus, and North Korea 
Gorrell 5 (Tim, Lieutenant Colonel, “CUBA: THE NEXT UNANTICIPATED ANTICIPATED STRATEGIC CRISIS?” 3/18, http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA433074)
Regardless of the succession, under the current U.S. policy, Cuba’s 
AND
in an effort to facilitate a manageable transition to post-Castro Cuba?
Caucus instability causes nuclear war
Blank 2k – MacArthur Professor of Research @ The Strategic Studies Institute @ US Army War College (Stephen, “U.S. MILITARY ENGAGEMENT WITH TRANSCAUCASIA AND CENTRAL ASIA,” June, http://www.bits.de/NRANEU/docs/Blank2000.pdf)
In 1993 Moscow even threatened World War III to deter Turkish intervention on behalf of 
AND
(5) neither has willing proxies capable of settling the situation.74 

Korean instability causes nuclear war
Chol 11 Kim Myong Chol is author of a number of books and papers in Korean, Japanese and English on North Korea, including Kim Jong-il&amp;#39;s Strategy for Reunification. He has a PhD from the Democratic People&amp;#39;s Republic of Korea&amp;#39;s Academy of Social Sciences &amp;#34;Dangerous games&amp;#34; Aug 20 www.atimes.com/atimes/Korea/MH20Dg01.html
The divided and heavily armed Korean Peninsula remains the most inflammable global flashpoint, with 
AND
each spewing as much radioactive fallout as 150-180 H-bombs. 

Caribbean terrorism leads to attack on the US~-~--they’ll use bioweapons
Bryan 1 (Anthony T. Bryan, director of the North-South Center’s Caribbean Program, 10-21-2001. CFR, Terrorism, Porous Borders, and Homeland Security: The Case for U.S.-Caribbean Cooperation, p.

He previously worked at the Center for Biosecurity and holds an MBA from Duke University. “Reducing the Risk of Human Extinction,” Risk Analysis Vol. 27, No. 5, http://users.physics.harvard.edu/~wilson/pmpmta/Mahoney_extinction.pdf
Of current extinction risks, the most severe may be bioterrorism. The knowledge needed 
AND
to respond to pandemics (Lam, Franco, and Shuler, 2006).
Latin American democracy solves environmental destruction
Callejas 10 (Danny, Professor of Economics at the Universidad de Antioquia, Colombia, “Democracy and Environmental Quality in Latin America: A Panel System of Equations Approach, 1995-2008,” November)
Democracy has a positive effect on environmental quality. The theory suggests that democracy sustains 
AND
results suggest that democracy and education have a positive effect on environmental quality.
Extinction
Takacs 96 (David, Philosophies of Paradise, The Johns Hopkins Univ. Pr., Baltimore)
&amp;#34;Habitat destruction and conversion are eliminating species at such a frightening pace that extinction 
AND
the famines could lead to a thermonuclear war, which could extinguish civilization.&amp;#34;&amp;#34;
1AC Solvency
The Secretary of the Treasury can modify the embargo to allow drilling
Huddleston 9 (Vicki Huddleston, deputy assistant secretary of defense for Africa at the Department of Defense, visiting fellow at Brookings and co-director of the Brookings Project on U.S. Policy Toward a Cuba in Transition from 2007 to 2009, Carlos Pascual, U.S. ambassador to Mexico, He was vice president and director of Foreign Policy at Brookings from 2006 to 2009, “Use &amp;#34;Smart Power&amp;#34; to Help Cubans,” http://www.brookings.edu/research/opinions/2009/02/24-cuba-huddleston)
Executive authority¶ Again and again we hear that the embargo can&amp;#39;t be changed because 
AND

Conclusion and Recommendations
Undoubtedly, after fifty years of enmity, there is a significant lack of trust 
AND
important to those crafting future policy and making changes in the policymaking milieu.

While Obama maneuvers for a big legislative win on immigration, he’s moving on a

panel, to move through Congress smaller bits of energy and environmental policy.

Tons of offshore drilling now 
Michael Conathan 12, Director of Ocean Policy at the Center for American Progress, spent five years staffing the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation’s Subcommittee on Oceans, Atmosphere, Fisheries, and Coast Guard, master’s degree in marine affairs from the University of Rhode Island, 2/29/12, “More Drilling Won’t Lower Gas Prices,” http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/green/news/2012/02/29/11091/more-drilling-wont-lower-gas-prices/
As fundamental as the law of supply and demand might be to macroeconomic theory, the on-the-ground reality is that more drilling will not lower gas prices. Here’s why:
It hasn’t worked yet. There are currently more oil rigs operating on U.
AND
drilling. All that additional activity hasn’t stemmed the recent gas price spike.
