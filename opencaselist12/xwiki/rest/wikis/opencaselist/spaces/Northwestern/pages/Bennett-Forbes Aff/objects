Second, there are also major long-term global benefits from clean energy cooperation between the U.S. and China.  Costs of clean energy investment would fall throughout the world, making such investment more financially sustainable.  Clean energy is also a crucial part of providing energy access to better meet basic needs, to enhance growth, and to reduce poverty. 
Making clean energy more available and more affordable won~’t be easy. It entails making new and improved low-carbon technologies more cost-competitive on a global scale, and supporting developing countries as they strive to expand energy availability. Here, the capacities in both China and the U.S. for innovation and increased diffusion of clean energy technology come to the fore. 
Achieving the needed cooperation will take work – in organizing scientific exchanges and shared research ventures, as well as in re-examining national investment and trade policies. 
China and U.S. have the means, and I hope the continued will, to take necessary leadership roles in this sphere.  The success of China-U.S. clean energy cooperation could mean a win-win for China, the U.S., and the world.
Such joint efforts could also conserve the planet~’s resources and safeguard future generations from the damaging effects of climate change.

One of the few bright spots in recent international negotiations to replace the expiring 1997

Second, there are also major long-term global benefits from clean energy cooperation between the U.S. and China.  Costs of clean energy investment would fall throughout the world, making such investment more financially sustainable.  Clean energy is also a crucial part of providing energy access to better meet basic needs, to enhance growth, and to reduce poverty. 
Making clean energy more available and more affordable won~’t be easy. It entails making new and improved low-carbon technologies more cost-competitive on a global scale, and supporting developing countries as they strive to expand energy availability. Here, the capacities in both China and the U.S. for innovation and increased diffusion of clean energy technology come to the fore.

Noncompliance is not allowed. Failure to comply with one single ~’shall~’ is sufficient reason to reject the entire product. Indeed, it must be rejected under these circumstances. &#xD;

should&#xD;
~’should~’ is weaker. It describes something that might not be satisfied in the final product, but that is desirable enough that any noncompliance shall be explicitly justified.

Speakers at the event also illustrated the dichotomy of opinion between industry sectors that benefit from low fuel prices and natural gas producers - which have struggled as prices fell amid abundant supply and economic conditions that sapped demand.&#xD;
That price slump has led some producers to call for the government to bolster prices by offering incentives for using natural gas in transportation and other areas.&#xD;
But Ken Bromfield, Dow Chemical~’s North America commercial director, said those policies could be just as detrimental as rules that restrict natural gas production.&#xD;
Manufacturers have announced expansions in the U.S. to capitalize on the nation~’s low-priced natural gas, which fuels plants and is a raw material for some products. &#xD;
&amp;#34;Manufacturing is back, make no mistake about that, and it~’s mostly due to shale gas,&amp;#34; Bromfield said. &amp;#34;Policies that artificially accelerate deman////d ahead of supply, like those that incentivize natural gas vehicles or force the rapid conversion of coal-fired power plants to gas, threaten to hurt this manufacturing renaissance.&amp;#34;&#xD;

BEIJING (AP) — China demanded Thursday that Washington repeal steep tariffs on solar panels that Chinese producers fear will shut their equipment out of the American market.
The tariffs upheld Wednesday by the U.S. Commerce Department add to financial pressure on struggling Chinese solar panel manufacturers that are suffering heavy losses due to weak demand and a price-cutting war.
&amp;#34;The United States is inciting trade friction in new energy and sending a negative signal to the whole world about protectionism and obstructing the development of new energy development,&amp;#34; Ministry of Commerce spokesman Shen Danyang said in a statement. It gave no indication whether Beijing might retaliate.
&amp;#34;We hope the U.S. side will correct its erroneous action with early termination of the trade remedy measures,&amp;#34; Shen said.
The Commerce Department upheld charges of 18 percent to nearly 250 percent on Chinese solar panel producers to counter what it said was improper subsidies by Beijing to the industry. For some companies, charges are lower than preliminary tariffs announced in May.
A spokesman for one of China~’s biggest panel producers, Yingli Green Energy Holding Co., said tariffs of about 30 percent imposed on that company would make sales to the United States unprofitable. He said gross profit margins in the solar industry are about 10 percent.
&amp;#34;A tax rate of 30 percent is the same as 200 percent. Both of them mean the door is closed for exporting to the United States,&amp;#34; said the spokesman, Wang Shuai. &amp;#34;No one does business to lose money.&amp;#34;

Second, there are also major long-term global benefits from clean energy cooperation between the U.S. and China.  Costs of clean energy investment would fall throughout the world, making such investment more financially sustainable.  Clean energy is also a crucial part of providing energy access to better meet basic needs, to enhance growth, and to reduce poverty. 
Making clean energy more available and more affordable won~’t be easy. It entails making new and improved low-carbon technologies more cost-competitive on a global scale, and supporting developing countries as they strive to expand energy availability. Here, the capacities in both China and the U.S. for innovation and increased diffusion of clean energy technology come to the fore. 
Achieving the needed cooperation will take work – in organizing scientific exchanges and shared research ventures, as well as in re-examining national investment and trade policies. 
China and U.S. have the means, and I hope the continued will, to take necessary leadership roles in this sphere.  The success of China-U.S. clean energy cooperation could mean a win-win for China, the U.S., and the world.
Such joint efforts could also conserve the planet~’s resources and safeguard future generations from the damaging effects of climate change.

Paul **Denlinger 10**, consultant specializing in the China market who is based in Hong Kong, 7/20/10, &amp;#34;Why China Has To Dominate Green Tech,&amp;#34; http://www.forbes.com/sites/china/2010/07/20/why-china-has-to-dominate-green-tech/
On the policy level, the Chinese government has to perform a delicate balancing act
AND
an implicit mandate: it will deliver economic growth to the Chinese people. 
This is why the Chinese government has chosen to invest in developing new green energy technology. 
The country is very fortunate in that most of the discovered deposits of rare earths 
AND
wasteful and highly polluting industries around. Think Chinese coal mining with acid.) 
At the same time, Beijing wants to cut back rare earth exports to the 
AND
next generation of energy products used by the world for the next century. 
That is the plan. It would be like if the oil-producing nations in the 1920s and 1930s said that they didn~’t need Western oil exploration firms and refineries to distribute oil products; they would do all the processing themselves, and the Western countries would just order the finished oil products from them. This is how China obviously plans to keep most of the value-added profits within China~’s borders. 
Before any Western readers snap into &amp;#34;evil Chinese conspiracy to take over the world&amp;#34; mode, it~’s worth pointing out that Chinese rare earth experts and government officials have repeatedly warned Western visitors that this policy change would be introduced. Unfortunately, these warnings have gone largely unheeded and ignored by the Western media and politicians who, it seems, have been largely preoccupied by  multiple financial crises and what to do about the West~’s debt load. 
The debt crisis in the West means that it is very hard for Western green 
AND
few, if any western banks who will finance new green energy technologies. 
This has opened a window of opportunity for the Chinese government to finance, and 
AND
promote and incentivize these new technologies, first in China, then overseas. 
Because of China~’s growing energy demands, we are in a race for survival. 
AND
depend on China~’s success to make the transition to green energy this century. 
For all practical purposes, we~’re all in the same boat.
