CONTENTION 2: OUR ADVOCACY IS GOOD
Academic debate over energy policy in the face of environmental destruction is critical to shape the direction of change and create a public consciousness shift~-~--action now is key
Crist 4 (Eileen, Professor at Virginia Tech in the Department of Science and Technology, “Against the social construction of nature and wilderness”, Environmental Ethics 26;1, p 13-6, http://www.sts.vt.edu/faculty/crist/againstsocialconstruction.pdf)
Yet, constructivist analyses of &amp;#34;nature&amp;#34; favor remaining in the comfort zone of

the world at an hour that is pressingly calling us to change it.



Public advocacy of environmental solutions key to change governmental policy~-~--individual change insufficient

there’s no way around this, and we do need to act now.




Pragmatic environmental policy is necessary

2ac Kritik
Perm: do both

The perm is the best option~-~--combining traditional and unconventional epistemologies allows for more thorough analysis of problems~-~--the alt alone is worse because it refuses to acknowledge its own biases 
Conway 97—philosophy, Penn State (Daniel, Nietzsche and the political, 135-6)

This preference is clearly political in nature, and Haraway makes no pretense of aspiring

they might otherwise have gained. 


Perm: do the alternative



Perm~-~--their K should be used to as an additional lens to improve our advocacy~-~--exclusive theoretical focus fails 
Bryant 12—prof of philosophy at Collin College (Levi, RSI, Discursivity, Critique, and Politics, larvalsubjects.wordpress.com/2012/07/18/rsi-discursivity-critique-and-politics/#more-6277)

Shivani 2—award winning fiction writer, poet, and critic. Studied economics at Harvard (Anis, From Redistribution to Recognition: A Left Critique of Multiculturalism, http://www.counterpunch.org/shivani1019.html)

Nevertheless, isn&amp;#39;t it curious that there really is no retrospective look at identity politics

Pragmatic politics are the only way to solve coal—this should be a top-level takeout to any alternative solvency claims—

Broad-based coalitions are key~-~--any alternative gets coopted by the right 
Clark 95—Professor of Law, Catholic University Law School. (Leroy, A Critique of Professor Derrick A. Bell&amp;#39;s Thesis of the Permanence of Racism and His Strategy of Confrontation, 73 Denv. U.L. Rev. 23)

Bhambra 10—U Warwick—AND—Victoria Margree—School of Humanities, U Brighton (Identity Politics and the Need for a ‘Tomorrow’, http://www.academia.edu/471824/Identity_Politics_and_the_Need_for_a_Tomorrow_)

The idea of a politics underpinned by solidarities based on “sameness” has a

Personal experience focus shuts down deliberation and makes debate useless
Subotnik 98 Professor of Law, Touro College, Jacob D. Fuchsberg Law Center. 7 Cornell J. L. and Pub. Pol&amp;#39;y 681, Lexis
Having traced a major strand in the development of CRT, we turn now to

Narrative focus shuts down debate and is equally coercive as framework~-~--it constrains discourse by either forcing sympathetic responses or painting the aff into the corner of attacking them personally 
Coughlin 95—associate Professor of Law, Vanderbilt Law School. (Anne, REGULATING THE SELF: AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL PERFORMANCES IN OUTSIDER SCHOLARSHIP, 81 Va. L. Rev. 1229)

The imbroglio with her editors, however, reveals the inauthenticity of Williams&amp;#39;s invitation to

The warning this episode conveys to readers signals more than a textual incoherence or the

of readers than the legal rhetoric that the outsiders desire to supersede. n195



Anti-coal movements are coming now thanks to a decline in identity politics ~-~-- their strategy crushes those movements ~-~-- causes extinction 
George Monbiot, English Writer and Environmental and Political Activist, 9-4-2008, “Identity Politics in Climate Change Hell,” http://www.celsias.com/article/identity-politics-climate-change-hell/
If you want a glimpse of how the movement against climate change could crumble faster

Purely aesthetic politics lay the groundwork for fascism by relying on propoganda~-~--focus on consequences and institutions is key to prevent style devoid of content that celebrates violence

Restoration of aboriginal title is a precondition for true Sovereignty – conferring title back to natives and recognition of native property rights elevates their power within the legal-economic system which creates the foundation required for the preservation of native culture via a strong system of property rights – more important than withholding title for ecological protection or other paternalistic motives

Decentralized electric generation is generally installed on existing structures or already disturbed or fragmented land, and does not require building new transmission lines. Sensitive desert and mountain habitats and important ecosystems are protected.
Decentralized generation therefore has almost none of the detrimental environmental impacts associated with large-scale renewable sources located hundreds of miles away in the desert or in other remote regions. These impacts could include scraping hundreds of thousands of acres of open or undisturbed land clean of vegetation and consuming significant amounts of precious and limited water resources.54

President Obama’s second State of the Union address set forward a bipartisan framework aimed at unleashing a clean energy revolution in America. Touching on everything from solar and wind power (hooray!), to nuclear power, to “clean” coal (sigh), the president seemed to leave no stone unturned in his quest for actionable solutions.
But unfortunately, he did omit one major point of potential bipartisan cooperation — one that could greatly accelerate our nation’s transition to a clean energy economy. The Department of Energy estimates that wind power from tribal lands could satisfy 14 percent of total U.S. electricity demand PDF, and the tribal solar resources could generate 4.5 times the total amount of energy needed to power the entire country.
Remarkably, however, as of today only one commercial-scale renewable energy project 
AND
could also help keep families together by providing good jobs on the reservations.
Unfortunately, many of these sorely-needed investments never come to fruition. A long-standing backlog of catch-22 requirements, crazy-making rules, and outdated laws cause projects to stall in Indian country. Policy barriers slow development and make financing cost-ineffective.
Obama and the GOP should join forces to remove the bureaucratic barriers to rapid renewable

opportunities; reduce federal bureaucracy and; move America closer to energy independence.

The United States Federal Government should make entities that enact early disposition of solar energy property eligible for the solar energy investment tax credit.&#xD;
Solvency&#xD;
Recapture rules on the investment tax credit prevent solar financing~-~--2 reasons&#xD;
1. Investor shortage~-~--to use the ITC, solar developers need to find a tax equity investor, but the recession wiped out their traditional partners&#xD;

The Impact of the 2008 Financial Crisis¶ A developer will often seek to monetize &#xD;

Recapture rules scare off the new investors solar needs~-~--reforming them solves&#xD;

Modernization would also reduce a significant barrier for non-traditional investors who would be &#xD;
AND&#xD;
and make them more comfortable with transactions incorporating debt at the project level.&#xD;
There’s tax equity shortage now~-~--biggest hurdle to solar production~-~--increasing investment is key&#xD;

The US solar industry is supported by a 30% investment tax credit that generally &#xD;
AND&#xD;
achieve, we must continue to build and diversify the pool of investors.&amp;#34;&#xD;
2. Negotiations~-~--recapture risk leads to clashes between tax equity investors and lenders, causing higher costs and project failure&#xD;

Revising Section 50 and Barriers to Recapture Modernization¶ Just as Congress focused on the &#xD;
AND&#xD;
person and that the property continues to qualify as specified energy property.” 263&#xD;
Effective federal ITC is key to stability and uniformity~-~--the alternative is uncertainty, boom-bust cycles and industry failure&#xD;

The reason that the ITC has been important is that it is the only long&#xD;
AND&#xD;
in the interest of the country to forge this policy sooner than later.&#xD;
Only the plan makes solar cost-competitive~-~--incentivizes learning by doing that brings down costs exponentially&#xD;

===2AC Yes War===


====Russia economy low now—-multiple alt causes====
**Businessweek 13 – **Scott Rose AND*** Olga Tanas, January 31st, 2013, &amp;#34;Russian Economy Probably Slowed to Three-Year Low in 2012&amp;#34; www.businessweek.com/news/2013-01-30/russian-economy-probably-slowed-to-three-year-low-in-2012-http://www.businessweek.com/news/2013-01-30/russian-economy-probably-slowed-to-three-year-low-in-2012
Russia~’s economy probably grew last year at the weakest pace since a contraction in 2009 
AND
in more than three years in December, which may sap buying power.

====Collapse of Russia oil/gas production inevitable—-decreased Europe use and US shale revolution====
**Rapoza 10-3 – **Kenneth Rapoza, writer for Forbes, October 3rd, 2012, &amp;#34;Is Russia Ready For Life After Oil?&amp;#34; www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2012/10/03/is-russia-ready-for-life-after-oil/
Earlier this year, as in April 2012, major oil producers had their worst 
AND
the government takes in its fiscal policy and the investment climate in general.


====No economy impact====

Thus, while Russia~’s financial sector may be getting torn apart, the state does 
AND
has many tools more potent than finance with which to continue reasserting itself.


====US sanctions mean no companies have tech—wrecks solvency====
**Benjamin-Alvadaro 10** (Jonathan, Report for the Cuban Research Institute, Florida International University, PhD, Professor of Political Science at University of Nebraska at Omaha, Director of the Intelligence Community Centers of Academic Excellence Program at UNO, Treasurer of the American Political Science Association, &amp;#34;Cuba~’s Energy Future: Strategic Approaches to Cooperation&amp;#34;)
As long as the economic and trade restrictions imposed on the government of Cuba by

is closed to Cuba by the trade and commercial restrictions currently in place. 
&amp;#34;The good news is we found oil; the bad news is we found

The pursuit of deepwater offshore deposits may not unfold as rapidly as the news releases 
AND
of these suppliers adds up to 30 percent to a project~’s cost.17


====Russia exploration fails====

In 2008 Brazil~’s Petrobras was awarded an exploration and production concession for block 37, 
AND
second-largest oil exporter, and the third-largest energy consumer.

Washington~’s nuclear-reduction proposal is clearly a huge gift to Russia on silver platter
AND
Russia to reduce its nonstrategic nuclear weapons will be an even harder sell.
Thus, Moscow~’s approach is remarkably similar to that of Pyongyang. North Korean leader 
AND
the world, yet by and large this trick has worked for Pyongyang.
Up until now, the same approach has never worked for Russia because nobody believed that Putin is as reckless as the North Korean leadership. But over the past year, the Duma has adopted irrational, provocative anti-U.S. laws under Putin~’s sponsorship. This raises two serious questions: Is Putin trying to emulate Kim Jong-un and his father, Kim Jong-il, and how far is Putin willing to take his reckless policy?

Of current extinction risks, the most severe may be bioterrorism. The knowledge needed 
AND
to respond to pandemics (Lam, Franco, %26 Shuler, 2006).


====Empirics and best studies prove====
**Wohlforth 8** William, Daniel Webster Professor of Government in the Dartmouth College Department of Government, October, World Politics, &amp;#34;Unipolarity, Status Competition, and Great Power War,&amp;#34; www.­polisci.­wisc.­edu/­Uploads/­Documents/­IRC/­Wohlforth (2009)­.­pdf) 
Despite increasingly compelling findings concerning the importance of status seeking in human behavior, research 
AND
are also consistent with power transition and other rationalist theories of hegemonic war.


====Heg sustainable—-alliances, military gap and institutions====

The second assumption is that U.S. hegemony is highly consolidated. In

In terms of economic capabilities, the U.S. combines size with a

makes it the most influential member of the World Trade Organization (WTO). 
These dominant capabilities translate into influence. Most obviously, they provide the U.

In past bipolar and multipolar eras, U.S. structural power was constrained

Traditional theories assume that hegemons inevitably get bogged down and suffer from strategic overextension.

This is not to say that the U.S. can completely shirk its

Thursday~’s decision, from a Supreme Court dominated by Republican appointees, gives Democrats further cover against GOP sniping. &amp;#34;This is something that the court has decided, and very often the court gives political cover to Congress,&amp;#34; said Ross K.

Colo. L. Rev. 561, Lexis
These two leading Colorado Supreme Court decisions, Bowen/Edwards and Voss, were 
AND
a number of unanswered questions that will likely lead to future legal battles.

====Perm do the CP – plan says USFG and not enforcing a restriction removes it even if it remains on the books====
**Berger 1** - Justice for the Supreme Court of Delaware - Opinion, INDUSTRIAL RENTALS, INC., ISAAC BUDOVITCH and FLORENCE BUDOVITCH, Appellants Below, Appellants, v. NEW CASTLE COUNTY BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT and NEW CASTLE COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF LAND USE, Appellees Below, Appellees. No. 233, 2000SUPREME COURT OF DELAWARE776 A.2d 528; 2001 Del. LEXIS 300April 10, 2001, Submitted July 17, 2001, Decided lexis 
We disagree. HN2  Statutes must be read as a whole and all the words 
AND
projects should not have been included in the scope of the Budovitches~’ TIS.

====Courts link to politics====
Mr. **Mirengoff 10** is an attorney in Washington, D.C. A.B., Dartmouth College J.D., Stanford Law School, June 23 The Federalist Society Online Debate Series, http://www.fed-soc.org/debates/dbtid.41/default.asp 
The other thing I found interesting was the degree to which Democrats used the hearings 
AND
president at that time, he likely will receive some of the blame.

====Cuba is key to Obama~’s cred on engagement with non-democratic regimes====
**Dickerson** **10 – **Lieutenant Colonel Sergio M. Dickerson, 2010, &amp;#34;United States Security Strategy Towards Cuba,&amp;#34; Strategy Research Project, www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2%26doc=GetTRDoc.pdf%26AD=ADA518053-http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2%26doc=GetTRDoc.pdf%26AD=ADA518053
Conclusion¶ Today, 20 years have passed since the fall of the Berlin Wall 
AND
decline in the greater global order bringing true peace for years to come.


====Solves war====
Charles **Kupchan 11**, professor of international affairs at Georgetown University and Whitney Shepardson Senior Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, June 2011, &amp;#34;The false promise of unipolarity: constraints on the exercise of American power,&amp;#34; Cambridge Review of International Affairs, Vol. 24, No. 2, p. 165-173
These examples aside, Brooks and Wohlforth also fail to address another important pathway through 
AND
and toleration of political diversity rather than the normative hegemony of the West.

====Perception that the U.S. is losing out determines debates ====
Curry L. **Hagerty 11**, Specialist in Energy and Natural Resources Policy, Congressional Research Service, 5/6/11, &amp;#34;Outer Continental Shelf Moratoria on Oil and Gas Development,&amp;#34; http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R41132.pdf
Global economic factors play a major role in deliberations about OCS drilling activity. At 
AND
part of how moratoria are considered as a tool for OCS policy development. 



====The Secretary of the Treasury does the plan====
**Huddleston 9** (Vicki Huddleston, deputy assistant secretary of defense for Africa at the Department of Defense, visiting fellow at Brookings and co-director of the Brookings Project on U.S. Policy Toward a Cuba in Transition from 2007 to 2009, Carlos Pascual, U.S. ambassador to Mexico, He was vice president and director of Foreign Policy at Brookings from 2006 to 2009, &amp;#34;Use &amp;#34;Smart Power&amp;#34; to Help Cubans,&amp;#34; http://www.brookings.edu/research/opinions/2009/02/24-cuba-huddleston)
Executive authority¶ Again and again we hear that the embargo can~’t be changed because 
AND
to live up to international norms of human rights, democracy and transparency.

====Obama PC fails now—-action on OCS drilling~’s a key olive branch that generates GOP support for other priorities like immigration ====
**CSM 1-20** – Christian Science Monitor, 1/20/13, &amp;#34;Obama~’s second term: Can he work with Congress? (+video),&amp;#34; http://www.csmonitor.com/layout/set/print/USA/DC-Decoder/2013/0120/Obama-s-second-term-Can-he-work-with-Congress-video
&amp;#34;The president has been criticized by many people for his inability or unwillingness to 
AND
have plenty of GOP support – but that remains a large &amp;#34;if.&amp;#34;
