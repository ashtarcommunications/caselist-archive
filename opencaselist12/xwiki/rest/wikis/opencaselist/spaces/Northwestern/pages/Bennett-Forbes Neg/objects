====Obama will win now but it could flip—-prefer electoral college projections over general national polls ====&#xD;
**AC 10-6** – Augusta Chronicle, 10/6/12, &amp;#34;Obama Wins,&amp;#34; http://chronicle.augusta.com/opinion/editorials/2012-10-06/obama-wins?v=1349566351&#xD;
Much can change in the next month, particularly as close as the polling is in this race. And the debate Wednesday night seems to have done just that.&#xD;
But up until the debate, most analyses pointed to an Obama victory in November.&#xD;
National polls are nearly meaningless. What~’s important is how the candidates stand in each state, particularly the swing states of Florida, Virginia, Ohio and several others. Voters elect our president state-by-state through the Electoral College. It takes 270 electoral votes to win.&#xD;
As of last week, Moody~’s Analytics had Obama winning 303.&#xD;
Based on pre-debate polls in seven swing states from RealClearPolitics.com, political website Politico.com had Obama winning 332 electoral votes.&#xD;
Counting the sure votes and those in the &amp;#34;leaning&amp;#34; category, The New York Times has Obama at 237 votes – needing only 33 more from any combination of nine toss-up states containing a total of 110 electoral votes.&#xD;
Examiner.com argues that Obama starts with a base of 251 &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34; electoral votes, if you include Pennsylvania, which isn~’t certain but seems likely. Romney starts with a base of 181 red-state votes.&#xD;

====Energy production refers to the extraction, conversion, and distribution of energy – excludes R%26D====
**Koplow 4** Doug Koplow is the founder of Earth Track in Cambridge, MA. He has worked on natural resource subsidy issues for 20 years, primarily in the energy sector &amp;#34;Subsidies to Energy Industries&amp;#34; Encyclopedia of Energy Vol 5 2004www.earthtrack.net/files/Energy%20Encyclopedia,%20wv.pdf
3. SUBSIDIES THROUGH THE FUEL CYCLE
Because no two fuel cycles are exactly the same, examining subsidies through the context of a generic fuel cycle is instructive in providing an overall framework from which to understand how common subsidization policies work. Subsidies are grouped into preproduction (e.g., R%26D, resource location), production (e.g., extraction, conversion/generation, distribution, accident risks), consumption, postproduction (e.g., decommissioning, reclamation), and externalities (e.g., energy security, environmental, health and safety).
3.1 Preproduction
Preproduction activities include research into new technologies, improving existing technologies, and market assessments to identify the location and quality of energy resources.
3.1.1 Research and Development
R%26D subsidies to energy are common worldwide, generally through government-funded 
AND
%26D of 50% versus private returns of only 20 to 30%.
However, the general concept masks several potential concerns regarding energy R%26D. First, ideas near commercialization have much lower spillover than does basic research, making subsidies harder to justify. Second, politics is often an important factor in R%26D choices, especially regarding how the research plans are structured and the support for follow-on funding for existing projects.
Allocation bias is also a concern. Historical data on energy R%26D (
AND
one-twentieth, albeit during the more limited 1995-1998 period.
3.1.2 Resource Location
Governments frequently conduct surveys to identify the location and composition of energy resources. Although 
AND
, the costs of siting studies should be recovered from the beneficiary industries.
3.2 Production
Energy production includes all stages from the point of resource location through distribution to the final consumers. Specific items examined here include resource extraction, resource conversion (including electricity), the various distribution links to bring the energy resource to the point of final use, and accident risks.
3.2.1 Extraction of Energy Resources
General procedures for leasing access to energy minerals on public lands and more general subsidies for promoting energy extraction both are important areas to evaluate. Extraction-related subsidies are most common for oil and gas production, although they also support nuclear fission (due to uranium mining), geothermal, and coal.
3.2.1.1 Accessing Publicly Owned Energy Resources Terms of access 
AND
response to litigation in the United States over oil and gas royalty underpayments.
3.2.1.2 Promoting Extraction Activities Policies to reduce the cost 
AND
between %240.5 billion and %241.1 billion annually.
However, many subsidies to extraction are not restricted to particular market niches. Percentage 
AND
quarter to one-half the prevailing nominal rates between 1977 and 1995.
3.2.2 Conversion	
Raw energy materials normally go through some conversion prior to consumption. Crude oil is 
AND
phases of the fuel cycle, it is addressed in a separate section.
3.2.2.1 Capital Subsidies Subsidies to capital formation, usually 
AND
greatest detriment to energy resources that conserve capital (most prominently energy conservation).
3.2.2.2	Tax Credits/Purchase Mandates A second 
AND
still being met, the supply is not necessarily renewable or particularly clean.
3.2.3 Transportation and Distribution
Fuel cycles may involve multiple transportation steps, including movement of raw fuels to point of refining, refined fuels to the point of consumption, and movement of wastes to disposal sites. Relevant modes of transport include road, rail, water, pipelines, and transmission lines.
Although specific energy resources vary widely in their transport intensity and in the modes of 
AND
understates the direct costs of the infrastructure and the rights to use it.
Cross-subsidies between user groups may further distort relative prices. Large trucks pay 
AND
retail level. This can dampen retail investments in demand-side management.
Power sources such as wind and solar require no shipment of input fuels or waste
AND
generating these subsidies have continued during the ensuing quarter-century or so.
3.2.4 Accident Risks
A handful of energy activities have the potential to cause catastrophic harm, including large oil spills, dam failures, and nuclear accidents. Many governments cap, shift, or ignore the potential liabilities from these activities. Functioning insurance markets and litigation would normally help to drive up prices for the more dangerous energy sources or particularly negligent operators. Government policies that mask these signals impede substitution to safer alternatives.
3.2.4.1	Large Oil Spills Within the United States
AND
liability shortfalls persist. The subsidy value of these caps is not known.
3.2.4.2	Dam Failures Many activities that would pose 
AND
not in place or is too low, subsidies to hydroelectricity would result.
3.2.4.3	Nuclear Accidents Nuclear accidents can expose large 
AND
%2436 million. In Ukraine, it is roughly %2470 million.
International efforts to standardize liability under the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage would establish minimum liability coverage worldwide, although for many countries this would also constitute the maximum. Under the convention, operators would directly face a first tier of liability. A country fund would provide secondary coverage. Because country payments rely on a sovereign guaranty rather than a prefunded instrument such as a trust fund, they may be at some risk.
Aggregate coverage under the U.S. system is estimated at roughly %249
AND
the Price-Anderson cap even before adjusting retroactive premiums to present values.
Subsidies arise when government caps fall below expected damages from an incident and caps under 
AND
and weaker inspection regimes, they likely have higher liability subsidies as well.
3.3. CONSUMPTION
Government support for energy consumption falls into three main categories: poverty alleviation, economy-wide below-market pricing, and targeted subsidies for certain classes of consumers.
3.3.1	Poverty Alleviation
Subsidies to heat and power for poorer citizens are common, frequently in the form 
AND
subsistence agriculture) or live outside the reach of the subsidized electrical grid.
3.3.2	General Subsidies
Nations with large domestic energy industries sometimes institute policies that keep local prices well below 
AND
production base that is increasingly noncompetitive with that deployed elsewhere in the world.
3.3.3	Targeted Exemptions
Most OECD countries exempt coal and heavy fuel oils used in industry, as well 
AND
,~’~’ generating weaker incentives to adopt even low-cost abatement options.
3.4 Postproduction Activities
Energy production and conversion require large facilities, often located in remote or pristine environments
AND
public subsidy likely given that revenues often drop to zero on plant closure.
3.4.1 Decommissioning
Decommissioning subsidies arise when infrastructure removal costs are ignored or underestimated or when accrued funds 
AND
g., nuclear plants and some mines) can drive costs up further.
Pipelines and hydroelectric dams provide examples of costs being ignored entirely. Koplow and Martin 
AND
, they will have plenty of money available for such an eventuality.~’~’
Underestimating decommissioning requirements is of great concern with nuclear plants. IEA data indicate that 
AND
of which approximately 75% represented insufficient bonding at wells still in operation.
Public bailouts can also be required if accrued funds for postclosure activities are lost through 
AND
and are subject to conservative investment requirements to reduce the likelihood of loss.
3.4.2 Reclamation and Remediation 
Small subsidies to site reclamation and remediation may arise through government-sponsored research into 
AND
500 million per year, much of which is paid by general taxpayers.
3.5 Energy Externalities
External costs of energy production and consumption can include pollution, land degradation, health 
AND
second group is often difficult to quantify and is segregated as an externality.
3.5.1 Energy Security Energy plays a central role in industrialized economies
AND
replace, and dangerous materials that can elevate the severity of any breach.
Energy security strategies include protection of energy-related assets and supply routes, stockpiling 
AND
protecting energy installations and stockpiling are explored in detail in the following subsections.
3.5.1.1 Protection of Assets and Supply Links   
The larger the energy installation, the greater the target and the bigger the dislocation 
AND
assets are likely large, data to quantify the subsidies are generally unavailable.
The costs of defending oil shipments through the Persian Gulf is an exception. As 
AND
the common costs of the vessels and personnel are what are most expensive.
They argued instead for treating the military presence through the lens of joint costs and 
AND
via an excise fee on shipments would help to encourage increased supply diversification.
3.5.1.2 Stockpiling Petroleum has been the main focus of 
AND
stockpiling (two-thirds of IEA-mandated stocks are held commercially).
Buffer stocks for oil within the United States are held within the publicly owned Strategic 
AND
. These include Japan, France, Germany, Korea, and Taiwan.
Subsidies to stockpiles slow transition to less vulnerable, more diversified supplies. Formal tracking of stockpile finance by the IEA, as well as the formalization of accounting rules for calculating costs, would leverage market forces for improved supply security.
3.5.2 Environmental, Health, and Safety Externalities
Externalities involve damages associated with energy production or use that are imposed on surrounding populations 
AND
especially when the costs of maintaining those workers falls on the general taxpayers.
Governments are routinely involved with efforts to make certain energy-related activities safer for

====Science diplomacy doesn~’t create effective cooperation on geopolitical issues====&#xD;
Dickson 9 - David Dickson, Founding Director of the Science-Development Network, June 4, 2009, &amp;#34;The limits of science diplomacy,&amp;#34; online: http://www.scidev.net/en/editorials/the-limits-of-science-diplomacy.html&#xD;
Using science for diplomatic purposes has obvious attractions and several benefits. But there are limits to what it can achieve.&#xD;
The scientific community has a deserved reputation for its international perspective — scientists often ignore national boundaries and interests when it comes to exchanging ideas or collaborating on global problems.&#xD;
So it is not surprising that science attracts the interest of politicians keen to open channels of communication with other states. Signing agreements on scientific and technological cooperation is often the first step for countries wanting to forge closer working relationships.&#xD;
More significantly, scientists have formed key links behind-the-scenes when more overt dialogue has been impossible. At the height of the Cold War, for example, scientific organisations provided a conduit for discussing nuclear weapons control.&#xD;
Only so much science can do&#xD;
Recently, the Obama administration has given this field a new push, in its desire to pursue &amp;#34;soft diplomacy&amp;#34; in regions such as the Middle East. Scientific agreements have been at the forefront of the administration~’s activities in countries such as Iraq and Pakistan.&#xD;
But — as emerged from a meeting entitled New Frontiers in Science Diplomacy, held in London this week (1–2 June) — using science for diplomatic purposes is not as straightforward as it seems.&#xD;
Some scientific collaboration clearly demonstrates what countries can achieve by working together. For example, a new synchrotron under construction in Jordan is rapidly becoming a symbol of the potential for teamwork in the Middle East.&#xD;
But whether scientific cooperation can become a precursor for political collaboration is less evident. For example, despite hopes that the Middle East synchrotron would help bring peace to the region, several countries have been reluctant to support it until the Palestine problem is resolved. &#xD;
Indeed, one speaker at the London meeting (organised by the UK~’s Royal Society and the American Association for the Advancement of Science) even suggested that the changes scientific innovations bring inevitably lead to turbulence and upheaval. In such a context, viewing science as a driver for peace may be wishful thinking.&#xD;

&#xD;
As a misguided Turkish proverb holds, &amp;#34;If your enemy be an ant, imagine him to be an elephant.&amp;#34; The new information unearthed in Osama bin Laden~’s hideout in Abbottabad, Pakistan, suggests that the United States has been doing so for a full decade. Whatever al Qaeda~’s threatening rhetoric and occasional nuclear fantasies, its potential as a menace, particularly as an atomic one, has been much inflated.&#xD;
The public has now endured a decade of dire warnings about the imminence of a &#xD;

The full story is not out yet, but it seems breathtakingly unlikely that the &#xD;

The documents also reveal that after fleeing Afghanistan, bin Laden maintained what one member &#xD;
AND&#xD;
and that &amp;#34;the next wave of attacks may come at any moment.&amp;#34;&#xD;
The obsessive desire notwithstanding, such fulminations have clearly lacked substance. Although hundreds of millions of people enter the United States legally every year, and countless others illegally, no true al Qaeda cell has been found in the country since 9/11 and exceedingly few people have been uncovered who even have any sort of &amp;#34;link&amp;#34; to the organization.&#xD;
The closest effort at an al Qaeda operation within the country was a decidedly nonnuclear &#xD;
AND&#xD;
United States, to the civilized world, to the modern state system.&#xD;
Indeed, no Muslim extremist has succeeded in detonating even a simple bomb in the United States in the last ten years, and except for the attacks on the London Underground in 2005, neither has any in the United Kingdom. It seems wildly unlikely that al Qaeda is remotely ready to go nuclear.&#xD;
Outside of war zones, the amount of killing carried out by al Qaeda and &#xD;

The current period is comparable to the late 1940s and early 1950s, when decisions regarding fission-triggered thermonuclear weapons were being made. Once the feasibility of such weapons was established by a 1952 US test, which was not of a deliverable weapon, the pressure to develop huge arsenals of thermonuclear weapons in the United States and the Soviet Union became inexorable. &#xD;

====Science doesn~’t over-come political differences – no international co-op====&#xD;
Badger 9 - Emily Badger, journalist for Miller-McCune, February 9, 2009, &amp;#34;Science Diplomacy: Trading Frock Coats for Lab Coats,&amp;#34; Miller-McCune, online: http://www.miller-mccune.com/politics/science-diplomacy-trading-frock-coats-for-lab-coats-3953/&#xD;
Glenn Schweitzer, director of the National Academies~’ Office for Central Europe and Eurasia, had been coordinating nongovernmental exchanges with Iran for more than a decade. On this latest visit, scientists from both countries identified a laundry list of areas for continued cooperation: cancer trends, biomedical ethics, cell replacement therapy, personalized medicine and highway accidents. &#xD;
Shortly before he was scheduled to leave the country, Schweitzer was detained by three announced &amp;#34;security officials.&amp;#34; English-language newspapers in Iran at the time had been full of reports of American and Israeli counterintelligence activities in the country. The U.S., Iranian officials would later accuse, was trying to foment a &amp;#34;velvet revolution.&amp;#34;&#xD;
Schweitzer was questioned for nine hours across two days about his involvement in such a revolution. He was eventually released, but he said the security officials left him with a message that &amp;#34;science exchanges are not a good thing.&amp;#34;&#xD;
 &amp;#34;This was quite a surprise,&amp;#34; Schweitzer told the audience at the AAAS event, which had been rescheduled around his detainment to January, two days after Barack Obama~’s inauguration. &amp;#34;Just two days earlier, we had had one of the top political leaders of the country who said, ~’Charge on, these are great things to do. We~’d like to have this cooperation. In fact, I want to be involved in the cooperation.~’&#xD;
 &amp;#34;So there~’s a disconnect between the scientific community, the political leadership, and the security services.&amp;#34;&#xD;
Schweitzer was speaking specifically about Iran, but a similar schism may exist anywhere in the world where public opinion of American foreign policy differs so dramatically from opinion of U.S. science and technology.&#xD;
As a result of Schweiter~’s detention, the National Academies have suspended exchanges with Iran until its government can provide safety assurances to visiting scholars and scientists.&#xD;
The incident was equally surprising to Robert Berdahl, president of the Association of American Universities, who visited Iran in November with a delegation of university presidents (all scientists by background). The group had been invited by counterparts in Iran to discuss student and faculty exchanges. Berdahl stressed to his hosts that security was his main concern, and so Schweitzer~’s detention just a few weeks after those conversations has now stalled that program, too.&#xD;
Iran, with its mix of enthusiasm for American exchanges but security obstacles to hosting them, underscores the challenges &amp;#34;science diplomacy&amp;#34; would face even around noncontroversial areas of research cooperation such as water irrigation.</headline></objectSummary></objects>
