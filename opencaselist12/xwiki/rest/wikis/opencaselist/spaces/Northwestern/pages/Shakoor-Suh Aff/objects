Contention 1 is trade 
Recent US anti-dumping tariffs on Chinese Solar cell imports threaten to start an energy trade war 
Rex-Kiss 8/17-12, Endre, green technology advocate and freelance copywriter in topics of sustainability and social media, “Are solar panels about to start a new trade war between China and the West?”, http://www.earthtimes.org/green-blogs/green-living/solar-panel-trade-war-china-west-17-Aug-12/
Tensions are always running high between Chinese and western manufacturers, but it seems those 
AND
turns volatile it will be bad for the environment as well as business.

Solar barriers spillover internationally and across industries—destroys the economy and causes a new escalating trade war
Tucker 8/27/12, William, work has appeared in Harper’s, the Atlantic Monthly, the American Spectator, the Weekly Standard, National Review, Reason, the New Republic, Reader’s Digest, the Wall Street Journal, and many other publications, “Let’s Just Admit Solar Needs Help and Avoid Trade War”, http://www.nucleartownhall.com/blog/william-tucker-let%E2%80%99s-just-admit-solar-needs-help-and-avoid-trade-war/
Although the newspapers haven’t been paying much attention lately, the United States and China 
AND
this will make for good old clean-and-green solar power.

The tariff makes Chinese reciprocation and global protectionism inevitable

The U.S. Department of Commerce announced a ruling last week to raise 
AND
solar-industry growth and to solve our planet&amp;#39;s energy and environmental crisis.
An escalated U.S. China trade war results in economic conflicts and devastating protectionism 
Wang and Li 11 (Jianhua and Yunlu—Xinhua news agency, citing Ni Feng, Vice President of the Institute of American Studies underthe Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, Zhao Jinping, vice director of the Foreign Economic Department of the Development Research Center (DRC) of the State Council “China-US trade war no good for anyone”, October 13, 2011. http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90780/7616581.html 
A trade war between the United States and China, each of which is the 
AND
and will even lead to political and military confrontations in some sensitive regions. 


Economic crisis independently causes nuclear war
Green and Schrage 9 [Michael J Green is Senior Advisor and Japan Chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) and Associate Professor at Georgetown University.

Ben holds a bachelor of arts degree from Yale University. April 3, 2007, http://chinaredux.com/2007/04/03/protectionism-and-war/#comments,)
The greatest threat for the 21st century is that these economic flare-ups between

–far more than increases in military budgets and anti-satellite tests.
Nuclear world war 3
Hunkovic 9 – American Military University [Lee J, 2009, “The Chinese-Taiwanese Conflict: Possible Futures of a Confrontation between China, Taiwan and the United States of America”, http://www.lamp-method.org/eCommons/Hunkovic.pdf]
A war between China, Taiwan and the United States has the potential to escalate 
AND
outcome, therefore, other countries will not be considered in this study.
Most recent studies provide a direct connection between poor economic relations and military conflict
Royal 10 – Jedediah Royal, Director of Cooperative Threat Reduction at the U.S. Department of Defense, 2010, “Economic Integration, Economic Signaling and the Problem of Economic Crises,” in Economics of War and Peace: Economic, Legal and Political Perspectives, ed. Goldsmith and Brauer, p. 213-215
Less intuitive is how periods of economic decline may increase the likelihood of external conflict
AND
such, the view presented here should be considered ancillary to those views.

Removing the tariff solves – market forces will correct any “dumping” 
Gallaghers 12, 5-22, Kelly and Kevin, Kelly Sims Gallagher is associate professor of energy and environmental policy at The Fletcher School, Tufts University. Kevin P. Gallagher is associate professor of international relations at Boston University, “Guest post: Blinded by the (solar) light”, http://blogs.ft.com/beyond-brics/2012/05/22/guest-post-blinded-by-the-solar-light/?catid=491andSID=google#axzz1vhhMeBo3 
The Obama Administration’s preliminary decision to impose a 31 per cent tariff on solar panels 
AND
Administration should applaud it and do its part to correct market distortions too.

1AC Solar Industry
Contention 2 is the Solar Industry


Scenario 1 is Blackouts

Solar tariffs will destroy the installation industry which shatters the overall solar market 
Pierobon 12, 2-29, James, former Chief Energy Writer and Political Correspondent at the Houston Chronicle , “the case against a tariff on imported Chinese solar panels”, http://theenergycollective.com/jimpierobon/77861/guest-opinion-jigar-shah-makes-case-against-tariff-imported-chinese-solar-panels

is a terrible idea — for American jobs, prosperity and the environment.”


The tariff halts US solar transition by preventing cost-competitiveness 
Jabusch 5/18/12 [Garvin Jabusch, cofounder and chief investment officer of Green Alpha Advisors and co-manager of the Green Alpha Next Economy Index. Jabusch was previously Director of Forward Sustainable Investments, a business unit of Forward Management, and Vice President, Strategic Services at Morgan Stanley. “Tariffs on Chinese Solar Are Bad for Us All,” http://sierraclub.typepad.com/gaa/2012/05/tariffs-on-chinese-solar-are-bad-for-us-all.html]
The United States Department of Commerce yesterday, and of all things at the behest 
AND
we just ceded the advantage in getting Saudi’s solar business to Chinese firms. 



Heat waves are already threatening prolonged blackouts in US cities – these will only get more frequent and more intense
Stone 8/8/12 [Brian Stone, Assistant Professor in the City and Regional Planning Program at the Georgia Institute of Technology, “Urban Heat Islands and Climate Change: Planning for Extreme Heat in Cities,” http://www.epa.gov/hiri/resources/transcripts/8_aug_2012-webcasttranscript-stone.pdf]
Most critical is your logical infrastructure. In 2003, the same year as the 
AND
prolonged blackout in the major U.S. cities is certainly increasing.



Bioterror attack coming by 2013
Fox News 8 (Fox News, “Nuclear or Bioterror Attack on U.S. Likely by 2013, Panel Warns”, 12-2-08, http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,459927,00.html)
Terrorists are likely to attack the United States using nuclear or biological weapons before 2013
AND
destruction today, all roads would intersect in Pakistan,&amp;#34; the report states. 


An unchecked bioterror attack causes extinction
Steinbruner, 97 — Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution (John, Foreign Policy, 12/22, p. nexis)
More than 70 years later, revulsion persists and the Geneva Protocol has been strengthened
AND
for a global contagion of this sort but not necessarily its outer limit.   


Minimizing death toll key—large casualties ensure retaliation and escalation to nuclear war.
Conley 3 [Lt Col Harry W. is chief of the Systems Analysis Branch, Directorate of Requirements, Headquarters Air Combat Command (ACC), Langley AFB, Virginia. Air and Space Power Journal) http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/apj/apj03/spr03/conley.html]
Continues…The number of American casualties suffered due to a WMD attack may well 
AND
be more than just a possibility, whatever promises had been made.”48



Blackouts undermine bioterror response and disease containment efforts that uniquely minimize mortality rates
Kelly and Osterholm 08 [Nicholas S. Kelley, Research assistant with The Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy(CIDRAP) Business Source and a doctoral student in the Divison of Environmental Health Sciences at the University of Minnesota&amp;#39;s School of Public Health, and Michael T.

Written in their report “Pandemic Influenza, Electricity, and the Coal Supply Chain” http://www.sovrn.com/PDF/pubs_CIDRAP_Coal_Report.pdf]
When one considers public health preparedness, the availability of electricity generally is not considered 
AND
typically operate in the background—unless a breakdown in the infrastructure occurs.


Unchecked disease spread independently causes extinction
Yu 9 — Dartmouth Undergraduate Journal of Science (Victoria, Human Extinction: The Uncertainty of Our Fate, 22 May 2009, http://dujs.dartmouth.edu/spring-2009/human-extinction-the-uncertainty-of-our-fate) 
A pandemic will kill off all humans. In the past, humans have indeed 
AND
could only infect birds — into a human-viable strain (10).


Expanded solar energy makes heat wave blackouts impossible
Perez et al 11 [Richard Perez, Research Professor, Atmospheric Sciences Research Center, SUNY; Ken Zweibel, director of the GW Solar Institute at George Washington University; Thomas Hoff,  Founder of Clean Power Research and President of its Research and Consulting Group; “Solar power generation in the US: Too expensive, or a bargain?” Energy Policy Volume 39, Issue 11, November 2011, Pages 7290–7297]
Solar generators, distributed PV in particular, are not available at will,2 
AND
2010), representing a deployment potential of nearly 375 GW in the US.

Scenario 2 is Price Spikes
Natural gas prices are low but future volatility is inevitable
Real Clear Energy 5/14/12 [Real Clear Energy Editors, “Natural Gas Prices Have Become More Volatile,” http://www.realclearenergy.org/charticles/2012/05/14/the_2000s_were_a_volatile_decade_for_natural_gas_prices.html]
It is easy to forget how volatile natural gas markets have become and that the 
AND
becomes more central to our economy, rapid price changes become more likely.


Price volatility wrecks the fertilizer industry
IECA 3 [Industrial Energy Consumers of America, nonprofit organization created to promote the interests of manufacturing companies for which the availability, use and cost of energy, power or feedstock play a significant role in their ability to compete, July 22 2003, “IMPACT OF THE U.S. NATURAL GAS CRISIS ON THE NORTH AMERICAN NITROGEN FERTILIZER INDUSTRY,” http://www.ieca-us.com/wp-content/uploads/072203Fertilizerbriefing.pdf]
High natural gas prices present the most serious threat to the fertilizer sector and to 
AND
must enact policies that stabilize the supply/demand balance for natural gas.


Food supply is on the brink now—the fertilizer industry is key to prevent a crisis
FI 9 [Fertilizer Institute, Trade Group representing the fertilizer industry, “The U.S. Fertilizer Industry and Climate Change Policy,” April 2 2009, http://www.kochfertilizer.com/pdf/TFI2009ClimateChange.pdf]
Fertilizer nutrients – nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium – are all naturally occurring elements that 
AND
disaster or substandard world harvest away from a full-scale food crisis.


Escalating food instability causes extinction—US production is key

In a world confronted by global terrorism, turmoil in the Middle East, burgeoning 
AND
in the survival of billions of people and the health of our planet. 


Affordable solar power acts as a hedge against natural gas price spikes – ensures stability for industry
Powerfin Partners 11 [Powerfin Partners is a manager of institutional funds for solar projects in North America, with meaningful experience in energy capital markets, legal and regulatory matters, and renewable engineering, “Why the Solar Industry Lacks Pricing Power,” December 20, 2011, http://www.powerfinpartners.com/new_site/pdf/Why%20the%20Solar%20Industry%20Lacks%20Pricing%20Power%20122011.pdf]
While myriad uncertainties surround the future of natural gas pricing, what is certain is 
AND
a portion of your budget with a long-lived asset like solar.

Removing the tariff increases access to Chinese PV modules which are key to solar expansion

Cameron, Ph.D. in Economics and Senior Consultant for the Brattle Group; Judy Chang, economist with expertise in the analysis of electricity power markets and principal at the Brattle Group; “The Employment Impacts of Proposed Tariffs on Chinese Manufactured Photovoltaic Cells and Modules,” January 30 2012, http://coalition4affordablesolar.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/TBG_Solar-Trade-Impact-Report.pdf]
Average module prices in the U.S. are largely determined by Chinese imports
AND
expected to have a larger relative impact on the price of utility systems.


1AC Clean Tech
The solar tariff disputes undermines broader US-China clean-energy cooperation
AP 5/19/12 [“Ruling adds to China trade tension: POSSIBLE U.S. TARIFFS ON SOLAR-PANEL IMPORTS MAY THREATEN CLEAN ENERGY COOPERATION,” http://www.stltoday.com/business/local/ruling-adds-to-china-trade-tension/article_c7071e82-78b7-5d95-b943-a8c6e5cc93de.html]

Second, there are also major long-term global benefits from clean energy cooperation 
AND
planet’s resources and safeguard future generations from the damaging effects of climate change.


The market cooperation creates is necessary to continued innovation in green-tech that solves warming

China and the United States, the world’s dominant producers of carbon emissions, have 
AND
all of these technologies, they cannot achieve separately what they could jointly.


Additionally the solar issue spills over to all forms of environment cooperation—it undermines technical advancement and undermines the direction of leadership set up by the Durban platform 
Barbier 12 (Edward B—the John S. Bugas Professor of Economics, University of Wyoming, “Can the US and China Cooperate over Climate and Clean Energy?”, May 28, 2012, http://chinausfocus.com/energy-environment/can-the-us-and-china-cooperate-over-climate-and-clean-energy/)
One of the few bright spots in recent international negotiations to replace the expiring 1997 
AND
undermines the fragile beginnings of US and China cooperation over global climate change.

The Durban Platform provides a new opportunity to solve global climate change—even if it fails to stop warming, it substantially mitigates CO2 emissions

 The decisions are practically in accord in holding that the courts have no power to repeal or abolish a statute, and that notwithstanding a decision holding it unconstitutional a statute continues to remain on the statute books; and that if a statute be declared unconstitutional and the decision so declaring it be subsequently overruled the statute will then be held valid from the date it became effective. n43
Enforcement of the statute followed without congressional action. n44
When this enforcement was challenged, the Municipal Court of Appeals for the District of 
AND
decision is reversed the statute is valid from its first effective date. n46
 The court declared this precedent sound since the cases were &amp;#34;in accord with

rejecting this claim and in finding for the husband, the Court stated:

an assumption of legislative power not delegated to it by the Constitution. n52
 The Louisiana Court thus took a mechanical approach to the revival question. According to its rationale, when a statute is found unconstitutional, it is judicially determined never to have existed. Revival therefore entails judicial legislation and thereby violates constitutionally mandated separation of powers: because the initial legislative passage  ~~[*1915~~]  of the bill has no legitimacy, the bill~’s force is considered to be purely a creature of judicial decision-making.
Jefferson has little analytic appeal. Its view of the separation of powers doctrine is

a statute did not revive does not offer a convincing rationale for nonrevival.

The U.S. energy independence debate is getting very tetchy of late. Seasoned energy experts are trading cheap blows, principally for sitting on opposite sides of the fence. Nobody doubts that U.S. energy output will  keep growing, but whether it ever amounts to full ~’independence~’ is at best tenuous. More importantly, it spells total disaster for America~’s role in the world. No global oil role, forget being a global hyper power. Those days will be gone.   
The allure of energy independence is a compelling story to tell. The U.
AND
everyone pays for a barrel of oil. Epic stuff, no doubt.
Whether you believe all these numbers doesn~’t really matter. Few U.S. 
AND
or more), it~’s already creating serious geopolitical gaps across international energy markets.
That~’s deeply problematic, precisely because supply side dynamics are looking more fragile than they 
AND
a new geopolitical game thanks to energy independence beckoning just around the corner.

The U.S. is moving toward greater energy independence just as China, 
AND
the ingredients for a historic reshuffling of the security picture in the region.
The question facing policymakers in Washington is deceptively simple:  Would that be a good thing or a bad thing?
Many believe that greater Chinese involvement, especially in tasks such as protecting global commerce, will lead the country to support the international order the U.S. created after World War II—and from which China has benefited so much.  Others worry that China~’s rapid naval modernization and desire to play a bigger global role will complicate American foreign policy, and help cloak the country~’s military capabilities as it strives for parity with the U.S.
One thing is certain: China~’s quest for a modern navy coincides with its transformation from an oil exporter to an oil importer, with most of that crude winding its way through narrow chokepoints controlled by the U.S. Navy.  Known as the &amp;#34;Malacca Dilemma,&amp;#34; for the straits through which pass 80% of China~’s crude, that nagging worry has dictated much of China~’s security posture.
&amp;#34;If you look back at rising powers in history, one of the things they do is get very uncomfortable with leaving the security of trade routes to established powers, so they gear up their military capability, which can take on a life of its own,&amp;#34; said Michael Levi, an energy security expert at the Council on Foreign Relations.
The last time China had a true blue-water navy capable of sailing the high seas, showing the flag, and cowing potential rivals was the early 1400s.  Today, the Pentagon has concluded, Beijing wants that capability again.
&amp;#34;China~’s leaders have offered unambiguous guidance that the ~~[People~’s Liberation Army Navy~~] will play a growing role in protecting China~’s far-flung interests,&amp;#34; the Pentagon report concluded. While acknowledging that Chinese naval capabilities are still in their infancy—it just launched its very first aircraft carrier, and carrier air wings are still a future project—the report underscored concerns that the Chinese navy represents the most serious challenge to U.S. interests in the Pacific.
In recent years, China has been assertive about its rights in neighboring seas, 
AND

Revelations that Pakistan has invited China to construct a naval base at the strategically located port of Gwadar have intensified anxieties about Beijing~’s Indian Ocean objectives.
For many observers, any militarisation of the Gwadar facility - a predominantly Chinese-funded commercial port about 500km from the Strait of Hormuz - would confirm deep-seated suspicions about Beijing~’s so-called &amp;#34;string of pearls&amp;#34; strategy.
According to proponents of this view, China is establishing ports throughout littoral South Asia

====The plan collapses oil prices overnight—-the link is huge and unique ====
**Poruban 12** Steven Poruban &amp;#34;API: Raising US oil supplies key to lowering gasoline prices&amp;#34; 3/26 www.ogj.com/articles/print/vol-110/issue-3c/general-interest/api-raising-us-oil.html
A major component to relieving upward pressure on gasoline prices in the US will come from increasing domestic oil production and not from raising taxes, American Petroleum Institute Pres. and Chief Executive Officer Jack Gerard told reporters Mar. 20 during a conference call from Washington, DC.
He said President Barack Obama~’s administration needs a &amp;#34;reality check&amp;#34; as well as a revision to the unclear signals it is sending the market. This is something that US voters understand as well, Gerard noted, citing statistics from a poll conducted earlier this month by Harris Interactive on behalf of API among 1,009 registered voters in the US.
&amp;#34;Voters understand that raising taxes is not a solution for high gasoline prices,&amp;#34; Gerard said, adding, &amp;#34;No economist in the world will tell you gas prices can be reduced by increasing taxes, and the Congressional Research Service just released a study saying so,&amp;#34; Gerard said.
&amp;#34;A true all-of-the-above energy strategy would include greater access to areas that are currently off limits, a regulatory and permitting process that supported reasonable timelines for development, and immediate approval of the Keystone XL pipeline to bring more Canadian oil to US refineries. This would send a positive signal to the market and could help put downward pressure on prices,&amp;#34; he said.
A large majority of these polled voters, API said, &amp;#34;also believe that more US oil and natural gas development could reduce gasoline prices (81%), lead to more American jobs (90%), and enhance America~’s energy security (84%).&amp;#34;
Gerard said, &amp;#34;Most US resources have been placed off-limits. The 
AND
on our treasury in taxes, rents, royalties, and bonus bids.&amp;#34;
Market perception
The very notion that the Obama administration is proposing the release of oil supplies from the nation~’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve or asking other countries, such as Saudi Arabia, to boost oil production, is a &amp;#34;clear admissions that supply matters&amp;#34; in the case of relieving gasoline price pressure, Gerard said.
Markets are largely driven by perception, Gerard said, and when Obama in his early days in office sent out the message to the market that oil and gas production from the Gulf of Mexico, for example, would be higher today than it was then, that is part of the reason we~’re experiencing higher gasoline prices in the US.
To illustrate this point about clear market signals, Gerard recalled the example of when US gasoline prices were surpassing %244/gal during George W. Bush~’s presidency, his administration lifted the moratorium on offshore drilling and in a matter of days, oil prices fell by %2415-16/bbl.


====Prolonged dip in prices collapses all producer states, causes political repression and state collapse, and unleashes wars across the world====
Hulbert 12 Matthew Hulbert is an analyst at the Netherlands Institute for International Relations &amp;#34;The political perils of low oil prices&amp;#34; July 9 2012 www.europeanenergyreview.eu/site/pagina.php?id=3796%26id_mailing=295%26toegang=49182f81e6a13cf5eaa496d51fea6406
As unedifying as all that might be, the bigger problem producer states have is that internal repression has no guarantee of success these days. It didn~’t work for Gadhafi in Libya, and it~’s unlikely to work for Assad in Syria in the long term. As fierce as the rear-guard battles have been, they~’ve not been militarily conclusive or conducive to on-going hydrocarbon production. 
Follow that argument through and it is clear that if the bulk of producer regimes 
AND
major players not sitting on a powder keg of political risk these days. 
More likely than not, it will be some of the smaller players that get 
AND
could end up with a scorched earth policy if financing gaps aren~’t closed. 
Go further up the producer state ~’food chain~’, and some of the world~’s largest players all have the same structural political problems, be it in the Middle East, Eurasia or Latin America. Any sign that a bigger petro-beast is losing control, and prices would rapidly lift. That might be welcome news for producer states lucky enough to ride the price wave and remain intact, but it~’s a very dangerous game to play. 
And that~’s the whole problem here - the gap between geological costs of production and 
AND
where consumers want to be in terms of sourcing plentiful and fungible supplies.
Final scene: corpses all over the stage
By way of reminder, as much as petro-states currently face a systemic 
AND
eminently possible, but swings well beyond that ~’price band~’ all too likely. 
Splitting this price directly in two and sticking close to %24100/b might not be that bad an idea after all: Mopping up the mess from producer state implosion would require an effort far beyond the international systems capabilities and reach. Carefully agreed truces are always better than outright wars, particularly for those squeamish about collateral damage. Corpses would litter the entire energy stage.


====High oil prices key to Russia~’s economy and political stability—-a slump plunges the bear into chaos====

Russia Could Face Political Flux if Oil Prices Sink
Russia~’s political stability risks being being shaken if Greece leaves the Euro area and triggers a sinking in the price of oil, according to a new report from an influential Moscow think tank, released on Thursday.
&amp;#34;There~’s a big chance of a Greek exit, which would lead to more countries pulling out of the currency union,&amp;#34; said Mikhail Dmitriev, head of the Center for Strategic Studies.
Russia relies on oil and gas exports for half of its budget revenue and Europe as a market for more than 50 percent of its exports and 42 percent of imports, according to official data.
&amp;#34;If energy prices plunge, Russia may suffer a worse recession than in 2009, which would swell anti-Putin sentiment and we will see the escalation of political violence and repression on one hand, and the worst economic crisis on the other,&amp;#34; said Dmitriev, a deputy economy minister of Russia from 2000 to 2004. &amp;#34;This may lead to Putin losing control and a chaotic political transformation.&amp;#34;
Brent, the grade that underpins prices for Russia~’s Urals oil blend, may decline to US%2480 a barrel if Greece leaves the currency union without triggering crises in other euro members or as low as US%2460 if there is a &amp;#34;disorderly&amp;#34; breakup of the euro region, according to a Bank of America report dated May 17. Urals today traded at US%24103.95, the lowest since last December.
As for nation~’s gross domestic product, it may shrink to 2.1 percent, when inflation will speed up to 6.7 percent, according to the Sberbank~’s Center of Macroeconomic Research. Bank of America Merrill Lynch predicts even higher inflation which might be as much as 7.6 percent.
&amp;#34;If the oil price will slump to US%2480 per barrel, Russia may experience zero growth in GDP,&amp;#34; Julia Tseplyaeva, leading economist with BNP Paribas said to Russian business daily Vedomosti.
The study is being closely watched because Dmitriev~’s center was the only major one to accurately predict early last year that support for the regime was plunging and that it would face a crisis as early as December~’s parliamentary elections.
&amp;#34;A deteriorating global economy would threaten to wipe out capital that Russian investors and businesses moved to Europe in search of safety,&amp;#34; Dmitriev said, adding that there is already &amp;#34;large-scale capital flight from Russia, despite the economic recovery.&amp;#34;
In a worst-case scenario following a Greek exit from the euro area, Russia~’s economy would contract 2.1 percent with the potential for US%2495 billion in capital leaving the country in a year, Ksenia Yudaeva, chief economist at Moscow-based OAO Sberbank, the country~’s biggest lender, said to Bloomberg.

====Oil prices are the lifeblood of Saudi growth and stability—-full coffers key to deterring an arab spring====

With OPEC nations pumping the highest levels of oil since 2008, the price of crude has dropped to below %2480. This sort of news means that Saudi Arabia, the nation with the largest oil reserves in the world, will have to start running a deficit and could cut back on promised expenditures originally aimed at keeping any popular unrest at bay.
Saudi Arabia has worked hard to diversify its economy, but oil remains its lifeblood, paying for massive infrastructure projects, covering bloated civil service payrolls and ensuring free or low-cost healthcare and other benefits.
Saudi Arabia~’s break-even price is around %2470-%2480, according to bankers and analysts surveyed by the Reuters news agency. When oil was high, above %24115 a barrel last year, and Saudi Arabia~’s coffers swelled, it allocated a series of subsidies and other measures worth as much as %24133 billion to help ensure the bounty reached ordinary Saudis.
That appears to be in jeopardy.
&amp;#34;Those at the top of the Saudi royal pyramid are old, and the aging of the leadership could have geopolitical implications,&amp;#34; Yoel Guzansky, a senior researcher and expert on Saudi Arabia at the Institute for National Security Studies, told The Media Line.
&amp;#34;The Arab Spring challenges the legitimacy of the monarchs themselves. Iran does the same, but they use Iran as a scapegoat for many things and it has actually helped them. But the Arab Spring is a real threat,&amp;#34; Guzansky said. &amp;#34;They lose enemies — look at Syria — but also allies. I don~’t know what will happen next in Jordan. I don~’t know what the future holds for Bahrain.&amp;#34;

Economically, should Bahrain experience further unrest, Saudi Arabia could become engulfed in similar 
AND
managers. An economy broadly based on foreign expertise would be severely disrupted.
On a political level, the repression of such an uprising would undoubtedly be brutal. This would force the U.S. to critique and distance itself from its long-term ally, isolating Saudi further and making it internally compromise with the religious establishment and curtail [[promised reforms-http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/sep/25/saudi-arabia-women-vote-elections]] to stabilize the state. It would also lead to a stricter Wahabbi doctrine being enforced, especially in the relatively relaxed Eastern Province, as the Kingdom attempted to reassert control.
