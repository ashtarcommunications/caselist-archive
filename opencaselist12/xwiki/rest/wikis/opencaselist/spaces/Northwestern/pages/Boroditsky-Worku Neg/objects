President Obama and Republicans are engaging in dangerous brinksmanship.

====Unlimited exports tank the manufacturing industry—key to competitiveness====&#xD;
**Blitz 12** (George, Vice President of Energy and Climate Change at Dow Chemical Company, &amp;#34;Manufacturing Key to Natural Gas Value&amp;#34;, 4/19, http://energy.nationaljournal.com/2012/04/what-should-us-policy-be-on-en.php~~%232198672)&#xD;
While the nation struggles to find solutions to the current economic crisis, there has been a sharp focus on the country~’s newly abundant supply of natural gas as a potential cure—-and rightly so. However, those that advocate unlimited natural gas exports are taking a short-sighted approach, missing the tremendous opportunity to leverage domestic natural gas to spur a manufacturing Renaissance in the U.S.&#xD;
Already the prospect of advantaged and abundant U.S. gas has sparked domestic &#xD;
AND&#xD;
strengthens the economy well beyond what gas production and export alone can achieve.&#xD;
Take the U.S. chemical industry for example. The American Chemistry Council estimates that a 25 percent increase in the production of shale gas and ethane (a shale gas derivative) would create more than 400,000 new jobs along the entire value chain, %2416 million in investment, more than %24130 billion in economic output and %244.4 billion in new tax revenues. &#xD;
However, supply and demand must be balanced in a way that allows gas producers to maintain supply at stable, globally competitive prices that spur manufacturing growth and deliver reasonable costs for all consumers. Manufacturers may be the most price-sensitive users of natural gas and a rush to artificially create demand or constrain supplies would destroy the competitive advantage abundant, affordable domestic natural gas is creating for the U.S.&#xD;
Policies that artificially accelerate demand, especially in-elastic demand, upset the natural supply-and-demand balance necessary to keep natural gas prices affordable for U.S. manufacturers. This includes unlimited exportation of natural gas.&#xD;
Fair and free trade must be supported in a nationally prudent manner. A sound energy policy that promotes U.S. economic growth is needed for us to realize the tremendous opportunity domestic natural gas presents.&#xD;
Alternatively, exporting amounts of natural gas that drive prices closer to the global price of crude oil will inhibit this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to restore U.S. manufacturing and miss a golden opportunity to create high-paying middle class jobs and bring back economic prosperity.&#xD;

====Exporting LNG increases emissions and causes catastrophic warming and extinction====&#xD;
**Romm 12 **(Joe Romm – PhD from MIT, Fellow at American Progress, editor of Climate Progress, previously assistant secretary of energy for energy efficiency and renewable energy. &amp;#34;Exporting Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Is Bad For The Climate,&amp;#34; Jun 18, 2012 http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2012/06/18/500954/exporting-liquefied-natural-gas-lng-is-bad-for-the-climate/)&#xD;
The surge in U.S. production of shale gas is creating a surge in permit requests to build liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals. That~’s because the glut of U.S. gas has dropped domestic prices sharply below global price levels.&#xD;
LNG Value ChainBut if avoiding catastrophic climate change is your goal, then spending huge sums on even conventional natural gas infrastructure is not the answer, as a recent International Energy Agency report made clear:&#xD;
    The speciﬁc emissions from a gas-ﬁred power plant will be higher than average global CO2 intensity in electricity generation by 2025, raising questions around the long-term viability of some gas infrastructure investment if climate change objectives are to be met.&#xD;
And liquefying natural gas is an energy intensive and leaky process. When you factor in shipping overseas, you get an energy penalty of 20% or more. The extra greenhouse gas emissions can equal 30% or more of combustion emissions, according to a 2009 Reference Report by the Joint Research Centreof the European Commission, Liquefied Natural Gas for Europe – Some Important Issues for Consideration.&#xD;
Such extra emissions all but eliminate whatever small, short-term benefit there might be of building billion-dollar export terminals and other LNG infrastructure, which in any case will last many decades, long after the electric grid will not benefit from replacing coal with gas.&#xD;
Furthermore, the U.S. Energy Information Administration concluded in a 2012 report on natural gas exports done for DOE~’s Office of Fossil Energy that such exports would also increase domestic greenhouse gas emissions:&#xD;
    ~~W~~hen also accounting for emissions related to natural gas used in the liquefaction process, additional exports increase CO2 levels under all cases and export scenarios, particularly in the earlier years of the projection period.&#xD;
Asserting any net benefit for the importer requires assuming the new gas replaces only coal — and isn~’t used for, say, natural gas vehicles, which are worse for the climate or that it doesn~’t replace new renewables.  If even a modest fraction of the imported LNG displaces renewables, it renders the entire expenditure for LNG counterproductive from day one.&#xD;
Remember, a major new 2012 Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences study on &#xD;

Bloomberg 12 The Gas Is Always Greener When It Leaks Less Jun 13www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-06-13/the-gas-is-always-greener-when-it-leaks-less.html
A new escape route for methane will be opened as the U.S. begins exporting some of its natural-gas bounty. (With natural- gas prices at %249 per million BTU and higher in Europe and %2417 in Asia, a new facility in Louisiana to liquefy gas for export is on the drawing board.) Methane can escape during liquefaction, shipping and regasification at the receiving end. All these leaks, too, have to be measured.

**Methane  CO2**
**Frongillo 12** Dominic Frongillo - deputy town supervisor of Caroline, Tompkins County, and founder of Elected Officials to Protect New York , &amp;#34;Wrong Time to Push Fracking,&amp;#34;August 15, 2012  http://www.timesunion.com/opinion/article/Wrong-time-to-push-fracking-3788647.php-http://www.timesunion.com/opinion/article/Wrong-time-to-push-fracking-3788647.php)
Why should this ring alarm bells for Cuomo and every New Yorker?
Far from being a climate solution, fracking may be a disaster. Research indicates the methane leakage may mean that fracking is worse for the climate than coal and oil, particularly in the short term.
Gas from fracking is mostly methane, a dangerous greenhouse gas that is up to 105 times more powerful at trapping heat in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide over 20 years. A recent United Nations Environment Program report shows that it is more urgent to reduce methane than CO2, given that methane is so much more powerful, has quicker climate impacts, and will trigger runaway climate change sooner.
In February, the journal Nature reported on one of the first studies to look at methane emissions from fracking, a Colorado study led by researchers at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The study found 4 percent of gas drilled in fracking is venting directly into the atmosphere — even greater than the high-end estimate of the Cornell study and twice what was reported by the industry.
This is cause for grave concern. According to the Nobel Prize-winning Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, we must reduce our greenhouse gas emissions to avoid dangerous tipping points for the climate. Failing to do so will cause catastrophic impacts, far worse than the extreme heat and droughts this summer.
It may be that preventing hydraulic fracturing is crucial to stop a large new source of greenhouse gas emissions in New York. Fracking would release large amounts of methane that is now safety underground — cooking the planet further at the time when we most need to reduce methane emissions.
In Tompkins County, our Planning Department estimates that one well pad will release more climate pollution over its operational life than all of our county~’s 100,000 residents do in one year. Fracking may overwhelm and undermine the work of our governments, businesses, and institutions across the state to lessen our impact on the global climate.
New York State~’s Climate Action Plan interim report contains ambitious and necessary strategies to cut greenhouse gas emissions 80 percent by 2050. How would fracking in New York affect our ability to meet these targets?

====Most qualified studies prove====

The production of unconventional gas also contributes to the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases and

====Their internal link can~’t possibly affect emissions enough to solve warming====
Patrick J. **Michaels 7**, former program chair for the Committee on Applied Climatology of the American Meteorological Society, was a research professor of Environmental Sciences at University of Virginia for thirty years, was a contributing author and is a reviewer of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, February 2, 2007, &amp;#34;Live with Climate Change,&amp;#34; online: http://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/live-climate-change-http://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/live-climate-change
However, actually &amp;#34;doing something&amp;#34; about warming is a daunting endeavor. The journal Geophysical Research Letters estimated in 1997 that if every nation on Earth lived up to the United Nations~’ Kyoto Protocol on global warming, it would prevent no more than 0.126 degrees F of warming every 50 years. Global temperature varies by more than that from year to year, so that~’s not even enough to measure. Climatically, Kyoto would do nothing.
In the past four years, the Senate has voted twice against &amp;#34;cap-and-trade&amp;#34; legislation — sponsored by New Mexico senators Jeff Bingaman, a Democrat, and Pete Domenici, a Republican — that would set quotas on carbon emissions and let companies buy and sell them. If adopted, their cap-and-trade law would reduce emissions by less than the Kyoto Protocol specifies. In other words, the Senate has been loath to even adopt something that does less than nothing.
The stark reality is that if we really want to alter the warming trajectory of the planet significantly, we have to cut emissions by an extremely large amount, and — a truth that everyone must know — we simply do not have the technology to do so. We would fritter away billions in precious investment capital in a futile attempt to curtail warming.

====China alt cause====
Yvonne **Chan 9** in Hong Kong, BusinessGreen, 9/17/09, China~’s rapid growth imperils global climate change goal, says study, http://www.businessgreen.com/business-green/news/2249644/china-rapid-growth-imperils
China~’s booming economic growth imperils a global target to limit global warming to two degrees, according to a major new report from an influential government think-tank.
Released yesterday by the Energy Research Institute, China~’s Low Carbon Development Pathways by 2050 says that even if the nation were to embark on an aggressive strategy to cut greenhouse gas emissions, halting CO2 growth would be difficult given the country~’s current stage of rapid economic development.
&amp;#34;There is a huge number of cities to be built,&amp;#34; study co-author He Jiankun told reporters. &amp;#34;They will consume a large amount of steel and cement. This means that emissions will not be reduced for some time.&amp;#34;
The problem with the global target, according to the report, was that the two-degree limit – which was formally adopted by G8 nations in July – does not make adequate concessions for the industrialisation of developing countries.
The report said that in order to even get close to the target, it was up to wealthy nations to make carbon emission cuts of at least 90 per cent on 1990 levels by 2050. Otherwise, global temperatures will rise between 2.8 and 3.2 degrees above the pre-industrial average, estimated the report, which was conducted over a two-year period and had involved 10 independent institutes, including WWF and the US-based Energy Foundation.

====Positive feedbacks aren~’t physically possible—-best data overwhelmingly goes our way ====

====They have to win positive feedbacks to win an impact—-CO2~’s not enough on its own—-and most recent data suggests no feedbacks  ====
Fritz **Vahrenholt 12**, Honorary Professor of chemistry at the University of Hamburg, former Umweltsenator in the German Ministry for Environment, Scientific Reviewer for the 2010 IPCC, February 8, 2012, interviewed by Welt Online, a German newspaper, online: http://thegwpf.org/international-news/4932-the-cold-sun-why-the-climate-catastrophe-wont-happen.html
Welt Online: What are the core substantive findings that have prompted your changing of position?
Vahrenholt: I was previously unaware of the fact that CO2 is a greenhouse gas 
AND
that by the year 2020, the world will plunge into chaos.~’
Welt Online: So you do not deny that CO2 contributes to global warming?
Vahrenholt: It has undoubtedly made a contribution, but to a very much lower 
AND
increased, but also the radiation and the magnetic field of the sun.
I cannot say exactly whether the contribution of CO2 to global warming makes up 40, 50 or 60 percent. However, both factors play a role, and the influence of the sun is probably even a little stronger than that of CO2.
Welt Online: How do arrive at this estimate?
Vahrenholt: We have experienced a warming of 0.8 degrees Celsius since the end of the Little Ice Age. This is primarily due to the large millennial climate cycle in which the Earth warms in each of the first 200 years of the cycle. Between 1970 and 2000 there is a sharp increase in the average temperature, but the same rate of increase was also observed between 1910 and 1940 and between 1860 and 1880.
This is nothing extraodinary. If you look closely, you can see that this 
AND
The Atlantic Decadal Oscillation is also in decline, a little bit delayed.
A part of the warming is thus due to natural effects. The decisive shortcoming 
AND
up some of its former role as the key driver of global warming.
We note that global temperatures have plateaued for the last twelve years. The explanations of the climatologists are not enough to explain why there is a pause. The Pacific and Atlantic Oscillations are still not taken into account in their models.
