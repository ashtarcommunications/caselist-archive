====Role of the ballot– The judge should vote for the team whose perspective is the most life affirming.  Your framework attempts to establish a transcendent truth in debate which denies life.  This comes before framework even gets evaluated because it is a meta-ethical questions that asks what are the value of your values?  That~’s Smith.====&#xD;
&#xD;
====Counter-interpretation: the affirmative has to be in the direction of the resolution====&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
====	We meet the counter-interpretation because we criticize a restriction on wind power.====&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
====We are the heart of the topic – our Bisbee evidence says the number 1 obstacle to wind development is aesthetics.====&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
====You have no right to the ground of CP~’s or politics disads.  Our interpretation gives you the core negative ground of saying that restrictions on wind power are good and that wind power is unaesthetic.  ====&#xD;

====Debate is constantly changing making predictability impossible.  We must reject the attempt to establish a true method of debate====&#xD;

====Framework is a bad form of aesthetics.  ====&#xD;
&#xD;
==== It attempts to establish a harmony in debate.  This means it inevitably imposes standards that teams like OU will clash with causing them to stand out as unsightly eyesores that require ordering; however this will to order will fail because contingency is inevitable.  There will always be teams like us that make arguments you don~’t like.  This failure breeds ressentiment and hatred of the activity.  That~’s BRITTAN and** **Saurette.====&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
==== It seeks a disinterested standpoint from which we can objectively evaluate policy proposals.  This requires fleeing from the will because we must ignore questions of our orientation to the topic and how that impacts our value to life.  Instead you should vote aff precisely because it inspires an excitement of the will.  That~’s Nietzsche.====&#xD;
&#xD;
====If we win framework is a bad aesthetic then we win.  ====&#xD;
&#xD;
==== Aesthetics come first because we can only ever interact with the appearance of the world because there are no transcendental forms.  We must affirm this appearance otherwise we make the whole world ugly and negate life itself.  That~’s Doran and Nietzsche.====&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
==== Our lackey evidence indicates the 1Ac is an art object because it~’s design to liberate us from metaphysical standards of beauty.  And, their conceding that aesthetics can only be evaluated perspectivally because our opinions inevitably emanate from a standpoint  which is not absolute.  This means none of their arguments are even relevant to the consideration of the aff because they are not perspectives that say the 1AC~’s art is bad.====&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
====Ressentiment outweighs your framework impacts because it is hatred of life.  It is the will turning against itself in an act of self-mutilation that denies life that~’s Brober.  Education and fairness are meaningless without value to life.  Life affirmation is a prior issue because education and fairness are just values from a particular perspective, but life affirmation is the very standard by which we judge perspectives that~’s Smith.====&#xD;

====Epistemology DA – Framework crowds out all alternative ways of thinking because it sees itself as metaphysically binding.  This crushes creativity and locks us in prison walls that mandate a constant reconfirmation of what already think we know.  This their education has no value.  That~’s Lackey and Nehamas.====&#xD;

====The role of the ballot is to vote for whichever team is the most life affirming.  They may introduce other impacts but you should just view these impacts as competing perspectives of what is important.  The question you must ask is what is the value of their values?  The way to measure this is how life affirming they are.  This means life affirmation functions on a higher level than traditional debate impacts which you should only view as internal links to life affirmation.  That~’s Smith.====&#xD;
&#xD;
====Link turn: antiblackness is only powerful and dangerous because it is elevated to the level of a truth about the world and imposed violently on the world.  Perspectivism makes this impossible.====&#xD;
&#xD;
====Even if you weigh their impacts against life affirmation, the case still outweighs.  Life is still valuable regardless of circumstances and endpoints.  Even if we lose all of our link and permutation arguments it is better to live in a world of antiblackness than a world filled with resentment where he hate our lives and subordinate them to the ascetic ideal that we must dedication them entirely to fighting antiblackness as the ultimate evil that will never be eradicated.  That~’s Brobjer and Saurette.====&#xD;
&#xD;
====Link turn:  they say modernity is antiblackness – our Saurette evidence says the will to order is the fundamental principle of modernity.  Perspectival aesthetics is key to solve because we no longer try to control what we deem unaesthetic.====&#xD;
&#xD;
====Our aff doesn~’t presuppose a neutral or equal playing field.  We recognized that some people may be in more or less privileged positions.  The point is that no matter how oppressed we are we should still try to affirm our lives, which is not exclusive with fighting oppression.====&#xD;

&#xD;
====This puts them in a double bind – either the permutation solves or the alt is simply another morality of &amp;#34;thou shalt not.&amp;#34;  This means their system does not posit any positive values and begs the question of why life is worth living in a world where all we do is fight evil without every affirming anything.

====The 1Ac is an art object because it~’s design to liberate us from metaphysical standards of beauty.

====Modern objective notions of beauty come from Kant~’s definition that beauty &amp;#34;gives pleasure without interest.&amp;#34;  The idea that beauty can be looked upon without interest is, of course, absurd and underwritten by a life-denying desire to flee the will that only makes sense for someone who views life itself as torture.====

The affirmative argues that affirming the resolution through an indigenous epistemology lifts this restriction on wind power through the use of oral tradition and ceremonial understandings of wind power that break open the metaphysical stranglehold Eurocentric thinking has on debates over wind. This introduction of indigenous oral tradition and thought produces a cultural representation of the Indian as alive and not an artifact of the past that can be swept under the rug of colonial empires. It introduces elements of understanding the environment and the world around us that relate to Indian science and Indian ways of thinking that lie in oral tradition and ceremony. This rejection of western science fractures bad modes of ecological thinking that result in the imbalance of mother earth and replaces them with holistic understandings of the world that don&amp;#39;t draw boundaries between nature and culture. &#xD;

==================&#xD;
=======1AC========&#xD;
==================&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
We begin our investigation into this year&amp;#39;s topic with a story. &#xD;
&#xD;
Wind is a matter of interpretation, as the Laguna Pueblo author Leslie Silko in her groundbreaking work Ceremony, wrote: &#xD;
(Eric Cheyfitz, Professor of American Studies and Humane Letters, Cornell University. &amp;#34;Balancing the Earth: Native American Philosophies and the Environmental Crisis.&amp;#34; Arizona Quarterly: A Journal of American Literature, Culture, and Theory. Volume 65, Number 3, Autumn 2009, pp. 139-162. Project Muse)&#xD;
&#xD;
You see, Josiah had said... ...This earth keeps us going. &#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
These interpretations become a struggle between fundamental worldviews, one that continues today. Greg Cajete, in Native Science, said:&#xD;
(Eric Cheyfitz, Professor of American Studies and Humane Letters, Cornell University. &amp;#34;Balancing the Earth: Native American Philosophies and the Environmental Crisis.&amp;#34; Arizona Quarterly: A Journal of American Literature, Culture, and Theory. Volume 65, Number 3, Autumn 2009, pp. 139-162. Project Muse)&#xD;
&#xD;
We hope that sooner rather... ...is under absolute human control. &#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
However, control is an illusion that ignores wind power, as the Maricopa story &amp;#34;Cloud and Wind&amp;#34; reminds us... &#xD;
(The Bearksin Quiver, 2002)&#xD;
&#xD;
The cloud and the wind... ...not have many hard storms. &#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
Therefore, we affirm the resolution through an indigenous epistemology. &#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
This affirmation of the practice of storytelling and oral tradition embodies a de-centering of Western thought that acts as a lifeboat for methods and traditions that have been crowded out by colonialism&#xD;
Atalay 6&#xD;
(Sonya, Assistant Professor of Anthropology, Indiana University Bloomington. &amp;#34;Indigenous Archaeology as Decolonizing Practice&amp;#34;, American Indian Quarterly, Vol. 30, No. 3/4, Special Issue: Decolonizing Archaeology (Summer - Autumn 2006), pp. 280-310. JSTOR.)&#xD;
&#xD;
There are numerous concepts and... ...implications of practice that entails.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
As academics we should be particularly wary of creeping legacies of colonialism in our pedagogical practices - the loss of heritage should be considered cultural genocide. &#xD;
Graveline 98&#xD;
(Fyre Jean, BSW, MSW, PhD, M&amp;#39;etis feminist, &amp;#34;CIRCLE WORKS&amp;#34;, p. 28-30)&#xD;
&#xD;
Aboriginal people in the schools... ...their conduct toward others. &#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
Our affirmation of indigenous epistemologies provides a corrective to the Western scientific culture/nature divide that commodifies the environment and allows its destruction. Our epistemic break creates space for Native Science, a notion of natural democracy and kinship that resolves the West&amp;#39;s oppositional alienation. &#xD;
Cheyfitz 9&#xD;
(Eric Cheyfitz, Professor of American Studies and Humane Letters, Cornell University. &amp;#34;Balancing the Earth: Native American Philosophies and the Environmental Crisis.&amp;#34; Arizona Quarterly: A Journal of American Literature, Culture, and Theory. Volume 65, Number 3, Autumn 2009, pp. 139-162. Project Muse)&#xD;
&#xD;
Hence, the irony, or is... ...within the culture/nature opposition. &#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
This natural democracy is part of a cultural shift away from Western individualism, mechanism and objective cult rationality that produces a dialogue with nature as a member of the community of life - absent this shift the West will continue to consume the environment until nothing is left. &#xD;
Tinker 96&#xD;
(George, Defending Mother Earth: Native American Perspectives on Environmental Justice, 1996)&#xD;
&#xD;
Even in those cases in... ...can be destroyed with impunity. &#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
Our affirmation of indigenous epistemologies reclaims ceremony as a springboard for natural democracy. It opposes the capitalist power to profane all that&amp;#39;s sacred - Native Science inserts issues of social justice into discussions of technology and the imperial eradication of human and ecological communities&#xD;
Cheyfitz 9&#xD;
(Eric Cheyfitz, Professor of American Studies and Humane Letters, Cornell University. &amp;#34;Balancing the Earth: Native American Philosophies and the Environmental Crisis.&amp;#34; Arizona Quarterly: A Journal of American Literature, Culture, and Theory. Volume 65, Number 3, Autumn 2009, pp. 139-162. Project Muse)&#xD;
&#xD;
Let us take, for example... ...colonial and neo-colonial manifestations. &#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
Our invocation of Native Science counters the anthropological move to place the figure and culture of the Indian into the past as an artifact of study - the aff is key to animate the subjective and social nature of science and to bring significance to discussions of wind and the human place in the grand story of the world&#xD;
