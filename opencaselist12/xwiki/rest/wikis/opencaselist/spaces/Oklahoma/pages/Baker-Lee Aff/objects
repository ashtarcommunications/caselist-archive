Space Traders by Derek Bell

1 January. The first ... Professor Golightly

Golightly did not look ... our very subordination.

Whites exploit not only our music ... The Reverend Jasper.

Back and forth performance about the White Caucus deciding what to do, and then the Black Caucus

we create our own meaning and identity
Birt 04 &amp;#34;The Bad Faith of Whiteness&amp;#34; in George Yancy, ed. What White Looks Like: African-American Philosophers on the Whiteness Question, 55-64

For Sartre, freedom is the most fundamental truth ... ambiguities of our existence.

deconstructing whiteness is the key to ontologically unfreezing any non-white Body as the Other or a Criminal
Yancy 04 &amp;#34;Introduction: Fragments of a Social Ontology of Whiteness,&amp;#34; What White Looks Like: African-American Philosophers on the Whiteness Question, 1-24

The police officers ... of negative ontologization.

whiteness manifests itself through the use of representations, and the manipulation of those representations to reify a world of &amp;#34;reality&amp;#34; that will best benefit those who reside on the powerful side of white supremacy
Yancy 04 &amp;#34;Introduction: Fragments of a Social Ontology of Whiteness,&amp;#34; What White Looks Like: African-American Philosophers on the Whiteness Question, 1-24

One way of challenging ... world-making of whiteness itself.

Poem

Stay or go its not a debate
In reality Caucasians say yes everday
just blame it on society constructs and cap interplay
Hell even Blacks give into saying yes somedays
Like buying into curly hair being bad, good hair being straight
&amp;#34;That&amp;#39;s just the way it is,&amp;#34; How Tupac called it
White welfare in the center, Black well-being in the margins
Private corporations making profits off of niggaz catching charges
Living in the ghettos like crabs in a bucket
Gotta pull another brotha down to get closer to the surface
Sayin oneday you&amp;#39;re here and the next day your gone
To justify pushing a substance killing people of your own
Alota people say yes everyday, so if the aliens do it was wrong
So Ima get my locks done and put my best threads on
Get some Pepsi, Hennessey, and some Bob Marley Bomb
Ima be dressed good and feeling good, on the space ship gone

America getting safe nuclear energy for Blacks Outer Space our new home...</headline></objectSummary></objects>
