Plan:  The United States federal government should remove restrictions on tribal authority to trade tax credits and should authorize American Indian eligibility for Production Tax credits.

Contention 1: Native American Economy
The current Wind Production Tax Credits function as disincentives to Native Americans because of the unique context of tribal status.
Spears 6 - (Patrick, President of Intertribal Council On Utility Policy, “Tribal Joint Venture Production Tax Credit: An Intertribal COUP Background Policy Paper for a Comparable and Appropriate Tribal Energy Production Incentive”, http://www.tribesandclimatechange.org/docs/tribes_186.doc) T.

&amp;#34;Fortunately, tribal elders possess world views and life-ways  … as well as an exemplary step back for us all from the brink of &amp;#34;global burning.&amp;#34;

Up until the past few weeks, there had been a lot of hoopla  … South Dakota&amp;#39;s overall unemployment rate is 4.7 percent, exclusive of reservations.

Harff and Gur 81 
(Barbara, Prof of Political Science Emerita @ U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, MD, “Humanitarian Intervention As A Remedy For Genocide,”, p. 40)
One of the most enduring and abhorrent problems of the world is genocide, which is neither particular to a specific race, class, or nation, nor is it rooted in any one, ethnocentric view of the world. …. Since virtually every social group is a potential victim, genocide is a universal concern. 
 


Self-Determination – 1AC
Contention 2: Self-Determination
Status quo precludes self-determination by creating dependency and undermining resource autonomy.
Hall ‘4 - (Tex Hall, President of the National Congress of American Indians, 3-1-2004, http://www.eere.energy.gov/windandhydro/windpoweringamerica/filter_detail.asp?itemid=678andprint)

Tribal sovereignty may be the number one concern of tribes. Indeed, one prominent legal scholar identifies the right of self-government as the tribes&amp;#39; most valuable reserved right. 90 Historically, tribes have had good reason to fear a loss of sovereignty, 91 and modern jurisprudence has done little to assure them of their long-term status. …  Or, as one scholar put it, &amp;#34;A federal Indian policy that focuses on the exploitation of tribal natural resources, and not on the development of tribal economies, is doomed to resistance and failure.&amp;#34; 98  Much research has been done over the past decade on the factors that make tribal economies prosper, notably by Stephen Cornell, Joseph Kalt, Jonathan  *290   

This goes global – the plan creates a predictable model for self-determination prevents conflict and wars.
Morris 92 (Associate Poli Sci Professor—University of Colorado (James, The State of Native America, Ed.  pp. 78-9)

Muller 8

But none of this will make ethnonationalism go away. Immigrants to the United States usually arrive with a willingness to fit into their new country and reshape their identities accordingly.

Kashmir secession leads to indo-pak war – it’s the root of all their conflict

(Nirpal, former London Evening Standard columnist now working for New Delhi, 6/8, “Not so fast”, http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/jun/08/kashmir.pakistan) T. Snider
Kashmiris do have a right to autonomy and self-determination. But India has an overwhelming right to protect its security and territorial integrity and spread its democratic values. …. While Kashmir may be a pawn in Pakistan&amp;#39;s regional game, the Pakistanis themselves are merely pawns in a much bigger Chinese one.

Indo-Pak war over Kashmir goes nuclear

Contention 3: Solvency
The plan resolves all the issues with Native American and wind energy

To help resolve the problems outlined above, Congress should institute taxcredit tradability for tribes, including a tradable PTC. …. The federal government would contribute the tax credits. 

Additionally, PTCs give natives access to huge revenue opportunities for a self-sustained economy
Shahiniam 8’
(Mark, Michigan Law, Tax Man Cometh Not: How the Non-Transferability of Tax Credits Harms Indian Tribes, 32 Am. Indian L. Rev. 267, http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?collection=journalsandhandle=hein.journals/aind32andpage=267) AL 
The importance of tax credits goes beyond the merely theoretical. Tax credits for renewable energy are substantial - one study found the PTC contributes 17% of a wind project&amp;#39;s bottom line&amp;#39;&amp;#39;  …. This 34% premium is too big for tribes to overcome in electricity markets that routinely see wholesale electricity prices average $23/MWh -about the same as the S 18 difference between the $71/MWh and $53/MWh price points.&amp;#39; 2 
The development of wind energy on tribal lands is key to establishing self-sustainability, providing for a higher quality of life. The plan is the necessary affirmation of tribal sovereignty, reorienting existing energy relationship.

Energy development can play and important role in economic development by building capacity within tribes and by providing revenues  …  The lack of control was associated with very little economic benefits to the tribes.  

There are multiple incentives for Native American wind power now, but none of them work.
Sullivan 10
(Bethany, J.D. Candidate, University of Arizona James E. Rogers College of Law, Arizona Law Review Fall 2010, “Changing Winds: Reconfiguring The Legal Framework For Renewable-Energy Development In Indian Country”) T. Snider
Solutions to this problem have developed on the federal and individual level, yet have largely fallen short. The federal government attempted to level the playing field for governments (including tribes) by enacting Clean Renewable-Energy bonds (CREBs), which function as a type of interest-free loan for financing certain types of energy projects. .... While these problems are addressed by the alternative of flipagreements, these agreements essentially relegate tribes to the sidelines for the first decade or so of the project, leaving tribal governments with little control over the decisions, management, and future of their on-reservation projects. 79
