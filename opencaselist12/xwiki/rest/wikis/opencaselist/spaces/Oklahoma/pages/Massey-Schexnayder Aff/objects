We are open to the topic, which allows us it to reveal itself in a multitude of ways.  We don’t immediately act instead we take time to consider our relation with the production of energy.  &#xD;
Odysseos 2007 ~-~- Senior Lecturer in International Relations at University of Sussex (Louiza, “The Subject of Coexistence,” p. 108)&#xD;

&amp;#34;What is of concern is whether the charge of &amp;#34;decisionism&amp;#34; re-¶ verses the &amp;#34;unworking&amp;#34; of modern subjectivity through the articulation of the various elements of the optics of coexistence as outlined¶ in the previous chapter....Next, the kind of transcendence entailed in¶ Dasein&amp;#39;s becoming-proper is examined alongside the concerns that¶ it necessitates a flight from worldly embeddedness indicated by the¶ optics of coexistence in chapter 3.&amp;#34;&#xD;
&#xD;
Modern energy production is oriented around a challenging of nature that is premised on a larger technological mode of Being that seeks to extract, store, and place energy and all of nature at our disposal.  This places nature into a state of standing reserve.  &#xD;
Beckman 2000 – Emertius Professor of Philosophy at Harvey Mudd College (Tad, “Martin Heidegger and Environmental Ethics,” http://www2.hmc.edu/~tbeckman/personal/Heidart.html)&#xD;
&#xD;
&amp;#34;Perhaps it is not difficult to understand the separate paths of the fine arts, craftsmanship, and modern technology. Each seems to have followed different human intentions and to have addressed different human skills...In the era of techne humans were relationally involved with other objects in the coming to presence; in the era of modern technology, humans challenge-forth the subjectively valued elements of the universe so that, within this new form of revealing, objects lose their significance to anything but their subjective status of standing-ready for human design. (8)&amp;#34;&#xD;
&#xD;
The logic of the standing reserve places all of nature as an object for human domination and control.  &#xD;
Xuanmeng 3 (Yu, “Heidegger on Technology Alienation and Destiny,” Chinese Culture Chinese Philosophical Studies, XI, Cultural Heritage and Contemporary Change Series II, Asia, Vol II, http://www.crvp.org/book/Series03/III-11/chapter_ii.htm)&#xD;
&#xD;
&amp;#34;First, &amp;#34;The revealing that rules in modern technology is a challenging (Herausfordern)&amp;#34;.7 Herausfordern is formed by a verb root fordern (which means to summon, to demand, to challenge) and two adverbial prefixes: her-(hither) and aus-(out)...To ¶ understand this seemingly strange statement, we should recall that by &amp;#34;the essence of technology&amp;#34;, he is concerned not with &amp;#34;what modern technology is,&amp;#34; but with a process or phenomenon.&amp;#34;&#xD;
&#xD;
This standing reserve is the result of a Will that seeks to reduce the world into an orderable and predictable framework.  This ontology represents a constant consumption which renders all beings as objects which allows for large scale warfare and environmental destruction.  &#xD;
Zimmerman 81 (Michael, Professor of Philosophy at Tulane University, “Eclipse of the Self: The Development of Heidegger’s Concept of Authenticity,” p. 220-224)&#xD;
&#xD;
&amp;#34;In 1951 Heidegger noted that Spengler’s ideas of the “decline of the West” is “only negative, though correct, consequence of Nietzsche’s word, ‘the wasteland grows’.”...“Before Being can occur in its primal truth, Being as the will must be broken, the world must be forced to collapse and the earth must be driven to desolation, and man to more labor.” (VI,I, 65/86) But even the devastation of the wars did not essentially change the situation in the modern world.&amp;#34;&#xD;
&#xD;
There are fates worse than death to maintain our biological definition of life by sacrificing the foundations of which makes life worth living is to reside in a perpetual state of dying far worse than nuclear annihilation.  &#xD;
Zimmerman 94 (Michael E., Professor of Philosophy at Tulane University, Contesting Earth’s Future: Radical Ecology and Postmodernity, 119-20)&#xD;
&#xD;
&amp;#34;Heidegger asserted that human self-assertion, combined with the eclipse of being, threatens the relation between being and human Dasein...loss of humanity&amp;#39;s relation to being would be worse than nuclear omnicide, for it is wrong to suppose that the lives of millions of extinct and unknown species are somehow lessened because they were never &amp;#34;disclosed&amp;#34; by humanity.&amp;#34;&#xD;
&#xD;
  It is precisely this moment of crisis that is most appropriate for our act of openness.  A reconsideration of our calculative relation energy is a necessary response to the environmental concerns of the status quo.  &#xD;
Ziarek 12 (Krzysztof, Professor of Comparative Literature at SUNY-Buffalo, “The Global Unworld: A Meditative Manifesto”, Impasses of the Post-Global: Theory in the Era of Climate Change, Vol. 2/, [Alcibiades and Lenny])&#xD;
&#xD;
&amp;#34;At issue, as I suggested earlier, is where to begin, and keep beginning, so that the world would be allowed to world and not just unfold globally into an unworld...Technicity revealing its unsuspected face, and this ambiguous two-face en-countered as the opportunity of crisis, of holding open for deciding. The crisis of (un)worlding.&amp;#34;&#xD;
&#xD;
Traditional politics involve a violent imposition of a program on being that attempts to order both physical and human nature.  Our thinking represents an opening that is the only conceivable way to create a politics that doesn’t subordinate everything to technological understanding.  &#xD;
Geiman 1 – Faculty Member Department of Philosophy Saint Xavier University (Clare Pearson, “Heideggers Antigones,” http://sxu.academia.edu/ClarePearson/Papers/546770/Heideggers_Antigones)&#xD;
&#xD;
&amp;#34;With the move to poetic thinking, Heidegger&amp;#39;s characterization of the &amp;#34;destiny&amp;#34; of the West thus turns decisively away from the violence of creative¶ founding in the direction of the later Gelassenheit, the &amp;#34;releasement...yet it remains compelling that the best way to confront large-¶ scale violence is to reshape our personal and political action in such a way that¶ it is fundamentally nonviolent. Poetic thinking points to just such a move.&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&#xD;
&#xD;
The affirmative is a tactic of everyday resistance that opens a practical form of Dasein by rupturing cracks in dominant ideology through thought itself.  &#xD;
Bleiker 2000 – Senior lecturer and coordinator of peace and conflict studies @ University of Queensland (Roland, Popular Dissent: Human Agency and Global Politics p. 210-11)&#xD;
&#xD;
&amp;#34;While providing compelling evidence of subtle forms of domination,¶ a discursive approach may run the risk of leaving us with an¶ image of the world in which the capacity for human agency is all¶ but erased, annihilated by impenetrable discursive forces...It is in these¶ spheres that societal values are gradually transformed, preparing the¶ ground for more open manifestations of dissent.&amp;#34;&#xD;
&#xD;
Ontology is fundamental and inescapable ~-~- it shapes all decision-making and an ontological-flawed position dooms any action to failure.  &#xD;
Dillon 95 (Michael, Professor of Politics and International Relations at Lancaster University, Moral Spaces: Rethinking Ethics and World Politics, Eds. David Campbell and Michael J. Shapiro 1999 96-98)&#xD;
&#xD;
&amp;#34;The question of ontology was not only reposed, however; the charge was also laid, to equally devastating effect, that the onto-theological yearnings that characterized Western thought were the source of its own understated but pervasive life-inimical violence...This applies, indeed applies most, to those mock-innocent political slaves who claim only to be technocrats of decision making.&amp;#34;&#xD;
&#xD;
Our framework for debate is valuable.  Excluding our approach would be to technological enframe debate to ensure infinite reproduction of the status quo.  Opening debate to innovation increases critical thinking.  &#xD;
Shanahan and Heidegger 93 (William and Martin, “Kritik of Thinking” Debaters Research Guide, http://groups.wfu.edu/debate/MiscSites/DRGArticles/Shanahan1993HealthCare.htm)&#xD;
	&#xD;
&amp;#34;Policy has a stranglehold on debate worthy of any NYC transit cop. Argument must conform to rigid policy prescriptions - not only are particular types of arguments deemed unacceptable, whole ways of thinking are excluded also... By thinking along different paths however, the possibility that new perspectives will open remains above.&amp;#34;     </headline></objectSummary></objects>
