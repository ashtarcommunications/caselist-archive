Risk is inherent – their fear of life robs them of everything worth living for. This creates a negative Will to Power which rejects the “bad” parts of life.

When I was a young student at Columbia ...but become themselves impossible to imagine.

Advocacy: Give Turtle Island back to the “Savage.” Give Life Itself back to the “Slave.” 

Yes, I am sure we are crazy. 

A Safe space has been cleared for us to have debates, get an education, film the movies like stagecoach.  The west is safe, but then the “savage” becomes a threat and attacks the stagecoach……..Which overwrites the original encounter where the “savage” was cleared to create the roads by which the slaves would build and the stagecoach would travel in the first place and then filmed by movie makers.

Your 1ac functions to write over the USFG as a noun, but refuses to understand how the USFG labors on the body of the “Savage” as a verb.  The essential status of the USFG as a noun in the resolution produces genocide and the slave. 
Seeing things though the only ethical demand would be to say something like “your baby civil society suckeled indian blood instead of white breast milk.

Wilderson 10 141-145
Well over twenty thousand Westerns ... “transition” is merely a euphemism for disavowal).

Your Intellectual protocols hides grammars of suffering.  The state functions to magnify the suffering through the ability to create hegemony of accepted ideas where revolution becomes death in the academy.   The distance between the protester and the police has narrowed and leftist protocols tend to hider rather make explicit grammars of suffering.  Even the left leaning scholars become tools of hegemony and function to help recuperate and maintain stability of violence.

Their state based politics relies on a civil society that is structurally parasitic on the suffering of the slave.  The subject position that we are describing cannot be accomodated by an elastic political economy, reducing the radical positionality of the slave to a mere worker – it is defined by its antithesis to the political millieu championed by the aff and by the violence that world does.

There is a grammar of assumptions regarding the ontology of suffering.
Political discourse assumes an ontological grammar and that assumptive structure of suffering crowds out other structures of suffering.

Semiotics and linguistics teach us ... films and political theory that follo

Black =’s Slave.  That is the ontology.  Blacks went on the ship as Africans and came off as slaves.  Anti-black violence occurs on a different ontological register than any other form of violence.  Intra-human violence is ended when the marginalized are humanized.  Blackness is anti-human, its very condition of possibility is gratuitous violence.
