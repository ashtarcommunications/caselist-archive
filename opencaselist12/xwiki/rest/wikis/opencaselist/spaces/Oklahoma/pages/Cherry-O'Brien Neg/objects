Energy production is some banal shit – using the world as a source of energy to be ‘used’ reduces existence to self-interest and slides into nihilism, as if energy can be stockpiled, why not humans for the same end, to unlock use? This is the circularity of utility –fossil fuels are burnt to wage wars to get fossil fuels. Nuclear war doesn’t loom in the irrationality of the international arena but becomes feasible only when tendency to expend is papered over by ‘useful’ policy goals.  &#xD;
Stoekl 7 [Allan, Professor of French and Comparative Literature at Penn State University, Bataille’s Peak: Energy, Religion, and Postsustainability, 53-59](garreth)&#xD;
“Bad duality,” as I crudely put it, is the indulgence … been transformed in and through death, have disappeared.&#xD;
&#xD;
Rational state action is ridiculous – the construction of an orderly state is based on fascist desires and guarantees violence as energies break free from the banality of government. The fear of anarchic, “headless” society is not neutral but the deification of the monocephalic state to deny our own drives toward chaos.&#xD;
Hamblet 5 [Wendy, ethics/philosophy, adelphi university, “The Manic Ecstasy of War”, Peace Review 17, 39-42]&#xD;
Eli Sagan’s At the Dawn of Tyranny posits … ordered populations enslaved to reason and utility.&#xD;

Risk management and calculation fails because of excess of IR → intervention&#xD;

Still hot in pursuit of Bataille&amp;#39;s horizon, we can now imagine … quickly becomes indifferent to its prize and impatient with itself.&#xD;

Reject the aff&#xD;
Stoekl 7 [Allan, Professor of French and Comparative Literature at Penn State University, Bataille’s Peak: Energy, Religion, and Postsustainability, 42-46](garreth)&#xD;
And yet, if we think a bit more deeply … perhaps, the world’s (but not modernity’s) survival. &#xD;

US leadership is unsustainable and ⇒ mass suffering, militarism and conflict&#xD;

At present, U.S. imperialism appears … the others—and hence the entire system.&#xD;

In a nation like ours, where military might trumps …—no easy task—it will continue to work its evil.&#xD;

We are already dead – the affirmative’s attempt to make us care about nuclear war and deprive life of risk makes life vacuous. Forget the bomb.&#xD;
Baudrillard 88 [Jean, undissimulator, America, 40-42]&#xD;
Everywhere survival has become a burning issue… a political fact of the utmost importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
Allowing mechanized energy to run out, and accepting the uncertainty it entails, is good.&#xD;
Stoekl 7 [Allan, Bataille’s Peak: Energy, Religion, and Postsustainability, 202-205](garreth)&#xD;
And a number of authors recently have been … the movement of expenditure at its Varda-esque heart.38&#xD;
&#xD;
Turns case, terrorism isn’t proximately caused but the underside of the aff’s globalization.&#xD;
Baudrillard 1 [Jean, the dudest of bros, “The Spirit of Terrorism”, Le Monde 2 November]&#xD;
It is almost they who did it, but we … it is the world itself which resists domination.&#xD;
&#xD;
The drive for accumulation → increasing energy efficiency doesn’t “solve” scarcity but increases supply such that total energy usage rebounds to outweigh energy saved.&#xD;

This led to the resurrection, at the end of the 1970s … “central materials” or “staple products” – are concerned.&#xD;

The West is only able to maintain its hegemony because it disavows the genocidal act of clearing that maintains the coherence of the white body. &#xD;

(Frank “Unspeakable Ethics”, Red, White, and Black: Cinema and the Structure of U.S. Antagonisms, 141-5, [GLOB])&#xD;
Well over twenty thousand Westerns...“transition” is merely a euphemism for disavowal).&#xD;
&#xD;
Political sphere bad&#xD;
Wilderson 3 [Frank, “Gramsci’s Black Marx: Whither the Slave in Civil Society?” http://www.nathanielturner.com/gramsciblackmarx.htm](glob)&#xD;
Civil society is the terrain where hegemony is produced...the understudy of Gramsci’s hegemony.&#xD;
&#xD;
The violence of civil society exists in excess of political rationality, a constant reenactment of the violence of the Middle Passage that is ontological.&#xD;
Wilderson 10 [Frank, Red, White, and Black: Cinema and the Structure of U.S. Antagonisms, Chapter Two]&#xD;
The violence of the Middle Passage ...exploited and alienated subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
discourses that begin with governmental change operate on a progressive assumption that the State is benevolent. There is no reform: their thinking obfuscates our vision of the enemy, ensuring cooption. &#xD;

Just as there are two energetic sources... and through death, have disappeared.

Your aff  is a fig leaf that depoliticizes American panoptic regulation of international nuclear exchanges, directly legitimizing securitizing violence against those outside of this newfound epistemic community of peace. 
Peter Stoett, Department of Political Science @ Concordia, 2003, “Toward Renewed Legitimacy? Nuclear Power, Global Warming, and Security” Global Environmental Politics 3:1 P. MUSE
The nuclear industry, and its state protectors and promoters... surveillance function at the international level.
 
The politics of the standing reserve reduce all beings to objects of its own manipulation—destroys value to life by sacrificing ethics in the name of protecting instrumental value
Mitchell, 2k5 
(Andrew J., Stanford University, “Heidegger and Terrorism”, Research in Phenomenology, 35)
The elimination of difference in the...resources do not die, they perish.

There are fates worse than death to maintain our biological definition of life by sacrificing the foundations of which makes life worth living is to reside in a perpetual state of dying far worse than nuclear annihilation.  
Zimmerman 94 (Michael E., Professor of Philosophy at Tulane University, Contesting Earth’s Future: Radical Ecology and Postmodernity, 119-20)
Heidegger asserted that human self-assertion, combined with...because they were never &amp;#34;disclosed&amp;#34; by humanity.
