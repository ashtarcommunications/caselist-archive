That means our moral interpretations  are a symptom of a violent Will to Order which are based against the world as it exists. This constant disavowal of the unordered world misaligned with our explanatory models breeds Ressentiment, and causes the tragedy we seek to purge

Our critique doesn’t only apply to the moralism of long ago, tyrants of the spirit seek to produce a once-and-for-all interpretation of what it means to be resulting in a denigration of individuals to sameness and an impetus for oppression

**We should say “Yes” to the affirmative, the fear of our demise ought not to be a reason to vote negative, because that would mean making a decision that kills us 1000 times in our own lifetime. To refuse to react in this manner provides a new manner of decision making that can produce joy and noble values.**
