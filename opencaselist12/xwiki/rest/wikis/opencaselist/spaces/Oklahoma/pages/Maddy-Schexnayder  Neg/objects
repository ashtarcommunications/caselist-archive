Modern energy production is oriented around a challenging of nature that is premised on a larger technological mode of Being that seeks to extract, store, and place energy and all of nature at our disposal.  This places nature into a state of standing reserve.

Focus on subjective violence and easily identifiable flashpoints of conflict misses the boat – only focusing on the background or objective violence can solve root cause – cannot be viewed from the same stand point – the call to act will be strong but responding creates a stop-gap which prevents engaging in criticisms of capital
