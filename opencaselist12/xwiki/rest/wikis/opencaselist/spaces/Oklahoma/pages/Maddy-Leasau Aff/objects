Incorporating loss into identity makes space for transformation and an acceptance of primary vulnerability. The subject reconciles past with present through the ability to build the present with the ruins of the past.&#xD;

Contrary to right-wing… proposes to freeze!

The United States Federal Government should offer to provide for all costs of the development of wind projects. 

The aesthetic nature of wind turbines symbolize coexistence with the environment – leads to dealing with loss.

Redistribution of capital from the state is tied to the conception of what is a valuable life, and occurs not only on a state, but individual level.

The big question… fantasy, politically) too.

A reevaulation of what constitutes a livable life creates space for openness to difference and an avoidance of totalitarianism.

So if an intimate… capitalist stress position

Acceptance of the primary vulnerability to violence creates potential for non-violent action.

Mourning, fear, anxiety, rage…. world formerly was orderly. 


Status quo fiscal policy dictates that the state be dependent upon finance capital, but the public be independent from the state. This politics of austerity allocates vulnerability differently for some more than others.

Polly Toynbee wrote… down too easily.

This vulnerability is taken advantage of by society to render some lives more grievable than others.

Consider that the struggle… depend in order to be. 


Imagining an alternative to capitalism isn’t enough – economist logic is inevitable. Instead, the state should be compassionate in its providing of welfare to its people.
