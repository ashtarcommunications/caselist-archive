Lastly the discourse of both state and business needs taking seriously – not only its cynicism but also in its indifference for the chief victims, present and future. ….. social behaviour and the energy economy move towards de-carbonification at the pace necessary to stabilise climate change in 50 years’ time – or perhaps ever. 

Focus on subjective violence and easily identifiable flashpoints of conflict misses the boat – only focusing on the background or objective violence can solve root cause – cannot be viewed from the same stand point – the call to act will be strong but responding creates a stop-gap which prevents engaging in criticisms of capital  
Zizek 2008 Slavoj Violence p 1-4 
If there is a unifying thesis that runs through the bric-a-brac of reflections on violence that follow, it is that a similar paradox holds true for violence. …. The only appropriate approach to my subject thus seems to be one which permits variations on violence kept at a distance out of respect towards its victims.

Resisting reliance on economic evaluation is the ultimate ethical responsibility – the current social order guarantees social exclusion on a global scale 
Zizek and Daly 2k4 (Slavoj and Glyn, Conversations with Zizek page 14-16)
For Zizek it is imperative that we cut through this Gordian knot of postmodern protocol and recognize that our ethico-political responsibility is to confront the constitutive violence of today’s global capitalism and its obscene naturalization / anonymization of the millions who are subjugated by it throughout the world. ….  While it is perfectly true that universalism can never become Universal (it will always require a hegemonic-particular embodiment in order to have any meaning), what is novel about Zizek’s universalism is that it would not attempt to conceal this fact or reduce the status of the abject Other to that of a ‘glitch’ in an otherwise sound matrix. 

Demand for urgency is a product of hypocritical outrage meant to extend the privilege of global capitalism – our alternative is to do nothing in the face of the affirmative  
Zizek 2008 Slavoj Violence p 6-8
Let’s think about the fake sense of urgency that pervades the left-liberal humanitarian discourse on violence: in it, abstraction and graphic (pseudo)concreteness coexist in the staging of the scene of violence—against women, blacks, the homeless, gays. . . “…..And then, what do you do?” “I go to a solitary place to learn, learn, and learn!”  Is this not exactly what Lenin did after the catastrophe of 1914? He withdrew to a lonely place in Switzerland, where he “learned, learned, and learned,” reading Hegel’s logic. And this is what we should do today when we find ourselves bombarded with mediatic images of violence. We need to “learn, learn, and learn” what causes this violence.</headline></objectSummary><objectSummary><link rel="http://www.xwiki.org/rel/object" href="http://opencaselist.paperlessdebate.com/xwiki/rest/wikis/opencaselist/spaces/Oklahoma/pages/Landes-Snider%20Neg/objects/Admin.EntryClass/1"/><link rel="http://www.xwiki.org/rel/properties" href="http://opencaselist.paperlessdebate.com/xwiki/rest/wikis/opencaselist/spaces/Oklahoma/pages/Landes-Snider%20Neg/objects/Admin.EntryClass/1/properties"/><id>opencaselist:Oklahoma.Landes-Snider Neg:a6f3b8be-e621-47b7-a118-0ca1b0ddc705</id><guid>a6f3b8be-e621-47b7-a118-0ca1b0ddc705</guid><pageId>opencaselist:Oklahoma.Landes-Snider Neg</pageId><wiki>opencaselist</wiki><space>Oklahoma</space><pageName>Landes-Snider Neg</pageName><className>Admin.EntryClass</className><number>1</number><headline>The 1AC is a typical leftist response to international oppression that remains silent in the  face of the on-going colonization of native North America.  The plan serves as a mask for  the state, making it appear benevolent, even as its existence is contingent upon a continuing  legacy of colonization that guarantees continued international exploitation, turning the  case.  
Ward Churchill 1996 (Professor of Ethnic Studies at University of Colorado, Boulder, BA and MA in 
Communications from Sangamon State, From A Native Son pgs 520 – 530)   
I’ll debunk some of this nonsense in a moment, but first I want to take up the posture of self-proclaimed leftist radicals in the  same connection….  It follows that realization of  indigenous land rights serves to undermine or destroy the ability of the status quo to continue imposing a  racist, sexist, classist, homophobic, militaristic order on non-Indians.    


B) The Alternative is to reject the Affirmative and pursue indigenous land return as a first  priority. This act of impossible realism solves the case—Colonization is the root cause of  oppression, exploitation and war. Only a return to an indigenous politics can remedy the  ills of colonialism. 
 Ward Churchill 1996 (Professor of Ethnic Studies at University of Colorado, Boulder, BA and MA in 
Communications from Sangamon State, From A Native Son pgs 85-90) 
 The question which inevitably arises with regard to indigenous land claims, especially in the United States, is  whether they are “realistic.” The answer, of course is, “No, they aren’t.” Further, no form of decolonization  has ever been realistic when viewed within the construct of a colonialist paradigm… That’s our vision of “impossible realism.” Isn’t it time we all worked on attaining it?

This perspective ignores the intrinsic meaning of nature and instead replaces it with the desire for unlimited control and domination of the natural world.  
Xuanmeng 3( Yu, “Heidegger on Technology, Alienation and Destiny,” The Humanization of Technology and Chinese Culture Chinese Philosophical Studies, XI, Cultural Heritage and Contemporary Change, Series II, Asia, Vol 11, http://www.crvp.org/book/Series03/III-11/contents.htm)

A technological approach to the world forces a conceptualization of things as commodities to be used and manipulated by humans.  We lose our ability to stand-open to nature’s revealing of itself and believe ourselves to be the ‘Lords of the Earth,’ failing to realize that it is both nature and ourselves that have become the victims of technological manipulation.
Condella 1(Craig A., Fordham University, “Overcoming the Destining Of Technological Being,” Fall 2001 Symposium:Humanity’s Place in the Cosmos, November 6, 2001, http://www.fordham.edu/philosophy/fps/symposia/2001fall/condella.htm)
What, then, is the essence of technology? In searching for an answer 
AND
can we even begin to overcome the danger harbored within its very essence.

Our inability to perceive the essence of the world and instead replace it with the commodification constructed by a technological world view prevents us from authentically being in the world and leaves us in a state of ontological damnation resulting in complete nuclear annihilation  
Zimmerman 94 (Michael E., Professor of Philosophy at Tulane University, Contesting Earth’s Future: Radical Ecology and Postmodernity, 119-20)
Heidegger asserted that human self-assertion, combined with the eclipse of being, 
AND
species are somehow lessened because they were never &amp;#34;disclosed&amp;#34; by humanity.

Instead of framing nature as an instrumental means to the ends of the plan, we must let nature emerge for itself rather than for us.  This involves stepping-back from the values and notions instilled by technological management and ‘letting nature be.’

Contemporary ethical discussions in regard to the environment often take on the form of future

the cosmos will remain primarily a question about the cosmos’s place in humanity.

Here’s the text to our alternative: refuse the affirmative. 
Frantic activity in the name of fixing the world is the end result of a system of thinking which precludes any real change.  Instead of relying upon technological thought, we must embrace the paradox that seemingly ‘doing nothing’ brings within us in order to cultivate a new understanding of action.
