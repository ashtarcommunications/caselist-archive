As a judge you are a reactant responding to this debate. As a rhetorical artifact, you might expect this 1AC to make sense. But what about objects that defy human expectations? 
So-called HYPER-OBJECTS have properties not directly assessable to human experience. For example, plutonium 239 is a hyperobject—Its fissiles reactions and radioactive decay defy the intuitions and timescales of the clever apes who claim to manufacture the stuff. Plutonium drives the fragile expectations of federal government actants incentivizing nuclear power production. 
The resolution is also a hyper-object—You cannot rely on your ‘gut’ intuitions but must instead engage in rigorous empirical inquiry: Begin your decision with a response to the agent of resolutional action; in this case, we expect an affirmation of the agency of plutonium 239. 
The process creating plutonium began as flurries of protons and neutrons mixed and matched through a process called FUSION—Hydrogen plus hydrogen yields helium PLUS energy—Beginning cycles of galaxies and stars that after 9 billions years created this debate.
Humans saw a shining ball spinning around our Earth—But eventually we are leaning that we are not the center of everything. 
We are showered with light dispersed by the sun’s fusion of hydrodgen into helium—And yet this feeble star is nowhere hot enough to fuse together  92 neutrons with 92 protons.
Only the hottest supernovas spurts out Plutonium 239, and this fragile byproduct quickly decays into the more prosaic Uranium 235.
And yet the potential of Plutonium 239 calls us to react.  Its byproduct Uranium migrates from the Earth’s mantle to its crust. It takes two billions years—a timeframe not accessible to human intuition. 
Uranium-235 is quite feisty. The first (seventeen) nuclear reactions of Uranium-235 preceded human existence. Radioactive products that were produced that have since decayed, but this would not be the last of Uranium-235’s instability. 
The most energetic Uranium-235s of all have recently become entangled with neutrons flying through space at impressively fast trajectories and even higher temperatures relinquishing its desire to remain Uranium-235, its proton splits in half—what we call fission.

Control of the … dynamics and thermodynamics.
But energy is not the sole byproduct! Neutron collisions overcome Uranium’s will to remain stable, creating Plutonium-239, which responds to new neutrons through nondeterministic reactions whose outcomes can only be known in probabilistic terms. Plutonium willing to retain neutrons becomes Plutonium-240, then becoming Plutonium-241, transmuted from Plutonium-239 yet also excessively volatile, ready to burst forth into energy upon the collision of one last fateful neutron…

After jettisoning its radioactive objects, plutonium refuses to completely dissolve into energy. Wrestling with the spectre of plutonium, policymakers have ambivalently explored options of reprocessing, temporary shortage, and even the burial of permanent casks.

PG: I’ve been thinking …  thousand or a million. 
But the genie will not go back into the bottle—Plutonium floats through time and space, inhaled through human lungs and permeating the blood stream, then being deposited in the skeleton where it dwells for decades. But plutonium is more than one kind of thing, and these so-called isotope are labeled by referring to the number of neutrons in the atom.  Decaying Plutonium-239s emit alpha particles, consisting of two protons and two neutrons bound by the doppelganger of a seemingly benign helium nuclei. Decaying Plutonium-241s emit beta particles: positrons gliding faster than its alpha siblings. 
Nuclear decay occurs through the action of weak nuclear forces, one of the four irreducible forces in the universe as we know it. A neutron decays into a proton by splitting in half, giving up an electron while retaining the proton remainder. 
Plutonium is a HYPEROBJECT defying the size and time constraints of human perception. Human eyes cannot see a Plutonium atom decaying, and what we think we know is seen through a microscope darkly—Responding to plutonium’s action requires reckoning with inefficacy of purely human thought.

We expect the federal government to respond. Plutonium places an ambivalent demand on federal energy policy, as a blessing and curse, as a proliferation threat and solution for energy security. Federal incentives for nuclear power are inevitable.

Plutonium’s demand for nuclear energy is received by a diverse network of agents, governmental and nongovernmental, human and nonhuman. Decision emerge through open-ended processes involving nuclear materials as proper agents of action.

Plutonium, nuclear power, and the flows of electricity it emits all have radical influence on federal energy policy—these reactions affect our engagement with the resolution.

We affirm the expectation of nuclear power incentives as a response to plutonium’s demands for a new energy policy. The does not resolve the political, but instead cultivates the capacity to respond.

Energy production is the outcome of affective flows stimulating human and nonhuman objects alike. Enchantment with otherwise inert matter vitalizes federal energy policy.
