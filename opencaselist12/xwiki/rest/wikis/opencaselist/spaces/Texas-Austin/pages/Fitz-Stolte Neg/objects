Civil society is founded upon the murder of Black and Red bodies.

What are we to make .... films in parts 2, 3, and 4.

The affirmative’s hope in continuous renewable energy production epitomizes fantasy of whiteness as it cannot account for the irreparable loss that defines blackness. Only an ecomelancholia can approach the earth as a site of black memory.

As if long awaiting a sympathetic listener, the… rectification while destruction occurs unabated.
AND In these early works, Clifton began to articulate an environmental…. is one all life all death all one (43)

The affirmative’s anchor within a regime of energy production and a democratization of work assumes a Gramscian struggle for hegemony. The slave, positioned as a recipient of direct force and terror, demands an end to production and the entire coherence of civil society.

Any serious consideration of the question… a progressively expanding civil society as well.
AND Capital was kick-started by the …. c onstituent element: black accumulation and death.
AND Conclusion Civil society is the terrain where hegemony is produced…. wings — the understudy of Gramsci’s hegemony.

White supremacy is a global modality of genocidal violence—slavery may have ended in name, but its operational logic continues to fester. Reformist measures simply fuel the unending violence of antiblackness.

To crystallize what I hope to be the potentially…. overwhelming consent of white/multiculturalist civil society.

The alternative is to engage in an unflinching paradigmatic analysis of antiblackness.
The power to post the question is the greater power of all. Political ontology is a scandal which cannot and will not account for the gratuitous violence of slavery. Only the alternative engages in the call for total abolition.

We take inspiration from Jones’s description –  Not: 
themes  nor straightforwardly...previously gone unrecognized
She continues in 2011:
Jones 2011 Emma, Dr Phil at U Oregon, SPEAKING AT THE LIMIT: THE ONTOLOGY OF LUCE IRIGARAY’S ETHICS, IN DIALOGUE WITH LACAN AND HEIDEGGER
Irigaray’s texts, according ... two different subjects” (JLI: 3). 

4 Points of method.
METHOD POINT ONE: “asks not what discourses say but what they do, not as bodies of truth, but as institutionally produced and supervised practices”  That’s Jones 2000

METHOD POINT TWO: Inconsistencies are a DOUBLE EDGED SWORD.
Writing in the context of feminism, Jones notes: , “contradiction, tension and instability sustain phallocentric accounts.’

Undoing dominant paradigms is thus not a blanket celebration of inconsistency.
Rather, Jones says we must: “mobilize instabilities” that have “become productive, rather than celebrated for its own sake”
…
intervening in the history of philosophy so as to “open it up to its own lacks and inadequacies, not as a source of weakness, but as a site for its growth and development”
She continues in 2000… 
 Rachel, Phil at U Dundee, Hypatia 15.2: 151-158
Blindspots and elisions,... French women philosophers.

METHOD POINT THREE: Does the 1AC reckon with its inconsistencies?—AKA, the links… 

They inscribe subjective divides into the heart of their politics, by creating a background upon which they operate upon by IGNORING OBJECTS

Bryant 10 Levi, Professor of Philosophy at Collin College, Hominind Ecology, http://larvalsubjects.wordpress.com/2012/05/10/hominid-ecology/#more-6121

From this moment forward…time to begin changing that.

But this imperative is lost amidst their BIG STICK impact calculus.
Perhaps the concrete political struggles of plan recipients are not enough to justify the 1AC?
Martin Leet writes: 

But the romantic ... work of politics?  
Leet continues in 2006 Senior Research at the Brisbane Institute; with Roland Bleiker “From the Sublime to the Subliminal: Fear, Awe and Wonder in International Politics” Millennium v 34
Thus, by means ... need for justification. 

METHOD POINT 4: Voting negative discerns the divisions within their project, welcoming the 1AC by setting aside its claims to solve its terminal impact.

Instead of judging them against an external standard, we test the 1AC against itself.

While a welcome...pogrom against animals. 
Too many people...in human form.&amp;#34; 

The 1AC promises redemption, repeating the sovereign decisiveness that founds the expulsion of the animal.
Vote negative to refuse the affirmative’s decision to be human.
This renunciation expresses the undecidability between the human and animal.
