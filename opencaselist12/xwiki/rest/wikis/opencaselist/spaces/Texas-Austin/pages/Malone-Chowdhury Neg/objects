So where do we stand now, in 2012? 2011 was the year of 
AND
to see, and enough obscurity for those who have a contrary disposition.&amp;#34;

====The transition to green capitalism embodied in the affirmative is a guise to mask the fundamental antagonisms of infinite accumulation and finite resources====

Of course, the question of the relationship between ~’ecology~’ and capitalism is not

between the infinite accumulation of capital, and life on a finite planet.

====Critique must recognize the dialectical relationship between pedagogy and practice—their method abandons actual political struggle.====

At this ferociously ambivalent juncture in world history, with the flames of finance neoliberalism 
AND
the public scholar and educator. It is Marx~’s form of revolutionary praxis.


====We have an a-priori ethical obligation to reject capitalism. There may be some things worse than death, but you will never know because capitalism makes its victims anonymous.====

Zizek and Daly 2004
Slavoj and Glyn, Conversations with Zizek, page 14-16

For Zizek it is imperative that we cut through this Gordian knot of postmodern protocol

Capitalism has not changed its spots. It is still based on the exploitation of

====The alternative is to endorse egalitarian terror.====


====Contemporary politics-as-such has become impotent and evacuated of emancipatory potential. The task is precisely to be less democratic and unleash a ruthless dialectical violence against the totality of global capitalism.====

The 1AC maps a linear path from A to B to C to D, paving over the complex interactions between their dozens of predictions—But THE WHOLE IS MORE THAN THE SUM OF ITS PARTS

Concept 4: Nonlinearity5 ‘... the darkest corner of science is the realm

necessary to incorporate an acceptance of the inherent levels of uncertainty into planning. 

Impact—Existential risk is systemic, not a flash of instability to be predicted and controlled. The 1AC brackets the full complexity of crisis and the value questions behind their scenarios—Preventing the ADAPTATION and RESILIENCE necessary for a viable future.

4. Preliminary state of the art on resilience In contrast to the conventional risk 
AND
inherent, going beyond the lack of knowledge and encompassing ambiguity and ignorance.


Instead of weighing plan in a vacuum, reflect on the 1AC as a Flow of Communication–Meaning Emerges through Interactive Processes of knowledge and value.
Voting negative imagines energy policy-making that can adapt to the complex uncertainties paved over by the 1AC.


Their reductionist framework backfires, undermining political responsibility in the face of threat.

Despite movements towards more dialogic and rhetorical models, the field of risk communication remains

constitute not only risks, but also those who take and bear risks.
