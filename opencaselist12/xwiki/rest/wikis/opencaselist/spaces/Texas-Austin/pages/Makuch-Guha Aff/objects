Mainstream environmental organizations and activism is dominated by experts with racial, economic, and gender privilege.

Overcoming this exclusive form of political organizing requires decentralized grassroots energy movements focused on forming interconnections within and between local communities.

Our conclusions in the previous section are consistent with the emerging consensus in the modern

Shifting the scale for energy siting to the local fosters grassroots movements against environmental injustice that have been historically successful. Locating energy activism at the community level undermines elite control by shifting towards everyday experience as a locus for organization.

And, The scale of impact calculus comes first.

Systemic injustice persists through an elite scale of impact calculus that trivializes structural violence and over codes local struggles with global threats.

The advantage is centralized injustice
First, centralized solar power is inevitable and increasing
Jackson 12 Rob, works on the National Generation and Utilities Initiative at TRC Companies, “Outlook Bright for Future of Solar Energy”, June 29
The global solar energy market has grown to a record $257 billion according to 
AND
energy demand by 2030, up from 0.4 percent in 1990.

Mainstream environmental organizations and activism is dominated by experts with racial, economic, and gender privilege. This results in violent environmental injustice against disenfranchised populations. Overcoming this exclusive form of political organizing requires decentralized grassroots energy movements focused on forming interconnections within and between local communities. 
Faber and McCarthy 1 Daniel, Department of Sociology and Anthropology Northeastern University, and Deborah, Department of Sociology and Anthropology, College of Charleston, “The Evolving Structure of the Environmental Justice Movement in the United States: New Models for Democratic Decision-Making”, Social Justice Research, Vol. 14, No. 4, December 2001

AND
American businesses are adopting strategies with respect to the disposal of toxic wastes,
exploitation of mineral wealth, and pollution abatement which are not only the most economically

recycling plant, and location of a power plant (Bullard, 2000).


Minority and low-income communities experience disproportionate pollution resulting from centralized energy siting practices. Decentralized solar energy challenges this structure of ongoing violence.

C. Reduce Pollution Burden of Environmental Justice Communities A policy encouraging renewable energy development 
AND
to encourage energy efficiency upgrades, but that is not explored further here. 


Environmental injustice outweighs any impact on probability and magnitude – risk assessment is epistemologically biased towards white male elites who discount the severity of localized environmental hazards in destroying marginalized communities.

dual approaches that combine science and experience will fall short if the appeal to experience

, and to remain committed to broad and open dialogue with the community.



This system of environmental injustice creates disposable populations and threatens an emerging apocalypse that demands challenging short term catastrophe focus - visible violence develops from subterranean structures of inequity
Nixon ‘9 Rob, Professor of English at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, “NEOLIBERALISM, SLOW VIOLENCE, AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL PICARESQUE”, MFS Modern Fiction Studies, Volume 55 number 3, Fall 2009, http://sustainabilityparadox.commons.gc.cuny.edu/files/2010/09/Nixon-Neoliberalism2.pdf   
The picaresque proves uncannily effective at dramatizing another critical dimension to the environmentalism of the

And, Focus on underlying structures producing violence outweighs a one shot linear cause for conflict

John Paul Lederach, drawing on Wheatley, has found the notion of ―process
AND

Uncertainty and nonlinearity are inevitable due to inherent complexity within systems

Concept 4: Nonlinearity5 ‘... the darkest corner of science is the realm 
…… ‘fallen under the enchantment of delivering clear, specific, measurable outcomes’ (Westley et al., 2006).



Not all predictive policymaking is impossible – energy decision-making at the local scale resolves our complexity theory arguments because it facilitates a constantly shifting form of organization that is adaptive to unpredictability and foments movements against injustice
Gilchrist 2k Alison, BA and MS, Regional Links Manager (England) for the Community Develop- ment Foundation, advising the emerging regional authorities on their strat- egies for community involvement in a variety of government funding programmes and policy initiatives, “The well-connected community: networking to the edge of chaos”, COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT JOURNAL VOL. 35 NO. 3 July 2000 pp. 264–275
Organizational studies suggest that network forms of organization provide the most effective means of coping 
AND
disconnect people from the rest of society. As the recent PAT 9 Report 
 (SEU, 1999) recognized, informal networks provide a crucial foundation for community 
AND
of contemporary or contested values of social justice. Oppression, prejudice and social 
exclusion hinder and distort communication of information across the system and constrain potentially advantageous collaborative 
AND
participation in community activities and the strength- ening of local democratic processes.


Next contention is political scale - 
The federal government should remove restrictions that states impose on localities for solar siting – this is crucial to avoid states’ usurping of decentralized energy production. Shifting the scale of energy decision-making to localities empowers communities to create social movements for sustainable energy.
Pursley and Wiseman 11 Garrick, Assistant Professor of Law, University of Toledo College of Law, and Hannah, Assistant Professor of Law, University of Tulsa College of Law, “Local Energy”, Emory Law Journal, 60 Emory L.J. 877
Our conclusions in the previous section are consistent with the emerging consensus in the modern

proposed cooperative regulatory scheme. *936 1. Local Institutional Advantages The

Congress&amp;#39;s affirmative legislative powers under the modern, expansive interpretation of the Commerce Clause. 
AND
much will emerge. Indeed, for a prosperous future, it must.



Community solar energy and microgrids are prohibited by the states now – the aff solves and enables small scale cost sharing
Bronin 10 Sara, Associate Professor of Law, University of Connecticut, “Curbing Energy Sprawl with Microgrids”, 43 Conn. L. Rev. 547
With demand for energy showing no signs of abating, slowing energy sprawl will require 
AND
uniform approach to microgrids would be part of a multi-faceted solution.


Shifting the scale for energy siting to the local fosters grassroots movements against environmental injustice that have been historically successful. Locating energy activism at the community level undermines elite control by shifting towards everyday experience as a locus for organization.
Towers 2k George, PhD and professor of human geography at Concord University, “Applying the Political Geography of Scale: Grassroots Strategies and Environmental Justice*”, Professional Geographer, 52(1) 2000, pages 23–36
T he grassroots environmental movement is defined by geographical scale. The thou- sands 
AND

dollars for their cause, able to defeat one of the country’s biggest corporations?

Secondly, focusing on the scale of route in- creased organizational motivation. Instead

Locating solar energy siting decision-making at the scale of communities is crucial for energy justice – it spurs fundamental social change in spite of complexity

Orienting energy siting decisions around the local scale opens up political decision-making to gendered knowledge and experiences usually isolated to the domestic sphere – that’s crucial to social mobilization against injustice
Abbruzzese and Wekerle 11 Teresa V. Abbruzzese is a PhD candidate in the 
AND

Women are often at the forefront of place-based struggles against development and sprawl

Decentralized solar energy policy reorients decision-making to increase gender equality
Lambrou and Piana 6 Yianna, Senior Officer in the Gender, Equity and Rural Employment Division of the Economic and Social Development Department at FAO, and Grazia, “ENERGY AND GENDER ISSUES IN RURAL SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT”, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations
Government actions are needed at both the national and the local level to remove the 
AND
for women’s empowerment, thus facilitating progress towards the goal of gender equality.

And, The scale of impact calculus comes first.
Systemic injustice persists through an elite scale of impact calculus that trivializes structural violence and over codes local struggles with global threats. Challenging this system requires your decision start from the scale of localized exclusions not top-down managerialism – the way the politics of energy is FRAMED is key
McCan 3 Eugene, Professor of Geography – Ohio State University, “FRAMING SPACE AND TIME IN THE CITY: URBAN POLICY AND THE POLITICS OF SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL SCALE” JOURNAL OF URBAN AFFAIRS, Volume 25, Number 2, pages 159–178
