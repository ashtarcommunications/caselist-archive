We are Told Societies evolve
We are Told Communities Naturally Spring forth from Unreason to Rationally Form Nation-States
We are Told that we are “in the United States;”
That we are a definitive Country;
That we defined by our Borders;
That we possess a culture of rallying around our multicultural flag sitting atop a shining city on the hill. We are told to ask Ourselves not ‘what our country can do for us but rather what we can do for our country.”
 
Unfortunately we are told a lie; 
We have been doused in the embalming fluids of fashionable theories of a ‘Progressive History,’ whose great tides inevitably scale upwards from the Individual to the Nation. 
But the truth is that we have never been modern.

The “Nation’s” Signature is Forged Upon the Backs of Countless Peoples – Yet this Identity Remains to be Seen as Anything More than a Comforting Fiction – a Fiction to Fill our Wounds and Instill a Sense of Wholeness; Unfortunately this trope of National Unity is Always Already Wanton – Nothing more than a Therapeutic Story We Replay to Get Through the Day; A Crutch to Avoid the Nagging and Necessary but Ultimately Deferred Confrontations with the Violent Constitution of Identity, Race, and Nationality. 

Howard Winant Likewise Contends that  “It is clear, therefore, that any analytics of race in the United States must be based on an understanding of the juridical structures of the nation-state through which the system of racial hierarchy is consolidated. 

 
Santana Pinho of Brazil Further Details the ways in which U.S. culture is built upon “a liberal model of multiculturalism in which the idea of diversity is inert” because American Society has established “canned and commercialized identities” of racialized groups. And that “The U.S. classification of “lineages as ethnicities” serves the purpose of maintaining the current ethnic boundaries.” 
It’s Precisely within this Aura of the Multiculturalism that the Matrices of Racial Contradictions Persist Unaddressed not only domestically but Globally. “The United States has dictated to the rest of the world its own multiculturalist policies.”  
Moreover, “the explicit or implicit comparison to U.S. American society, which is almost always accompanied by a privileging of the U.S. American way of dealing with race. 
The Centering of U.S. Models of Race Polarizes Analyses of Racism into “two distinct antagonistic and exclusionary discourses”composed of the “Essenitalist Discourses” of Black Movements which remains “framed mostly by its deference to American blacks,” on the one hand and “the academic discourse, predominantly anti-essentialist,” on the other hand. 

This Oppositional Division has Produced an Impasse that Neither Resolves the Difficult Questions of Which is Correct nor Challenges the  Reigning Assumptions that the U.S. is the Ultimate Authority on Questions Concerning Race.

These Exceptionalist Tendencies are Reflected in Policy and Academic Communities alike, Wherein American Race Theorists Enjoy a Particularly Privileged Position Remaining Seemingly Absolved from Ethical Complicity while nonetheless Massively Investing in a Re-Centering of the American Project
Santana Pinho Offers a Particularly Illuminating Account of this Dynamic in which “The predominance of Eurocentric or US-centric perspectives in the social sciences has strengthened the notion that there is an exclusive model of modernity, experienced firstly in the…U.S.A. as the most ‘modern within the African Diaspora.’”“The notion that the black experience in the United States” is the ultimate guide to Understandings of Anti-Black Racisms “is endorsed by the theoretical formulations” Of Contemporary Scholars of Blackness in the U.S. and Beyond. “The abundance of material and intellectual resources in the U.S. academy…and hegemony of its ideas … Coupled with that is the position of each country in the global configuration of power, which has a decisive effect on the expansion and distribution of ideas and theories.

There is an Irrefutable Link Between the Construction of National Identity and the formation of Racial Relations – The Two are Intertwined as Santana Pinho Explains:  The proliferation and politicization of identities do not merely reflect moral or political choices, but a complex historical production that has constructed most of us as marginal, deviant or sub-humans. The very production of some identities as marginal is itself constitutive of the centrality and legitimacy of the center…political identity is produced not only through these categories, but as these categories… the regulatory demands of the state encourage the formation of political identities founded on injury, thereby stimulating marginalized categories while reinforcing the bourgeois masculinist ideal of equality that has at its center the white heterosexual male. 

Under a Liberal Model of State-Based Racial Formations Peripheral Populations “will be competing for the crumbs that fall from the table of the center of power.  The Deference to the U.S. Remains Problematic for Theorizations of Race Relations because it“centralizes some experiences while marginalizing others… Therefore they run the risk of transforming into colonialist or even fascist projects since the belief in an exclusive center makes possible dominance and control. 

Pinho argues however, “The solution to avoid totalitarianism is to defend a variety of paradigms and to remain open to the creation of new theories that take into account historical inequalities through radical analyses of power relations. For such, it is necessary to get rid of the superficiality and Manichaeism that often reign. 
One Means of Accomplishing a Decentering of the U.S. is to Adopt a “perspective that theorizes blackness in its many and varied versions, rejecting the notion that there is an exclusive –or more advanced-formula of blackness. 
The Necssity for Such an Approach is Provided by an Understanding of the Diaspora as “characterized by the existence of several radiating centers of symbols, objects, ideas and theories. If our theories succeed to go beyond unicentrality, our studies will make possible the replacement of hierarchical relations with more balanced dialogues
 
Our Community remains steadfast and resolute in its Commitment to Centering its Politics Solely within the Confines of the United States. This Habitual Tendency is Especially True with Regard to Questions of Energy Production. A History of Resolutions on Energy Topics is Indicative of our Debate Community’s Fascination with Own its Reflection; with its Narcissistic Fetish with the U.S. 
Take, For Example, “Resolved: &amp;#34;That the federal government should adopt an energy policy that substantially reduces nonmilitary consumption of fossil fuels in the United States.&amp;#34;
Or the Waste Topic, “Resolved: &amp;#34;That any and all injury resulting from the disposal of hazardous waste in the United States should be the legal responsibility of the producer of that waste.&amp;#34;
Or another Energy Topic, “Resolved: That the United States Federal Government should establish an energy policy requiring a substantial reduction in the consumption in the total non-governmental consumption of fossil fuels in the United States.”

And Finally, This Year’s Topic, Which Marks one more Manifestation of American Academic Self-Indulgence: “Resolved: The United States Federal Government should substantially reduce restrictions on and/or substantially increase financial incentives for energy production in the United States of one or more of the following: coal, crude oil, natural gas, nuclear power, solar power, wind power.”

Yet, Beyond Conventional Interpretations of the topic lays the Mimetic Ruse of American Exceptionalism. Nuclear Power is defined multiply; the New Oxford American dictionary defines Nuclear Power as both the ‘Power generated by a nuclear reactor’ and as ‘a country that has nuclear weapons.’ 

 
The Atomic Age’s Most Potent Fission Remains the Split of Nuclearity, an Ambivalent Object Which Offers Recognition and Anti-Black Racism Simultaneously.  As Gabrielle Hecht Notes, “Unresolvable tensions between technopolitical exceptionalism and economic banality reverberate through the history of uranium, as it oscillated between apocalypse…and tradeable commodity”
…continued…
These questions are matters of ontology, questions about the things and categories of things that exist. Historical actors often deployed an ontology that appeared fixed, incontrovertible, and transparently empirical, in which essential qualities rigidly separated the nuclear from the non-nuclear Scholars have generally left this assumption unchallenged”
The Ambiguities Surrounding the fall-out of the Racialization of Technology Fragments any Singular Narration of the History of the Production of Nuclear Power. The “Parameters” of “Nuclearity,”are not Neutral but “depend on history and geography, science and technology, bodies and politics, radiation and race.” 

Suddenly, the Unnoticed Significance of Confining the Topic to ‘in the United States’ Takes on a New Importance. The Split Meanings Embodied by the Resolution’s Mundane Use of Nuclear Power “is not a straightforward act of classification. Ambivalence and ambiguity… are structural features of nuclear technologies.” There is a Parallel Power Relation in The Erasure of the Racialized Violence in the Constitution of Nuclear Things and Nuclear Nations. ’

As Gabrielle Hecht Contends “Agreements and disagreements about degrees of nuclearity have significant consequences. They structure global control over the flow of radioactive materials. They constitute the conceptual bedrock of anti-nuclear movements and nuclear power industries. They affect regulatory frameworks … And sometimes they send nations off to war. The ambiguities underlying recent struggles over the nuclear state of the world are too important to be dismissed as mere political wrangling. They are part of the &amp;#34;nuclear age.&amp;#34;”

We Must Confront the Ways in Which nuclear technologies define a phase of human history.. Our fetishes keep us close to bombs and reactors and far from Largely because of our mooring in time and space, we haven&amp;#39;t known how to view these ambiguities other places where nuclearity gets made and unmade. We have become complacent and complicit in the equation between nuclearity and &amp;#34;development.&amp;#34;

  In the Aura of the Immigrant State, the birthplace of democracy, and all things definitively different persist a perverse disavowal, a refusal, and an ethical failure to engage the fundamentally contradictory basis of ‘civil society.’ 

As Lewis Gordon Forcefully Contends: 
Philosophy of culture involves the complexity of integrating at least two notions that may at first not seem compatible—namely, reason and culture. The latter, as is well known, is often governed by myth, aspirations, and the constellation of relations that facilitate a world…at home, whereas the former is governed by a commitment to reality and truth often with a consequence of displacement and realized contradictions…. “Commitment however is not identical with the realization of that to which it is made. One of the paradoxical and ironic dimensions of reason…is the ability to synthesize the anomalous and even what at first may offer itself more aggressively as antinomy.

The Result of this Contradictory Engagement is the Production of an Uncanny World – 
A World without Redemption
A World of Nations Haunted by the Night of Black Tomorrow
A World that requires of us all a “radical thought,” not only in its historical political specificity but also in the sense of thought devoted to getting to the roots of phenomena and to a level of self-critique that includes subjecting the method of self-critique itself to inquiry. 
In Short, A World that Requires of Us A Challenge to the Centering of the U.S., to the World as We Know it, and to the Future Defined by the Past.

 
Refusing the Hegemony of the American Academic in favor of  “diaspora is still utterly necessary for uncovering the ethical and political dynamics of the unfinished history of blacks.”

Santana Pinho Argues that, “Black particularity should be recognized and valued in any analysis of black identities because it is defined by cultural practices and political agendas that connect otherwise dispersed blacks. Thus, attempts to locate cultural practices that unite blacks scattered around the New World, Europe and Africa should not be considered cheap essentialism

However, “To value these connections, however, should not mean that identity politics should be the same for all blacks from different countries, or even within the same country. If it is already problematic to think of a common past for all blacks in the diaspora, it is even more complicated to believe that the future will be resolved everywhere in the same manner…The U.S. American black movements...encounter great difficulties, and above all, they are situated within a very distinct context from the socio-racial reality…of black identities in the diaspora who carry an important transnational dimension,”

Santana Pinho Offers an Alternative to “unicentralist theories,” by describing the ways  “that the black diaspora, instead of being centered around …the United States as an exporting center of models of ethnicity, has several centers spread around the black Atlantic. 
Pinho’s Methodology “maps out a multicentered black diaspora “ by “Providing alternative to the metaphysical idea of a “ race” that determines the culture “as if it were “inscribed in the body. 
This, “alternative and liberating manner of understanding the “ diaspora,” conceived as something dynamic that allows for the emergence of counter-powers that have challenged territorial sovereignties and beliefs in absolute identities. Understood in such way, the concept of diaspora allows us to go beyond geography and genealogy, beyond nature and culture, because it rejects the belief in spontaneously-generated nationalities and racialities. 
Furthermore by Conceiving the “diaspora in its dynamic meanings of a network of multiplicity, communication, and interaction, black identities can become explicitly contrary to nationalistic thought or to ideas that invoke a single emanating center of blackness, authenticity, and truth.
The Notion of a Dynamic Diaspora rejects the reduction of blackness to mere ethnic or national traditions, thus combating both the paradigms of “ethnic absolutisms” and the centrality of the discourses produced in the U.S….). While previously imagined as being delimited by national boundaries, collective identities have multiplied and expanded (or have had their expansion recognized) as beyond the limits of nations. Black diasporic connections are, in my view, an undeniable example of this transnational expansion.
Gabrielle Hecht Places The Injunction to Move Critiques Beyond the Restriction of Radioactive Racism to the Confines of the Nation State in Arguing that “Understanding the transnational networks that shape the power of technology in the contemporary world is a complex and difficult proposition,” But a Necessary Proposition Nonetheless. 

The Tracing of the Resolution’s Fragmented Histories  Requires moving beyond the “always partial” “view from above” because it “runs the risk of deceiving us into thinking that some places don’t matter enough to deserve our attention. This is a dangerous illusion.” 
Instead, “We must land in unfamiliar places and study them on their own terms. The result is necessarily a fractured history. The fault lines between these multiple narratives gape because transnational history is not smooth and seamless, but uneven and disjointed. As shifting signifiers, nuclearity and markets run through these histories; their meanings are shaped by place, but not always in the same way.
