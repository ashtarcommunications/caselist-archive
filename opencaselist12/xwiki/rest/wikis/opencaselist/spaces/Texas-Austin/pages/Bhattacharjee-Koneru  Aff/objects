Recognizing nuclear power as a potential benefit to Department of Defense (DoD) facilities, Congress directed the DoD, in section 2845 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) of 2010, to “conduct a study to assess the feasibility of developing nuclear power plants on military installations” 12. Specifically, the study is to consider the following topics:
• Options for construction and operation
• Cost estimates and the potential for life-cycle cost savings
• Potential energy security advantages
• Additional infrastructure costs
• Effect on the quality of life of military personnel
• Regulatory, state, and local concerns
• Effect on operations on military installations
• Potential environmental liabilities
• Factors that may impact safe colocation of nuclear power plants on military installations
• Other factors that bear on the feasibility of developing nuclear power plants on military installations.
To meet this requirement, the office of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Installations and Environment, DUSD(IandE), asked CNA to conduct this feasibility study. The CNA effort was directed by a steering group consisting of representatives from DUSD (IandE), each of the military departments, DOE, NRC, and DOE Labs. This report documents our analysis and findings.

We acknowledge that there are many uncertainties and risks associated with these reactors. On the other hand, failing to pursue these technologies raises its own set of risks for DOD, which we review in this section: first, small reactors may fail to be commercialized

DoD empirically does not implement energy policy recommendations
DSB 8
Defense Science Board Task Force on DoD Energy Strategy, Feb 2008, More Figh -Less Fuel, www.acq.osd.mil/dsb/reports/ADA477619.pdf 

Finding #1: The recommendations from the 2001 Defense Science Board Task Force Report “More Capable Warfighting Through Reduced Fuel Burden” have not been implemented.
The principal finding of the 2001 DSB report was that DoD systematically underestimates the cost 
AND
so the PPBES process cannot not provide it visibility when considering investment decisions.
These findings remain valid today. Few of the recommendations of that study have been implemented to date. Those that have begun; making energy efficiency a selective Key Performance Parameter in system design, and using the fully burdened cost of fuel in life cycle costing of alternative systems; are in their early stages of implementation. Focused leadership will be required to complete the recommendations of the 2001 study and similar recommendations made herein.

Immigration not passing now – labor problems
Politico, 3/22/13, “Immigration deal in limbo as busin3ess, labor clash” http://www.politico.com/story/2013/03/immigration-deal-senate-close-89221.html#ixzz2Ot8RFSgj
The Senate’s “Gang of Eight” is preparing to leave town with a deal on immigration reform in limbo, stalled by a fight between Big Labor and Big Business.
On Thursday morning, it had appeared that a deal was in hand over the major remaining sticking point: the outlines of a broad new visa program aimed at balancing the need for foreign workers in low-skilled jobs with the desires of American workers competing for those same jobs.
So much for optimism.
In a closed-door session that stretched late into Thursday night, things got heated. Sources said negotiations grew extremely tense after business groups balked. There were more talks on Friday — but no more progress, even though negotiations continued in a rare Friday night session of the Senate.
Now, the Gang of Eight faces a quandary. If senators can’t win the endorsement of labor and business, they must soon decide whether to go their own way — absent the support of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and AFL-CIO — and hope the powerful interest groups stay neutral when a bill eventually emerges.
The senators said they would continue to negotiate with the interest groups during their two-week recess, with the goal of narrowing their differences, winning their backing and rolling out a proposal in the second week of April. That would set up a Senate Judiciary Committee vote before the end of the month, with floor votes by early summer.
“People have a lot at stake here,” said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.). “This is a huge deal. Talking about the lives of 11 million people just to start with, so I understand why passions are high, and sentiments are high.&amp;#34;
Late Friday night, tensions were still at a boil. Labor officials accused Republicans and business groups of proposing “congressionally sanctioned poverty” for low-skilled workers. And Chamber officials attacked labor groups for preventing a deal from taking shape.
“The unions have jeopardized the entire immigration reform effort, which would provide a pathway to legalization and citizenship for the 10-11 million undocumented workers, because of their refusal to take a responsible stance on a small temporary worker program,” Randy Johnson, the Chamber’s senior vice president of Labor, Immigration, and Employee Benefits, said in a late Friday night statement. “These types of programs have always been considered a key part of comprehensive immigration reform.”

Won’t pass in the House
Latino Post, 3/27/13, “Immigration Reform News 2013: House Steps Up With Bill More Pleasing to Republicans As Senate Hits Snags” http://www.latinospost.com/articles/15405/20130327/immigration-reform-news-2013-house-steps-up-bill-more-pleasing.htm

&amp;#34;You know, just kind of the sensitivity is, would House Republicans be open to a bill that comes from a Democratic-controlled Senate or from a Democratic president? And that&amp;#39;s why we kind of think our effort is most important because if we can get one through the House, then I think the odds of getting it signed into law improve a lot,&amp;#34; he said.
Yarmuth said the group has been able to resolve the most difficult issues and is getting close to unveiling its own proposals, but he did not give any specifics. It seems unlikely that a bill that would garner the support of Tea Party Republicans would include enough provisions to make it acceptable to Democrats.

**Won’t pass – guest worker controversy will derail it – empirics prove
Washington Examiner, 3/24/13, “Op-ed: Guest-worker issue threatens immigration reform” http://washingtonexaminer.com/op-ed-guest-worker-issue-threatens-immigration-reform/article/2525252

Our skepticism was vindicated when AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka conceded to ABC earlier this month that they hadn&amp;#39;t yet reached a deal with the Chamber.
Neither the Chamber nor the unions have any problem with legalizing illegal immigrants. The 
AND
that it is very hard to organize and collect dues from temporary workers.
Reports last Friday indicated that talks between Big Labor and Big Business were at an impasse. Why does all this matter? Because this same issue helped torpedo Congress&amp;#39;s last attempt at comprehensive reform back in 2007.
At that time, Sens. Ted Kennedy and John McCain led a fragile coalition 
AND
out, and in doing so deprived the bill of crucial GOP support.
The Chamber and top labor leaders have been holding private talks this time around in 
AND
a guest-worker program, as far as Big Business is concerned.
Both sides are now leaking the details of the negotiations and spinning them furiously in the hopes of pre-emptively dodging blame for failure ~-~- a sure sign that talks are breaking down. Still, there is a lot of pressure on both sides to reach a compromise. Something may yet be hashed out.

Immigration draws forceful responses from both sides of the aisle, and the issue is sure to spark contentious debate as battle lines take shape. While immigration players such as Rep. Luis Guiterrez (D-Illinois) and Sen. Bob Menendez (D-New Jersey) support a path to citizenship for undocumented workers in the country, others, such as Republican Marco Rubio of Florida, do not.
Hammering out a bill that will have the approval of enough Republicans and Democrats is going to take compromise. While the last Congress was somewhat infamous for its seeming inability to do that - lawmakers failed to reach a fiscal cliff deal until the very last minute - this new batch of representatives and senators, which includes more Latinos than ever before, has a chance with immigration to prove it can facilitate real change.
