Issues only cost pc after they pass—also answers thumpers 
**Issues only cost capital once they reach the finish line.**
Drum, 3/10/2010 (Kevin – political blogger for Mother Jones, Immigration coming off the back burner?, Mother Jones, p. http://motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2010/03/immigration-coming-back-burner)
Not to pick on Ezra or anything, but this attitude betrays a surprisingly common misconception about political issues in general. The fact is that political dogs never bark until an issue becomes an active one. Opposition to Social Security privatization was pretty mild until 2005, when George Bush turned it into an active issue. Opposition to healthcare reform was mild until 2009, when Barack Obama turned it into an active issue. Etc.  I only bring this up because we often take a look at polls and think they tell us what the public thinks about something. But for the most part, they don&amp;#39;t.1 That is, they don&amp;#39;t until the issue in question is squarely on the table and both sides have spent a couple of months filling the airwaves with their best agitprop. Polling data about gays in the military, for example, hasn&amp;#39;t changed a lot over the past year or two, but once Congress takes up the issue in earnest and the Focus on the Family newsletters go out, the push polling starts, Rush Limbaugh picks it up, and Fox News creates an incendiary graphic to go with its saturation coverage — well, that&amp;#39;s when the polling will tell you something. And it will probably tell you something different from what it tells you now.  Immigration was bubbling along as sort of a background issue during the Bush administration too until 2007, when he tried to move an actual bill. Then all hell broke loose. The same thing will happen this time, and without even a John McCain to act as a conservative point man for a moderate solution. The political environment is worse now than it was in 2007, and I&amp;#39;ll be very surprised if it&amp;#39;s possible to make any serious progress on immigration reform. &amp;#34;Love &amp;#39;em or hate &amp;#39;em,&amp;#34; says Ezra, illegal immigrants &amp;#34;aren&amp;#39;t at the forefront of people&amp;#39;s minds.&amp;#34; Maybe not. But they will be soon.

**IF Obama already supports means republicans will oppose the plan  because they oppose Obama energy policies **
**Certain GOP re-elections make it certain that the plan will be unpopular in Congress**
WSJ, 11/7/12, “House GOP Set to Keep Hammering Obama&amp;#39;s Energy Plans” http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324439804578105750819599878.html?mod=googlenews_wsj
WASHINGTON—The loudest critics of President Barack Obama&amp;#39;s energy policies were re-elected to Congress on Tuesday, teeing up two more years of battles over signature Republican issues such as U.S. oil production and environmental regulation.
Two powerful House Republican chairmen—Rep. Fred Upton of the Energy and Commerce Committee and Rep. Doc Hastings of the Natural Resources Committee—both won re-election. Other Republican lawmakers who hold prominent roles on the energy committees, Reps. Ed Whitfield of Kentucky and John Shimkus of Illinois, also hung on to their seats.


==Gun Control ==
