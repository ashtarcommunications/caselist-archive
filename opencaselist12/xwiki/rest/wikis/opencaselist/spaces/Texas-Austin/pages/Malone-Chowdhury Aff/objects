Page 1 Production

The more we sense the less we know. From the sun to the cosmos, glancing off and being absorbed by the earth. This solar production cannot be known by humans but can surely be felt, thought, and imagined. Everything has gone blurry and any conception of production is ripped from our grasp. Nature is a horror novel gone awry—at least for us.

While the conventional leftist reading of Bataille would see this as a critique of global

flow of life) or the scientific (fluid dynamics, laminar flow).

Such horror is not impossible but improbable exposing the contingency humans as well as the sun that builds and destroys the complexity of its own systems. That doesn’t make the sun our cosmic interlocutor, but more like a hot mess. In this thermal and cosmological model a closed system is impossible—chaos always overwhelms stasis

The thermospasm is reality as undilute chaos. It is where we all came from

are only gradations and a multiplicitous delicacy of steps’ ~[N II 589~].

It’s less a question of what is this big ball of fire or what does our relation to the sun mean, only ask what egregious things and forces does it produce. Even our very thoughts are in part infiltrated and created by solar forces.

Land 93 Nick, University of Warwick, &amp;#34;Machinic Desire,&amp;#34; Textual Practice, Vol. 7 Is. 3 472-474

The philosophy of production becomes atheistic, orphan, and inhuman. In the technocosmos

energy. Production of the real as an intensive magnitude starting at zero.


Production is always middling—from the sun, to the earth, to the sun, to the rest of the cosmos all at once. The sun is our starting point, but then becomes only a small glimpse in the cosmos. We are terrifically lost pushed in and out simultaneously in what the sun produces and what terrestrial life and the sun are composed by and producing in. Only then like Icarus can we understand the precariousness of our position

Everything begins for us with the sun, because (we shall come to see

of a true end, which does not serve anything’ ~[VII 298~].

Disorder always increases in a closed system (such as the universe), because nature

but a scorch-mark from the expository diagnosis of the physicalistic prejudice.
 

The production of the sun makes the privileged scales or temporalities impossible due to irreducible details. The cosmos has a great surface of disparate objects and it seems as if there is no ideal perspective in the wake of the sun.

Page 2 Speculative conjunction

Speculate the United States federal government removes all restrictions for solar energy production in the United States

Speculation is necessary to investigate the production of thought itself which is embedded in nature. Our speculation eviscerates the comfort of interiority that papers over the most unsettling limits and trajectories of nature.

We greet solar production with melancholy not because it is intrinsically horrific, but it certainly is for the all-too-human world

Beyond a better articulation of becoming, a theory of relations is also required.

only started to understand what it means to be a part of it.

Horror emerges as that which can usurp all evaluations. But in a solar economy to usurp is also connective between traumas.

Our thoughts are produced by our ecological milieu, this indistiction makes dualist thought impossible. And although we can know the sun we are deeply affected by its seeming harshness.

We conjugate two processes both constituted by trauma: endogenic tension which is the universal made regional expressed by our shared horror and exogenic tension that that alter our capacity for reflexivity. These tension pull at our horror and experiences both regionally and universally through interconnected trauma
