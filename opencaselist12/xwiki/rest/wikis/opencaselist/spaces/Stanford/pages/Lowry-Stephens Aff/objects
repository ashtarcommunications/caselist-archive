The sexualization of nature at work here is mirrored by a narcissistic Western political subject, one that sees itself as objective, rational, and Enlightened, and thus entitled to mastery over nature. This model of subjectivity excludes all those it doesn’t see as identical to itself – women, people of color, queers, and indigenous peoples, to name but a few – and is instrumental to the colonization of the geopolitical and natural worlds.

What interests are those exactly? Well I’d say the ex-governor laid it out pretty well. It is for the sake of our national security and of course our economic prosperity. These two reigning goals of policy discourse find their roots in colonialism. The way of relating to Nature expressed through drill baby drill, expressed through this year’s topic, is highly compatible with a way of relating to the Foreign and the Other in terms of domination and competition. The sexualization of the Other is a frequent factor in its subordination to the hegemonic model of subjectivity. The kind of knowledge produced through topical discussion thus feeds into endless cycles of colonial violence. 

Gaard 1997 (Greta, “Toward a Queer Ecofeminism,” Hypatia, Volume 12, Issue 1, http://www.google.com/url?sa=tandrct=jandq=andesrc=sandsource=webandcd=1andved=0CCEQFjAAandurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lespantheresroses.org%2Ftextes%2Fecology_toward_a_queer_ecofeminism.pdfandei=HX-LULyVGOKi2wWvuIHoDgandusg=AFQjCNGQdIsjinIfasYcaZzkpcEyioG7ig

We as a community must do away with the notion that a single approach to the topic, or to affirmation, is necessary, or even desirable. Framework and topicality are rooted in a desire to affirm a common, unified vision of debate. Such a unified vision inevitably reflects the values of hegemonic power.

Moira Gatens, Professor of Philosophy at Academy of Social Sciences in Australia, Corporeal Representations in/and the Body Politic, Writing on the body: female embodiment and feminist theory, 1997, p. 85-87

This nomadic form of feminism seeks to restructure our relationship to the Other and to difference in a way that is not doomed to recreate violence.  It requires critique at every level, from the content of the topic to the rules of the discursive game.

Rosi Braidotti, Director of Center for the Humanities at Utrecht, Mothers, Monsters, and Machines, Writing on the body: female embodiment and feminist theory, Pg 75-76
