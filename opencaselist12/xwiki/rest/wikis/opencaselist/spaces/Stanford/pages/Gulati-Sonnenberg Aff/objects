II. CCS is Critical to a Zero-Carbon World¶ The title of a recent article by two leading climate researchers sums up the message emerging from the latest scientific evidence: &amp;#34;Stabilizing climate requires near-zero emissions.&amp;#34;1 Even the most dramatic, 50–80 percent CO2 reduction goals generally being discussed likely are not enough. We need a near-100-percent reduction by mid-century at the latest. Energy systems need to change faster.2¶ Part of the urgency stems from the reality that warming impacts from today~’s emissions may last as long as 1,000 years3; we cannot assume that reducing emissions &amp;#34;tomorrow&amp;#34; means we can reverse damage done to date. Worse, we risk passing irreversible &amp;#34;tipping points&amp;#34; that trigger abrupt and catastrophic changes, such as major ice melt in the polar regions, extensive rainforest loss, and radical alterations of critical weather and ocean circulation patterns. Such tipping points could be in sight if current emission trends continue for another decade or more.4¶ Unfortunately, we are moving in the wrong direction fast. In recent years, China has added coal capacity at a rate of one large new plant per week (70–100 GW per year)5 and India – potentially the world~’s most populous country by 2030 – could ramp up as well. The International Energy Agency (IEA) currently projects that world coal capacity will nearly double by 2030, an increase of 1,310 GW.6 If this build-out occurs without CCS, it will increase world CO2 emissions by about 12.6 billion metric tons annually7—roughly twice current U.S. emissions from all sources. Clearly, China, India, and other developing countries will &amp;#34;make or break&amp;#34; any global effort to cut CO2 emissions—in fact, changes in their emissions trajectory will overwhelm any plausible reductions by developed countries.¶ Numerous studies—including studies by the IEA, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the U.S. Climate Change Science Program (CCSP), and several major environmental organizations—have assessed the relative roles that different technologies might play in meeting various climate stabilization targets. This body of work (and more) suggests that CCS has economic advantages relative to other options and is likely to be indispensable in achieving a zero-carbon energy mix. Specifically, these studies (which are reviewed and summarized at the CATF Web site, http://www.catf.us/projects/power_sector/advanced_coal/) find the following:¶ • Stabilizing atmospheric CO2 at 450 parts per million by volume (ppmv) could require more than 250 GW of fossil power with CCS globally by 2030 (U.S. CCSP, 2007)8;¶ • Fossil fuels with CCS might need to provide 26 percent of global energy supply under stabilization constraints (WWF, 2007)9;¶ • Combined power sector and industrial CCS could provide the largest single CO2 abatement option in the U.S. in 2030 (McKinsey %26 Co., 2007)10;¶ • Costs for stabilizing CO2 with widespread CCS deployment could be reduced 30 percent or more compared to the costs without CCS (IPCC, 2005)11;¶ • CCS is likely to play a role roughly equivalent to that of energy efficiency and renewables in climate mitigation (IPCC, 2007).12¶ &#xD;

AND

II. CCS is Critical to a Zero-Carbon World¶ The title of a recent article by two leading climate researchers sums up the message emerging from the latest scientific evidence: &amp;#34;Stabilizing climate requires near-zero emissions.&amp;#34;1 Even the most dramatic, 50–80 percent CO2 reduction goals generally being discussed likely are not enough. We need a near-100-percent reduction by mid-century at the latest. Energy systems need to change faster.2¶ Part of the urgency stems from the reality that warming impacts from today~’s emissions may last as long as 1,000 years3; we cannot assume that reducing emissions &amp;#34;tomorrow&amp;#34; means we can reverse damage done to date. Worse, we risk passing irreversible &amp;#34;tipping points&amp;#34; that trigger abrupt and catastrophic changes, such as major ice melt in the polar regions, extensive rainforest loss, and radical alterations of critical weather and ocean circulation patterns. Such tipping points could be in sight if current emission trends continue for another decade or more.4¶ Unfortunately, we are moving in the wrong direction fast. In recent years, China has added coal capacity at a rate of one large new plant per week (70–100 GW per year)5 and India – potentially the world~’s most populous country by 2030 – could ramp up as well. The International Energy Agency (IEA) currently projects that world coal capacity will nearly double by 2030, an increase of 1,310 GW.6 If this build-out occurs without CCS, it will increase world CO2 emissions by about 12.6 billion metric tons annually7—roughly twice current U.S. emissions from all sources. Clearly, China, India, and other developing countries will &amp;#34;make or break&amp;#34; any global effort to cut CO2 emissions—in fact, changes in their emissions trajectory will overwhelm any plausible reductions by developed countries.¶ Numerous studies—including studies by the IEA, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the U.S. Climate Change Science Program (CCSP), and several major environmental organizations—have assessed the relative roles that different technologies might play in meeting various climate stabilization targets. This body of work (and more) suggests that CCS has economic advantages relative to other options and is likely to be indispensable in achieving a zero-carbon energy mix. Specifically, these studies (which are reviewed and summarized at the CATF Web site, http://www.catf.us/projects/power_sector/advanced_coal/) find the following:¶ • Stabilizing atmospheric CO2 at 450 parts per million by volume (ppmv) could require more than 250 GW of fossil power with CCS globally by 2030 (U.S. CCSP, 2007)8;¶ • Fossil fuels with CCS might need to provide 26 percent of global energy supply under stabilization constraints (WWF, 2007)9;¶ • Combined power sector and industrial CCS could provide the largest single CO2 abatement option in the U.S. in 2030 (McKinsey %26 Co., 2007)10;¶ • Costs for stabilizing CO2 with widespread CCS deployment could be reduced 30 percent or more compared to the costs without CCS (IPCC, 2005)11;¶ • CCS is likely to play a role roughly equivalent to that of energy efficiency and renewables in climate mitigation (IPCC, 2007).12¶

-	JAKE AND I JUST WANT TO TALK TO THE DEBATE COMMUNITY ABOUT THIS TOPIC AND WHAT WENT WRONG
-	Energy shapes how we view the world
-	We have a privilege to the Earth and I think we can agree that we haven’t been dealing with it properly
-	At first glance I was SO STOKED for energy to be my FIRST COLLEGE DEBATE TOPIC
-	It gave us the opportunity to see alternative tech
o	List
-	It gave us the opportunity to take the right side on the green resolution
-	We could have re-oriented our relationship with the climate
-	That’s important

B. What happened
- I should have known better
- Reading the topic paper it promotes fossil fuels, natural gas, crude oil – definition production as only those things in black and white ink
- Renewables are under-developed in comparison
- Written by employees of the Law firm bracewell and Giuliani, it becomes clear the ideological agenda at play
- People that care enough about how debaters process ideas about this topic to write a paper
- A tradiational understanding of the topic is not neutral

The bracewell and Giuliani website admits – THEIR PREMIER SECTOR IS ENERGY PROMOTION OF OIL AND GAS, WORKING WITH THE FERC IN WASHINGTON TO PROMOTE PIPELINES AND FOSSIL FUELS – THIS IS WHAT THEY PRIDE THEMSELVES IN

C. The concession,
- Only mention of renewables is solar and wind
- A concession to us, but tossing out the only resolution that actually ended up talking about about “alternative energy”
- All lit says that solar/wind are SUPPLEMETNS not primary structures. The current global energy regime does not want any real alternatives beign discussed

extraction or capture of energy from natural sources for final consumption by or from the operation of the facility or for use other than in the operation of the facility
manufacture of energy by the conversion of energy from one form to another form for final consumption by or from the operation of the facility, or for use other than in the operation of the facility (regulation 2.23(3) NGER Regulations).

Immigration won’t pass – 5 warrants, Obama push will ruin everything, and it’s not at the top of the docket.

Federal action is key

Aston, 7/10/12
Adam, “NEORI’s promise: Pairing utilities with big oil to revitalize CCS development – Part 2 | GCCSI”, http://www.adamaston.com/?p=982, BJM

NEORI brings together key industry players from the oil and utility sectors and proposes a set of revenue-positive federal and state incentives that will help spur the construction of a first generation of carbon capture infrastructure on power plants and other industrial emitters, to feed the CO2 to the oil industry. As important, perhaps the effort has attracted bipartisan support in an era of near-paralysis on many political fronts.
