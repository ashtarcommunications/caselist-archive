A. Peace is more than the absence of war- a limited understanding of the concept produces flawed policies- interrogation of the question “what is peace” is the primary task of policy makers
Richmond 07. Oliver Richmond, professor in International Relations and Director of the Centre for Peace and Conflict Studies at the University of St. Andrews. The Transformations of Peace. Palgrave MacMillan, 2007, pg 1.

B. Representations of war as a bounded temporal event sanitize peace time militarism and produce a politics of crises control that is incapable of dealing with complex societal interconnections that produce violence- the result is an inability to combat structural violence

Cuomo, Professor at the University of Cincinnati, 1996 Chris J., “War is Not Just an Event: Reflections on the Significance of Everyday Violence,” Hypatia v11, n4, Fall, p. database

C. Representation constructs facts and therefore must be correct before the question of policy can be approached 
Doty, assistant professor of political science at arizona state university, 1996 roxanne lynn, imperial encounters, p. 5-6

D. (text:) The alternative is rejection action and think critically of what peace is. 
This round should be about critically analyzing assumptions and rhetoric because it’s the only thing that we as individuals can control, this process allows us to escape a framework that perpetuates the harms it attempts to solve.

The Affirmative tells a pleasant story – that IFR technology can produce a world without pollution, without CO2 emissions, or better yet, a world without energy scarcity and its attendant dangers, resource wars and economic instability. All of these claims rely on the assumption of a world devoid of ideology, one where technology is always used for its intended purpose, and where its intended purpose always reflects the best interests of humanity and the world.
In this light, the claim that IFR reactors could be used to reprocess waste, spent fuel, or even weapons-grade plutonium, is factually accurate, yet completely misses the point. IFRs could be used to reprocess fissile-grade plutonium in the same way Apachi helicopters could be used to deliver food and medical supplies to dying children. The naïve observation of their capabilities eclipses their role as producers of weapons-grade fissile material in a global nuclear arms race that is still ongoing.

Jim Green, anti-nuclear advocate, Friends of the Earth Australia, July 2009, http://www.foe.org.au/anti-nuclear/issues/nfc/power-weapons/g4nw

The assumption that IFRs will be used for good is further at odds with the framing ontology of the 1AC. The Affirmative views international relations as a domain of mechanistic intervention by supposedly rational nation states. This discourse adopts an ontology of violence, in which humans, nations, and the environment are all reduced to instruments of security. It is this very framing that destines IFRs to become factories for the production of nuclear weaponry.

Anthony Burke, Professor of IR at University of New South Wales, “Ontologies of War”, in Theory and Event Vol 10, Issue 2, 2007

Furthermore, the actual dangers of IFR reactors are unknown, because the reactors themselves are new, experimental technology. The nuclear industry always claims its technology is absolutely safe, up until the moment it fails. The Aff’s projections of environmental risk are cloaked in a scientific positivism that continually produces environmental calamities in the name of what we claim to know.

Timothy Luke, Professor of Political Science at Virginia Polytechnic Institute, Eco-Managerialism: Environmental Studies as a Power/Knowledge Formation, Aurora Online, 2003 http://aurora.icaap.org/index.php/aurora/article/view/79/91 

This technological enframing not only risks ecological collapse and nuclear annihilation, but also the very essence of what it is to be human, the ability to experience the world outside of calculation.

Tad Beckman, Professor of Philosophy at Harvey Mudd, Martin Heidegger and Environmental Ethics, 2000, http://www2.hmc.edu/~tbeckman/personal/Heidart.html 

Our alternative is critique. Exposing the machinic frameworks of possibility opened up by Security and challenging the language through which we’re drawn into its web create space created for human agency and politics outside of calculation.

Anthony Burke, Professor of IR at University of New South Wales, “Aporias of Security”, in Alternatives 27, 2002
