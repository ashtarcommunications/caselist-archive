The heart of my proposal is a small and likely uncontroversial amendment to the Indian Mineral Development Act of 1982.

Sub-Point A: Kevin Carter an Icon of Anguish
Scott Macleod, ethnographer, conveys the horrifying tale of Photojournalist Kevin Carter in an obituary written for the photographer in 1994 (Time magazine, 12 September 1994, Volume 144, Number 11).

The image presaged no celebration: a child barely alive, a vulture so eager

some of Carter&amp;#39;s friends wondered aloud why he had not helped the girl. 
 
Sub-Point B: The Pulitzer Prize

Why does the affirmative refuse to defend the political implications of their agenda? At its core our argument is not particularly complex, the affirmative is an attempt at capturing the best representation of suffering while avoiding the political consequences of action. This perpetuates the sentimentalizing of suffering which precludes effective political engagement.

SUFFERING IS ONE OF THE EXISTENTIAL GROUNDS of human experience; it is a defining 
AND
same as the &amp;#34;ordinary&amp;#34; experiences of poverty and illness.(5)
 
Moreover, like Kevin Carter, the affirmative has BECOME THE VULTURE. In framing their advocacy in terms of capturing accurate representation and they reflect a political sympathy no more deep than seeking the Pulitzer prize (In debate parlance we refer to that as “winning the round”). Their refusal to engage in the political eviscerates the efficacy of their advocacy.

PROFESSIONAL APPROPRIATIONS OF THE IMAGES OF SUFFERING: PHOTOJOURNALISM AND PUBLIC HEALTH This photograph won 
AND
a global humanitarian effort to prevent silence. That is a considerable contribution.
Having learned about Carter&amp;#39;s suicide, the prize-winning image, an anonymously public 
AND
suffering to produce moral fatigue, exhaustion of empathy, and political despair.

 
Sub-Point C: Escaping the Vultures

Our alternative is to “refuse the affirmatives denial of politics.” Rather than burying our heads in the sand and pretending that debate is a game of little political consequence with only marginal rhetorical value, we should fully assume the responsibility of political participation.

Financial incentive include cash, credit and/or a reduction in the cost of doing business offered by the government or a public agency to a firm who, in turn, agrees to place or expand a facility in a location designated by the government agency. Within this context, incentives take many forms and dimensions

Violation: Tax credits are a reaction to steps already taken to reward businesses for desirable action.

Prefer our interpretation: 
Limits: The aff justifies REWARD affs massively explodes the topic because the relevant literature shifts from the government dictating market signals to the government responding to them.
Ground: Rewards should be negative ground – also affs that primarily respond and effectually motivate jack negative link ground, congressional debate surrounding incentives is based on how incentives will affect the market.

==Framework==

====The affirmative fails to promote a topical defense of government policy that~’s bad for debate.====

====First - a limited topic of discussion which provides a clear demarcation of sides in a controversy is key to foster productive debate without sacrificing creativity or innovation. Even if their position can be debated that does not make it conducive to valuable debate and decision-making. ====
**Steinberg %26 Freeley 2008**
~~Austin J. Freeley is a Boston based attorney who focuses on criminal, personal injury and civil rights law, AND **David L. Steinberg , Lecturer of Communication Studies @ U Miami, Argumentation and Debate: Critical Thinking for Reasoned Decision Making~~
Debate is a means of settling differences, so there must be a difference of 
AND
particular point of difference, which will be outlined in the following discussion.


====Second – debating specific policy action is critical—breaks out of traditional pedagogy and enhances active learning—even if we aren~’t in positions of power====
Esberg %26 Sagan 12 *Jane Esberg is special assistant to the director at New York University~’s Center on. International Cooperation. She was the winner of 2009 Firestone Medal, AND **Scott Sagan is a professor of political science and director of Stanford~’s Center for International Security and Cooperation &amp;#34;NEGOTIATING NONPROLIFERATION: Scholarship, Pedagogy, and Nuclear Weapons Policy,&amp;#34; 2/17 The Nonproliferation Review, 19:1, 95-108

These government or quasi-government think tank simulations often provide very similar lessons for 
AND
allies and adversaries, would behave in response to US policy initiatives.7
By university age, students often have a pre-defined view of international affairs
AND
quickly; simulations teach students how to contextualize and act on information.14

====And it~’s specifically important on this topic – decision-making skills and engagement with the state energy apparatus prevents energy technocracy and actualizes radical politics====
**Hager 92**
Hager, professor of political science – Bryn Mawr College, ~’92
(Carol J., &amp;#34;Democratizing Technology: Citizen %26 State in West German Energy Politics, 1974-1990&amp;#34; Polity, Vol. 25, No. 1, p. 45-70)

During this phase, the citizen initiative attempted to overcome its defensive posture and implement 
AND
a space for a delibera-tive politics in modern technological society.61

====Third, switch-side debate is key to effective decision making and prevention of atrocity. ====
Patricia **Roberts-Miller 3** is Associate Professor of Rhetoric at the University of Texas &amp;#34;Fighting Without Hatred:Hannah Ar endt ~’ s Agonistic Rhetoric&amp;#34; JAC 22.2 2003
Arendt is probably most famous for her analysis of totalitarianism (especially her The Origins 
AND
not relativist, adversarial but not violent, independent but not expressivist rhetoric.


====Decision-making outweighs:====

====The impact outweighs—deliberative debate models impart skills vital to respond to existential threats====
Christian O. Lundberg 10 Professor of Communications @ University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, &amp;#34;Tradition of Debate in North Carolina&amp;#34; in Navigating Opportunity: Policy Debate in the 21st Century By Allan D. Louden, p. 311

The second major problem with the critique that identifies a naivety in articulating debate and 
AND
their time and political energies toward policies that matter the most to them.
The merits of debate as a tool for building democratic capacity-building take on 
AND
navigate academic search databases and to effectively search and use other Web resources:
To analyze the self-report ratings of the instructional and control group students, 
AND
searching, not just in academic databases. (Larkin 2005, 144)
Larkin~’s study substantiates Thomas Worthcn and Gaylcn Pack~’s (1992, 3) claim that 
AND
cite and rely upon from an easily accessible and veritable cornucopia of materials.
There are, without a doubt, a number of important criticisms of employing debate 
AND
to the possibilities of meaningful political engagement and new articulations of democratic life.
Expanding this practice is crucial, if only because the more we produce citizens that 
AND
with the existential challenges to democracy ~~in an~~ increasingly complex world. 

====And we are the best in-road to education:====

THE AFFIRMATIVE MUST DEFEND AND AFFIRM THE TOPIC

Dismissing the idea that debaters defend the AFFIRMATIVE side encourages advocates to FALSELY VALUE affirmative 
AND
EXCHANGES allow for improvements and modifications in critical arguments. SOLVES ALL THEIR OFFENSE

GALLOWAY Asst Prof and Director of Debate @ Samford 2k7
Ryan-former GMU debater; Dinner and Conversation at the Argumentative Table:  Reconceptualizing Debate as an Argumentative Dialogue; CONTEMPORARY ARGUMENTATION AND DEBATE; Vol. 28; p. 7-8

====In addition to the basic equity norm, dismissing the idea that debaters defend the affirmative side of the topic encourages advocates to falsely value affirmative speech acts in the absence of a negative response. There may be several detrimental consequences that go unrealized in a debate where the affirmative case and plan are not topical. Without ground, debaters may fall prey to a siren~’s call, a belief that certain critical ideals and concepts are axiological, existing beyond doubt without scrutiny. Bakhtin contends that in dialogical exchanges &amp;#34;the greater the number and weight&amp;#34; of counter-words, the deeper and more substantial our understanding will be (Bakhtin, 1990). The matching of the word to the counter-word should be embraced by proponents of critical activism in the activity, because these dialogical exchanges allow for improvements and modifications in critical arguments. Muir argues that &amp;#34;debate puts students into greater contact with the real world by forcing them to read a great deal of information&amp;#34; (1993, p. 285). He continues, &amp;#34;~~t~~he constant consumption of material…is significantly constitutive. The information grounds the issues under discussion, and the process shapes the relationship of the citizen to the public arena&amp;#34; (p. 285). Through the process of comprehensive understanding, debate serves both as a laboratory and a constitutive arena. Ideas find and lose adherents. Ideas that were once considered beneficial are modified, changed, researched again, and sometimes discarded altogether. A central argument for open deliberation is that it encourages a superior consensus to situations where one side is silenced. Christopher Peters contends, &amp;#34;The theory holds that antithesis ultimately produces a better consensus, that the clash of differing, even opposing interests and ideas in the process of decision making…creates decisions that are better for having been subjected to this trial by fire&amp;#34; (1997, p.336). The combination of a competitive format and the necessity to take points of view that one does not already agree with combines to create a unique educational experience for all participants. Those that eschew the value of such experience by an axiological position short-circuit the benefits of the educational exchange for themselves, their opponents, as well as the judges and observers of such debates.====

====Affirmative strategies that suspend basic fairness norms are EXCLUSIVE, substitutes for topical action do not accrue the same dialogical benefits of topical advocacy—====
**GALLOWAY** Asst Prof and Director of Debate @ Samford **2k7**
Ryan-former GMU debater; Dinner and Conversation at the Argumentative Table:  Reconceptualizing Debate as an Argumentative Dialogue; CONTEMPORARY ARGUMENTATION AND DEBATE; Vol. 28; p. 5-7
Debate as a dialogue sets an argumentative table, where all parties receive a relatively 
AND
substitutes for topical action do not accrue the dialogical benefits of topical advocacy.

==Overview==


====Decisionmaking skills gained from debate are key to problem solving in all facets of life—outweighs the case====
Steinberg %26 Freeley 8 *Austin J. Freeley is a Boston based attorney who focuses on criminal, personal injury and civil rights law, AND **David L. Steinberg , Lecturer of Communication Studies @ U Miami, Argumentation and Debate: Critical Thinking for Reasoned Decision Making pp. 9-10
If we assume it to be possible without recourse to violence to reach agreement on all the problems implied in the employment of the idea of justice we are granting the possibility of formulating an ideal of man and society, valid for all beings endowed with reason and accepted by what we have called elsewhere the universal audience.14
I think that the only discursive methods available to us stem from techniques that are 
AND
city of man in which violence may progressively give way to wisdom.13
Whenever an individual controls the dimensions of&amp;#34; a problem, he or she can solve the problem through a personal decision. For example, if the problem is whether to go to the basketball game tonight, if tickets are not too expensive and if transportation is available, the decision can be made individually. But if a friend~’s car is needed to get to the game, then that person~’s decision to furnish the transportation must be obtained.
Complex problems, too, are subject to individual decision making. American business offers 
AND
-to-day and even hour-to-hour decisions individually.
When President George H. W. Bush launched Operation Desert Storm, when President 
AND
, debate is the only satisfactory way the exact issues can be decided:
A president, whoever he is, has to find a way of understanding the novel and changing issues which he must, under the Constitution, decide. Broadly speaking ... the president has two ways of making up his mind. The one is to turn to his subordinates—to his chiefs of staff and his cabinet officers and undersecretaries and the like—and to direct them to argue out the issues and to bring him an agreed decision…
The other way is to sit like a judge at a hearing where the issues to be decided are debated. After he has heard the debate, after he has examined the evidence, after he has heard the debaters cross-examine one another, after he has questioned them himself he makes his decision…
It is a much harder method in that it subjects the president to the stress of feeling the full impact of conflicting views, and then to the strain of making his decision, fully aware of how momentous it Is. But there is no other satisfactory way by which momentous and complex issues can be decided.16
John F. Kennedy used Cabinet sessions and National Security Council meetings to provide debate 
AND
18 All presidents, to varying degrees, encourage debate among their advisors.
We may never be called on to render the final decision on great issues of 
AND
in our intelligent self-interest to reach these decisions through reasoned debate.



====Defending a topic for the sake of deliberation is distinct from accepting it, and limiting out some arguments for the sake of that deliberation is a more productive discourse that solves the aff better====
**Talisse 2005**
(Robert, philosophy professor, Vanderbilt, &amp;#34;Deliberativist responses to activist challenges,&amp;#34; Philosophy %26 Social Criticism 31.4 - gendered language in this article refers to arguments made by two specific individuals in an article by Iris Young)

These two serious activist challenges may be summarized as follows. First, the activist 
AND
democracy are distorting in important ways and that further discourse cannot remedy these distortions


==Atchison %26 Panetta==

Using contest round debating as a political tool means that their movement never arises into anything more than a strategic ploy
**Atchison and Panetta 2009** (Jarrod Atchison, PhD. In Speech Communication.  Edward Panetta, Ph.D. in Communication. &amp;#34;Intercollegiate Debate Speech Communication: Historical Developments and Issues for the Future&amp;#34;; The SAGE Handbook of Rhetorical Studies, Pg. 28-9)

The larger problem with locating the &amp;#34;debate as activism&amp;#34; perspective within the competitive 
AND
long community problems requires a tremendous effort by a great number of people.

First – structural factors mean contest rounds are the worst vehicle for substantive community change
Atchison and Panetta 2009 (Jarrod Atchison, PhD. In Speech Communication.  Edward Panetta, Ph.D. in Communication. &amp;#34;Intercollegiate Debate Speech Communication: Historical Developments and Issues for the Future&amp;#34;; The SAGE Handbook of Rhetorical Studies, Pg. 27)
 The first problem that we isolate is the difficulty of any individual debate to 
AND
than seeking a larger community dialogue that is recorded and/or transcribed.

     As well, we need ask why the site of suffering so readily lends 
AND
the shocking and ghostly presence of pain, effaces and restricts black sentience.
     As Rankin himself states, in order for this suffering to induce a reaction 
AND
that in order to recognize suffering must substitute the self for the other.
     While Rankin attempts to ameliorate the insufficiency of feeling before the spectacle of the 
AND
of empathy related to both the devaluation and the valuation of black life?
     Empathic identification is complicated further by the fact that it cannot be extricated from 
AND
being replaced by other signs of value, as well as other bodies.
          Thus the desire to don, occupy, or possess blackness or the black 
AND
the auction block, performing before the master, and other popular amusements.


====THIS TURNS THE CASE, SPILLING THEIR HARMS OVER TO THE DEBATE SPACE====

====Avoiding engaging the topic because the state is irredeemably racist over-essentializes modern black-life—-switching sides on Afro-Pessimism crucial ====
**McWhorter 9**—Associate Professor in the English and Comparative Literature, Columbia (John, What African-American Studies Could Be, www.mindingthecampus.com/originals/2009/09/by_john_mcwhorter_while_this.html-http://www.mindingthecampus.com/originals/2009/09/by_john_mcwhorter_while_this.html) 

The answer common in such departments is that the principal mission is to teach students 
AND
disadvantage are the most important things to note and study about being black. 
The question is whether this, for all of its moral urgency in the local sense, qualifies as education under any serious definition. 
Typical is the curriculum of one African-American Studies department in a solid, selective state school west of the Mississippi. In this department, racism is, essentially, everything. 
One course teaches that &amp;#34;Housing discrimination systematically skews opportunities and life chances,&amp;#34; another that &amp;#34;racism, sexism, and heterosexism shape black life chances in a 21st century context,&amp;#34; while yet another zeroes in on &amp;#34;the effects of institutional racism on social policy, desegregation, integration, and affirmative action programs.&amp;#34; 
Then there is &amp;#34;Blacks in the Media&amp;#34; - or, rather, one 
AND
Washington in the old days, or Queen Latifah and Halle Berry today. 
Following from this glum desperation is a fetishization of radical politics as blacks~’ only constructive 
AND
same department also offers a course on, more specifically, black Marxism. 
According to this curriculum, being black has been so horrific that we are even challenged by the mere physicality of existence. One courses teaches that black women~’s bodies have to be &amp;#34;important spaces of resistance,&amp;#34; while another is based on the idea that black people have been done in by various permutations of &amp;#34;urban spatial relations.&amp;#34; 
Because racism and inequality will always exist in some forms, this all qualifies as 
AND
, gender and sexuality affect their cognitive, social, and emotional development.&amp;#34; 
One senses that the people teaching in African-American Studies departments feel that blackness is indeed something very different, likely because African slaves were unwilling immigrants. However, Ralph Ellison once asked &amp;#34;Can a people live and develop for over three hundred years simply by reacting?&amp;#34; 
To those who would consider themselves representing black people by answering in the affirmative, there are legions of black people of all walks who would heartily disagree. There is no self-standing metric of unassailable truth that justifies intellectuals treating that disagreement - that is, the life-spirit of a people millions strong making the best of the worst for four hundred years — as unworthy of serious address.

====Reform is possible—-effective decision-making key to actualize change ====
**Clark 95**—Professor of Law, Catholic University Law School. (Leroy, A Critique of Professor Derrick A. Bell~’s Thesis of the Permanence of Racism and His Strategy of Confrontation, 73 Denv. U.L. Rev. 23)

I must now address the thesis that there has been no evolutionary progress for blacks 
AND
of progress,~’ short-lived victories that slide into irrelevance.&amp;#34; n51
Progress toward reducing racial discrimination and subordination has never been &amp;#34;automatic,&amp;#34; if that 
AND
occurred in the international arena, and were not exclusively under American control.
With these qualifications, and a long view of history, blacks and their white allies achieved two profound and qualitatively different leaps forward toward the goal of equality: the end of slavery, and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Moreover, despite open and, lately, covert resistance, black progress has never been shoved back, in a qualitative sense, to the powerlessness and abuse of periods preceding these leaps forward. n52

====Black progress is undeniable—-afro-pessimism requires ignoring mass amounts of evidence to the contrary ====
**Clark 95**—Professor of Law, Catholic University Law School. (Leroy, A Critique of Professor Derrick A. Bell~’s Thesis of the Permanence of Racism and His Strategy of Confrontation, 73 Denv. U.L. Rev. 23)

Professor Bell treats the post-1960s claims of progress as an illusion: discrimination 
AND
public as massively, and often incomprehensibly and stupidly, committed to racism.



**====Their argument elevates white supremacy to an all-pervasive force that explains nearly all global oppression—-this conceptual expansion hides the actual practice of racism and makes breaking it down more difficult====**

Andersen 3 – Margaret L. Andersen, Professor of Sociology and Women~’s Studies and Vice Provost for Academic Affairs at the University of Delaware, 2003, &amp;#34;Whitewashing Race: A Critical Perspective on Whiteness,&amp;#34; in White Out: The Continuing Significance of Racism, ed Doane %26 Bonilla-Silva, p. 28
Conceptually, one of the major problems in the whiteness literature is the reification of 
AND
historical change, the shapers of contemporary America&amp;#34; (1996b:153).
Despite noting that there is differentiation among whites and warning against using whiteness as a 
AND
). But if it is all these things, it becomes an analytically useless

 concept. Christine Clark and James O~’Donnell write: &amp;#34;to reference it reifies it, to refrain from referencing it obscures the persistent, pervasive, and seemingly permanent reality of racism&amp;#34; (1999:2). Empirical investigation requires being able to identify and measure a concept— or at the very least to have a clear definition—but since whiteness has come to mean just about everything, it ends up meaning hardly anything.
