II. CCS is Critical to a Zero-Carbon World¶ The title of a recent article by two leading climate researchers sums up the message emerging from the latest scientific evidence: &amp;#34;Stabilizing climate requires near-zero emissions.&amp;#34;1 Even the most dramatic, 50–80 percent CO2 reduction goals generally being discussed likely are not enough. We need a near-100-percent reduction by mid-century at the latest. Energy systems need to change faster.2¶ Part of the urgency stems from the reality that warming impacts from today~’s emissions may last as long as 1,000 years3; we cannot assume that reducing emissions &amp;#34;tomorrow&amp;#34; means we can reverse damage done to date. Worse, we risk passing irreversible &amp;#34;tipping points&amp;#34; that trigger abrupt and catastrophic changes, such as major ice melt in the polar regions, extensive rainforest loss, and radical alterations of critical weather and ocean circulation patterns. Such tipping points could be in sight if current emission trends continue for another decade or more.4¶ Unfortunately, we are moving in the wrong direction fast. In recent years, China has added coal capacity at a rate of one large new plant per week (70–100 GW per year)5 and India – potentially the world~’s most populous country by 2030 – could ramp up as well. The International Energy Agency (IEA) currently projects that world coal capacity will nearly double by 2030, an increase of 1,310 GW.6 If this build-out occurs without CCS, it will increase world CO2 emissions by about 12.6 billion metric tons annually7—roughly twice current U.S. emissions from all sources. Clearly, China, India, and other developing countries will &amp;#34;make or break&amp;#34; any global effort to cut CO2 emissions—in fact, changes in their emissions trajectory will overwhelm any plausible reductions by developed countries.¶ Numerous studies—including studies by the IEA, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the U.S. Climate Change Science Program (CCSP), and several major environmental organizations—have assessed the relative roles that different technologies might play in meeting various climate stabilization targets. This body of work (and more) suggests that CCS has economic advantages relative to other options and is likely to be indispensable in achieving a zero-carbon energy mix. Specifically, these studies (which are reviewed and summarized at the CATF Web site, http://www.catf.us/projects/power_sector/advanced_coal/) find the following:¶ • Stabilizing atmospheric CO2 at 450 parts per million by volume (ppmv) could require more than 250 GW of fossil power with CCS globally by 2030 (U.S. CCSP, 2007)8;¶ • Fossil fuels with CCS might need to provide 26 percent of global energy supply under stabilization constraints (WWF, 2007)9;¶ • Combined power sector and industrial CCS could provide the largest single CO2 abatement option in the U.S. in 2030 (McKinsey %26 Co., 2007)10;¶ • Costs for stabilizing CO2 with widespread CCS deployment could be reduced 30 percent or more compared to the costs without CCS (IPCC, 2005)11;¶ • CCS is likely to play a role roughly equivalent to that of energy efficiency and renewables in climate mitigation (IPCC, 2007).12¶ &#xD;

II. CCS is Critical to a Zero-Carbon World¶ The title of a recent article by two leading climate researchers sums up the message emerging from the latest scientific evidence: &amp;#34;Stabilizing climate requires near-zero emissions.&amp;#34;1 Even the most dramatic, 50–80 percent CO2 reduction goals generally being discussed likely are not enough. We need a near-100-percent reduction by mid-century at the latest. Energy systems need to change faster.2¶ Part of the urgency stems from the reality that warming impacts from today~’s emissions may last as long as 1,000 years3; we cannot assume that reducing emissions &amp;#34;tomorrow&amp;#34; means we can reverse damage done to date. Worse, we risk passing irreversible &amp;#34;tipping points&amp;#34; that trigger abrupt and catastrophic changes, such as major ice melt in the polar regions, extensive rainforest loss, and radical alterations of critical weather and ocean circulation patterns. Such tipping points could be in sight if current emission trends continue for another decade or more.4¶ Unfortunately, we are moving in the wrong direction fast. In recent years, China has added coal capacity at a rate of one large new plant per week (70–100 GW per year)5 and India – potentially the world~’s most populous country by 2030 – could ramp up as well. The International Energy Agency (IEA) currently projects that world coal capacity will nearly double by 2030, an increase of 1,310 GW.6 If this build-out occurs without CCS, it will increase world CO2 emissions by about 12.6 billion metric tons annually7—roughly twice current U.S. emissions from all sources. Clearly, China, India, and other developing countries will &amp;#34;make or break&amp;#34; any global effort to cut CO2 emissions—in fact, changes in their emissions trajectory will overwhelm any plausible reductions by developed countries.¶ Numerous studies—including studies by the IEA, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the U.S. Climate Change Science Program (CCSP), and several major environmental organizations—have assessed the relative roles that different technologies might play in meeting various climate stabilization targets. This body of work (and more) suggests that CCS has economic advantages relative to other options and is likely to be indispensable in achieving a zero-carbon energy mix. Specifically, these studies (which are reviewed and summarized at the CATF Web site, http://www.catf.us/projects/power_sector/advanced_coal/) find the following:¶ • Stabilizing atmospheric CO2 at 450 parts per million by volume (ppmv) could require more than 250 GW of fossil power with CCS globally by 2030 (U.S. CCSP, 2007)8;¶ • Fossil fuels with CCS might need to provide 26 percent of global energy supply under stabilization constraints (WWF, 2007)9;¶ • Combined power sector and industrial CCS could provide the largest single CO2 abatement option in the U.S. in 2030 (McKinsey %26 Co., 2007)10;¶ • Costs for stabilizing CO2 with widespread CCS deployment could be reduced 30 percent or more compared to the costs without CCS (IPCC, 2005)11;¶ • CCS is likely to play a role roughly equivalent to that of energy efficiency and renewables in climate mitigation (IPCC, 2007).12¶ &#xD;
