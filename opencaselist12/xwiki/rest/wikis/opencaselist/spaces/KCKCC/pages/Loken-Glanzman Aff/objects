May, if life is sheer toil, a man
Lift his eyes and say: so
I too wish to be? Yes. As long as Kindness
The Pure, still stays with his heart, man
Not unhappily measures himself
Against the godhead. Is God unknown?
Is he manifest like the sky? I’d sooner
Believe the latter. It’s the measure of man.
Full of merit, yet poetically, man
Dwells on this earth. But no purer 
Is the shade of the starry night, 
If I might put it so, than
Man, who’s called an image of the godhead.
Is there a measure on the earth? There is
None.
— Hölderlin
I have committed the worst of sins
One can commit. I have not been
Happy. Let the glaciers of oblivion
Take and engulf me, mercilessly.
My parents bore me for the risky
And the beautiful game of life,
For earth, water, air and fire.
I failed them, I was not happy.
Their youthful hope for me unfulfilled.
I applied my mind to the symmetric
Arguments of art, its web of trivia.
They willed me bravery. I was not brave.
It never leaves me. Always at my side,
That shadow of a melancholy man.
-Borges 

We abandon control…. We abandon the desire to know… we question what it means to know… the resolution tells us to reduce restrictions or to increase incentives for technology… more technology… more technology… more technology… more technology… less control…. More technology… but what is technology? What does it mean to build? What does it mean to create energy? What is “alternative energy”… what is energy … We want to know, but we question how we know.. and what it means to know … But at the same time we don’t want to know… We abandon the desire to know if the price of “knowing” is too high… but we embrace knowing if the cost is revealed to us…
Western managerial practices know what it means to know…. To know means to produce… to know means to consume… to know means to make money… to know means to spend money… to know means to store energy… to know means to exploit energy… to know means to USE energy… to know means to embrace Plato
Mother earth is not happy with us… so the resolution tells us to produce more technology under the guise of final solutions…. Because through final solutions we are able to “know” and through this “knowing” we are able to solve…. But solve for what? Do we solve the paradox of knowing? What is a paradox?
To know is the reason we are faced with ecological destruction… through knowing we were able to justify destruction… via enlightened western practices… and the resolution tells us to keep knowing… Because it has worked so well up to this point! Actually never mind scratch that We don’t actually believe that… we love the West
But again Payton and I abandon the desire to know, but we still want to know… but in order to know we must abandon control… through this abandonment we find the middle ground… we start with the resolution… we embrace the desire to know in so far as you don’t understand what we’re talking about, but we step outside of the desire to control… So let’s begin…
Resolved: The United States Federal Government should substantially reduce restrictions on and/or substantially increase financial incentives for energy production in the United States of one or more of the following: coal, crude oil, natural gas, nuclear power, solar power, wind power.


Contention One: don’t build your house on sand 
We begin with building the floor… that was quick… now onward!! To the west
Next the high beams build build build!!!
Our advocacy is a mode letting beings Be that focuses on dwelling. There are two processes critical to achieving this mode of Being.
First: We must learn to Build. Building calls out to us—teaching us to dwell and think in the world… we must escape the house of knowing… and replace it with the house of being… the house of middle man… destroy the house of knowing … destroy… destroy 
Heidegger 71 (Martin. “Building Dwelling Thinking” in Poetry, Language, Thought. Pg. 158-161.)
The making of such… sake of dwelling. 
Now the sheet rock look at that MASSIVE ERECTION of sheet rock!!!
Second: We must learn to Think. Our poetic discourse constitutes the major shift toward thinking that is critical to augment the physical act of building. Only the culmination of these in dwelling can bring change that is critical to saving the planet……….. through learning how to think… we may begin to understand what it means to know
Heidegger 71 (Martin. “…Poetically Man Dwells…” in Poetry, Language, Thought. Pg. 227.)
But dwelling occurs …structure of dwelling.
The ROOF ~-~-- THE HOUSE IS COMPLETE… THE ERECTION IS FULLY ERECT!  
We will defend both the physical act of building energy stations and also the poetic thinking engendered by our actions. The advantage we claim is learning to dwell.  Rather than attempting to master and control the world, we will let beings Be. In dwelling we are released from the endless destruction inaugurated by the Will to Will. We can feel our actions through everyone around us… we can feel the wings of a butterfly flap from thousands of miles away… we are one… we are all… We fully understand the phrase: There are two ways of tilling the soil… the house is now complete…. Please step foot into your new home…. Your new home of thinking… but , approach this home with caution and with endurance…. To understand what it means to know and to understand what it means to produce and to consume and to create we must accept that it is a slow process….. and we must learn from one another …. 
Zimmerman 81 (Michael, Prof of Philo at Tulane and Clinical Professor of Psychology at Tulane Medical. Eclipse of the Self pp. 245-8 1981) 
Under the domination …Christianity calls “grace.”

Contention Two: Castrating the ERECTION 
Have the past struggles succeeded?
What has succeeded? Yourself? Your nation?
 Nature?
Now understand me well—It is provided in the 
 essence of things, that from any fruition of suc-
 cess, no matter what, shall come forth something 
 to make a greater struggle necessary.
—Walt Whitman, “Poem of the Road” s. 53, Leaves of Grass, 1860
Crises are inevitable. We don’t claim to solve for all the harms of either energy or destructive modes of Being. Even in the event of political and practical successes, we affirm the possibility of new and “greater struggles” that lie beyond our narrow scope of perception. It is the call for quick fixes and final solutions that re-creates ever-escalating catastrophes. Only through dwelling can we escape crisis-driven ontology and let Being reveal itself  
All paths are equally dangerous, but only consciously risking ourselves can rescue thought from its apocalyptic preoccupation with calculation. Such openness to insecurity keeps alive the questioning that is necessary to prevent the conditions that led Heidegger to Nazism 
Dillon 96 (Michael. Politics of Security: Towards a political philosophy of continental thought. pg. 32-33)
While we …alive within you. 
Here’s one more card that says that we’re right…. Because we now KNOW! We know what it means to KNOW … vote for us because we finally understand KNOWING
McWhorter 92 (Ladelle, Professor of Philosophy and Women’s Studies at Richmond, Heidegger and the earth: Essays in environmental philosophy, Thomas Jefferson University Press, pp. 4-5)
