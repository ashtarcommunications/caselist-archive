Lift his eyes and say: so&#xD;
I too wish to be? Yes. As long as Kindness&#xD;
The Pure, still stays with his heart, man&#xD;
Not unhappily measures himself&#xD;
Against the godhead. Is God unknown?&#xD;
Is he manifest like the sky? I’d sooner&#xD;
Believe the latter. It’s the measure of man.&#xD;
Full of merit, yet poetically, man&#xD;
Dwells on this earth. But no purer &#xD;
Is the shade of the starry night, &#xD;
If I might put it so, than&#xD;
Man, who’s called an image of the godhead.&#xD;
Is there a measure on the earth? There is&#xD;
None.&#xD;

&#xD;
Energy production and its use is predicated on an ontological enframing of the earth as standing reserve to be extracted and stored for use without end. Our affirmative seeks to free ourselves up to a mode of sustainable being by recognizing that focusing on beings rather being forecloses the whole picture of being.. through poetically dwelling we can let time reveal the true essence of being…  Backhaus 2009 April 20, Gary, Loyola College in Maryland, Department of Philosophy “Automobility: Global Warming as Symptomatology,” Sustainability 1, 187-208, online&#xD;
The twentieth-century philosopher… from its clearing.&#xD;
This ontology of enframing devastates the earth and renders it an unworld devoid of being – this is worse than mere annihilation because devastation represents the foreclosure of all possibilities of life while annihilation is merely a leveling out to zero.

Ultimately, therefore, attention… survival in the world.&#xD;
Resolved: The United States federal government should substantially increase alternative energy incentives for agricultural solar energy production &#xD;
Contention two: Disrupting the enframing&#xD;
&#xD;
Industrialized agriculture enframes the production process as a critical mobilization of the standing reserve, bringing humanity to the zero point of the holocaust&#xD;
&#xD;
Solar energy can efficiently supply almost all farming energy needs, but requires government backing &#xD;

&#xD;
Using the sun… small irrigation systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
Only federal government subsidies can drive the transition to solarized agriculture—this stimulates the small-farm polycropping that is key to re-creating genetic resiliency and diversity by eliminating the need for fertilizers and pesticides&#xD;

&#xD;
In drafting these… sun-based fertility.&#xD;
&#xD;
Renewable energy and localized agriculture present an authentic relationship with the earth that is critical to overcoming the standing reserve. Rather than exploiting the natural world through willful mastery, we cultivate an explicit relationship with Being&#xD;

Contention three: Paradox&#xD;
&#xD;
Have the past struggles succeeded?&#xD;
What has succeeded? Yourself? Your nation?&#xD;
	Nature?&#xD;
Now understand me well—It is provided in the &#xD;
	essence of things, that from any fruition of suc-&#xD;
	cess, no matter what, shall come forth something &#xD;
	to make a greater struggle necessary.&#xD;

All paths are equally dangerous, but only consciously risking ourselves can rescue thought from its apocalyptic preoccupation with calculation. Such openness to insecurity keeps alive the questioning that is necessary to prevent the conditions that led Heidegger to Nazism &#xD;

Devastation (Verwüstung) is the process ….. Terror is the threat of being.&#xD;

Thus my colleague and I present the following plan: &#xD;
&#xD;
Resolved: The United States federal government should substantially increase financial incentives for agricultural solar power production&#xD;
Contention two: Disrupting the enframing&#xD;
&#xD;
Industrialized agriculture enframes the production process as a critical mobilization of the standing reserve, bringing humanity to the zero point of the holocaust&#xD;

Agriculture is now a motorized ….the same as the production of the hydrogen bombs.&#xD;

And yet the revealing …. either for destruction or for peaceful use.&#xD;

&#xD;
&#xD;
Topsoil is the most important and through a genuine respectful relationship within the mesh to the ground we are able to preserve the top soil. Viewing the soil as part of our neighborhood is key to sustainability—in the top soil death is turned into life and life creates more life—a never ending cycle—an example  of life forever in flux and constantly persevering… Our focus should not be on how much topsoil we have left, but rather on the soil itself – we should feel the soil falling through our hands and the life forms crawling on and through us… Berry 2005 (Wendell farmer, writer, academic Graduated from standford and taught at university college in Brox) &#xD;
It is apparently impossible ….. to understand or diagram the  pattern. &#xD;

What part, in this universe,  ….. everyone into a collective suicide&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
Do not stand at my grave and weep,&#xD;
I am not there; I do not sleep.&#xD;
I am a thousand winds that blow,&#xD;
I am the diamond glints on snow,&#xD;
I am the sun on ripened grain,&#xD;
I am the gentle autumn rain.&#xD;
When you awaken in the morning’s hush&#xD;
I am the swift uplifting rush&#xD;
Of quiet birds in circling flight.&#xD;
I am the soft star-shine at night.&#xD;
Do not stand at my grave and cry,&#xD;
I am not there; I did not die&#xD;
