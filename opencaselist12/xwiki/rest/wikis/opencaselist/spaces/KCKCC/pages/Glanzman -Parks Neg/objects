Interpretation – The affirmative must affirm the topic instrumentally. The 1AC must include a topical plan that is justified with a normative defense of federal government adoption of such a policy. 

B. Definitional Support:

1.	The topic is defined by the phrase following the colon – the USFG is the agent of the resolution, not the individual debaters
	Webster’s Guide to Grammar and Writing – 2000
	http://ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/marks/colon.htm
Use of a colon before a list or an explanation that is preceded by a clause that can stand by itself. Think of the colon as a gate, inviting one to go on… If the introductory phrase preceding the colon is very brief and the clause following the colon represents the real business of the sentence, begin the clause after the colon with a capital letter.

2.	Should denotes an expectation of enacting a plan
	American Heritage Dictionary – 2000 www.dictionary.com
	3 Used to express probability or expectation

3.	The USFG is the government in Washington D.C.
	Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2000 http://encarta.msn.com
	“The federal government of the United States is centered in Washington DC.”

C. Violation – The affirmative is not an instrumental affirmation of the resolution 

D. Reasons to Prefer

1.	Ground – Refusing to defend the implementation of the plan/resolution erases all predictable negative counterplan, disadvantage and case ground. While we may have arguments indicting the idea of the plan or personal advocacy, we’ll never have evidence saying their specific advocacy of the plan is bad. This eliminates all of our resolutionally-based offensive arguments.

2.	Topical Education – By manipulating the topic to access a political project they destroy discussion of the important question asked by the resolution. This tactic promotes debate that is either stagnant or shallow 
 
Framework 1NC

3.	 Extra Topicality – Even if they claim to “defend” their plan – they skirt discussion of its merits by arguing the benefits derived from their advocacy outweigh. This is a voting issue because we’re forced to win framework just to get back to equal footing – extra topicality also proves the resolution insufficient and explodes aff ground.

4.	Bad Policymaking – The affirmative subverts discussion of the merits of specific policies, which negates our ability to compare the effects of the plan to the status quo. This ruins a critical function of this activity which is to test the desirability of policy implementation.

E. Voting Issue – If we demonstrate the affirmative does not meet the best interpretation of the topic they have failed to justify the resolution and should be rejected. This is the best way to preserve competitive equity by ensuring predictable ground for the negative. 

Also, instrumentality is a jurisdictional voting issue 
Ruth Lesl Shively, Professor of Politics at Texas AandM, 2000 Partisan Politics and Political Theory, p. 181-2
In most cases, however, our agreements... basic agreement or harmony.

Cultural critics have painstakingly demonstrated the social constructedness... a property status of non-human animals.&#xD;

&#xD;

The affirmative frames existence in terms of human value – this ethic creates the world as standing reserve and legitimizes endless genocide&#xD;

In the ethics of hybrids our ethical relationship with things... everything is potentially equally valuable/valueless; &#xD;

&#xD;
The alternative is to vote negative to reject speciesism by critically reorienting ourselves against the 1AC. Our creation of a space for reflection is a key step in ending non-human oppression.&#xD;

Epistemological and moral tensions such as these, however, can be the impetus for social critique: a “place”... factory farming practices (and subsequent animal suffering).&#xD;

The formula for success is knowledge, power, mobility, and determination... The landscape of risk is omnipresent.

And, our worship of that acceleration makes a catastrophic accident inevitable—the politics of speed turns the case and guarantees war and extinction—Sykes 9 

Jason Sykes,  Economics—UNT, “Paul Virilio’s critique of speed, technology, and institutions,” April 19, 2009, Lexis KR

In Virlio’s view, the war machine is the demiurge of technological development... Our escape lies in slowing down. “We must politicize speed. (Virilio, 1983, pg. 35)”

The alternative is to brake—academic discussions must slow down and critically investigate the politics of speed before we come to a decision.  Your responsibility as an intellectual and the roll of the ballot is to vote negative to foster engagement that doesn’t rush engagement—Glezos 9

Simon Glezos is a Ph.D. in political theory and international relations from Johns Hopkins University, now works in the department of political science at University of Regina“The politics of speed: Capitalism, the state and war in an accelerating world” dissertation pg. 93-94, 2009 KR

The goal then is thus to politicize the military, to politicize war... war and the (Globalitarian) state
