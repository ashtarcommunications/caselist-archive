Inherency.  
The pace of conversion of United States military grade HEU to civilian energy production is decreasing in the status quo.

From 1999 to 2001, Mr. Stockton served as Special Assistant to Department of Energy Secretary Bill Richardson as his personal troubleshooter on physical and cyber security in the nuclear weapons complex. Prior to that, for twenty-two years, Mr. Stockton was the senior investigator on the House Energy and Power and the House Oversight and Investigations Subcommittees of the Energy and Commerce Committee. During the 1970s, he investigated most of the major defense contractors and oil companies, the diversion of bomb-grade uranium to Israel, and the death of Karen Silkwood.

Plan Text: The Commander and Chief of the United States should officially declare that 300 metric tons of Highly Enriched Uranium currently restricted from civilian energy production processes is in excess of United State Military needs. 

 
Advantage 1. Proliferation and Nuclear Terrorism.
Scenario 1 is Theft:

A) HEU stock piles drastically increase the acquisition of nuclear weapons by sophisticated nation states and terrorist organizations.

E) Cutting excess stock of HEU decreases risk of nuke terrorism

Scenario 2-Proliferation
A)  Proliferation is increasing and the modernization of weapons and only serves to increase instability. Nuclear disarmament is key to halting.

C) Prolif drastically increases the risk of accidents – guarantees nuclear war

Accidents happen, but the price of a nuclear accident is impermissible. Yet, past incidents over the last several decades far less known than “Chernobyl” could very well have led to more catastrophic results: 1979, U.S. Mistakes Computer Exercise for Soviet Nuclear Strike.
