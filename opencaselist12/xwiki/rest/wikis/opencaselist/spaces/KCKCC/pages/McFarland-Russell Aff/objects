The United States federal government should pass the topically relevant portions of the Native American Energy Act (H.R. 3973).&#xD;
 &#xD;
OBSERVATION 1 IS SELF-DETERMINATION&#xD;
Current status quo policies towards energy production on native land squashes any hope of self-determination—FREIDEL 6 &#xD;
[“Who Will Profit From Native Energy?” Research from Ph.D. Candidates/ Students: Ioana Lupu, Mayra Madrigal at Sonoma State University, Dolly Freidel, Ph.D. / Professor of Geography and Global Studies at Sonoma State University, Published in LiP Magazine, June 5, 2006, Title: “Native Energy Futures,” http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/25-who-will-profit-from-native-energy/] &#xD;
&#xD;
Energy on Native American land is becoming big business. According to the Indigenous Environmental &#xD;
AND&#xD;
indebted to, the very industry currently driving the planet to its doom.&#xD;
&#xD;
AND, Tribal leaders agree—the plan is the only way to increase tribal self-determination—GROEN 12 &#xD;
[Wilson, president and chief executive officer. Testimony on “The Native American Energy Act.” Before the sub-committee on Indian and Alaska Native Affairs. February 15th, 2012.  Accessed August 10th, 2012]&#xD;
&#xD;
The NNOGC fully supports &#xD;
AND&#xD;
a long way to achieve these objectives. &#xD;
&#xD;
However, action on the legislation is uncertain—FRIENDS COMMITTEE ON NATIONAL LEGISLATION 12&#xD;
[June 20, 2012. Native American Legislative update. One Step Closer to Energy Development in Indian Country. Accessed August 10, 2012]&#xD;
&#xD;
Although House leadership expect&#xD;
AND&#xD;
future action on the Native American Energy Act is uncertain. &#xD;
&#xD;
Self-determination isn’t an all or nothing issue—It’s about the perpetual pursuit of freedom. Any other mindset justifies the continued exploitation of native peoples—SUAGEE 92 &#xD;
[Dean B. attorney, , SELF-DETERMINATION FOR INDIGENOUS PEOPLES AT THE DAWN OF THE SOLAR AGE, University of Michigan Law Review, LexisNexis]  &#xD;
&#xD;
In the controversy over the right to self-determination, many observers, both &#xD;
AND&#xD;
external self-determination, the absolutist view neglects internal self-determination. &#xD;
&#xD;
Lack of self-determination is an example of “the ungrievable life” that allows for people to perceive others’ lives as “unreal.” This perception justifies all forms of physical violence—BUTLER 4 &#xD;
[Judith; Professor in Rhetoric at UC Berkeley; Undoing Gender pg. 24-25]&#xD;
&#xD;
So what is the relation between violence and what is &amp;#34;unreal,&amp;#34; between violence &#xD;
AND&#xD;
loss, the discursive elaborations of what these losses mean for communities there?&#xD;
&#xD;
OBSERVATION 2 IS COLONIALIZATION&#xD;
&#xD;
Status quo policies are colonialist and exclude native voices—This perpetuates the same colonialist policies of the last 500 years—ROBYN 2 &#xD;
[Linda Robyn, the assistant professor in the Criminal Justice Department at Northern Arizona University, 2002. “Indigenous Knowledge and Technology: Creating Environmental Justice in the Twenty-First Century”. The American Indian Quarterly, 26.2 (2002), p. 210]&#xD;
&#xD;
Social control is always an exercise of power. Linear colonial logic argues that those &#xD;
AND&#xD;
the state of Wisconsin and huge multinational corporations is but one such example. &#xD;
&#xD;
Plan solves—It gives natives self-sufficiency—PELHAM 12&#xD;
[Victoria, Staff writer for Cronkite News. February 15th, 2012. Tribes back bill to ease federal oversight of indian-land energy projects. Accessed August 12, 2012]&#xD;
&#xD;
Representatives from a half-dozen tribes spoke to a House Natural Resources subcommittee in &#xD;
AND&#xD;

Colonialism locks native people into a cycle of every day suffering—BARSH 93&#xD;
[Russel Lawrence Barsh, Professor of Native American Studies at the University of Lethbridge and United Nations Representative of the Mikmaq Grand Council and Four Directions Council, University of Michigan Journal of Law Reform, Winter, 1993, 26 U. Mich. J.L. Ref. 277] &#xD;
&#xD;
If there is a fundamental cause of American Indian isolationism, it is 500 years &#xD;
AND&#xD;
Also lost was confidence in the possibility of genuine self-determination.&#xD;
&#xD;
Native Americans are colonized citizens of the United States, and forced into a policy of white superiority. This subjugation leaves them an exploited hollow shell—YELLOW BIRD 4&#xD;
[Michael Yellow Bird, Associate Professor Center for Indigenous Nations Studies, 2004-10, Wicazo Sa Review, Vol. 19, No. 2, Colonization/Decolonization, I, (Autumn, 2004), pp.33-48, http://www.jstor.org/stable/1409497]&#xD;
&#xD;
America has carefully made sure that Indigenous Peoples continue to fulfill the role of a &#xD;
AND&#xD;
and Indians will continue to be toys of genocide, icons of colonialism.&#xD;
&#xD;
Colonization bolsters a patriarchal mindset that literally rapes Native bodies with dominant Western ideologies—SMITH 3 &#xD;

&#xD;
Similarly, Kate Shanley notes that Native peoples are a permanent &amp;#34;pres-ent &#xD;
AND&#xD;
to tan and turn into bridle reins. (Stannard 1992, 121) &#xD;
&#xD;
AND, colonial/ patriarchal mindset marginalizes women and seeks to control nature. Operating under the current ideologies ties the US to a permanent social war with the Natives that only breeds racism, sexism and xenophobic future politics—SMITH 3 &#xD;

&#xD;
The connection between the colonization of the bodies of Native peoples,&#xD;
AND&#xD;
hearts of the women [and their bodies as well] are on the ground.&amp;#34; &#xD;
 &#xD;
Patriarchal thinking justifies environmental destruction, nuclear proliferation and culminates in extinction—WARREN AND CADY 94&#xD;
[Karen and Duane, Feminism and Peace: Seeing Connections, Hypatia, Vol. 9, No. 2, Spring, p4-20]&#xD;
&#xD;
Operationalized, the evidence of patriarchy as a dysfunctional system &#xD;
AND&#xD;
women-nature-peace connections in regional, national and global contexts.&#xD;
&#xD;
AND, Traditional understandings of warfare as great power conflict of nations over territory contributes to the invisibility of an ongoing systemic war against women—RAY 97 &#xD;
[Amy E. Ray, Law Clerk at U.S. Court of Appeals Fourth Circuit and JD at Florida State, “The Shame of It: Gender-Based Terrorism in the Former Yugoslavia and the Failure of International Human Rights Law to Comprehend the Injuries,” Pg. 46, Am. U.L. Rev. 793, February 1997]&#xD;
&#xD;
The international community must recognize that violence against women&#xD;
AND&#xD;
applicable to women &amp;#34;in the by-ways of daily life.&amp;#34;&#xD;

OBSERVATION 3 IS NO DISADS&#xD;
&#xD;
Causal predictions of worst-case scenarios are biased and poor scholarship—KANWISHER 89&#xD;

&#xD;
It might be argued that biases in the subjective probabilities of scenarios do not matter &#xD;
AND&#xD;
the problem of psychological distortions would resurface.&#xD;
&#xD;
The judge should make an ethical decision about violence against women – this requires setting aside issues of political expediency – Patriarchy produces knowledge is such a way that you should question all of their truth claims—ENLOE 4 &#xD;

Since ‘it is impossible to escape ...what it wants to secure.

The state wields the dichotomy of the other to perpetuate fear and control through biopolitical lies; forcing us all to subject our rights to a sovereign state power. This perpetuates the permission of force in any means to “protect” us from the other.  Their impact scenarios are lies that perpetuate this power.

Colonization isn’t just the stealing of land, but stealing bodily identities. Colonization forces the colonized to conform to the sexual values of the colonizer.

Because of this the people of the Native Two-Spirit are assigned with no value and live a life of self-hatred—DRISKELL 4
