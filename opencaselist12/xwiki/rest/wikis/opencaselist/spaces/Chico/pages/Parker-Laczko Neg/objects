The core of these antinomies is the unity of necessity and violence …That is, radical alterity is ide­ology critique as the foundational mode of political action.

For Zizek it is imperative that we cut through this Gord­ian knot of …reduce the status of the abject Other to that of a ‘glitch’ in an otherwise sound matrix.

financial incentives ~~12~~. Seven states currently have equipment certification programs in place

====Violation: The Aff simply provides funding for SMRs – this is not a financial incentive====

====Reasons to Vote Negative:====

====Ground – the aff destroys neg ground – we cannot garner links to disads based on traditional financial incentives like tax incentives and loans if they simply provide the money necessary ====

====Limits/Predictability – they explode the topic by forcing the affirmative to be prepared for any unprecedented funding created by an aff====

====Education – the aff kills topic specific education by diverting the debate away from energy financial incentives and discussing what it would be like to give a company or agency or other actor money to develop technology.  Financial incentivization functions distinctly from funding====

====Topicality is a voter for fairness and education ====

This combination of factors will make it easier to pass immigration reform in Congress, which would have a big economic impact on Mexico and Central America, among other things because the legalization of 11 million undocumented immigrants would prompt many of them to get legal jobs, earn more and send more family remittances back home.
But it may also translate into other U.S. initiatives, including a re-formulation of U.S. anti-drug polices and closer trade ties with Mexico, Peru, Chile and other Pacific Rim countries that are part of Obama~’s proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership economic plan.

=NU 1NC RD2 VS GEORGETOWN=

==1==
1.	Interpretation: The affirmative should have to specify the method of increased energy production
2.	Violation: They don~’t do that – their plan text mandates that electricity is &amp;#34;obtained&amp;#34; meaning it doesn~’t GUARANTEE an INCREASE in energy production or even incentivizes it – they could obtain electricity from existing reactors
3.	Reasons to prefer – 
a.	Limits: the aff explodes the topic by justifying a litany of different methods of obtaining energy production – they may not necessarily result in an increase in energy production 
b.	Time skew: Clarifying in the 2AC causes massive time and strat skew for the neg – allows them to skirt our offense
4.	This is a voter for fairness and education

==2==
A.	Interpretation:  The resolutions demands that the affirmative substantially increase financial incentives for energy production in the United States.

&amp;#34;For&amp;#34; is a limiting term that refers to PURPOSE of the financial incentives:
**Merriam Webster, accessed 2013  ~~http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/for~~**

**&amp;#34;used as **a function word to indicate purpose** a grant for studying medicine&amp;#34;**

**&amp;#34;Production&amp;#34; means the incentives should fund the act or process of transforming inputs into outputs – creation of energy &amp;#34;goods&amp;#34; – process of transformation**
**Patil, 2012  ~~Manoj Patil, Guarav Akrani under guidance of Professor Mudit Katyani, &amp;#34;What is production? Definition meaning transformation process,&amp;#34; Feb. 3, http://kalyan-city.blogspot.com/2012/02/what-is-production-definition-meaning.html~~**

Production is a process of transforming (converting) inputs (raw-materials) into outputs (finished goods). So, production means the creation of goods and services. It is done to satisfy human wants. Thus, production is a process of transformation.

&amp;#34;In the United States&amp;#34; dictates the energy must be created within the 50 states and relevant U.S. territories. 

A.	Violation:  The affirmative obtains the outputs of the production – the electricity, it does not provide financial incentives for the CREATION of those outputs.  This is simply a form of consumption, not production. This means they are FX which is an independent voter 

B.	Standards:
Limits:  Although they may be able to come up with a definition of production that they meet, it does not make it a good, limiting interpretation.  Ours limits out affs that simply pay for energy, while allowing affs that provide incentives to CREATE that energy.
Brightline – the aff has to provide incentives for the PROCESS of TRANSFORMATION not simply the output.  They explode the topic by justifying plans that have the government purchase PRODUCED energy instead of funding PRODUCTION of that energy.

Moots words:  Their interpretation moots the word PRODUCTION from the resolution.  The affirmative simply increases financial incentives for energy, not the PRODUCTION of that energy.  

Plan focus:  Their plan should be the focus of the debate and it does not actually legislate any increase in financial incentives for energy production, but simply purchases electricity IF and WHEN the energy gets produced.

C.	Voter – for reasons of fairness and ground.

Washington, DC - The White House is praising an agreement on immigration reform reached 
AND
out his vision, which is expected to overlap with the Senate effort.


Obama~’s push ensures a quick, bipartisan deal this also answers their Obama not leading 
**Fort Worth Star-Telegram 2/5** (&amp;#34;Finally, a bipartisan approach to immigration policy&amp;#34;, http://www.bnd.com/2013/02/05/2484257/finally-a-bipartisan-approach.html-http://www.bnd.com/2013/02/05/2484257/finally-a-bipartisan-approach.html, CMR)

With leadership from the president, both political parties and both houses of Congress, 
AND
a cross-section of business, educational and religious leaders and organizations.

Obama will dedicate ALL his PC to immigration – 
**Waterman 2/3** (Margaret, &amp;#34;Immigration reform likely, BU professor, students say&amp;#34;, http://dailyfreepress.com/2013/02/03/immigration-reform-likely-bu-professor-students-say/-http://dailyfreepress.com/2013/02/03/immigration-reform-likely-bu-professor-students-say/, CMR)

An ongoing battle in the U.S., the passing of immigration reform now 
AND
. &amp;#34;It~’s easier to get away with somewhat much more controversial legislation.&amp;#34;



===They say that Obama  PC Not Key ===
(   ) Obama~’s capital is key
**Shifter, 12/27** —- adjunct professor of Latin American politics at Georgetown University~’s School of Foreign Service  (12/27/2012, Michael, Revista Ideel, &amp;#34;Will Obama Kick the Can Down the Road?&amp;#34; http://www.thedialogue.org/page.cfm?pageID=32%26pubID=3186-http://www.thedialogue.org/page.cfm?pageID=32%26pubID=3186) CMR

There is, however, a notable change in Obama~’s style compared to the first 
AND
Obama is more inclined to take the initiative and draw some clear lines.
How the &amp;#34;fiscal cliff&amp;#34; question is managed and ultimately resolved will likely shape the tenor and climate for Obama~’s second-term agenda.   If it leaves a bitter taste, then the rest of Obama~’s domestic priorities will be more difficult to achieve.   If both parties think they gained something in the bargain, prospects for results in other areas will improve.
Not surprisingly, Obama has been explicit that reforming the US~’s shameful and broken immigration 
AND
, there was talk, in both parties, of comprehensive immigration reform.
Despite the sudden optimism about immigration reform, there is, of course, no guarantee that it will happen.    It will require a lot of negotiation and deal-making.  Obama will have to invest a lot of his time and political capital — twisting some arms, even in his own party.   Resistance will not disappear.  
There is also a chance that something unexpected could happen that would put off consideration of immigration reform.   Following the horrific massacre at a Connecticut elementary school on December 14, for example, public pressure understandably mounted for gun control, at least the ban of assault weapons.   But a decision to pursue that measure — though desperately needed — would take away energy and time from other priorities like immigration.

Their Rubio argument just says that he is liked not that he is key to immigration reform. They also don~’t have an argument about how political theory works. Prefer our sato evidence that Obama is key to getting not only republicans but also memebers of his own party on board for immigration. 
Obama~’s prioritization is key to passage

Here~’s what we came up with.
1. Be a Leader
During Obama~’s first term, bipartisan legislation never got off the ground. The president 
AND
is a step in that direction, but he needs to follow through. 

Obama~’s capital and bipartisan cooperation are key to effective reform

SUBSTANTIALLY IMPAIRS ITS VALUE.  What constitutes defect in article which &amp;#34;substantially impairs its value,&amp;#34; within Uniform Commercial Code provision entitling buyer to revoke acceptance for such defect, is factual determination to be made by the trier of fact, and although term may not be susceptible to being precisely defined, it connotes more than mere minor, easily repairable defects in goods.

D. Topicality is a voter for fairness ground and education

Violation – the aff mandates a &amp;#34;substantial reduction&amp;#34; but does not dictate what that reduction constitutes, meaning it could be just enough to begin drilling – this is not necessarily substantial. 
The plan is only a minor increase in financial incentive for energy production.

C.  BETTER INTERPRETATION STANDARDS (choose one or more)

Better Preparation and Limits.  Their interpretation unlimits by allowing hundreds of cases that do not reduce restrictions. Negatives will not be prepared with relevant positions and evidence against every possible decrease in the amount of restrictions made available via financial incentives.

Better Clash and Ground.  Minute decreases justify the aff no linking out of disads because they~’re too small to trigger anything.

There is, however, a notable change in Obama~’s style compared to the first 
AND
Obama is more inclined to take the initiative and draw some clear lines.
How the &amp;#34;fiscal cliff&amp;#34; question is managed and ultimately resolved will likely shape the tenor and climate for Obama~’s second-term agenda.   If it leaves a bitter taste, then the rest of Obama~’s domestic priorities will be more difficult to achieve.   If both parties think they gained something in the bargain, prospects for results in other areas will improve.
Not surprisingly, Obama has been explicit that reforming the US~’s shameful and broken immigration 
AND
, there was talk, in both parties, of comprehensive immigration reform.
Despite the sudden optimism about immigration reform, there is, of course, no guarantee that it will happen.    It will require a lot of negotiation and deal-making.  Obama will have to invest a lot of his time and political capital — twisting some arms, even in his own party.   Resistance will not disappear.  
There is also a chance that something unexpected could happen that would put off consideration of immigration reform.   Following the horrific massacre at a Connecticut elementary school on December 14, for example, public pressure understandably mounted for gun control, at least the ban of assault weapons.

B.	Interpretation:  The resolutions demands that the affirmative substantially increase financial incentives for energy production in the United States.

&amp;#34;For&amp;#34; is a limiting term that refers to PURPOSE of the financial incentives:
**Merriam Webster, accessed 2013  ~~http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/for~~**

**&amp;#34;used as **a function word to indicate purpose** a grant for studying medicine&amp;#34;**

**&amp;#34;Production&amp;#34; means the incentives should fund the act or process of transforming inputs into outputs – creation of energy &amp;#34;goods&amp;#34; – process of transformation**
**Patil, 2012  ~~Manoj Patil, Guarav Akrani under guidance of Professor Mudit Katyani, &amp;#34;What is production? Definition meaning transformation process,&amp;#34; Feb. 3, http://kalyan-city.blogspot.com/2012/02/what-is-production-definition-meaning.html~~**

Production is a process of transforming (converting) inputs (raw-materials) into outputs (finished goods). So, production means the creation of goods and services. It is done to satisfy human wants. Thus, production is a process of transformation.

&amp;#34;In the United States&amp;#34; dictates the energy must be created within the 50 states and relevant U.S. territories. 

D.	Violation:  The affirmative incentivizes the purchase of domestically-produced energy, not the production of it.  This means they are FX which is an independent voter 

E.	Standards:
Limits:  Although they may be able to come up with a definition of production that they meet, it does not make it a good, limiting interpretation.  Ours limits out affs that simply pay for energy, while allowing affs that provide incentives to CREATE that energy.
Brightline – the aff has to provide incentives for the PROCESS of TRANSFORMATION not simply the output.  They explode the topic by justifying plans that have the government purchase PRODUCED energy instead of funding PRODUCTION of that energy.

Moots words:  Their interpretation moots the word PRODUCTION from the resolution.  The affirmative simply increases financial incentives for energy, not the PRODUCTION of that energy.  

Plan focus:  Their plan should be the focus of the debate and it does not actually legislate any increase in financial incentives for energy production, but simply purchases electricity IF and WHEN the energy gets produced.

F.	Voter – for reasons of fairness and ground.

There is, however, a notable change in Obama~’s style compared to the first 
AND
Obama is more inclined to take the initiative and draw some clear lines.
How the &amp;#34;fiscal cliff&amp;#34; question is managed and ultimately resolved will likely shape the tenor and climate for Obama~’s second-term agenda.   If it leaves a bitter taste, then the rest of Obama~’s domestic priorities will be more difficult to achieve.   If both parties think they gained something in the bargain, prospects for results in other areas will improve.
Not surprisingly, Obama has been explicit that reforming the US~’s shameful and broken immigration 
AND
, there was talk, in both parties, of comprehensive immigration reform.
Despite the sudden optimism about immigration reform, there is, of course, no guarantee that it will happen.    It will require a lot of negotiation and deal-making.  Obama will have to invest a lot of his time and political capital — twisting some arms, even in his own party.   Resistance will not disappear.  
There is also a chance that something unexpected could happen that would put off consideration of immigration reform.   Following the horrific massacre at a Connecticut elementary school on December 14, for example, public pressure understandably mounted for gun control, at least the ban of assault weapons.   But a decision to pursue that measure — though desperately needed — would take away energy and time from other priorities like immigration.

While some designs are closer to market introduction than others, the fact is that America~’s regulatory and policy environment is not sufficient to support a robust expansion of existing nuclear technologies, much less new ones.
