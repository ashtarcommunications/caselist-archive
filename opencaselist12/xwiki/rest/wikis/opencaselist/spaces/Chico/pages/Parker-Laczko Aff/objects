==== Welcome to the revolution… this is Prescription for the Planet. ====

 

BLEES 2005 Prescription for the planet The Painless Remedy for our Energy and Environmental Crises http:~/~/www.thesciencecouncil.com/pdfs/P4TP4U.pdf

I’d like to invite you to a revolution. Don’t worry, …for the U.S. Department of Energy that the project was not to be publized.

 

==== First, the squo places us on a slow road to collapse ====

==== The idea of easy oil or renewables as a panacea is dangerous – neither will be able to fill our need for energy in the coming years ====

Steffy, 2011.  Loren, business columnist for Houston Chronicle and author, “Drowning in Oil,” fuelfix.com, December 19, http:~~/~~/fuelfix.com/blog/2011/12/19/loren-steffy-the-myths-of-untapped-oil/url:http://fuelfix.com/blog/2011/12/19/loren-steffy-the-myths-of-untapped-oil/

 

Keep in mind that domestic oil production …or unfettered drilling alone can save us, //we risk waiting until it’s too late.//

 

==== The nuclear race is in full swing – global development is inevitable.  ====

 

The energy Collective July 31, 2012 Worldwide Nuclear Energy Expansion Continueshttp:~/~/theenergycollective.com/breakthroughinstitut/98406/worldwide-nuclear-energy-expansion-continues

//Global production of nuclear energy is// expected//…//companies in China announcing their own Gen III reactor designs.&amp;#34;

==== The only question is whether the US will take the lead or slide to the back… ====

==== Hence the plan : The United States Federal government should fund research and development for Integral Fast Reactors including capital investment in a pilot plant. ====

=== The Plan Solves ===

==== Now is key time:  Congressional approval of capital investment for a pilot plant must be done now – delay means the option will be lost ====

 

Steve Kirsch 8/10/2008 The Integral Fast Reactor (IFR) project http:~/~/skirsch.com/politics/globalwarming/ifr.htm

From a risk management point of view, you certainly…we should start very soon, or that option will be lost forever.

==== Congressional action is key – left to its own devices, DOE will just continue to research ====

 

Steve Kirsch 11/25/2009 Why We Should Build an Integral Fast Reactor Now http:~/~/skirsch.wordpress.com/2009/11/25/ifr/

How is it that we need more research today, yet 44 years ago, …will get built. If Congress requests nothing, then that’s what we will get: nothing.

==== The Reactor is Inherently safe – survived Chernobyl and Three Mile Island disaster tests without incident ====

 

Charles E. Till¶ (Adapted from a series of four articles, entitled Plentiful Energy, the IFR Story, and Related Matters, in THE REPUBLIC News and Issues Magazine, June-September 2005. Preface by Terry Robinson.) http:~/~/www.sustainablenuclear.org/PADs/pad0509till.html

The new safety characteristics of the reactor can be summarized …were duplicated, again with a quiet, damage-free shutdown.

== Competitiveness ==

==== Scenario I – China ====

==== The lack of government support for domestic nuclear power is threatening to leave us chasing China in Asian hegemony ====

SCOTT CULLINANE  28 SEPTEMBER 2011 America Falling Behind: The Strategic Dimensions of Chinese Commercial Nuclear Energy http:~~/~~/www.ensec.org/index.php?option=com_contentandview=articleandid=319:america-falling-behind-the-strategic-dimensions-of-chinese-commercial-nuclear-energyandcatid=118:contentandItemid=376url:http://www.ensec.org/index.php?option=com_contentandview=articleandid=319:america-falling-behind-the-strategic-dimensions-of-chinese-commercial-nuclear-energyandcatid=118:contentandItemid=376

While America’s nuclear industry has languished, current …//Nuclear technology provides a clear example of this.//

 

==== And China is doubling down on nuclear power ====

PEOPLE’S DAILY ONLINE, 2011  “China approves 10 more nuclear power generators,” January 26, http:~~/~~/english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90778/90862/7272628.htmlurl:http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90778/90862/7272628.html

China is expected to raise its 2020 target for the nuclear power …power stations, accounting for 50 to 60 percent of the total.

==== A domestic nuclear industry is key to keeping our edge – without it China will outpace us in energy policy creating a shift in the balance of power globally ====

 

SCOTT CULLINANE  28 SEPTEMBER 2011 America Falling Behind: The Strategic Dimensions of Chinese Commercial Nuclear Energy http:~~/~~/www.ensec.org/index.php?option=com_contentandview=articleandid=319:america-falling-behind-the-strategic-dimensions-of-chinese-commercial-nuclear-energyandcatid=118:contentandItemid=376url:http://www.ensec.org/index.php?option=com_contentandview=articleandid=319:america-falling-behind-the-strategic-dimensions-of-chinese-commercial-nuclear-energyandcatid=118:contentandItemid=376

In the context of US – PRC relations, nuclear energy is more than…policy conforms to strategy in order for the US to advance its position.

 

The U.S. is the only thing standing between great power competitions in Asia – arms races, miscalc and all-out conflict would result

Khalilzad, 2011 (Writer of Heg Cards, Feb 8, http:~/~/www.nationalreview.com/author/259022/latest)

 

We face this domestic challenge while other major powers are experiencing rapid …//significant barrier facing Chinese hegemony and aggression.//

==== These conflicts go nuclear ====

UK Defence Forum, 2003  Regional Studies 8: “Conflict In The South China Sea,” Jan 20, 2003 http:~/~/www.ukdf.org.uk/regional/rs8.htm

The oil rich and strategically important Spratly Islands archipelago is one …because //they think they can get away with it//.¶

==== Scenario 2 – Hegemony ====

 

==== The lack of government support for domestic nuclear power destroys US competitiveness ====

 

SCOTT CULLINANE  28 SEPTEMBER 2011 America Falling Behind: The Strategic Dimensions of Chinese Commercial Nuclear Energy http:~~/~~/www.ensec.org/index.php?option=com_contentandview=articleandid=319:america-falling-behind-the-strategic-dimensions-of-chinese-commercial-nuclear-energyandcatid=118:contentandItemid=376url:http://www.ensec.org/index.php?option=com_contentandview=articleandid=319:america-falling-behind-the-strategic-dimensions-of-chinese-commercial-nuclear-energyandcatid=118:contentandItemid=376

 

History has recorded well American wartime nuclear developments which culminated …advancement of the PRC in nuclear energy changes the strategic calculus for America.

 

==== US competitiveness key to maintaining peace – without it we will have frequent crises and major wars – history proves ====

Khalilzad, 2011 (, Feb 8, http:~/~/www.nationalreview.com/author/259022/latest)

 

We face this domestic challenge while other major powers are experiencing rapid economic …States is the most significant barrier facing Chinese hegemony and aggression.

== Dependency ==

 

=== Energy security module ===

 

==== Energy tensions have never been higher  - dependence, unstable regions and competition for resources at most intense level in history ====

 

Merel van den Boomen June 2009 Nuclear Energy in a Changing World of Energy Security and

Global Warming http:~/~/www.iias.nl/epa/files/Merel_van_den_Boomen.pdf

Energy is vital in keeping our planet running, our economy alive…for the safe, secure, and sustainable use of energy worldwide.

 

 

==== IFRs can solve energy security and dwindling supplies for a millennium – it is unrivaled as a solution ====

Barry Brook 24 February 2011  Advanced nuclear power systems to mitigate climate change (Part III) http:~/~/bravenewclimate.com/2011/02/24/advanced-nuclear-power-systems-to-mitigate-climate-change/

Fossil fuels currently supply about 80% of humankind’s primary energy…energy problems facing humanity in the 21st century.

 

==== Energy insecurity is on the brink – geopolitical tensions and new cold wars are forming around conflicts for energy resources ====

Anup Shah, 2011.  “Energy Security,” //Global Issues, // May 15, http:~~/~~/www.globalissues.org/article/595/energy-security#globalissues-orgurl:http://www.globalissues.org/article/595/energy-security#globalissues-org

 

There has certainly been a recognition in recent months and years that //energy security is a …//possibly leading to resource-scarcity driven instability and conflict.

 

 

==== Energy vulnerabilities risk conflicts, economic downturns and a threat to modern life as we know it ====

Journal of Energy Security, 2012.  “From the Editor: Energy Geopolitics in the 21^^st^^ Century,” April 19, http:~~/~~/www.ensec.org/index.php?option=com_contentandview=articleandid=350:energy-geopolitics-in-the-21st-centuryandcatid=122:fromtheditorandItemid=389url:http://www.ensec.org/index.php?option=com_contentandview=articleandid=350:energy-geopolitics-in-the-21st-centuryandcatid=122:fromtheditorandItemid=389

 

In closing, energy geopolitics in the 21st is partially a legacy of how energy has impacted …Ask anyone in the developing world and they’ll answer this for you. 

 

 

 

== Proliferation ==

 

==== Declining share of global energy trade is threatening US leadership on nonproliferation ====

Loudermilk 2011

(Micah, research associate with the Energy and Environmental Security Policy program at National Defense University, “Small Nuclear Reactors and US Energy Security: Concepts, Capabilities, and Costs”, Journal of Energy Security, 5-31-11,

http:~~/~~/www.ensec.org/index.php?view=articleandcatid=116%3Acontent0411andid=314%3Asmall-nuclear-reactors-and-us-energy-security-concepts-capabilities-and-costsandtmpl=componentandprint=1andpage=andoption=com_contentandItemid=375url:http://www.ensec.org/index.php?view=articleandcatid=116%3Acontent0411andid=314%3Asmall-nuclear-reactors-and-us-energy-security-concepts-capabilities-and-costsandtmpl=componentandprint=1andpage=andoption=com_contentandItemid=375, accessed 8-1-12, RSR)

Reactor safety itself notwithstanding, many argue that the scattering of small reactors around … agreements, spent fuel reprocessing, and developing reactor technologies.

 

 

==== Plan restores vibrant nuclear industry needed for global leadership in non-proliferation ====

Dr. Phillip J. Finck, 2005.  Deputy Associate Laboratory Director for Applied Science and Technology and National Security, Argonne National Laboratory, 6-16-05, Before the House Committee on Science, Energy Subcommittee, Hearing on Nuclear Fuel Reprocessing,

 

//The U.S. program represents a transition to an advanced nuclear fuel cycle…us regain international leadership in the field of nuclear energy.//

 

==== In addition, pyroprocessing in IFR makes weapons-usable material technically impossible – it is virtually proliferation-free technology ====

 

Barry Brook 24 February 2011  Advanced nuclear power systems to mitigate climate change (Part III) http:~/~/bravenewclimate.com/2011/02/24/advanced-nuclear-power-systems-to-mitigate-climate-change/

One of the arguments that was used to politically kill the IFR project, just as it was ready to demonstrate … while still condoning aqueous has their facts backward.

 

==== IFRs also solve the need for additional enriched uranium another factor in proliferation ====

 

Barry Brook 16 October 2009 The Integral Fast Reactor – Summary for Policy Makers http:~/~/bravenewclimate.com/2009/10/16/ifr-spm/

Proliferation resistant: The IFR is proliferation resistant on two counts.  //… //into elements that are safe after 300 years.

==== Widespread proliferation leads to massive death and destruction ====

 

Victor A Utgoff, 2002  Deputy Director of Strategy, Forces, and Resources Division of Institute for Defense Analysis, Summer 2002, Survival, p.87-90

In sum, widespread proliferation is likely to lead to an occasional shoot… bodies of dead cities or even whole nations.</headline></objectSummary><objectSummary><link rel="http://www.xwiki.org/rel/object" href="http://opencaselist.paperlessdebate.com/xwiki/rest/wikis/opencaselist/spaces/Chico/pages/Parker-Laczko%20Aff/objects/Admin.EntryClass/1"/><link rel="http://www.xwiki.org/rel/properties" href="http://opencaselist.paperlessdebate.com/xwiki/rest/wikis/opencaselist/spaces/Chico/pages/Parker-Laczko%20Aff/objects/Admin.EntryClass/1/properties"/><id>opencaselist:Chico.Parker-Laczko Aff:794c9bab-9389-446d-aaf7-fcf18fd3afd6</id><guid>794c9bab-9389-446d-aaf7-fcf18fd3afd6</guid><pageId>opencaselist:Chico.Parker-Laczko Aff</pageId><wiki>opencaselist</wiki><space>Chico</space><pageName>Parker-Laczko Aff</pageName><className>Admin.EntryClass</className><number>1</number><headline>&#xD;

&#xD;
Second, is reasons to prefer:&#xD;
(_) A. Aff Choice, any other framework or role of the ballot moots 9 minutes of the 1ac&#xD;
(_) B. It is predictable, the resolution demands USFG action&#xD;
(_) C. It is fair, Weigh Aff Impacts and the method of the Affirmative versus the Kritik, it~’s the only way to test competition and determine the desirability of one strategy over another&#xD;
&#xD;
Finally, It is a voter for competitive equity—prefer our interpretation, it allows both teams to compete, other roles of the ballot are arbitrary and self serving&#xD;

are quick to decide that capitalism is a failure and look for alternatives.&#xD;
So far, such half-hearted experiments not only have failed to work; &#xD;
AND&#xD;
the consequences of a financial crisis than more established firms in wealthier societies.&#xD;
As a result, developing countries and countries where capitalism has relatively recent and shallow roots tend to suffer greater economic and political damage when crisis strikes—as, inevitably, it does. And, consequently, financial crises often reinforce rather than challenge the global distribution of power and wealth. This may be happening yet again.&#xD;
None of which means that we can just sit back and enjoy the recession. &#xD;
AND&#xD;
list of wars is almost as long as the list of financial crises.&#xD;

====Floating pics are bad and a voter:====&#xD;
1. fairness – allows the neg to shift advocacies in the block, mooting all of the 2AC~’s strategy&#xD;
2. education – bad debate&#xD;

====Nuclear power solves blackouts and is critical to the stability of the energy grid ====
Marvin **Fertel, 2004**  Senior Vice President of the Nuclear Energy Institute, 2004, Utility Fleet Management, Vol 23, issue 3, Project Muse)

Nuclear plants provide voltage support because reactor operators can raise or lower power levels as 
AND
played a significant role in expeditiously restoring power to customers in these areas. 


====Black Outs will permanently cripple the US economy                                                                             ====
**United Press International, 2003**   8/18/03

In the end, Bush would learn it was the largest electric blackout ever. 
AND
U.S. economic and social survival may rely upon correcting the difficulties

From these developments, one could conclude that the global economic system is inherently flawed

**Zizek, Professor at the European Graduate School, 9**

====The very first card we read is tagged as welcome to the revolution. Blees makes this abundantly clear. Our plan is the revolution that the capitalist structure would like to see happen fighting back against the oppressive nature of the typical energy secor and using what capitalisim has already thrown away====



====8. We control uniqueness – free market growth solves global poverty and inequality====
**Frieden 10** – Jeffrey, Professor of Government at Harvard; researches international monetary and financial relations ~~Mar 6, http://www.hceronline.com/?q=node/48-http://www.hceronline.com/?q=node/48~~

The good news about global inequality is that it has been declining. The world

First, prosperous countries influence the legal foundations for capitalism or economic policies elsewhere. 
AND
Economic openness or export orientation is part of the package of economic freedom.

====15. Total rejection of capitalism fragments resistance ====
**Gibson-Graham, prof of human geography @ Australian National University, 96**
(J.K. Gibson-Graham, Professor of Human Geography at the Australian National University and Professor of Geosciences at the University of Massachusates, Amherst, 1996 (The End of Capitalism (As We Know It))

One of our goals as Marxists has been to produce a knowledge of capitalism.  
AND
its unity a fantasy, visible as a denial of diversity and change.


====16. Collapse of capitalism causes extinction – outweighs other extinction scenarios====
Jean-Francois Revel, 1993 Sociopolitical analyst
Democracy Against Itself: The Future of the Democratic Impulse
There have been¶ natural cataclysms¶ in history, epidemics, droughts, earthquakes
AND
excessively heavy punishment for them. And anyway it has been tried already.


====17. Alt fails—can~’t change everyone~’s minds====

**Mead 09** - Senior Fellow in U.S. Foreign Policy at the Council on Foreign Relations  (Walter Russell, The New Republic, &amp;#34;Only Makes You Stronger&amp;#34;, 2/4/09)

But, in many other countries where capitalism rubs people the wrong way, this 
AND
are quick to decide that capitalism is a failure and look for alternatives.
So far, such half-hearted experiments not only have failed to work; 
AND
the consequences of a financial crisis than more established firms in wealthier societies.
As a result, developing countries and countries where capitalism has relatively recent and shallow roots tend to suffer greater economic and political damage when crisis strikes—as, inevitably, it does. And, consequently, financial crises often reinforce rather than challenge the global distribution of power and wealth. This may be happening yet again.
None of which means that we can just sit back and enjoy the recession. 
AND
list of wars is almost as long as the list of financial crises.


====Risk of nuclear storage outweighs all – the consequences are so big it doesn~’t matter how low the risk is, we must avoid it====
David **Comarow, 2001**  Dir. Legal Affairs and General Counsel at FortuNet, Inc and COO and General Counsel at Austine Studios 2001, Testimony presented at US Department of Energy Public Hearing 12-8-2001, http://www.nuclearfiles.org/menu/key-issues/nuclear-energy/issues/yucca-mountain/yucca-mountain-testimony-comarow_2001-12-08.htm

None of that is impossible, and therefore none of that is unthinkable. We 
AND
cannot create unnecessary catastrophic risks like biosphereicide, the agonizing death of billions.

Whereas these EIA subsidy reports discussed the scope of Federal energy subsidies and attempted to 
AND
an assessment of the aggregate impact of the various programs for promoting renewable energy

A.	WE MEET Their Interpretation.  The affirmative is 



====REASONS TO PREFER====

====1.  LIMITS====
Their interpretation hurts aff creativity by tying us down to nothing but leasing and subsidy cases, which would mean 12 cases for a years worth of debate.  We give the neg good notice that they need to be able to defend government regulation of energy producers.

====2.  GROUND====
Their interpretation will lead to a boring year of debate only about the merits of increasing energy supply.  No other topic in recent memory had only a single advantage area within it.  Our interpretation gives them links to nuclear, energy, politics, and financial incentives 

====3.  BRIGHT LINE ====
We provide a clear brightline for a financial incentive. Cross apply the Gielikie. 

E. NOT A VOTER FOR REASONS PREVIOUSLY STATED
 



====US system of hegemony is sustainable because the US disproportionally benefits – trade, economy, and security====
Norrlof, 10 Associate Professor in the Department of Political Science at the University of Toronto, Carla, America~’s Global Advantage; US Hegemony and International Cooperation, Cambridge University Press, p. 1-4
In sketching my argument, I will show that the United States gains both materially

Mearsheimer, 2002.  ~~professor of Political Science at U Chicago, John, &amp;#34;Realism, the Real World, and the Academy&amp;#34;, Realism and Institutionalism in International Studies, p. 23-33~~
There is little reason to think that such hostility toward realism will subside anytime soon
AND
students will continue to be impressed by realism~’s compelling explanations of state behavior.
Realism will disappear only if there is a revolutionary change in the structure of the international system, but that is not likely to happen anytime soon.

====And. realism is transformative—it can synthesize critical theories to provide effective strategies of change====
Alastair J.H. Murray, Politics Department, University of Wales Swansea, Reconstructing Realism, 1997, p. 178-9
In Wendt~’s constructivism, the argument appears in its most basic version, presenting an 
AND
of rationalism and reflectivism, of conservatism and progressivism, might be built.

====Permutation – do the plan as an engagement with realism while adopting the critical alternative in other instances of international relations – this is necessary to move beyond the squo they criticize====

Guzzini, 1998 ~~Senior Research Fellow at the Copenhagen Peace Research Institute and Associate Professor of Political Science, International Relations, and European Studies at the Central European University in Budapest, 1998~~ (&amp;#34;Realism in International Relations and International Political Economy: The Continuing Story of a Death Foretold&amp;#34; p. 109- 235)
When all has been said and done, what is left of realism? For

====Perm – critiquing security rhetoric is not enough – action is essential====
Anthony Burke, Prof at the School of Political Science and International Studies at University of Queensland, Alternatives &amp;#34;Aporias of Security&amp;#34; 2002 p. 22
It is perhaps easy to become despondent, but as countless struggles for freedom,

====First Our interpretation is that the affirmative should be able to weigh the advantages of the plan PERIOD The negative can have a competitive policy option or a disadvantage or critical impact that may be uniquely caused by the affirmative The Role of ballot is to say yes or no to the action and outcomes of the plan.====

Second, is reasons to prefer:
(_) A. Aff Choice, any other framework or role of the ballot moots 9 minutes of the 1ac
(_) B. It is predictable, the resolution demands USFG action
(_) C. It is fair, Weigh Aff Impacts and the method of the Affirmative versus the Kritik, it~’s the only way to test competition and determine the desirability of one strategy over another

Finally, It is a voter for competitive equity—prefer our interpretation, it allows both teams to compete, other roles of the ballot are arbitrary and self serving

Ronald E. ~*~*Santoni 85~*~*, Phil. Prof @ Denison, Nuclear War, ed. Fox and Groarke, p. 156-7

To be sure, Fox sees the need for our undergoing &amp;#34;certain fundamental changes

Given our need for a paradigm shift in our (distorted) understanding of ourselves and the rest of

Despite Zimmerman~~’s elaborations and refinements his Heideggerian notion of &amp;#34;letting beings be&amp;#34;

continues to be too permissive in this regard.  In my judgment, an individual~~’s

Heidegger and Foucault are clear, then, that what is uniquely oppressive in our

The blackmail inherent in the choice offered by Der Derian and Chaloupka, between total critique and &amp;#34;ineffective&amp;#34; partial critique, ought to be transparent. Among other things, it effectively militates against the construction of provisional or strategic essentialism in our attempts to create space for an activist politics. In the next section, I focus more widely on the genre of critical international theory and its impact on such an activist politics.

Their interpretation hurts aff creativity by tying us down to nothing but leasing and subsidy cases, which would mean 12 cases for a years worth of debate.  We give the neg good notice that they need to be able to defend government regulation of energy producers.

 

~====2.  GROUND====

Their interpretation will lead to a boring year of debate only about the merits of increasing energy supply.  No other topic in recent memory had only a single advantage area within it.  Our interpretation gives them links to nuclear, energy, politics, and financial incentives

To be sure, Fox sees the need for our undergoing &amp;#34;certain fundamental changes

Despite Zimmerman~~’s elaborations and refinements his Heideggerian notion of &amp;#34;letting beings be&amp;#34;

Heidegger and Foucault are clear, then, that what is uniquely oppressive in our

Perm: do the plan and all other instances of the alt – that creates a double bind: either the plan singularly can be solved by the detachment process, or the alternative doesn~~’t have the ability to solve the thousands of scenarios of technological ontology in the squo.

 

Technological ontology is inevitable – man inherently uses technology to exploit things around him – at worst theres no specific brink to the 1AC that causes the impact that nuclear testing, and mining before wouldn~~’t have caused making the impact non-unique at best

So Heidegger~~’s exploration of the question of Being will therefore be an exploration of the

not limited only to the way that the self relates with the self.

~*~*Eldred 9~*~* (Michael, Univ of Sydney, Left Curve, no 24, http:~/~/www.arte-fact.org/capiteen.html.)

Steve **Kirsch** 11/25/**2009 **Why We Should Build an Integral Fast Reactor Now http://skirsch.wordpress.com/2009/11/25/ifr/
Nuclear is our best clean power technology and the IFR is our best nuclear technology

Also this technology exisits and was in development until the 90’s
 


REASONS TO PREFER
1.  LIMITS
Their interpretation hurts aff creativity by tying us down to nothing but leasing and subsidy cases, which would mean 12 cases for a years worth of debate.  We give the neg good notice that they need to be able to defend government regulation of energy producers.
2.  GROUND
Their interpretation will lead to a boring year of debate only about the merits of increasing energy supply.  

3. we are reasonably topical

We provide a clear brightline for a financial incentive. Cross apply the Gielikie. 

E. NOT A VOTER FOR REASONS PREVIOUSLY STATED
 

Frame work

Limits are necessary to sustain nonviolent debate 
Graham 99 (Philip School of Communication Queensland University of Technology, Heidegger’s Hippies Sep 15 http://www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Palms/8314/index.html)
Politics has historically been about how people can best live together. Today’s politics is 
AND
public before it is prised open, once again, by mass annihilations.

Apolitical theorizing exists only in the ivory tower and fails to persuade anyone or change anything
Lepgold and Nincic 1 (Joesph, associate professor of Government at Georgetown and Miroslav professor of Poly Sci at UC-Davis, Beyond the Ivory Tower: International Relations Theory and the Issue of Policy Relevance pg. 2-4)JFS
For many reasons, connections between scholarly ideas and policymakers’ thinking in international relations are 
AND
on international relations and foreign policy can be useful beyond the Ivory Tower.
Theorizing is a direct trade-off with political action – that causes a resurgence of the genocidal atrocities of the 20th century
Wolin 4  (Richard, distinguished professor of intellectual history at Graduate Center, City University of New York, The Seduction of Unreason: the intellectual romance with fascism from Nietzsche to Postmodernism, pg. 8-9)JFS
The Seduction of Unreason is an exercise in intellectual genealogy. It seeks to shed 
AND
which the poststructuralists had emphatically denounced, seemed to merit a second look.
Turn – failing to recognize and act within the inevitable state system endangers survival – the moral absolutism of the K proves self-destructive
Murray, 1997.  Professor of Politics at the University of Wales, Alastair J.H., Reconstructing Realism: Between Power Politics and Cosmopolitan Ethics, p. 75-76

The central tenet of a realist approach in this respect is that each system of 
AND
a bloody cycle of ineffectively executed attempts to block such domination.&amp;#39;&amp;#34;


Justice

pdb
The framing of environmental questions is crucial to finding cooperative, pragmatic solutions

Norton 3 (Bryan, Prof. of Philosophy, Science, and Technology at School of Public Policy, Georgia Institute of Technology, Fall 2003, Environs, 27 Environs Envtl. L. and Pol&amp;#39;y J. 81)
If environmentalists can pass through the Age of Ideology and enter an Age of Pluralism 
AND

We must use science to confront issues like environmental justice

High-Level Nuclear Waste Siting Decisions  http://www.ejconference.net/images/Endres.pdf
Finally, because nuclear waste siting decisions fall into the larger conversation ¶ about environmental 
AND
, including the state of environmental justice in nuclear waste siting ¶ decisions. 


Altering consumptive patterns and revitalizing environmentalism requires specific political plans – that form of politics is a prerequisite to social transformation.

Lewis 92 (Martin professor in the School of the Environment and the Center for International Studies at Duke University. Green Delusions, 1992 p11-12)
Here I will argue that eco-radical political strategy, if one may call 
AND
political plans must be devised if those policies are ever to be realized.

Consequences can be assessed, despite their critique of our epistemology – any chance we’re right about our predictions of the future is a reason to prefer the plan to doing nothing

Cowen 6 (Tyler, GMU, December 2006, “The Epistemic Problem Does Not Refute Consequentialism,” Utilitas, 18:4, proquest)
The epistemic critique relies heavily on a complete lack of information about initial circumstances. 
AND
uncertainty should not stop us from pursuing large upfront benefits of obvious importance.

Environmental pragmatism can use cost-benefit analysis without letting it control policymaking

Mintz 4 (Joel, Prof. of Law, Nova Southeastern Univ. and Scholar at Center for Progressive Regulation; 2004, Boston College Environmental Affairs Law Review, 31 B.C. Envtl. Aff. L. Rev. 1)
Farber argues for the inclusion of an environmental &amp;#34;baseline&amp;#34; in policymaking, i
AND
however, we should avoid making &amp;#34;hard social decisions on spreadsheets.&amp;#34; 116  

Even a very small risk we’re right is a reason to vote aff – limited information about the future is enough to tip the consequentialist balance

Cowen 6 (Tyler, GMU, December 2006, “The Epistemic Problem Does Not Refute Consequentialism,” Utilitas, 18:4, Proquest)
Lenman’s example assumes that we know literally nothing about the major consequences of our acts
AND
non-quantifiable, as to which beach is better for the invasion.


And, technological thought is inevitable and necessary for achieving a communicative state.

Feenberg 96 (Andrew, Chair of Philosophy and Technology at SFU. 1996. “From Essentialism to Constructivism: Philosophy of Technology at the Crossroads” http://www.agora.qc.ca/textes/feenberg.html)
From this anti-essentialist standpoint, our form of modern society cannot be the 
AND
technological designing is ontological designing (Winograd and Flores, 1987: 163). 

And, the ambivalent nature of technology must be embraced in some forms to achieve the multitude of potentialities that form a progressive approach to being and the world

Feenberg 96 (Andrew, Chair of Philosophy and Technology at SFU. 1996. “From Essentialism to Constructivism: Philosophy of Technology at the Crossroads” http://www.agora.qc.ca/textes/feenberg.html)
The idea of a &amp;#34;concrete technology,&amp;#34; which includes human beings and nature in 
AND
needed is an account of technology&amp;#39;s ambivalence as a locus of social change. 

It’s impossible to determine an answer to being – ontological questioning results in an infinite regress and total paralysis

Levinas and Nemo 85 (Emmanuel, professor of philosophy, and Philippe, professor of new philosophy, Ethics and Infinity, 1985, pg. 6-7)
Are we not in need of still more precautions? Must we not step back 
AND
, in its inability to escape itself, to escape being and essence.

Value to life can’t be measured externally – we must preserve life to give people autonomy

Shwartz 2 (L. “A Value to Life: Who Decides and How?” Medical ethics: a case-based approach 2002 www.fleshandbones.com/readingroom/pdf/399.pdf)
Those who choose to reason on this basis hope that if the quality of a

Paradox of risk 

Perm: Do Both

they do not have impacts if this k is true because their claims are all about link chains to get to them as well. 
If the alternative can overcome the status quo it can overcome the plan 
Perm: Do the plan and all portions of the alternative that don’t require rejection of the plan 
Voting for prediction is an act which reclaims the future for the forces of pragmatic political change – the reason our social field is ruled by futurism and destructive risk management is precisely the negative’s cynical evasion of the potentiality in prediction.  Theorizing about the system sparks ideas on how to overcome it.

Kurasawa 4 (Fuyuki, Constellation, v. 11, no. 4, 2004, “Cautionary Tales,” Blackwell)
As we float in a mood of post-millennial angst, the future appears 
AND
dystopian imaginary can lay the foundations for a constructive engagement with the future. 
We’re not the kind of futurism they criticize – we embrace preventive foresight, which allows us to have a responsibility to avoid catastrophe and not collapse into meaningless political posturing.  Even if none of us have our hands on the levers of power, there’s inherent utility in publically debating in forums like these over issues of the future – voting affirmative completes the circle on this dialogic process, sparking transnational movements which can help prevent catastrophes in the real world

Kurasawa 4 (Fuyuki, Constellation, v. 11, no. 4, 2004, “Cautionary Tales,” Blackwell)
Rather than bemoaning the contemporary preeminence of a dystopian imaginary, I am claiming that 
AND
to public deliberation about the construction of an alternative world order (IV). 

Even if traditional paradigms of prediction are flawed, there’s value to discussing our advantages

Kurasawa 4 (Fuyuki, Constellation, v. 11, no. 4, 2004, “Cautionary Tales,” Blackwell)
When engaging in the labor of preventive foresight, the first obstacle that one is 
AND
anticipate and prepare for possible and avoidable sources of harm to our successors.   
The critique is self-defeating, because it only appeals to those that already agree with the framework.  Only appeals to empiricism are capable of making demands on traditional forms of knowledge production in a way that enables the alternative

Wagner 2k (Joseph, Poly Sci Prof @ Colgate, 5-2-2000, “The Revolt Against Reason,” in Critical Thinking, ed. Oxman-Michelli and Weinstein, http://hascall.colgate.edu/jwagner/DownloadFiles/Revolt.doc)
In this paper I have tried to show that the relativist fails to appreciate the 
AND
and political program that is as foolish as it is imprudent and unwise.  
Their relativist suspicion of our empirical methodology is totally indefensible – reason is true, even if human’s don’t have access to absolute objectivity

Wagner 2k (Joseph, Poly Sci Prof @ Colgate, 5-2-2000, “The Revolt Against Reason,” in Critical Thinking, ed. Oxman-Michelli and Weinstein, http://hascall.colgate.edu/jwagner/DownloadFiles/Revolt.doc)
There is an affinity between critical thinking and relativism, which, on its face
AND
to honor prescriptions for equality, justice, and the mutuality of respect.  
Their post-structuralist rejection of truth and reason is just code for ethical relativism – the plan is key to any consensus on ethics

Jarvis 2k (D.S.L., Lecturer in IR at the University of Sydney, International Relations and the Challenges of Postmodernism, 2000, p. 130-131)
While the relevance of Ashley’s poststructuralist theory is cause for concern, more disconcerting is 
AND
the answer is a resounding “yes, yes, yes, yes.”

Paths of glory


First, policy analysis should precede discourse – most effective way to challenge power
Jill Taft-Kaufman, Speech prof @ CMU, 1995, Southern Comm. Journal, Spring, v. 60, Iss. 3, “Other Ways”, p pq
The postmodern passwords of &amp;#34;polyvocality,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Otherness,&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;difference,&amp;#34; unsupported

and, realism is epistemologically true
Frank Harvey, associate professor of Political Science, Dalhouse University, The Future’s Back: Nuclear Rivalry, Deterrence Theory, And Crisis Stability After The Cold War, 1997, p. 139
Finally, the lack of purity and precision, another consequence of linguistic relativism, 
AND
would know more or less about international relations if we pursued that strategy.
Realism is inevitable in a world where it accurately describes international politics

Mearsheimer, 2002.  professor of Political Science at U Chicago, John, “Realism, the Real World, and the Academy”, Realism and Institutionalism in International Studies, p. 23-33
There is little reason to think that such hostility toward realism will subside anytime soon
AND
students will continue to be impressed by realism&amp;#39;s compelling explanations of state behavior.
Realism will disappear only if there is a revolutionary change in the structure of the international system, but that is not likely to happen anytime soon.

=NU RD2 VS IOWA=


==A2 Topicality – Not an Incentive for Production==


A.	COUNTERINTERPRETATION 


====A financial incentive is : A tax credit, production payment, trust fund, low cost loans and research and development====

Mark **Gielecki**, Fred **Mayes**, and Lawrence **Prete** February **2001** Incentives, Mandates, and Government Programs for Promoting Renewable Energy http://lobby.la.psu.edu/_107th/128_PURPA/Agency_Activities/EIA/Incentive_Mandates_and_Government.htm
A financial incentive is defined in this report as providing one or more of the 
AND
the commercial viability of the good(s) provided. (4)


====RandD is a financial incentive because is integral to the development of emerging energy technologies====

Mark **Gielecki**, Fred **Mayes**, and Lawrence **Prete** February **2001** Incentives, Mandates, and Government Programs for Promoting Renewable Energy http://lobby.la.psu.edu/_107th/128_PURPA/Agency_Activities/EIA/Incentive_Mandates_and_Government.htmd
Whereas these EIA subsidy reports discussed the scope of Federal energy subsidies and attempted to 
AND
an assessment of the aggregate impact of the various programs for promoting renewable energy

B.	WE MEET Their Interpretation.  The affirmative is a direct financial incentive for energy production:
1.	Research and development is a financial incentive. We clarify that in the plan text through the capital investment in a pilot plant
2.	They ignore the specific funding for the pilot plant – it~’s direct funding for development which means we are NOT FX TOPICAL, funding a pilot plant is ACTUALLY a direct incentive for energy production from that new reactor



====REASONS TO PREFER====

====1.  LIMITS====
Their interpret over limits because it means new technology could never be topical – we would have stale debates all year about old conventional nuclear technology instead of discussing newer kinds of reactors that are more relevant to topic education because it is the energy of the future. 

====2.  GROUND====
Our interpretation gives them links to nuclear, energy, politics, and financial incentives 
POTENTIAL ABUSE IS NOT A VOTER – make them prove ground loss.  We will defend reasonable links to financial incentives and increased nuclear energy production.  They don~’t have a reason to vote neg. 

3. REASONABILITY
We are reasonably topical – we defend that the USFG should provide a financial incentive and we defend that energy would be produced.  If you google nuclear reactor, you will most certainly find information about IFR~’s.  Good enough is good enough – if you can read specific case evidence and links to your off case arguments then we are reasonably topical.  

4. Competing interpretations are bad
Force judge intervention and cause a race to the bottom.  They don~’t actually think we are untopical, they are just trying to limit out one more aff. 

5. LIT CHECKS ABUSE 1ac evidence refers to the need for government incentives for production of new nuclear energy. Cross apply the Kirsch evidence. 

E. NOT A VOTER FOR REASONS PREVIOUSLY STATED
 



==Case==


====Nuclear power coming - US specific ====
**de Rugy, ~’12**
Veronique de Rugy, Ph.D., is a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University and a monthly columnist for the print edition of reason.: &amp;#34;No to Nukes Nuclear power isn~’t cost-effective, no matter how you do the math. - Reason.com.&amp;#34; Reason, July 2012. http://reason.com/archives/2012/06/25/no-to-nukes-http://reason.com/archives/2012/06/25/no-to-nukes ~~TP
Surprising as it may seem, the United States still generates around 20 percent of 
AND
-starting nuclear power is not just bad politics. It~’s awful economics.


==Coal==


====Our aff says that they are already investing in nuclear tech means its about us catching up to prevent the impacts. Chin realizes that they don~’t need to have the resources to be able to maintain ====


====IFR~’s can use the coal infrastructure already in place making it attractive to business====

====Solvency deficiet- the cp doesn~’t solve for heg. It doesn~’t make sense for the states to independently fund research. The states also don~’t fund the DOE means they can~’t build the pilot plant. ====


States CP illegit:
1. Multi-actor fiat bad:  Infinitely regressive – This justifies doing actions through Counties, Cities, etc.  No limits.  It is also particular egregious in this instance because we do one pilot test plant not a national plan requiring uniform action in the 50 states. 
2. Utopian:  There are no examples of all 50 states acting in a uniform way on any issue and none of their solvency assumes 50 states agreeing to a build one singular pilot plant amongst the 50.  
3. Lit check:  We have evidence saying the congress needs to act on this issue – they can~’t claim to capture our solvency without evidentiary support.
4.  Links to politics:  The signal sent by 50 states acting in unison would be that someone had to convince them to do so – Obama would still take the hit for this.  


Solvency deficit:  the cp isn~’t through a federal government actor, so it would not include NRC approval – the plan has the Congress approve a pilot plant which fast tracks NRC approval because it is a federal agency – the CP can~’t do that.  


Timeframe:  Getting the 50 states to agree on the pilot plant and approve building, etc. could take years.  Too much bureaucracy would lead to inaction.

2.  Destroys argumentative responsibility:
They should be held accountable for the arguments they make – this justifies kicking out of advantages that are turned or kicking portions of the affirmative plan in later speeches.

3.  Moving target:  
We have no idea what we need to refute until the 2NR.  At a minimum, you should give huge leeway to the affirmative because you know what we are defending throughout the round.  

6. Infinitely regressive:
This creates a world where there is no check on negatives running multiple contradictory arguments up to the 2NR.  This explodes the ground available to the negative, destroying competitive equity.

The biggest fight on immigration reform will be over a pathway to citizenship. Many House Republicans have said they might support a middle ground that would allow undocumented immigrants to stay in the U.S., but not to become citizens. Only 10 percent of American voters support such a plan, while 56 percent believe the undocumented should be allowed to eventually become citizens, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released Thursday.

The Department of Energy under Obama has provided billions of dollars in federal loan guarantees for nuclear-power development, as well as wind and other &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; energy sources. In February, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved two new reactors at the Vogtle Electric Generating Plant in Georgia, the first such construction approvals in three decades.

Continuing fiscal cliff battles: One consequence of not reaching a grand bargain on the fiscal cliff is that it ensures that further contests over how to resolve the nation~’s ongoing deficits will suck much of the oxygen out of the most opportune time slot for legislative action: the period immediately following the president~’s inaugural address and the State of the Union address.

====They assume traditional debate to be some form of &amp;#34;grand theory&amp;#34; which its not – our approach does not EXCLUDE their approach, but they seem to be advocating to exclude OUR approach.  ====
Martin, 2001 ~~Brian, Professor of Social Sciences at U. of Woolongong, Australia,&amp;#34;Review of Popular Dissent, Human Agency and Global Politics, by Ronald Bleiker,&amp;#34; Social Alternatives, January, http://www.bmartin.cc/pubs/01BRsa.html-http://www.bmartin.cc/pubs/01BRsa.html~~:

Bleiker argues for acceptance of contingent foundations, saying that &amp;#34;grand theories of dissent run the risk of objectifying and entrenching forms of domination&amp;#34; (p. 140). I am sceptical that theories of dissent - such as the consent theory of power - have such an influence on dissent itself. Many contemporary activists are far more flexible than the stereotype of the dogmatic Marxist. Grand theories are more commonly used as resources than as straitjackets.



====*** Role-playing as public actors shatters apathy and political alienation, which is critical to check inequality and exploitation====

Mitchell 2K (Gordon, Director of Debate and Professor of Communication – U. Pittsburgh, Argumentation and Advocacy, Vol. 36, No. 3, Winter)
When we assume the posture of the other in dramatic performance, we tap into 
AND
that highlight this component of students~’ self-identities carry significant emancipatory potential.



====Theory can impact policymakers, but only if it focuses on practical policy issues====

Lepgold and Nincic 10 (Joesph, associate professor of Government at Georgetown and Miroslav professor of Poly Sci at UC-Davis, Beyond the Ivory Tower: International Relations Theory and the Issue of Policy Relevance pg. 11-12)
In some areas, foreign-policymakers have been deeply influenced by the theoretical literature 
AND
scholars in this field tend to write almost exclusively for their own colleagues.


==Case==

===Comp===

====Nothing about this argument has made an argument about personal before life. This means that our conceded impact on this flow is not only true but also will kill us all. Nuclear war mutes the personal. ====


===Waste===


====They drop our waste advantage which is not about my knowledge production. They also say that I havnt listened to the communities. However you have not you have assumed that we have no because of where this reactor will go. There is already a facility at the river savannah site. Those harms. However not doing this reverts us back to Yucca. That~’s the government decisions the law argument. We reverse that trend====

====the status quo where nuclear technolongy will continue to dump on the native lands. The aff is a dramatic policy shift that reverses this trend. First we are able to use this technology to reprocess the nuclear waste and second it prevents us from having to continue to mine for these resources on native lands====

====They history of nuclear colonialism spans decades – killing natives, supporting cooperations and exploitation of lands are an all too common occurance====

 Danielle **Endres** 01 March **2009** The Rhetoric of Nuclear Colonialism: Rhetorical Exclusion of American Indian Arguments in the Yucca Mountain Nuclear Waste Siting Decision Publisher

Before attending to the rhetorical nature of nuclear colonialism, it is important to emphasize 
AND
people living near tailing piles at a high risk for lung cancer. 10


====Yucca Mountain is just one example of the transparently racist policies directed at Native Americans. It is time to reverse this trend and invest in better nuclear.====

Bayley **Lopez**, Septmeber 1, **2004** Radioactive Reservations The Uphill Battle to Keep Nuclear Waste Off Native American Land https://www.wagingpeace.org/articles/2004/09/01_lopez_radioactive-reservations.htm
Yucca Mountain is just one more example to add to the list of the United 
AND
to reverse this trend, beginning with the government~’s policies on nuclear waste.


====IFRS ARE OUR BEST NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY – REVERSES THE TREND OF VIIOLENCE AND WASTE DISPOSAL ON NATIVE LANDS By eating the waste previously dumped====


===Kriticisim===


====First, policy analysis should precede discourse – most effective way to challenge power====
Jill Taft-Kaufman, Speech prof @ CMU, 1995, Southern Comm. Journal, Spring, v. 60, Iss. 3, &amp;#34;Other Ways&amp;#34;, p pq
The postmodern passwords of &amp;#34;polyvocality,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Otherness,&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;difference,&amp;#34; unsupported 
AND
political agendas, institutions, agencies, and the budgets that fuel them. 

Arguing about what governments ought to do is not the same as complicity with the existing order
Dower 10 
(Nigel, Senior Lecturer in Philosophy at the University of Aberdeen, Scotland, former President of the International Development Ethics Association &amp;#34;Questioning the Questioning of Cosmopolitanism,&amp;#34; in Questioning Cosmopolitanism, p. 14)
Ethical cosmopolitanism does not merely apply to individuals; it is also applied to the 
AND
on creating the conditions for the general realization of human well-being.


====This debate matters – use the aff to stand in solidarity with the plan as a method to resist the possibility of nuclear war – ====
HNSG (Harvard Nuclear Study Group – Albert Carnesale, UCLA Chancellor Emeritus and holds 
AND
Freeman Spogli Institute) 1983 &amp;#34;Living With Nuclear Weapons&amp;#34; p. 10
Many citizens who are concerned about nuclear weapons policy, however, are deterred from 
AND
, role in maintaining American Security.  This is true in two ways.  



====Even if it doesn~’t we still have an obligation to begin with questions of policy-making====
jenny Edkins and maja Zehfuss1 Review of International Studies (2005), 31,p. 454-5
What we are attempting in this article is an intervention that demonstrates how the illusion 
AND
and how it might look to think about politics and the international differently.



====Localized visions of politics collapse all political horizons and inevitably lead to passivity – only embracing localized fictions of large scale political action can move us forward and fight the existing power structure====
Charlie Bertsch (Ph.D. , English at UC-Berkeley) 1995 &amp;#34;Useful Fictions&amp;#34; Bad Subjects Online Journal Issue ~~#19 http://bad.eserver.org/issues/1995/19/bertsch.html
Obviously, if we agree that an individual~’s will is constructed by social forces, 
AND
a collective movement; fictions, finally, that are worth believing in.


===Zompetti===

====The affirmative approach stifles dissent and serves to deflect attention from the structural problems underlying inequality in debate – critical self-reflection is the exception, not the rule, in reaction to these types of arguments when presented in debate rounds====
**ZOMPETTI 04** Assistant Professor, School of Communication, Illinois State University 
~~Joseph Zompetti, PERSONALIZING DEBATING: DIVERSITY AND TOLERANCE IN THE DEBATE COMMUNITY, Contemporary Argumentation and Debate, September~~ 


 The second major problem with this turn in contemporary policy debate is its¶ 
AND
nothing except breed frustration, victimage, and displacement of more lofty efforts.¶ 




====The alternative would fail because of its localized focus  – must both DESCRIBE problems in the world and DO something about those problems====
COOK IN 1992 ~~Anthony E. Cook, Associate Professor at Georgetown Law School, &amp;#34;Reflections on Postmodernism&amp;#34;, 26 New Eng.L. Rev. 751, Spring of 1992; L/N~~ 

Several things trouble me about Foucault~’s approach. First, he nurtures in many ways 
AND
to say and do something about the oppressive world in which we live.


====Discursive focus trades off with focus on structural change—it becomes a psychological substitute for action.====
**Kidner 2k** – psychology professor, David, Nature and Psyche, p 66-7
Noam Chomsky has noted that if &amp;#34;it~’s too hard to deal with real problems
AND
&amp;#34;human&amp;#34; from the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and abandons nature to industrialism. 



**====The negative reentrenches the Black/White paradigm – ignoring all other races in regards to treatment in debate and beyond====**
**Perea, ~’97** ~~Juan F., Florida Prof of Law., California Law Review, October, 1997, 85 Calif. L. Rev. 1213~~

Paradigms of race shape our understanding of race and our definition of racial problems.  
AND
, this just restates the binary paradigm with a slight concession to demographics.


====This turns the case by preventing understanding of issues of race and ethnicity – renders solvency for their harms limited at best and impossible at worst====
Fransisco **Valdes, 97**  visiting professor of law @ University of Miami, &amp;#34;Under Construction – LatCrit Consciousness, Community, and Theory&amp;#34;, CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW, October 1997, page lexis

The predominance of this paradigm in legal and social thought thus must be well understood 
AND
pull of essentializing customs and frameworks, including the Black/White paradigm.




=NU RD8 VS MACALESTER=


==Framework==

====First Our interpretation is that the affirmative should be able to weigh the advantages of the plan PERIOD The negative can have a competitive policy option or a disadvantage or critical impact that may be uniquely caused by the affirmative The Role of ballot is to say yes or no to the action and outcomes of the plan.====

====Theorizing is a direct trade-off with political action – that causes a resurgence of the genocidal atrocities of the 20th century====
Wolin 4  (Richard, distinguished professor of intellectual history at Graduate Center, City University of New York, The Seduction of Unreason: the intellectual romance with fascism from Nietzsche to Postmodernism, pg. 8-9)JFS
The Seduction of Unreason is an exercise in intellectual genealogy. It seeks to shed 
AND
which the poststructuralists had emphatically denounced, seemed to merit a second look.


====Extinction precedes ontology – existence is a prerequisite for the self ====
Wapner 3 ~~Paul Wapner is associate professor and director of the Global Environmental Policy Program at American University, DISSENT / Winter 2003~~JFS
All attempts to listen to nature are, indeed, social constructions, except one
AND
-critics must be supporters, in some fashion, of environmental preservation.

Ecopolitics must come to terms with the scramble for resources that increasingly dominates the competitive 
AND
development~’s contribution to energy efficiency, battery storage and new forms of renewable energy


====2. Must work within the system to reform it====
**Jones and Spicer 09  **Campbell, Senior Lecturer in the School of Management at U of Leicester, Andre, Associate Professor in the Dept of Industrial Relations @ Warwick Business School U of Warwick, Unmasking the Entrepreneur, pgs. 22-23

The third strand in our proposed critical theory of entrepreneurship involves questions of the ~’extra

====Case is a disad to the k. capitalisim is key to generate capital investment and kirsh 2008 says that has to happen now. At best the k delays action and probably prevent.====

====	5. Perm do the plan and withdraw from all other forms of capital- that puts them in a double bind either the permutation solves or the alternative can~’t overcome the drop in the bucket of the plan====

====6. We shouldn~’t withdraw from the state but engage it – means the perm solves best====
**Zizek, Professor at the European Graduate School, 9**
(Slavoj, &amp;#34;First as Tragedy, Then as Farce,&amp;#34; pg. 130) 
Consequently, I want to propose two axioms concerning the relationship between the state and

Therein resides the key component of the &amp;#34;dictatorship of the proletariat:~’

**Frieden 10** – Jeffrey, Professor of Government at Harvard; researches international monetary and financial relations ~~Mar 6, http://www.hceronline.com/?q=node/48-http://www.hceronline.com/?q=node/48~~

The good news about global inequality is that it has been declining. The world 
AND
of broad and deep global markets for goods, capital, and technology. 


====9. Vauge alts are bad they create a moving target and that~’s not our zizak making it impossible to create offense. And they are bad for education, if they are to question our methodology they need to hav a stable advocacy for us to copare it to letting the bock redefine the alternative is abusive and kills education reasons it~’s a voter for education and fairness====



====10. Rejecting capitalism will spark transition wars, re-entrenching cycles of exploitation ====
**Gubrud 1997** ~~Mark Avrum (Center for Superconductivity Research); &amp;#34;Nanotechnology and International Security&amp;#34;; Foresight Nanotechnology Institute; http://www.foresight.org/Conferences/MNT05/Papers/Gubrud/-http://www.foresight.org/Conferences/MNT05/Papers/Gubrud/
With molecular manufacturing, international trade in both raw materials and finished goods can be 
AND
political loyalty of clients might imply reversion to some form of nationalistic imperialism. 


====11. Capitalism key to technological innovation—helps the environment ====
**Barker, 00** – electrical engineer, and manager of corporate communications for the Electric Power Research Institute and former industrial economist and staff author at SRI International and as a commercial research analyst at USX Corporation (Brent,  &amp;#34;Technology and the Quest for Sustainability.&amp;#34; EPRI Journal, Summer)

The rate of innovation is especially critical to sustainability. The roadmap participants have concluded 
AND
measure to future generations everywhere in the world. That future begins now.


====14 Neoliberalism is inevitable through global pressure====
**Weede,** Professor of Sociology at the University of Bonn, **04** (Erich, &amp;#34;The Diffusion of Prosperity and Peace by Globalization,&amp;#34; The Independent Review, Vol. 9, No. 2, Fall, http://www.independent.org /pdf/tir/tir_09_2_1_weede.pdf)

First, prosperous countries influence the legal foundations for capitalism or economic policies elsewhere. 
AND
Economic openness or export orientation is part of the package of economic freedom.


====16. Collapse of capitalism causes extinction – outweighs other extinction scenarios====
Jean-Francois Revel, 1993 Sociopolitical analyst
Democracy Against Itself: The Future of the Democratic Impulse
There have been¶ natural cataclysms¶ in history, epidemics, droughts, earthquakes
AND
excessively heavy punishment for them. And anyway it has been tried already.


====Don~’t evaluate their ethics in a vacuum-Their moral tunnel vision is complicit with the evil they criticize─====
**Isaac**, 200**2. **(Jeffrey C., James H. Rudy professor of Political Science and director of the Center for the Study of Democracy and Public Life at Indiana University, Bloomington, &amp;#34;Ends, Means and politics,&amp;#34; Dissent, Spring)
As writers such as Niccolo Machiavelli, Max Weber, Reinhold Niebuhr, and Hannah

not true believers. It promotes arrogance. And it undermines political effectiveness. 


====Perm: Do the plan and all portions of the alternative that don~’t require rejection of the plan ====

**Their link arguments take out alt solvency**

**J.K.** **Gibson**-**Graham 96** (J. K. Gibson-Graham is the pen name of Katherine Gibson and Julie Graham. Graham is Prof. of Geography at the UMass, Amherst. Gibson is Senior Fellow of Human Geography at Australian National Univ., The End of Capitalism (As We Knew It), 1996, 263)
One of our goals as Marxists has been to produce a knowledge of capitalism. 
AND
its unity a fantasy, visible as a denial of diversity and change.


====Policy relevance is a pre-requisite to emancipation – purely theoretical focus ensures domination by current policy elites====
Jeroen Gunning (lecturer in international politics at the Department of International Politics at the University of Wales) 2007 &amp;#34;A Case for Critical Terrorism Studies?&amp;#34; Blackwell Synergy
The notion of emancipation also crystallizes the need for policy engagement. For, unless 
AND
among other things an attempt at empathy and cross-cultural understanding.102   



===Radical alternative===


====The permutation doesn~’t link– reformist political actions in context of radical change isn~’t mutually exclusive – It can be used to undermine systems of power====

**Dixon 5** (Chris, Activist and founding member of Direct Action Network, 2005, &amp;#34;Reflections on Privilege, Reformism, and Activism,&amp;#34; www.geocities.com/kk_abacus/ioaa/dixon2.html, accessed 3-6-05)
Evidently sasha doesn~’t grasp my argument in &amp;#34;Finding Hope.&amp;#34; Or else he disagrees
