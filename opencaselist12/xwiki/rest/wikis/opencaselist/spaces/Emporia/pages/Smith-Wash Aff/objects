===(This was copy-pasted from Emporia CW~’s wiki)===

====1AC starts with a narrative from Ryan about his mother====

====Our surrounding dictate some part of who we are. And my momma had lost something, an energy that kept her going. The alcohol just solidified something that was already going on around her, an environment of despair. But let~’s take a step back… ====

====Energy production necessitates a zone of sacrifice – while we enjoy the benefits of constant electricity, clean water, and technical gadgetry beyond belief, the hidden story of violence remains invisible – at every phase of the process of energy production, oppressed people are sacrificed for privilege. It is not just coal that burns but the inner cities themselves. ====
Robert Bullard explains in 2008 that 
(Robert D. Bullard, Ph.D, Environmental Justice Resource Center,_Clark Atlanta University, 7/2/08, &amp;#34;POVERTY, POLLUTION AND ENVIRONMENTAL RACISM: STRATEGIES FOR BUILDING HEALTHY AND SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES&amp;#34; http://www.ejrc.cau.edu/PovpolEj.html-http://www.ejrc.cau.edu/PovpolEj.html 
The United States is...poverty, and overloaded health care systems. 
This is not just a technical policy problem – if there was simply some zoning 
AND
some of the most acute forms of structural violence from public view. – 

====Thus, our investigation of this topic must begin with the way we socially construct zone of sacrifice. If what the resolution asks us to do is increase production of energy that disproportionately leaves its waste in my old neighborhood, then our answer is no thanks%21 ====

====Instead, we want to save the topic from the resolution. If energy policy necessitates zones of sacrifice that kill and hurt people because their identities, than we must question the historical, epistemological, and social factors that create that necessity. This is a deeper, better investigation into the topic that won~’t otherwise exist. ====

====Moreover, this debate round is about debate – if the zones of sacrifice are socially constructed, than debate has its own zones of sacrifice that must be investigated. Zones of sacrifice are manifested in debate in two connected ways: ====

====1. Literally – people from dilapidated and underprivileged communities have a far narrower chance of getting into debate to begin with. Environmental racism is not just something that makes the air dirty, it crushes the life chances of people who live in the zones of sacrifice. We need to be aware of the parts of world that have been written-off as disaster zones and think about who cannot be here as a result. ====

====2. Culturally – the way we think and talk change the way we act – there is no denying this in this history of environmental racism – thus, the seeds of physical destruction of bodies is in assumptions, epistemologies, and ethical calculations. If debate produces political energy, then we must ask ~’what are debate~’s zones of sacrifice?~’ What price to we pay for the ~’greater good~’ and who is it that is excluded as a result? ====

====Debate itself produces energy.====

====So often the energy we create is unable to effectively empower us to be agents of change in the world – we are always told to be patient policy makers that produce something worthwhile someday…but some of us don~’t have time to wait around. For some of us, we need change now. For some of us, tomorrow is not promised. Not only does the current model of debate, whereby we simulate game playing so we can be effective later, discourage us from creating change now, it also discourages meaningful participation from people who experience violence on a daily basis who don~’t have time to wait around for some change in their life, whose &amp;#34;someday&amp;#34; is not assured. ====

====It~’s time we assure them debate can be a space for true empowerment and synergy, it~’s time we re-enegergize debate. Not only does this model of debate have to be rethought, the way in which we have these conversations need to find a way to bring us back to the forefront of our discussions. Too often, debaters throw around lives as a tool to play the game of policy debate, dropping nuclear scenarios like its nothing. ====

====This process has desensitized some debaters to the largest atrocities, and leaves us unmotivated to satisfy the so called point of policy debate, to participate in politics in the future, likely because we they are convinced that, with all of the disasters associated with the political realm, there is no reason to, because everything is headed to hell anyways. We must engage in efforts to relate ourselves to the discussions we have in these spaces so when we leave the activity, whether it be for the weekend, or for good, we feel empowered and motivated to actually do things, because we view it as imperative or directly affecting out lives. ====

====Therefore, you should vote for the team that best performatively and methodologically energizes the debate space. ====

====In an effort to reap the benefits of competition inside the activity, we have made our agency and bodies the collateral for our politics. We become the zones of sacrifice for debate. We have to recognize that this activity is affected by those same structural inequailities that the topic strategically avoids. ====

====So it much more than saying there are zones of sacrifice inside of debate, rather there are pre-figured zones of sacrifice in debate. ====

====The method of the 1ac is to use to revolutionary power of debate to delegitimize those sacrifices in the realm of public deliberation ====
Iris Young writes in 2001 
(Iris Marion, late Professor in Political Science at the University of Chicago &amp;#34;Activist Challenges to Deliberative Democracy Author(s)&amp;#34;, Political Theory, Vol. 29, No. 5, Oct., p.682-5)

====I thought that after my mother died that Zones of sacrifice were empty, but they are not. They are filled with the voices and struggles of cultures that have been excluded and are still fighting to empower themselves. Our affirmative is an effort to allow those who are sacrificed to speak for themselves instead of carrying-over the assumption that they are dead and gone. ====

Judy Garland referenced the green farmlands of Kansas when she told audiences there was “No place like home” in The Wizard of Oz, but in The Wiz the yellow brick road was walked by Miss Diana Ross, a Dorothy from the concrete jungle of Harlem.  A school teacher who gave back to the community in which she resided, but who was too afraid of leaving home to venture into the world beyond it. Admonished by Aunt Em for never going farther than 125th street, we learn that a pre-condition for truly being home is the safety we all find in those around us because home is not a place, but a structure of support. As Dorothy opens the door to her New York residence to take out the trash after a Thanksgiving dinner, ToTo runs headlong into a blizzard that transports the pair to the magical Land of Oz where a pair of Silver Slippers snatched from the corpse of Evermeen, the Wicked Witch of the East and the magic of the Wiz seem to be her only hope for finding her way back home. Along the journey with the Lion, the Tin Man, and the Scarecrow, the  jumbled cast of misfits teaches us that no matter where we are going, we can’t get their alone.Faced with a yellow brick road lined with a limitless number of off-duty Taxi cabs and miles of open road, Dorothy, like the rest of us, gets on down the road on her search for home-place.


Just like Dorothy, I was on my journey to find home. The  house, or should I say the many houses that I resided at, were simply just that~-~-- houses.  I found it hard to find comfort in battered woman’s shelter where I knew no one and everybody was scared to disclose themselves to the next person, but shockingly enough, I found it hard to find a place of peace and tranquility in the dysfunctional household where crack was being sold out of the dining room window, mice slept with me in the bed, and food was present just as much as my biological father was – rarely. Nothing was stable. Nothing was the same. Every day was so different that I never got the time to find a place called home. It wasn’t until I found room 131 at central high did I start to feel somewhat at home. I say somewhat because debate I believe was scary for most of the students entering it. I have to give an 8 minute speech all by myself?? Hell to the naw!! After several days of practice with other students as central high school, it was time for our first actual competition – The Central High Debate Kansas City tournament. All the inner-cities pile in to the cafeteria all very chatty, but just to shake the nervous of the first competition. The thing that eased our minds the most was to know that each student was going through a trial of their own. I found new friends, I found family members, and I thought I found home. 

After two DKC tournaments, Rinehart felt as if we were ready for national competition. I will never forget loading up the coach bus along with 3 other schools from the district and making our way up 35 North to Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Once I arrived and stepped off the bus I felt a chill. I didn’t know if it was my uncomfort or the freezing weather of Iowa. Whatever it was, I had to get over it because it was time. I grab the tub off the bus and follow the rest of the UDL students inside. As we walk in into the 250 other most causasion stop their talking, their movements, and their lives, and stare at us as we walk to nearest open table and put our stuff down. That was first sign to me that debate here had to be something totally different. As the rounds, the tournaments and years went pass I knew I needed to change this place that provided me and so many other students an escape from our households. a point in my career where I had to put down the revisions of the patriot acts, the learn and serve America grants, the subsidies, and visas and talk about this community. A lot of bright people get together weekends on end to bounce ideas off of each other’s minds, but never once did we have a conversation about what took place in the cafeterias and more importantly, what took place in the actual debates. I found that regardless of the style of debate I engaged in, I could never just be Ryan. There was always a framework that I didn’t mean, a way to start my politics off better, no way of evaluating me inside of debates. But then I had the epiphany. Just like the students that told me to functionally leave the activity or adapt, I’ve been here just as long as you have. We are all Dorothy’s trying to find our home here, but I never was able to have a debate in my house. So if I am to do something by the time these last four or five tournaments are over, I wanna bring back to its home.
 

Weir 2008 (Allison, “Home and Identity: In memory of Iris Marion Young”, Hypatia,  volume 23, Number 3, Summer, pp. 4-21, Indiana University Press)

Iris Young argues that while Martin and Mohanty are right to point out that the boundaries of home typically serve to protect privilege, they are wrong to reject the ideal of home.... Perhaps we can imagine and embrace a different dream of a better home.

If home is necessary for members of aggrieved communities to find the power to resist, debate precludes the possibility of becoming a site of resistance for those who need it now:


Our stylistic norms for engagement are not only inaccessible but discourage people from even attempting to find home.  It is nearly impossible for disenfranchised individuals who have been trained to believe they will never succeed to become attached to this activity when they don’t feel welcome. Not only are their perspectives dismissed, but they themselves as people. We can never have an ethical government official that successfully interacts with communities of color when we train them to forego a simple hello for an additional 5 seconds of prep.  The current focus on the structure of debate and not those individuals who reside here means that the welcoming relationships of home are never present. 


Also, the form and content of arguments are structured by the politics of displacement that necessitates the search for home in the first place. Debaters have forgone the speech for the speech doc and spew horror stories that train us to be disempowered citizens that never act in the face of actual oppression.  Our current model of debate is disconnected from the lived realities of those affected by structural violence. That makes this activity useless to those who need it, and turns oppression into a game for those who are already here. 


Debate should not be a place of politics where we pretend every other aspect of our lives is left behind when you get on the van in the morning, but we should understand for some people the personal is the political.
What Diana Ross was searching for wasn’t just a cramped apartment in New York, but a site of community to mutually recover from the structural violence they witnessed on a daily basis.

In fact , this is the true purpose of energy.  When the Dorothy’s of this world think of energy, they don’t think of thorium reactors, but the energy required to get out of bed and navigate the struggle. We all get our energy from home, even the workers who run the power plant.  So in a sense, all energy finds it origin at home.  Instead of energy production, we need to direct our attention on home production here. Just like Dorothy and her friends, before we establish answer larger questions about what happens with the home or what is needed for it, we have to find one. Debate has been somewhat that place for me. I can honestly say I know debate more than anything else. 

Thus, the Role of the Ballot is for the judge to endorse the team that best methodologically and performatively brings debate home.

Unlike Dorothy, those excluded voices can’t click their silver slippers and fly away. We have to make pro-active efforts to be the agents of change that ensure this space and the knowledge produced here is accessible to all that need it.

Judy Garland may not have had much on the fabulous Diana Ross, but she did have one thing right…..

…..There is no place like home.
