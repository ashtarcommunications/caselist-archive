Part 1 – the Rio Puerco
Access, but not mobility – more a dream than something that can be achieved – just because of location that was available to us – not left behind but looked offer – exist in a non-existent kinda way – high school graduation – night class, economics 
On July 16, 1979...15 tailings dams broke, releasing their contents into the wider watershed areas.””
      Dr. Valerie Kuletz in The Tainted Desert, 1998
MUCH OF NATIVE NORTH AMERICA HAS BEEN MARKED-OFF AS ZONES OF SACRIFICE, AREAS WHERE THE LANDSCAPE AND ITS INHABITANTS ARE A SMALL COST FOR THE PURSUIT OF HEGEMONY – THE RIO PUERCO IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE – EVERY PHASE OF THE NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE SEEMS TO EXACT A HEAVY TOLL ON NATIVE NORTH AMERICA.  MINING REQUIRES WORKERS WHO ARE EXPOSED TO RADIATION AND SOOT, MINING LEAVES TAILING PILES THAT NO ONE WILL CLEAN-UP, WEAPONS ARE THEN TESTED ON OR VERY NEAR NATIVE LANDS, WHILE NUCLEAR PLANTS DISPOSE OF SPENT FUEL RODS NEAR INDIAN COMMUNITIES.

THE NUCLEAR AGE HAS NOT COME WITHOUT CONSEQUENCE – ITS JUST DESIGNED TO SEEM THAT WAY.  THE PRICE WE PAY FOR HEGEMONY IS THE HIDDEN VIOLENCE OF THE NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE.

The United States has ... far less prestige, privilege, and power.
THE IMPACT IS DEATH AND SUFFERING ON MASSIVE SCALE – ARMED WITH THE ABILITY TO MAKE VIOLENCE INVISIBLE, THE NEXUS OF POWERS THAT COMPRISE THE NUCLEAR INDUSTRY ARE UNLEASHED – HUMAN BEINGS BECOME DISPOSABLE, WHOLE SPACES AND CULTURES BECOME SACRIFICIAL

Welcome to the new era of...visions of the good society is now considered a waste of time. 
Part 2 – Mapping
What is most dangerous about the nuclear establishment is not its violence but its invisibility – the process of engaging with the narratives read in part 1 is the act of mapping the nuclear landscape.  This process is necessary to re-think our ethical approach to nuclear violence.  We cannot move forward with technical fixes to small problems – we have to acknowledge that the nuclear age is upon us and its price was and remains awful
Dr. Valerie Kuletz, independent scholar and writer, 1998
(The Tainted Desert: Environmental and Social Ruin in the American West, pg. 118-120)
With the inclusion of...grounds of their lethal waste.
MAPPING IS NOT JUST ABOUT URANIUM, ITS ABOUT POLITICS – WE NEED TO RADICALIZE ACADEMIC THOUGHT SO THAT IT CAN PRO-ACTIVELY ENGAGE IN PEDAGOGY – WE DO NOT HAVE A PLAN BUT THIS DEBATE IS NOT ABOUT THE TECHNO-BUREAOCRATIC POLICY CHANGE, IT IS ABOUT PEDAGOGY.  LEARNING THE SKILLS OF ARGUMENTATION IS GOOD BUT SHOULDN’T BE THE ONLY THING WE DO IN DEBATE – WE NEED TO BETTER LEARN HOW TO ENGAGE POLICY QUESTIONS IN THE NUCLEAR AGE.  WE CANNOT DO THAT IGNORANTLY WITH A LONG HISTORY OF NUCLEAR VIOLENCE BELOW OUR FEET.  INSTEAD, WE CHALLENGE THE JUDGE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO THIS INSTANCE OF NEO-LIBERAL SACRIFICE AND VOTE AFFIRMATIVE TO MAP THE NUCLEAR LANDSCAPE.

In opposition to these ...investment in public life (Couldry 2004).

FINALLY, THE PROBLEM OF NUCLEAR WASTE IS NOT GOING ANYWHERE – THE AFFIRMATIVE IS A MEANS OF ENGAGING IMPORTANT POLICY QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT TO DO WITH WASTE ON AN ETHICAL LEVEL – WE ARE A PRE-REQUISITE TO DEALING ETHICALLY WITH THE INEVITABLE PROBLEM OF NUCLEAR WASTE
