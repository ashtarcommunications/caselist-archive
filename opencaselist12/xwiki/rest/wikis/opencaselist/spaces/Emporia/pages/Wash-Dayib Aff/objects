 This time as visual as possible,&#xD;
 Guns blast at the hospital,&#xD;
 The walls are white washed with tin rooftops,&#xD;
 To show love you lick two shots,&#xD;
 It&amp;#39;s dangerous man,&#xD;
 Journalists hire gunmen; there’s violent women,&#xD;
 Kids trust no one cause fire burnt them,&#xD;
 Refugees die in boats, headed for peace,&#xD;
 Is anyone scared of death here&amp;#39; Not in the least,&#xD;
 I walk by the old lady selling coconuts under the tree,&#xD;
 Life is cheap here but wisdom is free,&#xD;
 The beach boys hang on the side, leaning with pride,&#xD;
 Scam artists and gangsters fiendin to fight,&#xD;
 I walk with three kids that can&amp;#39;t wait to meet God&#xD;
 Lately, that&amp;#39;s Bucktooth, Mohamed and Crybaby,&#xD;
 What they do everyday just to eat lord have mercy,&#xD;
 Strapped with an AK and they blood thirsty...&#xD;
 &#xD;
So what&amp;#39;s hardcore? Really, are you hardcore?&#xD;

Energy is more than just coal, crude oil, natural gas, nuclear power, solar power and wind power. Why do we never push the discussion to the energy that people have, or the energy they lack. I grew up in Somalia. A nation ridden with war, violence and poverty. But even worse than my experience was the time my parents spent there. They witnessed their neighborhood go from a beautiful place called home, to a torrent wasteland. Yet they still had that energy to get up, go somewhere and do something with their lives. Energy can be that warm smile my parents gave me when we fled the country and moved to India. Searching for a new life where none of the same disregard for people’s lands exists.**&#xD;

For some of us, we need change now. For some of us, tomorrow is not promised. Not only does the current model of debate, whereby we simulate game playing so we can be effective later, discourage us from creating change now, it also discourages meaningful participation from people who experience violence on a daily basis who don’t have time to wait around for some change in their life, whose “someday” is not assured.&#xD;

Not only does this model of debate have to be rethought, the way in which we have these conversations needs to find a way to bring us back to the forefront of our discussions. Too often, debaters throw around lives as a tool to play the game of policy debate, dropping nuclear scenarios like its nothing.&#xD;

We must engage in efforts to relate ourselves to the discussions we have in these spaces so when we leave the activity, whether it be for the weekend, or for good, we feel empowered and motivated to actually do things, because we view it as imperative or directly affecting our lives.&#xD;

 Rocket propelled grenades blow you away if you front,&#xD;
 We got no police ambulance or fire fighters,&#xD;

 Bullshit politicians talking bout solutions, but it&amp;#39;s all talk,&#xD;
 You can&amp;#39;t go half a block with a road block,&#xD;
 You don&amp;#39;t pay at the road block you get your throat shot,&#xD;
 And each road block is set up by these gangsters,&#xD;
 And different gangsters go by different standards,&#xD;
 For example, the evening is a no go,&#xD;
 Unless you wanna wear a bullet like a logo,&#xD;
 In the day you should never take the alleyway,&#xD;
 The only thing that validates you is the AK,&#xD;
