	In order to address any problem effectively inside the debate space or even outside it, we believe an individual should follow three basic criteria that encompass all sides of an argument. This is known as the 3 Tier Methodology. First is…
1)      Social Location (Where you speak from) – This means you speak from your own experiences, whether those experiences were good or bad. Without a first-hand account of how something really happens, then you fall into an endless cycle of basing the truth off of what others have told you, and not what you know. 
2)      Traditional Intellectuals –You have to use expert authors who lend their insight on issues/communities. This comes with reading evidence or just citing someone and their work. But relying exclusively on traditional intellectuals creates a lack of social location and experience. 
3)      Organic Intellectuals – people who rise up from aggrieved communities and tell it like it is. There are four criteria to be one:
a.      Be alligned with members of an aggrieved community
b.      Represents the needs of that community
c.      Create a counter hegemonic discourse (that resists oppression)
d.      Build coalitions
