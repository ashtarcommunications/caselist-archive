The drive for renewable energy plays into the capitalist drive for profits – planetary catastrophe is inevitable under capitalism regardless of whether we transition from oil to renewables.
Principia Dialectica 2009 Principia Dialectica, &amp;#34;Capitalism Isn’t Addicted to Oil - but Profits,&amp;#34; September 30, 2009, http://www.principiadialectica.co.uk/blog/?p=564-http://www.principiadialectica.co.uk/blog/?p=564 
In 2008, the companies making the largest worldwide profits were all oil companies (Exxon  Mobil, Gazprom, Shell, Chevron, BP and Petrobas), making a total of $144bn (the 7th ranked was Microsoft with 18bn). As well as being a large source of profit, the Crude-Oil Production and Mining sector also provided some of the best financial returns worldwide:
14% – Food Consumer Products 14% – Crude-Oil Production and Mining 12% – Pharmaceuticals
9% – Household and Personal Products 7% – Tobacco 6% – Entertainment (World’s six highest industry sectors ranked by % returns on assets – 2008) (Source 1, below)
Greens have promoted the idea that and will continue to arise, whilst capitalism persists.


ALTERNATIVE FORMS OF ENERGY FAILS TO ADDRESS THE REAL ISSUES OF ENERGY BY ONLY OFFERING TECHNICAL FIXES. THE “ENERGY CRISIS” OF THE 1AC IS ROOTED IN THE CULTURAL DESIRE TO PUSH THE LIMITS OF PRODUCTION. THIS ONLY CREATES AN “ENERGY BOOMERRANG EFFECT” WHERE TO ANSWER AN ENERGY ISSUE WE CREATE MORE ENERGY THAT ONLY PUSHES THE BOUNDRIES FURTHER BRINGING US BACK TO THE IMPACTS OF THE 1AC WHICH ALL BE INEVITABLE UNTIL WE ADDRESS THE TRUE ISSUE OF PRODUCTION.

Nuclear production locks in productionism through obsession with finance, competitiveness and technological solutions while disproportionality placing the cost on citizens through austerity measures

State economics turn to nuclear technology as a replacement for oil for energy security and imperialist expansion – capitalist’s only turn to nuclear power when the state passes favorable policy

Capitalism’s naturalization of the process of subjugation creates social exclusion on a global scale – the ultimate ethico-political responsibility is to challenge the foundations of this system’s organization principles
Daly in 4(Slavoj and Glyn, Conversations with Zizek, 14-6)
For Zizek it is imperative that we cut ….. a &amp;#39;glitch&amp;#39; in an otherwise sound matrix.


Thus the Alternative: Vote negative to do nothing

Doing nothing is not just sitting and waiting for the moment to attack—it is the only genuine political act~-~-it is an act of abstaining from the depoliticized gameboard of capitalism by refusing to play their game—ultimately withdrawing past the point of commodification
Zizek in 8 (Slavoj, Senior researcher at the Institute of Sociology, University of Ljubljana, Violence: Big Ideas// small books. Picador, pg(s) 213-7, kdf)
Last but not least, the lesson of the intricate rela¬tionship between subjective and …….forcefully confronts us with the vacuity of today&amp;#39;s democracies.

THE PERM DOESN’T ENDANGER THE SYSTEM – THE ALT WILL BE ROBBED OF ITS UNIVERSAL CHARACTER AND WILL LOCK US INTO CAPITALISM
Zizek 2006 (Slavoj, senior researcher at the Institute for Social Studies in Ljubjana, The Universal Exception, pg. 248-250)
However, the outcome of this crisis ……institutionalized parliamentary politics and new social movements.


The affirmatives view of the environment and capitalism is not as innocent as it appears~-~-it represents a subjective knowledge of the world infused with a managerial ethos~-~-this approach maintains the view that the environment as a natural resource for consumption—They legitimate capitalist consumption~-~- plan only strives for creative ways to maintain resources to consume.
Luke in 2k2 (Timothy W., Program Chair of the Government and International Affairs Program, School of Public and International Affairs at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, “eco-managerliasim: Environmental Studies as a Power/Knowledge formation,&amp;#34; http://web.archive.org/web/20030802005346/http://aurora.icaap.org/2003Interviews/luke.html, kdf) http://aurora.icaap.org/2003Interviews/luke.html, kdf

CAPITALISM IS THE ROOT CAUSE TO ALL THEIR IMPACTS
Brown in 5 (Charles, Capitalism, Exploitation, and Oppression, April 13, http://archives.econ.utah.edu/archives/pen-l/2005w15/msg00062.htm,  kdf) 
The capitalist class owns the factories, the banks, …….society at large remains a shameful fact of life in the U.S.

DESPITE THEIR CLAIMS~-~-THE HEGEMONY CAPITALISM IS ALL ENCOMPASSING—MORPHING INTO NEW SHAPES AT THE SMALLEST SIGN OF RESISTANCE—FINDING A WAY OUT OF CAPITALISM RESULTS IN MORE CAPITALISM—AT BEST THEIR ETHICO-POLITICAL RESPONSES IS STILL TAINTED 
Critchley in 7 (Simon Prof of Philosophy @ New School; Infinitely Demanding: Ethics of Commitment, Politics of Resistance; Verso, p.97-99, kdf) 
Sadly, what I have just said is the easy part. For me, Marx&amp;#39;s analysis of capitalism remains the sine qua non for the understanding of contemporary socio-economic life. However, what follows from this for our thinking about politics? That is the question. Are we witnessing, as Marx and Engels foresaw with particular clarity in the Manifesto, a simplification of …………Gramsci writes, &amp;#39;For though hegemony is ethicopolitical, it must also be economic&amp;#39;.

LA Times ‘7 (“Pollution on the hoof”, Oct 15, http://articles.latimes.com/print/2007/oct/15/opinion/ed-methane15, CMR)
It&amp;#39;s a silent but deadly source of greenhouse gases that contributes more to global warming than the entire world transportation sector, yet politicians almost never discuss it, and environmental lobbyists and other green activist groups seem unaware of its existence.
That may be because it&amp;#39;s tough to take cow …..damage of ranching would have to be cut in half just to keep emissions at their current, dangerous level.


The 1AC is a simulation of chaos used to justify permanent war – we’re so terrified of the environmental catastrophe that we end up wanting more intrusions on our freedom to extend totalitarian warfare – this makes the entire planet a gameboard for military elites to extend their control over; the ballot maps you as a human commodity on this gameboard – the impact is a global system of control that replicates the impacts it tries to avoid at all levels of society

Threats about the environment leads to the worse form of biopolitical control and destruction turning the case—Scares about oil spill over to wars in foreign countries to secure more—the same thing will happen with the environment
