Georgetown EM, with Jarrod Atchison as the Judge&#xD;
1NC Positions: UDL personal story, Warming disproportionately affects people of color, rethink location of speaking about climate change, debating is high speed mental masturbation, the game is white, debate trains liars, RoB - performatively and methodologically engages in scholarship on climate change, we affirm 1) include social location, 2) traditional intellectuals. 3) use organic intellectualism: a - must be a member of aggrieved community, b - speak on behalf of community, c - create a counter hegemonic discourse.&#xD;
2NC Extended Args: RoB - who best engages in best form of scholarship on Climate Change, stylistic DA&amp;#39;s - their approach to debate is flippant to those most affected by climate change, they exclude this discussion from debate. Accessibility of debate is prerequisite to deliberation. Debate has become elitist, demographic changes, debate itself reflects racism.&#xD;
1NR Args:Perm fails to incorporate the three tiered process in the 1NC, they are not engaging or are not able to engage us in this debate round because they deny social location&#xD;
2NR Strat: the aff is behind on the RoB, the aff&amp;#39;s exclusion of minorities from debate turns their deliberation arguments, advocates will not become trained to engage in the political process. &#xD;

Denial is even worse than colorblindness. Concerns about climate change and global warming that omit discussion of race and racism reinforce white privilege. This is not a mere link of omission, but a form of racist marginalizing that undermines survival.

Tim Wise 10, “With Friends Like These, Who needs Blenn Beck? Racism and white Privilege on the Liberal Left”

They say that we are the ones destroying debate by the opposite is the case – jargon, high-tech speed, and incomprehensibility are the real crisis. Emricialy, this has eroded support for debate and mae it inaccessible and non-useful for many. Without addressing this cris, all their fainess-related disads to our frameowkr are non-unique. Debate is bleeding-out now, stepping outside of staztus quo practice isd a necessary condition tofor debate to keep existing.

See Emporia CW for several supportive pieces of evidence we read in the block (Wise, Cambell, fasching and dechant, etc.  This is the most recent interpretation that we&amp;#39;ve read.&#xD;
&#xD;
A.  Interpretation – The affirmative must have a grounded increase in energy production that is tied to and dependent on the bodies and voices of the speakers. &#xD;
&#xD;
Grounded activism acknowledges that being able to speak in this space makes all speech political.&#xD;
&#xD;
B. Violation – the affirmative does not actually increase energy production – there merely present a plan for how the USFG might increase energy production.&#xD;
 &#xD;
C.	Vote negative –&#xD;
a.	Presumption – the affirmative does nothing. &#xD;
b.	Limits – There are an infinite amount of potential plans and policy proposals&#xD;
c.	Predictability –  The USFG is inherently unpredictable body politics are not. &#xD;
d.	Education - 	&#xD;
i.	Topic specific education – aff interpretation encourages bad debate including condotionality, plan inclusive counter-plans, international fiat, process pics and a host of other bad debates.&#xD;
ii.	Activism good – plan focus debate requires that we invest our advocacy in bureaucratic institutions as opposed to individuals. &#xD;
e.	Fairness – &#xD;
i.	Ground – aff interpretation destroys our disadvantage ground based on individual action and forces us to defend USFG inaction – they make it impossible to be negative.&#xD;
ii.	Marginalized voices D/A – requiring a discussion of USFG policy instead of individual action marginalizes participants whose views are excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
These are all voting issues for obvious reasons. &#xD;
