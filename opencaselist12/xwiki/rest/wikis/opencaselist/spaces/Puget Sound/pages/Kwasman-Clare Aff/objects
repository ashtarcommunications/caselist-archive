Grid Vulnerability. DOD is unable to provide its bases with electricity when the civilian &#xD;

===Prolif Advantage===&#xD;
&#xD;
====Advantage two is prolif====&#xD;

The recent announcement of the 2012 record-breaking ice loss over the Arctic sea 
AND
the climate system will not wait for humanity to get its act together.

====We~’ll isolate 3 internal links to warming: First is the nuclear renaissance====

====The aff is key to reinvigorating nuclear energy - flexible incentives would prompt a thorium renaissance====

Production Cost Incentive: A production cost incentive is a performance-based incentive.

Burning coal for power is the largest source of atmospheric CO2, which drives global 
AND
, ending 10 billion tons per year of CO2 emissions from coal plants.

====Second is natural gas trade-off:====

====Financial incentives would make nuclear cost-competitive with natural gas – natty~’s price volatility means countries have an incentive to switch to more reliable energy sources====
**Squassoni 9** (Sharon, senior associate in the Nonproliferation program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, &amp;#34;Nuclear energy: rebirth or resuscitation&amp;#34; Carnegie Institute for International Peace&amp;#34; http://www.carnegieendowment.org/files/nuclear_energy_rebirth_resuscitation.pdf-http://www.carnegieendowment.org/files/nuclear_energy_rebirth_resuscitation.pdf)

Renewed interest in nuclear energy arises from the desire to find¶ alternatives to expensive 
AND
energy because of the existing nuclear supply structure and location of uranium resources.

====Displacing natural gas is key to solve warming – methane leaks pose a greater risk to the atmosphere than CO2 and coal====
**Howarth et al 11** Robert Howarth, Renee Santoro, and Anthony Ingraffea, professors of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, and of Civil and Enviro Engineering at Cornell, &amp;#34;Methane and the greenhouse-gas footprint of natural gas from shale formations.&amp;#34; Climatic Change 106:4, April 2011

We evaluate the greenhouse gas footprint of natural gas obtained by high volume hydraulic fracturing 
AND

Arguably, the biggest impact of Fukushima on the nuclear debate, ironically, has

Recent estimates show that an enormous global fossil-fuel total resource base is available

Now, with 7 billion people on the planet — heading to 10 billion — 
AND
timber, ranching, and farming such crops as soybeans and oil palm.

====Climate change also affects humans unequally.  Regions responsible for the least GHG emissions will be at the greatest disadvantage.  Sea level rise puts the hundreds of millions of people living on coastal and low-lying regions at risk, while climate shifts magnify food and water shortages.  Entire islands are sinking.  Action is key.====

===Solvency===

====Thus, we affirm: The United States federal government should substantially increase market-fixed production cost incentives for Liquid Fuel Thorium Small Modular Reactors.====

====Observation two is solvency:====

====Talking about state policies that improve the ways we produce energy and contest climate change has a radical potential.  The 1AC affirms a militant pluralist assemblage tasked with exploring new strategies for reducing inequality and changing human interaction with our so-called ~’environment.~’====

3.    Today, perhaps the initial target should be on reconstituting established patterns of 
AND
, role performance, cultural ethos, market regulation, and citizen activism.

====Praxis can be hard, but planning action is essential for achieving our critical goals.  The world is not reducible solely to discourse—subjectivity is also positioned within material circumstances that influence thought—this demands particular strategies for change====

If I get worked up about these issues, then this is because I think 
AND
, hitching everything on psychology, attachment, and identification. Well done%21

====Even if our aff does not resolve calculative thinking or our alienation from the environment, our advocacy of policy changes to address global warming is still essential.  The scientific consensus around warming is not replicated in current politics.  We should recognize and contest the destitution emblematic in warming denialism. ====
