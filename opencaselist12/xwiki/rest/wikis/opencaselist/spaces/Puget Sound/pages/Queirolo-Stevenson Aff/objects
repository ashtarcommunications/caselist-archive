====There is a war, between those who say there is a war and those who say they are not.  On one side are forces of socialization and neutralization, who isolate forms-of-life from their constitutive ethical connections to enhance capitalist productivity.  On the other are those who seek to reclaim the connections joining friends and enemies, who resist the atomizing force of capital, and who reinvigorate conflict at every turn.  This debate, this life is a forced choice: whose side are you on?====&#xD;
**Read ~’10** Jason Read, &amp;#34;From Restricted to General Antagonism: Tiqqun~’s Introduction to Civil War,&amp;#34; Unemployed Negativity, 5/27/2010, http://www.unemployednegativity.com/2010/05/from-restricted-to-general-antagonism.html&#xD;
What then is the best way to read this Introduction? What is intending to &#xD;
AND&#xD;
disappearance of antagonism, of struggle, as itself a form of struggle.&#xD;
&#xD;
====This war is fought primarily through metaphysical division.  Everywhere, we are separated and ordered into atomized, isolated units of production—civilization apart from wilderness, science apart from metaphysics, private apart from public.  All this follows from the original establishment of sovereignty, subordinating nature under the whims of man, the political animal.====&#xD;
**Smith ~’11** Mick Smith, Against Ecological Sovereignty, University of Minnesota Press: Minneapolis, 2011, p. xi-xiii&#xD;
This contest is political because human dominion over the Earth is not, as so &#xD;
AND&#xD;
,&amp;#34; typifies the operation of both sovereignty and the anthropologi- cal machine. &#xD;
&#xD;
====A significant consequence of our anthropocentric domination is an elevation of oikos over ecology.  Environmental concerns are understood in terms of profit margins and security calculations; the prospects that civilization itself is bent on total destruction hardly crosses our registers of thought.====&#xD;
**Cohen ~’12** Tom Cohen, &amp;#34;Introduction,&amp;#34; Telemorphosis, ed. Tom Cohen, Open Humanities Press, 2012, p. 13-15&#xD;
Warnings regarding the planet earth~’s imminent depletion of reserves or &amp;#34;life as we know &#xD;
AND&#xD;
our homeland, unaware of all the ruses that maintain that spurious home.&#xD;
&#xD;
====Management conceals the reduction of the population to bare life within the tautological epistemic shield of the ~’greater good~’====&#xD;
**Smith ~’11** Mick Smith, Against Ecological Sovereignty, University of Minnesota Press: Minneapolis, 2011, p. 90-91&#xD;
This talk of the complicity between absolute innocence and system- atic guilt may seem &#xD;
AND&#xD;
are all guilty of our own impending technologically mediated reduction to bare life. &#xD;
&#xD;
====The Imaginary Party is the unrepresentible force combatting the atomization of Empire, seeking to redirect the paradigm of modern power away from bare life toward a politics which enhances and accentuates forms-of-life.====&#xD;
**Tiqqun ~’10** Introduction to Civil War, Tiqqun, semiotext(e): Los Angeles, 2010, p. 175-187&#xD;
69 Everything allowed by Empire is for us similarly limited: spaces, words, &#xD;
AND&#xD;
machines, for this alone makes it possible to live and to struggle.&#xD;
&#xD;
====Text: Affirm the Imaginary Party.====&#xD;
&#xD;
====What is energy?  We commonly define it as work, where work is defined as the transfer of energy.  Perhaps energy signifies something more, the basic processes of becoming that continually shape our lived existences and affective interactions.   Voting aff lifts restrictions on the lively energy of forms-of-life.====&#xD;

Delight has the bodily feeling of buoyancy, of dancing lightly, effortless motion, &#xD;
AND&#xD;
not only the efforts of work but the effortlessness of grace as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
====Encounter the aff as an intellectual assemblage reaching for criticality, multiplying affective relations to create more out of less. The intellectual and political strategy of the Imaginary party is a fissile reaction; vote aff to make this debate nuclear powered.====&#xD;

The practical problem we face, if we try to go that new route, &#xD;
AND&#xD;
, deploy them.&amp;#34; Then we would have gone for good beyond iconoclasm.&#xD;
&#xD;
====The role of the ballot is to maximize confrontation.====&#xD;
&#xD;
====The physical destruction of our world is paralleled only by the emptiness which we experience in our daily lives.  The earth has been flattened so that we can put a strip mall on top.  Everywhere, power marks out spaces and norms of operation, telling us what to do and where to do it.  Debate is no different; conflict is avoided through reference to ~’rules~’, reading cards from Webster~’s and the US Army, like that~’s responsive.  We should resist these attempts at neutralization and reclaim this space as a site for conflict.====&#xD;

Everything that today is acceptable as a landscape for us is the fruit of bloody &#xD;
AND&#xD;
is political: because it is the place where the present confrontation occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
====Organizational politics cannibalize any principled activity by subordinating an ethics of encounter to self-preservation====&#xD;
**The Invisible Committee**, French anarcho-communist grad students, The Coming Insurrection, **2009**, Semiotext(e) [[http://libcom.org/files/thecominsur_booklet~~[1~~].pdf-http://libcom.org/files/thecominsur_booklet%5b1%5d.pdf]]&#xD;
Expect nothing from organizations. Beware of all existing social milieus, and above all&#xD;
AND&#xD;
revolutionary because they are only concerned with the preservation of their sad comfort.&#xD;

====Human rights give birth to state sovereignty and the presupposition of the citizen====
Giorgio **Agamben**, professor of philosophy at the College International de Philosophie in Paris, Means Without End: Notes on Politics, **2000**, p. 20-21
It is time to cease to look at all the declarations of rights from 1789 
AND
presupposition that must never come to light as such) of the citizen.


====The state is a pathology—insurrectionary violence can destabilize its hegemony through a politics of resonance.====
**The Invisible Committee**, French anarcho-communist grad students, The Coming Insurrection, **2009**, Semiotext(e) http://libcom.org/files/thecominsur_booklet~~1~~.pdf-http://libcom.org/files/thecominsur_booklet%5b1%5d.pdf
It goes without saying that the attachment of the French to the state – the 
AND
reality, which from Greece to the French banlieues2 is seeking its consistency.

====The political is dead.  We must forge a new emancipatory radicalism outside of traditional structures.====
**The Invisible Committee**, French anarcho-communist grad students, The Coming Insurrection, **2009**, Semiotext(e) http://libcom.org/files/thecominsur_booklet~~1~~.pdf-http://libcom.org/files/thecominsur_booklet%5b1%5d.pdf
In 1945, Kojeve wrote: &amp;#34;The &amp;#34;official&amp;#34; political ideal of France 
AND
elections. France is indeed the red lantern of the western zone.23

====Ojakangas is wrong – he misreads Agamben and biopolitics, thereby masking the violence inherent to biopolitics====
Michael **Dillon**, Professor of Politics and International Relations at Lancaster University, May **2005**, Foucault Studies, No. 2, p. 37-38
Substantially devoted to contesting Giorgio Agamben~’s argument that there is an intimate intersection between biopower 
AND
issue becomes less the degree of faithlessness than the worth of the betrayal.

====Reject their attempt to suture debate into a clearly defined zone of community—prefer confrontation and difference====
**Secomb 2k** Linnell Secomb ~~lecturer in Gender Studies at the University of Sydney~~ Fractured Community * Hypatia 15.2 (2000) 133-150, project muse
Various feminist theorists have expressed skepticism about the ideal of community. Iris Marion Young 
AND
this possibility by describing community as an &amp;#34;unworking&amp;#34; without common purpose.


====Predictability decimates revolutionary vitalism—affirm our advocacy because it leaves the cops scratching their heads====
**Goddard ~’6 **Michael Goddard, &amp;#34;Felix and Alice in Wonderland: The Encounter between Guattari and Berardi and the Post-Media Era,&amp;#34; Generation-Online, 7/6/2006, http://www.generation-online.org/p/fpbifo1.htm
What this type of radio achieved most of all was the short-circuiting of 
AND
being necessary, at the present stage to outline projections of societal change.&amp;#34;

====Their knowledge feeds the practice of violent governmentality====
**Adler and Bernstein ~’5** Emanuel Adler, professor of international relations at Hebrew university and Steven Bernstein, associate professor of international relations at university of Toronto, Michael Barnett, professor of international relations at university of Minnesota, and Raymond Duvall, professor of political science at the university of Minnesota, editors, Power In Global Governance, 2005, pg. 303-305
Epistemic validity refers to &amp;#34;legitimate&amp;#34; knowledge, i.e., knowledge that 
AND
and, therefore, have led to increased demands for accountability and democracy.

====The representational logic of role playing eradicates the potentiality of the here and now in favor of a traced and predetermined line of bureaucratic repression.  The 1AC is a rhizome; let it follow its own path instead of tracing restrictions on it====
**Deleuze and Guattari ~’87 **Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus, trans. Brian Massumi, 1987, p. 12-14
5 and 6. Principle of cartography and decalcomania: a rhizome is not amenable 
AND
on the other hand, acts on desire by external, productive outgrowths.

====Refuse the mad frenzy for policy resolution. The only way out of ethical failure and anthropocentric extermination is an affirmation beyond sovereignty.====
**Smith ~’11** Mick Smith, Against Ecological Sovereignty, University of Minnesota Press: Minneapolis, 2011, p. 219-221
THE PURPOSE OF THIS BOOK is to open possibilities for rethinking and constituting ecological ethics 
AND
short, they want a solution that maintains the claims of ecological sovereignty.

====Prefer sabotage over flimsy post-politics====
**The Invisible Committee**, French anarcho-communist grad students, The Coming Insurrection, **2009**, Semiotext(e) http://libcom.org/files/thecominsur_booklet~~1~~.pdf-http://libcom.org/files/thecominsur_booklet%5b1%5d.pdf
Sabotage every representative authority. Spread the talk. Abolish general assemblies. The first 
AND
are unnecessary where coordination exists, organizations aren~’t needed when people organize themselves.

====Role-playing as the state mistakes the nature of contemporary oppression—it is not something monolithic, a center of power with a brain and eyes that we can only swing at from afar; it is instead constructed molecularly, distributed and maintained through the little fascisms inside all of us.  The struggle against fascism begins with an awareness and combatting of our own inner fascists through a politics of energetic joy in debate.====
**Foucault ~’77 **Michel Foucault, preface to Anti-Oedipus, Penguin: London, 1977, p. xl-xiv
During the years 1945-1965 (I am referring to Europe), there was 
AND
constant generator of de-individualization. Do not become enamored of power.

====The topic is always already metaphorical====
**Spivak ~’76 **Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, Translator~’s Preface to Of Grammatology, Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1976, p. xxii-xxiv
It should by now be clear that Nietzsche~’s &amp;#34;suspicion of the value of truth 
AND
within the speech-writing hierarchy the mark of a Nietzschean &amp;#34;genealogy.&amp;#34;

====Actually, you~’re the nihilists, staking your constitution on the annihilation of ~’weird~’ and ~’different~’ arguments like our K while you pride yourself for your ascetic ability to absorb limitations.  Affirming agonism means affirming this difference on the battlefield of argument, not hiding behind the safe and familiar walls of ~’framework.~’====
**Acampora ~’2 **Christa Davis Acampora, professor of philosophy at Hunter College of CUNY, &amp;#34;Of Dangerous Games and Dastardly Deeds,&amp;#34; International Studies in Philosophy, vol. 34, no. 3, Fall 2002
II. Dastardly Deeds The so-called &amp;#34;Good Eris,&amp;#34; described in &amp;#34;
AND
certain human freedom to be active participants in shaping our own lives. xvii

====The DA was not rational policy debate—it was a neurotic catastrophe preparedness exercise. The only thing we learn is how to duck and cover.====
**Aradau and van Munster ~’12** Claudia Aradau, and Rens van Munster, &amp;#34;The Time/Space of Preparedness: Anticipating the ~’Next Terrorist Attack~’,&amp;#34; Space and Culture 2012 15:98, 3/21/2012, sage
Second, imaginaries of &amp;#34;the next terrorist attack&amp;#34; appear to interrupt the temporality 
AND
the illusion of linear time and allow subjects to navigate spaces and places.

====Radicals like us are the good guys.  Whitman~’s policing of debate simply shields the powerful.  The impact is market fundamentalism and NV2L====
George **Monbiot** ~~Journalist, Activists, and Academic~~, published in the Guardian 18th January 2011, Who threatens us most - peaceful campaigners or a private militia run by police chiefs? The Real Domestic Extremists Posted 1/17 January 17, **2011**
The people challenging corporate power are often defamed as destructive anarchists. Yet they are 
AND
? If ACPO is still operating in 2012, you~’ll have your answer.

====Rationalist debate about policy ignores a prior question of values and ethics that means the end of politics====
George **Monbiot** ~~Journalist, Activists, and Academic~~  The Values Of Everything &amp;#34;Progressive causes are failing: here~’s how they could be turned around&amp;#34; Published in the Guardian 10/12 12th October **2010**

the stronger someone~’s extrinsic aspirations, the weaker his or her intrinsic goals.

====Their call for &amp;#34;pre-imperial&amp;#34; land rights presupposes a totalizing conception which depoliticizes the geographic gaze and rationalizes cultural difference in order to exclude it====
Akhil **Gupta**, Department of Anthropology at Stanford, **and** James **Ferguson**, Department of Anthropology at UC-Irvine, &amp;#34;Beyond ~’Culture~’: Space, Identity, and the Politics of Difference,&amp;#34; Cultural Anthropology 7.1, **1992**, pp.13-14, JSTOR
Changing our conceptions of the relation between space and cultural difference offers a new perspective 
AND
and economic world, but &amp;#34;across cultures&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;between societies.&amp;#34; 

====This makes alt solvency extremely suspect—refuse any acceptance of ecological sovereignty because of the ideological and political undertones it carries====
**Smith ~’11** Mick Smith, Against Ecological Sovereignty, University of Minnesota Press: Minneapolis, 2011, p. 121-125
But even though the timeless mythic principles on which state authority is constituted are supposed

to suspend, to place in abeyance, ethics and politics as such.

====Dialectics is conservative and terrible—it can never overcome the oppositional unities it takes as its philosophical basis, making cooption inevitable====
**Tiqqun ~’7** This Is Not a Program, semiotext(e): Los Angeles, 2007, p. 25-27
In his final book, Mario Tronti observes that &amp;#34;the workers~’ movement wasn~’t defeated 
AND
is Empire, and, for Empire, we are the Imaginary Party.

====The Imaginary Party is excessive to all dialectal reductions—any attempt at individuation collapses into reactionary Stalinism—prefer continual unrepresentability====
**Tiqqun ~’7** This Is Not a Program, semiotext(e): Los Angeles, 2007, p. 38-43
Before ~’68 brought the dialectic swaggering back— the dialectic as the way of thinking

====Radical singularity solves better than revolutionary subjectivity—key to avert cooption====
**Tiqqun ~’7** This Is Not a Program, semiotext(e): Los Angeles, 2007, p. 43-45
There is no &amp;#34;revolutionary identity.&amp;#34; Under Empire, it is instead non-

And, of course, for Empire, every determination is a negation.

====Securitization DA—the dream of political unity requires violent social managerialism====
Anthony **Burke**, lecturer in politics at the University of Adelaide, Borderlands Volume 1, No. 2, **2002**, online: http://www.borderlandsejournal.adelaide.edu.au/vol1no2_2002/burke_perverse.html, accessed January 7, 2005

====Sovereignty DA—extend Smith—modernity~’s constituted on a division between human and animal life.  No enlightenment politics can avoid the ultraviolence this entails====

Finally, terror is not linked solely to the utopian belief in the unfettered power
