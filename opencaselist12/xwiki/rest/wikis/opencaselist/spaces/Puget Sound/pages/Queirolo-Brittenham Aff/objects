===Story Time===

====A not so long time ago, in a galaxy that was quite similar to ours, there existed a world full of trash. A world filled with garbage that doesn~’t get talked about, and a world where life was built and constituted by a thing so fundamental to the smooth functioning of society that it was entirely excluded from social orders: People see it everywhere, they~’re constantly bombarded with it from all sides—individuals become disillusioned with it; they build lives on SHIT and WASTE, on the LEFTOVERS of someone else~’s enjoyment. Such is the life of Nick, a paranoid conspiratorial theorist who exists in the book &amp;#34;Underworld.&amp;#34;====

====Modern politics situate us in a similar place. Landfills hoard our waste out of sight and out of mind. They are talked about only in so far as to not talk about them later. They operate as a constant reminder that our lives of filthy richness produce what society views as a dirty excesses.====

Waste and Culture of Excess  It is already a commonplace interpretation that waste is the

Civilization is built,  history is driven . . . . (287)  
Waste in its various figurations is not a static, passive object. It traverses 
AND
something that sustains our life but can never really be claimed as ours?

====Oh the urbanity%21 Our shit burbs%21 In these overlooked spaces our leftover food, tires, and baby diapers decompose in landfills, producing methane and other gasses. These excess gasses are of course the very thing we use to power our glowing cities and trash producing homes.  This symptom of the modern world can be and is being used to produce electricity.====

====This year~’s resolution calls for us to change our relationship to energy production. Most people will do it to help &amp;#34;Nature.&amp;#34; But there is a larger question that first must be answered: What is nature?====

====NATURE DOES NOT EXIST—Fantasies of a perfect sphere of nature perverted and destroyed by human~’s overconsumption is NOT an authentic description of the world; engaging with waste as a site of the Real allows for us to engage with the world in a meaningful way which revels in the condition of postmodern destruction====

====And, modern Aesthetics are so overused that we consider all things beautiful as garbage.

===Part 2—the Man Behind the Curtain ===

====In contemporary ideology &amp;#34;nature&amp;#34; has come to stand in as the Big Other; the source of the symbolic structure that gives us meaning.  As such &amp;#34;nature&amp;#34; is not reducible to its contents.  Like the stick figure over a bathroom door turning the materiality of a room with a sink into a gendered &amp;#34;men~’s room,&amp;#34; the idea of &amp;#34;nature&amp;#34; asserts normative force over our lives====

This our response to ALL political problems and makes global ecocide and nuclear annihilation inevitable.

====Contention 1 is Nature====

====This year~’s resolution calls for us to change our relationship to energy production. Most people will do it to help something called &amp;#34;Nature.&amp;#34; But there is a larger question that first must be answered: What is this Nature we talk about, and what do we mean when we say we want to preserve it?====

====NATURE DOES NOT EXIST PRIOR TO HUMAN CONCEPTION—Fantasies of harmony and Edenic nature are not natural; nature fails to exist external to human understanding and particular power relations. ====
**Huang 2009** (Han-Yu, Asst. Prof. English, National Taiwan Normal University, &amp;#34;Trauma, Paranoia, and Ecological Fantasy in Don DeLillo~’s Underworld: Toward a Psychoanalytic Ethics of Waste,&amp;#34; Literary and Cultural Studies, 35.1 March 2009: 109-130) CJQ
As the recognition of the non-existence of the Other―namely, there 
AND

====But conceiving nature as an objective truth creates a social order that disavows nonhuman actors, creates scientific censorship, and is a discursive feedback loop that reaffies our relationship to nature—Precluding any policy response. ====

One of the more animated contemporary debates in human geography concerns the critique of the 
AND
mere external materiality, accessible to us in some unmediated or prediscursive form.

====This is particularly problematic in the context of ecological catastrophe. The discourses predicting environmental apocalypse ignore that the environment is simply one series of apocalypses after another: Extinctions, pollution, toxification, and urbanization are processes of nature and denying them their everyday quality serves to rally societies together and prevent them from questioning the System in which they live. At the heart of this beautiful thing we call nature, in which we speak of violence and order, is founded upon mass extinction and continuous death of unfortunate species—This condition at the heart of natural processes goes ignored by modern society. ====
**Valdivielso 2009** (Joacquin, Prof. Moral Philosophy at Universidat de Illes Balears, New School University, School for Social Research, Political Theory Seminar, Dec. 8 2009, &amp;#34;Discourses of Global Environmental Justice&amp;#34;) CJQ
The second phenomenon I want to refer to is the role of panic as a 
AND
. I will call this the panic effect of pro-climate politics.


====And so we encounter the problem of the metaphysics of space and place.====

====Problematizing nature is the epitome of the space/place dichotomy. Nature exists simultaneously as an object, a space that we inhabit, the site of a collective subjectivity, but also as a place, that object space over to the corner, that creek over the mountain. Since Hegel and Schelling Western metaphysics have relied on this ecological division without confronting its most central confusion. ====

====The impact is a total inability to comprehend Nature as either a space or a place, this thing we see and that thing we think about. This binary metaphysics of presence obscures that objectivity is unknowable, and occludes the subjectivity of particular things in space.  ====
**Wainwright %26 Barnes 09**

It is not our aim to parse this debate here. Rather, our intention 
AND
conception of space as the natural, infinite totality within which we exist.

====Prioritizing the subjectivity of each place fails to recognize the way the space influences and changes the particularities of the place. ====

Many geographers and political ecologists have examined the ways that conceptions of place and nature 
AND
endless expanse of space—unless place is defended¶ by subaltern groups.

====It is within this history of space and place that we encounter nature—Deconstructing the distinction between subject and object offers us the chance to rethink the meaning of ecology itself. Because nature is at once a space and a place, it exposes the momentary breakdown in Western metaphysics itself—Escaping totalization, we encounter a site for ethical responsibility. ====

Braun~’s specific impetus for these claims is to spark a new conception of British¶ 
AND
joined in difference, and frame our experience¶ of nature and existence.

====Our task as ethical subjects is to challenge what we perceive as possible in the status quo to forge an impossible nature-to-come.  This ethical spirit within the 1AC is indeterminately more important than the particular decision we choose to make—Ecology is a call from the other, and we are compelled to give a response. Only this offers the chance for political agency and action.====
**Thomson ~’5** Alex Thomson, lecturer in English at the University of Glasgow, Deconstruction and Democracy, 2005, p. 201-202
Deconstruction, I have argued, is an attempt to describe this economy, the 
AND
to the impossibility of patience, and the possibility of a productive impatience.


===1AC 2===


====Contention 2 is the City-Space/Place====

====Contemporary society takes this metaphysical construction of nature as beautiful and harmonious, and then abstracts that into a totalizing otherness—Nature is presented as quote &amp;#34;the space without the city, that place where trash does not belong.&amp;#34; This gives waste the radical potential to deconstruct metaphysical commitments. ====
**Moore 2011** (Sarah A., Asst. Prof. Latin American Studies and Geography, &amp;#34;Garbage matters: Concepts in new geographies of waste,&amp;#34; Progress in Human Geographies, 2011) CJQ
Rather than being about waste, per se, disposal is about placing and is 
AND
the usual practices of distancing it from particular places (Moore, 2008). 

====Our deconstructive ethic of openness breaks down ideologies of divison and sameness: In the course of urban life, cities become something larger than merely the sum of their parts, taking on a life of their own: They are their own beings, inclusive of all their parts—The radical otherization of waste encountered within the late neoliberal consensus of recycling forces an artificial division between nature and the urban space. ====

We can now state that cities – furthermore, we can extrapolate to the whole 
AND
which does not ¶ oppose nature, but is inherently part of it.

====Waste is the &amp;#34;dirty little secret&amp;#34; of modern society—Everything is founded upon the production of infinite piles of waste, left to rot and burn beneath the sun. As such, it remains a record of ethical atrocities—Where we place it, who consumed it—And accordingly, it is imbued with massive ethical potential. ====
