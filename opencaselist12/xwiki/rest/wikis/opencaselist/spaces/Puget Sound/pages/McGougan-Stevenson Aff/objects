====Our world is composed of a complex assortment of interacting force-fields, each following their own rules and working to their own tempo, continually being driven by their interactions and contradictions with other fields.  A human is just one small piece in a play of forces involving solar energy, tectonic plate shifts, ocean currents, asteroid showers, earthquakes, volcanos, species evolutions and extinctions, rainstorms, tornadoes, and hurricanes. ====&#xD;
&#xD;
====Unfortunately, this world is in jeopardy.  Anthropogenic climate change poses an unmistakable danger to life of all kinds on Earth.  At stake are the very life cycle processes relied upon by humans and nonhumans alike.====&#xD;

====Our world is composed of an unimaginable complexity of interacting force-fields, each following their own rules and working to their own tempo, continually being driven by their interactions and contradictions with other fields.  The human is but one small piece in a play of forces involving solar energy, tectonic plate shifts, ocean currents, asteroid showers, earthquakes, volcanos, species evolutions and extinctions, rainstorms, tornadoes, and hurricanes. ====&#xD;
&#xD;
====However, human influence is accelerating in dangerous ways, such as increasing emissions of green-house gases into the air, trapping heat within the atmosphere, severely disturbing the prior functioning of ecological processes.  We should take two things from this.  First, humanity is not alone on the earth.  We are surrounded not only by other critters, but also inorganic pulses of energy and matter with unmistakable impact on our lives.  In fact, humanity itself is not closed; it too is open, changing, continuously including and excluding.  Second, we still carry a disproportionate influence on things—this complex world of becoming is radically fragile, open to change, for better or for worse.  And thus our social realities are also malleable, contestable, and fragile.====&#xD;
&#xD;
====Amidst all these diffuse networks, vectors, and multiplicities, it~’s hard to believe that some still hold onto ~’total~’ and ~’whole~’ accounts of being and identity, but if the last 10 years of military interventions social oppressions tell us anything, it~’s that these totalizing world-views live on, and produce vengefulness and ressentiment when they encounter difference, leading to massive, unflinching exercises of violence. &amp;#34;They&amp;#34; killed 3,000 people who happened to reside within the same geographic boundaries as us, so &amp;#34;we&amp;#34; re-raised by invading two of their countries, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of thousands (at least).  All this destruction because an impossible number of contingent factors aligned to pit two stratified social fields against each other, both trapped in absolutist ideology and unwilling to see change.====&#xD;
&#xD;
====These are the stakes of leftist politics today.  We can either resign ourselves to stratified fundamentalism or take a risk on a new strategy to contest environmental destruction, combining critical thought, social interaction, and institutional engagement. Affirm the plan as an experiment in political becoming.====&#xD;

====Praxis can be hard.  In all our critiquing, destabilizing, and disrupting, we risk losing sight of the important goals our critiques suggest—the material changes necessary to reorient institutions and social relations in less violent fashions. This obviates particular strategies for change in conjunction with broadening our theoretical lenses.====&#xD;

All this destruction because an impossible number of contingent factors aligned to pit two stratified social fields against each other, both trapped in absolutist ideology and unwilling to see change.====&#xD;
&#xD;
====These are the stakes of leftist politics today.  We can either resign ourselves to stratified fundamentalism or take a risk on a new strategy to contest environmental destruction, combining critical thought, social interaction, and institutional engagement in a politics of becoming.  ====&#xD;
**Connolly ~’11** William E. Connolly, Krieger-Eisenhower Professor of Political Science at Johns Hopkins University, A World of Becoming, 2011, p. 5-8&#xD;
A force-field, roughly speaking, is any energized pattern in slow or &#xD;
AND&#xD;
of spirituality, economics, political action, poetic experience, and ethics.&#xD;
&#xD;
====Praxis can be hard.  In all our critiquing, destabilizing, and disrupting, we risk losing sight of the important goals our critiques suggest—the material changes necessary to reorient institutions and social relations in less violent fashions. This obviates particular strategies for change in conjunction with broadening our theoretical lenses.====&#xD;

If I get worked up about these issues, then this is because I think &#xD;

====We should stop treating structures as unmovable wholes—all it takes is one crack to expose the fragility of oppressive institutions.  The plan is a radical experiment in democratic politics.====&#xD;

A philosophy attending to the acceleration, expansion, irrationalities, interdependencies and fragilities of &#xD;
AND&#xD;
it. The following tentative judgments and sites of action may be pertinent.&#xD;
&#xD;
====Role playing as the government to improve the ways we produce energy and contest climate change has a radical potential.  The 1AC affirms a militant pluralist assemblage tasked with exploring new strategies for reducing inequality and changing human interaction with our so-called ~’environment.~’====&#xD;

3.    Today, perhaps the initial target should be on reconstituting established patterns of &#xD;
AND&#xD;
, role performance, cultural ethos, market regulation, and citizen activism.&#xD;
&#xD;
====The consequences of climate change should not be underestimated or ignored for the sake of ~’theoretical purity.~’ Social theory must redirect its analytical attention to climate science—refusal risks complicity with the worst violence====&#xD;

There is a mystery in this lack of interest in developments that could conceivably open &#xD;
AND&#xD;
worse – an effective complicity with the vested interests of fossil fuel corporations.&#xD;

**IB Times ~’11** (International Business Times, Mike Adams – author and journalist, Solar Flare Could Unleash Nuclear Holocaust Across Planet Earth, Forcing Hundreds of Nuclear Power Plants Into Total Meltdowns, [[http://au.ibtimes.com/articles/213249/20110914/solar-flare-could-unleash-nuclear-holocaust-across-planet-earth-forcing-hundreds-of-nuclear-power-pl.htm-http://au.ibtimes.com/articles/213249/20110914/solar-flare-could-unleash-nuclear-holocaust-across-planet-earth-forcing-hundreds-of-nuclear-power-pl.htm]], AV)&#xD;
 But here~’s the real issue: There are 700 nuclear power facilities in the world, remember? Let~’s suppose that in the aftermath of a massive solar flare, the nations of the world are somehow able to control half of those facilities and nurse them into cold shutdown status. That still leaves roughly 350 nuclear facilities at risk. Now let~’s suppose half of those are somehow luckily offline and not even functioning when the solar flare hits, so they need no special attention. This is a very optimistic assumption, but that still leaves 175 nuclear power plants where all attempts fail. Let~’s be outrageously optimistic and suppose that a third of those somehow don~’t go into a total meltdown by some miracle of God, or some bizarre twist in the laws of physics. So we~’re still left with 115 nuclear power plants that &amp;#34;go Chernobyl.&amp;#34; Fukushima was one power plant. Imagine the devastation of 100+ nuclear power plants, all going into meltdown all at once across the planet. It~’s not the loss of electricity that~’s the real problem; it~’s the global tidal wave of invisible radiation that blankets the planet, permeates the topsoil, irradiates everything that breathes and delivers the final crushing blow to human civilization as we know it today. Because if you have 100 simultaneous global nuclear meltdowns, the tidal wave of radiation will make farming nearly impossible for years. That means no food production for several years in a row. And that, in turn, means a near-total collapse of the human population on our planet. How many people can survive an entire year with no food from the farms? Not one in a hundred people. Even beyond that, how many people can essentially live underground and be safe enough from the radiation that they can have viable children and repopulate the planet? It~’s a very, very small fraction of the total population. Solar flares far more likely to hit nuclear power plants than tidal waves or earthquakes What~’s the chance of all this actually happening? A report by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory said that &amp;#34;...over the standard 40-year license term of nuclear power plants, solar flare activity enables a 33 percent chance of long-term power loss, a risk that significantly outweighs that of major earthquakes and tsunamis.&amp;#34; ([[http://www.IBTimes.com/articles/194-http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/194]]...) The world~’s reliance on nuclear power, you see, has doomed us to destroy our own civilization. Of course, this is all preventable if we would only dismantle and shut down ALL nuclear power plants on the planet. But what are the chances of that happening? Zero, of course. There are too many commercial and political interests invested in nuclear power. So the power plants will stay, and we will therefore be vulnerable to a solar flare which could strike us at any time and unleash a global nuclear holocaust. Planet Earth has been struck by solar flares before, of course, but all the big hits in recorded human history took place long before the age of modern electronics, so the impacts were minimal. Today, society cannot function without electronics. Nor can nuclear facility coolant pumps. Once you realize that, you begin to understand the true danger in which humanity has placed itself by relying on nuclear power. By relying on nuclear power, we are risking everything. And we~’re doing it blindly, with no real acknowledgement of the dangers of running 700+ nuclear facilities in a constant state of &amp;#34;near meltdown&amp;#34; while foolishly relying on the steady flow of electricity to keep the fuel rods cool. If Fukushima, all by itself, could unleash a tidal wave of deadly radiation all by itself, imagine a world where hundreds of nuclear facilities go into a total meltdown simultaneously.&#xD;

====Risk of extinction outweighs – even if probability of our scenario is low, the capability to bounce back from lesser catastrophes means they don~’t matter as much====

In particular, the federal government remains enthralled by notions of &amp;#34;linearity&amp;#34;. That 
AND
tolerance for uncertainty—that is all too rare in today~’s political discourse.

====Imagining hypothetical scenarios is key to carrying an exploration of lived complexity into practical application====
**Kavalski ~’7** Emilian Kavalski, &amp;#34;The fifth debate and the emergence of complex international relations theory: notes on the application of complexity theory to the study of real life,&amp;#34; Cambridge Review of International Affairs, vol. 20 iss. 3, 2007, 10.1080/09557570701574154

Makhijani ~’12 Arjun Makhijani, electrical and nuclear engineer, President of the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research, has served as an expert witness in Nuclear Regulatory Commission Proceedings, &amp;#34;Is Thorium A Magic Bullet For Our Energy Problems?&amp;#34; interviewed by Ira Flatow, host of Science Friday, NPR, 5/4/2012, http://www.npr.org/2012/05/04/152026805/is-thorium-a-magic-bullet-for-our-energy-problems-http://www.npr.org/2012/05/04/152026805/is-thorium-a-magic-bullet-for-our-energy-problems 
This isn~’t going to happen tomorrow, even if you pour money into it. It would take 10 years for the NRC to understand and write regulations for this thing. And it would take 10 years before that to build the reactors, do the experiments and produce the data so you can regulate this thing, because all of our regulation is based on light water reactors.

====Perm do both means states fund DoD purchasing – otherwise they don~’t fiat power gets to the bases====
GAO 9, &amp;#34;Defense Infrastructure: DOD Needs to Take Actions to Address Challenges in Meeting Federal 
Renewable Energy Goals&amp;#34;, December, http://www.gao.gov/assets/300/299755.html
DOD has also joined with private sector entities, entering into various types of arrangements 
AND
several different types of these approaches that have resulted in renewable energy projects.

====Current acquisitions favor old tech – the plan~’s signal is key====

In our final discussion, we consider the end of the innovation pipeline—deployment

innovative technologies on its installations provides a clear demand signal to the developer.

====DOD bypasses and solves licensing lag====
CSPO 10, Consortium for Science, Policy and Outcomes at ASU, &amp;#34;four policy principles for energy innovation %26 climate change: a synthesis&amp;#34;, June, http://www.catf.us/resources/publications/files/Synthesis.pdf
Government purchase of new technologies is a powerful way to accelerate innovation through increased demand 
AND
innovation. Public procurement of other renewable energy technologies could be similarly important.

====Only military SMR~’s will be usable on bases====

Structural trauma is infected by the sublime—it is simultaneously the site of terror and ecstasy.  By understanding the historical trauma of slavery as constitutive of the Black body slavery is rendered sublime.  Thus, the experience of slavery (both as historical event and as ongoing violence) becomes aestheticized, as the slave becomes a sort of divine figure and the locus of our juissance.   Slavery &amp;#34;remembered&amp;#34; in this way is divorced from its cause and ethical significance—It is &amp;#34;without consequence&amp;#34;.

March 11 2011—Japan is hit by the largest earthquake in history.  The biggest earthquake begets the biggest tsunami.  The tsunami begets the Fukashima Daichi nuclear disaster—over the next weeks the buildings around three separate boiling water reactors explode.

Although high school debate is often considered the thinking person~’s—the nerd~’s—alternative

1870—Standard Oil is formed
1942—Enrico Firmi successful demonstrates the ideas of science fiction author and peace activist Leó Szilárd, creating the first sustained nuclear reaction.
1965—Oak Ridge conducts the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment under the direction of PWR and BWR inventor Alvin Weinberg.  This reactor promises a new direction that is passively safe, cannot meltdown, requires no uranium mining, and is not useful in the creation of nuclear weapons.

What if we could turn back the clock to 1965 and have an energy do

elements. Instead power is needed to prevent the shutdown of the reactor.
May 15 1911—Standard oil is declared a monopoly by the Supreme Court, and broken up.
June 13 1917—Phillips petroleum is founded.
1973—Alvin Weinberg is fired for advocating designs that do not produce weapons usable plutonium and for continuing to talk about nuclear safety.  One year later, he publishes an article in Science about the possibility for CO2 caused warming

James Powell was inspired to write this important new book because of a remarkable paradox

1979—NFL Nationals.  A representative from Phillips petroleum watches a debate round and is shocked by what he sees.  In response LD is created as an activity focused solely on values.  A rift is created, one that continually reappears in different forms—values vs policy, policy vs critique, lay vs experienced.  A new influx of petro dollars ensures the segregation of these models while this basic segregation is replicated throughout the discourse of our society

I~’m not disputing the very real synthetic intelligence of many of Extemp~’s participants, but 
AND
politicians speak very, very slowly about values utterly disconnected from their policies.
This abandonment of the ground of contestation over values—the acceptance of the technocratic grounds for the debate—has a particularly profound impact in these environmental questions.  Acceptance of pure policy debate makes corporate domination inevitable
**Huber ~’11** Matthew T. Huber, &amp;#34;Gusher in the Gulf and the Despotism of Capital,&amp;#34; Antipode, Volume 43, Issue 2, pages 195–198, March 2011, DOI: 10.1111/j.1467-8330.2010.00806.x
One of the most disheartening aspects of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico 
AND
It is~~ the tendency of capital to give production a scientific character.
Don~’t mistake our (counter) history of debate as a plea to LD, to running slow or even the k.  We are interested in the segregation that has occurred between these modes of arguments.   For, the retreat to the realm of pure critique, pure tearing down, pure value, has also served the interests of domination, and nowhere is this more obvious than in energy policy

Saturday Evening 1995 – Ben returns home

It~’s time we brought values and policy back together—time that the critique stopped being a tool for only tearing things down—time that we stop segregating ourselves into wonks and philosophers, scientists and poets—time that we come together

of the complex, interdependent qualities of all environments, human and nonhuman.
Perhaps energy policy doesn~’t have to be only a metaphor for things going wrong.  Maybe energy provides a radical potential for rethinking debate.  When Fermi built that pit, and Weinberger built that vat of molten salt, something magical happened.  Those devices went critical.  Not critical in the sense of tearing things down—of showing the wrong assumptions behind everything.  But, critical in the sense of producing more than you put in, of throwing high energy particles every which way, of transmuting matter, of creation.  A kritik that incorporates—that plays with technocracy—that includes stories about Alvin Winberger and the occasional technocratic acronym.  
Resolved: The United States Federal Government should substantially reduce restrictions on and/or substantially increase financial incentives for energy production of nuclear power from this debate.
**Latour ~’4** Bruno Latour, Professor and vice-president for research at Sciences Po Paris, &amp;#34;Why Has Critique Run out of Steam? From Matters of Fact to Matters of Concern,&amp;#34; Critical Inquiry 30, Winter 2004
The practical problem we face, if we try to go that new route, 
AND
, deploy them.&amp;#34; Then we would have gone for good beyond iconoclasm.
Sarah Palin doesn~’t define the only way to be slow.  Despite how fast we talk in debates, there is always a paradoxical element of delay in this activity.   Rounds at national championships often take 3 plus hours from pairing to decisions.   Nor is this only in debate: a new slow speech emerged at Zucotti park in the form of the human microphone.  Collective repetition presents a new avenue for challenging corporate domination.   The ballot can take on this roll.   Our aff does not challenge within the conventional language of the policy aff or the K aff because we need a new language if we want to break from our rhetorical impasse.  Repeat us.  Serve as our microphone.

It is a stubborn slowness that appeals to so many &amp;#34;spread&amp;#34; Americans,

The stakes could not be higher. Political discourse reduced to pure values, packaged in slow and stupefied soundbites on Fox News accompany a disastrous slide toward conservative politics.

Black’s Law Dictionary 79 (Fifth Edition, p. 1237)
Should. The past tense of shall; ordinarily implying duty or obligation; although usually no more than an obligation of propriety or expediency, or a moral obligation, thereby distinguishing it from “ought.” It is not normally synonymous with “may,” and although often interchangeable with the word “would,” it does not ordinarily express certainty as “will” sometimes does
 “Resolved” means law
Words and Phrases 64 (Permanent Edition)

Definition of the word “resolve,” given by Webster is “to express an opinion or determination by resolution or vote; as ‘it was resolved by the legislature;” It is of similar force to the word “enact,” which is defined by Bouvier as meaning “to establish by law”.
QER links to elections/politics –  requires transparency and presidential involvement
PCAST 10
President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST), Executive Office of the President, Co-Chaired by John P. Holdren, Assistant to the President for Science and Technology Director, Office of Science and Technology Policy, and Eric Lander, President, Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Nov 2010, REPORT TO THE PRESIDENT ON ACCELERATING THE PACE OF CHANGE IN ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES THROUGH AN INTEGRATED FEDERAL ENERGY POLICY, www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/pcast-energy-tech-report.pdf

A QER process would, in some sense, formulate an integrated energy policy for the twenty­first century. It will span mission and vision definition, strategy, and tactics. The QER and the process leading to it would provide an effective tool for Administration­wide coherence on energy and for effective dialog with Congress on a coordinated legislative agenda. Presidential interest and engagement will be a necessary ingredient for success.
While the QER will be a product of the Administration, substantial input from the Congress, the energy industry, academia, state and local governments, nongovernmental organizations, and consumers will be essential throughout the process. Transparency in the process of gathering input for the QER will be key to the development of a sound product that can gain wide support.

Attempts at global economic reform could also lead to a world racked by increasing turbulence, a greater sense of insecurity among the major centres of power – and hence to a further tightening of the structures of domination and domestic repression – producing in their wake an intensification of the old arms race and militarization of regimes, encouraging regional conflagrations and setting the stage for eventual global holocaust.

Impact is waves of nuclear meltdowns—causes extinction

But here~’s the real issue: There are 700 nuclear power facilities in the world, remember? Let~’s suppose that in the aftermath of a massive solar flare, the nations of the world are somehow able to control half of those facilities and nurse them into cold shutdown status. That still leaves roughly 350 nuclear facilities at risk. Now let~’s suppose half of those are somehow luckily offline and not even functioning when the solar flare hits, so they need no special attention. This is a very optimistic assumption, but that still leaves 175 nuclear power plants where all attempts fail. Let~’s be outrageously optimistic and suppose that a third of those somehow don~’t go into a total meltdown by some miracle of God, or some bizarre twist in the laws of physics. So we~’re still left with 115 nuclear power plants that &amp;#34;go Chernobyl.&amp;#34; Fukushima was one power plant. Imagine the devastation of 100+ nuclear power plants, all going into meltdown all at once across the planet. It~’s not the loss of electricity that~’s the real problem; it~’s the global tidal wave of invisible radiation that blankets the planet, permeates the topsoil, irradiates everything that breathes and delivers the final crushing blow to human civilization as we know it today. Because if you have 100 simultaneous global nuclear meltdowns, the tidal wave of radiation will make farming nearly impossible for years. That means no food production for several years in a row. And that, in turn, means a near-total collapse of the human population on our planet. How many people can survive an entire year with no food from the farms? Not one in a hundred people. Even beyond that, how many people can essentially live underground and be safe enough from the radiation that they can have viable children and repopulate the planet? It~’s a very, very small fraction of the total population. Solar flares far more likely to hit nuclear power plants than tidal waves or earthquakes What~’s the chance of all this actually happening? A report by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory said that &amp;#34;...over the standard 40-year license term of nuclear power plants, solar flare activity enables a 33 percent chance of long-term power loss, a risk that significantly outweighs that of major earthquakes and tsunamis.&amp;#34; (http://www.IBTimes.com/articles/194-http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/194...) The world~’s reliance on nuclear power, you see, has doomed us to destroy our own civilization. Of course, this is all preventable if we would only dismantle and shut down ALL nuclear power plants on the planet. But what are the chances of that happening? Zero, of course. There are too many commercial and political interests invested in nuclear power. So the power plants will stay, and we will therefore be vulnerable to a solar flare which could strike us at any time and unleash a global nuclear holocaust. Planet Earth has been struck by solar flares before, of course, but all the big hits in recorded human history took place long before the age of modern electronics, so the impacts were minimal. Today, society cannot function without electronics. Nor can nuclear facility coolant pumps. Once you realize that, you begin to understand the true danger in which humanity has placed itself by relying on nuclear power. By relying on nuclear power, we are risking everything. And we~’re doing it blindly, with no real acknowledgement of the dangers of running 700+ nuclear facilities in a constant state of &amp;#34;near meltdown&amp;#34; while foolishly relying on the steady flow of electricity to keep the fuel rods cool. If Fukushima, all by itself, could unleash a tidal wave of deadly radiation all by itself, imagine a world where hundreds of nuclear facilities go into a total meltdown simultaneously.

NDAA diminishes ignition research funding—balanced with lower-yield SSP and other priorities
**Jones ~’13** Richard M. Jones, &amp;#34;FY 2013 National Defense Authorization Act: National Ignition Facility, CMRR,&amp;#34; AIP Bulletin of Science Policy News, 1/17/2013, http://www.aip.org/fyi/2013/012.html
President Barack Obama has signed into law H.R. 4310, the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2013. This legislation provides policy and budget guidance for the Department of Defense and the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA). It does not provide the actual funding, which is contained in the yet to be enacted FY 2013 Department of Defense Appropriations Bill. The conference report (http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CRPT-112hrpt705/pdf/CRPT-112hrpt705.pdf) has language on the National Ignition Facility and the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Replacement Facility (CMRR). The report language briefly summarizes the respective positions of the House and Senate authorizing committees regarding a particular section of their bill and explains the final position each chamber~’s conferees took in resolving the matter. The &amp;#34;sec.&amp;#34; number refers to the actual bill text. National Ignition Facility: &amp;#34;Limitation on availability of funds for inertial confinement fusion ignition and high yield campaign &amp;#34;The House bill contained a provision (sec. 3119) that would limit the obligation and expenditure of funds for fusion ignition research and experiments to not more than 50 percent until the Administrator for Nuclear Security certifies to the congressional defense committees that fusion ignition has been achieved at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) or the Administrator submits a report on fusion ignition. &amp;#34;The Senate amendment contained no similar provision. &amp;#34;The House recedes ~~withdraws from its position.~~ &amp;#34;The conferees are pleased that the National Nuclear Security Administration has submitted the report required in section 3119 of the House bill regarding a path forward for the NIF, including fusion ignition. The conferees believe that the NIF should continue to balance the goal of achieving ignition with other stockpile needs as part of the life extension programs as well as ongoing work for other agencies and offices in the Department of Energy.&amp;#34;
NIF should expand inquiry into direct-drive IFE
