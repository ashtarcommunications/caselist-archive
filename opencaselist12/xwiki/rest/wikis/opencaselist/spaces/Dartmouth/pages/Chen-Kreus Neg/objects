No nation has ever grown so rapidly as China is growing now, and no nation has had to address such daunting environmental challenges at the same time as it has pursued such rapid growth.218 This poses major hurdles to tackling climate change that must be surmounted by nations working together. And there are not just two nations involved, but the whole world.219 The planet is in peril if we do not all act together with concerted, targeted efforts. Ra- ther than creating a two-nation race, we should encourage China’s domestic policies and the climate change collaborations of the “BRIC” developing economies (Brazil, Russia, and India, in addition to China).220 Nationalistic rhetoric on climate change (as best embodied in the USTR investigation) will have high costs. Creating near-term tension would be especially unfortunate for the U.S.-China relationship on climate matters, which is complex, but not marked by the same animosity as Amer- ica’s relationship with the U.S.S.R. in the 1950s. The two nations have occasionally criticized each other’s progress toward reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and China is not reticent about highlighting its stronger pro- grams (greentech promotion) and downplaying weaker ones (lack of bind- ing nationwide emissions limits).221 The two nations have ongoing tensions on a whole host of sensitive topics,222 but have worked productively with each other to address climate change.223 Some note that collaboration on climate issues could have a positive impact on the entire U.S.-China dialo- gue,224 although the USTR investigation threatens that optimistic out- look.225 In the two-year period of international negotiations between the prom- ulgation of the Bali Action Plan and the December 2009 Copenhagen summit, there were numerous cooperative activities between the two na- tions. The highest level of talks took place under the auspices of the U.S.- China Strategic and Economic Dialogue.226 Discussions also took place during 2009 with other world leaders at the Pittsburgh G-20 summit227 and the Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate.228 There was even talk during 2009 of the two nations forming a sort of “G-2” to cooperate on financial and climate matters, though that never materialized.229 The two nations have pledged several times to take mutual action to address climate change,230 and while the promises are often hortatory, the ongoing discus- sion does have important value in strengthening the bilateral relation- ship.231 Continued antagonistic rhetoric about a clean energy race will make it difficult to conduct cooperative efforts in energy and environmental mat- ters. Unlike the near-complete scientific secrecy that marked the Cold War era, advocating a strategy of competition with the Chinese undercuts these activities. 232 China and the United States are working to develop technology together. Under the China-U.S. Science and Technology Agreement, the Department of Energy has twelve ongoing initiatives with China,233 includ- ing electric vehicle234 and carbon capture and storage development initia- tives.235 The Clean Energy Ministerial Forum in July 2010, hosted by U.S. Secretary of Energy Steven Chu and attended by his Chinese counterpart and ministers from twenty-two other nations, outlined a multi-part agenda in specific areas of cooperation.236 Similar to Norway, which saw coopera- tion in fishing matters cut off by an aggrieved China after the award of a Nobel Prize to a Chinese dissident,237 Some even argue (in obvious counterpoint to the USTR investiga- tion) that China’s subsidies and other programs to promote renewables can be good for the United States’ economy. the United States could find itself shunned by China in these highly symbolic areas instead of cooperating with it. 238 The Council on Foreign Rela- tions’ Michael Levi, examining the study cited earlier in this Article that the United States retains leadership at the high value end of the solar devel- opment and manufacturing chain,239 argues that “it’s quite possible for the United States and China both to win, with China lowering the cost of rela- tively low-tech parts of the value chain, in turn growing the market for the higher-tech parts that are still handled by the United States.”240 Levi com- pares this to other situations in which China manufactures products devel- oped in the United States. Some might find that overstated, and others cite feedback loops like the one described earlier in this Article (in which Chi- nese firms eventually find their way up the value chain).241 On the other hand, warring with China can only hurt the prospects for American firms to do business in China.242 At the international level, greentech warring makes it even more diffi- cult to reach a global climate agreement. Many have chastised China for taking insufficient steps toward an agreement limiting greenhouse gas emissions. According to some accounts, China’s foot-dragging and re- fusal to adopt binding reduction targets was at least in part responsible for the failure of the Copenhagen Accord to incorporate global binding lim- its,244 although the United States shares some blame for putting forth a weak negotiating position. As China’s economy continues its rapid growth, there will be even greater demand for it to agree to limit emissions.245 Cas- tigating it for its greentech policies could foster a climate of distrust and delay further progress on a post-Kyoto agreement. For example, it would not take much for Senators who oppose international climate agreements to blame the Chinese as a reason for refusing to agree to any such agreement (a prerequisite for it to go into effect in the United States),246 as they al- ready have done once before with a resolution opposing ratification of the Kyoto Protocol.247 The rhetoric of a green energy race could give cover for this regrettable posturing. And this ideology makes environmental and economic collapse and resource wars inevitable Bristow (School of City and Regional Planning, Cardiff University) 10 (Gillian, Resilient regions: re-‘place’ing regional competitiveness, Cambridge Journal of Regions, Economy and Society 2010, 3, 153–167) In recent years, regional development strategies have been subjugated to the hegemonic discourse of competitiveness, such that the ultimate objective for all regional development policy-makers and practitioners has become the creation of economic advantage through superior productivity performance, or the attraction of new ﬁrms and labour (Bristow, 2005). A major consequence is the developing ‘ubiquitiﬁcation’ of regional development strategies (Bristow, 2005; Maskell and Malmberg, 1999). This reﬂects the status of competitiveness as a key discursive construct (Jessop, 2008) that has acquired hugely signiﬁcant rhetorical power for certain interests intent on reinforcing capitalist relations (Bristow, 2005; Fougner, 2006). Indeed, the competitiveness hegemony is such that many policies previously considered only indirectly relevant to unfettered economic growth tend to be hijacked in support of competitiveness agendas (for example Raco, 2008; also Dannestam, 2008). This paper will argue, however, that a particularly narrow discourse of ‘competitiveness’ has been constructed that has a number of negative connotations for the ‘resilience’ of regions. Resilience is deﬁned as the region’s ability to experience positive economic success that is socially inclusive, works within environmental limits and which can ride global economic punches (Ashby et al., 2009). As such, resilience clearly resonates with literatures on sustainability, localisation and diversiﬁcation, and the developing understanding of regions as intrinsically diverse entities with evolutionary and context-speciﬁc development trajectories (Hayter, 2004). In contrast, the dominant discourse of competitiveness is ‘placeless’ and increasingly associated with globalised, growth-ﬁrst and environmentally malign agendas (Hudson, 2005). However, this paper will argue that the relationships between competitiveness and resilience are more complex than might at ﬁrst appear. Using insights from the Cultural Political Economy (CPE) approach, which focuses on understanding the construction, development and spread of hegemonic policy discourses, the paper will argue that the dominant discourse of competitiveness used in regional development policy is narrowly constructed and is thus insensitive to contingencies of place and the more nuanced role of competition within economies. This leads to problems of resilience that can be partly overcome with the development of a more contextualised approach to competitiveness. The paper is now structured as follows. It begins by examining the developing understanding of resilience in the theorising and policy discourse around regional development. It then describes the CPE approach and utilises its framework to explain both how a narrow conception of competitiveness has come to dominate regional development policy and how resilience inter-plays in subtle and complex ways with competitiveness and its emerging critique. The paper then proceeds to illustrate what resilience means for regional development ﬁrstly, with reference to the Transition Towns concept, and then by developing a typology of regional strategies to show the different characteristics of policy approaches based on competitiveness and resilience. Regional resilience Resilience is rapidly emerging as an idea whose time has come in policy discourses around localities and regions, where it is developing widespread appeal owing to the peculiarly powerful combination of transformative pressures from below, and various catalytic, crisis-induced imperatives for change from above. It features strongly in policy discourses around environmental management and sustainable development (see Hudson, 2008a), but has also more recently emerged in relation to emergency and disaster planning with, for example ‘Regional Resilience Teams’ established in the English regions to support and co-ordinate civil protection activities around various emergency situations such as the threat of a swine ﬂu pandemic. The discourse of resilience is also taking hold in discussions around desirable local and regional development activities and strategies. The recent global ‘credit crunch’ and the accompanying in-crease in livelihood insecurity has highlighted the advantages of those local and regional economies that have greater ‘resilience’ by virtue of being less dependent upon globally footloose activities, hav-ing greater economic diversity, and/or having a de-termination to prioritise and effect more signiﬁcant structural change (Ashby et al, 2009; Larkin and Cooper, 2009). Indeed, resilience features particular strongly in the ‘grey’ literature spawned by thinktanks, consul-tancies and environmental interest groups around the consequences of the global recession, catastrophic climate change and the arrival of the era of peak oil for localities and regions with all its implications for the longevity of carbon-fuelled economies, cheap, long-distance transport and global trade. This popularly labelled ‘triple crunch’ (New Economics Foundation, 2008) has power-fully illuminated the potentially disastrous material consequences of the voracious growth imperative at the heart of neoliberalism and competitiveness, both in the form of resource constraints (especially food security) and in the inability of the current system to manage global ﬁnancial and ecological sustainability. In so doing, it appears to be galvinising previously disparate, fractured debates about the merits of the current system, and challenging public and political opinion to develop a new, global concern with frugality, egalitarianism and localism (see, for example Jackson, 2009; New Economics Foundation, 2008). Our alternative is to reject the Aff’s endorsement of economic competition Rejecting competition is an act of economic imagination that can create real alternatives within the existing economy White and Williams (senior lecturer of economic geography at Sheffield Hallam University; professor of public policy in the Management School at the University of Sheffield) 12 (Richard J. and Cohn C., Escaping Capitalist Hegemony: Rereading Western Economies in The Accumulation of Freedom, pg. 131-32) The American anarchist Howard Ehrlich argued, &amp;#34;We must act as if the future is today.&amp;#34; What we have hoped to demonstrate here is that non capitalist spaces are present and evident in contemporary societies. We do not need to imagine and create from scratch new economic alternatives that will successfully confront the capitalist hegemony thesis, or more properly the capitalist hegemony myth. Rather than capitalism being the all powerful, all conquering, economic juggernaut, the greater truth is that the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; non capitalist spaces have grown in proportion relative in size to the capitalism realm. This should give many of us great comfort and hope in moving forward purposefully for, as Chomsky observed: &amp;#34;[a]lternatives have to be constructed within the existing economy, and within the minds of working people and communities.&amp;#34;&amp;#39; In this regard, the roots of the heterodox economic futures that we desire do exist in the present. Far from shutting down future economic possibilities, a more accurate reading of &amp;#34;the economic&amp;#34; (which decenters capitalism), coupled with the global crisis that capitalism finds itself in, should give us additional courage and resolve to unleash our economic imaginations, embrace the challenge of creating &amp;#34;fully engaged&amp;#34; economies. These must also take greater account of the disastrous social and environmental costs of capitalism and its inherent ethic of competition. As Kropotkin wrote: Don&amp;#39;t compete! competition is always injurious to the species, and you have plenty of resources to avoid it! Therefore combine practice mutual aid! That is the surest means for giving to each and all to the greatest safety, the best guarantee of existence and progress, bodily, intellectual, and moral .... That is what Nature teaches us; and that is what all those animals which have attained the highest position in the respective classes have done. That is also what man [ski the most primitive man has been doing; and that is why man has reached the position upon which we stand now.&amp;#34; A more detailed and considered discussion of the futures of work, however, is beyond the scope of this chapter. What we have hoped to demonstrate is that in reimagining the economic, and recognizing and valuing the non capitalist economic practices that are already here, we might spark renewed enthusiasm, optimism, insight, and critical discussion within and among anarchist communities. The ambition here is similar to that of Gibson Graham, in arguing that: The objective is not to produce a finished and coherent template that maps the economy &amp;#34;as it really is&amp;#34; and presents... a ready made &amp;#34;alternative economy.&amp;#34; Rather, our hope is to disarm and dislocate the naturalized dominance of the capitalist economy and make a space for new economic beeomings ones that we will need to work to produce. If we can recognize a diverse economy, we can begin to imagine and create diverse organizations and practices as powerful constituents of an enlivened noncapitalist policies of place.

A more detailed and considered discussion of the futures of work, however, is beyond the scope of this chapter. What we have hoped to demonstrate is that in reimagining the economic, and recognizing and valuing the non‑capitalist economic practices that are already here, we might spark renewed enthusiasm, optimism, insight, and critical discussion within and among anarchist communities.

Still, as a recent and fascinating report (pdf) from the Carnegie Endowment explains, Chinese coal imports are likely to grow enormously in the coming years.

According to official statistics, 6,027 Chinese miners died in 2004, though the real number is probably higher. There are real costs to ramping up production in China.

The Aff’s Discourse of Hegemonic Integration Rehashes The Geographies of Exclusion and Barbarism in Nicer Term - The Discourse of “Global Instability” Versus a Stable US Confirm the Hierarchy of Dominant US Identity.
Daavid Campbell et. al. 7, Prof. of Geography @ Durham, ‘7 [Political Geography 26, “Performing security: The imaginative geographies of current US strategy,” p. Wiley]

The concept of integration, invoked in different ways and in different measures by both Kagan and Barnett, is similarly at the heart of the current administration&amp;#39;s foreign and domestic policies. The former Director of Policy at the US State Department, Richard Haass, articulated the central tenets of the concept when he wondered:      Is there a successor idea to containment? I think there is. It is the idea of integration. The goal of US foreign policy should be to persuade the other major powers to sign on to certain key ideas as to how the world should operate: opposition to terrorism and weapons of mass destruction, support for free trade, democracy, markets. Integration is about locking them into these policies and then building institutions that lock them in even more (Haass in Lemann, 1 April 2002, emphasis added).  That the US is no longer prepared to tolerate regimes that do not mirror its own democratic values and practices, and that it will seek to persuade such major powers to change their policies and behaviours to fit the American modus operandi, is not without historical precedent (Ambrosius, 2006). Nor does the differently imagined geography of integration replace completely previous Manichean conceptions of the world so familiar to Cold War politics. Rather, the proliferation of new terms of antipathy such as ‘axis of evil’, ‘rogue states’, and ‘terror cities’ demonstrate how integration goes hand in hand with – and is mutually constitutive of – new forms of division. Barnett&amp;#39;s divide between the globalised world and the non-integrating gap is reflected and complemented by Kagan&amp;#39;s divide in ways of dealing with this state of affairs. Much of this imagined geography pivots on the idea of ‘the homeland’. Indeed, in the imaginations of the security analysts we highlight here, there is a direct relationship and tension between securing the homeland&amp;#39;s borders and challenging the sanctity of borders elsewhere (see Kaplan, 2003: 87).  Appreciating this dynamic requires us to trace some of the recent articulations of US strategy. Since September 11th 2001 the US government and military have issued a number of documents outlining their security strategy. Each recites, reiterates and resignifies both earlier strategic statements as well each other, creating a sense of boundedness and fixity which naturalizes a specific view of the world. Initially there was The National Strategy for Homeland Security (Office of Homeland Security, 2002), and then the much broader scope National Security Strategy (The White House, 2002b; see Der Derian, 2003). These were followed by the “National Strategy for Combating Terrorism” and particular plans for Military Strategy, Defense Strategy and the “Strategy for Homeland Defense and Civil Support” (Department of Defense, 2005a, Department of Defense, 2005b, Joint Chiefs of Staff, 2004 and The White House, 2002a). These are seen as an interlocking whole, where “the National Military Strategy (NMS) supports the aims of the National Security Strategy (NSS) and implements the National Defense Strategy (NDS)” (Joint Chiefs of Staff, 2004: 1); and the “Strategy for Homeland Defense and Civil Support” builds “upon the concept of an active, layered defense outlined in the National Defense Strategy” (Department of Defense, 2005b: iii; see also diagram on 6). The updated National Security Strategy (The White House, 2006) presents a further re-elaboration and re-stating of these principles.  As with the understandings we highlighted previously, it should be noted that key elements of these strategies pre-date September 11. Significant in this continuity is the link between the Bush administration&amp;#39;s strategic view and the 1992 “Defense Planning Guidance” (DPG). Written for the administration of George H. W. Bush by Paul Wolfowitz and I. Lewis ‘Scooter’ Libby, the DPG was the first neoconservative security manifesto for the post-Cold War; a blue print for a one-superpower world in which the US had to be prepared to combat new regional threats and prevent the rise of a hegemonic competitor (Tyler, 8 March 1992; see Mann, 2004: 198ff, 212).  Initial versions of the DPG were deemed too controversial and were rewritten with input from then Defense Secretary Cheney and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs General Colin Powell (Tyler, 24 May 1992). Nonetheless, Cheney&amp;#39;s version still declared that, “we must maintain the mechanism for deterring potential competitors from even aspiring to a larger regional or global role” (Cheney, 1993: 2).  What we find in this is the kernel of the policies implemented in the administration of George W. Bush, reworked through the Clinton period by such organizations as PNAC (discussed above). The assemblage of individuals and organizations – both inside and outside the formal state structures – running from the DPG, through PNAC to the plethora of Bush administration security texts cited above (all of which draw upon well-established US security dispositions in the post-World War II era) demonstrates the performative infrastructure through which certain ontological effects are established, and through which certain performances are made possible and can be understood.  As we argue throughout this paper, the distinctive thing about recent National Security Strategies is their deployment of integration as the principal foreign policy and security strategy. It is telling that Bush&amp;#39;s claim of “either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists” (Bush, 2001) relies not on a straightforward binary, as is sometimes suggested, but a process of incorporation. It is not simply us versus them, but with us, a mode of operating alongside, or, in the words of one of Bush&amp;#39;s most enthusiastic supporters, “shoulder to shoulder” (Blair, 2001; see White and Wintour, 2001). This works more widely through a combination of threats and promises, as in this statement about the Palestinians: “If Palestinians embrace democracy and the rule of law, confront corruption, and firmly reject terror, they can count on American support for the creation of a Palestinian state” (The White House, 2002b: 9). Likewise, it can be found in some of remarks of the British Prime Minister Blair (2004) about the significance of democracy in Afghanistan, Africa and Iraq. Equally Bush&amp;#39;s notorious ‘axis of evil’ speech did not simply name North Korea, Iran and Iraq as its members, but suggested that “states like these, and their terrorist allies, constitute an axis of evil, arming to threaten the peace of the world” (Bush, 2002a, emphasis added). A comparison of the like, alongside the “with the terrorists” is actually a more complicated approach to the choosing of sides and the drawing of lines than is generally credited. Simple binary oppositions are less useful to an understanding here than the process of incorporation and the policy of integration.  These examples indicate the policy of integration or exclusion being adopted by the US and followed by certain allies. It warns those failing to adopt US values (principally liberal ‘representative’ democracy and market capitalism), that they will be excluded from an American-centric world. The place of US allies in these representations is not unimportant. Indeed, the strength of the US discourse relies also on its reflection and reiteration by other key allies, especially in Europe. Above and beyond the dismissive pronouncements of Rumsfeld about Europe&amp;#39;s “Old” and “New” – a conception that was inchoately articulated as early as the 1992 DPG – the dissent of (even some) Europeans is a problem for the US in its world-making endeavours (see Bialasiewicz and Minca, 2005). It is not surprising, then, that following his re-election, George W. Bush and Condoleeza Rice embarked almost immediately on a “bridge-building” tour across Europe, noting not trans-Atlantic differences but “the great alliance of freedom” that unites the United States and Europe (Bush, 2005).  For although the United States may construct itself as the undisputed leader in the new global scenario, its “right” – and the right of its moral-political “mission” of spreading “freedom and justice” – relies on its amplification and support by allies. The construction of the United States&amp;#39; world role relies also on the selective placement and representation of other international actors who are “hailed” into specific subject positions (see Weldes, Laffey, Gusterson, and Duvall, 1999). Of course, different actors are granted different roles and different degrees of agency in the global script: the place of key European allies is different from that bestowed upon the peripheral and semi-peripheral states that make part of the “coalition of the willing”. Both, however, are vital in sustaining the representation of the US as the leader of a shared world of values and ideals. Indeed, the ‘lone superpower’ has little influence in the absence of support.  Another important dimension of integration as the key strategic concept is its dissolution of the inside/outside spatialization of security policy. The concluding lines of the “Strategy for Homeland Defense and Civil Support” are particularly telling. It contends that the Department of Defense can “no longer think in terms of the ‘home’ game and the ‘away’ game. There is only one game” (Department of Defense, 2005b: 40). In part this is directed at the previous failure to anticipate an attack from within: indeed, the Strategy remarks that the September 11th 2001 attacks “originated in US airspace and highlighted weaknesses in domestic radar coverage and interagency air defense coordination” (2005b: 22). In other words, the US needs to ensure the security of its homeland from within as much as without, to treat home as away. In part, however, such rhetoric also reflects a continuity with and reiteration of broader understandings with a much longer history, promoted by a range of US “intellectuals of statecraft” since the end of the Cold War: understandings that specified increasingly hard territorialisations of security and identity both at home and abroad to counter the “geopolitical vertigo” (see Ó Tuathail, 1996) of the post-bipolar era.  It is important to note here, moreover, that the 2002 National Security Strategy&amp;#39;s affirmation that “today, the distinction between domestic and foreign affairs is diminishing” (The White House, 2002b: 30) also involves the US treating away as a home, or at least, as a concern. From this we can see how the pursuit of integration enables the territorial integrity of other sovereign states to be violated in its name, as specific places are targeted to either ensure or overcome their exclusion (see Elden, 2005). As an example, consider this statement, which recalls the late 1970s enunciation of an ‘arc of crisis’ stretching from the Horn of Africa through the Middle East to Afghanistan: “There exists an ‘arc of instability’ stretching from the Western Hemisphere, through Africa and the Middle East and extending to Asia. There are areas in this arc that serve as breeding grounds for threats to our interests. Within these areas rogue states provide sanctuary to terrorists, protecting them from surveillance and attack” (Joint Chiefs of Staff, 2004: 5).  In his foreword to the 2002 National Security Strategy, Bush declared that “We will defend the peace by fighting terrorists and tyrants. We will preserve the peace by building good relations among the great powers. We will extend the peace by encouraging free and open societies on every continent” (Bush, 2002b: i). This notion of extension is crucial in understanding the explicitly spatial overtones of this strategy of integration: more than merely about values, democracy and capitalism, it is about a performative geopolitics. Put crudely, it is about specifying the geographies of world politics; it is about specifying “the ways the world (now) is” – a presumably descriptive “geopolitical exercise” but that, as all such exercises, also implicitly contains the prescription for putting the world “right”. Imaginative geographies and popular geopolitics  As we have tried to argue, such elaborations of security rely upon the affirmation of certain understandings of the world within the context of which the strategies and understandings advanced by them are rendered believable. What is more, we have tried to highlight how such performances invoke earlier articulations, even as their reiteration changes them. More broadly, we stressed how such articulations provide the conditions of possibility for current – and future – action. Integration thus marks a new performative articulation in US security strategy, but it reworks rather than replaces earlier formulations. One of the ways in which this operates is that the ideal of integration, as we have seen, necessarily invokes the idea of exclusion. The imagined divide between the US ‘homeland’ and the threatening ‘frontier’ lands within the circle of Barnett&amp;#39;s ‘Non-Integrating Gap’ thus recalls earlier iterations of ‘barbarism’ even if their identity and spatiality are produced by more than a simple self/other binary. In the final section of this essay, we will make some brief remarks regarding the disjuncture between the theory and the practice of the enactment of such imaginations. First, however, we would like to highlight some other ways in which these deployments of categories of inclusion and incorporation, on the one hand, and exclusion and targeting, on the other, are also performed in the popular geopolitical work done by a wide range of textual, visual, filmic and electronic media supportive of the ‘war on terror’ at home and abroad. These cultural practices resonate with the idea of fundamentally terrorist territories, whilst, at the same time rendering the ‘homeland’ zone of the continental US as a homogenous and virtuous ‘domestic’ community. Such wide-ranging and diffuse practices that are nonetheless imbricated with each other are further indications that we are dealing with performativity rather than construction in the production of imaginative geographies.

Securitization and its Mediation Ensures Total War and Genocide – Their Representations of [advantage/impacts] Ensure Astonishing Violence.
Karsten Friis, UN Sector @ the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs, 2k [Peace and Conflict Studies 7.2, “From Liminars to Others: Securitization Through Myths,” http://shss.nova.edu/pcs/journalsPDF/V7N2.pdf#page=2]

The problem with societal securitization is one of representation. It is rarely clear in advance who it is that speaks for a community. There is no system of representation as in a state. Since literately anyone can stand up as representatives, there is room for entrepreneurs. It is not surprising if we experience a struggle between different representatives and also their different representations of the society. What they do share, however, is a conviction that they are best at providing (a new) order. If they can do this convincingly, they gain legitimacy. What must be done is to make the uncertain certain and make the unknown an object of knowledge. To present a discernable Other is a way of doing this. The Other is represented as an Other ~-~- as an unified single actor with a similar unquestionable set of core values (i.e. the capital “O”). They are objectified, made into an object of knowledge, by re-presentation of their identity and values. In other words, the representation of the Other is depoliticized in the sense that its inner qualities are treated as given and non-negotiable. In Jef Huysmans (1998:241) words, there is both a need for a mediation of chaos as well as of threat. A mediation of chaos is more basic than a mediation of threat, as it implies making chaos into a meaningful order by a convincing representation of the Self and its surroundings. It is a mediation of “ontological security”, which means “...a strategy of managing the limits of reflexivity ... by fixing social relations into a symbolic and institutional order” (Huysmans 1998:242). As he and others (like Hansen 1998:240) have pointed out, the importance of a threat construction for political identification, is often overstated. The mediation of chaos, of being the provider of order in general, is just as important. This may imply naming an Other but not necessarily as a threat. Such a dichotomization implies a necessity to get rid of all the liminars (what Huysmans calls “strangers”). This is because they “...connote a challenge to categorizing practices through the impossibility of being categorized”, and does not threaten the community, “...but the possibility of ordering itself” (Huysmans 1998:241). They are a challenge to the entrepreneur by their very existence. They confuse the dichotomy of Self and Other and thereby the entrepreneur’s mediation of chaos. As mentioned, a liminar can for instance be people of mixed ethnical ancestry but also representations of competing world-pictures. As Eide (1998:76) notes: “Over and over again we see that the “liberals” within a group undergoing a mobilisation process for group conflict are the first ones to go”. The liminars threaten the ontological order of the entrepreneur by challenging his representation of Self and Other and his mediation of chaos, which ultimately undermines the legitimacy of his policy. The liminars may be securitized by some sort of disciplination, from suppression of cultural symbols to ethnic cleansing and expatriation. This is a threat to the ontological order of the entrepreneur, stemming from inside and thus repoliticizing the inside/outside dichotomy. Therefore the liminar must disappear. It must be made into a Self, as several minority groups throughout the world have experienced, or it must be forced out of the territory. A liminar may also become an Other, as its connection to the Self is cut and their former common culture is renounced and made insignificant. In Anne Norton’s (1988:55) words, “The presence of difference in the ambiguous other leads to its classification as wholly unlike and identifies it unqualifiedly with the archetypal other, denying the resemblance to the self.” Then the liminar is no longer an ontological danger (chaos), but what Huysmans (1998:242) calls a mediation of “daily security”. This is not challenging the order or the system as such but has become a visible, clear-cut Other. In places like Bosnia, this naming and replacement of an Other, has been regarded by the securitizing actors as the solution to the ontological problem they have posed. Securitization was not considered a political move, in the sense that there were any choices. It was a necessity: Securitization was a solution based on a depoliticized ontology.10 This way the world-picture of the securitizing actor is not only a representation but also made into reality. The mythical second-order language is made into first-order language, and its “innocent” reality is forced upon the world. To the entrepreneurs and other actors involved it has become a “natural” necessity with a need to make order, even if it implies making the world match the map. Maybe that is why war against liminars are so often total; it attempts a total expatriation or a total “solution” (like the Holocaust) and not only a victory on the battlefield. If the enemy is not even considered a legitimate Other, the door may be more open to a kind of violence that is way beyond any war conventions, any jus in bello. This way, securitizing is legitimized: The entrepreneur has succeeded both in launching his world-view and in prescribing the necessary measures taken against it. This is possible by using the myths, by speaking on behalf of the natural and eternal, where truth is never questioned. 

Alternative – Reject The Affirmative’s Security Logic – This Allows for Actual Political Thought – Accepting Their Descriptions and Responses Colonizes the Debate.
Mark Neocleous, Prof. of Government @ Brunel, 2008 [Critique of Security, 185-6]
The only way out of such a dilemma, to escape the fetish, is perhaps to eschew the logic of security altogether - to reject it as so ideologically loaded in favour of the state that any real political thought other than the authoritarian and reactionary should be pressed to give it up. That is clearly something that can not be achieved within the limits of bourgeois thought and thus could never even begin to be imagined by the security intellectual. It is also something that the constant iteration of the refrain &amp;#39;this is an insecure world&amp;#39; and reiteration of one fear, anxiety and insecurity after another will also make it hard to do. But it is something that the critique of security suggests we may have to consider if we want a political way out of the impasse of security.  This impasse exists because security has now become so all-encompassing that it marginalises all else, most notably the constructive conflicts, debates and discussions that animate political life. The constant prioritising of a mythical security as a political end - as the political end constitutes a rejection of politics in any meaningful sense of the term. That is, as a mode of action in which differences can be articulated, in which the conflicts and struggles that arise from such differences can be fought for and negotiated, in which people might come to believe that another world is possible - that they might transform the world and in turn be transformed. Security politics simply removes this; worse, it remoeves it while purportedly addressing it. In so doing it suppresses all issues of power and turns political questions into debates about the most efficient way to achieve &amp;#39;security&amp;#39;, despite the fact that we are never quite told - never could be told - what might count as having achieved it. Security politics is, in this sense, an anti-politics,&amp;#34;&amp;#39; dominating political discourse in much the same manner as the security state tries to dominate human beings, reinforcing security fetishism and the monopolistic character of security on the political imagination. We therefore need to get beyond security politics, not add yet more &amp;#39;sectors&amp;#39; to it in a way that simply expands the scope of the state and legitimises state intervention in yet more and more areas of our lives.  Simon Dalby reports a personal communication with Michael Williams, co-editor of the important text Critical Security Studies, in which the latter asks: if you take away security, what do you put in the hole that&amp;#39;s left behind? But I&amp;#39;m inclined to agree with Dalby: maybe there is no hole.&amp;#34;&amp;#39; The mistake has been to think that there is a hole and that this hole needs to be filled with a new vision or revision of security in which it is re-mapped or civilised or gendered or humanised or expanded or whatever. All of these ultimately remain within the statist political imaginary, and consequently end up reaffirming the state as the terrain of modern politics, the grounds of security. The real task is not to fill the supposed hole with yet another vision of security, but to fight for an alternative political language which takes us beyond the narrow horizon of bourgeois security and which therefore does not constantly throw us into the arms of the state. That&amp;#39;s the point of critical politics: to develop a new political language more adequate to the kind of society we want. Thus while much of what I have said here has been of a negative order, part of the tradition of critical theory is that the negative may be as significant as the positive in setting thought on new paths.  For if security really is the supreme concept of bourgeois society and the fundamental thematic of liberalism, then to keep harping on about insecurity and to keep demanding &amp;#39;more security&amp;#39; (while meekly hoping that this increased security doesn&amp;#39;t damage our liberty) is to blind ourselves to the possibility of building real alternatives to the authoritarian tendencies in contemporary politics. To situate ourselves against security politics would allow us to circumvent the debilitating effect achieved through the constant securitising of social and political issues, debilitating in the sense that &amp;#39;security&amp;#39; helps consolidate the power of the existing forms of social domination and justifies the short-circuiting of even the most democratic forms. It would also allow us to forge another kind of politics centred on a different conception of the good. We need a new way of thinking and talking about social being and politics that moves us beyond security. This would perhaps be emancipatory in the true sense of the word. What this might mean, precisely, must be open to debate. But it certainly requires recognising that security is an illusion that has forgotten it is an illusion; it requires recognising that security is not the same as solidarity; it requires accepting that insecurity is part of the human condition, and thus giving up the search for the certainty of security and instead learning to tolerate the uncertainties, ambiguities and &amp;#39;insecurities&amp;#39; that come with being human; it requires accepting that &amp;#39;securitizing&amp;#39; an issue does not mean dealing with it politically, but bracketing it out and handing it to the state; it requires us to be brave enough to return the gift.&amp;#34;&amp;#39;

OF THE CHALLENGES that American democracy faces today, none is more formidable than the problem of moral disagreement. Neither the theory nor the practice of democratic politics has so far found an adequate way to cope with conflicts about fundamental values. We address the challenge of moral disagreement here by developing a conception of democracy that secures a central place for moral discussion in political life.
Along with a growing number of other political theorists, we call this conception deliberative democracy. The core idea is simple: when citizens or their representatives disagree morally, they should continue to reason together to reach mutually acceptable decisions. But the meaning and implications of the idea are complex. Although the idea has a long history, it is still in search of a theory. We do not claim that this book provides a comprehensive theory of deliberative democracy, but we do hope that it contributes toward its future development by showing the kind of delib-eration that is possible and desirable in the face of moral disagreement in democracies.
Some scholars have criticized liberal political theory for neglecting moral deliberation. Others have analyzed the philosophical foundations of deliberative democracy, and still others have begun to explore institutional reforms that would promote deliberation. Yet nearly all of them stop at the point where deliberation itself begins. None has systematically examined the substance of deliberation—the theoretical principles that should guide moral argument and their implications for actual moral disagreements about public policy. That is our subject, and it takes us into the everyday forums of democratic politics, where moral argument regularly appears but where theoretical analysis too rarely goes.
Deliberative democracy involves reasoning about politics, and nothing has been more controversial in political philosophy than the nature of reason in politics. We do not believe that these controversies have to be settled before deliberative principles can guide the practice of democracy. Since on occasion citizens and their representatives already engage in the kind of reasoning that those principles recommend, deliberative democracy simply asks that they do so more consistently and comprehensively. The best way to prove the value of this kind of reasoning is to show its role in arguments about specific principles and policies, and its contribu¬tion to actual political debates. That is also ultimately the best justification for our conception of deliberative democracy itself. But to forestall pos¬sible misunderstandings of our conception of deliberative democracy, we offer some preliminary remarks about the scope and method of this book.
The aim of the moral reasoning that our deliberative democracy pre-scribes falls between impartiality, which requires something like altruism, and prudence, which demands no more than enlightened self-interest. Its first principle is reciprocity, the subject of Chapter 2, but no less essential are the other principles developed in later chapters. When citizens reason reciprocally, they seek fair terms of social cooperation for their own sake; they try to find mutually acceptable ways of resolving moral disagreements.
The precise content of reciprocity is difficult to determine in theory, but its general countenance is familiar enough in practice. It can be seen in the difference between acting in one&amp;#39;s self-interest (say, taking advantage of a legal loophole or a lucky break) and acting fairly (following rules in the spirit that one expects others to adopt). In many of the controversies dis-cussed later in the book, the possibility of any morally acceptable resolution depends on citizens&amp;#39; reasoning beyond their narrow self-interest and considering what can be justified to people who reasonably disagree with them. Even though the quality of deliberation and the conditions under which it is conducted are far from ideal in the controversies we consider, the fact that in each case some citizens and some officials make arguments consistent with reciprocity suggests that a deliberative perspective is not Utopian.
To clarify what reciprocity might demand under non-ideal conditions, we develop a distinction between deliberative and nondeliberative disa-greement. Citizens who reason reciprocally can recognize that a position is worthy of moral respect even when they think it morally wrong. They can believe that a moderate pro-life position on abortion, for example, is morally respectable even though they think it morally mistaken. (The abortion example—to which we often return in the book—is meant to be illustrative. For readers who deny that there is any room for deliberative disagreement on abortion, other political controversies can make the same point.) The presence of deliberative disagreement has important implications for how citizens treat one another and for what policies they should adopt. When a disagreement is not deliberative (for example, about a policy to legalize discrimination against blacks and women), citizens do not have any obligations of mutual respect toward their opponents. In deliberative disagreement (for example, about legalizing abortion), citizens should try to accommodate the moral convictions of their opponents to the greatest extent possible, without compromising their own moral convictions. We call this kind of accommodation an economy of moral disagreement, and believe that, though neglected in theory and practice, it is essential to a morally robust democratic life.
Although both of us have devoted some of our professional life to urging these ideas on public officials and our fellow citizens in forums of practical politics, this book is primarily the product of scholarly rather than political deliberation. Insofar as it reaches beyond the academic community, it is addressed to citizens and officials in their more reflective frame of mind. Given its academic origins, some readers may be inclined to complain that only professors could be so unrealistic as to believe that moral reasoning can help solve political problems. But such a complaint would misrepresent our aims.
To begin with, we do not think that academic discussion (whether in scholarly journals or college classrooms) is a model for moral deliberation in politics. Academic discussion need not aim at justifying a practical decision, as deliberation must. Partly for this reason, academic discussion is likely to be insensitive to the contexts of ordinary politics: the pressures of power, the problems of inequality, the demands of diversity, the exigencies of persuasion. Some critics of deliberative democracy show a similar insensitivity when they judge actual political deliberations by the standards of ideal philosophical reflection. Actual deliberation is inevitably defective, but so is philosophical reflection practiced in politics. The appropriate comparison is between the ideals of democratic deliberation and philosophical reflection, or between the application of each in the non-ideal circumstances of politics.
We do not assume that politics should be a realm where the logical syllogism rules. Nor do we expect even the more appropriate standard of mutual respect always to prevail in politics. A deliberative perspective sometimes justifies bargaining, negotiation, force, and even violence. It is partly because moral argument has so much unrealized potential in dem-ocratic politics that we believe it deserves more attention. Because its place in politics is so precarious, the need to find it a more secure home and to nourish its development is all the more pressing. Yet because it is also already part of our common experience, we have reason to hope that it can survive and even prosper if philosophers along with citizens and public officials better appreciate its value in politics.
Some readers may still wonder why deliberation should have such a prominent place in democracy. Surely, they may say, citizens should care more about the justice of public policies than the process by which they are adopted, at least so long as the process is basically fair and at least minimally democratic. One of our main aims in this book is to cast doubt on the dichotomy between policies and process that this concern assumes. Having good reason as individuals to believe that a policy is just does not mean that collectively as citizens we have sufficient justification to legislate on the basis of those reasons. The moral authority of collective judgments about policy depends in part on the moral quality of the process by which citizens collectively reach those judgments. Deliberation is the most appropriate way for citizens collectively to resolve their moral disagreements not only about policies but also about the process by which policies should be adopted. Deliberation is not only a means to an end, but also a means for deciding what means are morally required to pursue our common ends.

Effective deliberation is crucial to personal agency and is only possible in a switch-side debate format where debaters divorce themselves from ideology~-~--this is vital to preventing mass violence and genocide
Patricia Roberts-Miller 3 is Associate Professor of Rhetoric at the University of Texas &amp;#34;Fighting Without Hatred:Hannah Ar endt &amp;#39; s Agonistic Rhetoric&amp;#34; JAC 22.2 2003
Totalitarianism and the Competitive Space of Agonism
Arendt is probably most famous for her analysis of totalitarianism (especially her The Origins of Totalitarianism andEichmann in Jerusa¬lem), but the recent attention has been on her criticism of mass culture (The Human Condition). Arendt&amp;#39;s main criticism of the current human condition is that the common world of deliberate and joint action is fragmented into solipsistic and unreflective behavior. In an especially lovely passage, she says that in mass society people are all imprisoned in the subjectivity of their own singular experience, which does not cease to be singular if the same experience is multiplied innumerable times. The end of the common world has come when it is seen only under one aspect and is permitted to present itself in only one perspective. (Human 58)
What Arendt so beautifully describes is that isolation and individualism are not corollaries, and may even be antithetical because obsession with one&amp;#39;s own self and the particularities of one&amp;#39;s life prevents one from engaging in conscious, deliberate, collective action. Individuality, unlike isolation, depends upon a collective with whom one argues in order to direct the common life. Self-obsession, even (especially?) when coupled with isolation from one&amp;#39; s community is far from apolitical; it has political consequences. Perhaps a better way to put it is that it is political precisely because it aspires to be apolitical. This fragmented world in which many people live simultaneously and even similarly but not exactly together is what Arendt calls the &amp;#34;social.&amp;#34;
Arendt does not mean that group behavior is impossible in the realm of the social, but that social behavior consists &amp;#34;in some way of isolated individuals, incapable of solidarity or mutuality, who abdicate their human capacities and responsibilities to a projected &amp;#39;they&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;it,&amp;#39; with disastrous consequences, both for other people and eventually for themselves&amp;#34; (Pitkin 79). One can behave, butnot act. For someone like Arendt, a German-assimilated Jew, one of the most frightening aspects of the Holocaust was the ease with which a people who had not been extraordinarily anti-Semitic could be put to work industriously and efficiently on the genocide of the Jews. And what was striking about the perpetrators of the genocide, ranging from minor functionaries who facilitated the murder transports up to major figures on trial at Nuremberg, was their constant and apparently sincere insistence that they were not responsible. For Arendt, this was not a peculiarity of the German people, but of the current human and heavily bureaucratic condition of twentieth-century culture: we do not consciously choose to engage in life&amp;#39;s activities; we drift into them, or we do them out of a desire to conform. Even while we do them, we do not acknowledge an active, willed choice to do them; instead, we attribute our behavior to necessity, and we perceive ourselves as determined—determined by circumstance, by accident, by what &amp;#34;they&amp;#34; tell us to do. We do something from within the anonymity of a mob that we would never do as an individual; we do things for which we will not take responsibility. Yet, whether or not people acknowledge responsibil¬ity for the consequences of their actions, those consequences exist. Refusing to accept responsibility can even make those consequences worse, in that the people who enact the actions in question, because they do not admit their own agency, cannot be persuaded to stop those actions. They are simply doing their jobs. In a totalitarian system, however, everyone is simply doing his or her job; there never seems to be anyone who can explain, defend, and change the policies. Thus, it is, as Arendt says, rule by nobody.
It is illustrative to contrast Arendt&amp;#39;s attitude toward discourse to Habermas&amp;#39;. While both are critical of modern bureaucratic and totalitar¬ian systems, Arendt&amp;#39;s solution is the playful and competitive space of agonism; it is not the rational-critical public sphere. The &amp;#34;actual content of political life&amp;#34; is &amp;#34;the joy and the gratification that arise out of being in company with our peers, out of acting together and appearing in public, out of inserting ourselves into the world by word and deed, thus acquiring and sustaining our personal identity and beginning something entirely new&amp;#34; (&amp;#34;Truth&amp;#34; 263). According to Seyla Benhabib, Arendt&amp;#39;s public realm emphasizes the assumption of competition, and it &amp;#34;represents that space of appearances in which moral and political greatness, heroism, and preeminence are revealed, displayed, shared with others. This is a competitive space in which one competes for recognition, precedence, and acclaim&amp;#34; (78). These qualities are displayed, but not entirely for purposes of acclamation; they are not displays of one&amp;#39;s self, but of ideas and arguments, of one&amp;#39;s thought. When Arendt discusses Socrates&amp;#39; thinking in public, she emphasizes his performance: &amp;#34;He performed in the marketplace the way the flute-player performed at a banquet. It is sheer performance, sheer activity&amp;#34;; nevertheless, it was thinking: &amp;#34;What he actually did was to make public, in discourse, the thinking process&amp;#34; &amp;#123;Lectures 37). Pitkin summarizes this point: &amp;#34;Arendt says that the heroism associated with politics is not the mythical machismo of ancient Greece but something more like the existential leap into action and public exposure&amp;#34; (175-76). Just as it is not machismo, although it does have considerable ego involved, so it is not instrumental rationality; Arendt&amp;#39;s discussion of the kinds of discourse involved in public action include myths, stories, and personal narratives.
Furthermore, the competition is not ruthless; it does not imply a willingness to triumph at all costs. Instead, it involves something like having such a passion for ideas and politics that one is willing to take risks. One tries to articulate the best argument, propose the best policy, design the best laws, make the best response. This is a risk in that one might lose; advancing an argument means that one must be open to the criticisms others will make of it. The situation is agonistic not because the participants manufacture or seek conflict, but because conflict is a necessary consequence of difference. This attitude is reminiscent of Kenneth Burke, who did not try to find a language free of domination but who instead theorized a way that the very tendency toward hierarchy in language might be used against itself (for more on this argument, see Kastely). Similarly, Arendt does not propose a public realm of neutral, rational beings who escape differences to live in the discourse of universals; she envisions one of different people who argue with passion, vehemence, and integrity.

Eichmann perfectly exemplified what Arendt famously called the &amp;#34;banal¬ity of evil&amp;#34; but that might be better thought of as the bureaucratization of evil (or, as a friend once aptly put it, the evil of banality). That is, he was able to engage in mass murder because he was able not to think about it, especially not from the perspective of the victims, and he was able to exempt himself from personal responsibility by telling himself (and anyone else who would listen) that he was just following orders. It was the bureaucratic system that enabled him to do both. He was not exactly passive; he was, on the contrary, very aggressive in trying to do his duty. He behaved with the &amp;#34;ruthless, competitive exploitation&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;inauthen-tic, self-disparaging conformism&amp;#34; that characterizes those who people totalitarian systems (Pitkin 87).
Arendt&amp;#39;s theorizing of totalitarianism has been justly noted as one of her strongest contributions to philosophy. She saw that a situation like Nazi Germany is different from the conventional understanding of a tyranny. Pitkin writes,
Totalitarianism cannot be understood, like earlier forms of domination, as the ruthless exploitation of some people by others, whether the motive be selfish calculation, irrational passion, or devotion to some cause. Understanding totalitarianism&amp;#39;s essential nature requires solving the central mystery of the holocaust—the objectively useless and indeed dysfunctional, fanatical pursuit of a purely ideological policy, a pointless process to which the people enacting it have fallen captive. (87)
Totalitarianism is closely connected to bureaucracy; it is oppression by rules, rather than by people who have willfully chosen to establish certain rules. It is the triumph of the social.
Critics (both friendly and hostile) have paid considerable attention to Arendt&amp;#39;s category of the &amp;#34;social,&amp;#34; largely because, despite spending so much time on the notion, Arendt remains vague on certain aspects of it. Pitkin appropriately compares Arendt&amp;#39;s concept of the social to the Blob, the type of monster that figured in so many post-war horror movies. That Blob was &amp;#34;an evil monster from outer space, entirely external to and separate from us [that] had fallen upon us intent on debilitating, absorb¬ing, and ultimately destroying us, gobbling up our distinct individuality and turning us into robots that mechanically serve its purposes&amp;#34; (4).
Pitkin is critical of this version of the &amp;#34;social&amp;#34; and suggests that Arendt meant (or perhaps should have meant) something much more complicated. The simplistic version of the social-as-Blob can itself be an instance of Blob thinking; Pitkin&amp;#39;s criticism is that Arendt talks at times as though the social comes from outside of us and has fallen upon us, turning us into robots. Yet, Arendt&amp;#39;s major criticism of the social is that it involves seeing ourselves as victimized by something that comes from outside our own behavior. I agree with Pitkin that Arendt&amp;#39;s most powerful descriptions of the social (and the other concepts similar to it, such as her discussion of totalitarianism, imperialism, Eichmann, and parvenus) emphasize that these processes are not entirely out of our control but that they happen to us when, and because, we keep refusing to make active choices. We create the social through negligence. It is not the sort of force in a Sorcerer&amp;#39;s Apprentice, which once let loose cannot be stopped; on the contrary, it continues to exist because we structure our world to reward social behavior. Pitkin writes, &amp;#34;From childhood on, in virtually all our institutions, we reward euphemism, salesmanship, slo¬gans, and we punish and suppress truth-telling, originality, thoughtful-ness. So we continually cultivate ways of (not) thinking that induce the social&amp;#34; (274). I want to emphasize this point, as it is important for thinking about criticisms of some forms of the social construction of knowledge: denying our own agency is what enables the social to thrive. To put it another way, theories of powerlessness are self-fulfilling prophecies.
Arendt grants that there are people who willed the Holocaust, but she insists that totalitarian systems result not so much from the Hitlers or Stalins as from the bureaucrats who may or may not agree with the established ideology but who enforce the rules for no stronger motive than a desire to avoid trouble with their superiors (see Eichmann and Life). They do not think about what they do. One might prevent such occurrences—or, at least, resist the modern tendency toward totalitarian¬ism—by thought: &amp;#34;critical thought is in principle anti-authoritarian&amp;#34; (Lectures 38).
By &amp;#34;thought&amp;#34; Arendt does not mean eremitic contemplation; in fact, she has great contempt for what she calls &amp;#34;professional thinkers,&amp;#34; refusing herself to become a philosopher or to call her work philosophy. Young-Bruehl, Benhabib, and Pitkin have each said that Heidegger represented just such a professional thinker for Arendt, and his embrace of Nazism epitomized the genuine dangers such &amp;#34;thinking&amp;#34; can pose (see Arendt&amp;#39;s &amp;#34;Heidegger&amp;#34;). &amp;#34;Thinking&amp;#34; is not typified by the isolated con¬templation of philosophers; it requires the arguments of others and close attention to the truth. It is easy to overstate either part of that harmony. One must consider carefully the arguments and viewpoints of others:
Political thought is representative. I form an opinion by considering a given issue from different viewpoints, by making present to my mind the standpoints of those who are absent; that is, I represent them. This process of representation does not blindly adopt the actual views of those who stand somewhere else, and hence look upon the world from a different perspective; this is a question neither of empathy, as though I tried to be or to feel like somebody else, nor of counting noses and joining a majority but of being and thinking in my own identity where actually I am not. The more people&amp;#39;s standpoints I have present in my mind while I am ponder¬ing a given issue, and the better I can imagine how I would feel and think if I were in their place, the stronger will be my capacity for represen¬tative thinking and the more valid my final conclusions, my opinion. (&amp;#34;Truth&amp;#34; 241)
There are two points to emphasize in this wonderful passage. First, one does not get these standpoints in one&amp;#39;s mind through imagining them, but through listening to them; thus, good thinking requires that one hear the arguments of other people. Hence, as Arendt says, &amp;#34;critical thinking, while still a solitary business, does not cut itself off from&amp;#39; all others.&amp;#39;&amp;#34; Thinking is, in this view, necessarily public discourse: critical thinking is possible &amp;#34;only where the standpoints of all others are open to inspection&amp;#34; (Lectures 43). Yet, it is not a discourse in which one simply announces one&amp;#39;s stance; participants are interlocutors and not just speakers; they must listen. Unlike many current versions of public discourse, this view presumes that speech matters. It is not asymmetric manipulation of others, nor merely an economic exchange; it must be a world into which one enters and by which one might be changed.
Second, passages like the above make some readers think that Arendt puts too much faith in discourse and too little in truth (see Habermas). But Arendt is no crude relativist; she believes in truth, and she believes that there are facts that can be more or less distorted. She does not believe that reality is constructed by discourse, or that truth is indistinguishable from falsehood. She insists tha^ the truth has a different pull on us and, consequently, that it has a difficult place in the world of the political. Facts are different from falsehood because, while they can be distorted or denied, especially when they are inconvenient for the powerful, they also have a certain positive force that falsehood lacks: &amp;#34;Truth, though powerless and always defe ated in a head-on clash with the powers that be, possesses a strength of its own: whatever those in power may contrive, they are unable to discover or invent a viable substitute for it. Persuasion and violence can destroy truth, but they cannot replace it&amp;#34; (&amp;#34;Truth&amp;#34; 259).
Facts have a strangely resilient quality partially because a lie &amp;#34;tears, as it were, a hole in the fabric of factuality. As every historian knows, one can spot a lie by noticing incongruities, holes, or the j unctures of patched-up places&amp;#34; (&amp;#34;Truth&amp;#34; 253). While she is sometimes discouraging about our ability to see the tears in the fabric, citing the capacity of totalitarian governments to create the whole cloth (see &amp;#34;Truth&amp;#34; 252-54), she is also sometimes optimistic. InEichmann in Jerusalem, she repeats the story of Anton Schmidt—a man who saved the lives of Jews—and concludes that such stories cannot be silenced (230-32). For facts to exert power in the common world, however, these stories must be told. Rational truth (such as principles of mathematics) might be perceptible and demonstrable through individual contemplation, but &amp;#34;factual truth, on the contrary, is always related to other people: it concerns events and circumstances in which many are involved; it is established by witnesses and depends upon testimony; it exists only to the extent that it is spoken about, even if it occurs in the domain of privacy. It is political by nature&amp;#34; (23 8). Arendt is neither a positivist who posits an autonomous individual who can correctly perceive truth, nor a relativist who positively asserts the inherent relativism of all perception. Her description of how truth functions does not fall anywhere in the three-part expeditio so prevalent in bothrhetoric and philosophy: it is not expressivist, positivist, or social constructivist. Good thinking depends upon good public argument, and good public argument depends upon access to facts: &amp;#34;Freedom of opinion is a farce unless factual information is guaranteed&amp;#34; (238).
The sort of thinking that Arendt propounds takes the form of action only when it is public argument, and, as such, it is particularly precious: &amp;#34;For if no other test but the experience of being active, no other measure but the extent of sheer activity were to be applied to the various activities within the vita activa, it might well be that thinking as such would surpass them all&amp;#34; (Human 325). Arendt insists that it is &amp;#34;the same general rule— Do not contradict yourself (not your self but your thinking ego)—that determines both thinking and acting&amp;#34; (Lectures 3 7). In place of the mildly resentful conformism that fuels totalitarianism, Arendt proposes what Pitkin calls &amp;#34;a tough-minded, open-eyed readiness to perceive and judge reality for oneself, in terms of concrete experience and independent, critical theorizing&amp;#34; (274). The paradoxical nature of agonism (that it must involve both individuality and commonality) makes it difficult to maintain, as the temptation is great either to think one&amp;#39;s own thoughts without reference to anyone else or to let others do one&amp;#39;s thinking.
Arendt&amp;#39;s Polemical Agonism
As I said, agonism does have its advocates within rhetoric—Burke, Ong, Sloane, Gage, and Jarratt, for instance—but while each of these theorists proposes a form of conflictual argument, not one of these is as adversarial as Arendt&amp;#39;s. Agonism can emphasize persuasion, as does John Gage&amp;#39;s textbook The Shape of Reason or William Brandt et al.&amp;#39;s The Craft of Writing. That is, the goal of the argument is to identify the disagreement and then construct a text that gains the assent of the audience. This is not the same as what Gage (citing Thomas Conley) calls &amp;#34;asymmetrical theories of rhetoric&amp;#34;: theories that &amp;#34;presuppose an active speaker and a passive audience, a speaker whose rhetorical task is therefore to do something to that audience&amp;#34; (&amp;#34;Reasoned&amp;#34; 6). Asymmetric rhetoric is not and cannot be agonistic. Persuasive agonism still values conflict, disagreement, and equality among interlocutors, but it has the goal of reaching agreement, as when Gage says that the process of argument should enable one&amp;#39;s reasons to be &amp;#34;understood and believed&amp;#34; by others (Shape 5; emphasis added).
Arendt&amp;#39;s version is what one might call polemical agonism: it puts less emphasis on gaining assent, and it is exemplified both in Arendt&amp;#39;s own writing and in Donald Lazere&amp;#39;s &amp;#34;Ground Rules for Polemicists&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Teaching the Political Conflicts.&amp;#34; Both forms of agonism (persuasive and polemical) require substantive debate at two points in a long and recursive process. First, one engages in debate in order to invent one&amp;#39;s argument; even silent thinking is a &amp;#34;dialogue of myself with myself (Lectures 40). The difference between the two approaches to agonism is clearest when one presents an argument to an audience assumed to be an opposition. In persuasive agonism, one plays down conflict and moves through reasons to try to persuade one&amp;#39;s audience. In polemical agonism, however, one&amp;#39;s intention is not necessarily to prove one&amp;#39;s case, but to make public one&amp;#39; s thought in order to test it. In this way, communicability serves the same function in philosophy that replicability serves in the sciences; it is how one tests the validity of one&amp;#39;s thought. In persuasive agonism, success is achieved through persuasion; in polemical agonism, success may be marked through the quality of subsequent controversy.
Arendt quotes from a letter Kant wrote on this point:
You know that I do not approach reasonable objections with the intention merely of refuting them, but that in thinking them over I always weave them into my judgments, and afford them the opportunity of overturning all my most cherished beliefs. I entertain the hope that by thus viewing my judgments impartially from the standpoint of others some third view that will improve upon my previous insight may be obtainable. &amp;#123;Lectures 42)
Kant&amp;#39;s use of &amp;#34;impartial&amp;#34; here is interesting: he is not describing a stance that is free of all perspective; it is impartial only in the sense that it is not his own view. This is the same way that Arendt uses the term; she does not advocate any kind of positivistic rationality, but instead a &amp;#34;universal interdependence&amp;#34; (&amp;#34;Truth&amp;#34; 242). She does not place the origin of the &amp;#34;disinterested pursuit of truth&amp;#34; in science, but at &amp;#34;the moment when Homer chose to sing the deeds of the Trojans no less than those of the Achaeans, and to praise the glory of Hector, the foe and the defeated man, no less than the glory of Achilles, the hero of his kinfolk&amp;#34; (&amp;#34;Truth&amp;#34; 262¬63). It is useful to note that Arendt tends not to use the term &amp;#34;universal,&amp;#34; opting more often for &amp;#34;common,&amp;#34; by which she means both what is shared and what is ordinary, a usage that evades many of the problems associated with universalism while preserving its virtues (for a brief butprovocative application of Arendt&amp;#39;s notion of common, see Hauser 100-03).
In polemical agonism, there is a sense in which one&amp;#39; s main goal is not to persuade one&amp;#39;s readers; persuading one&amp;#39;s readers, if this means that they fail to see errors and flaws in one&amp;#39; s argument, might actually be a sort of failure. It means that one wishes to put forward an argument that makes clear what one&amp;#39;s stance is and why one holds it, but with the intention of provoking critique and counterargument. Arendt describes Kant&amp;#39;s &amp;#34;hope&amp;#34; for his writings not that the number of people who agree with him would increase but &amp;#34;that the circle of his examiners would gradually be en¬larged&amp;#34; &amp;#123;Lectures 39); he wanted interlocutors, not acolytes.
This is not consensus-based argument, nor is it what is sometimes called &amp;#34;consociational argument,&amp;#34; nor is this argument as mediation or conflict resolution. Arendt (and her commentators) use the term &amp;#34;fight,&amp;#34; and they mean it. When Arendt describes the values that are necessary in our world, she says, &amp;#34;They are a sense of honor, desire for fame and glory, the spirit of fighting without hatred and &amp;#39;without the spirit of revenge,&amp;#39; and indifference to material advantages&amp;#34; &amp;#123;Crises 167). Pitkin summarizes Arendt&amp;#39;s argument: &amp;#34;Free citizenship presupposes the ability to fight— openly, seriously, with commitment, and about things that really mat¬ter—without fanaticism, without seeking to exterminate one&amp;#39;s oppo¬nents&amp;#34; (266). My point here is two-fold: first, there is not a simple binary opposition between persuasive discourse and eristic discourse, the conflictual versus the collaborative, or argument as opposed to debate.
Second, while polemical agonismrequires diversity among interlocutors, and thus seems an extraordinarily appropriate notion, and while it may be a useful corrective to too much emphasis on persuasion, it seems to me that polemical agonism could easily slide into the kind of wrangling that is simply frustrating. Arendt does not describe just how one is to keep the conflict useful. Although she rejects the notion that politics is &amp;#34;no more than a battlefield of partial, conflicting interests, where nothing countfs] but pleasure and profit, partisanship, and the lust for dominion,&amp;#34; she does not say exactly how we are to know when we are engaging in the existential leap of argument versus when we are lusting for dominion (&amp;#34;Truth&amp;#34; 263).
Like other proponents of agonism, Arendt argues that rhetoric does not lead individuals or communities to ultimate Truth; it leads to decisions that will necessarily have to be reconsidered. Even Arendt, who tends to express a greater faith than many agonists (such as Burke, Sloane, or Kastely) in the ability of individuals to perceive truth, insists that self-deception is always a danger, so public discourse is necessary as a form of testing (see especially Lectures and &amp;#34;Truth&amp;#34;). She remarks that it is difficult to think beyond one&amp;#39;s self-interest and that &amp;#34;nothing, indeed, is more common, even among highly sophisticated people, than the blind obstinacy that becomes manifest in lack of imagination and failure to judge&amp;#34; (&amp;#34;Truth&amp;#34; 242).
Agonism demands that one simultaneously trust and doubt one&amp;#39; s own perceptions, rely on one&amp;#39;s own judgment and consider the judgments of others, think for oneself and imagine how others think. The question remains whether this is a kind of thought in which everyone can engage. Is the agonistic public sphere (whether political, academic, or scientific) only available to the few? Benhabib puts this criticism in the form of a question: &amp;#34;That is, is the &amp;#39;recovery of the public space&amp;#39; under conditions of modernity necessarily an elitist and antidemocratic project that can hardly be reconciled with the demand for universal political emancipa¬tion and the universal extension of citizenship rights that have accompa¬nied modernity since the American and French Revolutions?&amp;#34; (75). This is an especially troubling question not only because Arendt&amp;#39;s examples of agonistic rhetoric are from elitist cultures, but also because of com¬ments she makes, such as this one from The Human Condition: &amp;#34;As a living experience, thought has always been assumed, perhaps wrongly, to be known only to the few. It may not be presumptuous to believe that these few have not become fewer in our time&amp;#34; &amp;#123;Human 324).
Yet, there are important positive political consequences of agonism.
Arendt&amp;#39; s own promotion of the agonistic sphere helps to explain how the system could be actively moral. It is not an overstatement to say that a central theme in Arendt&amp;#39;s work is the evil of conformity—the fact that the modern bureaucratic state makes possible extraordinary evil carried out by people who do not even have any ill will toward their victims. It does so by &amp;#34;imposing innumerable and various rules, all of which tend to &amp;#39;normalize&amp;#39; its members, to make them behave, to exclude spontaneous action or outstanding achievement&amp;#34; (Human 40). It keeps people from thinking, and it keeps them behaving. The agonistic model&amp;#39;s celebration of achievement and verbal skill undermines the political force of conformity, so it is a force against the bureaucratizing of evil. If people think for themselves, they will resist dogma; if people think of themselves as one of many, they will empathize; if people can do both, they will resist totalitarianism. And if they talk about what they see, tell their stories, argue about their perceptions, and listen to one another—that is, engage in rhetoric—then they are engaging in antitotalitarian action.
In post-Ramistic rhetoric, it is a convention to have a thesis, and one might well wonder just what mine is—whether I am arguing for or against Arendt&amp;#39;s agonism. Arendt does not lay out a pedagogy for us to follow (although one might argue that, if she had, it would lookmuch like the one Lazere describes in &amp;#34;Teaching&amp;#34;), so I am not claiming that greater attention to Arendt would untangle various pedagogical problems that teachers of writing face. Nor am I claiming that applying Arendt&amp;#39;s views will resolve theoretical arguments that occupy scholarly journals. I am saying, on the one hand, that Arendt&amp;#39;s connection of argument and thinking, as well as her perception that both serve to thwart totalitarian¬ism, suggest that agonal rhetoric (despite the current preference for collaborative rhetoric) is the best discourse for a diverse and inclusive public sphere. On the other hand, Arendt&amp;#39;s advocacy of agonal rhetoric is troubling (and, given her own admiration for Kant, this may be intentional), especially in regard to its potential elitism, masculinism, failure to describe just how to keep argument from collapsing into wrangling, and apparently cheerful acceptance of hierarchy. Even with these flaws, Arendt describes something we would do well to consider thoughtfully: a fact-based but not positivist, communally grounded but not relativist, adversarial but not violent, independent but not expressivist rhetoric.

Limited Debate

Democratic agonism can only successfully operate in a limited forum~-~--it’s not a limitation on the content of argument, but on the form in which it is presented~-~--this is not an appeal to exclusion, but to maximizing the deliberative potential of debate
Robert W. Glover 10 Prof of Poli Sci @ UConn &amp;#34;Games without Frontiers?: Democratic Engagement, Agonistic Pluralism, and the Question of Exclusion&amp;#34; Philosophy and Social Criticism Vol. 36
Recent democratic theory has devoted significant attention to the question of how to revitalize citizen engagement and reshape citizen involvement within the process of collective political decision-making and self-government. Yet these theorists do so with the sober recognition that more robust democratic engagement may provide new means for domination, exploitation- intensification of disagreement, or even the introduction of fanaticism into our public debates.1 Thus, numerous proposals have attempted to define the acceptable boundaries of our day-to-day democratic discourse and establish regulative ideals whereby we restrict the types of justifications that can be employed in democratic argumentation. This subtle form of exclusion delineates which forms of democratic discourse are deemed to be legitimate—worthy of consideration in the larger democratic community, and morally justifiable as a basis for policy. As an outgrowth of these concerns, this newfound emphasis on political legitimacy has provoked a flurry of scholarly analysis and debate.&amp;#34;
Different theorists promote divergent conceptions of what ought to count as acceptable and legitimate forms of democratic engagement, and promote more or less stringent normative conceptions of the grounds for exclusion and de-legitimization. One of the most novel approaches to this question is offered by agonistic pluralism, a strain of democratic theory advanced by political theorists such as William Connolly, Bonnie Honig, Ernesto Laclau, Chantal Mouffe, and James Tully. Agonistic pluralism, or simply agonism, is a theory of democracy rooted in the ancient Greek notion of the agon, a public struggle or contest between adversaries. While recognizing the necessity of placing restrictions upon democratic discourse, agonistic pluralists also call upon us to guard against the naturalization of such exclusion and the coercive act of power which it implies. Rather, we must treat these actions as contingent, subject to further scrutiny, critique, and re-articulation in contentious and widely inclusive democratic spaces.
In so doing, agonistic pluralism offers us a novel means of approaching democratic discourse, receptive to the claims of new actors and identities while also recognizing that there must be some, albeit minimal, restrictions placed on the form that such democratic engagement takes. In short, the goal of agonists is not to &amp;#39;eradicate the use of power in social relations but to acknowledge its ineradicable nature and attempt to modify power in ways that are compatible with democratic values&amp;#39;.5 This is democracy absent the &amp;#39;final guarantee* or the &amp;#39;definitive legitimation.&amp;#39;4 As one recent commentator succinctly put it, agonistic pluralism forces democratic actors to &amp;#39;...relinquish all claims to finality, to happy endings../.5
Yet while agonistic pluralism offers valuable insights regarding how we might reshape and revitalize the character of our democratic communities, it is a much more diverse intellectual project than is commonly acknowledged. There are no doubt continuities among these thinkers, yet those engaged in agonistic pluralism ultimately operate with divergent fundamental assumptions, see different processes at work in contemporary democratic politics, and aspire towards unique political end-goals. To the extent that we do not recognize these different variants, we risk failing to adequately consider proposals which could positively alter the character of our democratic engagement, enabling us to reframe contemporary pluralism as a positive avenue for social change and inclusion rather than a crisis to be contained.
This piece begins by outlining agonistic pluralism&amp;#39;s place within the larger theoretical project of revitalizing democratic practice, centered on the theme of what constitutes &amp;#39;legitimate&amp;#34; democratic discourse. Specifically, I focus on agonism&amp;#39;s place in relation to &amp;#39;participatory&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;deliberative&amp;#39; strains of democratic theory. I then highlight the under-examined diversity of those theorists commonly captured under the heading of agonistic pluralism, drawing upon Chantal Mouffe*s recent distinction between &amp;#39;dissociative&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;associative&amp;#39; agonism. However, I depart from her assertion that &amp;#39;associative agonists&amp;#39; such as Bonnie Honig and William Connolly offer us no means by which to engage in the &amp;#39;negative determination of frontiers* of our political spaces. Contra Mouffe, I defend these theorists as offering the most valuable formulation of agonism, due to their articulation of the civic virtues and democratic (re)education needed to foster greater inclusivity and openness, while retaining the recognition that democratic discourse must operate with limits and frontiers.


Effective deliberative discourse is the lynchpin to solving all existential problems~-~--switch-side debate is most effective~-~--our K turns the whole case
Christian O. Lundberg 10 Professor of Communications @ University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, “Tradition of Debate in North Carolina” in Navigating Opportunity: Policy Debate in the 21st Century By Allan D. Louden, p311
The second major problem with the critique that identifies a naivety in articulating debate and democracy is that it presumes that the primary pedagogical outcome of debate is speech capacities. But the democratic capacities built by debate are not limited to speech—as indicated earlier, debate builds capacity for critical thinking, analysis of public claims, informed decision making, and better public judgment. If the picture of modem political life that underwrites this critique of debate is a pessimistic view of increasingly labyrinthine and bureaucratic administrative politics, rapid scientific and technological change outpacing the capacities of the citizenry to comprehend them, and ever-expanding insular special-interest- and money-driven politics, it is a puzzling solution, at best, to argue that these conditions warrant giving up on debate. If democracy is open to rearticulation, it is open to rearticulation precisely because as the challenges of modern political life proliferate, the citizenry&amp;#39;s capacities can change, which is one of the primary reasons that theorists of democracy such as Ocwey in The Public awl Its Problems place such a high premium on education (Dewey 1988,63, 154). Debate provides an indispensible form of education in the modem articulation of democracy because it builds precisely the skills that allow the citizenry to research and be informed about policy decisions that impact them, to son rhroueh and evaluate the evidence for and relative merits of arguments for and against a policy in an increasingly infonnation-rich environment, and to prioritize their time and political energies toward policies that matter the most to them.
The merits of debate as a tool for building democratic capacity-building take on a special significance in the context of information literacy. John Larkin (2005, HO) argues that one of the primary failings of modern colleges and universities is that they have not changed curriculum to match with the challenges of a new information environment. This is a problem for the course of academic study in our current context, but perhaps more important, argues Larkin, for the future of a citizenry that will need to make evaluative choices against an increasingly complex and multimediatcd information environment (ibid-). Larkin&amp;#39;s study tested the benefits of debate participation on information-literacy skills and concluded that in-class debate participants reported significantly higher self-efficacy ratings of their ability to navigate academic search databases and to effectively search and use other Web resources:
To analyze the self-report ratings of the instructional and control group students, we first conducted a multivariate analysis of variance on all of the ratings, looking jointly at the effect of instmction/no instruction and debate topic . . . that it did not matter which topic students had been assigned . . . students in the Instnictional [debate) group were significantly more confident in their ability to access information and less likely to feel that they needed help to do so~-~-~-~-These findings clearly indicate greater self-efficacy for online searching among students who participated in (debate).... These results constitute strong support for the effectiveness of the project on students&amp;#39; self-efficacy for online searching in the academic databases. There was an unintended effect, however: After doing ... the project, instructional group students also felt more confident than the other students in their ability to get good information from Yahoo and Google. It may be that the library research experience increased self-efficacy for any searching, not just in academic databases. (Larkin 2005, 144)
Larkin&amp;#39;s study substantiates Thomas Worthcn and Gaylcn Pack&amp;#39;s (1992, 3) claim that debate in the college classroom plays a critical role in fostering the kind of problem-solving skills demanded by the increasingly rich media and information environment of modernity. Though their essay was written in 1992 on the cusp of the eventual explosion of the Internet as a medium, Worthcn and Pack&amp;#39;s framing of the issue was prescient: the primary question facing today&amp;#39;s student has changed from how to best research a topic to the crucial question of learning how to best evaluate which arguments to cite and rely upon from an easily accessible and veritable cornucopia of materials.
There are, without a doubt, a number of important criticisms of employing debate as a model for democratic deliberation. But cumulatively, the evidence presented here warrants strong support for expanding debate practice in the classroom as a technology for enhancing democratic deliberative capacities. The unique combination of critical thinking skills, research and information processing skills, oral communication skills, and capacities for listening and thoughtful, open engagement with hotly contested issues argues for debate as a crucial component of a rich and vital democratic life. In-class debate practice both aids students in achieving the best goals of college and university education, and serves as an unmatched practice for creating thoughtful, engaged, open-minded and self-critical students who are open to the possibilities of meaningful political engagement and new articulations of democratic life.
Expanding this practice is crucial, if only because the more we produce citizens that can actively and effectively engage the political process, the more likely we are to produce revisions of democratic life that are necessary if democracy is not only to survive, but to thrive. Democracy faces a myriad of challenges, including: domestic and international issues of class, gender, and racial justice; wholesale environmental destruction and the potential for rapid climate change; emerging threats to international stability in the form of terrorism, intervention and new possibilities for great power conflict; and increasing challenges of rapid globalization including an increasingly volatile global economic structure. More than any specific policy or proposal, an informed and active citizenry that deliberates with greater skill and sensitivity provides one of the best hopes for responsive and effective democratic governance, and by extension, one of the last best hopes for dealing with the existential challenges to democracy [in an] increasingly complex world.

Keen citing Drolet ’12, Kip Keen, staff writer for mine web, citing Thomas Drolet, nuclear expert and scientist, 1-24-2012, “Uranium supply crunch by 2016 – nuclear experts says,” http://www.mineweb.com/mineweb/view/mineweb/en/page72103?oid=143915andsn=Detailandpid=102055
A nuclear expert gave uranium supply three more years - at most - before it seriously falls behind demand from the nuclear power industry.
&amp;#34;2016: We have to have supply in the market or the lights will gradually go out in the nuclear system,&amp;#34; said Thomas Drolet, the president of Drolet and Associates Energy Services, during a presentation at Cambridge House&amp;#39;s Vancouver Resource Investment conference on Monday.
A uranium supply crunch is widely anticipated to hit the nuclear industry starting next year as Cold War era sources of uranium dry up. To illustrate the severity of the shortage that the nuclear industry faces, Drolet highlighted 2010 uranium production from mining - 118 million pounds - versus consumption: 190 million pounds.
&amp;#34;You can do the delta difference yourself,&amp;#34; Drolet said, referring to how much of a supply gap miners will have to make up for in coming years.

Jad Mouawad, airline correspondent for The New York Times.

The increased reliance on these unconventional oil sources, including oil sands and shale oil, has led some energy experts to talk about a “re-carbonization” of energy supplies if that reliance distracts from the need to develop renewable fuels.
“As we run out of conventional fossil fuels, we face some fundamental choices

depending which way we go, solving our environmental problems might become impossible.”

Increased domestic production can’t solve dependence and exacerbates warming – causes war

(% class=&amp;#34;Cards&amp;#34; %)
Utility-scale wind turbine blades are large enough that they pass through significantly higher speed winds as they travel through the top of their rotation than nearer to the ground at the bottom, which causes substantial cyclic loading of the blades.

In addition, each turbine in a wind farm creates a turbulent wake that can affect the performance and mechanical loads experienced by the wind turbines downstream.

Turbine wakes interact with each other and are affected by the amount of turbulence in the surrounding winds.

Let us address each of his claims, in reverse order. Mueller suggests that &#xD;
AND&#xD;
? The potential costs would be astronomical, the benefits non-existent.&#xD;
&#xD;
====1— Proliferation is slow and stable. Their authors exaggerate. Iran proves.====&#xD;
**Mueller ~’12**, ~~John Mueller, PhD, is a Senior Research Scientist with the Mershon Center for International Security Studies where he is also the Woody Hayes Chair of National Security Studies, Senior Fellow at the Cato Institute, professor of political science at Ohio State University and the author of Atomic Obsession, &amp;#34;Old fears cloud Western views on Iran~’s nuclear posturing,&amp;#34; 2-18 http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/politics/old-fears-cloud-western-views-on-irans-nuclear-posturing-20120217-1te94.html~~&#xD;
Alarmism about nuclear proliferation is fairly common coin in the foreign policy establishment. And &#xD;
AND&#xD;
have also been exceedingly difficult to obtain for administratively dysfunctional countries like Iran.&#xD;
&#xD;
====2—New arsenals not destabilizing—small arsenals, no aggression, and deterrence solves====&#xD;

Whatever its logical shortcomings, it is important to stress that deterrence worked—it &#xD;
AND&#xD;
desires of its leaders. In short, nuclear weapons deter and dissuade. &#xD;

==Rare Earth Metal DA==

====Rare earth market is stable now – future supply is expanding to meet status quo demand. The plan is a sharp rise in demand that current mines cannot keep up with. That~’s Kuepper====


====Supply will match demand over the long run – but clean tech causes a short term market crunch====

Over the long run, the ramp-up in global production of rare earths 
AND
domestically produced electric cars, rather than supply foreign manufacturers with rare earths. 
One could also imagine a scenario in which cellphones and other existing products received most of the rare earth reserves during a temporary supply stoppage. This possibility worried some automobile manufacturers enough that they began to research alternative materials for clean engines. Indeed, Toyota began this research before China cut access to its rare earth supplies. Nevertheless, it remains uncertain how long it would take for such research to bear fruit. 

====Vote neg on presumption if they win a supply crunch is inevitable – means NO solvency because the turbines/panels cannot be built====


====~~****~~Their arguments that other countries will mine solves this – it proves that over the long run, supply will come online and meet future demand. The problem is what happens in the SHORT TERM.====


====And, the risk is linear – the plan uniquely makes a crunch more likely and faster====

====And, MARKET STABILITY is the framing issue– demand is high but not out of control now. Only a RADICAL change like the plan is perceived====

Even if renewable growth is inevitable, its slow – that gives supply enough time to expand in the status quo. The plan is a MASSIVE CHANGE in renewable policy and supply/demand calculations, which triggers the link. That~’s Kuepper

====If renewables are inevitable there~’s no reason to do the aff – vote neg to avoid short term risk of China war.====

====Alternative REE supplies is a negative argument – it proves that over the long run, other sources will enter the market and stabilize demand. The aff causes a short term crunch because it takes decades for these mines to come online. That~’s Kuepper====

Environmental Concerns Arise
China~’s two-mile wide Baiyun Obo is home to the world~’s biggest mine and the single largest source of rare earth metals in the world. While the mine has certainly helped create jobs and build wealth, the operation comes at an enormous environmental cost, with toxic runoff from the refining process and poisoned lakes where rocks are kept before processing.
Daily Mail~’s Richard Jones reported in 2010 that workers regularly experienced acid burns
AND
opened, it could take some five to 10 years to come online.

====Other countries won~’t mine – environmental costs.====

HEAVIES
The price outlook is stronger for so-called heavy rare earths, which are scarcer and expected to see rising demand in applications such as high performance magnets and energy efficient lighting.
Terbium oxide, mainly used in phosphors for compact fluorescent and LED lighting, has shed slightly over half its value since the peak to %241,750 a kg, FOB China, and Otto expects the long-term price to dip slightly to %241,500/kg.
More volatility is expected as developments could buffet the sector, such as any breakthrough 
AND
people are very uncertain about what the future will hold and rightly so.&amp;#34;

====Rare earth shortage collapses US-China relations – mineral scarcities exacerbate all tensions and force escalating economic rivalry, empirically proven with conflict in the DRC – that~’s White and Cohen====

Prolif solves conflict – group it.
Millions of people die as a result of conventional wars and conventional arms races because there is no incentive to de-escalate conflict.
Prolif is the only way to end conflict – states inevitably miscalculate and have incentives for entering conventional conflict because there’s a limit to their risk. Nukes push the limit to infinity – no one is going to go “all-in” when every hand is a guaranteed loss. That’s Karl and Waltz.

Our interpretation is that an affirmative should defend a topical action by the USfg as the endpoint of their advocacy. This does not mandate roleplaying, immediate fiat or any particular means of impact calculus. 

“USFG should” proscribes both a stable agent and mechanism

The Proposition of Policy: Urging Future Action

AND

the future action that you propose. 

The Aff undermines the ability to have a limited and stable number of Affirmatives to prepare against. This is a reason to vote negative.

First is topic education 
Public sphere debates over engagement with the state energy apparatus prevents energy technocracy and equips us to oppose the dominance of oil, coal, and other elitist interests they criticize

During this phase, the citizen initiative attempted to overcome

AND

politics in modern technological society.61

Topical version of their Aff – Their call to place structural violence first is entirely compatible with a topical advocacy. Resolutional action is crucial to halting environmental injustice
Bullard 8

The environmental justice movement

AND

short term economic remedies for poverty.

Second is Decision-making
Increasing the abstraction of debates and undermining stasis hampers the decision-making benefits of debate
Steinberg, lecturer of communication studies – University of Miami, and Freeley, Boston based attorney who focuses on criminal, personal injury and civil rights law, ‘8
(David L. and Austin J., Argumentation and Debate: Critical Thinking for Reasoned Decision Making p. 45)

Debate is a means of settling differences

which will be outlined in the following discussion.

Decision-making is the most important facet of education we could take away from debate – key to success in any future role
Steinberg, lecturer of communication studies – University of Miami, and Freeley, Boston based attorney who focuses on criminal, personal injury and civil rights law, ‘8
(David L. and Austin J., Argumentation and Debate: Critical Thinking for Reasoned Decision Making p. 9-10)

After several days of intense debate, first

AND

or a vote for our favored political candidate.


Next is substantive side bias
Surely the Aff will say the Neg can still debate them on the substance of their advocacy but not defending the clear actor and mechanism of the resolutional produces a substantive side bias.
Affirmatives that don’t defend the resolution make deploying other strategies against them inordinately Aff tilted. They have the ability to radically recontextualize link arguments, empathize different proscriptive claims of the 1AC while using traditional competition standards like perms to make being impossible inordinately difficult.

And we have an external impact to this net benefit
Sufficient research-based preparation and debates focused on detailed points of disagreement are crucial to transforming political culture
Gutting (professor of philosophy at the University of Notre Dame) 13
(Gary, Feb 19, A Great Debate,  http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/19/a-great-debate/?emc=eta1)

This is the year of what should be a decisive debate

AND

prepared and open to considered responses.

And effective deliberative discourse is the lynchpin to solving all existential problems

The second major problem with the critique

AND

for dealing with the existential challenges to democracy in an increasingly complex world. 


Forth is Mechanism Education
The Aff’s failure to ID a clear mechanism of change has the most devastating effects on the quality of debates. It makes link comparisons vacuous and means that detailed and well prepared PICs about substance, everyone’s favorite and most education part of debate are all but impossible.

We do not need to win that the state is good, rather just that the value of the state is something that should be debated about. This creates another standard for reading the Aff’s evidence – it can’t just indicate that the state or the resolution is bad or ineffective but that they should not even be discussed. Any of the aff’s ev on this account is simply proof that it can be done on the neg – no unique educational benefit to doing it on the aff, only provides an unfair tactical advantage to their arguments.

And this turns the Aff – debates over mechanisms for change are crucial to the success of leftist politics 
Schostak (Professor of Education at Manchester Metropolitan University) 11

Our interpretation is that an affirmative should provide an agent and mechanism of change. The 1ac says affirm the sacrifice of white humanity, but the relevant question is how do we sacrifice white humanity and how do we fight antiblackness.
This is key to productive debates about antiblackness

Ontological Blackness Turn
Their use of ontological blackness creates reliance on white superiority and erases individuality – ontological blackness opposes itself to whiteness, affirming white superiority by grounding blackness in suffering and the experience of anti-blackness – that reduces all experience to negative experience of racial constitution, which crushes individuality and causes social death
