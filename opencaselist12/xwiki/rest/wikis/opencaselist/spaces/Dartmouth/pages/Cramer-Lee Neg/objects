Interpretation –&#xD;
&#xD;
A. Incentives motivate a change in action.  The plan doesn’t incentivize action beyond the purchase of the solar generators, which are already being made.&#xD;
Yusof, 12 - Universiti Sains Malaysia, 11800 Pulau Pinang, Malaysia (Nor’Aini, “THE EFFECTIVENESS OF GOVERNMENT INCENTIVES TO FACILITATE AN INNOVATIVE HOUSING DELIVERY SYSTEM: THE PERSPECTIVE OF HOUSING DEVELOPERS,” Theoretical and Empirical Researches in Urban Management 7. 1  (Feb 2012): 55-68, proquest)&#xD;
In general, incentives can be defined ….. change the way in which they do business.&#xD;
&#xD;
B. This is not like military procurement of reactors which spurs further development of nuclear power. This is they just buy some solar. There is no incentive for doing more.&#xD;
&#xD;
Procurement&amp;#39;s not an incentive&#xD;
Czinkota et al, 9 - Associate Professor at the McDonough School of Business at Georgetown University (Michael, Fundamentals of International Business, p. 69 – google books)&#xD;
Incentives offered by policymakers to facilitate foreign investments………… investments in infrastructure facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
2. Their interpretation is bad-&#xD;
&#xD;
A. Bidirectionality – they can claim to buy all the solar industry to kill it.&#xD;
&#xD;
B. Limits – Guaranteed purchase legitimizes cases like RPS or feed-in-tariffs. Explodes the mechanism of an already huge topic.&#xD;
&#xD;
3. T is a voter because it’s necessary for debate&#xD;

The 1AC’s introduction of death impacts into debate is bad.&#xD;
&#xD;
A) Trivialization. Death debating causes an aesthetic fascination with the spectacle of death. This turns debate into a death cult and denies the choice to avoid death impacts.&#xD;
Jean Baudrillard, Dartmouth BM Hack, ’93 (Symbolic Exchange and Death trans Iain Grant, p. 185-7)&#xD;
Pursued and censured everywhere, death ...put an end to political economy.&#xD;
&#xD;
B) Body Counts. Death debating reduces peoples’ lives to mere numbers for debaters to consume in their game.&#xD;
Jean Baudrillard, Dartmouth BM Hack, ’93 (Symbolic Exchange and Death trans Iain Grant, 162-3, 173-5, “manpower” is left deliberately in)&#xD;
2. More importantly, that ...consumption in social input and output?&#xD;
&#xD;
2. Vote neg because the aff introduced death impacts into the debate.&#xD;
Austin Kutscher, President of the Foundation of Thanatology and Professor – Columbia University, ’80 (Death and Existence, p. Foreward)&#xD;
Within the educational setting, interdisciplinary ...to humankind, collectively and individually.&#xD;
&#xD;
3. This is a gateway argument about how we should be allowed to debate. If they win that we can use death impacts, then the rest of the 1NC applies. We will not make cross-applications from other flows to prove the link.&#xD;

Energy production is defined as the transformation.....into a useful energy form.

Violation – The aff is not tied to energy production. GHG restriction might affect energy production, but itself is not energy reduction.

Vote neg

Limits – tons of bidirectional mechanisms impact energy technology in ways that could increase or decrease production – only directly lifting restriction on increased production creates fair, predictable limits

In some sense, most Federal policies have the......public enterprise, or research and development.

Unpredictable ground – They can claim advantages off of mechanisms that affect energy production. They can claim research benefits off of RandD affs, they can claim warming advantages off of clean coal, etc.

A.Financial incentives exclude coercive action

1.Financial incentives are positive –they only rely on economic reward  
Yusof, 12 - Universiti Sains Malaysia, 11800 Pulau Pinang, Malaysia (Nor’Aini, “THE EFFECTIVENESS OF GOVERNMENT INCENTIVES TO FACILITATE AN INNOVATIVE HOUSING DELIVERY SYSTEM: THE PERSPECTIVE OF HOUSING DEVELOPERS,” Theoretical and Empirical Researches in Urban Management 7. 1  (Feb 2012): 55-68, proquest)
In general, incentives can be defined as ……………the way in which they do business.

2.Financial incentives are different from regulations and policies

Link no longer available but is reprinted here: http://www.mrsolar.com/content/dsire.php

B. Plan violates – the feed-in tariff  is based on a coercive action, the requirement to buy.  Without that requirement, not one would pay the higher price.  An incentive structure might be created, but it is based on the requirement to purchase at a particular price
Ehsan Alishahi, Mohsen P. Moghaddamn , Mohammad K. Sheikh-El-Eslami in 2011,  Energy Policy 39 (2011) 4614–4623,  An investigation on the impacts of regulatory interventions on wind power expansion in generation planning

C. The aff interpretation is bad for debate

Limits are necessary for negative preparation and clash.  

Permitting new requirments makes the topic bi-directional – even if the requirement forces an incentive structure on the market, it increases restrictions to begin with

Also, permitting new regulations as the basis for incentives is unlimiting – there&amp;#39;s no limit to the number of new requirements that could be imposed on energy production 

T is a voter because it is necessary for debate.
