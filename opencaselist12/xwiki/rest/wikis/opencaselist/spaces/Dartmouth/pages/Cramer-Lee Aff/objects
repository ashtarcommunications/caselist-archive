Plan: The United States Federal Government should provide financial incentives for energy production using fuel fabricated with plutonium from dismantled nuclear weapons at a rate compatible with the Plutonium Management and Disposition Agreement. For this energy production, the United States federal government should waive fuel testing requirements, contract fuel fabrication facilities, and automatically grant license amendments.
