==Framework==
Interpretation—the purpose of the ballot is to answer the resolutional question: is the outcome of the enactment of a topical plan by the United States federal government better than the status quo or a competitive policy option?

They claim advantages independent of the plan and the imagination of governmental action. That~’s at best extra topical.

1. &amp;#34;Resolved&amp;#34; before a colon reflects a legislative form.
**Army Officer School** 20**04** (5-12, &amp;#34;~~%23 12, Punctuation – The Colon and Semicolon&amp;#34;, http://usawocc.army.mil/IMI/wg12.htm-http://usawocc.army.mil/IMI/wg12.htm)

The colon introduces the following: a. A list, but only after &amp;#34;
AND
resolved:&amp;#34; Resolved: (colon) That this council petition the mayor.

2. &amp;#34;United States federal government should&amp;#34; means the resolutional question concerns the imagination of outcome of the establishment of a policy by the government.
Jon M. **Ericson** 20**03** (Dean Emeritus of the College of Liberal Arts – California Polytechnic U., et al., The Debater~’s Guide, Third Edition, p. 4)

The Proposition of Policy: Urging Future Action In policy propositions, each topic contains 
AND
compelling reasons for an audience to perform the future action that you propose.

Reasons to prefer—
1. Fairness:
 
A. Predictable limits—there are limitless investigations of democracy assistance and debate practice, but the grammar of the resolution is based on enacting a policy. We can~’t predict the infinite number of critical positions the aff allows because they are disconnected from the resolutional question of demands for government action.

B. Ground—their framework makes stable ground impossible because they can always claim ~’critical~’ outweigh disads to the plan or shift their advocacy to avoid impact turns—must hold them to a central question for productive argumentation and idea testing to occur.  

2. Education:
A. Switch-side testing—changing the ballot from a yes/no question about desirability of the plan undermines effective argumentation because there is no point of stasis to continually re-interrogate, removing the ability to test their ideas and others. 
And, this idea testing is the best model for creating understanding and fostering tolerance.
