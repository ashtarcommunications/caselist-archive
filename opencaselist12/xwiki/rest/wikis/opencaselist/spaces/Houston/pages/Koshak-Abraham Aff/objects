Hydraulic fracturing is used by gas producers to stimulate wells and recover natural gas from &#xD;

====Regulators need to promote alternative forms of fracking to offset costs and wastes ====&#xD;

Regulators have recently moved to control the surface disposal of hydraulic fracturing wastewater more stringently&#xD;
AND&#xD;
CO2,(67) and even liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).(68)&#xD;

====Creates massive delays for conventional fracking. ====&#xD;
&#xD;
**Platts 12** Proposed BLM fracking rule has no scientific basis: IECA Houston (Platts)—18Jun2012 http://www.platts.com/RSSFeedDetailedNews/RSSFeed/NaturalGas/6394906&#xD;
Cicio told Platts that he worried that the imposition of additional regulations on the production &#xD;
AND&#xD;
states have voiced their objections to the proposed new federal regulation of fracking.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
==Plan Text: The United States federal government should exempt Carbon Dioxide Fracturing from restrictions promulgated under Regulation Identifier Number 1004-AE26.==&#xD;
&#xD;
==Advantage 1- Hydraulic Fracking==&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
====Hydraulic fracking pollutes groundwater and destroy the ecosystem====&#xD;
**Bishop 11** (&amp;#34;Chemical and Biological Risk Assessment for Natural Gas Extraction in New York&amp;#34; Ronald E. Bishop, Ph.D., CHO Chemistry %26 Biochemistry Department State University of New York, College at Oneonta March 28, 2011, http://www.sustainableotsego.org/Risk%20Assessment%20Natural%20Gas%20Extraction-1.htm)&#xD;
&#xD;
Over the last decade, operators in the natural gas industry have developed highly sophisticated &#xD;
AND&#xD;
the objective is to evaluate risk related to the industry as a whole.&#xD;
&#xD;
====This kills the ecosystem through methane leaks and groundwater contamination====&#xD;
**Bishop 11** (&amp;#34;Chemical and Biological Risk Assessment for Natural Gas Extraction in New York&amp;#34; Ronald E.

&#xD;
As stated above, the working hypothesis for this risk assessment is that future impacts &#xD;
AND&#xD;
GWPC maintains lower standards for public safety and health than these other evaluators.&#xD;
&#xD;
====Ecosystem decline and species loss risk extinction====&#xD;
**Warner 94** (Paul Warner, American University, Dept of International Politics and Foreign Policy, August, Politics and Life Sciences, 1994, p 177)&#xD;
&#xD;
Massive extinction of species is dangerous, then, because one cannot predict which species &#xD;
AND&#xD;
is like playing Russian roulette, with our collective future as the stakes.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
==Advantage 2- Economy==&#xD;
&#xD;
===Scenario 1 is competitveness===&#xD;
&#xD;
====Natural gas boosts industry and competitiveness—key to the econ====&#xD;

&#xD;
The precipitous decline of natural gas prices — to less than %242 per 1&#xD;
AND&#xD;
gas in our country will boost economic growth for many years to come.&#xD;

&#xD;
====US crisis tanks the global economy====&#xD;
**RAHMAN ~’11** - former Ambassador and Chairman of the Centre for Foreign Affairs Studies. (Ashfaqur . &amp;#34;Another global recession?&amp;#34;. August 21. http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=199461)&#xD;
&#xD;
Several developments, especially in Europe and the US, fan this fear. First&#xD;
AND&#xD;
we may be in a new double dip or W-shaped recession. &#xD;

Two neatly opposed scenarios for the future of the world order illustrate the range of &#xD;
AND&#xD;
theocratic absolutes, competing or converging with secular absolutes such as unbridled nationalism.&#xD;
&#xD;
===Scenario 2 is the US Dollar===&#xD;
&#xD;
====Natural gas development lets the U.S. close the trade deficit and strengthen the dollar====&#xD;

Strange as it may seem, conventional economics 101 may not currently work for the &#xD;
AND&#xD;
new U.S. jobs if the regulatory environment uncertainty is reduced.&#xD;
Second, since its arrival, the Euro has served as an alternative to the &#xD;
AND&#xD;
. Reduced input prices lead to increased output demand, jobs and income.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
==Advantage 3- Warming ==&#xD;
&#xD;
====Warming is real and anthropogenic - Prefer scientific consensus to their hack deniers====&#xD;
&#xD;
Lewandowsky and Ashley ~’11 (Stephan Lewandowsky, Professor of Cognitive Studies at the University of Western Australia, and Michael Ashley, Professor of Astrophysics at the University of New South Wales, June 24, 2011, &amp;#34;The false, the confused and the mendacious: how the media gets it wrong on climate change,&amp;#34; http://goo.gl/u3nOC)&#xD;
&#xD;
But despite these complexities, some aspects of climate science are thoroughly settled. We &#xD;

**Nordhaus and Shellenberger ~’12** (Ted Nordhaus, energy analyst and chairman of the Breakthrough Institute, and Michael Shellenberger, energy analyst, author and president of the Breakthrough Institute, February 27, 2012, &amp;#34;Beyond Cap and Trade, A New Path to Clean Energy,&amp;#34; Yale Environment 360, http://goo.gl/dtQf4)&#xD;
&#xD;
A funny thing happened while environmentalists were trying and failing to cap carbon emissions in &#xD;
AND&#xD;
fossil fuels. There simply is no substitute for making clean energy cheap. &#xD;
&#xD;
====Fracking solves- Low gas prices spur the transition to natural gas====&#xD;

The shale gas revolution is doing a lot more than just making renewables seem more &#xD;

We contend, moreover, that not only is U.S. participation critical&#xD;

impact is significant.&amp;#34;4 Little progress is made without the United States. &#xD;

We need to get prepared for four degrees of global warming, Bob Watson told &#xD;

The dramatic lessening of Europe~’s dependence on Russian gas will likely have considerable geopolitical implications &#xD;

Yesin: Should the Russian-American war begin, it will inevitably deteriorate into the Third World War. The United States is a NATO member and this bloc believes in collective security. In fact, collective security is what it is about.  Vladimirov: This war will inevitably deteriorate into a nuclear conflict. Regardless of what weapons will be used in the first phase.&#xD;
