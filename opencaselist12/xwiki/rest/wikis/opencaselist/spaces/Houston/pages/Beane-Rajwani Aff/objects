The Treasury Department said last week that blocking the Oregan project was done to protect

Former US Trade Representative Carla Hills said that she believes Chinese investment in the US 
AND
who is also chairwoman of the National Committee on US-China Relations.

====Restricting energy development on the basis that foreign investment is a threat to national security sends the signal that the US energy market is off limit and stifles US-China energy cooperation====

====Warming results in extinction====
**Ahmed 2010** (Nafeez Ahmed, Executive Director of the Institute for Policy Research and Development, professor of International Relations and globalization at Brunel University and the University of Sussex, Spring/Summer 2010, &amp;#34;Globalizing Insecurity: The Convergence of Interdependent Ecological, Energy, and Economic Crises,&amp;#34; Spotlight on Security, Volume 5, Issue 2, online)

Preliminary reviews of scientiﬁc literature and surveys of climate scientists indicate striking agreement with the 
AND
discussions in media, policy, and public forums regarding anthropogenic climate change.



==Plan==

====Thus, we present the following plan:====

====Plan – The United States federal government should limit the review of foreign investment in wind power by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States to cases in which national security, not economic competition is a factor.====



==Solvency==

====Contention 3 is Solvency - ====

====Reversal of the CFIUS decision on wind energy is critical to send a signal that the US is open to investment. ====

CFIUS practitioners and the business community should watch this case closely. The plaintiffs will 
AND
for interested parties to express their views through amicus filings with the court.

====Further, only explicitly removing economic competition from the scope of investment review solves.====
David M. **Marchick %26** Matthew J. **Slaughter 2008** The Bernard and Irene Schwartz Series on American Competitiveness Global FDI Policy Correcting a Protectionist Drift CSR NO. 34, JUNE 2008 COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS

Principle 1: The investment review law should be narrowly tailored and focused on national 
AND
investment in transactions that do not raise national security or other governmental interests.

====And, The broad interpretation of national security fails – creates economic uncertainty, protectionism and hampers US foreign policy goals.====
**Carroll-Emory International Law Review-09** (Jamie FF, COMMENT: BACK TO THE FUTURE: REDEFINING THE FOREIGN INVESTMENT AND NATIONAL SECURITY ACT~’S CONCEPTION OF NATIONAL SECURITY, 23 Emory Int~’l L. Rev. 167)

The broad and vague interpretation of national security by the CFIUS creates four distinct problems
AND
foreign policy goals, just when such cooperation is essential to global peace.

====Finally, Only a narrow wind-energy specific Limit to national security solves, the plan creates clarity and predictability. ====
David **Marchick 2008** Sovereign Wealth Funds And National Security OECD/City of London ConferenceMarch 31, 2008 www.oecd.org/investment/investmentpolicy/40395077.pdf
How Should National Security Review Mechanisms be Structured? ➢ Narrowly tailored ▪ The investment
AND
requiring investment reviews, the lists should be drafted as narrowly as possible. 






==Other Advantage Modules==


===Economy - FDI===

====Chinese FDI to the US declined sharply in 2012 but could rebound if the US takes steps to liberalize its national security FDI policy towards China.====


====Continuation of Ralls destroys FDI. ====

====Sharp Declines in Chinese FDI in 2012 but it~’s not too late. ====
**Hanemann 12-28** (Theo, research director at the Rhodium Group and leads the firm~’s cross-border investment work, Chinese FDI in the US in 2012, http://rhgroup.net/notes/chinese-direct-investmnet-in-the-u-s-in-2012-a-record-year-amid-a-gloomy-fdi-environment-http://rhgroup.net/notes/chinese-direct-investmnet-in-the-u-s-in-2012-a-record-year-amid-a-gloomy-fdi-environment)

B. National Security and Investor Uncertainty The uncertain interpretation of national security in Exon
AND
foreign investment is more vital than ever to provide liquidity to American markets.


====Abuse of FINSA risks total FDI Collapse. ====

Finally, U.S. leadership would help preclude the rise of another hostile global rival, enabling the United States and the world to avoid another global cold or hot war and all the attendant dangers, including a global nuclear exchange. U.S. leadership would therefore be more conducive to global stability than a bipolar or a multipolar balance of power system.

==Geophilosophy 1AC V2.0==

====Emerged from the ground, produced in the factory and consumed by machines, energy becomes a powerful point of convergence for the social and political strata that seeks to contain and assimilate us all into its theatre of sameness. ====

====But what makes energy production such a powerful tool of control over the masses? For this we turn to a new interpretation of life that concludes that our capacity to act is not separable from our relations with the world, nature or energy. ====
Hayden 2k8 (Patrick, Writer on things about Deleuze and Guattari, All around smart guy, &amp;#34;Gilles Deleuze and Naturalism: A Convergence with Ecological Theory and Politics&amp;#34; Pg. 31-33 ~~EB~~)
Another way that Deleuze develops his naturalism is by arguing for the inclusion of ethology 
AND
, what must be considered now are the political aspects of Deleuze~’s naturalism.

====It is with this that we welcome you to Dallas, Texas where oil fields, electric cars and Tom Delay are all bleeding profits at increasingly high rates of speed. Unfortunately, this capitalist profit motive locks us into a devastating mono-vision where energy production is turned into a utilitarian search that champions industry culture while blocking the view of real devastation.====
Chisholm 2k7 (Dianne, writer for Rhizomes, Rhizomes. 15 Winter 2007, &amp;#34;Rhizome, Ecology, Geophilosophy (A Map to this Issue)~~EB~~)
To introduce these contributions, we begin with Mark Halsey, whose essay &amp;#34;Deleuze
AND
tree and most forests will be lost to a devastating mono-vision.

====Through this mono-vision the state begins eliminating difference through mapping the earth. This dangerous representational logic judges the affective realm of nature through a calculative lens that brings difference in line when it strays from the grotesquely denatured marvel it has erected in its place. ====
Halsey 2k4 (Mark, Prof @ Flinders U. Environmental Visions: Deleuze and the Modalities of Nature, Ethics and the Environment ~~EB~~)
I mentioned there was one exception to the general trend where by Goolengook has been 
AND
invisible by various units of management and at what cost such invisibility occurs.


====This industry culture and representational logic have ultimately put us on the brink of extinction as capitalism has driven us to eco-cide under the guise of an ontology that captures affective capacity to act and creates static subjects that serve the state and capitalism. Human subjectivity is now an endangered species. ====
Pindar and Sutton 2k (Ian and Paul, They wrote the intro to and translated Guattari~’s Three Ecologies, The Three Ecologies, pg. 3-7.)
In The Three Ecologies Guattari objects that we have challenged the Earth enough and are 
AND
), so it is only to be expected that the singing has stopped.

====Before affect is controlled by the state we exist as pure potential for action, but once affect is delimited and captured, it is turned into emotion and fuels action. Once a transcendent structure captures one~’s ability to act, it control~’s a body~’s subjectivity, identity and end, justifying all forms of violence in politics.====
Beasley-Murray 09 (Jon Beasley-Murray, Assistant Professor in Hispanic Studies, including social and political theory, &amp;#34;PART TWO: CONSTITUTION&amp;#34; http://faculty.arts.ubc.ca/jbmurray/research/jbm_escalon.pdf )
Affect is, for Deleuze and Spinoza, an index of power: we may 
AND
but also demonstrates reason~’s addicted dependence upon sensual as well as spiritual stimulation.

====The state~’s subjugation of affective politics is what created Nazism, enables all forms of violence and makes a subject powerless to act. ====
Protevi 2k10 (John Protevi; Dept. of French Studies @ LSU, Deleuzian Scholar and Magician; &amp;#34;Deleuze And Wexler: Thinking Brain, Body and Affect in Social Context&amp;#34;; http://www.protevi.com/john/Deleuze_Wexler.pdf ~~EB~~)
For Deleuze and Guattari, affect is inherently political: bodies are part of an 
AND
enable them to form new and mutually empowering encounters outside the original encounter?

====It is because of this that Eric and I affirm a removal of the affective ethical restrictions on topical energy production.====

====In order to remove this affective restriction on energy production, we must view life and all its connections as machines. This breaks down the dialecticism of subject versus object and forecloses the possibility of static identity or end, while preserving our affective capacity to act and affirming life. ====
Colebrook 2k2 (Claire Mary Colebrook, Doctor of Philosophy (University of Edinburgh, 1993), English professor at Penn State University, &amp;#34;Gilles Deleuze&amp;#34; (Routledge Critical Thinkers).
One of the key ideas that runs throughout Deleuze~’s work and which links his philosophy 
AND
with the mind or brain being one (sophisticated) machine among others.

====It is through this process of viewing life as a machine that we have the unique ability to engage in a revolutionary act of becoming that has the potential to radically reorient how we interact with energy production and nature as a whole.====
Hayden 2k8 (Patrick, Writer on things about Deleuze and Guattari, All around smart guy, &amp;#34;Gilles Deleuze and Naturalism: A Convergence with Ecological Theory and Politics&amp;#34;  pg. 29-31 ~~EB~~)
In works written in collaboration with Félix Guattari, Deleuze continues to articulate a strongly 
AND
heterogeneous and jumping from one already differentiated line to another. (10)

====Becoming makes the maintenance of dualisms impossible-instead it focuses on the possibility of fractured, fluid identity.  This respects the singular nature of one~’s situation and recognizes multiplicity in the world====
Birke %26 Parisi 99 (Lynda %26 Luciana, Animal Others Chapter 3, &amp;#34;Animal Becoming&amp;#34;)
The relationship between women and animals is not, then, about essences or identification
AND
individual selves) and toward thinking of fluidity. 67-68


====Our method causes an interrogation of transcendence, asserting the question of debate as given before it has started, inscribes the transcendental onto the space of argument which forecloses the possibility of immanence.====
Conway 2k10 (Jay; Prof of Phil @ Cal State, For the past decade Jay has been writing and lecturing on the works of Gilles Deleuze, the history of metaphysics and the social-political theory.; &amp;#34;Gilles Deleuze: Affirmation in Philosophy&amp;#34; Pg. 108-110 ~~EB~~
As for the term &amp;#34;debate,&amp;#34; it is inadequate for Deleuzian critique because it

(for the sake of scientific inquiry) language as a homogeneous object.
