====The U.S. needs a national FiT to incentivize clean energy production====
**Aguillon 12 **
( Cecilia, 8/7/12, Director of market development for Kyocera Solar, &amp;#34;Feed-In Tariffs: A Good FIT for the U.S. Solar Market&amp;#34;, [[http://www.dailyenergyreport.com/2012/08/feed-in-tariffs-a-good-fit-for-the-u-s-solar-market/-http://www.dailyenergyreport.com/2012/08/feed-in-tariffs-a-good-fit-for-the-u-s-solar-market/]], Dil)
You might be scratching your head at this point, thinking, &amp;#34;Why are Japan, Italy and Germany ahead of the U.S. in adopting solar power?&amp;#34;

Much of the answer lies in policy: The U.S. relies on tax breaks to incentivize solar, while the rest of the world uses some variation of the FIT program. The difference is key. A FIT program rewards people who invest in solar energy according to how much power they generate, in kilowatt hours (kWh). A tax incentive rewards solar adopters according to how much money they spent on their system.

Under a FIT, the system owner gets paid only for the electricity they produce, thus creating a strong disincentive against technologies that are unproven or don~’t perform well over time. The U.S. tax incentive system, by contrast, doesn~’t reward the performance of a system at all — only the cost.

America~’s investment tax credit works poorly for two reasons. First, not everyone who wants the benefits of clean, renewable energy can benefit from tax incentives. Second, since U.S. tax credits are based on the system~’s cost, higher system prices are rewarded as a matter of policy — doing little to make solar energy more affordable for consumers.

&amp;#34;The U.S. needs a system — like a feed-in-tariff — that rewards performance,&amp;#34; said Tom Dyer, a 40-year industry veteran who recently retired as Kyocera Solar, Inc.~’s vice president. &amp;#34;This would promote systems that are more likely to produce optimum power for decades, as opposed to incentivizing financial investment and de-emphasizing power production.&amp;#34;

Already, in Hawaii and parts of California, it~’s as economical to install solar as it is to buy power from the grid, according to Dyer, which is known as grid parity. Grid parity is key to making solar energy more widely available, and the FIT program offers a fast track to get there.

In addition to providing solar product manufacturers with an incentive to improve system quality and 
AND
already live and work – distributed generation won~’t disturb protected lands or wildlife.

Europe and Japan have demonstrated that when a solar incentive program is based on actual 
AND
in the same way that distributed generation provides power &amp;#34;close to home.&amp;#34;
