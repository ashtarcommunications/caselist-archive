==Elections – 1NC==


====Obama~’s Increasing his Lead – September Jobs Report Shows Unemployment at an all-time low this term====
**New York Time 10/5** &amp;#34;Drop in Jobless Figure Gives Jolt to Race for President,&amp;#34; http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/06/business/economy/us-added-114000-jobs-in-september-rate-drops-to-7-8.html?pagewanted=all%26pagewanted=print%26_r=0-http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/06/business/economy/us-added-114000-jobs-in-september-rate-drops-to-7-8.html?pagewanted=all%26pagewanted=print%26_r=0
The jobless rate abruptly dropped in September to its lowest level since the month President 
AND
it merely confirmed that millions of Americans had given up looking for work.


====Massive public opposition to nuclear power – viewed as too risky ====
Ramana, Princeton University Program on Science and Global Security Physicist, 11
(M.V. August 3, &amp;#34;Nuclear power and the public,&amp;#34; http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/features/nuclear-power-and-the-public-http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/features/nuclear-power-and-the-public, d/a 7-20-12, ads)
Japan is by no means alone. Around the world, nuclear energy has declined 
AND
it unlikely that a large-scale &amp;#34;nuclear renaissance&amp;#34; will materialize. 


====Obama Popularity key and can still swing====
**Cook, 12  (**Charlie, Cook Political Report, National Journal, 4/12, http://cookpolitical.com/node/12364-http://cookpolitical.com/node/12364)
When a president runs for reelection, his job-approval ratings are more significant 
AND
Obama~’s approval rating at 48 percent and his disapproval score at 47 percent.


====Romney will rollback EPA CO2 emission standards —- results in CO2 emissions and air pollution.====
**Star Ledger 12** (June 03, 2012, &amp;#34;Scary times for environment — especially if Mitt Romney wins&amp;#34;, http://blog.nj.com/njv_editorial_page/2012/06/scary_times_for_environment_—.html)
The grim report on jobs Friday greatly improves the odds that Republicans will win in 
AND
Republicans win in November, any chance of passage will be snuffed out.

====Unchecked global warming causes extinction.====
**Tickell 2008** (Oliver, Climate Researcher, The Guardian, &amp;#34;On a Planet 4C Hotter, All We Can Prepare for is Extinction&amp;#34;, 8-11, http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/aug/11/climatechange)
We need to get prepared for four degrees of global warming, Bob Watson told 
AND
warming caused by human emissions could propel us towards a similar hothouse Earth. 


==CP – 1NC==
The United States federal government should obtain Japanese funding for the expansion of loan guarantees for domestic civilian nuclear power.

====Japan solves 100% of case====
- Hiruo ~’8 (Japan clears way for loan guarantees in US, Japan clears way for loan guarantees in US  BYLINE: Elaine Hiruo, Washington  SECTION: Pg. 1 Vol. 49 No. 39, Created: September 26, 2008

A Cabinet-level decision in Japan has opened the way for that country to 
AND
a viable applicant increases as its dependence on a DOE loan guarantee decreases. 



====Solves US incentives – opening new plants to foreign investment solves leadership. ====
Steve **Skutnik, September 5, 2012**, A cost-free way to open up nuclear investment, Ph.D. in nuclear engineering, University of Tennessee Assistant Professor of Nuclear Engineering http://theenergycollective.com/skutnik/109611/cost-free-way-open-nuclear-investment
 Given the difficulty then, it seems positively insane for any political leadership to 
AND
to happen is for leaders to be willing to say, &amp;#34;Oui.&amp;#34;


==1NC – On Case – Electricity Prices==

====Wall Street still won~’t invest despite massive subsidies- the non-cost- competitive plants won~’t get built====
Lovins, Sheikh, and Markevich ~’8 (Amory B. Lovins, Imran Sheikh, and Alex Markevich, Mr. Lovins, a physicist, is cofounder, Chairman, and Chief Scientist of Rocky Mountain Institute, where Mr. Sheikh is a Research Analyst and Dr. Markevich is a Vice President. Mr. Lovins has consulted for scores of electric utilities, many of them nuclear operators, April 28, 2008, &amp;#34;Forget Nuclear&amp;#34;, )

Such high, and highly uncertain, costs now make financing prohibitively expensive for free
AND
only about as many nuclear plants as they can force taxpayers to buy.


====Nuclear incentives fail – plants are not competitive====
**Bradford 12** (Peter, Adjunct professor teaching nuclear power and public policy at Vermont Law School, served on the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 1977–82. Nature 483, p. 151–152 08 March 2012)
In the United States, where no new reactor has received a construction permit since 
AND
-energy sources should have to compete with each other in the marketplace.


====Nuclear power plants take too long to build====
- Ferguson ~’7 (Ferguson and Squassoni, Charles D. Ferguson is a fellow for science and technology at the Council on Foreign Relations and is the author of the Council Special Report &amp;#34;Nuclear Energy: Balancing Benefits and Risks.&amp;#34;, Sharon Squassoni is a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace., 2007, &amp;#34;Why Nuclear Energy Isn~’t the Great Green Hope&amp;#34;, http://a4nr.org/library/globalwarmingclimatechange/06.2007-foreignpolicy, )

Typically, U.S. nuclear plants have required around 10 to 12 years 
AND
are already higher than other electricity options, even given significant government subsidies.  


====There isn~’t enough uranium to scale up nuclear power	====
Romm ~’8 (Joe Romm, June 2008, &amp;#34;The Self-Limiting Future of Nuclear Power&amp;#34;, Center for American Progress Action Fund, ), 

Uranium supply is also an issue. Most major carbon-free power sources have 
AND
five decades has been a steady decline in most average country ore grades.… 
 
As global temperatures rise nuclear power can~’t operate
Olson ~’6 ((Mary Olson, Director of the Southeast Office, Nuclear Information and Resource Service, May 3, 2006, Confronting a False Myth of Nuclear Power: Nuclear Power Expansion is Not a Remedy for Climate Change, Commission on Sustainable Development, United Nations, )

Nuclear power is also incapable of operating in hot water, as evidenced by the 
AND
and less qualified as a means to even try to generate electric power. 


==1NC On Case – Nuclear Leadership==


====Expanding nuclear power hurts credibility – safety issues====
Walsh 11 (Wednesday, Mar 16, 2011 05:17 PM MST  The nuclear credibility gap  As Japan and U.S. officials differ on risks, the Obama administration pushes ahead with nuclear power expansion  By Joan Walsh, http://www.salon.com/2011/03/17/nuclear_credibility_gap/)
I~’m inclined to believe Jaczko, as well as warnings from U.S. 
AND
any administration leader is making a full steam ahead commitment to nuclear expansion.

**====A. Expanding nuclear power requires additional onsite storage  ====**
**Alvarez 2** (Former Senior Policy Adviser in the Energy Department)
Robert, What About the Spent Fuel, Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, Vol. 58, p. 45, January/February.
Will more gates, guards, and guns be enough? About 40,000 
AND
fuel.... This has become a fact of life for nuclear power stations.&amp;#34; 

**====B. Increasing nuclear power without credible waste storage turns case and undermines nuclear leadership====**
**Werner 12 (**James D., Section Research Manager, Congressional Research Service, ~’U.S. Spent Nuclear Fuel Storage,&amp;#34; May 24)
Fourth, some have argued that the uncertainty and concerns about nuclear waste management have 
AND
State authority, however, is limited under the Atomic Energy Act.54


====The regulation system is under strain- expanding nuclear power results in unchecked proliferation and terrorist attacks====
- Makhijani ~’3 (Arjun Makhijani, President of the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research in Takoma Park, Maryland., 2003, Atomic Myths, Radioactive Realities:Why nuclear power is a poor way to meet energy needs, http://www.sric.org/voices/2003/v4n4/arjun_makhijani.html, _

The proliferation implications of building so many plants and supplying them with fuel are stupendous
AND
is extending the licenses of power plants without allowing consideration of terrorism risks.  



====Turns the case – IAEA safeguards missions are necessary to enforce the NPT and stop nuclear terrorism. Budget shortfalls constrain this mission. ====

Budget constraints are jeopardizing the International Atomic Energy Agency~’s (IAEA) ability to perform 
AND
provides assistance to states to help them prevent the theft of nuclear material.


====These budget shortfalls cause cut backs on safety and cause nuclear meltdowns. ====
Ivonne Marschall Jun 22, 2007, IAEA warns cash shortage will affect nuclear security work
http://news.monstersandcritics.com/europe/features/article_1321201.php/IAEA_warns_cash_shortage_will_affect_nuclear_security_work

Unusually candidly the IAEA chief told the delegates that the agency would fail to properly 
AND
incident and emergency centre would be hard pressed to carry out its functions.
 

====Terrorists will steal nuclear material- results in nuclear terrorism====
- Greenpeace ~’5 (Greenpeace, June 2005, &amp;#34;NUCLEAR POWER UNDERMINES SOLUTIONS TO CLIMATE CHANGE&amp;#34;, http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/content/australia/resources/reports/nuclear-power/nuclear-undermines-solutions.pdf, )

An expansion of the nuclear industry would further increase risks from terrorism and proliferation of 
AND
spent fuel transports, and waste facilities should be regarded as potential targets.





====New nuclear power will overload the regulation regime====
- Squassoni ~’7 (Sharon Squassoni, May 2007 &amp;#34;Risks and Realities: The &amp;#34;New Nuclear Energy Revival&amp;#34;, http://www.armscontrol.org/act/2007_05/squassoni.asp, )

The expansion of nuclear power could have cascading effects on the nuclear nonproliferation regime, 
AND
such facilities could place significant strain on the IAEA and the safeguards system.

The Department of Energy will spend %24452 million—with a match from industry
AND
economics don~’t work in the favor of SMRs,&amp;#34; according to the summary.


====Small reactors take too long to come online – natural gas will have taken over====
