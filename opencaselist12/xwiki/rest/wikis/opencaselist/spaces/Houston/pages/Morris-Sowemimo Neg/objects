DOE defines &amp;#34;United States&amp;#34; as follows:3

Many planned off-shore renewable energy projects are designed to derive energy from wind

There is precedent for using such a definition of ocean waters as they relate to the United States: DOE has used a similar definition in its Final Rule on Renewable Energy Production Incentives.5

Vote negative—-all of the energy production for the aff occurs outside the US—-this explodes the topic because it makes all battlefield energy shifts topical, allows demos in foreign countries and drives the topic toward affs that make very little dent on the domestic energy make-up.

I plan to write up some observations soon from a couple of trips I made 
AND
the White House and Congress horse-trade in favor of higher priorities.




==== Immigration reform is necessary to revive the economy. ====
Ezra **Klein 1/31/13** Worried about the economy? Then pass immigration reform  http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/01/31/worried-about-the-economy-then-pass-immigration-reform/
Washington tends to have a narrow view of what counts as &amp;#34;economic policy.&amp;#34; 
AND
business owners. Immigration reform is a way to get more of both.



====Econ decline causes nuclear war====
**Mead 9. ~~**2/4, Walter Russell, Henry A. Kissinger Senior Fellow in U.S. Foreign Policy at the Council on Foreign Relations, Only Makes You Stronger: Why the recession bolstered America, The New Republic~~
None of which means that we can just sit back and enjoy the recession. 
AND
the world economy back on track, we may still have to fight. 

Warming Answers- Frontline


====1. No warming- Newest peer review studies prove ====
Taylor ~’11 (7/27- senior fellow for environment policy at the Heartland Institute (2011, &amp;#34;New NASA Data Blow Gaping Hole In Global Warming Alarmism,&amp;#34; Forbes, http://blogs.forbes.com/jamestaylor/2011/07/27/new-nasa-data-blow-gaping-hold-in-global-warming-alarmism/) 

NASA satellite data from the years 2000 through 2011 show the Earth~’s atmosphere is allowing 
AND
great deal about how honest the purveyors of global warming alarmism truly are. 


====2. Negative feedbacks solve- No tipping point ====
McShane 8 (Owen, the chairman of the policy panel of the New Zealand Climate Science Coalition and director of the Center for Resource Management Studies, 4-4-8, The National Business Review (New Zealand), &amp;#34;Climate change confirmed but global warming is cancelled&amp;#34;, Lexis)

Atmospheric scientists generally agree that as carbon dioxide levels increase there is a law of 
AND
to Spencer agreeing that he is right%21 There goes the alarmist neighbourhood%21 


====3. Can~’t solve warming – no country will get on board====
Hale ~’11 - PhD Candidate in the Department of Politics at Princeton University and a Visiting Fellow at LSE Global Governance, London School of Economics (Thomas, &amp;#34;A Climate Coalition of the Willing,&amp;#34; Washington Quarterly, Winter, http://www.twq.com/11winter/docs/11winter_Hale.pdf

Intergovernmental efforts to limit the gases that cause climate change have all but failed. 
AND
successor to the Kyoto Protocol, at least not in the near future.


====4. Warming doesn~’t cause extinction====
Lomborg ~’8 (Director of the Copenhagen Consensus Center and adjunct professor at the Copenhagen Business School, Bjorn, &amp;#34;Warming warnings get overheated&amp;#34;, The Guardian, 8/15, http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/aug/15/carbonemissions.climatechange-http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/aug/15/carbonemissions.climatechange

These alarmist predictions are becoming quite bizarre, and could be dismissed as sociological oddities

====1. The Unipolar Moment is over and can~’t be recovered - Even if the United States is the preeminent power, the financial crash of 08 means that they won~’t be able to prevent competition====

**Rachman 11** 	(Gideon Rachman, Financial Times chief foreign affairs commentator, Zero-Sum Future, 2011, pp 3-4)

But the economic crisis that struck the world in 2008 has changed the logic of 
AND
the &amp;#34;unipolar moment&amp;#34; that began with the collapse of the Soviet Union

====2. Heg doesn~’t solve war –====

====A. No threats require primacy and other factors ensure security.====
**Friedman and Preble 10** (Benjamin Friedman is a research fellow in defense and homeland security studies at the Cato Institute, Christopher Preble is director of foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute, Budgetary Savings from Military Restraint, September 22, 2010 Cato Policy Analysis No. 667 September 23, 2010 http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/PA667.pdf
The United States confuses what it wants from its military, which is global primacy 
AND
resentment. Global military primacy is a game not worth the candle.56

====B. No war – States have an incentive to avoid it.====
**Zakaria 08** (Fareed Zakaria, editor of Newsweek International, 2008, The Post-American World,  p. 244)
In certain areas – the South China Sea, for example – U.S
AND
futile and unnecessary.  Small work-arounds might be just as effective.

====3. Heg inevitable.====
**Goldberg 11** ( January 28 2011 &amp;#34;America~’s China Syndrome&amp;#34; AEIPPR American Enterprise Institute For Public Policy Research http://www.aei.org/article/103022-http://www.aei.org/article/103022)
It~’s true that from the early 1990s until around now, America has been essentially 
AND
In that sense, the new normal looks a lot like the old normal

====Status quo solves – none of their cards talk about how the status quo isn~’t sufficient for a military transition, and when questioned in CX they don~’t answer this====

====1. Making the PTC permanent slows the pace of wind industry growth. ====
Greg **Jenner 10/18/12 **&amp;#34;Economists Weigh in on the PTC Extension&amp;#34; http://www.lawofrenewableenergy.com/2012/10/articles/wind-energy/economists-weigh-in-on-the-ptc-extension/
According to CRS: Maybe. By its lights, a one year extension of 
AND
a negative effect on wind development as utilities opt for lowest cost resources.



====2. Diversification turn – the plan locks in mature technology because it isn~’t performance based. ====
Jesse **Jenkins, et al April 2012** Director of Energy and Climate Policy, Breakthrough Institute Mark Muro, Senior Fellow, Metropolitan Policy Program, Brookings Institution Ted Nordhaus and Michael Shellenberger, Cofounders, Breakthrough Institute Letha Tawney, Senior Associate, World Resources Institute Alex Trembath, Policy Associate, Breakthrough Institute &amp;#34;Beyond Boom %26 Bust&amp;#34; http://thebreakthrough.org/blog/Beyond_Boom_and_Bust.pdf-http://thebreakthrough.org/blog/Beyond_Boom_and_Bust.pdf

Many of today~’s clean tech deployment subsidies and policies should be reformed with these criteria 
AND
portfolio, and put clean tech segments on track to full subsidy independence.

====Status quo solves - The Retuccia card explains that wind is growing in spite of the PTC~’s impermanence. Their plan isn~’t necessary.====
