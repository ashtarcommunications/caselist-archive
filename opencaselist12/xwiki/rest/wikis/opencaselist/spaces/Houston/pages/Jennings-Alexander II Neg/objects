What are the chances that the transformative dynamic towards clean energy is derailed again? 
AND

First, RD%26D and niche market support has unleashed a wave of scientiﬁc interest and technological creativity to explore clean-fuel and end-use alternatives in all scientiﬁcally advanced countries. The assumption that competitive backstop technologies for oil will be ready to be scaled up within the 10–20-year period is not only plausible but very likely.
Second, the institutional and policy support in favour of clean energy, while highly fragmented and imperfect, is creating vibrant industries with increasing competitive pressure for all technologies, and sustainability as an overarching core value. In brief, the trend to slowing oil demand growth appears irreversible in the absence of a ~’black swan event~’.

**• Therefore almost the entire finance industry has to be scrapped, and replaced by arrangements whereby money is made available, lent, invested etc., without increasing the wealth of the lender. That is incomprehensible to most current economists, politicians and ordinary people. **
**• Among related problems is how to provide for old age, when this can~’t be done via superannuation schemes relying on returns on invested savings?   **

Inside US-China Trade 12/5, 2012 HORMATS SAYS BIT TALKS WITH CHINA MAY NOT LEAD TO COMPREHENSIVE DEAL Lexis

Overall, Hormats reiterated the administration&amp;#39;s message that while it welcomes Chinese investment into the

its companies seeking to invest in the U.S., he said.


The US-China BIT solves the entire case and is critical to stabilize the global investment regime.

US concerns as a host country seem to become more pronounced, reflected in the

economies, but also for the evolution of the international investment law regime.

Iran Adv

No chance of leverage in Iran talks – Recent statements prove. 
Boston Herald 2/8/13 Stalemate on Iran http://bostonherald.com/news_opinion/opinion/editorials/2013/02/stalemate_iran

Vice President Joe Biden said last week that direct talks with Iran over its nuclear

go on, but anyone hoping for a breakthrough shouldn’t hold their breath.


Econ

China no longer fears protectionism as a result of US policy ~-~-- CFIUS is good because it forces Chinese corporations to build-up their regulatory experience and capability ~-~-- ultimately incentivizes reforms that liberalize the Chinese economy 
Daniel H. Rosen 12, partner at the Rhodium Group, and Thilo Hanemann research director at the Rhodium Group, “The Rise in Chinese Overseas Investment and What It Means for American Businesses,” China Business Review, July-September 2012, https://www.chinabusinessreview.com/public/1207/rosen.html
Initially, politicians in Washington and elsewhere were caught off guard by rising Chinese investment 
AND
wider opportunities for foreign multinationals in industries currently off-limits to them.

Gas

Ailun Yang 10-15, Senior Associate – World Resources Institute, “What Is The Future Of King Coal In China?” 10-15-12, http://insights.wri.org/news/2012/10/what-future-king-coal-china
China’s great thirst for coal is undeniably troubling from a sustainable development standpoint. However
AND
capacity is likely to be only half of what was installed last year.

Financial incentives must be directed at Production.
Financial incentives must be targeted at energy generation 
O’Brien, Minister of State, Department for Energy and Climate Change, UK Parliament, 11/18/’8
(Mike, “Clause 20 — Terms and conditions,” http://www.theyworkforyou.com/debate/?id=2008-11-18b.159.3)

I have quite a lot still to say, so I shall try to give 
AND
. What is proposed will be a real feed-in tariff scheme.
RandD isn’t tied to energy production—plan is an indirect incentive
EIA, Energy Information Administration, Office of Energy Markets and End Use, U.S. DOE, ‘92
(“Federal Energy Subsidies: Direct and Indirect Interventions in Energy Markets,” ftp://tonto.eia.doe.gov/service/emeu9202.pdf)

Research and development. The budgetary cost of Government-funded research and development (
AND
energy prices and costs, and so could be considered an indirect subsidy.

Violation: SMR’s incentivize RandD not energy production. 
Vote Neg—tons of bidirectional mechanisms impact energy tech in ways that could increase production—only direct financial disbursements for increased production create a predictable and manageable topic
EIA, Energy Information Administration, Office of Energy Markets and End Use, U.S. DOE, ‘92
(“Federal Energy Subsidies: Direct and Indirect Interventions in Energy Markets,” ftp://tonto.eia.doe.gov/service/emeu9202.pdf)

In some sense, most Federal policies have the potential to affect energy markets. 
AND
through financial incentives, regulation, public enterprise, or research and development.

Politics

Immigration reform is moving through the Senate but the specifics still need to be negotiated – Obama’s political capital is key

CBS News 1/28/13 “Key senators agree on sweeping immigration reform” http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250_162-57566097/key-senators-agree-on-sweeping-immigration-reform/

A bipartisan group of leading senators has reached agreement on the principles of sweeping legislation 
AND
supporting immigration reform with a path to citizenship has become a political imperative.


The plan uniquely disrupts Obama’s ability to pass immigration reform – energy policy derails compromises and its being avoided now.

He has been a cleantech private equity investor since 2004, and acts or has served as a Director, Observer and advisory board member to multiple companies in the energy tech and related sectors, currently including Digital Lumens, Next Step Living, and Powerit Solutions. “Cleantech Investing: 2013 Predictions” http://www.greentechmedia.com/cleantech-investing/post/cleantech-investing-2013-predictions 

I plan to write up some observations soon from a couple of trips I made 
AND
the White House and Congress horse-trade in favor of higher priorities.



 Immigration reform is necessary to revive the economy. 
Ezra Klein 1/31/13 Worried about the economy? Then pass immigration reform  http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/01/31/worried-about-the-economy-then-pass-immigration-reform/
Washington tends to have a narrow view of what counts as “economic policy.”

business owners. Immigration reform is a way to get more of both.

None of which means that we can just sit back and enjoy the recession. 
AND
the world economy back on track, we may still have to fight. 

Renewables
Renewables are competitive now
Tickell, 8/20/12 – British journalist, author and campaigner on health and environment issues, and author of the Kyoto2 climate initiative (Oliver, “Does the world need nuclear power to solve the climate crisis?” http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/aug/20/world-need-nuclear-power-climate-crisis)

However, non-hydro renewables are growing very fast – up 15% in 
AND
dangers and long- term liabilities. It is both romantic and right.

Investment in nuclear power would keep funds away from renewable energy – empirically proven – this means warming
NIRS 2k, “Keep Nuclear Power From Receiving More Subsidies at the Expense of Sustainable Energy and Energy Efficiency,” Nuclear Information and Resource Service, 2000, http://www.nirs.org/climate/background/cdmnukesnirsbackground.htm, accessed 8-12-2012.
Further investment in nuclear would also keep funds away from renewable energy development. This 
AND
greenhouse gas reduction benefit we receive, while we hurt sustainable technology investment. 

Renewables solve extinction
Wood 10 (Duncan, Director – Program in International Relations and Canadian Studies Program – Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México, “Environment, Development and Growth: U.S.-Mexico Cooperation in Renewable Energies,” Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars – Mexico Institute, May, http://www.wilsoncenter.org/topics/pubs/U.S.%20Mexico%20Cooperation%20in%20Renewable%20Energies.pdf)
It is by now common knowledge that the world is facing a climate change crisis 
AND
alternative sources of energy is a crucial component of climate change mitigation strategies.

“Small reactors” creates a metaphor similar to children’s toys – that’s bad because it shuts down discussion about safety and implementation.

We don’t know all the answers yet, but we should avoid being drawn in

political, and organizational contexts in which these machines will ultimately be used.
This attempt to minimize risks means that we won’t be able to deliberate about nuclear power in general. Turns the case.
