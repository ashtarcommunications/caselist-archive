==1AC – Inh==

====Contention One – Inherency – ====

====Last month, the Obama administration arbitrarily blocked Chinese ownership of renewable energy companies. This restriction on energy production deters investment and damages US-China relations.====

**Xinhua 9/30/12** The alarm bell of US protectionism rings loud - China.org.cn http://www.china.org.cn/business/2012-09/30/content_26681566.htm
A recent decision by U.S. President Barack Obama to block a Chinese
AND
a disturbing message to other foreign investors, no less the Chinese ones.



====And, the rejection is a protectionist weapon that sets a precedent against foreign investment in energy.====
**Wall Street Journal 10-15** 2012: 13. Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Wind Farm; Did Obama abuse a security process to kill a Chinese investment for political reasons? Proquest

Enter the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or Cfius. Since 
AND
evidence to market its products to Pacific-Northwest wind-farm operators.


==Econ==

====Contention Two – Advantages – ====

**====Advantage one is the Economy====**

**====First, Obama~’s rejection of Chinese wind development signals protectionism and discourages foreign investment in American energy.====**
Nick **Juliano and** John **McArdle, 10/2/12** E%26E reporters  Obama~’s blocking of wind farm adds to U.S.-China tension
Posted: Tuesday, October 2, 2012 http://www.governorswindenergycoalition.org/?p=3480-http://www.governorswindenergycoalition.org/?p=3480

The Treasury Department said last week that blocking the Oregan project was done to protect 
AND
economy still struggling to create jobs, that~’s the wrong signal to send.&amp;#34;



====And, now is critical - the brink for an all-out trade war is now .====

Stephen Roach, former Chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia and current Yale professor, warns 
AND
the Great Crisis, there is no shortage of itchy fingers in Washington.&amp;#34;



**====The impact is war with China - Trade wars escalate – collapsing the global economy, creating widespread protectionism and becoming a shooting war.====**
**Wang and Li 11 **(Jianhua and Yunlu—Xinhua news agency, citing Ni Feng, Vice President of the Institute of American Studies underthe Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, Zhao Jinping, vice director of the Foreign Economic Department of the Development Research Center (DRC) of the State Council &amp;#34;China-US trade war no good for anyone&amp;#34;, October 13, 2011. http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90780/7616581.html 

A trade war between the United States and China, each of which is the 
AND
and will even lead to political and military confrontations in some sensitive regions. 

====And, Conflict with China will escalate to global nuclear war====
Lee Hunkovic (Professor of Political Science at the American Military University) 2009 &amp;#34;The Chinese-Taiwanese Conflict: Possible Futures of a Confrontation between China, Taiwan and the United States of America&amp;#34;, http://www.lamp-method.org/eCommons/ Hunkovic.pdf-http://www.lamp-method.org/eCommons/Hunkovic.pdf)
A war between China, Taiwan and the United States has the potential to escalate 
AND
outcome, therefore, other countries will not be considered in this study.


====Further, rejection of foreign investment in this case sets a terrible precedent and creates widespread protectionism. ====

Continuing calls for curbs on the flow of finance and trade will inspire the United 
AND
between Muslims and Western societies as the beginnings of a new world war.






==Global Warming==

====Advantage 2 – is Global Warming====

====First, The restriction on Chinese renewable development singles out China and destroys relations.====
Edward **Alden 10/2/12** Council on Foreign Relations The Changing Politics of Chinese Trade and Investment http://blogs.cfr.org/renewing-america/2012/10/02/the-changing-politics-of-chinese-trade-and-investment/-http://blogs.cfr.org/renewing-america/2012/10/02/the-changing-politics-of-chinese-trade-and-investment/

On the same day last week that President Obama was issuing an order blocking a 
AND
getting harder – is to figure out whether both can be done simultaneously.



====Only US-China cooperation and investment solves.====

China and the United States, the world~’s dominant producers of carbon emissions, have 
AND
all of these technologies, they cannot achieve separately what they could jointly.

====And, the restriction irritates already fragile China-US tensions.====
**CS Monitor 10/3/12** Obama blocks Chinese wind farm ownership in Oregon 

The decision marks the first time in more than 22 years that an American president 
AND
Treasury Department statement attempted to play down the political gravity of the decision.

====Restricting energy development on the basis that foreign investment is a threat to national security sends the signal that the US energy market is off limit and stifles US-China energy cooperation====
Claudia **Mahn 10/1/12** Global Insight October 1, 2012 President Obama blocks Chinese wind farm ambitions Lexis

However, in a statement on Friday, the Department of Treasury said the president~’s 
AND
terminals currently under regulatory review (seeUnited States: 22 August 2012:) .

====Cooperation on energy spills over and solves broader US-China relations====
**Cronin 8/27 (**2012, Dr. Patrick M. Cronin is Senior Advisor and Senior Director of the Asia-Pacific Security Program at the Center for a New American Security in Washington, D.C.  He is also the editor and co-author of Cooperation from Strength: The United States, China and the South China, &amp;#34;Averting Conflict in the South China Sea,&amp;#34; http://www.chinausfocus.com/foreign-policy/averting-conflict-in-the-south-china-sea/) 
Geostrategic and globalization interests will both persist, forcing an uncomfortable mixture of competition and cooperation.

Cooperative schemes have foundered on distrust, and can be viewed cynically as seeking to 
AND
the South China Sea will only be harnessed when there is such cooperation. 

====Cooperative Clean-energy investment is critical to green-tech diffusion and solving climate change.====

Second, there are also major long-term global benefits from clean energy cooperation 
AND
planet~’s resources and safeguard future generations from the damaging effects of climate change.

====Only US-China cooperation and investment solves.====

China and the United States, the world~’s dominant producers of carbon emissions, have 
AND
all of these technologies, they cannot achieve separately what they could jointly.

====Warming results in extinction====
**Ahmed 2010** (Nafeez Ahmed, Executive Director of the Institute for Policy Research and Development, professor of International Relations and globalization at Brunel University and the University of Sussex, Spring/Summer 2010, &amp;#34;Globalizing Insecurity: The Convergence of Interdependent Ecological, Energy, and Economic Crises,&amp;#34; Spotlight on Security, Volume 5, Issue 2, online)
Perhaps the most notorious indicator is anthropogenic global warmings warming. The landmark 2007 Fourth

====No adaption to worst case – the impact is extinction====
**Tickell 8** (Oliver, Environmental Researcher, The Guardian, August 11, http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/aug/11/climatechange-http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/aug/11/climatechange, JMB, accessed 6-23-11)
We need to get prepared for four degrees of global warming, Bob Watson told 
AND
the warming caused by human emissions could propel us towards a similar hothouse Earth

====Scientific consensus on anthropogenic warming ====
**Anderegg et al 10 **~~William, Professor of Biology at Stanford University; James W. Prall, Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto; Jacob Harold, William and Flora Hewlett Foundation; Stephen H. Schneider, Professor of Biology at Stanford University, Senior Fellow at the Woods Institute for the Environment, &amp;#34;Expert credibility in climate change,&amp;#34; 5-9, PNAS, vol 107, no 27, http://www.pnas.org/content/107/27/12107.full.pdf+html~~
Preliminary reviews of scientiﬁc literature and surveys of climate scientists indicate striking agreement with the 
AND
discussions in media, policy, and public forums regarding anthropogenic climate change.


==Plan==

====Thus, we present the following plan:====

====Plan – The United States federal government should limit the review of foreign investment in wind power by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States to cases in which national security, not economic competition is a factor.====

==Solvency==

====Contention 3 is Solvency - ====

====Reversal of the CFIUS decision on wind energy is critical to send a signal that the US is open to investment. ====
**Vigdor, Elwood %26 Marwell 10/22/12** Billy Vigdor and John Elwood are partners, and Jeremy Marwell is an associate at Vinson %26 Elkins~’ Washington, D.C., office. &amp;#34;Blocking Ore. Wind Farms: Overstepping Authority?&amp;#34; http://www.velaw.com/uploadedFiles/VEsite/Resources/BlockingOreWindFarmsOversteppingAuthority.pdf
CFIUS practitioners and the business community should watch this case closely. The plaintiffs will 
AND
for interested parties to express their views through amicus filings with the court.

====Further, only explicitly removing economic competition from the scope of investment review solves.====
David M. **Marchick %26** Matthew J. **Slaughter 2008** The Bernard and Irene Schwartz Series on American Competitiveness Global FDI Policy Correcting a Protectionist Drift CSR NO. 34, JUNE 2008 COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS

Principle 1: The investment review law should be narrowly tailored and focused on national 
AND
investment in transactions that do not raise national security or other governmental interests.

====And, Chinese clean energy investment is critical to job creation in the US. ====

China~’s smart green energy investment http://www.climatespectator.com.au/commentary/china-s-smart-green-energy-investment

Critics argue that Chinese investment in US clean energy leads to theft of American jobs 
AND
jobs go wherever the technology is deployed, not where it is manufactured.

====And, The broad interpretation of national security fails – creates economic uncertainty, protectionism and hampers US foreign policy goals.====
**Carroll-Emory International Law Review-09** (Jamie FF, COMMENT: BACK TO THE FUTURE: REDEFINING THE FOREIGN INVESTMENT AND NATIONAL SECURITY ACT~’S CONCEPTION OF NATIONAL SECURITY, 23 Emory Int~’l L. Rev. 167)

The broad and vague interpretation of national security by the CFIUS creates four distinct problems
AND
foreign policy goals, just when such cooperation is essential to global peace.

====Finally, Only a narrow wind-energy specific Limit to national security solves, the plan creates clarity and predictability. ====
David **Marchick 2008** Sovereign Wealth Funds And National Security OECD/City of London ConferenceMarch 31, 2008 www.oecd.org/investment/investmentpolicy/40395077.pdf
How Should National Security Review Mechanisms be Structured? ➢ Narrowly tailored ▪ The investment
AND
requiring investment reviews, the lists should be drafted as narrowly as possible. 

====Only the plan solves – courts can~’t review the decision and only limiting the scope of review for CFIUS solves. ====

So what happens next? If Ralls goes ahead with a lawsuit, it will 
AND
deals, such as Nexen, will be somehow influenced by this case.
