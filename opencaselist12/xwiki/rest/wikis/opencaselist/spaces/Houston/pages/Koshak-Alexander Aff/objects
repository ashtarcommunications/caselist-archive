=THE FRACKING AFF=

==C1- Inherency ==

====Hydraulic Fracturing is the main type of fracturing used by gas companies in the US====

Goldman 11

Goldman, Michael. &amp;#34;Drilling into Hydraulic Fracturing and Shale Gas Development: A Texas Environmental Perspective&amp;#34; ALI-ABA October 18, 2011. 

Hydraulic fracturing is used by gas producers to stimulate wells and recover natural gas from 
AND
about potential impacts on drinking water resources, public health, and the environment



====Regulators need to promote alternative forms of fracking to offset costs and wastes ====

Rozell 12

Rozell, Daniel J. and Reaven, Sheldon J. &amp;#34;Water Pollution Risk Associated with Natural Gas Extraction from the Marcellus Shale&amp;#34; Risk Analysis, Vol. 32, No. 8, 2012. 

Regulators have recently moved to control the surface disposal of hydraulic fracturing wastewater more stringently
AND
CO2,(67) and even liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).(68)


====Creates massive delays for conventional fracking. ====

**Platts 12** Proposed BLM fracking rule has no scientific basis: IECA Houston (Platts)—18Jun2012 http://www.platts.com/RSSFeedDetailedNews/RSSFeed/NaturalGas/6394906
Cicio told Platts that he worried that the imposition of additional regulations on the production 
AND
states have voiced their objections to the proposed new federal regulation of fracking.


==Plan Text: The United States federal government should exempt Carbon Dioxide Fracturing from restrictions promulgated under Regulation Identifier Number 1004-AE26.==

==Advantage 1- Hydraulic Fracking==


====Hydraulic fracking pollutes groundwater and destroy the ecosystem====
**Bishop 11** (&amp;#34;Chemical and Biological Risk Assessment for Natural Gas Extraction in New York&amp;#34; Ronald E. Bishop, Ph.D., CHO Chemistry %26 Biochemistry Department State University of New York, College at Oneonta March 28, 2011, http://www.sustainableotsego.org/Risk%20Assessment%20Natural%20Gas%20Extraction-1.htm)

Over the last decade, operators in the natural gas industry have developed highly sophisticated 
AND
the objective is to evaluate risk related to the industry as a whole.

====This kills the ecosystem through methane leaks and groundwater contamination====
**Bishop 11** (&amp;#34;Chemical and Biological Risk Assessment for Natural Gas Extraction in New York&amp;#34; Ronald E. Bishop, Ph.D., CHO Chemistry %26 Biochemistry Department State University of New York, College at Oneonta March 28, 2011, http://www.sustainableotsego.org/Risk%20Assessment%20Natural%20Gas%20Extraction-1.htm)

As stated above, the working hypothesis for this risk assessment is that future impacts 
AND
GWPC maintains lower standards for public safety and health than these other evaluators.

====Ecosystem decline and species loss risk extinction====
**Warner 94** (Paul Warner, American University, Dept of International Politics and Foreign Policy, August, Politics and Life Sciences, 1994, p 177)

Massive extinction of species is dangerous, then, because one cannot predict which species 
AND
is like playing Russian roulette, with our collective future as the stakes.



==Advantage 2- Economy==

===Scenario 1 is competitveness===

====Natural gas boosts industry and competitiveness—key to the econ====
Jasinowski 12
 (Jerry, National Association of Manufacturers president for 14 years, &amp;#34;Natural Gas — True Game Changer,&amp;#34; Huffington Post, 4-18-12, www.huffingtonpost.com/jerry-jasinowski/natural-gas-true-game-cha_b_1433933.html?utm_source=feedburner%26utm_medium=feed%26utm_campaign=Feed%3A+HP%2FBusiness+%28Business+on+The+Huffington+Post%29, accessed 5-28-12, mss)

The precipitous decline of natural gas prices — to less than %242 per 1
AND
gas in our country will boost economic growth for many years to come.


====US crisis tanks the global economy====
**RAHMAN ~’11** - former Ambassador and Chairman of the Centre for Foreign Affairs Studies. (Ashfaqur . &amp;#34;Another global recession?&amp;#34;. August 21. http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=199461)

Several developments, especially in Europe and the US, fan this fear. First
AND
we may be in a new double dip or W-shaped recession. 



====Economic collapse causes nuclear war====
Merlini 11
~~Cesare Merlini, nonresident senior fellow at the Center on the United States and 
AND
World?~’, Survival, 53:2, 117 – 130~~
Two neatly opposed scenarios for the future of the world order illustrate the range of 
AND
theocratic absolutes, competing or converging with secular absolutes such as unbridled nationalism.

===Scenario 2 is the US Dollar===

====Natural gas development lets the U.S. close the trade deficit and strengthen the dollar====
Holland 12
 ~~Kelley Holland, Currency Blogger at CNBC, &amp;#34;How Natural Gas Helps the Dollar&amp;#34;, Money in Motion, CNBC, 4-4-2012, http://www.cnbc.com/id/46955130-http://www.cnbc.com/id/46955130~~ 
The dollar stands to gain from exports of petroleum products, these strategists say. 
AND
be part of a broader improvement in the fundamental backdrop for the USD.&amp;#34;


====Strong U.S. dollar is critical to U.S. growth====
Drabier 11
**~~John, visiting professor of finance, Strong dollar is good for the U.S. economy, San Antonio Business Journal, 12-23-2011, http://www.bizjournals.com/sanantonio/print-edition/2011/12/23/strong-dollar-is-good-for-the-us.html?page=all~~**
Strange as it may seem, conventional economics 101 may not currently work for the 
AND
new U.S. jobs if the regulatory environment uncertainty is reduced.
Second, since its arrival, the Euro has served as an alternative to the 
AND
. Reduced input prices lead to increased output demand, jobs and income.



==Advantage 3- Warming ==

====Warming is real and anthropogenic - Prefer scientific consensus to their hack deniers====

Lewandowsky and Ashley ~’11 (Stephan Lewandowsky, Professor of Cognitive Studies at the University of Western Australia, and Michael Ashley, Professor of Astrophysics at the University of New South Wales, June 24, 2011, &amp;#34;The false, the confused and the mendacious: how the media gets it wrong on climate change,&amp;#34; http://goo.gl/u3nOC)

But despite these complexities, some aspects of climate science are thoroughly settled. We 
AND
the 19th century, pre-dating even Sherlock Holmes and Queen Victoria.

====Renewables key to solve warming long-term but bridge tech is key in the interim====

**Nordhaus and Shellenberger ~’12** (Ted Nordhaus, energy analyst and chairman of the Breakthrough Institute, and Michael Shellenberger, energy analyst, author and president of the Breakthrough Institute, February 27, 2012, &amp;#34;Beyond Cap and Trade, A New Path to Clean Energy,&amp;#34; Yale Environment 360, http://goo.gl/dtQf4)

A funny thing happened while environmentalists were trying and failing to cap carbon emissions in 
AND
fossil fuels. There simply is no substitute for making clean energy cheap. 

====Fracking solves- Low gas prices spur the transition to natural gas====

**Worstall ~’12** (Tim Worstall, Fellow at the Adam Smith Institute in London, May 5, 2012, &amp;#34;Why Shale Gas is Closing Coal Plants: So Why Do the Hippies Hate Shale?,&amp;#34; Forbes, http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2012/05/05/why-shale-gas-is-closing-coal-plants-so-why-do-the-hippies-hate-shale/)

The shale gas revolution is doing a lot more than just making renewables seem more 
AND
losses in both cases but gas seems to have lower such as well.

====CO2 Fracking solves global warming and aids the environment====

Fracturing with carbon dioxide is a method patented in the early 80~’s (Bullen and 
AND
the former Soviet Union in late eighties (Luk and Grisdale, 1994).


====US environmental leadership is key to creating global action====
**Ivanova and Esty, 2008**

We contend, moreover, that not only is U.S. participation critical
AND
impact is significant.&amp;#34;4 Little progress is made without the United States. 

====Worst-case warming results in extinction====
**Ahmed 2010** (Nafeez Ahmed, Executive Director of the Institute for Policy Research and Development, professor of International Relations and globalization at Brunel University and the University of Sussex, Spring/Summer 2010, &amp;#34;Globalizing Insecurity: The Convergence of Interdependent Ecological, Energy, and Economic Crises,&amp;#34; Spotlight on Security, Volume 5, Issue 2, online)

We need to get prepared for four degrees of global warming, Bob Watson told 
AND
the warming caused by human emissions could propel us towards a similar hothouse Earth 

====Increased CO2 causes ocean acidification====
**Venkataramanan and smitha ~’11**(Department of Economics, D.G. Vaishnav College, Chennai, India Indian Journal of Science &amp;#34;Causes and effects of global warming p.226-229 March 2011 http://www.indjst.org/archive/vol.4.issue.3/mar11-pages159-265.pdf-http://www.indjst.org/archive/vol.4.issue.3/mar11-pages159-265.pdf)

The world~’s oceans may be turning acidic faster today from human carbon emissions than they 
AND

==Advantage 4- Russia ==


====Higher U.S. gas production solves Russian energy imperialism—gives alternatives to Europe====
Baker Institute 11
** ~~James A. Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice University, &amp;#34;Shale Gas and U.S. National Security&amp;#34;, Report ~~%2349, 10-2011, **http://www.bakerinstitute.org/publications/EF-pub-PolicyReport49.pdf-http://www.bakerinstitute.org/publications/EF-pub-PolicyReport49.pdf~~
The dramatic lessening of Europe~’s dependence on Russian gas will likely have considerable geopolitical implications 
AND
and other international initiatives that might not have the full support of Russia.

====Russian imperialism makes war with the U.S. inevitable====
Blank ~’7 (Stephen Blank , Research Professor of National Security Affairs at the Strategic Studies Institute of the U.S. Army War College, &amp;#34;Russian Democracy, Revisited&amp;#34; Spring, http://www.securityaffairs.org/issues/2007/12/blank.php-http://www.securityaffairs.org/issues/2007/12/blank.php) Bankey
Gvosdev defends his brand of realism as a moral policy based on prudential calculations that 
AND
very well succumb to imperial temptation, at the cost of international catastrophe.


====Escalates to global nuclear war====
Yesin 2007 (Colonel General Vladimir Senior Vice President of the Russian Academy of the Problems of Security, Defense, and Law. &amp;#34;Will America Fight Russia?;&amp;#34;. Defense and Security, No 78. LN  July 2007)
Yesin: Should the Russian-American war begin, it will inevitably deteriorate into the Third World War. The United States is a NATO member and this bloc believes in collective security. In fact, collective security is what it is about.  Vladimirov: This war will inevitably deteriorate into a nuclear conflict. Regardless of what weapons will be used in the first phase.

====Shift to gas from coal now- solves climate====
Mead, 12 — Bard College James Clarke Chace Professor of Foreign Affairs and Humanities 
(Walter Russell,  American Interest editor-at-large, &amp;#34;Frack to Save the Planet?,&amp;#34;5-24-12,  Via Meadia, blogs.the-american-interest.com/wrm/2012/05/24/frack-to-save-the-planet/, accessed 5-28-12, mss)

Birol et al. 12
(Fatih, &amp;#34;Golden Rules for a Golden Age of Gas,&amp;#34; IEA report designed and directed by Fatih Birol, 2012, www.worldenergyoutlook.org/media/weowebsite/2012/goldenrules/WEO2012_GoldenRulesReport.pdf, accessed 6-2-12, mss)
One advantage attributable to expanded unconventional gas production and use over production and use of conventional gas is the distance to market; in general, unconventional resources are developed closer to the point of consumption, thereby reducing the distance required for transportation. All else being equal, this tends to reduce the level of fugitive emissions, as well as CO2 emissions from the energy used for transportation.


====Increased natural gas production is the only way to sustainably transition to a renewable-fueled future====

**Sutherland ~’11** (Timothy F. Sutherland, Pace Global Energy Services, March 17, 2011, &amp;#34;Building a Clean and Reliable Energy Future: Natural Gas and Renewable Energy,&amp;#34; National Geographic, http://goo.gl/UYSGS)

====Warming is real and anthropogenic- Overwhelming consensus concludes aff====

Rahmstorf ~’08 **(Richard Rahmstorf, physics professor at Potsdam University, &amp;#34;Anthropogenic Climate Change?&amp;#34; Page 42-49)**

It is time to turn to statement B: human activities are altering the climate
AND
that anthropogenic global warming is a reality with which we need to deal.



====Warming~’s the only existential threat====
Deibel ~’07 – Professor of IR at the National War College (Terry, &amp;#34;Foreign Affairs Strategy: Logic for American Statecraft,&amp;#34; 2007, Conclusion: American Foreign Affairs Strategy Today)

Finally, there is one major existential threat to American security (as well as 
AND
States, but potentially to the continued existence of life on this planet.  



====Extinction====

**Brandenburg and Paxson ~’99** (John Brandenburg, PhD, physicist and professor, and Monica Rix Paxson, distinguished science writer, &amp;#34;Dead Mars, Dying Earth&amp;#34;, google books)

One can imagine a scenario for global catastrophe that runs similarly. If the human

==A2 Econ Defense==


====Global economic crisis causes war—strong statistical support—also causes great power transitions====

Royal ~’10 (Jedediah Royal, Director of Cooperative Threat Reduction at the U.S. Department of Defense, 2010, &amp;#34;Economic Integration, Economic Signaling and the Problem of Economic Crises,&amp;#34; in Economics of War and Peace: Economic, Legal and Political Perspectives, ed.

==A2 Contamination==

====Fracking doesn~’t cause contamination – major study====
**BBC 12** (June 28, ~’Fracking~’ safe with strong regulation, report says http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-18611647)

The controversial oil and gas extraction process known as hydraulic fracturing, or &amp;#34;fracking&amp;#34;, is capable of being managed sustainably and without serious risk of groundwater contamination or inducing damaging earthquakes, the Royal Society has found. One of the world~’s most respected independent scientific bodies, the society worked with the Royal Academy of Engineering to produce a report sought by the UK~’s chief scientific adviser, John Beddington.

====Fracking doesn~’t cause increased cancer rates or radioactive water – opponents~’ claims are just hype====
**AP 12** (July 23^^rd^^, &amp;#34;Experts: Some fracking critics use bad science&amp;#34; http://www.rdmag.com/News/2012/07/Energy-Natural-Gas-Regulations-Experts-Some-fracking-critics-use-bad-science/)

PITTSBURGH (AP)—In the debate over natural gas drilling, the companies are

====Unconventional gas will grow====
**Moniz et al 12**
**~~Main Chair on the Study, &amp;#34;The Future of Natural Gas&amp;#34;, multidisciplinary MIT Study, 2012~~**
In a global context, U.S. gas production by type is extremely

====Trends are up====
**Moniz et al 12**
**~~Main Chair on the Study, &amp;#34;The Future of Natural Gas&amp;#34;, multidisciplinary MIT Study, 2012~~**
Unconventional natural gas, and particularly shale gas, will make an important contribution to future U.S. energy supply and CO2 emission reduction efforts. Assessments of the recoverable volumes of shale gas in the U.S. have increased dramatically over the last ﬁve years, and continue to grow. The mean projection of 
the recoverable shale gas resource in this report is approximately 650 Tcf, with low

====Supplies will accelerate====
**Moniz et al 12**
**~~Main Chair on the Study, &amp;#34;The Future of Natural Gas&amp;#34;, multidisciplinary MIT Study, 2012~~**
Despite the relative maturity of the U.S. gas supply, estimates of 
AND
420 to 870 Tcf. This resource growth is a testament to the power 
of technology application in the development of resources, and also provides an illustration of the large uncertainty inherent in all resource estimates. 



==A2 Well Productivity Down==


====Tech has improved productivity—and will increase====
**Moniz et al 12**

Over the course of the era of state energy policy innovation, states have selected 
AND
and what are the limits of state leadership in energy and climate policy.

Specifically, 50 state uniformity on energy doesn~’t exist because each state is radically different- either our theory args are true or the CP causes chaos that rolls back solvency
Carlson ~’08 ~~Ann, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) - School of Law, &amp;#34;Iterative Federalism and Climate Change,&amp;#34; online~~

One of the lessons of iterative federalism is that policymakers and scholars need not view 
AND
government. In short, iterative federalism ought to expand our regulatory horizons.
More evidence- there~’s no good comparative research base on uniform state policies

There are three critical gaps in the existing literature that motivates our research. First

All 50 states can~’t legally take the same action- each is distinct, their form of fiat isn~’t real-world
Carlson ~’08 ~~Ann, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) - School of Law, &amp;#34;Iterative Federalism and Climate Change,&amp;#34; online~~

Finally, there is insufficient recognition at the federal level of the key role that

new set of policy and funding partnerships with the state programs and funds.
State and federal cooperation solves best
CESA ~’10 ~~Clean Energy States Alliance (CESA) is a national nonprofit organization of public clean energy funds and programs that have banded together to invest in and promote clean energy and low-carbon technologies in their states and, collectively, across the country, &amp;#34;States Lead the Clean Energy Revolution,&amp;#34; http://www.cleanenergystates.org/assets/Uploads/Resources-post-8-16/CESA-2010-Members-Report.pdf-http://www.cleanenergystates.org/assets/Uploads/Resources-post-8-16/CESA-2010-Members-Report.pdf~~
In CESA~’s view, a state/federal partnership on a national energy program is

Federal guidance is key to effective state action- otherwise the CP fails
Carlson ~’08 ~~Ann, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) - School of Law, &amp;#34;Iterative Federalism and Climate Change,&amp;#34; online~~

A clarification is in order. In identifying and analyzing examples of iterative federalism, 
AND

===Perm- Solves F~’ism===
Perm to do both solves the federalism net benefit- adaptive forms are best

Engel, (Professor at University of Arizona Law School in the areas of environmental law and economics and the environmental) 2008, Adaptive Federalism: The Case Against Reallocating Environmental Regulatory Authority http://www.minnesotalawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/AdelmanEngel_FinalPDF.pdf-http://www.minnesotalawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/AdelmanEngel_FinalPDF.pdf

Our adaptive model provides a powerful framework for a dynamic conception of federalism premised on 
AND
of the matching principle ought to be reconsidered, if not abandoned altogether. 


===1AR- No funding===
No money for the CP

The most obvious problems arise at the fiscal front. The national government is effectively 
AND
Europeans; but then, we haven~’t explained it to ourselves, either.


===Federal pre-emption===
Federal pre-emption is likely
World Resources Institute ~’08 ~~&amp;#34;State and Federal Policy Roles,&amp;#34; August, http://pdf.wri.org/bottom_line_state_fed.pdf~~

States currently have the authority to regulate GHG emissions. This could change depending on 
AND
implementing policies that reduce GHGs from sources not regulated by the federal government.


===States fail- General===
CP causes follow-the-leader policies that are ineffective and lack oversight

Shobe, Director, Center for Economic and Policy Studies Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service Professor of Public Policy, Frank Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy, Dallas Burtraw, PhD in Economics from University of Michigan, Senior Fellow at Resources for the Future, &amp;#34;Rethinking Environmental Federalism in a Warming World,&amp;#34; http://www.rff.org/rff/Documents/RFF-DP-12-04.pdf-http://www.rff.org/rff/Documents/RFF-DP-12-04.pdf~~

Follow-the-leader policy development occurs frequently, where one state or a

goal and, if so, whether it has been worth the cost.
Multiple drawbacks to state energy policy

Disadvantages of the State Model • States are often challenged in their ability to hire 
AND
clean energy or efficiency, or that are in contradiction with CEF objectives.
Inconsistent standards among states mean the CP fails
Shobe and Burtraw ~’12 ~~William M. Shobe, Director, Center for Economic and Policy Studies Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service Professor of Public Policy, Frank Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy, Dallas Burtraw, PhD in Economics from University of Michigan, Senior Fellow at Resources for the Future, &amp;#34;Rethinking Environmental Federalism in a Warming World,&amp;#34; http://www.rff.org/rff/Documents/RFF-DP-12-04.pdf-http://www.rff.org/rff/Documents/RFF-DP-12-04.pdf~~

Moreover, differences in the stringency of climate initiatives across jurisdictions inherently produce different marginal costs of emissions reductions, undermining the costeffectiveness and the fairness of policy. In contrast, a national standard or rule may enforce ethical imperatives through national-level nondiscrimination, despite opposition by some localities or individuals.

===Feds key- Warming===
Federal action is key to solve warming- CP can~’t solve international cooperation
Shobe and Burtraw ~’12 ~~William M. Shobe, Director, Center for Economic and Policy Studies Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service Professor of Public Policy, Frank Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy, Dallas Burtraw, PhD in Economics from University of Michigan, Senior Fellow at Resources for the Future, &amp;#34;Rethinking Environmental Federalism in a Warming World,&amp;#34; http://www.rff.org/rff/Documents/RFF-DP-12-04.pdf-http://www.rff.org/rff/Documents/RFF-DP-12-04.pdf~~

There are very good reasons why, even in a federalist state, the national

A stronger dollar may hurt U.S. multinationals operating in global markets. Expensive U.S. exports may reduce U.S. employment. However, we argue that a stronger dollar will have minimal impact on U.S. exports and jobs. U.S. multinationals have established global subsidiaries in many countries. If input prices in one country, say, Taiwan, increase, U.S. multinationals seamlessly switch sourcing from Taiwan to other countries.

**Moniz et. al 12**
**~~Main Chair on the Study, &amp;#34;The Future of Natural Gas&amp;#34;, multidisciplinary MIT Study, 2012~~**
Greater international market liquidity would be beneﬁcial to U.S. interests. U
AND
,ONGER SUPPLY CHAINS INCREASE THE VULNER ability of the natural gas infrastructure.

U.S. hegemonic decline causes global great-power war
Zhang %26 Shi 11 – Yuhan Zhang, researcher at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace; Lin Shi, Columbia University, independent consultant for the Eurasia Group and consultant for the World Bank, January 22, 2011, &amp;#34;America~’s decline: A harbinger of conflict and rivalry,&amp;#34; East Asia Forum, online: http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2011/01/22/americas-decline-a-harbinger-of-conflict-and-rivalry/

Over the past two decades, no other state has had the ability to seriously challenge the US military. Under these circumstances, motivated by both opportunity and fear, many actors have bandwagoned with US hegemony and accepted a subordinate role. Canada, most of Western Europe, India, Japan, South Korea, Australia, Singapore and the Philippines have all joined the US, creating a status quo that has tended to mute great power conflicts.
However, as the hegemony that drew these powers together withers, so will the pulling power behind the US alliance. The result will be an international order where power is more diffuse, American interests and influence can be more readily challenged, and conflicts or wars may be harder to avoid.
As history attests, power decline and redistribution result in military confrontation. For example
AND
-creating Leviathan shaping the international system with democracy and rule of law.
Defining this US-centred system are three key characteristics: enforcement of property rights, constraints on the actions of powerful individuals and groups and some degree of equal opportunities for broad segments of society. As a result of such political stability, free markets, liberal trade and flexible financial mechanisms have appeared. And, with this, many countries have sought opportunities to enter this system, proliferating stable and cooperative relations.
However, what will happen to these advances as America~’s influence declines? Given that America~’s authority, although sullied at times, has benefited people across much of Latin America, Central and Eastern Europe, the Balkans, as well as parts of Africa and, quite extensively, Asia, the answer to this question could affect global society in a profoundly detrimental way.
Public imagination and academia have anticipated that a post-hegemonic world would return to the problems of the 1930s: regional blocs, trade conflicts and strategic rivalry. Furthermore, multilateral institutions such as the IMF, the World Bank or the WTO might give way to regional organisations.
For example, Europe and East Asia would each step forward to fill the vacuum left by Washington~’s withering leadership to pursue their own visions of regional political and economic orders. Free markets would become more politicised — and, well, less free — and major powers would compete for supremacy.
Additionally, such power plays have historically possessed a zero-sum element. In the late 1960s and 1970s, US economic power declined relative to the rise of the Japanese and Western European economies, with the US dollar also becoming less attractive. And, as American power eroded, so did international regimes (such as the Bretton Woods System in 1973).
A world without American hegemony is one where great power wars re-emerge, the liberal international system is supplanted by an authoritarian one, and trade protectionism devolves into restrictive, anti-globalisation barriers. This, at least, is one possibility we can forecast in a future that will inevitably be devoid of unrivalled US primacy.




===Hegemony/FP—Solvency—2AC===

One advantage attributable to expanded unconventional gas production and use over production and use of conventional gas is the distance to market; in general, unconventional resources are developed closer to the point of consumption, thereby reducing the distance required for transportation.

Sulfur dioxide additions are not a factor in our analysis because the substitute‐gas and low‐
carbon‐fast scenarios reduce the burning of coal over the growth period in an identical 
fashion.  Thus both introduce SO2 identically, and the small warming effects of the SO2, 
which will occur no matter how coal is retired, cancel in the comparison.

A stronger dollar may hurt U.S. multinationals operating in global markets. Expensive U.S. exports may reduce U.S. employment. However, we argue that a stronger dollar will have minimal impact on U.S. exports and jobs. U.S. multinationals have established global subsidiaries in many countries. If input prices in one country, say, Taiwan, increase, U.S. multinationals seamlessly switch sourcing from Taiwan to other countries.

U.S. hegemonic decline causes global great-power war
Zhang %26 Shi 11 – Yuhan Zhang, researcher at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace; Lin Shi, Columbia University, independent consultant for the Eurasia Group and consultant for the World Bank, January 22, 2011, &amp;#34;America~’s decline: A harbinger of conflict and rivalry,&amp;#34; East Asia Forum, online: http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2011/01/22/americas-decline-a-harbinger-of-conflict-and-rivalry/

Over the past two decades, no other state has had the ability to seriously challenge the US military. Under these circumstances, motivated by both opportunity and fear, many actors have bandwagoned with US hegemony and accepted a subordinate role. Canada, most of Western Europe, India, Japan, South Korea, Australia, Singapore and the Philippines have all joined the US, creating a status quo that has tended to mute great power conflicts.
However, as the hegemony that drew these powers together withers, so will the pulling power behind the US alliance. The result will be an international order where power is more diffuse, American interests and influence can be more readily challenged, and conflicts or wars may be harder to avoid.
As history attests, power decline and redistribution result in military confrontation. For example
AND
-creating Leviathan shaping the international system with democracy and rule of law.
Defining this US-centred system are three key characteristics: enforcement of property rights, constraints on the actions of powerful individuals and groups and some degree of equal opportunities for broad segments of society. As a result of such political stability, free markets, liberal trade and flexible financial mechanisms have appeared. And, with this, many countries have sought opportunities to enter this system, proliferating stable and cooperative relations.
However, what will happen to these advances as America~’s influence declines? Given that America~’s authority, although sullied at times, has benefited people across much of Latin America, Central and Eastern Europe, the Balkans, as well as parts of Africa and, quite extensively, Asia, the answer to this question could affect global society in a profoundly detrimental way.
Public imagination and academia have anticipated that a post-hegemonic world would return to the problems of the 1930s: regional blocs, trade conflicts and strategic rivalry. Furthermore, multilateral institutions such as the IMF, the World Bank or the WTO might give way to regional organisations.
For example, Europe and East Asia would each step forward to fill the vacuum left by Washington~’s withering leadership to pursue their own visions of regional political and economic orders. Free markets would become more politicised — and, well, less free — and major powers would compete for supremacy.
Additionally, such power plays have historically possessed a zero-sum element. In the late 1960s and 1970s, US economic power declined relative to the rise of the Japanese and Western European economies, with the US dollar also becoming less attractive. And, as American power eroded, so did international regimes (such as the Bretton Woods System in 1973).
A world without American hegemony is one where great power wars re-emerge, the liberal international system is supplanted by an authoritarian one, and trade protectionism devolves into restrictive, anti-globalisation barriers. This, at least, is one possibility we can forecast in a future that will inevitably be devoid of unrivalled US primacy.
