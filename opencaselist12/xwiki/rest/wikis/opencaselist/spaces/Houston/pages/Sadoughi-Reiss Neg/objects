==1NC – Topicality Production==


====1.Interpretation - Incentives must be intentionally designed to increase production====

**Anastos, 8** – RESEARCHER, CROSS GOVERNMENT RESEARCH, POLICY AND PRACTICE BRANCH, OFFICE OF THE CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER, MINISTRY OF LABOUR AND CITIZENS~’ SERVICES (Douglas, &amp;#34;DO INCENTIVES WORK? CITIZEN INVOLVEMENT IN ACTIVITIES THROUGH INCENTIVE PROGRAMS&amp;#34;, 6/18, http://www.cio.gov.bc.ca/local/cio/kis/pdfs/incentive_programs.pdf-http://www.cio.gov.bc.ca/local/cio/kis/pdfs/incentive_programs.pdf) WHAT ARE INCENTIVES? The term ―incentive,‖ in its modern usage, was conceived in early twentieth century American debates of socialist economics and behavioural psychology. In the original context of industrial relations, psychologists regarded incentives as tools of labour control used in behavioural engineering experiments. Socialist economists adopted the notion that incentives might take the place of profit as a motivator in a planned economy with common ownership, and thereby correct deficiencies of automatic market forces (Grant, 2002). Today, incentives are broadly understood in a range of fields and contexts as devices designed to make one choice more attractive than any other alternative. According to Grant (2002), an incentive is &amp;#34;an offer of something of value, sometimes with a cash equivalent and sometimes not, meant to influence the payoff structure of a utility calculation so as to alter a person~’s course of action&amp;#34;. (p. 111). Fundamentally, incentives seek to change the status quo by motivating an action that would not occur naturally or automatically. Though incentive programs often take the form of conditional rewards, commonly referred to as the &amp;#34;carrot and stick approach,&amp;#34; they differ from rewards in one important way. A reward or punishment, unlike an incentive or disincentive, is merited or deserved. Further, incentives are not synonymous with motivation, in the broad sense of the term, because they fail to account for action that is initiated by the individual or is understood as internally motivated (Grant, 2002). One final distinction, particularly in the corporate sense, is between the concepts of compensation and incentive. The former implies an equalization or redress of a balance, while an incentive is offered as a bonus to motivate one to produce beyond the usual expectation. Incentives, in other words, are intentionally designed to exceed an amount set by market forces. An incentive program is a trust-based arrangement between a provider and a consumer, something that Grant (2002) refers to as a negotiation made in the context of an authority relationship. Obreiter and Nimis (n.d.) comment on some of the common issues and patterns that arise in this relationship: • Roles: In general, the entity distributing the incentive acts as provider, while the recipient or consumer accepts the incentive with the condition of involvement of an activity. In such a situation, the incentive pattern imposes symmetrical roles. • Remuneration: Every incentive program introduces its own type of remuneration with the goal of directing actions. Again, the remuneration scheme is a two-way exchange, as recipients act based on the arrangements of the incentive program. • Trust: Trust and cooperation are essential components of an effective incentive program both for producers and for recipients. Recipients need to know that the program will continue to offer the incentive and producers need to know that participants in the program will follow through with their role in the program once they have received the incentive. • Scalability: Scalability refers to the number of agencies involved in the program as providers and the number of recipients collecting incentives. A large number of agencies involved in the program as providers may complicate implementation. • Implementation issues: A range of implementation issues arise when developing an incentive program. Many of these can be mitigated through attention to the above points.

, the Court views ~~**67~~ the exclusive function test as met.



====C. Topicality is a Voting Issue====


====Ground – the heart of this years topic are the debates over which type of energy is superior AND how the market will achieve that.  They skirt this debate by claiming they research nanotech and other crazy things that don~’t exist. ====

====Limits – there are THOUSANDS of potential restrictions and THOUSANDS of incentive programs – the only way to limit this topic for research is to ensure the negative has a link to energy based disads on SUPPLY not use.====

====Grammatical Precision – the resolution asks the US to reduce restrictions ON energy production – it does not say ITS restrictions meaning they must defend a DECREASE in total number of restrictions.====

====Extra Topicality – At best the affirmative increases the SUPPLY in addition to other elements – this proves the resolution alone is insufficient and provides them with additional solvency ground.====


====Only two types of current Solar Power – Photovoltaic and Solar Thermal====

**Washington 11** (Nikia, &amp;#34;Solar Technology Shatters the Old Glass City&amp;#34;, http://blogs.bgsu.edu/blackswampjournal/2011/08/02/solar-technology-shatters-the-old-glass-city/-http://blogs.bgsu.edu/blackswampjournal/2011/08/02/solar-technology-shatters-the-old-glass-city/) What is Solar Energy Solar power, as defined by the United States Environmental Protection Agency-http://www.epa.gov/region1/eco/energy/re_solar.html, is the energy received from the sun to create renewable energy. Two types of solar technologies currently exist in the market: photovoltaic, which collects energy from the sun to provide electricity, and concentrated solar energy (solar thermal), which magnifies the intensity of the sun to create heat. The solar thermal method uses the sun to warm an anti-freeze liquid in tubes called solar thermal collectors. The liquid is then transferred to a heating tank, commonly used for hot water and space heating. The photovoltaic method uses photovoltaic silicon cells, usually linked together to generate maximum power, to collect energy from the sun. A grid gathers the energy from the cells and then converts it to operational electricity.

ThorEnergy advocates using plutonium as the initial &amp;#34;seed&amp;#34; material (the fissile material

Thorium supporters are conspiratorial and distort the truth.

I had a reader email me recently asking why we don~’t feature thorium nuclear technology 
AND
every government that looks into the matter doesn~’t want cheap, safe energy?

Thorium reactor would give countries a rationale to continue enrichment and reprocessing — can~’t control how the technology is used
**FOE Australia**, **2012**, &amp;#34;Thorium and WMD proliferation risks,&amp;#34;  http://foe.org.au/anti-nuclear/issues/nfc/power-weapons/thorium
Thorium fuel cycles are promoted on the grounds that they pose less of a proliferation

Claims of proliferation resistance are false—thorium reactors produce U-233 which can be used for nukes – trust the IAEA not industry hacks.

The absence of plutonium is in the thorium fuel cycle is claimed to reduce the

in place for the thorium fuel cycle and there is no overall benefit.


 Threat of international response deters nuclear terror

The threat of military, political, and economic repercussions from foreign actors provides another

a long history of economic sanctions, partly because of its nuclear program.



No domino theory—nonproliferation has zero utility

Hymans is keenly aware of the deficiency of past proliferation projections, which he attributes

Experts say the risk of a meltdown is nil – no extinction.

Forty-two years have passed since the first nuclear power plant went online in

not proven to be very serious and apparently are nothing worth worrying about.
