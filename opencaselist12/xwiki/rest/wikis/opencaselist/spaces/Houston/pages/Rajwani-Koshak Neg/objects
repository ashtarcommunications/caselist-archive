Today, economic and fiscal trends pose the most severe long-term threat to the United States~’ position as global leader. While the United States suffers from fiscal imbalances and low economic growth, the economies of rival powers are developing rapidly. The continuation of these two trends could lead to a shift from American primacy toward a multi-polar global system, leading in turn to increased geopolitical rivalry and even war among the great powers.
The current recession is the result of a deep financial crisis, not a mere 
AND
debt  rose from 38 to over 60 percent of GDP in three years.
Without faster economic growth and actions to reduce deficits, publicly held national debt is 
AND
that would almost certainly compel a radical retrenchment of the United States internationally.
Such scenarios would reshape the international order. It was the economic devastation of Britain 
AND
be compelled to retrench, reducing its military spending and shedding international commitments.
We face this domestic challenge while other major powers are experiencing rapid economic growth. 
AND
preclude or respond to international crises because of the higher risk of escalation.
The stakes are high. In modern history, the longest period of peace among the great powers has been the era of U.S. leadership. By contrast, multi-polar systems have been unstable, with their competitive dynamics resulting in frequent crises and major wars among the great powers. Failures of multi-polar international systems produced both world wars.
American retrenchment could have devastating consequences. Without an American security blanket, regional powers 
AND
, hostile states would be emboldened to make aggressive moves in their regions.


==== Unchecked global warming causes extinction.====

We need to get prepared for four degrees of global warming, Bob Watson told 
AND
warming caused by human emissions could propel us towards a similar hothouse Earth.

**McWhorter 92**, Professor of Philosophy at Northeast Missouri State, 92  (LaDelle, Heidegger and the Earth, ed: McWhorter, p. vii-viii)

Guilt is a concept whose heritage and meaning occur within the ethical tradition of the 
AND
the event of thinking, even if what is shattered eventually is ourselves.


====Environmental ethics are rooted in the framework of metaphysics and the subject-object dualism, mandating we act as &amp;#34;subjects&amp;#34; over &amp;#34;objects&amp;#34; in the world.  This is a product of the calculative mindset, which always attempts to locate &amp;#34;problems&amp;#34; in which we must find &amp;#34;solutions&amp;#34; – using the core components of technology; theory production and conceptualization.  This project ultimately fails – only by embracing the radically transformative potential of our alternative can we address the root cause and achieve the goals that environmental ethics wish to see. ====

In the first place, the thinking of the first and other beginning, if

fosters are in large measure at the root of many of those problems. 
So the bottom line is that to try to derive &amp;#34;an ethics&amp;#34; from

by once again gathering ourselves to releasement toward things and openness to mystery.



====The critique outweighs – the prime danger is not that technological things will runs amok, but that technological thinking will erase the possibility of human freedom. The affirmative merely identifies a symptom and not a cause====

**Rojcewicz 06** (Richard Rojcewicz, Philosophy at Point Park College in Pittsburgh, The Gods And Technology: A Reading Of Heidegger, 2006, Kindle Edition. Kindle locations 944-969)
