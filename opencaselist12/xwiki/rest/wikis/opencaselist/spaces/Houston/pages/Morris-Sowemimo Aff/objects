Principle 1: The investment review law should be narrowly tailored and focused on national

investment in transactions that do not raise national security or other governmental interests.

====And, The broad interpretation of national security fails – creates economic uncertainty, protectionism and hampers US foreign policy goals.====
**Carroll-Emory International Law Review-09** (Jamie FF, COMMENT: BACK TO THE FUTURE: REDEFINING THE FOREIGN INVESTMENT AND NATIONAL SECURITY ACT~’S CONCEPTION OF NATIONAL SECURITY, 23 Emory Int~’l L. Rev. 167)

The broad and vague interpretation of national security by the CFIUS creates four distinct problems
AND
foreign policy goals, just when such cooperation is essential to global peace.

====Finally, Only a narrow wind-energy specific Limit to national security solves, the plan creates clarity and predictability. ====
