realistic strategy to achieve rural electrification. n318 This study also found that the practical effect of choosing a strategy for rural electrification based on extending transmission lines from centralized power plants will be that most rural communities in the LDCs that do not have electricity will never be connected to a power grid. n319 One should bear in mind, of course, that the traditional homelands of most of the world&amp;#39;s indigenous peoples are located in rural areas of the LDCs.&#xD;
Through a decade in which the Executive Branch of the United States government has been controlled by administrations that have demonstrated indifference and hostility toward soft-path options, the United States economy nevertheless has made substantial progress along several of the soft paths. n320 Progress also has been achieved in the LDCs, some of which have adopted innovative programs to spur decentralized, renewable, energy  [*740]  development. n321 Analysts have recommended a variety of ways to speed up this progress. n322 This part of the Article focuses on ways in which tribal governments could use their governmental powers to help people in Indian country choose soft energy paths and, drawing on experiences of the LDCs, suggests some ways in which tribal governments in this country could help to make soft energy paths viable choices for indigenous peoples and other rural communities in the LDCs.&#xD;
A. Critical Needs&#xD;
In the United States and other industrialized countries, purchases of end-use energy benefits are made in markets that are heavily distorted by subsidies and regulation. n323 Governmental institutions for regulating electricity evolved in tandem with the technologies of centralized power generation and transmission at a time when electric power was treated as a &amp;#34;natural monopoly.&amp;#34; As a result, many of these institutions have been slow to respond to the range of possibilities offered by new technologies. n324 Unfortunately, the LDCs have borrowed many aspects of the industrialized world&amp;#39;s institutional framework. If widespread adoption of soft path options is to be a realistic possibility in the near term, concerted measures must be taken to overcome market distortions and to allow purchasers of end-use energy benefits to make informed decisions while choosing among a wide range of options.&#xD;
Based on experiences in many LDCs, the United Nations Department of Technical Co-operation for Development has identified four conditions that must be met if widespread adoption of soft path options is to be possible in the rural areas of the LDCs: (1) existence of political will; (2) existence and knowledge  [*741]  of resources; (3) creation of local technical capacities; and (4) creation of an appropriate funding system. n325 As presented in this United Nations study, these prerequisites apply to the use of decentralized renewable energy systems to achieve rural electrification, but meeting these conditions would also expedite the widespread adoption of nonelectric, renewable energy systems and energy efficiency measures. Attention to these conditions would expedite the widespread adoption of soft energy paths in Indian country in the United States as well. n326&#xD;
1. Political Will -- Political will is needed at all levels of government. Because energy marketplaces are heavily influenced by governmental policies, policies that promote conventional energy development will tend to retard soft energy development. n327 In the international context, considerations of global equity influence political will in a perverse way, as many national leaders in the LDCs tend to utilize the energy technologies -- particularly large-scale, centralized power plants -- that they perceive as being favored in the industrialized countries. If national leaders in industrialized countries were to make soft energy options the priority at home, perhaps national leaders in LDCs would give more prominence to soft-path options in their own energy strategies. Although such national leadership is important, local political leadership is also critical. In fact, the movement for sustainable energy development in both the industrialized world and the Third World is taking place primarily at the grass-roots level, and tribal leaders in the United States could play leading roles in this movement.&#xD;

Independently, the plan is key to U.S. water leadership – technical, capacity and knowledge solve water international water disputes and global instability&#xD;
Center for Strategic and International Studies, 9/30/2005, Addressing Our Global Water Future, p. 14-17&#xD;
Water is a missing element for support of many U.S. strategic pursuits abroad. Enabling and supporting other countries as they establish integrated strategies for managing water supplies is important for maintaining and fostering peace and stability between and within countries. This is particularly true as trends in population and natural resource consumption continue to put pressure on economies and governance structures. Because water is so integral to every aspect of human life and activity, many strategies to promote economic development or humanitarian relief (e.g., poverty reduction or HIV/AIDS relief) cannot be achieved without pronounced attention to water. By fostering inclusive decision-making and management processes at a local scale, water projects can also strengthen democracy-building projects in areas where such projects are not well received. Water should be a key component in any short-term or long-term regional stabilization and reconstruction effort. Water scarcity, water quality, and water management could both positively and negatively impact every major U.S. strategic priority in every key region of the world. For all of these reasons, water can no longer be regarded exclusively as a function of U.S. humanitarian and foreign assistance policies. It has significant security, political, social, economic and commercial implications for U.S. interests as well. For this reason, there is a strong argument to be made that U.S. policymakers should elevate water on the list of enduring U.S. interests. Water has become a strategic and foundational element of U.S. international interests. ¬Finding 14: An integrated, comprehensive international U.S. water policy is essential: The United States has the technical capacity, knowledge, and wealth to help relieve water scarcity problems in countries and regions around the world. However, a lack of coordination and prioritization among all the different agencies involved in the decision making and policy implementation process has lead to a largely ad hoc approach to global water issues. The United States should therefore develop a coherent, comprehensive water strategy for meeting global water challenges in order to maximize its impact and achieve broader U.S. foreign policy objectives. The United States is well positioned to take the lead in addressing global water issues. The U.S. already contributes a significant amount of resources to international water issues—an estimated $3 billion between 2000 and 2004. However, it remains unclear whether these commitments adequately reflect the absolute importance of water to overall foreign policy goals. Official Development Assistance has vacillated significantly in the past decade. The increase in funding by the Bush administration through the “Water for the Poor Initiative” and the commitment made at the World Summit on Sustainable Development are noteworthy, but represent one-time commitments without the accompanying evaluation of needs, priorities, and internal coordination necessary to adequately address the challenges. On the other hand, two attempts have been made by Congress in the past year to elevate the strategic importance of water and to improve coordination—but these risk becoming unfunded mandates. At the operational level, nearly every federal agency or research institution has conducted an international water project. Yet each applies this expertise and experience on a limited, ad-hoc basis. Significant research and development is taking place within the United States in an effort to address our own water scarcity and water quality problems, and these efforts can be usefully applied in regions around the world. Furthermore, the majority of official development assistance for water is conducted on a bilateral basis through USAID and does not reach some of the countries with the greatest water needs. Development of an integrated and cohesive international policy on water will be a major step forward in mobilizing and coordinating the vast resources of the U.S. Government already engaged on global water issues. Such a step may also be critical to achieving many U.S. foreign policy goals. CONCLUSIONS and RECOMMENDATIONS Natural resource availability and sustainability are precursors to global economic and political stability, which, in turn, are precursors to U.S. national security interests. The findings described above offer the components for a comprehensive and ultimately sustainable approach to managing water resources at the local, regional and global levels. These findings address not only physical water scarcity and water quality issues, but also the capacity building, policy-making, economic and governance issues that are interwoven with the water challenges. The implementation of these findings will not only help resolve water scarcity problems, but will also contribute to greater regional and global stability, improved governance, and the greater spread of democratic principles—all of which will strengthen the sustainable management of water and other resources. Water weaves together international goals for human development, economic prosperity, peace and stability, no matter what the region, what the circumstances, or what the goal. These water challenges present important risks and opportunities for U.S. international strategic interests. Failure to act could lead toward continued economic stagnation. Failure to engage could contribute to domestic and international tensions or unrest, and it could result in further human suffering and death across the planet. Proactive, innovative, and coordinated actions by the United States, on the other hand, will advance every major strategic priority of U.S. foreign policy—most notably economic development and the building of democratic institutions and practices. Water can no longer be regarded solely as a tool or by-product of U.S. development and humanitarian programs. Instead, it should be recognized as a lynchpin for the broader international engagement strategy of the United States. Policies focused on water in regions across the planet must be regarded as a critical element in U.S. national security strategy. Such policies should be part of a broader, comprehensive, and integrated U.S. strategy toward global water challenges. In the light of these considerations, the CSIS-SNL Global Water Futures project offers the following policy recommendations on how to proceed: a. The United States is in critical need of a long-range, integrated strategy for international water. In order to develop such a strategy the U.S. government will need to carry out an inventory of existing international water-related policies and projects, identify a lead agency to coordinate the development of an integrated strategy, convene the many departments and agencies in the U.S. Government with established interests and activities relating to water, undertake a global region by region review of resources and needs engaging regional experts, and consult with third-party groups—i.e., the private sector and the NGO community—to get their feedback and input. b. As a foundation for the development of an integrated strategy for the United States, we must acknowledge that U.S. international water policy has implications that transcend traditional humanitarian and foreign assistance interests. Water is already a critical element in broader U.S. foreign policy and security interests. It will become all the more significant in the future, especially if the dislocations are allowed to become even more acute. c. The proposed U.S. international water strategy must be informed by a detailed understanding of the potential impacts of emerging, new technologies and the need for a differentiated approach to the deployment of technology in various regions across the world. This implies the development of partnerships—between government, the private sector, and NGOs—in the development of ideas to “match” technologies with conditions on the ground. This technological plan should be informed by an assessment of optimal use of current technology and by the potential impact of emerging new technology. d. One key characteristic of the proposed U.S. international water strategy is the identification of realistic goals and metrics to gauge progress and to enable periodic and regular assessments of progress. Such indicators are essential to recalibrating goals and approaches, if necessary. This process should include thorough review and analysis of successes and failures associated with previous water projects. e. The U.S. international water strategy should include the implementation of pilot projects in different regions and at different scales. These will test the approaches and applications described in this White Paper, promote the continued development of better approaches and applications, and inform the development of larger-scale projects. Regions that should be of highest priority are sub-Saharan Africa, where the flow of funds from international donors has been substantially smaller than the objectively defined needs of water access and water sanitation, and the Middle East, where secure, sustainable water resources are already widely seen as key to political stability.&#xD;
Expert consensus concludes wind power effectively curbs emissions – contrary evidence comes from bias hacks&#xD;

[Dr. Robert, Senior Lecturer in Energy and Environmental Policy at Imperial, runs the Technology and Policy Assessment theme of UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC) and has a long standing interest in the costs of energy technologies and in the issue of &amp;#39;intermittency&amp;#39;.,&amp;#34;Are wind turbines increasing carbon emissions?”, http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2012/jan/09/wind-turbines-increasing-carbon-emissions, accessed: 8-23-12]&#xD;
&#xD;
12.54pm: I have received this reaction from Dr Robert Gross, via the UK Energy Research Centre:&#xD;
    I am Director of the Centre for Energy Policy and Technology at Imperial College and Senior Lecturer in Energy and Environmental Policy at Imperial. I run the Technology and Policy Assessment theme of UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC). I have a long standing interest in the costs of energy technologies and in the issue of &amp;#39;intermittency&amp;#39;.&#xD;
    The technical implications of integrating wind into modern electricity systems are well understood and have been reviewed across many countries, mixes of power plant, climatic conditions and levels of wind penetration. In this subject, as in most others, there is a large body of broadly consistent analyses, undertaken by technically competent bodies such as university research groups, specialist consultancies and network operators. There is also a smattering of &amp;#39;outliers&amp;#39;, often produced by individuals or groups with particular agendas, such as anti-wind lobby groups. Extreme estimates usually result from flawed or overly simplistic methodologies, unrealistic assumptions, or misallocation of costs.&#xD;
    UKERC undertook a thoroughgoing review of the evidence base available in 2006 on the costs and impacts of intermittency, and is in the process of compiling a new review of the relative costs of different generation options, for publication later this year. Electrical engineering based modelling and simulation, and increasingly empirical data from countries where the penetration of wind farms has reached a significant level (such as Ireland, Denmark, Spain, Germany and some US states), demonstrates conclusively that wind does reduce emissions. Economic studies also indicate that the costs of intermittency, though potentially significant (particularly when wind reaches very large penetrations), are currently very small in the UK context. UKERC&amp;#39;s assessment concludes that intermittency typically represents less than 10% of the costs of power generation when wind is below 20% of electricity - less than £9/MWh rather than the £60/MWh cited by Civitas. The potential efficiency losses that result from increased &amp;#39;cycling&amp;#39; of fossil fuel stations responding to wind intermittency are real, but represent a very small fraction of the savings in emissions and fuel that results from the electrical output of wind. UKERC&amp;#39;s review indicates that losses typically amount to just 1% of the percentage savings. The options for dealing with intermittency are also diverse; including increasing interconnection, demand side response, and storage, as well as fossil fuel back up.&#xD;
    There is also a substantial consensus that the lifecycle carbon emissions associated with the construction and maintaining of wind power are very small compared to those of fossil fuel sources.&#xD;
    I find it disappointing that Civitas has chosen to disregard the large body of analysis that indicates that the costs and impacts of intermittency are modest and that wind is an effective fuel saver. There is of course a legitimate debate about the cost and feasibility of the 2020 target for renewables, about which renewables deserve how much support, how best to deliver such support and the role of nuclear, carbon capture and other supply options. This debate is not well served by reporting which ignores the findings of a large body of credible, peer reviewed and professional analyses and selects extreme estimates which have not been peer reviewed, do not emerge from credible engineering/economic simulations or models and are widely out of step with the scientific consensus.&#xD;

Federal Action is key – only the plan deals with a comprehensive national program – localized action creates unintended price wars&#xD;
Hamilton, UConn Law JD Candidate, 2012 &#xD;
[Jessica A., &amp;#34;Finding New Power in the Wind, the Earth, and the Sun: A Survey of the Regulation of Alternative Energy Generated on American Indian Reservations in the United States and First Nation Reserves in Canada,&amp;#34; Connecticut Law Review April, 2012 Connecticut Law Review 44 Conn.

&#xD;
With the exception of a handful of strong, federal incentives for  [*1402]  renewable energy, including the Production Tax Credit (&amp;#34;PTC&amp;#34;), the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the Farm Bill, and presidential Executive Order 13423, &amp;#34;Strengthening Federal Environmental, Energy, and Transportation Management,&amp;#34; most renewable energy policy activity occurs at a state level in the form of renewable portfolio standards, which set requirements for minimum levels of renewable energy production. n111 These renewable portfolio standards are &amp;#34;some of the most significant policy drivers for new renewable resources,&amp;#34; n112 and all of the provinces and almost half of the states have adopted some type of target for the supply of renewable energy. n113 In the United States, this practice is known as individual minimum renewable standards, which some claim has the unintended side-effect of driving up the overall price of electricity compared to that generated by traditional fossil fuel. n114 Only seven states have extended their minimum renewable energy generation requirements to Indian Tribes. n115&#xD;
While both the states and the provinces in the United States and Canada appear to be aggressively enacting renewable energy programs and incentives, n116 the impact of these localized actions is &amp;#34;still modest relative to the potential impact of more aggressive federal policy,&amp;#34; n117 which could coordinate and fund renewable energy projects on a much larger scale. Consequently, while developing renewable energy projects on reserves and reservations is more likely to immediately benefit from state- and province-directed programs, there is a greater potential for long-term renewable energy development through federal initiatives. &#xD;

To date, however, climate justice as a sub-discipline of environmental justice (or environmental law for that matter), is not clearly carved out and cultivated in the legal literature.101 In the following section, I elaborate on climate justice as a field addressing the United States‟ moral and other obligations to racial and class subalterns, particularly its own.&#xD;

Perhaps it will be thought I am hiding behind an abstract (bourgeois) conception of voluntarism and simply ignoring the greater radical edge of eco-anarchism, wherein lies its greater appeal. But the more the greater radicalness of eco-anarchist, over eco-reformist, activity is emphasized, the more it slides back into unrealistic utopianism. ………&#xD;
That hope seems more unrealistic—more utopian in that sense—than that of liberal reform. The main worry is that those from the authoritarian end of the spectrum will convince people the liberal mainstream is inherently incapable of reform and so must be replaced by more coercive forms of Green politics (and that people from the left will help with the critique, provide no realistic, non-utopian, alternative themselves, thus leaving open the latter).&#xD;

Conclusion: Toward a Rhetoric of Eco-Justice&#xD;
I have argued on two fronts that pragmatic rhetoric and environmental communication should be deeply pragmatic, that is, in the sense of endorsing several full-blooded commitments found in philosophical pragmatism. ………..&#xD;
In the newly emerging environmental discourse, a focus on rhetoric, not value theory, as well as a deeply, not shallowly, pragmatic rhetoric, offers a superior route toward advancing an agenda that preserves the natural environment and promotes ecological justice—or so I argue.&#xD;

Power is not a dirty word or an unfortunate feature of the world. ……….Moral absolutism inhibits this   judgment. It alienates those who are not true believers. It promotes arrogance. And   it undermines political effectiveness. &#xD;

4. Turn – Value to life – external claims destroy it&#xD;
Schwartz, Glasgow Philosophy Professor, 2003, &#xD;
(Lisa, “The Value to Life: Who Decides and How?” www.fleshandbones/readingroom/pdf/399.pdf)&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
The second assertion made by supporters of the quality of life as a criterion for decision- making is closely related to the first, but with an added dimension. &#xD;
&#xD;
It is important to remember the subjectivity assertion in this context, so as to emphasize that the judgement made about the value of a life ought to be made only by the person concerned and not by others. &#xD;

 No root cause - War creates gendered hierarchies – not the other way around &#xD;

&#xD;
First, peace activists face a dilemma in thinking about causes of war and working for peace. .&#xD;
&#xD;
The dilemma is that peace work focused on justice brings to the peace movement energy, allies and moral grounding, yet, in light of this book’s evidence, the emphasis on injustice as the main cause of war seems to be empirically inadequate.&#xD;
 No link – Even if stewardship born out of a destructive ideology that doesn’t mean it can’t be given new meaning to prevent environmental destruction&#xD;

Perhaps it will be thought I am hiding behind an abstract (bourgeois) conception of voluntarism and simply ignoring the greater radical edge of eco-anarchism, wherein lies its greater appeal……..&#xD;

(--) Romney can’t come back—it’s over:&#xD;
Cenk Uygur, 10/1/2012 (host of the Young Turks, “This Election Is Already Over - Obama Has Won,” http://www.huffingtonpost.com/cenk-uygur/obama-polls-lead_b_1927955.html?, Accessed 10/5/2012, rwg)&#xD;
There&amp;#39;s another poll out today showing President Obama with a nine point lead in Ohio. .&#xD;
But if you look at the numbers objectively, for all intents and purposes, this thing is already in the books. It&amp;#39;s over. President Obama will get re-elected.&#xD;
(--) No Link:  Evidence doesn’t assume Indian Country.&#xD;
(--) Turn:  THE BASE:&#xD;
A) Anti-global warming initiatives are key for Obama’s environmental base:&#xD;
Joel Kotkin, 7/2008 (presidential fellow at Chapman University, “The Democrats’ Dilemma,”&#xD;
http://www.american.com/archive/2008/july-august-magazine-contents/the-democrats2019-dilemma, Accessed 10/1/2012, rwg)&#xD;
The Democrats will be running against a far weaker Republican Party than they did in the 1990s. &#xD;
&#xD;
Although this has not been a major topic in the primaries, the key Obama constituency among educated young voters tends to be the most fervent on issues such as global warming.&#xD;
B)  Obama’s base key to the election:&#xD;
NATE SILVER, 9/6/2012 (chief pollster for New York Times, “Obama Would Be Big Favorite With ‘Fired Up’ Base,” http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/06/obama-would-be-big-favorite-with-fired-up-base/, Accessed 9/9/2012, rwg)&#xD;
There’s one advantage that President Obama has that Mitt Romney probably doesn’t. &#xD;
&#xD;
If he can get a good turnout from his base, he’ll be the heavy favorite to win in November — even if Mr. Romney gets a strong turnout as well.  On average over the last five public surveys, 35 percent of registered voters identify themselves as Democrats and 30 percent as Republicans. That advantage is down somewhat for Democrats since 2008, but it is an advantage nevertheless.&#xD;
(--) Public won’t notice the plan—no proof they’ll perceive it.&#xD;
(--) Romney is a tool—he can’t capitalize on Obama’s mistakes:&#xD;
Julie Hirschfeld Davis, 9/26/2012 (staff writer, “Romney&amp;#39;s High Unfavorable Rating Hampers Message on Economy,”  http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-09-25/romney-negativity-muddies-message-as-obama-leads-in-poll, Accessed 9/27/2012, rwg)&#xD;
Republican Mitt Romney’s negative ratings are preventing him from capitalizing on President Barack Obama’s vulnerabilities in the race for the White House, according to a new poll that gives the incumbent a lead heading into the first of three presidential debates.¶ &#xD;
Half of Americans hold an unfavorable view of Romney -- a September high for a presidential challenger in the last three decades. Forty-nine percent of likely voters consider the former Massachusetts governor out of touch, compared with 40 percent who say that of Obama, in the latest Bloomberg National Poll conducted Sept. 21-24.&#xD;
(--) Non-Intrinsic:  Do the plan and don’t initiate their impact scenario.&#xD;
(--) No internal link:  energy not a key issue:&#xD;
Herman Wang, 9/27/2012 (staff writer, “Even with US gasoline prices at a higher number, energy isn’t a big deal in White House race,” http://blogs.platts.com/2012/09/27 /energy_campaign/, Accessed 10/5/2012, rwg)&#xD;
The respected polling firm Gallup asked voters in August what the most important issue facing the country was, and only 1% cited energy. &#xD;
That’s down sharply from the 25% of poll respondents who cited energy as the top issue in the days before the 2008 election, in which Republicans coined the rallying cry “Drill, baby, drill!” in response to high oil and gasoline prices.¶ This time around, the economy, unemployment, general dissatisfaction with government and health care are greater concerns for voters, said Frank Newport, editor in chief of The Gallup Poll.¶ &#xD;
Energy “doesn’t show up when we [ask voters] to tell us in your own words why you’re voting for the candidates,” he said. “We just don’t see much evidence that it’s a high top-of-mind issue in the campaign.”&#xD;
(--) Too far gone—Just a few weeks away—voters will forget about the plan and the three remaining debates swamp any effect of the plan.&#xD;
(--) UQ overwhelms for women and the key issue is the economy—not energy:&#xD;
Ariel Edwards-Levy, 8/30/2012 (staff writer, “Female Voters Prefer Obama To Romney, Are Focused On Economy, Poll Says,” http://www.huffingtonpost.com /2012/08/30/female-voters-obama-romney-poll_n_1844312.html?1346360706, Accessed 10/5/2012, rwg)&#xD;
Obama received support from 52 percent of likely female voters, compared to 36 percent for Romney. &#xD;
And although nine out of 10 women said it was important that a candidate understand women, even more prioritized an understanding of the middle class, with 94 percent calling it important.&#xD;
(--) Obama wouldn’t get the blame—Congress would.&#xD;
(--) Turn - Wind PTC is extremely popular with Iowa and Colorado – plan would swing the election for Obama &#xD;

&#xD;
When the political world ponders which issues will matter most on Election Day, it&amp;#39;s pretty easy to come up with a laundry list: jobs, economic growth, health care, foreign policy, immigration, etc.¶ &#xD;
&#xD;
An issue like this can shift thousands of votes, which may well make the difference between victory and defeat.&#xD;
(--) Plan goes to the bottom of the docket and happens after the election.&#xD;
Iran &#xD;
 Romney won’t attack Iran—fears economic impact:&#xD;
Robert Maginnis, 10/2/2012 (staff writer, “Is war with Iran more likely under Obama than Romney?” http://www.humanevents.com/2012/10/02/is-war-with-iran-more-likely-under-obama-than-romney/, Accessed 10/3/2012, rwg)&#xD;
War with Iran over that nation’s nuclear weapons program is more likely and will happen sooner if President Barack Obama is re-elected as opposed to Governor Mitt Romney winning the presidency.¶&#xD;
. By comparison, Romney would have his hands full with his signature issue, the economy and would avoid war because of the economic impact.&#xD;

Russia &#xD;
Zero risk of Russian war&#xD;
Graham 7 (Thomas Graham, senior advisor on Russia in the US National Security Council staff 2002-2007, 2007, &amp;#34;Russia in Global Affairs” The Dialectics of Strength and Weakness http://eng.globalaffairs.ru/numbers/20/1129.html)&#xD;
An astute historian of Russia, Martin Malia, wrote several years ago that “Russia has at different times been demonized or divinized by Western opinion less because of her real role in Europe than because of the fears and frustrations, or hopes and aspirations, generated within European society by its own domestic problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
Political gridlock in key Western countries, however, precludes the creativity, risk-taking, and subtlety needed to advance our interests on issues over which we are at odds with Russia while laying the basis for more constructive long-term relations with Russia.&#xD;

In his Sept. 3 op-ed column, “A foreign policy choice,” Jackson Diehl wrote that a President Romney “will surely drop his threats to start a trade war with China, just as [George W.] Bush and Bill Clinton did.” &#xD;
&#xD;
A President Romney will surely continue the diplomatic pivot/rebalancing to Asia begun by President George W. Bush and accelerated by President Obama and, one hopes, will back the rhetoric with military resources.&#xD;

Not all democracies do things so poorly. &#xD;
&#xD;

The DOD energy burden is so significant that it may prevent the execution of new and still evolving operational concepts, which require the rapid and constant transport of resources without regard for the energy costs. &#xD;
Reducing our dependency on oil should make these resources available for investment in future force and infrastructure needs.&#xD;

When state and federal law conflict, Congress&amp;#39;s plenary power over Indian affairs is controlling. n6 Consequently, state courts do not have the power to  [*142]  make determinations of tribal entity immunity, and any decision that purports to do so is substantially preempted by federal policy. n7&#xD;
