The first is limits - a targeted dialogue with clearly demarcated and equitable sides of controversy is key to cultivate agency and decisionmaking skills that affect our everyday lives – we may be able to engage with their advocacy on a conceptually broad level but that’s not sufficient to make it valuably debatable – confining the controversy to a specific question still allows for affirmative creativity but prevents the debate from devolving into a competing set of untestable facts

Debate is a means of settling...outlined in the following discussion.
The second link argument is that the simulation of policy proposals are key to skills development - Policy simulations revolutionize traditional forms of pedagogy by situating students as the agents of the decision-making process -  we control terminal uniqueness for changing mindsets – students already have preconceived notions of how the world works – engagements with the resolution encourage debaters to abandon their perspective in order to improve societal outcomes

These government or quasi-government...contextualize and act on information
The third link argument is that switch side debate is key – The conditions necessary to produce effective deliberation not only enhances agency skills, but can only be realized in a switch-side format where participants step outside of their own perspective and engage in political contestation
