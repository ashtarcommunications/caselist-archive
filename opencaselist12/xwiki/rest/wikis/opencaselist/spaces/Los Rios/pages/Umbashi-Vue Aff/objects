The United States Federal Government should substantially increase financial incentives for solar energy production in the United States by eliminating tariffs on crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells imported from the People’s Republic of China.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
New tariffs are drastically increasing the price of Chinese solar panels in the US.&#xD;

The United States on Thursday announced the imposition of antidumping tariffs of more than 31 &#xD;
AND&#xD;
likely to mean a substantial increase in the price of solar panels here.&#xD;
&#xD;
Nearly half of planned US installations were going to use Chinese solar panels.&#xD;

But the real story is more complicated. For one thing, cheap Chinese panels &#xD;

These tariffs are crushing solar energy production – cost is the key factor keeping Americans from installing solar panels.&#xD;

&#xD;
But a close look at the U.S. solar industry suggests that the &#xD;
AND&#xD;
terms of going solar is whether they can save money,” Rive said.&#xD;
&#xD;
Tariffs choke American solar industry – all the jobs are in sales, installation, and maintenance, not production.&#xD;

Slowing down solar development is undesirable in general. Remember, solar at scale represents &#xD;

we just ceded the advantage in getting Saudi’s solar business to Chinese firms. &#xD;

Economic crisis causes war – internal conflict spawns wars over resources&#xD;

Less intuitive is how periods of economic decline may increase the likelihood of external conflict&#xD;
AND&#xD;
As such the view presented here should be considered ancillary to those views. &#xD;
