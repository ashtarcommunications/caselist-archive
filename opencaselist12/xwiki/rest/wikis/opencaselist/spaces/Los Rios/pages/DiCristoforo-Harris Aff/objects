The United States Federal Government should substantially increase financial incentives for solar energy production in the United States by rejecting tariffs on crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells imported from the People’s Republic of China.
Solar Solvency
New tariffs are drastically increasing the price of Chinese solar panels in the US.

But the real story is … &amp;#34;There&amp;#39;s no way to avoid that.&amp;#34;
These tariffs are crushing solar energy production – cost is the key factor keeping Americans from installing solar panels.

But a close look at the … can save money,” Rive said.

Energy Independence Advantage
Tariffs choke American solar industry – all the jobs are in sales, installation, and maintenance, not production.

But despite these complexities… Sherlock Holmes and Queen Victoria.

China Relations Advantage
 
US China relations are on the brink now – tariff pushes them over the edge

The areas of maximum danger … ineffective when confronted with major crises.

Energy Democratization Advantage
Solar has the power to decentralize the current system through widespread distribution of individualized power generation.
