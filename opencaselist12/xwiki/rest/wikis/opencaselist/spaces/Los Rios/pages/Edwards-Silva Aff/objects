The United States Federal Government should substantially increase financial incentives for solar energy production in the United States by eliminating tariffs on crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells imported from the People’s Republic of China.

Solar Solvency (1/3)
New tariffs are drastically increasing the price of Chinese solar panels in the US.

The United States on Thursday announced the imposition of antidumping tariffs of more than 31

likely to mean a substantial increase in the price of solar panels here.
Solar Solvency (2/3)
Nearly half of planned US installations were going to use Chinese solar panels.

These tariffs are crushing solar energy production – cost is the key factor keeping Americans from installing solar panels.

But a close look at the U.S. solar industry suggests that the

Energy Independence Advantage

Tariffs choke American solar industry – all the jobs are in sales, installation, and maintenance, not production.

Solar development key to energy independence and preventing economic crisis

Slowing down solar development is undesirable in general. Remember, solar at scale represents

we just ceded the advantage in getting Saudi’s solar business to Chinese firms. 
 
Energy Independence Advantage (3/6)
Scenario 1: Economy
Economic crisis causes war – internal conflict spawns wars over resources

Royal 10 (Jedediah, director of Cooperative Threat Reduction at the U.S. Department of Defense, Economics of War and Peace: Economic, Legal, and Political Perspectives, pg 213-215)

Less intuitive is how periods of economic decline may increase the likelihood of external conflict

As such the view presented here should be considered ancillary to those views.

Scenario 2: Environment
Renewable energy is key to stop global warming.

In summary, Myhrvold and Caldeira have shown in pretty stark terms that, if

Warming causes extinction – melting polar ice caps and massive carbon release.

Solar has the power to decentralize the current system through widespread distribution of individualized power generation.

Short-term market mechanisms are the only solution to environmental destruction.

Without the plan, further environmental justice threatens to dehumanize

We must seek justice for environmental racism – that’s critical to preventing global collapse
