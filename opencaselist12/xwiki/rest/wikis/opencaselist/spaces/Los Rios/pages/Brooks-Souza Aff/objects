The United States Federal Government should substantially increase financial incentives for solar energy production in the United States by rejecting tariffs on crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells imported from the People’s Republic of China.&#xD;
Solar Solvency&#xD;
New tariffs are drastically increasing the price of Chinese solar panels in the US.&#xD;

&#xD;
But the real story is … &amp;#34;There&amp;#39;s no way to avoid that.&amp;#34;&#xD;
These tariffs are crushing solar energy production – cost is the key factor keeping Americans from installing solar panels.&#xD;
&#xD;
Bensinger 12&#xD;
(Ken, April 23, Los Angeles Times Staff Writer, “U.S. tariffs on Chinese solar cells fuel debate about green jobs,” http://articles.latimes.com/2012/apr/23/business/la-fi-solar-jobs-20120423, d/a 8-2-12, ads)&#xD;
&#xD;
But a close look at the … can save money,” Rive said.&#xD;
&#xD;
Energy Independence Advantage&#xD;
Tariffs choke American solar industry – all the jobs are in sales, installation, and maintenance, not production.&#xD;

Slowing down solar development … solar business to Chinese firms.&#xD;

Economic crisis causes war–strong statistical support &#xD;

&#xD;
But despite these complexities… Sherlock Holmes and Queen Victoria.&#xD;

China Relations Advantage&#xD;

US China relations are on the brink now – tariff pushes them over the edge&#xD;

On Monday, the United States reached the legal limit of its borrowing authority – further evidence that out-of-control spending is a matter of national security. Serious reforms and government spending cuts need to be made to avoid severe economic disruptions – both in the short and long-term. The national debt and deficits are rising at an unconscionable rate. The national debt now exceeds $14 trillion, and the government is still piling up debt at the rate of $200 million an hour, $30 billion a week, $120 billion a month and $1.6 trillion a year. It~’s clear we don~’t have a revenue problem – we have a spending problem. Raising the debt ceiling without these serious reforms will only burden our future generations with outrageous debt.  Worse, the president and Senate Democrats are saying they want a &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; debt ceiling increase, which means that they want to continue spending and borrowing more money with no strings attached. My view is we must not raise the debt ceiling by $1 without simultaneously making deep cuts in spending and taking real steps towards a balanced budget.  It is imperative to the future of the country that we fight for an immediate shift toward fiscal responsibility. That is why I, along with my colleagues in the Republican Study Committee (RSC), wrote a letter to House Speaker John Boehner asking him to &amp;#34;Cut, Cap and Balance.&amp;#34; Specifically, we advocated for discretionary and mandatory spending reductions that would cut the deficit in half next year; enacting statutory, enforceable total-spending caps to reduce federal spending to 18 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP); and a Balanced Budget Constitutional Amendment (BBA) with strong protections against federal tax increases and including a Spending Limitation Amendment (SLA). This proposal will put us on a path to prosperity, and I will work to see provisions like this are included in any final agreement. I believe it is prudent to limit the extension of borrowing authority as much as possible, in order to demand accountability from Senate Democrats and the Obama Administration. Every day, we see more and more evidence of the need to confront the problem now. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) report released in April adds urgency to the need for meaningful actions — both short and long-term — to confront the nation~’s debt head-on. Additionally, Moody~’s Analytics released a report several weeks ago forecasting a downgrade in our country~’s bond rating. It~’s clear that if we fail to stop the spending spree, our nation will face economic collapse in the long-term.&#xD;

Generally, wind energy has zero direct air pollution. A small amount of CO2

====The disad is an additional advantage to the case.

Just two weeks ago Mitt Romney~’s advisers openly discussed trying to win the White House without Ohio, but his campaign is now displaying renewed vigor in its fight for the state~’s 18 electoral votes, Jeff Zeleny and Jim Rutenberg report.
