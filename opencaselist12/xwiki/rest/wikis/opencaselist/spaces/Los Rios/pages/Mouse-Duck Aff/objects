Solar Solvency (1/3)
New tariffs are drastically increasing the price of Chinese solar panels in the US.

The United States on Thursday announced the imposition of antidumping tariffs of more than 31 
AND
likely to mean a substantial increase in the price of solar panels here.
Solar Solvency (2/3)
Nearly half of planned US installations were going to use Chinese solar panels.

But the real story is more complicated. For one thing, cheap Chinese panels 
AND
substantial impact,&amp;#34; he says. &amp;#34;There&amp;#39;s no way to avoid that.&amp;#34;
 
Solar Solvency (3/3)

These tariffs are crushing solar energy production – cost is the key factor keeping Americans from installing solar panels.

But a close look at the U.S. solar industry suggests that the 
AND
terms of going solar is whether they can save money,” Rive said.
Energy Democratization Advantage
 
 
Energy Democratization Advantage (1/4)
Solar has the power to decentralize the current system through widespread distribution of individualized power generation.

Himmelman 12 Jeff Himmelman, writing for the New York Times, “The Secret to Solar Power” http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/12/magazine/the-secret-to-solar-power.html?_r=1andpagewanted=alland_moc.semityn.wwwandfb_source=message#hTaoesb,4) sbb 

Silicon Valley has done a great job of talking about its disruptive potential, but 
AND
of 2003 and saved the U.S. economy several billion dollars.
 
Energy Democratization Advantage (2/4)
Short-term market mechanisms are the only solution to environmental destruction.
Bryant 12—professor of philosophy at Collin College (Levi, We’ll Never Do 
AND
there’s no way around this, and we do need to act now.
Energy Democratization Advantage (3/4)
Without the plan, further environmental justice threatens to dehumanize
Faber 08 (Daniel Faber, “Capitalizing on Environmental Injustice: The Polluter-Industrial Complex in the age of Globalization”, published by Rowman and Littlefield Publishers, 2008, ISBN, 0-7425-3391-3 pg124) mp

These inadequacies exacerbate antagonisms between people of color and the mainstream environmental movement. Such 
AND
never full participants in the decision-making which leads to them.21
 
Energy Democratization Advantage (4/4)

We must seek justice for environmental racism – that’s critical to preventing global collapse
Bryant 95 (Bunyan, Professor in the school of Natural Resources and Environment, and an adjunt professor in the center for Afro-American and African studies at the University of Michigan, “Environmental Justice: Issues, Policies, and Solutions, p.209-212, MV) 

The cooperative relations forged after World War II are now obsolete. New cooperative relations 
AND
the production cycle, we should at least have that as a goal.

 

Terrorism Add-on Scenario
Terrorism Add-on Scenario (1/3)
Scenario 3: Terrorism

Terrorists see oil market as US’s Achilles heel to destroy Western economy 

The Heritage Foundation 09 (The Heritage Foundation, 2009, “Reducing U.S. Dependence on Middle Eastern Oil”, Radical Islam, http://www.radicalislam.org/print/content/reducing-us-dependence-middle-eastern-oil) mp

The oil market operates today without cushions of additional production capacity or significant strategic petroleum 
AND
reduce its dependence on Middle Eastern oil as quickly and efficiently as possible.

 
Terrorism Add-on Scenario (2/3)
US dependence on ME oil causes growth of terrorism – attacks grow increasingly extreme 

The Heritage Foundation 09 (The Heritage Foundation, 2009, “Reducing U.S. Dependence on Middle Eastern Oil”, Radical Islam, http://www.radicalislam.org/print/content/reducing-us-dependence-middle-eastern-oil) mp

Many Arab leaders understand the dynamic of this dependence. For example, as early 
AND
challenges to energy security in Iraq, Iran, and Saudi Arabia illustrates.

 
Terrorism Add-on Scenario (3/3)
Terrorist attack triggers catalytic nuclear exchange—causes extinction.
Ayson 10 (Robert Ayson, Professor of Strategic Studies and directs the Centre for Strategic Studies: New Zealand. “After a Terrorist Nuclear Attack: Envisaging Catalytic Effects,” Studies in Conflict and Terrorism, Jul2010, Vol. 33 Issue 7, p571-593)
Of course, it could be argued that the more that states take the threat 
AND
a catalytic nuclear exchange is actually not what they are seeking to initiate.
