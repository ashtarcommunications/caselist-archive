Unfortunately, a great deal of ecocriticism  provides a toxic environment in which to  spawn &#xD;

====B. Difference is everywhere and can only be grappled with relationally. We should embrace the strangeness of the other as irreducible – only the kritik can deal with existence itself. We will need to let the 1ac die in order to save the whole of life. ====&#xD;

====If they affirm the Black as the Slave, we affirm against that the becoming of slavery in the figure of the Black as a runaway====&#xD;

====Blackness is a prison sentence and its becoming is the perverse gift of escape. Voting negative is an escape from the ontological prisonhouse of the 1AC depiction of Blackness====&#xD;

My field is black studies. In that field, I~~~’m trying to hoe the &#xD;

claim, with ridiculousness boldness, is the condition of possibility of politics.&#xD;
&#xD;
Their radical negativity that essentializes the Black as an ontological category excludes the ontological position of mixed race folks %26 prevents contestation of the meaning of whiteness as well as building coalitions for white allies in the struggle against white supremacy. Whether Black or White, the politics of purity is a failure&#xD;

Michael J. Monahan, Assistant Professor of Philosophy, Marquette University, Racial Justice and the Politics of Purity, ~~~’8, http://www.temple.edu/isrst/Events/documents/MichaelMonahanUpdated.doc&#xD;
The abolitionist/elimitavist position demands that any legitimately anti-racist endeavor stand simultaneously &#xD;
