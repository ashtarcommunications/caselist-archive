===Plan Text===

====The United States federal government should establish a feed-in tariff that creates long-term purchase contracts for new qualifying facilities that use wind and/or solar power for energy production to ensure a reasonable rate of return. ====

===Warming Adv===

====Catastrophic anthropogenic warming is happening – observable data and a scientific consensus confirm positive feedbacks will cause rapid warming triggering nuclear conflicts globally.====
**Kaku 11. **(Michio, PhD from Berkeley University. Author of Ph.D. level textbooks. &amp;#34;Physics of the Future.&amp;#34; [[http://213.55.83.52/ebooks/physics/Physics%20of%20the%20Future.pdf-http://213.55.83.52/ebooks/physics/Physics of the Future.pdf]])

By midcentury, the full impact of a fossil fuel economy should be in full 
AND
methane gas to be released, causing a runaway cycle of global warming. 


====Consensus over climate change now with over 90% certainty—We can~’t wait for certitude to act because it will be too late====
Dennis Patrick **O~’Hara **and Alan **Abelsohn 11**, Assistant professor of ethics as well as the Director of the Elliott Allen Institute for Theology and Ecology at the University of St. Michael~’s College and assistant professor in the Department of Family and Community Medicine, and the Dalla Lana School of Public Health and lecturer in the Centre for Environment, at the University of Toronto (Ethics %26 the Environment, Volume 16, Number 1, Spring)

Another disclaimer that has been used to justify delayed and inadequate responses to climate change 
AND
certitude, scientific or otherwise, contradicts the very pattern of our existence.


====Emissions are reversible but the window is closing.====
Fiona **Harvey 11** is an environmental correspondent for Guardian, &amp;#34;World headed for irreversible climate change in five years, IEA warns,&amp;#34; 11/9, http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/nov/09/fossil-fuel-infrastructure-climate-change

The world is likely to build so many fossil-fuelled power stations, energy
AND
temperatures to 2C of warming~~] will be closed forever,&amp;#34; said Birol.


====3 Internal Links====

====First is Renewable Generation====

====FITS key to optimize market for renewables====
Masterson 10. (Crystal D., Third Year student at University of Oklahoma College of Law, American Indian Law Review, &amp;#34;Wind-Energy Ventures in Indian Country: Fashioning a Functional Paradigm.&amp;#34; 2010. 34 Am. Indian L. Rev. 317 Lexis.)
The feed-in tariffs require that every utility connect and give priority to all 
AND
renewable energy&amp;#34; n265 and the potential for less expensive electricity altogether. n266

====Electricity sector is key polluter====
**Mormann 11** (Felix, German JD and JSD from University of Passau School of law, as well as an LMM from UC BerkeleySchool of Law and is a research Fellow at Stanford~’s Steyer Center for Energy Policy and Finance, writing for Economic Law Quarterly, &amp;#34;Requirements for a Renewables Revolution.&amp;#34; 05/02/11. http://www.boalt.org/elq/documents/elq38_4_03_2012_0808.pdf)
Renewable sources of energy are relevant not only to electricity generation but also to other 
AND
this Article focuses on the use of renewables for the generation of electricity.

====National FIT is modeled globally and solves resource shortages world wide====
**Lynch 8/9/12**, Advisor to Principal Solar Inc, Feed-in Tariffs: The Proven Road Not Taken – FierceEnergy, http://www.fierceenergy.com/story/feed-tariffs-proven-road-not-taken/2012-08-09~~%23ixzz24aVQZwDO
The U.S. needs a nationwide FIT to kick-start the renewable 
AND
foreign oil, while helping to decrease the associated massive annual cash drain. 

====Resource shortages escalate to global conflict====
Heinberg 12. (Richard, Senior Fellow of the Post Carbon Institute, Energy Bulletin, &amp;#34;Geopolitical implications of ~’Peak everything~’&amp;#34; January 10^^th^^ 2012. [[http://energybulletin.net/stories/2012-01-10/geopolitical-implications-%E2%80%9Cpeak-everything%E2%80%9D-http://energybulletin.net/stories/2012-01-10/geopolitical-implications-%E2%80%9Cpeak-everything%E2%80%9D]])
From competition among hunter-gatherers for wild game to imperialist wars over precious minerals
AND
—will most probably be economic and ecological ruin accompanied by political chaos.


====Second is Natural Gas====

====The US will be locked in to natural gas unless renewable alternatives are developed—Natural Gas causes methane release and fast warming====
Ted Nordhaus and Michael Shellenberger 12 are the authors of Break Through: From the Death of Environmentalism to the Politics of Possibility, Feb 27 (http://e360.yale.edu/feature/nordhaus_shellenberger_beyond_cap_and_trade_a_new_path_to_clean_energy/2499/)
A funny thing happened while environmentalists were trying and failing to cap carbon emissions in 
AND
fossil fuels. There simply is no substitute for making clean energy cheap.


====***FITs prevents volatile natural gas prices and frees up supply for the agriculture sector====
**Blake 09**, Maria, the Washington Monthly, &amp;#34;The Rooftop Revolution&amp;#34;, http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2009/0903.blake.html

You might expect that a system like this—one that allows countless independent producers 
AND
cut your use of natural gas, bringing prices down across the board.


====Diversity of fuels and decreased natural gas usage for energy production is essential to the future America~’s agricultural sector====
**IECA 3 **~~[Industrial Energy Consumers of America, nonprofit organization created to promote the interests of manufacturing companies for which the availability, use and cost of energy, power or feedstock play a significant role in their ability to compete, July 22 2003, &amp;#34;IMPACT OF THE U.S. NATURAL GAS CRISIS ON THE NORTH AMERICAN NITROGEN FERTILIZER INDUSTRY,&amp;#34; http://www.ieca-us.com/wp-content/uploads/072203Fertilizerbriefing.pdf~~]
Natural gas is the principal and only economically feasible feedstock raw material used for producing 
AND
must enact policies that stabilize the supply/demand balance for natural gas.

====US agriculture and food production is critical to prevent world food wars====
**Lugar 2000** (Richard, Chairman of the Senator Foreign Relations Committee and Member/Former Chair of the Senate Agriculture Committee, &amp;#34;Plant power&amp;#34; http://www.unep.org/OurPlanet/imgversn/143/lugar.html)
In a world confronted by global terrorism, turmoil in the Middle East, burgeoning 
AND
research will generate the innovations that will be necessary to feed the world.

====Third is the Green Economy,====

====Green economy key to address climate change – feed-in tariffs solve through investment and can meet the global energy demand====
**Kofetsky 2008,** &amp;#34;DEUTSCHLAND OBER ALLES: WHY GERMAN REGULATIONS NEED TO CONQUER THE DIVIDED U.S. RENEWABLE-ENERGY FRAMEWORK TO SAVE CLEAN TECH (AND THE WORLD)&amp;#34;, https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v%26pid=gmail%26attid=0.1%26thid=13955f78a3a8375d%26mt=application/pdf%26url=https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ui%3D2%26ik%3Db62fd2ee4a%26view%3Datt%26th%3D13955f78a3a8375d%26attid%3D0.1%26disp%3Dsafe%26zw%26sig=AHIEtbRX3GpQtnAMY29zWdsBnFGFuWibbA
Global warming., threats to energy Security, and rising energy costs have become unavoidable 
AND
are dim for advancing clean tech to sufficiently meet the current energy concerns.

====FITs has the opportunity to provide three million US jobs directly and indirectly====
**World Future Council 2011, &amp;#34;Feed-In Tariffs – A guide to one of the world~’s best environmental policies Boosting Energy for our Future&amp;#34;, http://www.worldfuturecouncil.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Maja/Feed-in_Tariffs_WFC.pdf**
How many jobs can RE create? The German FIT legislation has been instrumental in 
AND
needs, will have a great opportunity to benefit from this new industry.


====Ability to export renewables is the cornerstone of American economic recovery====
**Jenkins 2011**, Jesse, &amp;#34;Director of Energy and Climate Policy, Breakthrough Institute&amp;#34;, http://energy.nationaljournal.com/2011/10/is-america-losing-the-clean-en.php~~%232102285
There are a host of reasons why targeted policies and smart public investments in emerging 
AND
Making clean energy cheap and fully competitive should become our nation~’s rallying focus.

====Economic stagnation leads to nuclear war.====
Merlini, Senior Fellow – Brookings, 11 ~~[Cesare Merlini, nonresident senior fellow 
AND
-Secular World?  Survival, 53:2, 117 – 130~~]
Two neatly opposed scenarios for the future of the world order illustrate the range of 
AND
theocratic absolutes, competing or converging with secular absolutes such as unbridled nationalism.

====Global economic crises cause war — strong statistic support====
**Royal, ~’10** (Jedediah, Director of Cooperative Threat Reduction Program — DOD, Economics of War %26 Peace: Legal and Political Perspectives, ed. Goldsmith %26 Brauer, p. 213-15)
Less intuitive is how periods of economic decline may increase the likelihood of external conflict
AND
such, the view presented here should be considered ancillary to those views.

====CO2 independently causes extinction====
**Westenskow 8.** (Rosalie, UPI Correspondent, United Press International, &amp;#34;Acidic oceans may tangle food chain.&amp;#34; 06/06/08. [[http://www.upi.com/Energy_Resources/2008/06/06/Acidic_oceans_may_tangle_food_chain/UPI-84651212763771/print/-http://www.upi.com/Energy_Resources/2008/06/06/Acidic_oceans_may_tangle_food_chain/UPI-84651212763771/print/]])
**citing Scott Doney, PhD from MIT in Chemistry, AND CITING, David Adamec, head of Ocean Sciences at NASA with a PhD in Meteorology from Naval Postgraduate School
Increased carbon levels in ocean water could have devastating impacts on marine life, scientists 
AND
one year, potentially leading to extinction for some species, Adamec said.

====Warming causes extinction ====
Morgan, 2009  ~~[Dennis Ray, Professor of Current Affairs @ Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, South Korea, &amp;#34;World on fire: two scenarios of the destruction of human civilization and possible extinction of the human race&amp;#34;, Futures, Volume 41, Issue 10, December 2009, Pages 683-693, ScienceDirect~~]
As horrifying as the scenario of human extinction by sudden, fast-burning nuclear 
AND
Russian roulette while time increasingly stacks the cards against our chances of survival?


===Grids===

====Grid centralization ensures energy disruptions through accidents, storms, energy trading, and cyber terror.====
Hildyard et al 12 Nicholas, The Corner House, Larry Lohmann and Sarah Sexton.12 Energy Security For Whom? For What? February 2012, http://www.thecornerhouse.org.uk/sites/thecornerhouse.org.uk/files/Energy%20Security%20For%20Whom%20For%20What.pdf
By the same token, the more that an energy system is subjected to centralised 
AND
of generators magnify such &amp;#34;cyber-security&amp;#34; and data protection challenges.

====FITS solves 2 ways:====

====1. Distributed Generation—insulates the grid from power shortages.====
Miguel Mendonça et al 9. Miguel Mendonça. Researcher, author and advocate 
AND
: The Feed-in Tariff Handbook, p. 112-8)
To penalize renewables for their variability or intermittency not only ignores how that variability can 
AND
the more stable the grid becomes, rather than the other way around.


====Independently, Susceptibility of our grid makes cyber-attacks likely in the near term====
Copelin 12 (Laylan,Austin American-Statesman &amp;#34;Growing threat to utilities weighed&amp;#34; May 25, 2012 Lexis)
U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul on Thursday huddled behind closed doors with 
AND
all other sectors, it deserves special and urgent attention,&amp;#34; he said.


====Modernization of the grid deters attacks and prevents attacks effectiveness====
NETL 7 (National Energy Technology Laboratory for the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability, &amp;#34;MODERN GRID BENEFITS&amp;#34; August 2007 http://www.netl.doe.gov/smartgrid/referenceshelf/whitepapers/Modern%20Grid%20Benefits_Final_v1_0.pdf)
SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED VULNERABILITY TO TERRORIST ATTACK AND NATURAL DISASTERS A Center for Contemporary Conflict white 
AND
increased resistance to attack makes it better able to cope with natural disasters. 


====Successful cyber-attack on the grid would cause US lash out triggering nuclear war ====
Habiger, 2/1/2010 (Eugue – Retired Air Force General, Cyberwarfare and Cyberterrorism, The Cyber Security Institute, p. 11-19)
However, there are reasons to believe that what is going on now amounts to 
AND
based defenses, making us significantly more at risk of a major war.

====Second, Blackouts cause nuclear meltdown====
Capiello 11 (Dina, Huffington Post, &amp;#34;Long Blackouts Pose Risk To U.S. Nuclear Reactors&amp;#34; 3/29/11 http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/03/29/blackout-risk-us-nuclear-reactors_n_841869.html
A 2003 federal analysis looking at how to estimate the risk of containment failure said 
AND
things in a place that would not have been swept away by tsunami.&amp;#34; 

====Nuclear Meltdown causes Extinction====
Lendmen 11 (Stephen, &amp;#34;Nuclear Meltdown in Japan&amp;#34; 3/13/11 http://rense.com/general93/nucmelt.htm)
For years, Helen Caldicott warned it~’s coming. In her 1978 book, &amp;#34;
