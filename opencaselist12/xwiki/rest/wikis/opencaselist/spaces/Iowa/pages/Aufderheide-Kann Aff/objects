Cust and Pat.Ap. 1946. The word “substantially” in claim of application for patent for a mine ventilator for a motor and switch in a substantially complete enclosure did not mean the same word as “essentially”, but was a relative term to be interpreted in accordance with context.
 4. Their interpretation is arbitrary – neg teams can just find a definition for any percentage that happens to exclude the aff.
 5. We preserve predictability – all topic literature is about whether certain changes will be made to incentives, not about how much of a percentage increase will ensue.
 6. They kill aff ground – reforming existing policies is not topical under their interpretation because that requires a qualitative, legal change.
 7. Percentage tests are arbitrary, and courts have abandoned them because they obscure complex issues in favor of numbers.

1AC – Wake
Advantage 1
The Grid
Increased centralization raising blackout risks
Hildyard et al ‘12 (Nicholas, The Corner House - U.K. research and advocacy group focusing on human rights, the environment, and development, Larry Lohmann and Sarah Sexton.12 Energy Security For Whom? For What? February 2012, http://www.thecornerhouse.org.uk/sites/thecornerhouse.org.uk/files/Energy%20Security%20For%20Whom%20For%20What.pdf)

By the same token, the more that an energy system is subjected to centralised 
AND
of generators magnify such “cyber-security” and data protection challenges.
That makes economic collapse inevitable
Jagdfeld ’12 (Aaron, President and CEO of Generac Power Systems, “India-Style Blackout Could Strike The U.S.” Forbes, 8/6, http://www.forbes.com/sites/deborahljacobs/2012/08/06/india-style-blackout-could-strike-the-u-s/)

More people in the United States were affected by power outages last year than at 
AND
we cannot bear. Meantime, we should prepare for the next outage.
Stats prove—crises cause conflict 
Royal &amp;#39;10 (Jedediah, Director of Cooperative Threat Reduction Program ~-~- DOD, Economics of War and Peace: Legal and Political Perspectives, ed. Goldsmith and Brauer, p. 213-15)

Less intuitive is how periods of economic decline may increase the likelihood of external conflict
AND
such, the view presented here should be considered ancillary to those views.
They go nuclear
Merlini, Senior Fellow – Brookings, 11 Cesare Merlini, nonresident senior fellow at the Center on the United States and Europe and chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Italian Institute for International Affairs (IAI) in Rome. He served as IAI president from 1979 to 2001. Until 2009, he also occupied the position of executive vice chairman of the Council for the United States and Italy, which he co-founded in 1983. His areas of expertise include transatlantic relations, European integration and nuclear non-proliferation, with particular focus on nuclear science and technology. A Post-Secular World?  Survival, 53:2, 117 – 130

Two neatly opposed scenarios for the future of the world order illustrate the range of 
AND
theocratic absolutes, competing or converging with secular absolutes such as unbridled nationalism.
Susceptible grid makes short-term cyber attacks likely
Copelin ‘12 (Laylan, Austin American-Statesman “Growing threat to utilities weighed” May 25, 2012 Lexis)

U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul on Thursday huddled behind closed doors with 
AND
all other sectors, it deserves special and urgent attention,&amp;#34; he said.
This causes a US lash-out—triggers nuclear war
Habiger 2/1/10 (Eugue – Retired Air Force General, Cyberwarfare and Cyberterrorism, The Cyber Security Institute, p. 11-19)

However, there are reasons to believe that what is going on now amounts to 
AND
based defenses, making us significantly more at risk of a major war.
Blackouts cause nuclear meltdowns
Capiello ‘11 (Dina, Huffington Post, “Long Blackouts Pose Risk To U.S. Nuclear Reactors” 3/29/11 http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/03/29/blackout-risk-us-nuclear-reactors_n_841869.html)

A 2003 federal analysis looking at how to estimate the risk of containment failure said 
AND
things in a place that would not have been swept away by tsunami.&amp;#34; 
Extinction
Lendman ‘11 (Stephen – BA from Harvard University and MBA from Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, “Nuclear Meltdown in Japan” 3/13/11 http://rense.com/general93/nucmelt.htm)

For years, Helen Caldicott warned it&amp;#39;s coming. In her 1978 book, &amp;#34;
AND
or face extinction. No one listened. The Doomsday Clock keeps ticking.
Feed-In Tariffs solve, three reasons:
1. Distributed generation evens pressure on the grid
Mendonça et al ‘09 (Miguel, Researcher, author and advocate of sustainability and resilience strategies, David Jacobs is a researcher and PhD candidate at the Environmental Policy Research Centre in Berlin (FFU) focusing on support mechanisms for renewable electricity, and Dr. Benjamin K.

(Powering the Green Economy: The Feed-in Tariff Handbook, p. 112-8)

To penalize renewables for their variability or intermittency not only ignores how that variability can 
AND
the more stable the grid becomes, rather than the other way around.
2. Grid efficiency creates lower costs overall
Masterson ‘10 (Crystal D., Third Year student at University of Oklahoma College of Law, American Indian Law Review, “Wind-Energy Ventures in Indian Country: Fashioning a Functional Paradigm.” 2010. 34 Am. Indian L. Rev. 317 Lexis)

The feed-in tariffs require that every utility connect and give priority to all 
AND
renewable energy&amp;#34; n265 and the potential for less expensive electricity altogether. n266
3. FITS lead to energy storage development
Behles ‘12 (Deborah, Associate Professor of Law and Clinical Staff Attorney, Environmental Law and Justice Clinic, Golden Gate University School of Law. William and Mary Environmental Law and Policy Review, “An Integrated Green Urban Electrical Grid,” Spring 2012, 36 Wm. and Mary Envtl. L. and Pol&amp;#39;y Rev. 671 Lexis)

To provide an economic incentive to overcome the barrier of the initial capital cost, 
AND
of resources on the new urban green grid such as energy storage. n233
This allows for successful back-up power generation
Licata 8/8/12 (John, is the founder and chief energy strategist for Blue Phoenix Inc., an independent research and consulting company focused on clean energy “Commentary: How the U.S. can avoid a blackout like India&amp;#39;s” http://money.cnn.com/2012/08/08/news/economy/blackout-india/index.htm)

I really enjoy the summertime. Yet I&amp;#39;m worried. Another heat wave is forecast 
AND
to remember that we can&amp;#39;t remain a superpower if our lights aren&amp;#39;t on. 

Plan
The United States federal government should establish a feed-in tariff that creates long-term purchase contracts for new qualifying facilities in the United States that use wind and solar power for energy production to ensure a reasonable rate of return.

Advantage 2
Warming
Natural gas causing fast warming and methane release now – renewables key to solve
Nordhaus and Shellenberger ‘12 (Ted Nordhaus and Michael Shellenberger 12 are the authors of Break Through: From the Death of Environmentalism to the Politics of Possibility, Feb 27 (http://e360.yale.edu/feature/nordhaus_shellenberger_beyond_cap_and_trade_a_new_path_to_clean_energy/2499/)

A funny thing happened while environmentalists were trying and failing to cap carbon emissions in 
AND
fossil fuels. There simply is no substitute for making clean energy cheap.
Action now key to avoid extinction from warming – systemic causation renders typical threat calculus useless.
Lakoff 10/30/12 (George, Professor at the University of California – Berkeley and author of The Political Mind, “Global Warming Systemically Caused Hurricane Sandy,” Huffington Post, http://www.huffingtonpost.com/george-lakoff/sandy-climate-change_b_2042871.html)
