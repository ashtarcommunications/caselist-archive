AND&#xD;
compelling reasons for an audience to perform the future action that you propose.&#xD;
&#xD;
**Reasons to prefer—**&#xD;
**1. Fairness:**&#xD;
 &#xD;
A. Predictable limits—there are limitless investigations of energy production and debate practice, but the grammar of the resolution is based on enacting a policy. We can~’t predict the infinite number of critical positions the aff allows because they are disconnected from the resolutional question of demands for government action.&#xD;
&#xD;
B. Ground—their framework makes stable ground impossible because they can always claim ~’critical~’ outweigh disads to the plan or shift their advocacy to avoid impact turns—must hold them to a central question for productive argumentation and idea testing to occur.  &#xD;
&#xD;
**2. Education:**&#xD;
A. Switch-side testing—changing the ballot from a yes/no question about desirability of the plan undermines effective argumentation because there is no point of stasis to continually re-interrogate, removing the ability to test their ideas and others. &#xD;
**And, this idea testing is the best model for creating understanding and fostering tolerance. **&#xD;

&#xD;
**B. Stasis—**&#xD;
1. Subject Formation—absence of shared yardsticks for argument and the mismatch of interpretational scope limits out the possibility of debate.&#xD;
Diana **Panke** 20**10** (Lecturer of Politics at the University College Dublin, Review of International Studies, Volume 36, Issue 01, January 2010 p. 145-168) &#xD;
&#xD;
Discourses take place in many political, judicial and societal arenas within and beyond nation&#xD;
AND&#xD;
reasoning whose interpretational scope fit the interpretational scope of the problem at stake.&#xD;

&#xD;
2. Ideational Change—no chance of ideational change in their framework—lack of agreement over truth or between competing paradigms eliminates discussion.&#xD;

Judicial discourses accelerate argumentative speech acts. Yet, exchanging arguments is not sufficient to &#xD;

Are new concepts introduced? How are they defined? Are exceptions specified?&#xD;

**Freely**, professor of communication and director of debate at John Carroll, 66&#xD;
(Austin J, Argumentation and debate: rational decision making, 2nd edition, p. 14)&#xD;
Debate may be classified into two broad categories: substantive and educational. Substantive debate is conducted on propositions in which the advocates have a special interest; the debate is presented before a judge or audience with power to render a binding decision on the proposition; and the purpose of debate is to establish a fact, value, or policy.  Educational debate is conducted on propositions in which the advocates usually have an academic interest.; it is presented&#xD;
before a judge or audience usually without direct power to render a decision on the proposition—indeed, in educational debate the judge is instructed to disregard the merits of the proposition and to render a decision on the merits of the debate; and the purpose of the debate is to provide educational opportunities for the participants.&#xD;

====Interpretation – Financial incentives directly increase government expenditures for energy production – R%26D is support.====&#xD;

Even if it made no sense to limit the clause to takings &amp;#34;for public &#xD;

no doubt that the phrase is narrowing the scope of the Amendment. n20&#xD;

**EIA 7** (Energy Information Administration, &amp;#34;Federal Energy Research and Development,&amp;#34; http://www.eia.gov/oiaf/servicerpt/subsidy2/pdf/chap3.pdf) &#xD;

The central political task of the intellectuals is to aid in the construction of a &#xD;

====They necessitate destructive dichotomies which assures violence, they adherence to  grammatical rules make rhizomatic politics impossible
Schantz 9 (ORLA SCHANTZ writes for the enlightenment underground, &amp;#34;The Urdoxa of Personal Pronouns&amp;#34; Donnie) http://enlightenmentunderground.blogspot.com/2009/03/urdoxa-of-personal-pronouns_28.html-http://enlightenmentunderground.blogspot.com/2009/03/urdoxa-of-personal-pronouns_28.html

Grammar has always been the fearful guardian against the chaos of language, the general commanding the unruly troops. A system of indoctrination, created by meticulous bureaucrats in the service of the State (clergy, literati, linguistic accountants, and pedants). Grammar is not to be believed, but to be obeyed. In education when a teacher explains the rules, no information is communicated, instead orders are given. If language is water, grammar is ice. The personal pronouns as graphic entities came relatively late in Indo-European languages, but have since reigned supreme. And along with it the subject became the Cartesian king. And the object the ambitious prince, always trying to usurp the power of the throne. However, when the first homo sapiens spied a member of a different tribe, he cried out and defined the fatal creation of The Other. The dualism between, the attraction and enmity of the two have since bedeviled thinking, always creating destructive dichotomies. Squeezed in in the space, left open, the verb insisted on its rightful place as the doer. It meant action. The verb also came in Harlequin clothing with many patchworks of colors. One of them threatened the subject: the infinitive. Verbs in the infinitive have the courage to challenge the hierarchical power structure. True revolutionaries%21 No longer is &amp;#34;the subject&amp;#34; the dictator, and no more can &amp;#34;the object&amp;#34; claim its right as heir apparent. In fact, verbs in the infinitive are limitless becomings, blissfully ignoring the personal pronoun of the subject. Infinite-becomings have no &amp;#34;fathers&amp;#34;, only referring to an &amp;#34;it&amp;#34; of the event = it is raining - or thinking. Infinitives are too busy becoming, too action-orientated, too much process, too few (if any) products. Becomings which both await the missing subject and precede it. Thinking in the infinitive means transcending personal pronouns. To die, to live, to love, to ponder, to do. Never-ending flux and flows. Personal pronouns breed opposition, the dreaded cul-de-sacs of discussion which never finds its way, always losing direction and purpose. Personal pronouns demand numbers: three of them. Singular and plural. What about a fourth or more? Grammar is Stalinistic and tolerates no insurgents or dissidents, yet this is what it needs to survive outside of the Gulag. Where Urdoxa provides &amp;#34;stable entities&amp;#34; out in the world that corresponds to distinct faculties, paradox points to the unstable character of the relationship of language and world. Representation is exactly this: a second version: a RE of what is presented, and consequently a fraud of a fraud. Language is always more than language. Or better, language is always more than representation. It spills over into the world, woven, as it is, into the world in order to be able to function as representation. This quilt requires paradoxes of sense and nonsense that escape the grasp of language. But personal pronouns don~’t care, having secured their place in human communication. There is no escape. And so, dualisms fester like virus when they could thrive as rhizomes.====

====Removing state jurisdiction is controversial====
**Dotten and Jones 09   energy attorneys, Seattle and Portland**
Mike and Steve, http://www.martenlaw.com/newsletter/20090310-transmission-siting-battle


====As alternative energy development accelerates, the need for additional transmission capacity will also increase. The question is not whether there is a need for new transmission capacity, but rather, who will fulfill the demand, and whether the states or the federal government will be responsible for the siting and environmental review associated with those projects. State vs. Federal Authority for Siting Transmission Lines Prior to 2005, state utility officials were the only regulators with authority to site electric transmission lines. However, increasing concerns over a transmission grid that is an interconnected patchwork of state-authorized facilities led Congress to adopt the Energy Policy Act of 2005.~~6~~ The 2005 Energy Policy Act considerably changed the dynamic by authorizing the Secretary of Energy to designate National Interest Energy Transmission Corridors (&amp;#34;NIETC&amp;#34;) in &amp;#34;any geographic area that experiences electric energy transmission constraints or congestion that adversely affects consumers.&amp;#34;~~7~~ Under the Act, the federal government was granted authority to condemn private property for the acquisition of rights of way for transmission corridors. Condemnation authority is delegated to FERC. The Act requires that, prior to exercising condemnation authority, FERC must find: (1) that the state where the transmission lines are to be constructed lacks authority to approve the siting of the facilities or to consider interstate benefits; (2) that the applicant for the construction of the transmission line does not provide retail service in the state were the line is to be constructed; (3) that the state siting authority has failed to approve the application within one year; or (4) that it has attached conditions that will prevent congestion reduction or make the new line economically infeasible.~~8~~ This shift in the balance from state to federal oversight has been a lightening rod for debate at both levels. In their meeting last month in Washington, the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners ~~NARUC~~ rejected a draft resolution recommending that the group not oppose amendments to the Federal Power Act that would give transmission siting oversight to federal regulators for new interstate transmission lines. Despite the failure of the resolution, NARUC~’s president Frederick Butler said that the group is &amp;#34;having a very healthy discussion on the role of the states versus the role of the federal government. We realize that the federal government may have an interest in a larger responsibility here, but the role of the states must be preserved to the maximum extent possible. And certainly the states are in a better position to play on whether transmission should be built and how much of it should be built because there is a tension between transmission and other forms of dealing with the problem, like renewable energy and distributed generation local to load service.&amp;#34;~~9~~ The issue is also high on the Obama administration~’s agenda. National energy and climate czar Carol Browner stated that &amp;#34;some sort of inter-agency siting team&amp;#34; is being considered as a &amp;#34;one stop&amp;#34; means of siting transmission lines.~~10~~ Browner~’s statement came at a meeting of Western governors, many of whom support a more uniform federal policy for siting and building a national energy grid.~~11~~====

For our purposes, a few brief observations suffice to dispel most of the force

¶ Instead, more likely, the Court will try to issue narrower rulings.   
AND
But how he’ll write the opinion is impossible to know at this point.



==2NC- Kennedy Thinks Capital Zero Sum==

Kennedy believes in “institutional capital” model
Bragaw and Perry 2002 (Assistant Gov&amp;#39;t Prof ~-~- Sweet Briar College and Gov&amp;#39;t Professor ~-~- Sweet Briar, 13 Stan. L. and Pol&amp;#39;y Rev 19)

Kennedy, who at this point had already testified for half an hour before the 
AND
search for that voice and to make sure you&amp;#39;re doing what&amp;#39;s neutral.&amp;#34; 98


Court capital will have to be invested for gay marriage—it’s zero sum
James Esseks 11/7/2012 (Director for the ACLU LGBTQ and AIDS project, &amp;#34;A Marriage Moment (and Another One to Come) www.aclu.org/blog/lgbt-rights/marriage-moment-and-another-one-come)

Although judges are sworn to uphold the Constitution, they do not decide cases in 
AND
not seen as an imposition on an unwilling public by an unelected judiciary.”

He’s the deciding vote
Nan Hunter 2/7/2013 (Writer for the Williams Institute, &amp;#34;Is the supreme court argument over gay marriage really all about straight people?&amp;#34; williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/headlines/is-the-supreme-court-argument-over-gay-marriage-really-all-about-straight-people/)

In the end, of course, it will boil down to the nine Justices

pretty good bet that he will get the last word on marriage too.

Kennedy will decide on federalism grounds 
Beth Hawkins 12/17/2012 (Writer for the Minnesota Post, &amp;#34;How might Supreme Court justices view the gay-marriage issues before them?&amp;#34; www.minnpost.com/politics-policy/2012/12/how-might-supreme-court-justices-view-gay-marriage-issues-them)

Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ruth Bader Ginsburg make up the

And they may not reach the merits of the first case at all.

That’ll require court capital 
Ducoff 1998 (Fall, 30 Rutgers L. J. 209)

Perhaps Professor Choper&amp;#39;s most interesting and persuasive justifications for abrogating the Court&amp;#39;s responsibility to decide 
AND
, rather than Congress, receives substantial backlash after affirming Congress&amp;#39; actions.  n166




==A2- Winners Win==

History proves that Capital can only be finite.
Choper, 80 (Law School Dean – Berkeley, Judicial Review and the National Political Process, p. 162-3)
Therefore, if the question of whether the Court gain or loses enforcement capacity by 
AND
American public emerges as profoundly indifferent to liberties long established and presumably noncontroversial.”
Court capital is always finite – losers mobilize faster and capital is hard to restore. 
Adamany, ’80 (CSU – Long Beach, Western Political Quarterly, pg. 592)
In protecting individual rights, the Supreme Court is limited by the “fragile character
AND
needs: Congress can refuse the President’s programs and he can veto theirs.

==Overrule Link==

Overrules drain Court capital.
Yoo, 01 (Law Prof – Berkeley, Summer, 68 U. Chi. L. Rev. 775)
How does the Court maintain this legitimacy? According to the Casey plurality, the 
AND
following standards of procedural justice or by making decisions that follow principled rules.
Overrules hurt the Court’s legitimacy and cause political outrage against the Court.
Young, 02 (Assistant law Prof – UT, Fall, 73 U. Colo. L. Rev. 1139)
Courts may also be criticized as activist when they depart from the authority of judicial

**Albertsworth,** 19**21 **(Harvard Law Review, Vol. 35, No. 2, Dec., 1921, pp. 127-153)
As the authority of administrative bodies depends largely on statutes, their action in any

Presidents have an incentive to use their time in the White House to cement their

===Overview===

===Uniqueness===

====Pass now – momentum.====
**Sunshine State News 3/28**/13, http://www.sunshinestatenews.com/blog/obama-promises-immigration-reform-soon-hispanics-telemundo-univision

President Barack Obama, the ever-present campaigner, took his push for immigration 
AND
Hispanic electorate, this could be the year the heavy lift gets done.

====Strong public support.====
Jon **Terbush 3/28**, is a staff writer for TheWeek.com covering politics, sports and other things he finds interesting. He~’s previously written for Talking Points Memo, Raw Story, and Business Insider. http://theweek.com/article/index/242064/even-a-majority-of-republicans-support-legalizing-undocumented-workers

A broad majority of Americans believe the government should allow undocumented immigrants to legally remain 
AND
that a slightly smaller 53 percent majority of Americans supported a citizenship path.

====Disputes are resolvable.====
David **Yonkman 3/28**/13, Washington Correspondent http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/sessions-leahy-immigration-reform/2013/03/28/id/496793
Negotiations with the eight senators were left in limbo last Friday as Congress went into 
AND
it done certainly before the end of the summer,&amp;#34; Obama told Telemundo.

===AT: Capital Irrelevant===

====Obama has leverage – quotes internal White House staff.====
Amie **Parnes and** Justin **Sink 3/20**/13, The Hill, http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/289179-obama-honeymoon-may-be-over

The White House disputes any notion that Obama has lost any political capital in recent 
AND
It looks like immigration is closer ~~to passage~~ than ever before.&amp;#34;

====Statements from Republicans prove Obama~’s support is crucial.====
**FirstRead 2-28**
~~NBC News~’ Politics Analysis Blog, &amp;#34;First Thoughts: Sequester fight already taking a toll&amp;#34; http://firstread.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/02/27/17117063-first-thoughts-sequester-fight-already-taking-a-toll?lite-http://firstread.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/02/27/17117063-first-thoughts-sequester-fight-already-taking-a-toll?lite~~

*** John %26 Lindsey~’s Excellent Meeting: Why does immigration reform still look like the 
AND
immigration, because we also have learned the sequester standoff also came up.

====Political capital is still key—-Obama~’s leading negotiations with the GOP====
**AFP 2/19** &amp;#34;Obama courts key Republicans on immigration reform,&amp;#34; 2013, Factiva
US President Barack Obama on Tuesday called key Senate Republicans, with whom he is 
AND
certified as secure.¶ Obama has so far declined to make that linkage.

====Obama has leverage now—-he~’ll get what he wants on immigration specifically====
**Goddard 2/21** Taegan is a politics expert and founder of The Political Wire. &amp;#34;It~’s actually the Republicans who are overreaching,&amp;#34; 2013, http://theweek.com/article/index/240414/its-actually-the-republicans-who-are-overreaching-http://theweek.com/article/index/240414/its-actually-the-republicans-who-are-overreaching
I~’ve argued before that President Obama is not overreaching on his ambitious second-term 
AND
position right now and President Obama is using it to his political advantage.

===Barker 11===

====Federalism super popular====
Murphy 3/5. (Sean, Huffington Post.  &amp;#34;States~’ Rights Bills Surge in GOP-Controlled States After Obama Re-election.&amp;#34; 3/5/13. http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/05/states-rights_n_2813469.html?utm_hp_ref=politics-http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/05/states-rights_n_2813469.html?utm_hp_ref=politics
While provocative bills aren~’t particularly unusual in state legislatures, so many have been offered 
AND
, dozens of bills have been introduced to nullify federal firearms laws alone.

===Compartmentalization===
Issues aren~’t compartmentalized – policy failures prevent future legislative successes – political capital is key to overcome opposition
Silber 7 – Political Science phd Student at UF (November 2007, Marissa, &amp;#34;What makes a president quack? Understanding lame duck status through the eyes of the media and politicians&amp;#34;, from paper Prepared for delivery at the 2007 Annual Meeting of the American Political Science Association, August 30th-September 2nd 2007, http://74.125.155.132/scholar?q=cache:bbkJmVQ3SJMJ:scholar.google.com/+%22political+capital%22+%22finite%22+resources+president%26hl=en%26as_sdt=80000000) MGM
	
Political capital, based on external resources &amp;#34;determines whether the President will have the 
AND
of political capital make it difficult for a President to get anything done.
A lame duck President is plagued by past policy failures, while not benefiting as much from policy successes (Dunn 2006). George Bush has been plagued by his lack of response to Hurricane Katrina and first term foreign policies after 9/11 to deal with the War on Terrorism (Dunn 2006). Past Presidents have also been plagued by both domestic and foreign policy failures, affecting both party and public support.
Party support is the chief ingredient in Presidential capital; even if public approval ratings 
AND
,&amp;#34; the 1960 election showed that the Democrats~’ strategy was successful (281).
Public approval and electoral margin are not solely independent factors for political capital, but 
AND
begins to have substantial impact in eroding legislative support&amp;#34; (Light 29).
Reputation~’s effect on a President~’s political capital is unclear. Neustadt argues it is really important, using Eisenhower has an example to show this. According to Neustadt:
Everything ~~the President~~ personally says and does (or fails to say, omits to do), becomes significant in everyone~’s appraisals regardless of the claims of his officialdom. For his words, his own actions, provide clues not only to his personal proclivities but to the forecasts and asserted influence of those around him (Neustadt 68).
While Neustadt argues that reputation is important, Carter and Nixon staff assistants suggest that 
AND
is attributable to the speed of the investigative process&amp;#34; (Dunn 2006).
Important to the discussion of political capital is whether or not it can be replenished 
AND
determining this, a definition of a lame duck President must be developed.

===GOP doesn~’t like PC===

====Concessions embolden Republicans – won~’t help Obama.====
Eric **Boehlert 1/11**, Media Matters for America, http://readersupportednews.org/opinion2/276-74/15505-hagel-republicans-and-the-farce-of-beltway-journalism

Meanwhile, most of the Beltway pundits who have chastised Obama for failing to &amp;#34;
AND
GOP~’s cabinet blowback was routine. Obama just can~’t win with that crowd.


====Dem~’s key to immigration – unified support key to passage – empirically they can abandon him.====
**AP 2/7**, http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/02/07/obama-to-promote-agenda-to-house-dems/

President Obama is promoting his second-term agenda to House Democrats, eager to 
AND
including a path to citizenship for the nation~’s estimated 11 million illegal immigrants.

====Democratic unity is key to steamroll Republicans====
**Chowdhury**, writer for the Daily Times, **1/24**/2013
(Sabria Balland, &amp;#34;Obama: second term and potential Republican opposition,&amp;#34; Lexis)
Immigration promises to be a significant issue in Obama~’s second term. One constituency, 
AND
as it did over the fiscal cliff battle over tax rates in December.

===AT: No PC===

====Not true – he is behind the scenes.====
JULIE **PACE 3/27**, AP White House Correspondent, http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2013/mar/27/obama-immigration-bill-could-pass-by-summer/

In an effort to keep Republicans at the negotiation table, Obama has stayed relatively 
AND
Congress returns from a two-week recess the week of April 8.

====Obama pressuring law makers now.====
**Woodruff and Murray 3/25**, PBS NewsHour http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/politics/jan-june13/immigration_03-25.html

JUDY WOODRUFF: You mentioned earlier the White House has language. They have a 
AND
the table, then, hey, I~’m stepping in and taking over.

====Obama is putting the pressure on now.====
**Woodruff and Murray 3/25**, PBS NewsHour http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/politics/jan-june13/immigration_03-25.html

JUDY WOODRUFF: So, the president calling on Congress to finish the job. 
AND
that says, hey, guys, make sure you~’re still doing that.
