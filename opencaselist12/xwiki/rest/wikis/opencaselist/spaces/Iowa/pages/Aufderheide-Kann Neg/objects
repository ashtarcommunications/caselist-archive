A.  INTERPRETATION.  A restriction must actually prevent production, not just indirectly make it more difficult.  Legal interpretations in the context of a similar kind of regulation support.

New York Court of Appeals Chief Justice Pound in 33
Roscoe, Nebbia v. New York, 262 N.Y 259, 264, lexis
The fixing of minimum prices is one of the main features of the act. 
AND
State interference as to the price at which he shall sell his milk.

He continues New York Court of Appeals Chief Justice Pound in 33
Roscoe, Nebbia v. New York, 262 N.Y 259, 271, lexis
The New York law creates no monopoly; does not restrict production; was adopted to meet an emergency; milk is a greater family necessity than ice.

US Supreme Court Justice Roberts in 34 
(Owen, Majority opinion in Nebbia v. New York, 291 U.S. 502, 531, http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=usandvol=291andinvol=502
Notwithstanding the admitted power to correct existing economic ills by appropriate regulation of business, 
AND
maladjustments by legislation touching prices? We think there is no such principle.

B.  VIOLATION Choose one}
VIOLATION The plan removes a regulation on natural gas producers that is designed to protect oceans.  This is not a restriction on natural gas production; producers can still produce as much gas by fracking as they want and take their chances on proper disclosure.

C.  REASONS TO PREFER.

1. Limits. 
Their interpretation opens aff case choice to changing anything that might discourage energy production.  They could improve the European economy, or stop a war with Iran.  Unlimited case possibilities make negative preparation too difficult.  

2.  Ground
The aff interpretation allows them to claim too many advantages unrelated to increasing energy production, such as protection of trade secrets.  Fair ground division on this topic should be centered around increasing or decreasing energy production.  Our interpretation guarantees this.

3.  Bright line
Their interpretation requires that you look at the intent or effects of regulations rather than on the words.  Our interpretation sets a bright line  if the words of the law mandate a limit on energy production, then it is topical to remove it.  Avoiding subjective judging decisions is good for the exercise of jurisdiction.  Also, any advantages based on removing restrictions would be extratopical, not reasons to vote aff.

D.  TOPICALITY AND EXTRATOPICALITY ARE VOTERS.
For reasons of education, fairness and jurisdiction.

federal government has three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial. 
And, the agent of action test – The Aff has to specify in their plan text what is necessary for the plan to take effect.  Not specifying the branch doesn’t meet since the “USFG” isn’t an agent and there wouldn’t be a political channel to implement the plan.

A. Predictable limits—there are limitless investigations of energy production and debate practice, but the grammar of the resolution is based on enacting a policy. We can’t predict disconnected from the resolutional question.

B. Ground—they make stable ground impossible because they can always claim ‘critical’ outweigh disads to the plan or shift their advocacy to avoid impact turns—must hold them to a central question for productive argumentation and idea testing.

Presumption – the affirmative defends current restrictions on energy production, that’s a reason to maintain the status quo and vote neg

2. Education:

A. Switch-side testing—changing the ballot from a yes/no question about desirability of the plan undermines effective argumentation because there is no point of stasis to continually re-interrogate.

And, this idea testing is the best model for creating understanding and fostering tolerance. 
Gordon Mitchell et al. 2007 (Eric English, Stephen Llano, Catherine E. Morrison, John Rief, and Carly Woods, Pitt Comm Studies Grad Students, Gordon Mitchell is an Associate Comm Studies Professor @ Pitt, Communication and Critical/Cultural Studies 4)

B. Stasis—

1.Subject Formation—absence of shared yardsticks for argument and the mismatch of interpretational scope limits out the possibility of debate.
Diana Panke 2010 (Lecturer of Politics at the University College Dublin, Review of International Studies, Volume 36, Issue 01, January 2010 p. 145-168)

2. Ideational Change—no chance of ideational change in their framework—lack of agreement over truth or between competing paradigms eliminates discussion.
Diana Panke 2010 (Lecturer of Politics at the University College Dublin, Review of International Studies, Volume 36, Issue 01, January 2010 p. 145-168) 
Judicial discourses accelerate argumentative speech acts. Yet, exchanging arguments is not sufficient to

Are new concepts introduced? How are they defined? Are exceptions specified?

C. This is a voting issue—limiting discussion to the question being asked is a prerequisite to effective communication.
