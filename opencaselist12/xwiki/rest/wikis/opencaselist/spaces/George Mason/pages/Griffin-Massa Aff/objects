Plan: The United States Federal Government should fund the development of Small Modular Reactor (SMR) nuclear technology for the United States military.

Our first advantage is the military

The Harms:
First, Grid Reliance
Civilian grid failures put military electricity access at risk – it provides 99 percent of their power

Grid Vulnerability. … infrastructural systems.8

Second, Budget Tradeoffs
Lack of US energy security kills mission effectiveness – draws away focus from critical and strategic missions

No one needs to tell … they go hand in hand.

We have three impacts:
First, Military reliance on the civilian power provides an incentive for grid attack – kills military power projection AND causes nuclear war from escalatory conflicts

More recently, awareness … went offline.

Second, military readiness is key to prevent extinction

Deterring other … perhaps the reality—of the U.S. military structure

Third, US Power projection and hegemony is key to prevent numerous scenarios for global nuclear war

[Robert, Carnegie Senior Associate, “End of Dreams, Return of History” Policy Review, http://www.hoover.org/publications/policyreview/8552512.html#n10]jap

This is a good thing… involvement will provide an easier path. 

SMRs can supply power to military bases during times of crisis – deters grid attacks

Unlike other alternative … or war would be greatly reduced.

Having a reliable source of … power independent of the commercial grid [4].

SMR AFF – Nuclear Leadership Advantage – 1AC

The Harm:
Natural gas threatens US nuclear investment – allows for other countries to take the lead on nuclear initiatives. US must step up investment before natural gas fails

The timely implementation of … energy independence.

Nuclear energy leadership key to control of nonproliferation agreements, only players can change the game

US Nuclear power leadership solves proliferation and international nuclear accidents – increases reliance on US nuclear policies

Strategic Goal: Continued … expand these policies.

And the impact is nuclear war 
Proliferation guarantees massive nuclear escalation and war- deterrence fails

Worse still, in …or even whole nations
Solvency Page

Our last contention is the solvency page

First, DOD should install SMRs on military bases—catalyzes support for SMR and US leadership—ensures global spillover of SMR.

Problematically, despite the immense … support for nuclear energy

Second, Governmental intervention key for military SMR use – FOAK costs need to be allayed
