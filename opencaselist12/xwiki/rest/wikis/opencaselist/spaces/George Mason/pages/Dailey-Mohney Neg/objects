The drive for renewable energy plays into the capitalist drive for profits – planetary catastrophe is inevitable under capitalism regardless of whether we transition from oil to renewables.

====The aff should defend a topical plan. All advantages should be causal results of the plan.====


====Prefer our interpretation:====


====Grammar-====

====a. Federal Government refers to the national government.====
**Hartley ~’96**  (John, &amp;#34;American Civics&amp;#34;, p. 39, Google Print)

The term federal government refers to the national government, which is centered in Washington, D.C.


====b. Resolved means to enact by law====
Words and Phrases ~’64  (Permanent Edition)

Definition ofthe word &amp;#34;resolve,&amp;#34; given by Webster is &amp;#34;to express an opinion or determination by resolution or vote; as ~’it was resolved by the legislature;&amp;#34; It is of similar force to the word &amp;#34;enact,&amp;#34; which is defined by Bouvier as meaning &amp;#34;to establish by law&amp;#34;.


====They make debate Impossible – ====

====a. Ground- the federal government only stable basis for negground. If they aren~’t tied to defending it then it~’s unlikely we will have applicable research.====

====b. Limits- they allow any individual ideology, theory or cause to become an aff, which negates our ability to effectively research the aff. ====

====c. Extra T- The aff claims advantages that are unrelated to instrumental implementation, proves the resolution insufficient.  ====


====They hijack Education – Predictability is the basis of neg strategy, which is key to clash. The impact is rigorous testing of policies, which is the only way to truly understand the world and is key to value to life.====
Zappen ~’4  (James, Prof. Language and Literature – Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, &amp;#34;The Rebirth of Dialogue: Bakhtin, Socrates, and the Rhetorical Tradition&amp;#34;, p. 35-36)

Finally, Bakhtin describes the Socratic dialogue as a carnivalesque debate between opposing points of 
AND
in Soocrates~’ successive refutations and humiliations of Gorgias, Polus, and Callicles. 




====Switch-side debate creates tolerance for alternative viewpoints, which prevents moral dogmatism. ====
Muir ~’93 (Star, Prof. Comm. – George Mason U., Philosophy and Rhetoric, &amp;#34;A Defense of the Ethics of Contemporary Debate&amp;#34;, 26(4), pp. 288-290)

Values clarification, Stewart is correct in pointing out, does not mean that no 
AND
thinking, and in turn for the development of a reasoned moral identity. 



====They create a political vacuum that cements the status quo====
Cook ~’92 (Anthony, Associate Professor – Georgetown Law, New England Law Review, Spring, 26 New Eng.L. Rev. 751, Lexis)

The effect of deconstructing the power of the author to impose a fixed meaning on 
AND
those who influence us through their eloquence, prestige, wealth and power.



====It~’s a prior question. Without agreement on the subject debate is impossible.====
Shively ~’00 (Ruth Lessl, Former Assistant Prof. Pol. Sci. – Texas A%26M, in &amp;#34;Political Theory and Partisan Politics&amp;#34;, Ed. Portis, Gundersen and Shively, pp. 181-182)

The requirements given thus far are primarily negative. The ambiguists must say &amp;#34;no
AND
. In other words, contestation rests on some basic agreement or harmony. 


====Ontology must be secondary to the prior question of political practice====
**Jarvis ~’00** (Darryl, Senior Lecturer in International Relations – University of Sydney, International Relations and the Challenge of Postmodernism, p. 128-9)

More is the pity that such irrational and obviously abstruse debate should so occupy us

Ebert and Zavarzadeh in 2008(Teresa L., English, State University of New York, Albany, Mas~’ud, prolific writer and expert on class ideology, &amp;#34;Class in Culture&amp;#34;, p. 27-29)

Lukacs in 67 (George, Hungarian Marxist philosopher and literary critic. He is

Historical materialism has, therefore, a much greater value for the proletariat than that

• Molten salt - with or without dissolved fuel.

In the modern era, executive orders have gone from being a tool largely reserved for internal White House operations -deciding how to format agency budgets or creating outlines for diplomatic protocol — to a powerful weapon in defining, and expanding, executive power. In turn, presidents have increasingly used that power to construct and promote social policies on some of the country~’s most controversial issues, from civil rights to labor relations to reproductive health.
