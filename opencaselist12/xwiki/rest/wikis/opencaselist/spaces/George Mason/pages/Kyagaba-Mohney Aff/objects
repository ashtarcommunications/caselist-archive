Observation Two: Harms
Advantage One: Military

Military actions to reduce and change energy inputs fail – critical security obstacles prevent solutions

The DOD interest in small reactors derives largely from problems with base and logistics vulnerability
AND
through hostile territory to forward locations. Each of these is explored below.
We will isolate two internal links: First is Grid Vulnerability
Civilian grid failures put military electricity access at risk – it provides 99 percent of their power

Grid Vulnerability. DOD is unable to provide its bases with electricity when the civilian 
AND
and so forth, and demonstrated the interdependence of modern infrastructural systems.8

Independently, military reliance on the civilian power provides an incentive for grid attack – kills military power projection AND causes nuclear war from escalatory conflicts

More recently, awareness has been growing that the grid is also vulnerable to purposive 
AND
function for more than a few days after the civilian grid went offline.

SMRs can supply power to military bases during times of crisis – deters grid attacks

Unlike other alternative sources of energy, small re- actors have the potential to 
AND
also to provide critical services in surrounding towns during long-term outages.
Strategically, islanding bases with small reactors has another benefit. One of the main 
AND
in order to win an ongoing battle or war would be greatly reduced.



SMR’s key to maintain security of power grid – solves military vulnerabilities 
Baker, 6/22/2012
[Matthew, American Security Project, Do Small Modular Reactors Present a Serious Option for the Military’s Energy Needs?” http://americansecurityproject.org/blog/2012/do-small-modular-reactors-present-a-serious-option-for-the-militarys-energy-needs/ [Accessed 8/19/2012 DMW] 

SMRs are able to be constructed in factories, with manufacturing capabilities already available in 
AND
to Congressman Bartlett, SMRs could make such bases energy self-sufficient.


SMR key to military survivability
King, Huntzinger and Nguyen 2011
[Marcus King • LaVar Huntzinger • Thoi Nguyen, Feasibility of Nuclear Power on U.S. Military Installations, http://www.cna.org/sites/default/files/research/Nuclear%20Power%20on%20Military%20Installations%20D0023932%20A5.pdf]jap

Having a reliable source of electricity is critically important for many DoD installations. Fort 
AND
could provide years of electrical power independent of the commercial grid [4].


AND, the military is dependent upon energy technology. Efficiency measures and other alternative energies fail – only SMRs can provide enough power for the military to sustain itself and save troop lives

Operational Vulnerability. Operational energy use represents a second serious vulnerability for the U.
AND
the potential to save hundreds or thousands of U.S. lives.

Second Internal Link: Budget Tradeoffs
US military energy security key to mission effectiveness – allows focus on critical and strategic missions
Udall 2012
[Mark Udall, Democratic Senator from Colorado, May 22, 2012, Energy Security is National Security
http://energy.nationaljournal.com/2012/05/powering-our-military-whats-th.php]jap

No one needs to tell consumers about the importance of energy security. They see 
AND
and national security is a false choice – they go hand in hand.

Military readiness key to prevent extinction 
 [Martin, “The underfunded Pentagon,” Foreign Affairs, March/April]jap
Feldstein 7

Deterring other great powers, such as Russia and China, will require Washington 
AND
modern technology and the potential emergence of a black market in fissile material.
Furthermore, there seems to be general agreement that the United States has committed so 
AND
—and perhaps the reality—of the U.S. military structure



Heg prevents great power conflict, terrorism, and nuclear war – no alternatives – intervention is inevitable, only a question of effectiveness

Today the international situation is also one of high risk. • The terrorists who 
AND

Multipolarity inevitable , but US power soothes the transition that would otherwise cause extinction and is empirically correlated to perpetual great power peace

It is worth first examining the larger picture: We live in a time of 
AND
the 20th century, setting the stage for the Pacific Century now unfolding. 







Nuclear Leadership Advantage


Advantage Two: Nuclear Leadership


Nuclear investment increasing internationally 
Domenici and Miller 2012
[Senator Pete Domenici and Dr. Warren F. “Pete” Miller, former Department of Energy (DOE) Assistant Secretary for Nuclear Energy | July 2012, Maintaining U.S. Leadership in Global Nuclear Energy Markets, Bipartisan Policy Center, http://bipartisanpolicy.org/sites/default/files/Leadership%20in%20Nuclear%20Energy%20Markets.pdf]jap

Internationally, the outlook is quite different: a number of countries intend to grow 
AND
, global growth in nuclear energy is still expected to be positive overall.


We’ll isolate two internal links: First Is Negotiation Power

Nuclear energy leadership key to control of nonproliferation, only players can change the game
Wallace and Williams 2012
(Michael Wallace and Sarah Williams “Nuclear Energy in America: Preventing its Early Demise” 2012 http://csis.org/files/publication/120417_gf_wallace_williams.pdf)

Third, in the past, the U.S. government could exert influence 
AND
.S. nuclear industry and take ¶ action to prevent its early demise



US Nuclear power leadership solves proliferation and international nuclear accidents – increases reliance on US nuclear policies

Strategic Goal: Continued strong U.S. leadership in global nuclear security matters 
AND
technologies are sound and we support efforts to maintain and expand these policies.






Second internal link: First Mover 
SMR development key to nuclear tech leadership – puts US at front of evolving nuclear tech
Fleischmann 2011
[Congressman Chuck Fleischmann is a conservative Republican who represents the 3rd District of Tennessee. Small Modular Reactors Could Help With U.S. Energy Needs, http://www.aps.org/publications/capitolhillquarterly/201110/backpage.cfm]jap

The timely implementation of small reactors could position the United States on the cutting edge 
AND
taking the first steps in making significant headway to truly gaining energy independence.

US controlled SMR key to nonproliferation – proliferating countries will fill in the energy gap- causing cascading prolif

Third, there is a national security aspect to the development of ¶ U.
AND
suppliers that may not always share our ¶ approach toward safety and nonproliferation.
Prolif dramatically increases the risk of nuclear war ~-~- causes nuclear winter. 
Robock 10 
(Alan, Professor of Environmental Sciences at Rutgers University, editor of Reviews of Geophysics, PhD from MIT in meteorology and fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, “Nuclear Winter”, May, Wiley Periodicals)

Nuclear winter is the term for a theory describing the climatic effects of nuclear war
AND
climatic effects of nuclear war is to rid the world of nuclear weapons.

We are at the nuclear tipping point – consensus of experts

Judging by the comments of most political figures, scholars and media pundits, regardless 
AND
states in the region and possibly elsewhere to follow suit in quick succession. 


Plan

The United States Federal Government should fund the development of Small Modular Reactor (SMR) nuclear technology for the United States military

Solvency Observation One - Solvency
DOD should install SMRs on military bases—catalyzes support for SMR and US leadership—ensures global spillover of SMR.

Problematically, despite the immense energy security benefits that would accompany the wide-

DoD’s operational experience with nuclear power allows for a better understanding of current options.
The U.S. Navy launched the USS Nautilus, the world’s first nuclear 
AND
around the same time that national interest in nuclear power began to wane.

The “Valley of Death.” Given the promise that small reactors hold for military 
AND
the future, then it should pursue a leader- ship role now.
