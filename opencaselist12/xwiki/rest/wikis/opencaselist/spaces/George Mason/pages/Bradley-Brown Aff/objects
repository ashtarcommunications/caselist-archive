Plan: The United States Federal Government should mandate and fund the development and deployment of Small Modular Reactor (SMR) nuclear technology for the United States military.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
ADV 1: Military&#xD;
Military actions to reduce and change energy inputs fail – critical security obstacles prevent solutions&#xD;
Andres and Breetz 2011&#xD;
The DOD interest in small reactors derives&#xD;
AND&#xD;
Each of these is explored below.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
Civilian grid failures put the military at risk&#xD;
Andres and Breetz&#xD;
DOD is unable to provide its bases with electricity&#xD;
AND&#xD;
interdependence of modern infrastructural systems&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
Energy tech is key to military efficiency. Only SMRs can provide enough power for the military to sustain itself&#xD;
Andres and Breetz&#xD;
Operational energy use represents a second serious vulnerability&#xD;
AND&#xD;
to save hundreds or thousands of U.S. lives.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
SMR’s are key to mission effectiveness and domestic nuclear energy&#xD;
Andres and Breetz&#xD;
The mission of DoD is to provide &#xD;
AND&#xD;
capability of the United States to add new nuclear capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
DoD is key to Clean energy success &#xD;
Andres and Breetz&#xD;
No entity in government knows better&#xD;
AND&#xD;
poised to lead the world&amp;#39;s clean energy economy&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
Military clean energy is key to national security&#xD;
Lehner 12&#xD;
The Department of Defense is embracing clean &#xD;
AND&#xD;
benefits across the civilian population.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
Clean energy is key to the military power&#xD;
Rogers 12&#xD;
The U.S. military is overwhelmingly dependent&#xD;
AND&#xD;
Both are good for the military and the nation&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
military readiness key to prevent extinction&#xD;
feldstein 2007&#xD;
Deterring other great powers, such as&#xD;
AND&#xD;
perhaps the reality—of the U.S. military structure.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
grid reliance provides incentive for attack- kills hege and escalates to nuke war&#xD;
andres and breetz&#xD;
More recently, awareness has been growing&#xD;
AND&#xD;
a few days after the civilian grid went offline.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
Hege prevents regional conflict, and multiple nuclear war scenarios&#xD;
Kagan 2007&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
Adv 2: Nonprolif&#xD;
Nuclear power investment is being avoided – SMR investment leads to major increases in energy production and is key to nuclear energy leadership&#xD;
Goure 2010&#xD;
Yet, with all this attention and money going &#xD;
AND&#xD;
at home and U.S. nuclear reactor sales abroad&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
Nuclear investment increasing internationally &#xD;
Domenici and Miller 2012&#xD;
Internationally, the outlook is quite different&#xD;
AND&#xD;
nuclear energy is still expected to be positive overall.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
New nuclear initiatives are the litmus test for nuclear leadership – sets the US as the international nuclear power &#xD;
Domenici and Miller 2012&#xD;
Historically, the United States has been a leader in nuclear technology &#xD;
AND&#xD;
area for federal energy research and development investment.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
US controlled SMRs key to nonproliferation&#xD;
COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES 2011&#xD;
Third, there is a national security aspect to the development &#xD;
AND&#xD;
share our approach toward safety and nonproliferation&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
Prolif leads to nuclear escalation&#xD;
Utgoff 2002&#xD;
Worse still, in a highly proliferated world there would be &#xD;
AND&#xD;
to bury the bodies of dead cities or even whole nations&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
Deterrence failure is likely. Incomplete intelligence and irrationality in a regional crisis&#xD;
Cimbala, 2007&#xD;
There is no “magic number” of nuclear-armed states &#xD;
AND&#xD;
on the basis of faulty indica- tions and warning. &#xD;
 &#xD;

Solvency:&#xD;
Military pre-commercial move key to SMR tech – 3 reasons&#xD;
Andres and Breetz 2011&#xD;
Thus far, this paper has reviewed two of DOD’s &#xD;
AND&#xD;
these technologies for U.S. military applications.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
SMRs key to a new generation of energy&#xD;
Rosner and Goldberg 2011&#xD;
As stated earlier, SMRs have the potential &#xD;
AND&#xD;
Korea, Russia, and, now rapidly emerging, China. &#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
DOD should install SMRs on military bases—catalyzes support for SMR and US leadership&#xD;
Loudermilk 2011&#xD;
Problematically, despite the immense energy security benefits&#xD;
AND&#xD;
and will work to solidify long-term support for nuclear energy&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
Governmental intervention key for military SMR use&#xD;
King, Huntzinger and Nguyen 2011&#xD;
The costs associated with moving from &#xD;
AND&#xD;
a feasible option for providing elec- tricity to military installations.&#xD;
