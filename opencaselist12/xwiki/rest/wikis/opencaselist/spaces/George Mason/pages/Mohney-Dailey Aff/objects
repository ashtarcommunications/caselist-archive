The DOD interest in small reactors derives largely from problems with base and logistics vulnerability&#xD;
AND&#xD;
through hostile territory to forward locations. Each of these is explored below.&#xD;
&#xD;
2 internal links: &#xD;
First - Grid&#xD;
Military reliance on civilian power provides incentive for grid attack – kills military power projection AND causes nuclear war from escalatory conflicts&#xD;

&#xD;
More recently, awareness has been growing that the grid is also vulnerable to purposive &#xD;
AND&#xD;
function for more than a few days after the civilian grid went offline.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
Civilian grid failures put military electricity access at risk – it provides 99 percent of their power&#xD;

Grid Vulnerability. DOD is unable to provide its bases with electricity when the civilian &#xD;

SMRs are able to be constructed in factories, with manufacturing capabilities already available in &#xD;

Molycorp is the only US-based firm with sizable DoD contracts to supply the rare earth minerals that are absolutely essential in satellite communications, pulsed/continuous wave radar amplifiers, and other communication links at the level we need them to be for advanced defense applications.

Molycorp has too many obstacles to solve – they are losing money, have to import/export from China, cannot compete with monopolies and their stock is at an all time low.

Our critique of appropriations of suffering that do harm does not mean that no appropriations are valid. To conclude that would be to undermine any attempt to respond to human misery. It would be much more destructive than the problem we have identified; it would paralyze social action. We must draw upon the images of human suffering in order to identify human needs and to craft humane responses.

http://energy.nationaljournal.com/2012/05/powering-our-military-whats-th.php~~jap

No one needs to tell consumers about the importance of energy security. They see 
AND
and national security is a false choice – they go hand in hand.



====Third - Clean Energy====

====DoD is key to Clean energy success AND clean energy solves the economy and national security====
**Peckinpaugh and McCain 2012**
~~Tim Peckinpaugh, Partner, K%26L Gates, Steve McCain co-authored this article. He~’s a retired Air Force Colonel who coordinates the national security and energy public policy practice at K%26L Gates, May 22, 2012, The Pentagon: A Leader on Clean Energy
http://energy.nationaljournal.com/2012/05/powering-our-military-whats-th.php~~jap

No entity in government knows better than the Department of Defense (DoD) that 
AND
unified vision, we are poised to lead the world~’s clean energy economy.



====Clean energy is key to the military power – reduces conflicts and increases military capabilities====
**Rogers 2012**
~~Will Rogers, Research Associate, Center for a New American Security, May 21, 2012, It is all about Mission Effectiveness
http://energy.nationaljournal.com/2012/05/powering-our-military-whats-th.php~~jap

The U.S. military is overwhelmingly dependent on fossil fuels, with nearly 
AND
related security challenges. Both are good for the military and the nation.



====US engagement is inevitable—-maintaining heg is key to solve nuclear conflict and every geopolitical hotspot—-key to fostering international cooperation which solves every existential threat.====
**Brooks, Ikenberry, and Wohlforth 13** Stephen Brooks is Associate Professor of Government at Dartmouth College AND John Ikenberry is Albert G. Milbank Professor of Politics and International Affairs at Princeton University and Global Eminence Scholar at Kyung Hee University in Seoul AND John Wohlforth is Daniel Webster Professor of Government at Dartmouth College. &amp;#34;Lean Forward,&amp;#34; Jan/Feb 2013, Foreign Affairs, EBSCO, Accessed date: 1-9-13 y2k

In Defense of American Engagement Since the end of World War II, the United 
AND
an engaged and liberal leading power. The results could well be disastrous.






====Advantage Two: Nuclear Leadership====


====Nuclear investment increasing internationally ====
**Domenici and Miller 12 **~~Senator Pete Domenici and Dr. Warren F. &amp;#34;Pete&amp;#34; Miller, former Department of Energy (DOE) Assistant Secretary for Nuclear Energy ~| July 2012, Maintaining U.S. Leadership in Global Nuclear Energy Markets, Bipartisan Policy Center, http://bipartisanpolicy.org/sites/default/files/Leadership%20in%20Nuclear%20Energy%20Markets.pdf~~jap-http://bipartisanpolicy.org/sites/default/files/Leadership in Nuclear Energy Markets.pdf%5djap

Internationally, the outlook is quite different: a number of countries intend to grow 
AND
, global growth in nuclear energy is still expected to be positive overall.


====Nuclear energy leadership key to control of nonproliferation, only players can change the game====
**Wallace and Williams 12 **(Michael Wallace and Sarah Williams &amp;#34;Nuclear Energy in America: Preventing its Early Demise&amp;#34; 2012 http://csis.org/files/publication/120417_gf_wallace_williams.pdf-http://csis.org/files/publication/120417_gf_wallace_williams.pdf)

Third, in the past, the U.S. government could exert influence 
AND
.S. nuclear industry and take ¶ action to prevent its early demise


====US Nuclear power leadership solves proliferation and international nuclear accidents – increases reliance on US nuclear policies====
**Domenici and Miller 12 **~~Senator Pete Domenici and Dr. Warren F. &amp;#34;Pete&amp;#34; Miller, former Department of Energy (DOE) Assistant Secretary for Nuclear Energy ~| July 2012, Maintaining U.S. Leadership in Global Nuclear Energy Markets, Bipartisan Policy Center, http://bipartisanpolicy.org/sites/default/files/Leadership%20in%20Nuclear%20Energy%20Markets.pdf~~jap-http://bipartisanpolicy.org/sites/default/files/Leadership in Nuclear Energy Markets.pdf%5djap

Strategic Goal: Continued strong U.S. leadership in global nuclear security matters 
AND
technologies are sound and we support efforts to maintain and expand these policies.



====We~’re on the brink of rapid prolif- plan key====
CFR 12 (Council on Foreign Relations &amp;#34;The Global Nuclear Nonproliferation Regime&amp;#34; July 5, 2012 http://www.cfr.org/proliferation/global-nuclear-nonproliferation-regime/p18984-http://www.cfr.org/proliferation/global-nuclear-nonproliferation-regime/p18984 DATE ACCESSED: 9/15/12) TM

Nuclear weapons proliferation, whether by state or nonstate actors, poses one of the 
AND
way for &amp;#34;the peace and security-http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Remarks-By-President-Barack-Obama-In-Prague-As-Delivered of a world without nuclear weapons.&amp;#34;




====Proliferation causes extinction====
**Heisbourg 12** ~~Francois Heisbourg, Chairman of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, prof at the Geneva Center for Security Policy, July 2012, &amp;#34;How Bad Would the Further Spread of Nuclear Weapons Be?&amp;#34;,http://www.npolicy.org/userfiles/file/oving%20Beyond%20Pretense%20web%20version.pdf~~%23page=182~~

Human societies tend to lack the imagination to think through, and to act upon
AND
Middle East would make ¶ the Cuban Missile Crisis look easy in comparison.





====Solvency====


====DOD should install SMRs on military bases—catalyzes support for SMR and US leadership—ensures global spillover of SMR.====
**Loudermilk 11**—Micah J. Loudermilk is a Research Associate for the Energy %26 Environmental Security Policy program with the Institute for National Strategic Studies at National Defense University, contracted through ASE Inc. &amp;#34;Small Nuclear Reactors and US Energy Security: Concepts, Capabilities, and Costs-http://www.ensec.org/index.php?option=com_content%26view=article%26id=314:small-nuclear-reactors-and-us-energy-security-concepts-capabilities-and-costs%26catid=116:content0411%26Itemid=375&amp;#34; 31 May 2011 Accessed date: 8-21-12 y2k

Problematically, despite the immense energy security benefits that would accompany the wide-
AND
nuclear industry and will work to solidify long-term support for nuclear energy

Governmental intervention key for military SMR use – &amp;#34;First of a Kind&amp;#34; costs need to be allayed 
**King**, **Huntzinger and Nguyen** 20**11 **~~Marcus King • LaVar Huntzinger • Thoi Nguyen, Feasibility of Nuclear Power on U.S. Military Installations, http://www.cna.org/sites/default/files/research/Nuclear%20Power%20on%20Military%20Installations%20D0023932%20A5.pdf~~jap
 
The costs associated with moving from the current stage of develop- ment of small 
AND
plants are a feasible option for providing elec- tricity to military installations.


====The military has the experience to be an SMR first mover====
**King**, **Huntzinger and Nguyen** **11 **~~Marcus King • LaVar Huntzinger • Thoi Nguyen, Feasibility of Nuclear Power on U.S. Military Installations, http://www.cna.org/sites/default/files/research/Nuclear%20Power%20on%20Military%20Installations%20D0023932%20A5.pdf~~jap

DoD~’s operational experience with nuclear power allows for a better understanding of current options. 
AND
around the same time that national interest in nuclear power began to wane.


====Military pre-commercial move key to SMR tech – 3 reasons====
**Andres and Breetz 11 **~~Richard B. andres is Professor of national Security Strategy at the national War College and a Senior fellow and energy and environmental Security and Policy Chair in the Center for Strategic research, institute for national Strategic Studies, at the national Defense University. Hanna L. Breetz is a doctoral candidate in the Department of Political Science at the Massachusetts institute of technology.

Thus far, this paper has reviewed two of DOD~’s most pressing energy vulnerabilities—
AND
availability and appropriateness of these technologies for U.S. military applications.


====Current SMR initiatives will fail – Potential market failures deters. Only military investment solves through demonstration====
**Andres and Breetz 11 **~~Richard B. andres is Professor of national Security Strategy at the national War College and a Senior fellow and energy and environmental Security and Policy Chair in the Center for Strategic research, institute for national Strategic Studies, at the national Defense University. Hanna L. Breetz is a doctoral candidate in the Department of Political Science at the Massachusetts institute of technology.

The &amp;#34;Valley of Death.&amp;#34; Given the promise that small reactors hold for military 
AND
the future, then it should pursue a leader- ship role now.


====AND, the military is dependent upon energy technology. Efficiency measures and other alternative energies fail – only SMRs can provide enough power for the military to sustain itself and save troop lives ====
**Andres and Breetz 11 **~~Richard B. andres is Professor of national Security Strategy at the national War College and a Senior fellow and energy and environmental Security and Policy Chair in the Center for Strategic research, institute for national Strategic Studies, at the national Defense University.

Operational Vulnerability. Operational energy use represents a second serious vulnerability for the U.
AND
the potential to save hundreds or thousands of U.S. lives.


====No DA- Obama allocated funds for SMR ====

aaaAndrew Klein, a nuclear engineering professor at Oregon State University, sees small reactors 
AND
have the potential to be licensed and in commercial operation in a decade.
