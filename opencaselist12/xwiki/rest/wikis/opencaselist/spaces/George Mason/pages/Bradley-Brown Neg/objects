Monitoring the Climate from Deep Space Scripps is participating in the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) satellite mission, which will collect key information about Earth~’s climate system using the first deep-space climate satellite. With new scientific instruments taking a broad set of measurements, the spacecraft will have a continuous view of the sunlit side of Earth from a vantage point 1.5 million kilometers away. DSCOVR~’s measurements of infrared radiation emitted by Earth will be used to monitor global warming and climate variability. Measurements of the solar wind, magnetic fields, and plasma will advance research and provide early warning of solar events that may pose threats to Earth satellites. DSCOVR~’s views of the details of Earth~’s atmosphere and surface will be distributed to schools and the general public via the Internet.

The crisis of politics can only be solved by using politics
Katawala ~’9 (Sunder, Fabian Society, A Future For Politics, p. 31)

The answer to the political legitimacy crisis is politics. There can be no magic bullet solution to what is primarily a question of political cultural and political education. But the overriding priority should be to pursue political reform in a way that is engaging and educative of the nature of politics itself and that brings about practical results.


Rejecting politics and refusing to engage ensures that the ~’powers that be&amp;#34; win by ensuring no common framework for challenging the status quo
