=Protectionism=

There~’s no warrant why the jones act derails any Free Trade initiatives – 
1 - Fueling protectionism is distinct from precluding free trade
2 – The Jones Act has been around
3 – We had the South Korea FTA pass last year and the US/EU FTA coming up – The burden is on them to prove why the jones act precludes these


====Free Trade Bad - ====
1. Small arms
A. Free trade leads to small arms prolif

http://www.armscontrol.org/act/2001_01-02/lumpejanfeb01.asp-http://www.armscontrol.org/act/2001_01-02/lumpejanfeb01.asp

Several trends gave prominence to the issue of gunrunning in the past decade. Newly

more on the tools of violence and on the markets that supply them.


B. Small arms prolif is nuclear war

http://www.armscontrol.org/act/2001_01-02/lumpejanfeb01.asp-http://www.armscontrol.org/act/2001_01-02/lumpejanfeb01.asp

Small arms individually are not massively deadly, as are nuclear or other &amp;#34;special
AND
every two people killed in war in that decade being a civilian.2


2 - Disease- 
A. Free trade encourages the spread of infectious diseases 
Satin, No Date Given
(Morton, Chief of Agro-Industries and the Post-Harvest Management Service, &amp;#34;FOOD QUALITY AND INTERNATIONAL TRADE&amp;#34;, Written after 1996, http://www.fao.org/ag/ags/Agsi/gtz_html.htm)

Beside others the globalization of our food supply equally contributes to the of emerging disease 
AND
development, from the standpoint of public health it can be very costly.

B. Failure to address emerging diseases risks extinction
Kavita Daswani January 4, 1996 &amp;#34;Leading the way to a cure for AIDS&amp;#34; South China Morning Post (Hong Kong SECTION: Pg. 15

There is a much more pressing medical crisis at hand - one he believes the

The question may be reformulated. Do wars spring from a popular reaction to a

by increasing repression (thereby using one form of violence to abort another).




====— No chance of European war====

Asmus 3 (Ronald, Senior Fellow – German Marshall Fund, Foreign Affairs, September / October, Lexis)

Several factors make the recent collapse in transatlantic cooperation surprising. The crisis came on 
AND
in locking in a post-Cold War peace over the last decade.



====Heg is resilient====
**Wohlforth 7** (William, Professor of Government – Dartmouth College, &amp;#34;Unipolar Stability&amp;#34;, Harvard International Review, Spring, http://hir.harvard.edu/articles/1611/3/)

US military forces are stretched thin, its budget and trade deficits are high, 
AND
its self-inflicted overstretch and tap potentially large wellsprings of latent power. 



====Heg doesn~’t deter war====
Layne 97 (Christopher, Visiting Professor – Naval Postgraduate School, From Preponderance to Offshore Balancing)

Two critical objections could be lodged against an offshore balancing grand strategy: an offshore

fact minimize the risk of U.S. involvement in future wars.




====US/EU Relations resilient====
**Moravcsik 3** (Andrew, Professor of Government and Director of the European Union Program – Harvard University, July/August, Foreign Affairs, Lexis)

Transatlantic optimists are also right when they argue that the recent shifts need not lead

worry about radical Islamism, and fear terrorism and the proliferation of WMD.



====No impact to US/EU relations====

The term federal government refers to the national government, which is centered in Washington, D.C.


====b. Resolved means to enact by law====
Words and Phrases ~’64  (Permanent Edition)

Definition ofthe word &amp;#34;resolve,&amp;#34; given by Webster is &amp;#34;to express an opinion or determination by resolution or vote; as ~’it was resolved by the legislature;&amp;#34; It is of similar force to the word &amp;#34;enact,&amp;#34; which is defined by Bouvier as meaning &amp;#34;to establish by law&amp;#34;.


====They make debate Impossible – ====

====a. Ground- the federal government only stable basis for negground. If they aren~’t tied to defending it then it~’s unlikely we will have applicable research.====

====b. Limits- they allow any individual ideology, theory or cause to become an aff, which negates our ability to effectively research the aff. ====

====c. Extra T- The aff claims advantages that are unrelated to instrumental implementation, proves the resolution insufficient.  ====

Muir ~’93 (Star, Prof. Comm. – George Mason U., Philosophy and Rhetoric, &amp;#34;A Defense of the Ethics of Contemporary Debate&amp;#34;, 26(4), pp. 288-290)

Values clarification, Stewart is correct in pointing out, does not mean that no

Cook ~’92 (Anthony, Associate Professor – Georgetown Law, New England Law Review, Spring, 26 New Eng.L. Rev. 751, Lexis)

The effect of deconstructing the power of the author to impose a fixed meaning on
