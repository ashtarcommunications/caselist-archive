C. Vote Negative 

Ground – best literature for disads comes from preexisting programs – allows the aff to spike out of all our DAS.

This is a good thing, and it should continue to be a primary goal of American foreign policy to perpetuate this relatively benign international configuration of power. …… Difficult as it may be to extend American predominance into the future, no one should imagine that a reduction of American power or a retraction of American influence and global involvement will provide an easier path.

Shapiro 2011 Alan N. Shapiro, Technologist and Futurist, an interdisciplinary thinker who studied science-technology at MIT and philosophy-history-literature at Cornell University, August 25th, 2011 Jean Baudrillard and Doomsday: On Louis Arnoux’s “Catastrophe Warning” Discourse,  http://www.alan-shapiro.com/baudrillard-and-doomsday-on-louis-arnoux%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%9Ccatastrophe-warning%E2%80%9D-discourse/

Many commentators have called Jean Baudrillard an apocalyptic thinker.  This is definitely wrong, as is clearly demonstrated in The Illusion of the End, where …… own efforts to alleviate it (which, in fact, merely function to secure the conditions of reproduction of the catastrophe market).” (67) “We need this drug, which serves us as an aphrodisiac and hallucinogen.” (68) Addicted to catastrophe, like to alcohol or drugs.

Insecurity and danger are inevitable – the attempt to control it only breeds violence
Der Derian 1998 James, prof of political science at Brown, “The Value of Security: Hobbes, Marx, Nietzsche, and Baudrillard On Security,” ed. Ronnie Lipschutz, http://www.ciaonet.org/book/lipschutz/index.html

The desire for security is manifested as a collective …… false sense of security can come from false gods: &amp;#34;Morality and religion belong altogether to the psychology of error : in every single case, cause and effect are confused; or truth is confused with the effects of believing  something to be true; or a state of consciousness is confused with its causes.&amp;#34; 41
This requires a fundamental reorientation toward the illusion of the end – the apocalyptic end is truly illusionary and we must maintain this poetic and ironic distance to the chaos of the end to generate the communicative potential for change.

Resisting capitalism’s reliance on economic evaluation is the ultimate ethical responsibility – the current social order guarantees social exclusion on a global scale 
Zizek and Daly 2k4 (Slavoj and Glyn, Conversations with Zizek page 14-16)
For Zizek it is imperative that we cut through this Gordian knot of postmodern protocol and recognize that our ethico-political responsibility is to confront the constitutive violence of today’s global capitalism and its….  is that it would not attempt to conceal this fact or reduce the status of the abject Other to that of a ‘glitch’ in an otherwise sound matrix. 

Thus our alternative is an unconditional commitment to the Communist Hypothesis.  Every ethical decision should be infused with all of the significance of humanity’s destiny.  The question regarding the plan is “does it confirm or contradict the communist hypothesis.”  If we win a link, you reject the affirmative - they reduce life to a barbaric ratrace and stand opposed to universal emancipation.  
Alain Badiou, former Chair of Philosophy at École normale supérieure, 2008.  The Meaning of Sarkozy, pp. 97-103 

I would like to situate the Sarkozy episode, which is not an impressive page …. or the tasks of philosophy. For what we are witnessing in no way imposes such a renunciation of the communist hypothesis, but simply a consideration of the moment at which we find ourselves in the history of this hypothesis.

Economic collapse doesn’t cause war – no causal connection

Wind power doesn’t boost the economy – only shifts the burden to the government

The problem with subsidizing wind and solar power is that subsidies don&amp;#39;t make these unaffordable energy sources affordable, they just change who pays. Taxpayers foot a ….. Whatever they may be doing with wind and solar power pales in comparison with what they are doing with coal-fired electricity.

As I mentioned in Fitting Wind ….. wind can be only 6 percent of the generation (.20 x .3). This limit has already been reached in Europe by countries such as Germany and Denmark. 

PTC’s concentrate wind power with the wealthy – makes it inefficient
Wiser et al 07 Ryan Wiser, Mark Bolinger, and Galen Barbose are all staff scientists at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, “Using the Federal Production Tax Credit to Build a Durable¶ Market for Wind Power in the United States,” pre-print of article submitted to the Electricity Journal, November 2007, http://eetd.lbl.gov/ea/emp/reports/63583.pdf accessed 9-26-12cd

The PTC has also sometimes been criticized as being too ….. in the use of the PTC, and certainly some¶ lack of parity in what types of entities can realistically participate in wind project ownership.
