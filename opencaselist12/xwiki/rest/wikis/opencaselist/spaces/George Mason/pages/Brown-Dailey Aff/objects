====The &amp;#34;Valley of Death.&amp;#34; Given the promise that small reactors hold for military installations and mobility, DOD has a compelling interest in ensuring that they make the leap from paper to production. However, if DOD does not provide an initial demonstration and market, there is a chance that the U.S. small reactor industry may never get off the ground.The leap from the laboratory to the marketplace is so difficult to bridge that it is widely referred to as the &amp;#34;Valley of Death.&amp;#34; Many promising technologies are never commercialized due to a variety of market failures— including technical and financial uncertainties, infor- mation asymmetries, capital market imperfections, transaction costs, and environmental and security ex- ternalities—that impede financing and early adoption and can lock innovative technologies out of the mar- ketplace.28 In such cases, the Government can help a worthy technology to bridge the Valley of Death by accepting the first mover costs and demonstrating the technology~’s scientific and economic viability.29 Historically, nuclear power has been &amp;#34;the most clear-cut example . . . of an important general-purpose technology that in the absence of military and defense- related procurement would not have been developed at all.&amp;#34;30 Government involvement is likely to be crucial for innovative, next-generation nuclear technology as well. Despite the widespread revival of interest in nu- clear energy, Daniel Ingersoll has argued that radically innovative designs face an uphill battle, as &amp;#34;the high capital cost of nuclear plants and the painful lessons learned during the first nuclear era have created a prevailing fear of first-of-a-kind designs.&amp;#34;31 In addition, Massachusetts Institute of Technology reports on the Future of Nuclear Power called for the Government to provide modest &amp;#34;first mover&amp;#34; assistance to the private sector due to several barriers that have hindered the nu- clear renaissance, such as securing high up-front costs of site-banking, gaining NRC certification for new technologies, and demonstrating technical viability.32 It is possible, of course, that small reactors will achieve commercialization without DOD assistance. As discussed above, they have garnered increasing attention in the energy community. Several analysts have even ar- gued that small reactors could play a key role in the sec- ond nuclear era, given that they may be the only reactors within the means of many U.S. utilities and developing countries.33 However, given the tremendous regulatory hurdles and technical and financial uncertainties, it ap- pears far from certain that the U.S. small reactor industry will take off. If DOD wants to ensure that small reactors are available in the future, then it should pursue a leader- ship role now.====&#xD;
