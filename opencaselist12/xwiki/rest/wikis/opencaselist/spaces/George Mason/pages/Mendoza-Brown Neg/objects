The drive for renewable energy plays into the capitalist drive for profits – planetary catastrophe is inevitable under capitalism regardless of whether we transition from oil to renewables.

In 2008, the companies making the largest worldwide profits were all oil companies (

Meszaros 7 (Istvan Professor Emeritus t Sussex, &amp;#34;The Only Viable Economy,&amp;#34; Monthly Review, http://www.monthlyreview.org/0407meszaros.htm)

Nuclear power is implicitly representative of a capitalist drive for profits despite the dangers it poses

As the large, easy reservoirs of fossil fuels are exhausted, the capitalist machine 
AND
unabated, will make the earth uninhabitable for life as we know it. 

1nc Ethics Impact

Resisting capitalism’s reliance on economic evaluation is the ultimate ethical responsibility – the current social order guarantees social exclusion on a global scale
Zizek and Daly 2k4 (Slavoj and Glyn, Conversations with Zizek page 14-16)
For Zizek it is imperative that we cut through this Gordian knot of postmodern protocol 
AND

Thus our alternative is a commitment to the Communist Hypothesis.  Every ethical decision should be infused with all of the significance of humanity’s destiny. The affirmative reduces life to a barbaric ratrace and stands opposed to universal emancipation.
