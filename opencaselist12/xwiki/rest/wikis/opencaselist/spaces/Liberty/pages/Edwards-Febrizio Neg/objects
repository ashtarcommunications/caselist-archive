&#xD;
A final consideration in the separation of environment and energy is the role of security discourses. Corresponding with the emergence of a “new” discourse on environmental security was an “old” security establishment that jealously guarded its domain. This was reflected in the academic community’s aversion to broader and deeper notions of security, which in many ways seemed “utterly alien to the security studies community.” 63 The environment did not invoke the specter of organized violence, nor were national security (i.e. military) technologies and methods likely to be helpful for most environmental problems—rather, military research and actions were recognized as a major cause of degradation. 64 And despite the wide range of issues discussed under critical security studies (CSS), the notion of “threats without enemies” 65 rubs gratingly against more established views of security analysts. On the other hand, analysts have long viewed energy (and especially oil)  as a national security concern, and the military role in ensuring (or preventing) access to energy resources is well established. By the time environmental security came on stage, then, energy supply was already understood as a matter of national security. 66 Moreover, many key analytical characteristics of environmental security did not seem to apply to energy resources. In the latter, sovereign claims over the resource enabled the identification of an enemy that could be confronted, a “will” that might be broken (OPEC, Saddam Hussein). Thus, energy security could be provided for by military means, while also being essential for military superiority. Perhaps most importantly, the structure of sovereign rights and the physical and institutional excludability of energy resources has sidelined efforts to consider these as global or commons resources. 67 Surely fossil fuels could be seen as a commons problem, similar to freshwater sources, with distinct rights for “upstream” and “downstream” users—a point that suggests prospects for international governance arrangements. Yet fossil fuels have historically been seen in terms of “property,” and as subject to states’ sovereign right to exploit their natural resources. 68 &#xD;

Effective deliberation requires a forum of discussion that facilitates political agonism and the capacity to substantively engage the topic at hand~-~--in short, a forum of switch side debate where the negative can predict and respond to the aff is the most intellectually effective~-~--this is crucial to affecting productive change in all facets of life~-~--the process in this instance is more important than the substance of their advocacy &#xD;

There is an institutional bias in favor of speciesism-the AFF’s failure to directly challenge it allows hegemonic discourses to constrain the parameters of discussion and political activity which allows specieisism to continue. &#xD;

What is equally … direct and disproportionate effects on animals.[26] &#xD;
NOTE- conditio sine qua non &#xD;
&#xD;
The alternative is to embrace the standpoint of the animal—this overcomes the humanist bias of the affirmative scholarship, connects the experiences of human and non-human animals and allows for total liberation by providing understanding of all oppression&#xD;
