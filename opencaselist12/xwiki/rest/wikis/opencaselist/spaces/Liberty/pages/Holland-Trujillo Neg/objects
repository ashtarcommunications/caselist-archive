A. Interpretation: The Aff should have to defend the resolution by advocating United States Federal Government action to increase incentives or decrease regulation for energy 

B. Our interpretation is Grounded in the Resolution
1. The topic is defined by the phrase following the colon—the USFG is the agent of the resolution, not the individual debaters
Webster’s Guide to Grammar and Writing 2k 

Use of a ……….a capital letter. 

2. The United States Federal Government is the one in D.C.
ENCARTA WORLD ONLINE ENCYCLOPEDIA, 2006, p. http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_1741500781/United_States_(Government).html 

United States Government, …….in Washington, D.C.

3. Should implies policy – it expresses that the government has a duty or obligation
American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language04
(&amp;#34;should.&amp;#34; The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition. Houghton Mifflin Company, 2004. 20 Sep. 2006. Dictionary.com http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=should)

should (shd)  ………..
send her a note. 

C. Violation –
1. The affirmative fails to defend a fiat based interpretation of an expansion of visa policy through the United States Federal Government, instead they seek to expand the scope of the discussion.


Contention Two: Reasons to Prefer

Resolution centered debate is critical to a fair debate – it’s a voting issue.

1. Predictability- 
A. the resolution sets the topic for discussion- allowing the aff to choose their ground outside of the resolution makes it impossible for the negative to engage the affirmative. There are an infinite amount of non-policy advocacies unrelated to the topic which are impossible to predict- this leaves the negative unprepared to debate

B. Exploding predictable limits neutralizes the discursive benefits to debate and renders their advocacy meaningless—only our interpretation preserves the revolutionary potential of a deliberative activity
Ruth Shively, former professor of political science at Texas AandM, 2000 (Political Theory and Partisan Politics p. 180)

Thus far, I ………..and democracy.

C. Aff conditionality- only a resolutionally-based plan prevents shifting advocacies- their framework allows aff vagueness, enabling the aff to become a moving target which destroys discussion, advocacy skills and fair ground


D. The resolution presents an agreed question which is the focus of the debate. Debate is worthless without the predictability that is necessary to generate a starting point for discussion
Ruth Shively, former professor of political science at Texas AandM, 2000 (Political Theory and Partisan Politics p. 181-2)

The requirements given ………..agreement or harmony.

E. Unpredictable or unfair debates preclude an informed discussion that allows us to critically examine their approach- this prevents informed clash which outweighs all other impacts - fairness is a prerequisite because we can’t test the truth-value of an argument or advocacy without rigorously examining it.

2. Education -
A. policy options are key to real world education about possible reforms- their framework devastates learning about the real world with reciprocal and clear deliberation about the merits of an idea

B. Topical Education—by manipulating the topic to access their political project they skirt debate about the implementation of policies by the government.  Their education is distrusting of institutional study and pragmatic reform.  Even if their intentions are noble, their message results in fascist totalitarianism
Martin W. Lewis, Professor of Geography and Regional Science at George Washington University, 1992 (Green Delusions: An Environmentalist Critique of Radical Environmentalism. Page 247)

A majority of …….their instructors’ intentions. 
 

C. Implementation- the aff will always win the principles of their advocacy are good in the abstract- we can only debate the merits of arguments if they defend the specific consequences of political implementation
Michael Ignatieff, Harvard Carr Center for Human Rights Policy director and human rights practices professor, 04 (The Lesser Evil: Political Ethics in an Age of Terror, 20-21)

There are two ………to betray another.

D. Informed Citizens - Fiat is key to being informed citizens, without it we never learn about the political process and don’t take responsibility for the possible bad outcomes of our actions. Simulating policy solves all their offense, allowing people a safe space to test new ideas
Christopher C. Joyner, Professor of International Law in the Government Department at Georgetown University, Spring 1999 (Teaching International Law: Views From An International Relations Political Scientist, 5 ILSA J Int&amp;#39;l and Comp L 377)

Use of the debate can ………critique, and legal defense. 
 

3. Our Framework is Good – it prevents things like personal stories and narratives which risk intruding on and damaging other peoples personal lives.

A. When we make debate about stories we have to debate those stories – risking dehumanization and forcing people to quit
Deborah Tannen, Ph.D., Georgetown University linguistics professor, ‘98, “The Argument Culture,” p. 81-3

In explaining his ……..the phrase “quota queen.’”
