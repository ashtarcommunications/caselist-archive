&#xD;
**Born out of the belly of the beast with only one place to go and that is down. I am now Hells angel.**&#xD;
&#xD;
**Battered and bruised scattered confused is the only response to my intelligence in a world where I must be ignorant.**&#xD;
&#xD;
**I have endured the sounds of car doors locking as whites secure themselves from my black body**&#xD;
&#xD;
**The locks on the doors resound: Click. Click. Click. Click.**&#xD;
&#xD;
**The sound becomes deafening, maddening in its repetition but nevertheless remind me that I am dangerous**&#xD;
&#xD;
**Stand with me**&#xD;
&#xD;
**As I walk through myrtle ave where the only thing I have strapped is a bag to my back to bad I’m not the only one strapped.**&#xD;
&#xD;
**At a crossroads where the white house meets the crack house**&#xD;
&#xD;
**Ask the lord to save my soul but how can he when its black**&#xD;
&#xD;
**Stained with the wrongs of this world, guilty without the option of innocence**&#xD;
&#xD;
**Look at me**&#xD;
&#xD;
**They say black don’t crack but the world does when they see black**&#xD;
&#xD;
**Drenched with your sin and mine as if you can do know wrong.**&#xD;
&#xD;
**My back is hunched with pain as a tremble with shame.**&#xD;
&#xD;
**I am rejected a vile infestation that plagues your very existence. I am the negro.**&#xD;
&#xD;
**Feel Me**&#xD;
&#xD;
**Feel my anger feel my pain**&#xD;
&#xD;
**Feel my weakness in your gaze**&#xD;
&#xD;
**Then tell me why your afraid.**&#xD;
&#xD;
**Trayvon felt this pain feel the bullets in his veins now I know why you fear me.**&#xD;
&#xD;
**Understand this**&#xD;
&#xD;
**There are times when I want to become your fantasy, to become the Black monster,**&#xD;
&#xD;
**the bogeyman, to pull open your car door: “Surprise. You’ve just been**&#xD;
&#xD;
**carjacked by a ghost, a fantasy of your own creation.**&#xD;
&#xD;
**I have endured white women clutching their purses or walking across**&#xD;
&#xD;
**the street as they catch a glimpse of my approaching Black body. It is during**&#xD;
&#xD;
**such moments that my body is given back to me in a ludicrous light, where I live**&#xD;
&#xD;
**the meaning of my body as confiscated.**&#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;

**My Blackness is only present through a continuous grammar of suffering; that grammar is one of accumulation and fungibility through a status of non-humanity that positions slaves as provision for Civil Society. This provision is not simply the material support like modern energy policies but rather the essence of the White subject within the world. The meta-physical and gratuitous violence creates the dichotomy between structural life and death – making the African that entered the ship a Black when it went. Fungibility is the structural essence for Civil Society and the condition of possibility for the ‘living.’**&#xD;

**This year’s discussion of Energy policy entertains none of the pre-made assumptions of America’s first Energy policy, and instead only seeks to mystify it’s ethical relationship between authentic Self and the condition of possibility of its existence; Slavery. From our past to the present, the logic of slave totalities permeates any and every topical discussion throughout addiction to energy as the externalization of labor via a process of creating fungible objects that only serve to be accumulated and die. To accept the resolution is to accept the mantle of the Slave-Master and exists only to extend an epistemology of ignorance that is parasitic on Slave-flesh; in whatever capacity that may hold.**&#xD;

**Therefore, Alex and I embrace the insatiable demand of the Slave to peruse the antagonistic nature of Civil Society and disavow the centrality of fungible logic through anti-blackness that permeates energy production policies within the topic**&#xD;

**The insatiable demand of the Slave is organic to the destruction of civil society. Our absolute abandonment in the face of the ethical coherency of civil society allows it to fall in on itself. Other satiable demands crowd out the demand of the Slave, preserving a culture of Anti-Blackness**&#xD;

**Politics that focus on exploitation (i.e. – the satiable demands of civil society’s junior partners) produce a narrative of loss followed by restoration. These are the contingent freedoms that replace the Black void with a positive Human value; within the world and not against it. What is needed is freedom from the human race, the world, Gratuitous Freedom that demand not that the Black be made living again, but to bring the living to death.**&#xD;

**Civil society maps itself by the reconfiguration of rights through freedom – maintaining its position of anti-blackness. This constructs America’s benevolent hegemony of coherence. What is needed is the radical injection of society’s incoherence, the ‘wretched of the earth;’ the politics of the Black Body with a gesture towards the disconfiguration of Civil Society.**&#xD;

**The scholarship we produce in debate produces specific forms of education; our scholarship orients the ballot for the gratuitous freedom of the slave. The education we produce on the social paradox of slavery is //our// insatiable demand within but against civil society, the state and the debate community. We call for an epistemic break to the world; a concept of violent revolution that makes the death of social reality, our reality.**&#xD;

Such as stance is linked to normative practices used to produce networks of oppression. This also is a self-robbery of agency that foregoes our legacy of colonialism and complacency within USFG policymaking.**&#xD;
