New deal: There’s no shortage of advice for the White House and Congress on how to avoid the fiscal cliff and rein in the deficit. So why shouldn’t they take it? In the event that lame-duck negotiations between Obama and Republicans blow up, they could fall back on something like a recently released framework from the Bipartisan Policy Center. The suggested legislation envisions turning off the fiscal cliff, but would require a down payment of tax and spending changes that would be built on as part of a bigger debt reduction package in 2013. The aim is to save $4 trillion over 10 years. It’s doubtful that the president and lawmakers would simply take a single policy group’s advice wholesale. But elements could wind up in a surprise deal.

Contention One


===Current supply is absolutely unsustainable===


===1. The economics of shale are horrid===
Ahmed, Institute for Policy Research and Development executive director, 1-10-13
(Nafeez, &amp;#34;The Great Oil Swindle&amp;#34;, http://www.fpif.org/articles/the_great_oil_swindle, DOA: 1-17-13, ldg/atl)

But there are further reasons for concern. For how reliable is the IEA~’s data
AND
even bigger financial mess, on a faster trajectory toward costly environmental destruction. 


===2. Overproduction ensures gas bubble—causes rapid collapse of the industry===
Callahan, PhD Chemist, 12
(Jonathan, worked for almost 20 years as a data analysis/data visualization expert for various Federal science agencies, February 6, 2012, &amp;#34;Gas boom goes bust&amp;#34;, http://www.energybulletin.net/stories/2012-02-06/gas-boom-goes-bust-http://www.energybulletin.net/stories/2012-02-06/gas-boom-goes-bust, 2/5/13, atl)

The current boom in drilling for ~’unconventional~’ gas has helped raise US production to 
AND
information presented above, I would humbly submit that it has just arrived.


===3. New fracking regulations===
Plumer, Washington Post, 2012
(Brad, &amp;#34;How states are regulating fracking (in maps)&amp;#34;, 7-16, http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/07/16/how-states-are-regulating-fracking-in-maps/-http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/07/16/how-states-are-regulating-fracking-in-maps/, DOA: 1-17-13, ldg)

Armed with new drilling techniques, companies are spreading out across the United States, 
AND
, the IEA notes, could prove even more costly to the gas industry

Contention Two


===Naval power makes war unthinkable—decline in leadership collapses trade, ensures piracy spread, and sparks multiple scenarios for nuclear war—shipbuilding and a strong industrial base ensures resiliency===
Eaglen, Heritage Foundation Research Fellow for National Security Studies, 11

(Joseph, House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources Hearing; Fisheries, Wildlife, Oceans and Insular Affairs Legislative Hearing on H.R. 306, H.R. 588, S. 266 and H.R. 285&amp;#34;, 4-6, lexis, ldg)

Apart from national energy concerns, however, economic considerations also favor increased development of 
AND

===Key to seabasing capabilities—ensures naval flexibility that sustains global deterrence— solves war===
Etter, was United States Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for S%26T from 1998 to 2001, 06
(Dr. Delores M., Assistant Secretary of the Navy from 2005 to 2007, &amp;#34;Statement Of The Honorable Dr. Delores M. Etter.

====Rejection insufficient-feasibility is key to challenging hegemonic discourses. ====

Thus, the critical quality rests on the assumption that representations of the world make

Are they possibly a constitutive part of the mastery of the dominant construction? 



====Perm do both- pragmatic embrace of natural gas key to sustainable energy paradigm shift====
Huber, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam Energy Studies, 11

Why did so many commentators presume Prince William Sound the victim of an instant doom

====Extinction outweighs even if they are right-key to true ethical relations====
Gelven, Northern Illinois philosophy professor, 1994
(Michael, War and Existence: A Philosophical Inquiry, p. 136-137, ldg)

The personal pronouns, like &amp;#34;I&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;We,&amp;#34; become governed existentially

While theoretical debates at academic conferences  are important to academics, the discourse and concerns

needs to always be open to the patterned mess that is  human history.


====Scarcity and environmental degradation are self-correcting-but maintaining the profit motive is key====
Desrochers, Toronto geography professor, 2010

&amp;#34;The main obstacle to action,&amp;#34; writes Frank, &amp;#34;is neither apathy nor

====Energy should be evaluated through a realist lens ====
Cesnakas, Vytautas Magnus University political science doctoral candidate, 2010
(Giedrius, &amp;#34;Energy Resources In Foreign Policy: A Theoretical Approach&amp;#34;, Baltic Journal Of Law %26 Politics, 3.1, online pdf, ldg)

Because energy resources are material objects and demand a materialistic ontology and positivistic epistemology, 
AND
power – can use energy resources in foreign policy more actively and efficiently.


====Threats are real and we should act on them – they exist independent of fear ====
Knudsen, Sodertom political science professor, 2001
(Olav, &amp;#34;Post-Copenhagen Security Studies: Desecuritizing Securitization&amp;#34;, Security Dialogue 2001 32: 355, SAGE, ldg)

Moreover, I have a problem with the underlying implication that it is unimportant whether

Fitzsimmons, defense analyst in Washington DC, 07
(Michael, &amp;#34;The Problem of Uncertainty in Strategic Planning&amp;#34;, Survival (00396338), December 1, 2006, 10/24/12, atl)

In defence of prediction Uncertainty is not a new phenomenon for strategists. Clausewitz knew 
AND
reinvigorate their efforts in the messy but indispensable business of predicting the future.


====IR nuclear war gaming key to good predictions and effective policy-making====
Han, Nebraska political science PhD candidate, 2010
(Dong-ho, &amp;#34;Scenario Construction and Implications for IR Research: Connecting Theory to a Real World of Policy Making&amp;#34;, 1-26, http://citation.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/4/1/5/6/2/pages415621/p415621-1.php-http://citation.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/4/1/5/6/2/pages415621/p415621-1.php, DOA: 3-21-13, ldg)

Another example of the use of scenario analysis by defense planners can be found in

alternatives to a &amp;#34;scientific&amp;#34; approach it offers to mainstream IR theorizing.


====Institutional logics exist independently of individuals-alt can~’t solve. ====
Wight, Sydney IR professor, 2006

One important aspect of this relational ontology is that these relations constitute our identity as

AND
we must advocate on a daily basis, not only when disaster strikes.


====The K causes genocide====
Dollimore, Sussex sociologist, 1998
(Jonathan,  Death, Desire and Loss in Western Culture, pg 221, ldg)

The ideology of death is the corollary of the ideology of God, in that

, Buchenwald, Dachau, and Bergen-Belsen~’ (p.69)


====Their K assumes obsession with personal death; Turn — stopping meaningless human created extinction is key to affirm life====
Barash, University of Washington Professor of Psychology, 85
(David P, &amp;#34;The Caveman and the Bomb&amp;#34; p.261-267, 3/28/13, atl)

Fortunately, whatever genetic imperatives operate in Homo sapiens, they are unlikely to extend

Obama Not Key 

Passage is inevitable – GOP is doing it for political survival and all major figures support it – no one can score political points by opposing it which means no risk of backlash  - zero reason Obama is necessary – it’s all about Rubio and Paul - that’s Chait 

Interest groups and public support means lawmakers don’t have a choice – momentum is irreversible – that’s Kimm 

You should discount quotes from politicians – just pandering – don’t give structural reasons Obama is relevant – No reverse causal argument why him being absent would change anything – even If it’s true he’s involved now 

Their zeilzer evidence says - The election of 2012 scared many Republicans into thinking that their increasingly hardline stance on immigration is cutting against big demographic changes. There are political incentives for passage
