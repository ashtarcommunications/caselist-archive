== The current political discourse is centered on an ensemble of questions that are fixated on social conflicts through experience as opposed to the grammar of suffering that undergirds the United States and its foundational antagonisms. Continuation of the current discourse only mystifies the paradigmatic relation of the Slave and the ‘Savage’ and their respective demands in the name of “social stability.” ==&#xD;

**Blackness and Redness exist in a state of perpetual violence through a life constituted by disorientation as opposed to contingently interrupted by it. This is the structural position of being the Slave and Savage position external to the realm of the Settler/Master; violence as paradigmatic necessity subsumes cognitive maps and conceptual frameworks both systemically and epistemic contexts**&#xD;

== The alternative is an unflinching paradigmatic analysis that calls for the end of America. If we win the question of how the US has ethically distanced itself from Black and Red bodies then the round becomes a question of how we orient our intellectual discourse; the alternative calls for a revolutionary zeitgeist aimed at the overthrow of the political-project that is America. ==&#xD;
