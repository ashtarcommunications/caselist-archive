A. The 1AC is a condemnation of tragedy – they require the construction of an ideal world in opposition to our current world of suffering and imperfection. In a drive toward resolving disorder, the plan labors to shape the world to fit its impossible fantasy of perfection. 
Saurette, professor of Politics at the University of Ottawa, 1996 
 (Paul, “I Mistrust All Systematizers and Avoid Them: Nietzsche, Arendt, and the Crisis of the Will to Order in International Relations Theory” Millenium, Vol 25, No 1). Jt  


B. We will always be able to locate some external threat to world order. The insecurities pointed out by the 1AC are not unique, for life, and international relations in particular, is unpredictable, paradoxical, and in many ways unknowable. If the terrorist don’t get us, the natural disaster will, or maybe we’ll go to war with Russia, perhaps a trade war with China will erupt or asteroid will strike. Threats, wars, accidents – these uncertainties and risks are part and parcel of human life. At issue here is NOT just life and existence itself, but is what makes life valuable and worth saving. We should encourage indifference and carelessness in a world inherently characterized by insecurity in an effort to reclaim the joy that makes life beautiful. 

Der Derian, Professor of Politics at the University of Massachusetts, 1998. (James., “The Value of Security: Hobbes, Marx, Nietzsche, and Baudrillard”, On Security, ed. By Ronnie Lipschutz, http://www.ciaonet.org/book/lipschutz/index.html). Jt 

C. Life is a beautiful and twisted work of art – suffering is intrinsic to the condition of humanity. The idea that we have the ability to control the world by ridding it of tragedy allows suffering to be the dominating force and focus of our lives which destroys all value to life. 

Kain, Professor of philosophy at University of Santa Clara 2007. (Philip, &amp;#34;Nietzsche, Eternal Recurrence, and the Horror of Existence,&amp;#34; The Journal of Nietzsche Studies, Issue 33, Project Muse). Jt 


D. Stare into the horror of existence and vote negative – embrace life and accept the world as it is the status quo. Only accepting and loving our inevitable fate of suffering can we end the destructive cycle perpetuated by the affirmative. 

Owen, Professor of Social Science at the University of Southhampton, 1995. (David, Nietzsche, Politics and Modernity, p. 113-115). Jt 



PERM do part
The permutation’s compromise refuses to rethink security~-~--it remains mired in assumptions of mastery, trapping us in very mindset we’ve identified as problematic.  

 Connolly, Professor of Political Science at Johns Hopkins University, 1999. (William E., Identity/Difference: Democratic Negotiations of Political Paradox, pg. 29-31). Jt 



The effort to control proliferation has turned into an absolute battle between good and evil.  It has become a blank check for unlimited war designed to make the world fit our image of security. 
Der Derian, Professor of Politics at the University of Massachusetts, 2003 (James., Ph.d. in political science., “Decoding The National Security Strategy of the United States of America”, Boundary 2, Vol 30, No 3, 19-27). Jt 

The holocaust was a result of ressentiment and the Nazi States hatred of a chaotic world beyond control

Peachy, senior lecturer of politics at the University of Cardiff, 2003.  (Paul, Ph.D. in politics., “Post Soviet Societies: Chauvinism or Catharsis”, March 30, http://www.crvp.org/book/Series04/IVA-7/chapter_ix.htm). Jt

1. Education- their interpretation forces us to ignore the role of policy formulation- that’s utopian and destroys education
Garrett, USC public policy professor, 9 


4. Big lit base on the CP-solves their offense.
Gaines et al., Institute for Natural Resources consultant and associate director, 2007
(Lisa, “NEPA for the 21st Century: A Comparative Analysis of Other Organizations’ Environmental Review Structures”, 5-16, http://www.fs.fed.us/pnw/about/programs/fsd/NEPA/Final%20Draft%20 Report-160507.pdf, DOA: 8-21-12, ldg)


5. No ground loss- just need one reason prioritizing the environment or binding review is bad.
