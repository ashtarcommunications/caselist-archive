Large-scale remote solar projects...many types of costs onto local communities, ratepayers, and ecosystems.


And the types of incentives that specifically spur distributed solar projects are lacking in America
Nelder ’11 (Chris, “Why America needs a feed-in tariff” Smart Planet.  November 9, 2011. http://www.smartplanet.com/blog/energy-futurist/why-america-needs-a-feed-in-tariff/174)

The absence of a FiT has spawned a renewables...industry instead of adding new capacity.
Plan
The United States Federal Government should implement feed-in tariffs for solar energy production in the United States. 
FiTs are the most sound policy options for allowing communities to quickly transition to renewable energy
Block ’12 (Ben, World Watch Institute, “North American Feed-in Tariff Policies Take Off” 2012.  http://www.worldwatch.org/node/6221)
Clean energy advocates in Europe have long...and Ontario as examples that North America should follow

FITs effectively lower the cost of solar PV systems, making them more attractive than large-scale installation

Distributed generation, supported through feed-in tariffs are implemented faster than large-scale operations

Large-scale remote solar...half times as large.

Climate Change is a short and long term threat to everything on Earth.  If we do not transition away from fossil fuels, then an irreversible cycle of feedbacks will melt the ice caps, raise sea levels and eventually result in the extinction of multiple species.
Hansen ’12 (James, director of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space studies in New York and a leading atmospheric scientist.  Energy: Overdevelopment and the Delusion of Endless Growth, “Coal: The Greatest Threat to Civilization” 2012, Post Carbon Institute)

The climate is nearing tipping points...destroying more species.

Those who lead us have no...the world we inherited from our elders.
Distributed generation can mitigate GHGs faster and more effectively than large, industrial solar

Unlike energy systems in the “concrete jungle” ecosystem...which is the case with distributed generation.

Our large, centralized  grid is vulnerable to threats ranging from terrorist attacks all the way to simply pressing the wrong button.  Any of these scenarios can result in a massive blackout at any time.

On Tuesday July 31, 2012, India’s interconnected power...increase the likelihood of systems collapse.”

Electricity is necessary for everyday life.  Blackouts put humanity at risk of being unable to live safely.

Most critical systems such as hospitals...no water for emergency response teams.

A terrorist attack on the...insurance during the second quarter.
Distributed energy systems come into existence quickly, are more resilient to disruptions, and reduce the demand for new grid infrastructure.
