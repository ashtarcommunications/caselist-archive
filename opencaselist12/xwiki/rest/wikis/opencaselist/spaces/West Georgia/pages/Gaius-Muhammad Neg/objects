&#xD;
K - meata-framing is a question of ground. Competing grammars are mutually exclusive, i.e. using one pushed the other down.

Even programs labeled as community owned still follow standard models, no real control of means of energy production
Walker, Lancaster University, Dept of Geography, 8
(Gordon, “What are the barriers and incentives for community-owned means of energy production and use?”, Energy Policy36(2008)4401–4405)sbl

Community renewable energy has long been advocated, particularly by alternative technology activists, as 
AND
growing scale and diversity of local-level activity (Adams. 2008).

Can’t solve renewable shift

2,795 is five times 565. That&amp;#39;s how the story ends.¶ 


K – 2NC
2NC: ROJ/ROB Wall


Paradigmatic analysis means you ignore the content of the 1AC text and focus on the unspoken absences or the questions are left unasked. 

Chandler 9 (Daniel, Lecturer in Media Theory at the University of Wales, Aberystwyth, Ph.D from the University of Wales, http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Documents/S4B/sem05.html, Acc: 10/24/12, og)

Whereas syntagmatic analysis studies the &amp;#39;surface structure&amp;#39; of a text, paradigmatic analysis seeks to 
AND
analysis pays particular attention to the issue of which questions are left unasked.


Use your ballot as an act of “self-relinquishment” - foreclose any desire to affirm or use Settler power or grammar – treat it like a stolen car
Myers 5
(Jeffrey, Associate Professor English, Manhattan College, Converging Stories: Race, Ecology, and Environmental Justice in American Literature, p.139-141)sbl

Lakota writer and critic Elizabeth Cook-Lynn characterizes &amp;#34;the deliberate theft of a

one that is as involved in the social world as in the wilderness. 

Impacts

2NC Impact Framing - Stage

Red and Black ontological violence comes first - it is the stage for all other violent conflicts and political discourse

Wilderson 10 Frank B. III, Ph.D., Associate Professor at UC Irvine, Red, White and Black: Cinema and the Structure of U.S. Antagonisms, pages 29-31, OG

The three structuring positions of the United States (Whites, Indians, Blacks) 
AND
is known in psychoanalysis as repetition compulsion and the return of the repressed. 


Link Wall

Incentives Link

Plan provides incentives on stolen lands, BUT those incentives can’t even be accessed by tribes

Shahinian 8 (Mark, J.D. and M.S. in Environment and Natural Resources from University of Michigan, “THE TAX MAN COMETH NOT”, Lexis, og)edited for ableist language

&amp;#34;The power to tax involves the power to destroy,&amp;#34; has become a shibboleth 
AND
S. policy, and also will better provide for tribal economic development.

Tribes are barred from tax credits, and even if they get they can’t use it

Tribally owned projects, however, can not utilize the tax credits, nor can

Prisons lead to extinction – devolves American democracy into endless vengeful wars

Brown 5 Michelle, professor and criminologist in the Department of Sociology and Anthropology at Ohio University, “Setting the Conditions for Abu Ghraib,”

Abu Ghraib, like Guantánamo and other U.S. military prisons, marks 
AND
repetition whose limits are defined currently only in the possibility of sheer exhaustion.




2NC AT Essentialism 

No link AND turn – we don’t make any claims about black culture, but HISTORICAL LIVED EXPERIENCE and POLITICS. Calling us essentialist is a RACIST move that STOPS black freedom and progress – independent voter

Birt 5 (Robert, graduated from Morgan State University in 1976 with BA degrees in History and Philosophy, and obtained his Ph.D. in Philosophy in 1984. Doctoral thesis was written on Alienation in the Later Philosophy of Jean-Paul Sartre. Dr. Birt has taught philosophy at Tuskegee University, Saint Joseph&amp;#39;s University, Texas A and M University, Morgan State University before joining the faculty of Bowie State University in August of 2007, “Blackness and the Quest for Authenticity”, in White on white/black on black / edited by George Yancy, p. 269-270, og)

But the affirmation of black consciousness and identity, of black solidarity¶ and community

Cooption DA - must push away from the 1AC to solve – independent reason to vote Neg

Alfred 99 Taiaiake, U of Victoria dir. of Indigenous Governance Program, Peace, Power, Righteousness, p79 
Freeing ourselves from co-optation comes down to acknowledging the unbalanced power relation that 
AND
trust where it belongs: in indigenous people, relationships, and structures.


1NR – Alt Solvency - Tinker

Counterplan INDEPENDENTLY SOLVES extinction – causes consumption shift, global modeling, and sustainability

Tinker 96 (George E, PhD, a member of the Osage Nation, and is also on the leadership council of the American Indian Movement of Colorado, professor of American Indian cultures and religious traditions at the Iliff School of Theology, “Defending mother earth”, ed. Jace Weaver, p. 171-72, og)

My suggestion that we take¶ the recognition of indigenous sovereignty as a priority¶ 
AND
is not simply just; the survival of all may depend on it.

AT: Reform/State Good

Reform, democracy, state institutional action is useless for Indians AND only strengthens ontological and literal destruction

Byrd 11 (Jodi A., (Chickasaw), assistant professor of American Indian studies and English at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, The Transit of Empire: Indigenous Critiques of Colonialism, pg. xvii)

There is more than one way to frame the concerns of The Transit of Empire
