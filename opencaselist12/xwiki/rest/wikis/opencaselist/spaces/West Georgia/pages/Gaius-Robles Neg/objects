1NC – Capitalism K 
Their lack of discussion of the material relations surrounding energy is an explicit decision to discursively separate capital from expanding energy production- energy shortages have created a cross road in capitalist relations and the affirmative is a step in the wrong direction- Abramsky 12(Kolya, Research Fellow at the IAS-STS Institute for Advanced Studies on Science, Technology, and Society, social activist,  “Sparking a Worldwide Energy Revolution: Social struggles in the transition to a Post-Petrol world,” 13- 14, VR)
Whether for pragmatic or ideological reasons, it is common to downplay the centrality of ANDand production based on the pursuit of values that are alternative to capital’s.  
\\Environmentalism is nothing more than the management of a crisis state to prevent radical movements- accepting the coming disaster the 1ac outlines creates fissures in the system that make way for radical alternatives that stand a chance of solving the impact- The Invisible Committee 7(Anonymous revolutionary organization originating in France, engaged in anti- civilizational revolutionary strategies- attributed to 9 revolutionaries in Tarnac France that organized disruptions of the train system and created a localized farming and living initiative in rural France.  Their capture and subsequent arrest has brought on media attention and accussations of terrorism – a case the French government is using this text to prove.  “The Coming Insurrection,” 80-4, VR) Everything about the environmentalists&amp;#39; discourse must be turned upside-down. Where they talk AND, while we dream of an age that is equal to our passions.
And, the negative position is one of unflinching rejection of the act of knowledge production that the 1ac instantiated- we embrace the fissures in capital that the crisis scenarios of the affirmative attempt to resolve and use the 1nc as an active of revolutionary resonance-  The Invisible Committee 7(Anonymous revolutionary organization originating in France, engaged in anti- civilization struggle, “The Coming Insurrection,” VR) 
Revolutionary movements do not spread by contamination but by resonance. Something that is constituted ANDto seek out a financial trail, a leader, or a snitch.¶ 
\\The environment has been crafted into a catastrophe- their impact construction is nothing more than a short term band aid on the abyss of endless capitalist production- The Invisible Committee 7(Anonymous revolutionary organization originating in France, engaged in anti- civilizational revolutionary strategies- attributed to 9 revolutionaries in Tarnac France that organized disruptions of the train system and created a localized farming and living initiative in rural France.  Their capture and subsequent arrest has brought on media attention and accussations of terrorism – a case the French government is using this text to prove.  “The Coming Insurrection,” 73-4, VR) Ecology is the discovery of the decade. For the last thirty years we&amp;#39;ve left ANDabout the latest prognosis of the disaster, to patiently compile its encyclopedia.¶ 
\\The scenario of economic collapse ignores that we are already living in a permanent state of economic crisis- nothing more than fear mongering masking as economic order- The Invisible Committee 7(Anonymous revolutionary organization originating in France, engaged in anti- civilizational revolutionary strategies- attributed to 9 revolutionaries in Tarnac France that organized disruptions of the train system and created a localized farming and living initiative in rural France.  Their capture and subsequent arrest has brought on media attention and accussations of terrorism – a case the French government is using this text to prove.  “The Coming Insurrection,” 63-7, VR) Thirty years of &amp;#34;crisis,&amp;#34; mass unemployment and flagging growth, and they still ANDwhile at the same time establishing the framework for a &amp;#34;new economy.&amp;#34;
\\1nc – Fantasy K
The aff is a fantasy document meant to symbolically plan and resolve a disaster. However, this process produces the harms they isolate while crafting a system of rationality that necessitates endless wars
Dudely 7Michael, Research Associate with the Institute of Urban Studies at the University of Winnipeg, Theory and Event, 10:2, Revisiting Cold War Ideology in the Secure City: Towards a Political Economy of Urbicide
20. In his 1999 book, Mission Improbable: Using Fantasy Documents to Tame ANDmany fronts that any foray beyond received conventional wisdom is viewed as unthinkable.¶ 
The aff replicates their harms, by normalizing danger and shielding bankrupt policy models, while enabling elite control, by stifling broad-based discussion and spreading complacency. Explicitly rejecting the aff is a honest admission which exposes the fantasy and spurs meaningful education
Clarke 99Lee, Prof of Sociology @ Rutgers , Mission Improbable: Using Fantasy Documents To Tame Disaster, pg. 167-171A short while ago I claimed that experts tend to face down impossible problems. ANDcould admit their limitations, declaring frankly that they can not control the uncontrollable
The aff’s focus on contrived nuclear war scenarios destroys policy decision-making, topic education, and academic relevancy 
Povinelli 85 (Danny Povinelli, PhD from Yale University, Regents Professor of Science and founder of the Cognitive Evolution Group at the University of Louisiana, former NDT debater at University of Massachusetts, http:~/~/groups.wfu.edu/debate/MiscSites/DRGArticles/Povinelli1985Water.htm, Acc: 8/25/12, og) “Debate is catastrophe. It begins and ends as calamity on a global scaleAND.e., educational) and profitable (i.e., competitive).
\\The ballot is key - Our discursive practices have material and political consequences, and are the only real power we have as a community. Since ballots are debate currency, and you should strategically deploy your ballot in this space and reject complacency
