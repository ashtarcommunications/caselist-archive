Marjane Ambler interjects: 
The discovery of millions of dollars in energy minerals beneath several Indian reservations in the United States presents one of the great ironies of history. From the pioneer farmers&amp;#39; perspective the sites chosen for Indian reservations in the late nineteenth century generally were wastelands that safely could be promised as &amp;#34;permanent&amp;#34; homelands. No one predicted the extent of the underground wealth or how much it would change the lives of the Indian people living over it.

1AC Advantages: &#xD;
&#xD;
Red Pedagogy - affirms the right to self sovereignty and to exist.&#xD;
Red Pedagogy reveals U.S. has colonialist relationship to Native Americans.&#xD;
The tribes should regulate the production of energy within their territories.&#xD;

Native sovereignty and the affirmative&amp;#39;s advocacy of deconstruction breaks down settlerism.&#xD;
&#xD;
Plan/Advocacy: We should remove energy restrictions on Native American production.&#xD;
&#xD;
2AC Strat:&#xD;
Case - they misunderstood the aff, all their paternalism is unresponsive, 1NC not responsive, they concede impact of destruction of the native body by bare life, exploiting tribes to justify restrictions is more racist, DOI argument non-responsive. Settlerism/colonialism is not imperialism, and settlerism/colonialism predate bare life.&#xD;
&#xD;
Framewrok/T - we meet because aff said remove restrictions. CI, aff must remove or reduce USFG restrictions. Shoul --&amp;#62; obligation to act. Aff does have a plan. There form of condescension is a form of whiteness.&#xD;
&#xD;
Red Pedagogy K - no link, the 1AC is practice, not ivory tower theory. Calderone is wrong, red pedagogy solves. Perm do both. Perm do all non-comp parts.&#xD;
Wind DA - no link, don&amp;#39;t remove restrictions on wind. Even if risk of DA, doesn&amp;#39;t justify settlerism and colonialism. Impacts are non-unique, wind development happening in squo.&#xD;
1AR:&#xD;
Case/K - The RoB that best performs red pedagogy. Their renewable energy evidence is just a way to maintain settlerism/colonialism. Their evidence is about post-colonialism which does not apply to the aff. The concede Grander, extend perm do both.&#xD;
&#xD;
T - Extend Ci, the aff should be resolved that the USFG should reduce restrictions. Aff must defend a reduce of restriction, which we meet. No external impact to extra T. CI - energy production includes competition. If they don&amp;#39;t go for framework, turn is a voter.&#xD;
&#xD;
2AR Offense:&#xD;
T - concediing aff is topical means game over for neg.&#xD;
&#xD;
Case - neg conceded framework, so no impact to Neg. All of their arguments are problematic because only winning non-unique case turns. The Neg conceded red pedagogy voter. Rifkin indicates squo is bad because government reduces Native Americans to bare life through energy restrictions. They have not made an argument that is A - unique, and B - links to the aff.There is no-uniqueness for the impact coming off of corporate control. All their evidence is in the context of renewables, thus no link to the affirmative. Don&amp;#39;t have external impact to tribal governments might be wrong.&#xD;

In this round your role as judge is to facilitate Red Pedagogy. Red Pedagogy is an educational praxis that combines indigenous knowledge and critical theory to create decolonized classroom spaces and invigorate political agency. Red Pedagogy is NOT an end-point but a self-reflexive process. The 1AC is an example of Red Pedagogy in action when applied to the resolutional question.

From the standpoint of Red pedagogy, the primary lesson in all of this is

AND

soul of America, so too does the more hopeful spirit of indigeneity.

 

 

Red Pedagogy revealed to us that the United States relationship to Indians is organized around the Settler Colonial management of life. The anxious desire to control the Indian Other results in exceptional and racist violence BUT under the guise of federal care and dependency.

In the context of the resolution, the Department of Interior’s approval requirement is a restriction on Indian energy production. This restriction should be removed because it is racist Settler control and exploitation of Indian sovereignty masked as care. Removing the restriction allows Indians to make the final decision about energy development.

However, in our drive to find Blackness within the resolution we were confounded by the presence and absence of Indianness in the resolution and more importantly in our conversations. So we decided to do something about it. 

We—very much like the rest of the community—cut a Indian wind aff, complete with tax credits, financial incentives, tribal economy advantages, and zero federal government key warrant. Then we stripped the financial incentives aff and picked a solvency mechanism to reform or abolish the TERA process, much like Northwestern KM’s kritikal aff. We wanted to tack on a hegemony advantage, but we were too slow. 

We have now come to realize that our writing and thinking process, albeit well-intended, occurred from within the Settler perspective. This may come as a surprise to you. Can two Black cats from the inner city really perform as Settlers? Bonita Lawrence and Enakshi Dua convinced us that people of color can indeed be settlers, because they “live on land that is appropriated and contested”. Yes, two Black cats, can “participate in … ongoing colonization”. 

We as Black debaters were complicit in Settlerism for two reasons. First, we sought to interpolate the Indian into civil society’s smooth functioning. Frank Wilderson says that this process of interpolation is “both devastating and parasitic”. It weakens the radical demands of Indians and forces them into a rubric which assumes the federal government can throw some tax credits at the issue. It reduces the Indian body to “a host on which … which the collective ego of Settler civil society can be monumentalized.” 

The second reason why we performed as Settlers is because we refused to recognize the intrinsic connection between Indianness and Blackness. We really thought that we could be separate them into neat little categories for analysis. We did not recognize, in our youthful zeal, that Wilderson’s book is called “Red, White, and Black”. The importance of this can be found in the first few pages where he says:

The three structuring positions … &amp;#34;intra-settler discussions.&amp;#34;


He continues, describing the contemporary moment:

The irreconcilable demands embodied in the &amp;#34;Savage&amp;#34; … and &amp;#34;diversity&amp;#34;—


After reaching a more proper understanding of our current situation and our embodied situation as Black folk, we returned to the resolution. Upon return we found something striking—the USFG functions as a Settler when dealing with Indian energy production. Who coulda-woulda have thunk it?

Marjane Ambler provided us with historical context asserting that: “The discovery of millions of dollars in energy minerals beneath several Indian reservations in the United States presents one of the great ironies of history.” In order to access these natural resources, the Federal Government established and sedimented it’s trust relationship. Eric Henson and Jonathan Taylor, professors at Harvard’s JFK School of Government, taught us that the USFG enacted restrictions to hinder “the ability to utilize those resources” and make choices about energy production. 

According to Henson and Taylor, in the status quo, the Department of the Interior “as the trustee, must approve leases involving the use of Indian-owned resources.”  Ironically, DOI, “the agency that is responsible for protecting Native interest… is also the agency that is obligated to promote non-Native development interest.” This web of restriction and promotion has resulted in “bureaucratic hurdles” and mismanagement of “revenues derived from Indian-owned resources”. Garritt Voggesser, citing an official report from the Linowes Commission, calls the process one of “outright theft” in which non-Indian energy companies are allowed to “operate essentially on an honor system”. 

This is not just about money or resources. Energy restrictions are part of what Mark Rifkin documents as the management and federal care of Indians as bodies by the Settler state. Indians are simultaneously within and outside the nation and law. Indians are brought into the legal regime when their resources and flesh are needed, and then cast out. This infringement of sovereignty, which Sandy Grande defines as the right to “exist and present … gifts to the world”, places creates a state of exception that allows for benevolent control and justified massacres of Indians. 

With regards to the resolution, we are resolved that the United States Federal Government should substantially reduce topical restrictions on Indian energy development, specifically by removing the requirement for DOI approval.

Our 1AC discussion should be thought of within what Sandy Grande calls Red Pedagogy. She says Red Pedagogy is a reflexive praxis “that interrogates both democracy and indigenous sovereignty” and allows for the “hopeful spirit of indigeneity” decolonize the classroom space. According to Grande” teachers and students…must be willing to act as agents of transgression, posing critical questions and engaging dangerous discourse.” Our pedagogy cannot be politically neutral because “we are poised to raise yet another generation in a nation at war and at risk”. The 1AC is not an end-point, but an ongoing praxis of decolonization.

Therefore, your role as a judge is to reward practices and knowledge production within this space that further decolonization.

Our approach to pedagogy is inherently one of solidarity. Our pedagogy of solidarity, according to Ruben Gaztambide-Fernandez, is not “a solution, but … a mode through which to engage in decolonizing practices”… This requires articulating decolonization…as a ‘common interest’ that unites racialized and Indigenous people across their differences in solidary struggle.”

In the context of Blacks and Indians, Grande says that “their shared positionality as subordinate groups in the United States maps a terrain of common experience. Like black students…Indian students find themselves in white-controlled institutions with agendas of assimilation and therefore vulnerable to the hegemonic norms of identity.” Black students should, always already, be in solidarity with Indian struggle against Settlerism.

Beginning the discussion with an investigation of our position as Black debaters is intentional and vital. It uniquely accesses a decolonizing pedagogy because it incorporates ethno-auto-biography. Ethnoautobiography, according to Robert Jackson-Paton, “intentionally and explicitly foregrounds identity with complexity and integrity”. It “grounds itself in the ethnic, cultural, historical, ecological, and gender background of the author” and ties it to structural and historical analysis. Embracing embodied feelings allows us to get beyond grief, denial and guilt. Ethnoautobiography “opens … spaces that encourage recovering participation, transformative identities, unorthodox narratives … and reconciliatory renewal. These spaces are fluid, challenging, and open-ended; they are inhabited by the shadow, repressed identities, and unconscious denials. Such a research methodology moves the inquirer into an underworld of transformative possibility.”

The blues clip that we play is also instrumental. Our performance of the blues is an embodied method which accounts for the historical connection between Blacks and Indians. Jodi Byrd, a Chickasaw and assistant professor of American Indian studies the University of Illinois, argues that “Southeastern Indian stomp dance music with the other musical influences … gave birth to the blues.” The blues emerges from interaction between escaped slaves and Indians who hid them and thus facilitated “syncretic exchanges” between “racial and colonial identities”. Put simply, our playing of the blues creates “a vibrant soundscape here in this room through which to re-imagine community that transcends the current limitations of a landscape mapped and owned through colonization”.

==== One of the greatest lies told of the Status Quo is that the 13th amendment abolished Slavery. It did not. Rather, it carved out the exception of criminal punishment by which involuntary servitude could legitimately be enforced. Recognizing this fact is crucial to understanding the role of the modern Prison Industrial Complex in furthering Anti-Blackness. The history of Black prison labor, including in the area of energy production, helps explain how the transition from Plantation to Penitentiary occurred. ====

==== Status Quo restrictions requiring prison-made renewable energy sources be used in the transition to a ‘greener USFG’ thus puts the Climate DA in the same league as the Cotton Biz Con DA of the 1850’s – the pain and suffering of Black and Brown bodies becomes the sacrifice necessary for the maintenance of the “civilization” created by White Supremacy. By now, our relationship with the Resolution and its Affirmation should be clear – our previous scholarship in the area of Anti-Blackness helps reveal how energy production in the US is always already informed by the structural racism of white supremacy, thus we are rightfully skeptical of calls for a ‘greener’ economy that do not properly account for how ‘anti-blackening’ distorts and corrupts such efforts. ====

==== To reject the restrictions on energy production supporting the Prison Industrial Complex is to contest the relationship between involuntary servitude and energy policy reform and to affirm removal of these restrictions is to pull apart current connections between a Green Economy and Anti-Blackness. ====
