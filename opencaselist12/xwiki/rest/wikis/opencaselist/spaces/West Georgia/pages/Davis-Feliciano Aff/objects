(% style=&amp;#34;font-family:Times New Roman, serif;&amp;#34; %)What does it mean on an energy topic where debate attempts to find the latest solution to our energy crisis and children cant read the fine print on their bill. Detroit stands as a symbol of industrial wealth and decadence for America&amp;#39;s golden years of production. The location of the Fermi Fast Breeder Reactor came as a golden beacon, the new wave of Nuclear technology launching the Western world into a Jetson’s aspired future. The rush to a plan of action assumes we know what we are struggling against, that we have a strong grasp on the issue, but the consensus is wrong there is no vocabulary, no grammar that can allow the question of the resolution to make sense in the larger story of black suffering.

(% style=&amp;#34;font-family:Times New Roman, serif;&amp;#34; %)The social polity, and policy framings advanced in this year’s resolution evaluate our environmental issues as purely conservation and preservation; there is a need to increase production to reduce emissions and continue the lifestyle that America has become accustomed to. However, this call to action ignores that there is the complexion for protection in this country and around the world

The Fermi project would not have been possible without extensive government aid. Detroit Edison was on welfare throughout production with free design research, cheap processed fuel, waste storage and a government promise to buy the plutonium produced. Even though it was claimed “that building such a plant would endanger at least three million people in a thirty mile radius around the plant,&amp;#34; in the midst of 40 nuclear accidents occurring prior to the construction period of Fermi, no one stopped to think about the babies, or the people’s survival, everything was on a need to know basis, which was code for waiting years to fully decommission the plant and ensure “ some level of safety.” Information about the faulty cooling valve construction was considered a threat to national security, and thus not disclosed.  Over 30 years later and hundreds of miles away from Motown, the town of Shell Bluff, GA has been selected as the centerpiece for a burgeoning nuclear age, chosen to house two Westinghouse Reactors. Obama gave the head nod to Southern Company and more than $8 billion dollars in federal money to build these new reactors. But the people of Burke County already have two power plants Vogtle 1 and 2, an old weapons manufacturing company that’s been marked as  a Superfund toxic site. They have enough nuclear energy and waste to last them a lifetime, but with high cancer rates, and the energy being sold to other states they will never feel the benefits. The promise of jobs is supposed to ameliorate these deplorable living conditions, except that rap isn’t new to the Bluff residents, they’ve been promised jobs and a government ear to listen to, with only Jesus sitting idly by.  Obama believes Nuclear will push America through the dark days of the energy and environmental crisis, but what’s an energy crisis to a single mother fighting for her lights to be turned on, or struggling to pay her and her family’s hospital bills? Putting more energy in the grid doesn’t stop the NRC from accepting more members into their country club of nuclear propaganda; doesn’t stop them from refusing to test the ground water near you. What about the Shell Bluff crisis?  The double bind of burke country residents: they are dying from cancer, and yet cant get any help because the nuclear regulatory commission refuses to do any testing in that area and constantly denies or ignores their requests tot test the ground, their water is slowly disappearing, and nothing to do about it. No one is listening but Jesus. No information disclosed. There is no public-private life when both those are sutured by a refusal to acknowledge a decaying population. That’s not right! We should call out the NRC for everything: hold those responsible accountable instead of digging in the pockets of USFG to try and claim that bankrupt loot. Companies are allowed to build without any regard for the community they decide to occupy, and especially no regard for black sentient life. 
The problem is structural: as Black suffering establishes the white macro body politic tries to ignore and justify the health of the body ignoring the dark spaces of the body. A resolution dealing with energy production and the main goals advance the interests of the industry the people, white flesh over black Debates silence on community involvement and secrecy surrounding licensing is the logic justifying the reproduction of that exclusive white macro body leaving the residents of Burke County lacking the complexion for protection they are left to dwell in the sacrificial zones of Black Trash.
