Nanobots must be powered by radioactive decay

Sagar 6 T.Vidya Sagar 6&amp;#39; III b.tech I semester, Dept. Of mechanical Engineering Prasad v. Potluri Siddhartha Institute of Technology Kanuru, Vijayawada, India. http://share.pdfonline.com/f40486d760094b56b1705677fa146e58/medical%20nanobots.htm 

..nanobots can work on brain research, cancer research, and many other diseases. Nanobots can be easily injected into the body. Traditionally, most robots have a solar cell or some kind of battery pack, but obviously these are too large for nanobot. However, the answer may lie in nuclear technology. Due to nanobots equipped with thin film of radioactive material, nanobots will be able to fuel themselves on particles released by decaying atoms. Silicon is strong enough to last and conduct electricity….

Each Nanobot is an SMR – NRC Regulates

NRC 12&amp;#39; http://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/nrc-slides-who-we-are.pdf 

The Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 established the NRC to independently regulate commercial uses of nuclear material, including nuclear power; other duties of the former Atomic Energy Commission were assigned to the Department of  Energy.

One is to create the nanomaterials that are specifically tailored to thwart radiation penetration of the spacecraft. Then there is the nanotechnology sensors to better characterize the radiation levels

Earth will collapse now – Multiple reasons:

A) Super volcanoes threaten earth at any moment 

Armageddon Online 9 Armageddon Online, Super Volcano Compilation - A deadly Look. January 10, 2009 http://www.armageddononline.org/Super-Volcano-Compilation.html

…..Sooner or later, geologists warn, a &amp;#34;super volcano&amp;#34; will strike. Some scientists in this field will even go so far as to say that phenomena like this one pose a greater threat than terrorism. When will one next erupt? Scientist have discovered that the ground in Yellowstone is over 70cm higher than in was in 1923 - indicating a massive swelling underneath the park. The reservoir is filling with magma at a staggering rate..


That causes extinction.  

Britt 5 Robert Roy Britt. Super Volcano Will Challenge Civilization, Geologists Warn, live science.com. March 8, 2005 http://www.livescience.com/environment/050308_super_volcano.html

….&amp;#34;An area the size of North America can be devastated, and pronounced deterioration of global climate would be expected for a few years following the eruption,&amp;#34; Self said. &amp;#34;They could result in the devastation of world agriculture, severe disruption of food supplies, and mass starvation. These effects could be sufficiently severe to threaten the fabric of civilization.&amp;#34;



B) Inevitable asteroid impact is coming that will cause human extinction

Plait 8 Philip Plait, is an astronomer and skeptic who runs the website BadAstronomy.com. He formerly worked at the physics and astronomy department at Sonoma State University and President of the James Randi Educational Foundation. Death from the Skies, 2008 p. 14-19

Sixty-five million years ago, the dinosaurs had a really bad day. Actually, recent findings show they were having a bad couple of million years. There are indications that the Earth’s climate had been changing, and many species were already in decline. However, there is overwhelming evidence that a great number of species indeed died practically overnight on a geological time scale. It’s now a matter of scientific fact that this event was triggered by the impact of a six- mile-wide asteroid—and at that size, the word “meteoroid” is seriously inadequate. It was certainly large enough to do the trick. The mind boggles to think of the devastation wrought when a rock bigger than MountEverest plummeted through the atmosphere and hit the Earth at ten miles per second. Imagine: when the surface of the asteroid contacted the ground, the far side was still sticking out above most of the Earth’s atmosphere. The exact energy of the impact is difficult to know, but it would have been hundreds of millions of megatons—far. far larger than the heftiest nuclear bomb ever detonated. In fact, even if you detonated every single nuclear weapon on Earth simultaneously, the explosion generated by the impact of the dinosaur killer would have been a million times more powerful . . . all concentrated in one spot….

, but our own day may yet come.

C) Undead – The risk is real – parasites can take control of hosts now

Parasites that turn victims into mindless, zombie-like slaves are fairly common in nature. There&amp;#39;s one called toxoplasmosa gondii that seems to devote its entire existence to being terrifying.  This bug infects rats, but can only breed inside the intestines of a cat… 

This causes extinction

D) Overpopulation – By 2050 humanity will overshoot causing extinction

Sir Shridath Ramphal, co chairperson the commission on Global governance. Where is the Ticking Time-bomb ticking? Population and Global Security, edited Nicholas Polunin 1998 p.87-88

To succeed in doing we would have to preempt in the process, other animal life in a desperate human scramble to enlarge land cultivation and annexe all its product for ourselves. Science and technology may increase the solar-powered productivity of Nature’s plants, but we are also cutting back production as desertification. urban growth, highways and runways soil erosion and pollution, all steadily decrease The extent of Earth is green cover and likewise its food-building potentiality. In any event, after taking anything like that suggested 80% of Earth’s life-sustaining material around AD 2050, Humankind would not be far from the absolute limit of 100%. Like a plague of locusts, we would have eaten ourselves ‘out of house and home’. Like locust we would move on but the only thing left ‘for us would be aquatic plant life which our prosing technologies would turn to human use, though most likely they would succeed in providing no more than fractional relief. Of course, well before our continental Food-stores ran out, men, women, and children, would have become embroiled in a primitive internecine struggle for survival — a struggle over consumption and the materials to maintain it which would pale into tiny proportions the civil and other wars and local - ,conflicts that already rage in so many parts of our increasingly overpopulated world.

How the government meets that requirement, as long as it is done within established safety guidelines, should be irrelevant to the NRC.
