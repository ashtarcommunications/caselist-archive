Today, many states

Plan Text
United States Congress should abandon the waste confidence rule, remove the mandate that specific nuclear technologies be wedded to specific plant design, and pass legislation that rescinds the part of Clinton’s Presidential Directive 13 that forbids the commercial reprocessing and 
recycling of spent nuclear fuel.

AND Solvency
We solve in four ways:
First, tech neutrality – Congress Must remove NRC mandate that specific technology be wedded to specific plant designs~-~- this is key to new nuclear tech

And, NRC is customer driven, regulatory uncertainty prevents nuclear development because companies can&amp;#39;t predict results

Establish a new

Second way we solve is voiding Presidential Directive 8~-~- this is critical to allow nuclear recycling

Third way we solve is removing the waste confidence rule which is used to prevent new licensure
