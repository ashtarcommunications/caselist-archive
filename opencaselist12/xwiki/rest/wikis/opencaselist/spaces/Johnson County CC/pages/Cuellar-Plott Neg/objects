It is now estimated that about twenty-five countries are in a position to make

 

AND

of the past to be the same as the pattern in the future, in which one or two states per decade gradually develop nuclear weapons.

 

==== Demand-side pressures ensure prolif is slow-nuclearization is not appealing for most states ====

 

Erik **Gartzke** **and** Dong-**Joon Jo** April **2009** (Bargaining, Nuclear Proliferation, and Interstate Disputes, Journal of Conflict Resolution, Vol. 53 Issue 2, pp 209-233)

 

__If proliferation is a collective action problem__, however, __many more states should have proliferated__

 

AND

__enough to believe that major change is __possible and beneficial, nuclear weapons are not a practical option.

 

==== History is on our side – nuclear states don’t go to war with each other and prolif deescalates former tensions ====

 

Mueller 98 John, Professor of Political Science at the UNC-Chapel Hill, &amp;#34;The Escalating Irrelevance of Nuclear Weapons,&amp;#34; The Absolute Weapon Revisited, ed. Paul, Harknett, and Wirtz, p. 83cn

 

Therefore, although there may be some imaginable circumstances under which nuclear

 

AND

a nuclear attack on an enemy city could appeal to an appropriately fanatical leader as the ultimate in ethnic cleansing. 

 

==== 1) Chemical/Biological Weapons ====

==== Regional nuclear proliferation prevents CBW warfare ====

 Dr. Keith B. **Payne**, President, National Institute for Public Policy Faculty, Georgetown University School of Foreign Service National Security Studies Program, April **1998**__ __“Why We Must Sustain Nuclear Deterrence,” http:~~/~~/www.nipp.org/Adobe/Op%20Ed%203_20_98.pdfurl:http://www.nipp.org/Adobe/Op%20Ed%203_20_98.pdf

 

A single illustration of the lethality of biological weapons will clarify why

 

AND

__as CBW proliferates __our **__nuclear capabilities become__**__ more, not less **important for regional deterrence**.__

 

==== Biological weapons cause mutated and uncontrolled pathogens, culminating in extinction ====

 John **Steinbruner**, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, chair of the committee on international security and arms control of the National Academy of Sciences, Foreign Policy, December 22, **1997**

 

That deceptively simple observation has immense implications. The use of a manufactured weapon is a singular event.

 

AND

The 1918 influenza epidemic demonstrated the potential for a global contagion of this sort but not necessarily its outer limit.

==== 2) Extended Deterence ====

==== American extended deterrence is not credible – Cold War illustrated the difficulty of guaranteeing security to a country or area not intrinsic to U.S. security~*~** ====

Christopher **Layne **(Associate Professor in the Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas AandM University) **2006** “The Peace of Illusions” p 165-7

 

During the cold war, the United States sought to deter a Soviet strategic nuclear attack on Western Europe by extending its strategic nuclear umbrella to cover its NATO allies

 

AND

rise to the same level of grand strategic importance for the United States as Western Europe purportedly did during the cold war.

 

==== Extended deterrence increases the chance of American involvement in nuclear war. ====

One of **the most important challenges facing U.S. leaders** in the post-Cold

the United States should distance itself from regional disputes that could go nuclear.
