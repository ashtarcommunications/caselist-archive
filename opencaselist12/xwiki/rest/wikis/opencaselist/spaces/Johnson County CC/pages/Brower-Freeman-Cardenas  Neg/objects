This debate is a question of what you choose to value when faced with the mutually exclusive options of increased production or decreased individual consumption.  It is an ethical question that precedes all utilitarian calculations.

The alternative is to reject the affirmative proposal of increased production in favor of prioritizing a reduction of individual consumption and ecological destruction. This is the only approach that will challenge our denial of individual guilt and responsibility.

University Contained Discourse on the  EXPLOITATIVE FUNCTION OF POWER merely Sustains Powers Ability to CONSTRAIN ANY type of Resistance by turning Victims of power into Ghosts,  This suspends any potential action while  Masking Power – ESPECIALLY in Academic Subcultures like Debate

Totally managed...the horror is thoughtless.

Your Preoccupation with challenging hegemonic power structures within a system that is itself a hegemonic power structure makes you live a social death.  You become a product and subservient to the systems you criticize. You are a cog in the machine and you don’t even realize it.

The alternative is to abandon the flawed methodological approach of the affirmative.  If we win a link then we will that their method leads to pacification and abandonment of any real change they hope to accomplish.  This means you could vote negative on presumption.  However, rejection forces a new methodological approach that will challenge the inertia that will inevitably result from their movement. The only hope of solving is to not accept the pacification and cooption the University creates surrounding  critical theory.

Our framework – debate should be a site for contest over political proposals. This requires that the affirmative present a predictable plan of action and defends that their policy should be adopted by the United States federal government. 

B. Our interpretation most predictable given the wording of the resolution:

1. The topic is defined by the phrase following the colon – the USFG is the agent of the resolution, not the individual debaters

 Webster’s Guide to Grammar and Writing – 2000  http://ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/marks/colon.htm
Use of ... capital letter.

2. “Resolved” expresses intent to implement the plan

American Heritage Dictionary 2000 www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=resolved
To find...successful conclusion

3. “Should” denotes an expectation of enacting a plan

 American Heritage Dictionary – 2000 www.dictionary.com
 3 Used to...or expectation

4. “The USFG” is the government in Washington D.C.

 Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2000 http://encarta.msn.com
 “The federal ...Washington DC.”

5. and, our definition excludes action by smaller political groups or individuals.
 
Black’s Law Dictionary Seventh Edition Ed. Bryan A. Garner (chief) 1999
Federal government...national political matters

C. Violation – The affirmative is not an instrumental affirmation of the resolution – they affirm the topic as 

D. Reasons to prefer - 

Personal Politics is Destructive: 
one of the core characteristics of debate that allows the activity so much room for innovation and education is its relative seclusion from society. This allows debaters to test ideas. If the framework of debate is changed to become an aggressively activist forum for challenging societal oppression then the politicization of the activity will destroy the educational benefit gained from the laboratory of ideas. The oppressive elites will have an incentive to infiltrate and destroy the activity.

Alan Coverstone, M.A. Speech Communication from Wake Forest University and Assistant Dean at Montgomery Bell Academy, 1995 (“An Inward Glance: A Response To Mitchell&amp;#39;s Outward Activist Turn” Debater’s Research Guide, http://groups.wfu.edu/debate/MiscSites/DRGArticles/Coverstone1995China.htm)
Second, Mitchell&amp;#39;s ...illustrate this idea

Predictable Ground: 
The negative could never prepare for all the potential combinations of link arguments to rhetoric, methodology, participation in debate norms, epistemology, ontology. This is especially problematic on the neg because we don’t have an affirmative to weigh against, which means we have to start at zero productive ground. Predictability comes before potential education because the game has to be fair for people to participate and gain the education.

Utopian Thinking Bad: 
A) Impossible to win- No plan is ideal when compared to perfection, it is unreasonable to expect the Affirmative to be able to win if compared to perfection. 

B) Education- This type of thinking does not teach us the problem solution skills necessary to engage the pragmatic problems that will face us throughout our lives. The skills gained by policy comparisons outweigh the kritik impacts because the kritik impacts presume the judge can compare and evaluate the impacts, which is a skill that is undermined by the affirmative’s utopian thinking. </headline></objectSummary></objects>
