The 1AC speech act critisizes the reductionist and technocentric nature of the resolution. The affirmative provides several examples of how technocentrism applies to the topic and why those examples are bad (for example, how the Southeastern region of the US contains disproportionally more nuclear power plants and how that is environmentally unjust. Another example explains why resource scarcity narratives are bad).

The 1AC concludes by stating that voting affirmative is a rejection of technocentrism and that technocentrism must be rejected in every instance, including both academia and policymaking. 

(The 1AC contains several quotes/citations of various authors, but does not contain any formal cards).</headline></objectSummary></objects>
