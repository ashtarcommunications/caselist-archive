Role of the ballot – the judge should vote for the team that makes takes the best ethical stance vis-à-vis the resolution.  Their framework mandates production, which masks the ethical problems presented in the 1AC.
2. Counter interpretation – debaters should respond to the resolution. And, we meet- the AFF responds by refusing the resolution.
3. It’s a reason to vote AFF- the Kellner evidence says we should re-conceptualize negativity as a positive act. Only the AFF can refuse the resolution, which means this argument cannot be run on the negative.

This is offense for us – their framework is repressive tolerance – a tactical move that fosters global violence. Our refusal is key.

 Colors of KU is a diversity conference held annually; it’s weekend long retreat aimed at promoting diversity and tolerance within the KU community. This year I attended the conference; there was one exercise in particular we engaged in that required us to make choices about who to exclude from dinner. I remember we had just finished a powerful session about discrimination when the dinner bell rang. As we all headed towards the dining hall we were greeted by two of the retreat’s staff: Cody and Mauritio. We lined up at the dining hall as usual – but something was different this time. Cody and Mauritio went down the line and assigned us, at random mind you, colors – red, blue, yellow, and green. I was assigned red. I didn’t know what it meant but I quickly found out as the doors opened and I was told I couldn’t go in. One by one Cody and Maurito pulled the red and yellow people out of line. We were told that we couldn’t go in, but we weren’t told why. Immediately we thought it was a joke, trying to go around to the side door we found other retreat staff blocking it. The people one the inside were told that they should go ahead and begin eating lunch. Many of them were hesitant; at first staring outside to see what was going on, why we weren’t coming in. After a while they began to eat lunch, averting their eyes and pretending that things were normal. Outside things were anything but. It was cold and we were hungry. After dinner was over, it was revealed that dinner had in fact been an exercise – we all had a choice to play. We should have refused to engage in this exercise where we were forced to make unethical choices about who gets to eat dinner - The unethical act was choosing to play. &#xD;

purpose¶ of getting a good paying job in the global workforce economy. &#xD;
This year’s debate topic is a version of “The Survival Game”.  The topic committee constructed a topic that assigns affirmative debaters in the classroom space to choose which energy to affirm or put in the lifeboat without questioning the inherent racist component of that lifeboat.  Affirmatives get to choose which energy is the least harmful instead of confronting the harm in all of them.  The fact that making those choices masks the underlying question of whether we should be endorsing the production of these energies at all is ignored as affirmative students make their choices.  The fact that each energy system places burdens on local populations who are effected by the energy choice they make is rendered invisibility.  Affirmative debaters all year take there assignment and try to pick the energy type that offers the most benefits and damages the fewest people in exactly the same way that students argue the benefits for putting particular people in the lifeboat.  Every choice is ultimately tragic.&#xD;

You should frame your decision in terms of pedagogical impact- using the debate space to criticize violent structures expands the boundaries of our consciousness and creates research practices that are more sensitive to slow, everyday violence- that’s a pre-requisite to effective use of science and empiricism

Many critics argue that care… relationship and interaction. 

Our plan is an academic intervention- it represents a historic and political act that links the history of racial violence in the United States to social disorder during disasters.

The United States federal government should procure mobile solar power systems from companies who comply with the Solar Industry Environment and Social Responsibility Commitment for its training exercises and activities in response to emergencies in the United States.
