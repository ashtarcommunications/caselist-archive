===Contention 1: Prolif===

====Inevitable expansion of nuclear power spurs proliferation====
**Bernstein and Gerami 12**
(Paul Bernstein, Senior Research Fellow in the Center for the Study of Weapons of Mass Destruction (CSWMD) at the National Defense University, and Nina Gerami, Research Fellow in CSWMD, June 2012, &amp;#34;Proliferation Risks of Civilian Nuclear Power Programs&amp;#34; http://wmdcenter.dodlive.mil/files/2012/06/CSWMD-Proceedings-3-FINAL.pdf)
The dual-use nature of the nuclear fuel cycle therefore poses an inherent proliferation 
AND
to the IAEA Additional Protocol, which grants the agency expanded inspection rights.

====New proliferators will develop offensive postures that increase the risk of conventional and nuclear conflict====
**Horowitz**, professor of poli sci, **9 **—Professor of Political Science at University of Pennsylvania (Michael Horowitz, &amp;#34;The Spread of Nuclear Weapons and International Conflict: Does Experience Matter?&amp;#34; Journal of Conflict Resolution, Volume 53 Number 2, April 2009 pg. 234-257)
This section focuses on how acquiring nuclear weapons influences both the new nuclear state and 
AND
to be effective, increasing the probability that an adversary will not reciprocate.

====Proliferation sparks wars that escalate to great power nuclear conflict====
**Below 08**

Proliferation. Roger Molander, of RAND Corporation, asserts that &amp;#34;in the near 
AND
which is subsequently escalated into nuclear warfare by its allies or their opponents.

====Finally, we outweigh your generic theoretical arguments—the risk that we are right in even a single instance easily dwarfs your generic prolif good arguments**====

~~Jeffrey, Department of National Security Affairs at Naval Postgraduate School, Security Studies, &amp;#34;Recasting the Proliferation Optimism-Pessimism Debate&amp;#34;, Oct. 2002~~
DEVELOPING AND testing theories are core tasks in the social sciences. Accordingly, social 
AND
nuclear use are too unpredictable to tempt us to run the experiment.&amp;#34;24

====SMR provides prolif resistance====
**King et al 11**
Marcus, LaVar Huntzinger • Thoi Nguyen, CNA, March, &amp;#34;Feasibility of Nuclear Power on U.S. Military Installations&amp;#34; https://cna.org/sites/default/files/research/Nuclear%20Power%20on%20Military%20Installations%20D0023932%20A5.pdf-https://cna.org/sites/default/files/research/Nuclear Power on Military Installations D0023932 A5.pdf
Many SMR designs and advanced concepts utilize extended core life to reduce refueling frequency. 
AND
will require the development and validation of appropriate control systems and humanmachine interfaces.

====SMR~’s are key to negotiation pressure for nonproliferation - they are more desirable than other nuclear systems====
**Sanders,** Associate Director Savannah National Lab, **~’12**
~~Tom Sanders, Associate Laboratory Director for Clean Energy Initiatives at the Savannah River National Laboratory, Department of Energy, Former President of the American Nuclear Society, &amp;#34;Tom Sanders: Great expectations for small modular reactors,&amp;#34; Nuclear News, July 2012, pg. 48-49~~
That~’s a good question. One of the things that concerned me most in the 
AND
with a large plant doesn~’t make any sense if you can~’t afford it.

====US leadership on SMRs is key to global nonproliferation efforts====
**Loudermilk 11**
(Micah Loudermilk, Research Associate for the Energy %26 Environmental Security Policy program with the Institute for National Strategic Studies at National Defense University, 5/31/11, &amp;#34;Small Nuclear Reactors and US Energy Security: Concepts, Capabilities, and Costs&amp;#34; http://www.ensec.org/index.php?option=com_content%26view=article%26id=314:small-nuclear-reactors-and-us-energy-security-concepts-capabilities-and-costs%26catid=116:content0411%26Itemid=375-http://www.ensec.org/index.php?option=com_content%26view=article%26id=314:small-nuclear-reactors-and-us-energy-security-concepts-capabilities-and-costs%26catid=116:content0411%26Itemid=375)
Reactor safety itself notwithstanding, many argue that the scattering of small reactors around the 
AND
reactors are mitigated and concerns over the widespread distribution of nuclear fuel allayed.

====DOD leadership prevents foreign dominance of nuclear energy and nonproliferation====
**Andres and Breetz 11**

====Grid breakdowns cause nuclear war====

The cyber threat to the DIB is only part of a much larger challenge to 
AND
system over which it does not – and never will – exercise control.

====Military power disruption ensures** **an invasion of Taiwan by creating a window of opportunity for China to strike while US forces are out of commission ====
**Gerson,** Research analyst at the Center for Naval Analyses, **09**
(Conventional Deterrence in the Second Nuclear Age http://www.carlisle.army.mil/usawc/parameters/Articles/09autumn/gerson.pdf)
Deterrence is once again a topic of discussion and debate among US defense and policy 
AND
if the regime believes it can accomplish its objectives before US forces respond.

====Preserving the perception of military effectiveness key—a weakened military invites aggression and rash wars====
**Feaver 3**
Professor of Political Science at Duke, Peter D., Armed Services: Agency, Oversight, and Civil-Military Relations, p.213
The civil-military problematique is so vexing because it involves balancing two vital and 
AND
leading them to rash behavior and then failing in the ultimate military contest.

====US will continue to pursue hegemony inevitably—it~’s only a question of whether those actions will be successful====
**Shalmon and Horowitz 9 **- * Senior Analyst at Lincoln Group * assistant professor of Political Science at The University of Pennsylvania
(Dan, Senior Analyst at Lincoln Group, LLC, Mike, assistant professor of Political Science at The University of Pennsylvania, as well as an FPRI scholar, Orbis, Spring)
It is important to recognize at the outset two key points about United States strategy 
AND

With the decline of America~’s global preeminence, weaker countries will be more susceptible to 
AND
extremism; a worldwide energy crisis; vulnerability of America~’s Persian Gulf allies.

====Any of these would escalate into great power wars—American retrenchment collapse current restraints  ====

America~’s decline: A harbinger of conflict and rivalry, http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2011/01/22/americas-decline-a-harbinger-of-conflict-and-rivalry/

forecast in a future that will inevitably be devoid of unrivalled US primacy.

March 2009. &amp;#34;Russia And Arms Control: Are There Opportunities For The Obama Administration?,&amp;#34; online: http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/pub908.pdf
Proliferators or nuclear states like China and Russia can then deter regional or intercontinental attacks 
AND
perhaps make wars of aggression on their neighbors or their own people.172

====And, their impact defense no longer applies.====

**Bostrom 2**

Renewable energy technologies have made great strides forward during the last decade. In an

Nuclear has enjoyed bipartisan support in Congress for more than 60 years, but the 
AND
and an entirely different regulatory framework to review and approve new commercial designs.

The &amp;#34;Valley of Death.&amp;#34; Given the promise that small reactors hold for military

====SMRs are cheap and can provide easy power to the US====

Roe Institute for Economic Policy Studies at the Heritage Foundation, and Nicolas Loris, Research Associate in the Roe Institute, at The Heritage Foundation, 2/2/11, &amp;#34;A Big Future for Small Nuclear Reactors?&amp;#34; http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2011/02/a-big-future-for-small-nuclear-reactors)
Why SMRs?
Small modular reactors share many of the attractive qualities of large reactors, such as 
AND
, engineering, and uranium enrichment capabilities—all in the United States.

====SMRs allow mass production – reduces costs====

(David Szondy, freelance writer, 2/16/12, &amp;#34;Feature: Small modular nuclear reactors - the future of energy?&amp;#34; http://www.gizmag.com/small-modular-nuclear-reactors/20860/)
SMRs have a number of advantages over conventional reactors. For one thing, SMRs 
AND
in remote, inland areas where it isn~’t possible to site conventional reactors.

====SMRs don~’t have accidents====
**Loudermilk ~’11**

Although large reactors possess a stellar safety record throughout their history of operation, SMRs 
AND
, an accident affecting one reactor would be limited to that individual reactor.


====SMRS solve waste====

SMRs can help with proliferation, nuclear waste and fuel supply issues because, while 
AND
it can provide power even to areas where security concerns have been raised.


====SMRs solve waste, radiation, and mining====
