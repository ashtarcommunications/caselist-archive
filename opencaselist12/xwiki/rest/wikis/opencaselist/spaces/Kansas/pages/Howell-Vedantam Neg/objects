Everyone acknowledges that electricity generated from wind and solar cannot be produced and delivered at prices that compete with coal or gas….. Yet this has not dissuaded the Department of Energy from smacking your money down. So, how is our Nobel Prize-winning high roller doing?

Warming
Even if solar managed to replace every coal plant in the world it would only reduce warming by .2 degrees

The variations on these themes are numerous. ….economic growth versus environmental protection, innovation versus safety, instant gratification versus future well-being.

Competing against globalization takes the development of technology out of our control and globally destroys the possibility of democracy

The concept of time is closely related to velocity…. depends to create economic prosperity, is rapidly declining, and the rate of loss is increasing proportionate to gains in material well being.

Unequal development is war conducted by other means – the global benefits of technology are used to both sustain and oppress.
Der Derian, and Virilio, 97 (James, Watson Institute research professor of international studies and professor of political science at Brown University,  and Paul, “Interview with Paul Virilio,” http://asrudiancenter.wordpress.com/2008/11/26/interview-with-paul-virilio/)

Will military technological superiority eventually efface these national and geographical differences? -…. as Marvin Minsky proposes. We are on the verge of the biomachine. Personally, I critique this, as the advent of the hyperstimulated man.


Waste Production- the need to produce quickly ensures environmental corner cutting- means unsustainable energy use and pollution creation 
Land ‘6
(University of Strathclyde, Glasgow) (Ray, Networked Learning and the Politics of Speed: a Dromological Perspective, Networked Learning 2006)
Adam (1998:69….  In his view ‘globalisation relates to the dromospheric greenhouse effect of confinement within the limit-acceleration of telecommunications’ (117). 


Organizing the economy around innovation creates economics of speed- leads to rapid investment shifting and product development- that’s unsustainable and makes financial collapse inevitable
Goldman et al. ‘6
 (Robert Goldman, Stephen Papson, Noah Kersey, Landscapes of the Social Relations of Production in a Networked Society, Fast Capitalism 2.1, http://www.uta.edu/huma/agger/fastcapitalism/2_1/SocialRelations.html)
The formula for success is knowledge, power, mobility, …. Speed may mean winning, but it can also lead to crashing. There are more losers than winners in casino capitalism. The landscape of risk is omnipresent. 

Turns case, Tech is the foundation of globalization 
– technology creates an empire of speed that destroys the natural world.
Adams, 03 (Jason, Masters Political Science, Popular Defense in the Empire of Speed: Paul Virilio and the Phenomenology of the Political Body,” November 2003)

The overall effect of this &amp;#39;national deconstruction&amp;#39; is that ….where once the polis inaugurated a political theater, with its agora and its forum, now there is only a cathode-ray screen, where the shadows and spectres of a community dance amid their processes of disappearance&amp;#34;.112

We have innovation specific evidence- slowing down allows companies to better consider ethical impacts of their products and creates a dialogic relationship with consumers that creates time for democratic discussion of economic conditions- that’s the only possibility of maximizing the benefits of innovation and avoiding environmental damage and economic instability
Giaretta ‘5
(Elena, Associate Professor in Economics @ University of Verona, “Ethical Product Innovation: In Praise of Slowness”, TQM Magazine, Vol. 17 No. 2, 2005)

Leaving aside any possible ethical issues…, speeding up at times of need (for example in moments of crisis when a product defect emerges) and slowing down and resting when required. By introducing moments of rest within the organisations may also represent an alternative environment in which attention can be better focused and the creative imagination has the opportunity to nourish itself.

The aff is a performance of credibility for the other—it centers political decisionmaking on how we believe other people perceive us. This constructs an ideology of deterrence that mediates our actions with other nations—this non-falsifiable method requires leaders to take the most drastic actions and re-entrenches the elite monopoly on knowledge
Marullo 85 (Sam, Professor of Sociology at Cleveland State University, “The Ideological Nature of Deterrence: Some Causes and Consequences” pg. 316-319 JSTOR) RF
An understanding of this paradox is obtained by analyzing the interests being served by this obfuscation, ….while statements more truly reflective of nuclear weapons employment policy are shared within the iron triangle and infrequently transmitted to the Soviet Union. Both, however, indicate a reliance on deterrence ideology. 

Wars are not isolated events or accidents. Instead, breakdowns are embedded in the very fabric of the international system itself and can only come out of the dangerous situation produced by deterrence. A “fog of war” ensures uncertainty in our knowledge of the other’s belief, The aff obscures our role in producing situations of danger and creating the conditions for violence.
Chaloupka ’92, (William, Chair of Political Science @ Colorado State, Knowing Nukes, pgs. 12-16)
Even our best signs of stability are easily inverted into signs of chaos and entropy. The only dependable stasis refuses to be static; interpretation de- mands a role, despite our wishes it would recede. This absurd outcome may be most evident when we consider those major destabilizers in the nuclear world that come under the classification of &amp;#34;accidents.&amp;#34; …identified within nuclearist discourse itself, as the case of &amp;#34;accident&amp;#34; shows. This gives the era a hallucinatory quality, when the master-in-control reveals his own foibles. And, as Klein and Warner conclude, &amp;#34;Hallucinatory effects and effects of coincidence acquire, in this space, uncanny power to become the bases for fateful decisions.&amp;#34;45

The aff’s expansion of space exploration and development with the symbolic economy of deterrence ensures genocide and destruction
Zupancic ‘00, (Alenka, Ethics of the Real: Kant and Lacan, March, p. 96-7)
“Another problem still remains, ….rather, an imperative which invites us to recognize as our own the `infinite&amp;#39; which can occur as something that is `essentially a by-product&amp;#39; of our actions.

Thus the Alternative: Vote negative to think beyond the logic of deterrence

The aff’s technical management of deterrence inevitably leads to paradox – only the alt’s refusal to engage the world within the framework of deterrence can ensure a sustainable strategy for achieving peace and security
Williams 92 (Michael C, Professor in the Graduate School of Public and International Affairs at the University of Ottawa, “Rethinking the Logic of Deterrence” p. 87-89 JSTOR) RF
Thinking about strategy in general, and about d…the thinking space necessary to confront more adequately these challenges.

Their implicit acceptance of deterrence ideology fosters complacency through fear leaving the public unable to challenge government secrecy
Kurasawa ‘4, (Fuyuki, Assistant Prof. of Sociology @ York University, Cautionary Tales, Constellations Vol. 11, No. 4, Blackwell Synergy)
Independently of this contractualist justification, global civil society actors are putting forth a number of arguments countering temporal myopia on rational grounds. They make the case that no generation, and no part of the world, is immune from catastrophe. Complacency and parochialism are deeply flawed in that even if we earn a temporary reprieve, our children and grandchildren will likely not be so fortunate unless steps are taken today. Similarly, though it might be possible to minimize or contain the risks and harms of actions to faraway places over the short-term, parrying the eventual blowback or spillover effect is improbable….. The answer, I think, lies in cultivating the public capacity for critical judgment and deliberation, so that participants in global civil society subject all claims about potential catastrophes to examination, evaluation, and contestation. Two normative concepts are particularly well suited to grounding these tasks: the precautionary principle and global justice. 

Only our alternative opens up space for a preventative foresight which can cope with emerging global challenges – their single-issue focus leaves expertism in place 
Kurasawa ‘4, (Fuyuki, Assistant Prof. of Sociology @ York University, Cautionary Tales, Constellations Vol. 11, No. 4, Blackwell Synergy) 
In the first instance, preventive foresight is an intersubjective or dialogical process of address, recognition, and response between two parties in global civil society: the ‘warners,’ who anticipate and send out word of possible perils, and the audiences being warned, those who heed their interlocutors’ messages by demanding that governments and/or international organizations take measures to steer away from disaster. Secondly, the work of farsightedness derives its effectiveness and legitimacy ….
