At an altitude of 22,240 miles above Earth, a great platform orbits, using vast, mirrored wings to collect a continuous torrent of sunlight always available in space. ….. Capturing solar power from space-based platforms can solve this crisis. This is energy that is essentially carbon-free, endless and can be dispatched to best meet the dynamically changing requirements of populations separated by thousands of miles.

A year ago, I wrote to Gordon Brown asking him to place a moratorium on new coal-fired power plants in Britain. ….When I testified against the proposed Kingsnorth power plant, I estimated that in its lifetime it would be responsible for the extermination of about 400 species - its proportionate contribution to the number that would be committed to extinction if carbon dioxide rose another 100 ppm.

The best estimates for global warming to the end of the century range from 2.5-4.~C above pre-industrial levels, depending on the scenario. ….What is certain is that there is no precedent in human experience for such rapid change or such climatic conditions, and even in the best case adaptation to these extremes would mean profound social, cultural and political changes.

Understanding the existing institutional framework is therefore essential both in design and implementation of climate change policies. ….. Shifting from gasoline-fueled internal-combustion engines to electrically powered vehicles will have a different effect if the electricity is produced through coal rather than renewable power sources.

Another important and clear terrestrial benefit that would result from the development and deployment of space solar power is that of substantial numbers of new…. annual employment on the order of 5,000,000 individuals might be realized eventually.
It’s not just high-tech jobs – limiting unemployment creates a social infrastructure that is key to lifting the poorest of the poor

Low unemployment rates also yield tremendous social benefits by providing a rung on the ladder of economic opportunity to those previously excluded from the labor force. ….. greater productivity, enhanced opportunities for the most disadvantaged and sound public finances.
This solves economic nationalism and protectionism

This conventional wisdom is valid most, but not all of the time. …. The longer this reality is denied, the greater will be the cost to society of restoring economic stability.
The impact is great power conflict and nuclear terrorism

Continuing calls for curbs on the flow of finance and trade will inspire the United States and other nations to spew forth protectionist legislation like the notorious Smoot-Hawley bill. ….. Terrorists employing biological or nuclear weapons will vie with conventional forces using jets, cruise missiles, and bunker-busting bombs to cause widespread destruction. Many will interpret stepped-up conflicts between Muslims and Western societies as the beginnings of a new world war.

DoD as anchor tenant is the only way to get the private sector on board

FINDING: The SBSP Study Group found that industry has stated that the #1 driver and requirement for generating industry interest and investment in developing the initial operational SBSP systems is acquiring an anchor tenant customer, or customers….. of a commercially‐delivered service, such as the NextView acquisition approach pioneered by the National GeoSpatial‐imaging Agency. 

Aff is a pre-requisite to their private sector spillover—it’s the only way to make it cost-competitive

Military Interest….Energy companies working with the DoD could also begin to supply SBSP to the public sector as the costs of SBSP lower over time.

In other words, if space-based solar power existed today it would be saving the lives of American men and women in Iraq. ….. The availability of a dependable anchor tenant customer, who is willing to pay $1 or more per kilowatt hour for large amounts of power, is a major step forward
