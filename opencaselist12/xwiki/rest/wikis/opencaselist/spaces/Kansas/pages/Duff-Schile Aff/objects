===Plan===

====The United States Army Corps of Engineers should procure mobile solar power systems from companies who comply with the Solar Industry Environment and Social Responsibility Commitment for its training exercises and activities in response to emergencies in the United States.====

===Contention 1: Solvency===

====Solar inevitable====
**Wilcher 12**
Marvin Wilcher¶ Contributing Columnist for Louisiana Weekly¶ Solar power: African Americans may miss the boat, again%21¶ 27th August 2012 · ¶ http://www.louisianaweekly.com/solar-power-african-americans-may-miss-the-boat-again/-http://www.louisianaweekly.com/solar-power-african-americans-may-miss-the-boat-again/
To understand just how fast this industry is growing, in 2009 solar technologies generated 
AND
that provides much of the power that propels airplanes on cross country flights.¶ 

====Solar key to effective disaster response====
**Young ~’03**
William Young. Jr. Research Engineer. University of Central Florida PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS: TRAINING DISASTER ORGANIZATIONS¶ On The Use Of PV http://www.fsec.ucf.edu/en/publications/pdf/fsec-pf-371-03.pdf
Experience has shown that photovotaics can be used effectively to supply electrical power during emergencies
AND
and experience they need to accept PV in their operations under these circumstances?

====Solar emergency generators are the key to effective stable energy supplies in an emergency====
**Spisak ~’11**
John Spisak Spisak has extensive experience in the national environmental policy arena having co-chaired a national organization for the reform of the Superfund Law working closely with both houses of Congress having been invited to testify numerous times before various Senate and House Committeesis, the President and CEO of SolaRover, , a science graduate of Purdue University has broad international business experience in the natural resources, new technologies and environmental industries.¶ http://www.theicosamagazine.com/solarover
Mobile Solar in Disaster Zones¶ The second part of the value equation is found 
AND
be prolonged. Mobile solar power can provide the security and the solutions.

====Only solar solves – no supply routes for diesel====
**DOE 99**
Counting on Solar Power for¶ Disaster Relief¶ http://www1.eere.energy.gov/femp/pdfs/26042.pdf
When disaster strikes, electric power¶ is usually the first critically¶ important service 
AND
weather is extremely cloudy or stormy¶ for more than a few days.

====The Army Corps of Engineers has unique capabilities to anticipate and respond quickly to any disaster====
**Corps Results 09**
&amp;#34;Emergency Management&amp;#34; Produced by the U.S. Army Engineer Institute for Water Resources inpartnership with the Headquarters Emergency
Management Branch, http://www.corpsresults.us/docs/VTNEmerMgmtBro_loresprd.pdf, AD 10/25/12
The Corps is committed to ensuring that its emergency¶ management teams are well prepared
AND
. These vehicles contain¶ cuttingedge¶ communications systems and computer¶ systems.\\

===Contention 2: Disasters===

====The effects of natural disasters are not natural, but rather determined by a social calculus—Katrina has exposed the discrimination of violence to underprivileged persons====
**Smith 6 **- Professor of Anthropology and Geography at the CUNY Graduate Center
Neil, 6/11/06, &amp;#34;There~’s No Such Thing as a Natural Disaster&amp;#34; http://www.masteramericanstudies.unito.it/courses/dawson_course/Smith,%20Natural%20Disaster.pdf
It is generally accepted among environmental geographers that there is no such thing as a 
AND
more than anything dependent on one~’s race, ¶ ethnicity and social class.

====Katrina highlighted the inherent racism in policymaking====
**Stivers 7 **– Professor and Distinguished Scholar of Public Administration in the Maxine Goodman Levin College of Urban Affairs at Cleveland State University
Camilla, 12/7/07, &amp;#34;&amp;#34;So Poor and So Black&amp;#34;: Hurricane Katrina, Public Administration, and the Issue of Race&amp;#34; Public Administration Review Volume 67, Issue Supplement s1, pages 48–56
It is impossible to explain the past fully. The meaning of an event exceeds 
AND
obligation, and one that cannot be solved by diversity or preparedness training.

====And, the logic of racism is a structural necessity for war====
Mendieta ~’2 
Eduardo, SUNY @ Stony Brook, Meeting of the Foucault Circle from To make live and to let die – Foucault on Racism, April 25
This is where racism intervenes, not from without, exogenously, but from within
AND
of the living, then these threat and foes are biological in nature.

====And, racism is also structurally violent and intrinsically unjust====
**Memmi 2k** 
Albert, Professor Emeritus of Sociology @ Unv. Of Paris; RACISM, translated by Steve Martinot, pp.163
The struggle against racism will be long, difficult, without intermission, without remission
AND
. True, it is a wager, but the stakes are irresistible.

====This is a question of violence that occurs against normal people every day- deprioritize questions of uniqueness and timeframe and investigate the structures most likely to produce injustice====
**Scheper-Hughes and Bourgois ~’4 **
(Prof of Anthropology @ Cal-Berkely; Prof of Anthropology @ UPenn) (Nancy and Philippe, Introduction: Making Sense of Violence, in Violence in War and Peace, pg. 19-22) 
This large and at first sight &amp;#34;messy&amp;#34; Part VII is central to this 
AND
as a chronic &amp;#34;state of emergency&amp;#34; (Taussig, Chapter 31).  

====You should frame your decision in terms of pedagogical impact- using the debate space to criticize violent structures expands the boundaries of our consciousness and creates research practices that are more sensitive to slow, everyday violence- that~’s a pre-requisite to effective use of science and empiricism====
**Nixon ~’11**
(Rob, Rachel Carson Professor of English, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Slow Violence and the Environmentalism of the Poor, pgs. 14-16)
How do we bring home-and bring emotionally to life-threats that take 
AND
often whose very existence-is of indifferent interest to the corporate media. 

====Facilitating access to life saving technologies is critical to embracing an ethic of care====
**Lawson 8**
Victoria Lawson a¶ a Department of Geography, University of Washington¶ Victoria Lawson (2007): Geographies of Care and Responsibility, Annals of the Association of American¶ Geographers, 97:1, 1-11
¶ Within geospatial analysis, care ethics poses questions¶ about the social and spatial 
AND
especially in poor areas where people are less able to help¶ themselves.¶ 

**====The ethic of care of the 1AC spills over to larger social inequalities and the orientation of disaster relief as the starting point for that ethic allows us to establish a model for future ethical acts====**
**Carse and Nelson, 96**
Alisa L. Carse, Ph.D., is Assistant Professor of Philosophy and a Senior Research Fellow at the Kennedy Institute of Ethics, Georgetown University and Hilda Lindemann Nelson, M.A., is Director of the Center for Applied and Professional Ethics at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. Kennedy Institute of Ethics Journal 6.1 (1996) 19-35
Many critics argue that care, which is naturally extended to intimates and others with 
AND
it to dyadic relationships or to proximate spheres of social relationship and interaction. 

====Our plan is an academic intervention- it represents a historic and political act that links the history of racial violence in the United States to social disorder during disasters. Focusing on these methodological questions is the only relevant addition that debaters can make to the academic community.====
**Apple and Beane ~’7**
Michael W. Apple and James A. Beane, Democratic Schools, January 30, 2007, Chapter One: The Case for Democratic Schools
We have chosen to include in this book four examples of democracy brought to life 
AND
are either futile or subversive. They have no legitimate reason for existence.

====This examination in the context of disasters provides the power to change social life on a political and personal scale====
**Giroux 6 **- Global TV Network Chair in English and Cultural Studies at McMaster University
Henry, 2006, &amp;#34;Reading Hurricane Katrina: Race, Class, and the Biopolitics of Disposability&amp;#34; College Literature 33.3
Katrina reveals that we are living in dark times. The shadow of authoritarianism remains 
AND
lifeblood of democracy, becomes cold and indifferent in the face of death.

====Failure to act represents incompetence and an ethical failure of the government====
**Adams and Balfour 7 **– *PhD, Professor @ Harry S. Truman School of Public Affairs **PhD, Professor @ Grand Valley State University
Guy and Danny, May 2007, &amp;#34;Leadership, Administrative Evil and the Ethics of Incompetence: Lessons from Katrina and Iraq&amp;#34; http://www.ipa.udel.edu/3tad/papers/workshop6/Adams%26Balfour.pdf
Incompetence refers to the inability to properly and effectively perform a given function ¶ (
AND
public service response to ¶ Hurricane Katrina, to which we now turn.

====Challenging these inequalities in the context of energy is key====
**Miller et al 11**

This article analyses the actions of electric companies serving the Houston, Texas area2 as 
AND
Spill disaster and highlight that neoliberalism makes us all more susceptible to disasters.

Lands Available For Leasing¶ Public lands are available for oil and gas leasing only 
AND
or remove any minerals other than oil and gas from the leased land.  

**These &amp;#34;Public Land&amp;#34; limits on production are time, place, and manner restrictions on production.  While they are sometimes referred to as regulations they are restrictions**

There are approximately 39,000,000 acres of federal mineral estate¶ in 
AND
them, and several policy changes that could accomplish this¶ are suggested.

====The Bureau of Land Management has wrongly extended these public land restrictions to indian lands—indian lands are not public lands and policy that asserts otherwise prevents indian self-determination and sovereignty====

Indian Land Recovery in the United States?¶ ¶ Leaving aside questions concerning the validity of various treaties, the beginning point for any indigenist endeavor in the United States centers, logically enough, in efforts to restore direct Indian control over the huge portion of the continental United States that was plainly never ceded by native nations.
