===Framework ===&#xD;
&#xD;
====We are civil society actors debating about dystopian imagery towards the end of transforming domestic energy policy and avoiding preventable catastrophic consequences produced by irresponsible actions.====&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
====This framework transforms the debate community into a weak public capable of influencing public policy through preventative foresight- we are the concerned citizenry that shape public discussion of warming and push for more cooperative IR approaches====&#xD;
**Kurasawa ~’4**, (Fuyuki, Assistant Prof. of Sociology @ York University, Cautionary Tales, Constellations Vol. 11, No. 4, Blackwell Synergy)&#xD;
In the twenty-first century, the lines of political cleavage are being drawn &#xD;
AND&#xD;
a position to ~’move up~’ and become  institutionalized via strong publics.7   &#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
====And, this culture of foresight is crucial if we are to avert the impact of climate change- we must be willing to transform debate in order to galvanize cooperation on long-term issues. Anything else lets nationalism and fundamentalism fill the void.====&#xD;
**Kurasawa ~’4,** (Fuyuki, Assistant Prof. of Sociology @ York University, Cautionary Tales, Constellations Vol. 11, No. 4, Blackwell Synergy)&#xD;
In addition, farsightedness has become a priority in world affairs due to the  appearance &#xD;
AND&#xD;
case of the spiraling African and Asian AIDS pandemics, appear  particularly glaring.  &#xD;
 &#xD;
&#xD;
====And, within this framework we must orient ourselves towards concern for future generations- the alternative is a regression into concern for only immediate problems, making warming irreversible and locking down cooperative approaches to international relations. ====&#xD;
**Kurasawa ~’4,** (Fuyuki, Assistant Prof. of Sociology @ York University, Cautionary Tales, Constellations Vol. 11, No. 4, Blackwell Synergy)&#xD;
&#xD;
In the previous section, I described how the capacity to produce, disseminate, &#xD;
AND&#xD;
the basis of which civic associations can enact the work of preventive foresight.   &#xD;

The trajectory of public understanding frustrates many climate scientists and educators who see climate risks &#xD;
AND&#xD;
region to weather even the most pessimistic climate projections if action begins soon.&#xD;

caring about the future of their communities, causes this distrust to dissipate.

====Uniquely targeted at minority communities====
**Mills 1** – Professor of Philosophy at the University of Illinois, Chicago
Charles, &amp;#34;Faces of Environmental Racism: Confronting Issues of Global Justice (2nd ed.,), p. 88-89
In this revised conceptual framework, then, it becomes unsurprising that the United Church 
AND
—throwaways on a throwaway population, dumping on the white body~’s dumpsite.

====The urban poor are hit the hardest by rising energy costs—brightfield development is key to limit the socially regressive nature of high electricity bills.====
**Ribeiro 7** – JD, managed the development of the Brockton Brightfield
Lori, &amp;#34;Waste to watts: A &amp;#34;brightfield&amp;#34; installation has the potential to bring renewed life to a brownfield site,&amp;#34; Refocus, Science Direct
Many urban areas grapple with the challenge of redeveloping brownfields in ways that avoid the 
AND
use of solar electricity can serve as a hedge against increasing electricity costs.  

====The impact of high electricity prices hits the urban poor the hardest====
**Baker 8** – Lead Economist @ the Urban Development Unit
Judy, http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTURBANDEVELOPMENT/Resources/336387-1226422021646/directions_2.pdf?resourceurlname=directions_2.pdf
The impacts on the urban poor are felt through a number of channels. With regard to food prices, the high costs¶ directly hit the household consumption budgets of the poor¶ as they are almost all net consumers. Higher energy prices¶ result in higher production costs for a range of goods and¶ services which use fuel such as manufactured goods, food,¶ and transportation services though this impact is difficult¶ to quantify.¶ 2¶ The high costs also directly hit the urban poor¶ through the extra cost of purchasing fuel. The proportion of total household consumption that the poor spend on fuel is¶ approximately 10% overall, and tends to be higher in urban¶ areas. Higher prices may also cause households to move¶ down the ladder of fuels which can have negative consequences such as indoor air pollution with increased use of¶ biomass, and deforestation through collection of food (e.g.¶ in peri-urban areas).

====This access to electricity should not be denied====
**Tully 6** – former BP Postdoctoral Fellow of the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) Centre for the Analysis of Risk and Regulation and of the Law Department of the London School of Economics and Political Science
Stephen, &amp;#34;The Human Right to Access Electricity,&amp;#34; The Electricity Journal vol 19 issue 3, April 2006, pg 30-39
Characterizing electricity as an essential civic service implies that governments are expected to provide access 
AND
human needs enjoys priority above directly productive but competing agricultural or industrial applications.


===Warming===

====Solar power solves warming====
**Solar Information No Date**
&amp;#34;Solar Power and Climate Change&amp;#34; ~~http://solar.calfinder.com/blog/solar-information/solar-power-and-climate-change/~~ 
Climate change is of the utmost importance 
AND
change prevention and the impending energy overhaul.


====Warming is real and human induced – consensus is on our side – numerous studies prove====
**Rahmstorf 8 – Professor of Physics of the Oceans**
Richard, of Physics of the Oceans at Potsdam University, Global Warming: Looking Beyond Kyoto, Edited by Ernesto Zedillo, &amp;#34;Anthropogenic Climate Change?,&amp;#34; pg. 42-4
It is time to turn to statement B: human activities are altering the climate
AND
that anthropogenic global warming is a reality with which we need to deal.


====Only action now solves future catastrophe====
**Antholis and Talbott 10 – Director and President @ Brookings**
William Antholis, managing director of the Brookings Institution and a senior fellow in Governance Studies, former director of studies at the German Marshall Fund of the United States, and Strobe Talbott, president of the Brookings Institution, deputy Sec. of State under Clinton, &amp;#34;The Global Warming Tipping Point,&amp;#34; The Globalist, http://www.theglobalist.com/storyid.aspx?StoryId=8523
Moreover, we need to start reductions now in order 
AND 
of energy that do not burn fossil fuels and therefore do not pump CO2 into the atmosphere.


====Not inevitable – cuts solve====
**Somerville 11 – Professor of Oceanography @ UCSD**
Richard Somerville, Distinguished Professor Emeritus and Research Professor at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego, Coordinating Lead Author in Working Group I for the 2007 Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 3-8-2011, &amp;#34;CLIMATE SCIENCE AND EPA~’S GREENHOUSE GAS REGULATIONS,&amp;#34; CQ Congressional Testimony, Lexis
Thus, atmospheric CO2 concentrations 
AND
will be required to keep climate change within that limit.


====Warming is an existential threat====
**Mazo 10 – PhD in Paleoclimatology from UCLA**
Jeffrey Mazo, Managing Editor, Survival and Research Fellow for Environmental Security and Science Policy at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, 3-2010, &amp;#34;Climate Conflict: How global warming threatens security and what to do about it,&amp;#34; pg. 122
The best estimates for global warming to the end of the century range from 2.5-4.~~C above 
AND 
extremes would mean profound social, cultural and political changes.


====Death is the ultimate evil – it obliterates metaphysics and ontology, even if suffering is good death must be prevented====
**Paterson 3** - Department of Philosophy, Providence College, Rhode Island 
Craig, &amp;#34;A Life Not Worth Living?&amp;#34;, Studies in Christian Ethics, SAGE
Contrary to those accounts, I would argue that it is death per se that is really the objective 
AND 
not seek to irrationally destroy the person, the very source and condition of all human possibility.



====Catastrophic climate change should be measured as the highest priority – do not discount the unpredictable impact it will have on future generations.  This is distinctly different from impacts that do not threaten human survival====
Scorse 8 – Professor of International Studies
Jason, Assistant Professor @ Monterey Institute of International Studies @ Middlebury College, What Environmentalists Need to Know About Economics, Online Book
Even though the science now confirms that human activity is contributing 
AND 
we should revert back to the basic arguments for choosing the proper discount rate.


====Warming crushes biodiversity – causes extinction====
**Hansen et al 12**

Although extreme heat waves and record floods 
AND 
a scenario is needed if we are to preserve life as we know it.

====Carbon dioxide acidifies the oceans====
**Ward 2010**
 (Peter, PhD, professor of Biology and Earth and Space Sciences at the University of Washington, paleontologist and NASA astrobiologist, Fellow at the California Academy of Sciences, The Flooded Earth: Our Future in a World Without Ice Caps, June 29, 2010,)
The rate at which carbon dioxide is increasing into the atmosphere is 
AND 
rate is about one-hundredth of the changes we are witnessing now.

====Extinction—emission reductions are critical to preventing this====
**Romm 2009**

Global warming is &amp;#34;capable of wrecking the marine ecosystem and depriving future generations of 
AND
that life &amp;#34;&amp;#34; the time to start slashing carbon dioxide emissions is now.

Climate change will increase worldwide deaths from malnutrition and heat 
AND 
Katrina continue to create health problems for its population, for example the so-called &amp;#34;Katrina cough&amp;#34;.

The prior interglacial period, the Eemian, was at most ~~1°C 
AND 
from highly-populated low-lying areas, thus likely causing major international conflicts.


====Warming is the largest impact – its certainty requires that we transition away from current trends in policy making – we must orient our ethical questions towards the effects of a transforming climate on the most vulnerable nations in the world – this ethic assures we prevent the annihilation of the most vulnerable**====
**Gordon 7**
Ruth Gordon, Professor of Law at Villinova University, &amp;#34;The Climate of Environmental Justice: Taking Stock: Climate Change and the Poorest Nations: Further Reflections on Global Inequality&amp;#34;. Colorado Law Review, Lexis
There is no longer any question that the earth~’s climate is warming. We can, and 
AND 
vulnerable and technologically lacking low-income nations.



====Global warming disproportionately effects the worlds most vulnerable populations – continued emissions affect all functions critical to a healthy and sustainable life====
**Goldman 11 – MD, Representative for the American Public Health Association**
Lynn Goldman, MD, Representative for the American Public Health Association, 2-9-2011, &amp;#34;ENERGY AND TAX PREVENTION ACT OF 2011,&amp;#34; CQ Congressional Testimony, Lexis
Climate change is a public health issue and is one of the greatest threats to 
AND
among our most vulnerable populations, children, the elderly and the poor.


====No ethical principle justifies the inequality of climate change – mitigation is the utmost ethical imperative because it is the only thing that address structural injustice ====

The emerging field of &amp;#34;climate justice&amp;#34; is concerned with the intersection of race, poverty, and climate change. It takes, as a basic premise, that the disadvantaged in the ~~*193~~ United 
AND 
favor of distribution bending steeply in favor of the poor.


====We must take into account those that are not immediately visible – focusing on local and global politics is necessary to develop ethical climate politics====
-this is a defense of international focus
-this card says that lack of empathy is the most likely cause of continued emissions and willful ignorance of the impacts of our consumption decisions on others
**Krznaric 10 **– PhD in Sociology from Oxford
Roman, PhD in Sociology from Oxford, founding faculty member of The School of Life in London, where he teaches courses on Work and Politics, and is the resident expert on Empathy, Future Ethics, pg. 163-166
Climate change is as much a problem across space as it is one through time
AND
drought-struck farmers in Kenya can hear us chuckling in the sun.

====Empathy framing is a pre-requisite to justice and peace – ends the desire for exploitation and violence====

What~’s ahead for US-India relations now that President Obama has won reelection? 
AND
on the horizon, the future looks bright for US-India relations.

====PC on climate ====
**Daily Camera 2/15**
Obama~’s new vision: Doable?, 2/15/13, Lexis
The president also renewed his call to reduce carbon emissions, suggesting that he may spend some political capital on that vital issue. He endorsed sensible steps to deter gun violence, including new protections against sham sales that arm criminals. And he reconfirmed his commitment to ending the U.S. war in Afghanistan next year.

====Gun control costs PC – even if only background checks====
**Metzler 2/15**

TVA~’s power program is entirely self-financed and does not receive any federal appropriations. TVA, like the rest of the ¶ electric utility industry, is challenged to meet growing customer demands with cleaner, low-cost energy resources. This will ¶ require substantial capital investments during the next decade. TVA raises capital for asset investments through power ¶ revenues, public bonds up to a limit set by Congress, and alternative financings, including lease financings.

President Obama can – and will – take steps on immigration reform in the event Congress doesn~’t reach a comprehensive deal this year, according to several House Democratic leaders. While the Democrats are hoping Congress will preclude any executive action by enacting reforms legislatively, they say the administration has the tools to move unilaterally if the bipartisan talks on Capitol Hill break down. Furthermore, they say, Obama stands poised to use them.

China, India~’s hated foe, could react if India used her nuclear weapons, triggering a nuclear holocaust on the subcontinent.

====Neoliberalism makes war and conflict less likely.====
**Obhof ~’3 – J.D. from Yale Law School**
Larry J. Obhof, J.D., Yale Law School, 2003; B.A., Ohio University, 2000. &amp;#34;WHY GLOBALIZATION? A LOOK AT GLOBAL CAPITALISM AND ITS EFFECTS&amp;#34;. University of Florida Journal of Law %26 Public Policy. Fall 2003. Lexis. 

====Perhaps the strongest argument in favor of global capitalism is based on another &amp;#34;externality&amp;#34;: conflict prevention. Many have speculated that international investment may inhibit conflict by promoting economic growth and interdependence. n145 Conflict becomes relatively less attractive as a country reaches higher levels of economic development. As one  ~~*117~~  scholar put it, &amp;#34;~~F~~ree trade makes nations too busy and too rich to fight.&amp;#34; n146 Increasing economic interdependence compounds this effect. Indeed, the more a country~’s economy depends on foreign trade or investment, the more self-damaging it is to engage in aggression. n147 This idea is certainly not new. As Montesquieu penned in 1752: &amp;#34;Peace is the natural effect of trade. Two nations who traffic with each other become reciprocally dependent . . . and thus their union is founded on their mutual necessities.&amp;#34; n148 The wisdom of Montesquieu~’s statement has become even more apparent in recent years. As the now-famous &amp;#34;Golden Arches Theory of Conflict Prevention&amp;#34; by Thomas Friedman makes clear, there is a point at which the desire of a country for trade and investment restricts the capacity for war-making by its leadership. n149 Economic integration places strong constraints on countries &amp;#34;plugged into the system&amp;#34;: investors may withdraw billions of dollars, not merely retarding economic growth, but in some cases dispatching it altogether. Any chance of a conflict is inhibited by the direct investments that natives have in foreign countries, and the investments that foreigners have in the home country. n150 Perhaps the simplicity of this argument makes it easy to dismiss. Its importance is not lost, however, on world leaders. In 1996, as the first fully democratic elections of Taiwan were approaching, columnist Thomas Friedman travelled Beijing to observe the growing tensions between China and Taiwan. China was threatening to invade if Taiwan sought total independence from the mainland. When Friedman interviewed a senior economist from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, he asked if China could in fact afford to attack Taiwan. The economist answered, &amp;#34;No - it would stop investment in China, stop growth, stop our last chance to catch up with the rest of the world.&amp;#34; n151 With 20% of its total annual investment  ~~*118~~  coming from foreign sources, and exports to America making up 40% of the total exports of China, the Chinese economy simply could not withstand the shock that a war would cause. The economist was admitting &amp;#34;that China could not attack Taiwan without devastating its own economy.&amp;#34; n152 The rest, as they say, is history. Tensions continue, but the Chinese government, eager for growth and aware of the consequences of its actions, remains in check.====

====Neoliberalism improves human welfare.====

John Gerring, Boston University Department of Political Science and Strom C. Thacker, Boston University Department of International Relations. &amp;#34;Do Neoliberal Economic Policies Kill or Save Lives?&amp;#34;. Bussiness and Politics Volume 10, Issue 3 2008. http://people.bu.edu/jgerring/documents/IMRpolicy.pdf

====While far from exhaustive, the robustness tests undertaken in this study suggest that the main findings are not likely to be an artifact of arbitrary model specifications or estimation techniques. On balance, there appears to be a strong relationship between neoliberal economic policies and improved human welfare, as measured by infant mortality rates. It is important to note that this relationship persists even while controlling for level of economic development. This is an interesting finding, since we tend to think of neoliberal economic policies operating upon human development primarily in an indirect manner. According to proponents, market-friendly policies should enhance growth, which should, in turn, improve human wellbeing. The fact that, independent of their effect of economic development, these neoliberal economic policies are still significantly associated with improved human welfare suggests that an even stronger overall causal relationship may be at work. If, that is, neoliberal policies have a tendency to promote long-term growth, then we may presume that their net effect on IMR is even stronger than measured by coefficients on key &amp;#34;neoliberal&amp;#34; variables in Tables 1 and 2, given that economic development is, itself, a major factor in the reduction of infant mortality. We do not attempt to model the precise nature of this indirect causal relationship because this would require strong assumptions about neoliberalism~’s causal effect on growth performance, a contentions topic that lies beyond the scope of this study.====

many is the Obama agenda on the wrong side of public opinion altogether?

President Obama can – and will – take steps on immigration reform in the event Congress doesn~’t reach a comprehensive deal this year, according to several House Democratic leaders. While the Democrats are hoping Congress will preclude any executive action by enacting reforms legislatively, they say the administration has the tools to move unilaterally if the bipartisan talks on Capitol Hill break down. Furthermore, they say, Obama stands poised to use them.

===Plan ===

====The Tennessee Valley Authority should increase procurement contracts for mixed oxide fuel for its electricity generation in the United States.====


===Nuclear Cooperation===

====Advantage one – nuclear cooperation====

====The groundwork exists for US-Russian plutonium cooperation – however, electricity produced from MOX is key to fulfill the PMDA====
**DTRIP ~’12 **
Defense Treaty Inspection Readiness Program, &amp;#34;Plutonium Management and Disposition Agreement&amp;#34;, 2012, http://dtirp.dtra.mil/tic/synopses/pmda.aspx
The Plutonium Management and Disposition Agreement (PMDA), ~~long title: Agreement Between 
AND
finished, including a new electrical substation which was completed in September 2010.

====MOX is key – any alternative explicitly violates the terms of the treaty====
**Wolfe ~’12 **
Clinton R., PhD in Chemistry, executive director of Citizens for Nuclear Technology Awareness in Aiken, S.C. He formerly chaired the Technical Advisory Panel to the U.S. Department of Energy~’s Plutonium Focus Area, &amp;#34;Guest Column&amp;#34; The Augustana Chronicles, Augustana GA, 11/18/12   www.c-n-t-a.com/letters.htm~~%23GN1208
After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Clinton administration made treaty obligations with 
AND
that mankind can make decisions of this importance and actually pull them off.

====Any waste alternative devastates all nuclear cooperation – violates reciprocity and forces the treaty open for future changes====
**Wolfe ~’11**
Clinton R., PhD in Chemistry, executive director of Citizens for Nuclear Technology Awareness in Aiken, S.C. He formerly chaired the Technical Advisory Panel to the U.S. Department of Energy~’s Plutonium Focus Area, &amp;#34; &amp;#34;July 6, 2011¶ Letter/column in¶ The Augusta Chronicle - Augusta GA¶ Examine big picture of MOX mission &amp;#34; www.c-n-t-a.com/letters.htm~~%23GN1208
I would like to first consider his reference to cost vs. the alternative. 
AND
name of tight budgets would be penny-wise and pound-foolish.

====MOX facility key – programs must proceed in parallel to solve the agreement====
**Wolfe 2/17**

He formerly chaired the Technical Advisory Panel to the U.S. Department of Energy~’s Plutonium Focus Area, &amp;#34;Too much is at stake to throw MOX nuclear project into jeopardy,&amp;#34; 2/17/13 m.chronicle.augusta.com/opinion/opinion-columns/2013-02-17/too-much-stake-throw-mox-nuclear-project-jeopardy
In any event, it is reckless and foolish to talk about terminating the program 
AND
It~’s going to take decades – and continued investments – to dismantle them.&amp;#34;

====MOX infrastructure is reverse causal – the plan creates broader nuclear cooperation====
**Sokova ~’10 **
Elena, research associate at the Monterey Institute of International Studies &amp;#34;Plutonium Disposition&amp;#34;, NTI, 9-16-2010, http://www.nti.org/analysis/articles/plutonium-disposition-14/
To ensure the plutonium subject to disposition is irreversibly removed from use in nuclear weapons
AND
the existence of an operational infrastructure for MOX fuel fabrication makes this possible.

====Plutonium cooperation is vital – all other agreements are focused on arms reductions but don~’t address weapons-grade material ====
**Clinton and Lavrov ~’10 **

SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, good afternoon, and let me state the obvious. 
AND
and I join the Secretary in thanking the teams which negotiated this agreement.

To advance its position, Russia has undertaken a three-year mission to map 
AND
, Russia backtracked and began to seek foreign investors for Arctic gas development.

====Traditional defense doesn~’t apply to an Arctic security dilemma====

Robert, &amp;#34;Zarate on U.S. and Russian Plutonium Management,&amp;#34; Non-Proliferation Education Policy Center, http://www.npolicy.org/article.php?aid=253%26rid=1
U.S. and Russian stockpiles only account for roughly half of the estimated

Felix, &amp;#34;Is Pakistan~’s Paranoia Pushing it Into a Nuclear War with India?,&amp;#34; http://www.unknowncountry.com/insight/pakistans-paranoia-pushing-it-nuclear-war-india
The high command has concluded that the only equalizer for the weaker of the competitors 
AND
survival of South Asia and far beyond will be depending on that decision.

====Other security systems are insufficient====
**Bunn ~’12** – Matthew, Professor of Public Policy @ Harvard, AND **Eben Harrell, Research Associate at the Project on Managing the Atom in the Belfer Center 
&amp;#34;Consolidation: Thwarting Nuclear Theft,&amp;#34; http://www.nuclearsummit.org/files/Consolidation_Thwarting_Nuclear_Theft.pdf
Sites in areas where the adversary threat is especially high. While terrorist groups such 
AND
have higher priority in consolidation ¶ eff orts than stocks in other countries.

====This is the highest magnitude====
**Case 11** – MBA @ Sasin Institute

The stakes couldn~’t be much higher. Pakistan is volatile cocktail of instability, extremism 
AND
threats, and the Obama administration lacks options to do much about it.

In 1914, a terrorist assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo - unleashing geopolitical forces 
AND
for broader geopolitical crises may be the greatest threat we face from terrorism. 

====Nuclear winter====
**Fai 1 **- Kashmiri American Council
Ghulam Nabi, The Washington Times, &amp;#34;The most dangerous place&amp;#34;, July 8, Lexis
The foreign policy of the United States in South Asia should move from the lackadaisical 
AND
winter threatening the entire globe. The United States would enjoy no sanctuary.


====Major powers get drawn in====
**Caldicott 2** - Founder of Physicians for Social Responsibility and Nominee for the Nobel Peace Prize
Helen, &amp;#34;The New Nuclear Danger: George W. Bush~’s Military-Industrial Complex&amp;#34;, p. xiii
The use of Pakistani nuclear weapons could trigger a chain reaction. Nuclear-armed India, an ancient enemy could respond in kind. China, India~’s hated foe, could react if India used her nuclear weapons, triggering a nuclear holocaust on the subcontinent. If any of either Russia or America~’s 2,250 strategic weapons on hair-trigger alert were launched either accidentally or purposefully in response, nuclear winter would ensue, meaning the end of most life on earth.

**Bunn ~’07 **
Matthew Bunn is a senior research associate in the Managing the Atom project at Harvard 
AND

A. The government of the United States is not a single official entity. Nor is it when it is referred to as the federal government or the US government or the US federal government. It~’s just a government, which, like those in all countries, has some official bodies that act and operate in the name of government: the Congress, the Senate, the Department of State, etc.
