===Warming ===&#xD;
&#xD;
====Warming is real and human induced – consensus is on our side – numerous studies prove====&#xD;
**Rahmstorf 8 – Professor of Physics of the Oceans**&#xD;
Richard, of Physics of the Oceans at Potsdam University, Global Warming: Looking Beyond Kyoto, Edited by Ernesto Zedillo, &amp;#34;Anthropogenic Climate Change?,&amp;#34; pg. 42-4&#xD;
It is time to turn to statement B: human activities are altering the climate&#xD;
AND&#xD;
that anthropogenic global warming is a reality with which we need to deal.&#xD;
&#xD;
====Only action now solves future catastrophe====&#xD;
**Antholis and Talbott 10 – Director and President @ Brookings**&#xD;
William Antholis, managing director of the Brookings Institution and a senior fellow in Governance Studies, former director of studies at the German Marshall Fund of the United States, and Strobe Talbott, president of the Brookings Institution, deputy Sec. of State under Clinton, &amp;#34;The Global Warming Tipping Point,&amp;#34; The Globalist, http://www.theglobalist.com/storyid.aspx?StoryId=8523&#xD;
Moreover, we need to start reductions now in order to slow temperature rise later&#xD;
AND&#xD;
not burn fossil fuels and therefore do not pump CO2 into the atmosphere.&#xD;
&#xD;
====Warming is an existential threat====&#xD;
**Mazo 10 – PhD in Paleoclimatology from UCLA**&#xD;

The best estimates for global warming to the end of the century range from 2&#xD;
AND&#xD;
adaptation to these extremes would mean profound social, cultural and political changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
====Warming is the largest impact – its certainty requires that we transition away from current trends in policy making – we must orient our ethical questions towards the effects of a transforming climate on the most vulnerable nations in the world – this ethic assures we prevent the annihilation of the most vulnerable**====&#xD;
**Gordon 7**&#xD;
Ruth Gordon, Professor of Law at Villinova University, &amp;#34;The Climate of Environmental Justice: Taking Stock: Climate Change and the Poorest Nations: Further Reflections on Global Inequality&amp;#34;. Colorado Law Review, Lexis&#xD;
There is no longer any question that the earth~’s climate is warming. We can&#xD;
AND&#xD;
a slow death in ecologically vulnerable and technologically lacking low-income nations.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
====Global warming disproportionately effects the worlds most vulnerable populations – continued emissions affect all functions critical to a healthy and sustainable life====&#xD;
**Goldman 11 – MD, Representative for the American Public Health Association**&#xD;
Lynn Goldman, MD, Representative for the American Public Health Association, 2-9-2011, &amp;#34;ENERGY AND TAX PREVENTION ACT OF 2011,&amp;#34; CQ Congressional Testimony, Lexis&#xD;
Climate change is a public health issue and is one of the greatest threats to &#xD;
AND&#xD;
among our most vulnerable populations, children, the elderly and the poor.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
====No ethical principle justifies the inequality of climate change – mitigation is the utmost ethical imperative because it is the only thing that address structural injustice ====&#xD;
**Burkett 8 – Professor of Law**&#xD;
Maxine Burkett, Associate Professor, University of Colorado Law School, 2008, &amp;#34;Just Solutions to Climate Change: A Climate Justice Proposal for a Domestic Clean Development Mechanism,&amp;#34; 56 Buffalo L. Rev. 169, Lexis&#xD;
The emerging field of &amp;#34;climate justice&amp;#34; is concerned with the intersection of race&#xD;
AND&#xD;
off militate in favor of distribution bending steeply in favor of the poor.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
===Plan ===&#xD;
&#xD;
====Plan: The United States federal government should extend the Production Tax Credit of 2.2 cents per kilowatt-hour of electricity produced from wind energy for four years. ====&#xD;
&#xD;
===Solvency ===&#xD;
&#xD;
**====Wind industry growth is increasing, but PTC extension and predictability are vital to making wind a sustainable source of energy- failure to extend the PTC causes wind to fold.====**&#xD;
**Orcutt ~’12**&#xD;
Mike Orcutt, Technology Review~’s Research Editor, Does the Wind Production Tax Credit Matter?, August 17, 2012, http://www.technologyreview.com/news/428927/does-the-wind-production-tax-credit-matter/&#xD;
The fast-growing but still relatively tiny U.S. wind industry is &#xD;
AND&#xD;
anticipate much lower wind capacity additions in the absence of federal tax incentives. &#xD;
&#xD;
====Must transition from natural gas—development of clean energy necessary to solve warming in the long run====&#xD;
**Friedman ~’12 **&#xD;
Thomas L., Friedman, NYT Op-Ed columnist, Pulitzer Prize winner, author, &amp;#34;Get it Right on Gas,&amp;#34; 8/4/12 [[www.nytimes.com/2012/08/05/opinion/sunday/friedman-get-it-right-on-gas.html?_r=4%26ref=opinion-http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/05/opinion/sunday/friedman-get-it-right-on-gas.html?_r=4%26ref=opinion]] AD 8/17/12&#xD;
That is the question — because natural gas is still a fossil fuel. The &#xD;
AND&#xD;
have to apply them, too, so everyone has the same cost basis&#xD;
&#xD;
===Framework ===&#xD;
&#xD;
====We are civil society actors debating about dystopian imagery towards the end of transforming domestic energy policy and avoiding preventable catastrophic consequences produced by irresponsible actions.====&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
====This framework transforms the debate community into a weak public capable of influencing public policy through preventative foresight- we are the concerned citizenry that shape public discussion of warming and push for more cooperative IR approaches====&#xD;
**Kurasawa ~’4**, (Fuyuki, Assistant Prof. of Sociology @ York University, Cautionary Tales, Constellations Vol. 11, No. 4, Blackwell Synergy)&#xD;
In the twenty-first century, the lines of political cleavage are being drawn &#xD;
AND&#xD;
a position to ~’move up~’ and become  institutionalized via strong publics.7   &#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
====And, this culture of foresight is crucial if we are to avert the impact of climate change- we must be willing to transform debate in order to galvanize cooperation on long-term issues. Anything else lets nationalism and fundamentalism fill the void.====&#xD;
**Kurasawa ~’4,** (Fuyuki, Assistant Prof. of Sociology @ York University, Cautionary Tales, Constellations Vol. 11, No. 4, Blackwell Synergy)&#xD;
In addition, farsightedness has become a priority in world affairs due to the  appearance &#xD;
AND&#xD;
case of the spiraling African and Asian AIDS pandemics, appear  particularly glaring.  &#xD;
 &#xD;
&#xD;
====And, within this framework we must orient ourselves towards concern for future generations- the alternative is a regression into concern for only immediate problems, making warming irreversible and locking down cooperative approaches to international relations. ====&#xD;
**Kurasawa ~’4,** (Fuyuki, Assistant Prof. of Sociology @ York University, Cautionary Tales, Constellations Vol. 11, No. 4, Blackwell Synergy)&#xD;
&#xD;
In the previous section, I described how the capacity to produce, disseminate, &#xD;
AND&#xD;
the basis of which civic associations can enact the work of preventive foresight.   &#xD;
&#xD;
====Public understanding of climate change is low—debate is critical to bring awareness of conceptual solutions and the risks of climate change====&#xD;
**Weber and Stern 11—professor @ Center for Research on Environmental Studies @ Columbia**&#xD;
Elke U. and Paul C, &amp;#34;Public Understanding of Climate Change in the United States&amp;#34; American Psychologist Vol. 66, No. 4, 315–328 (May/June) &#xD;
The trajectory of public understanding frustrates many climate scientists and educators who see climate risks &#xD;
AND&#xD;
region to weather even the most pessimistic climate projections if action begins soon.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
====Our deployment of scenarios of risk is enabling – we need to visualize climate change impacts to shake up political apathy====&#xD;
**Beck 10** – Professor of Sociology @ Munich&#xD;
Ulrich, sociology prof at Munich, &amp;#34;Climate for Change, or How to Create a Green Modernity?&amp;#34;, Theory Culture Society 2010 27: 254&#xD;
Sixth thesis: The political explosiveness of global risks is largely a function of their &#xD;
AND&#xD;
powerful as this hunger for modernization or it is condemned to repeated failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
====And, contesting possible futures is an affirmation of life- it allows us to gamble on the future as open, making subversion of disciplinary subjectivities possible====&#xD;
**Dunmire ~’3**, (Patricia, Assoc. Prof. of English @ Kent State U, Preempting the future: rhetoric and ideology of the future in political discourse, Discourse and Society, Vol 16(4): 481–513 10.1177, muse)&#xD;
