==== Contention 1: “The Survival Game” ====

==== Contemporary education models have proffered a structure which has relied heavily on role playing exercises designed to get students to argue about scenarios as a means of teaching how to deal with situations of conflict. One of the central role playing games used in academia is the “The Survival Game”—sometimes known as “The Lifeboat Game”—where students¶ are assigned to decide who is worthy of survival in a shipwreck: the priest, the lawyer, the¶ pregnant mother, angry teenager, etc.  The game forces students to make arguments on the advantages to placing particular individuals in the lifeboat.  At KU Dr. Harris tried a variation of the game in which he told students to imagine they were a guard at a Nazi prison camp with the ability to choose to save one person from among different types of prisoners facing the gas chamber.   To Dr. Harris surprise the students jumped into intense debates over the advantages to saving the Army Captain who could help maintain prison discipline vs. the Jewish homosexual who was starving to death any way.  Students readily embraced the role playing model and did not question whether they should be making such choices in the first place.  The correct answer to the game is to refuse to make a choice because the underlying assumptions of the scenario mask the unethical acts involved.  These “make a choice” scenario games are a fundamentally flawed pedagogical model. ====

global workforce economy.

==== This year’s debate topic is a version of “The Survival Game”.  The topic committee constructed a topic that assigns affirmative debaters in the classroom space to choose which techno-energy type to put into the production lifeboat.  Affirmatives can argue the benefits to choosing one particular type of energy technology over others.  The fact that making those choices masks the underlying question of whether we should be endorsing production as a starting point is ignored as affirmative students make their choices.  The fact that each energy system places burdens on local populations who are effected by the energy choice they make is rendered invisibility.  Affirmative debaters all year take there assignment and try to pick the energy type that offers the most benefits and damages the fewest people in exactly the same way that students argue the benefits for putting particular people in the lifeboat.  Every choice is ultimately tragic. ====
