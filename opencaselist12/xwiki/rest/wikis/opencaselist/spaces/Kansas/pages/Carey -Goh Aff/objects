A space-based radar concept is currently in work at an Air Force Research Laboratory. It¶ requires large amounts of electrical power and the engineers have found no optimum solution to¶ the problem.¶ 31¶ The space-based radar in use today is limited in resolution and coverage by onorbit power.¶ 32¶ As with the space-based laser and RF jamming device, a space-based radar¶ receiving power from a solar power satellite eliminates this problem.
