The requirements thus far are primarily negative.  The ambiguists must say “no” 
AND
. In other words, contestation rests on some basic agreement or harmony.

2) Role of the negative: Our interpretation has a clear vision for the function of the negative team. We must disprove the desirability of their advocacy. If there is no predictable limit on what the affirmative can do, the negative is excluded from the debate. We become passive observers of their presentation. Our interpretation is the least exclusionary because it provides a place in the debate for negative teams. 
3) Process impact:– this is the only academic forum where we get education based on clash and competition. If we aren’t able to prepare in advance for affirmatives the round becomes a 2 hour conference presentation about whatever books and articles they are reading, This education o/w any content specific education because
 a) you can get content specific education in any other forum 
b) Without critical thinking skills developed through clash and competition we can’t effectively act on content-specific knowledge

c) without clash-based education we are likely to come to the wrong conclusions about the content b/c we don’t see both sides
4)  Epistemology: All aff claims are uncertain. Unpredictable advocacies are not subject to the type of rigorous scrutiny and testing that is required for a claim to be granted. If their claims are not predictable it means they are not subject to rigorous testing and should not be treated as true. You cannot evaluate the validity of their aff arguments until you conclude that it is topical because unTopical advocacies are not subject to the same amount of scrutiny and testing.  This means the aff can only claim offense from their interpretation, not from the value of the 1AC since the value of the 1AC has not been established through rigorous debate. 

5) Switch-side debating on the topic is uniquely important.  It allows debaters to become better advocates and increases critical thinking
Dybvig and Iverson 99
Kristin Chisholm Dybvig, and Joel O. Iverson, Can Cutting Cards Carve into Our Personal Lives: An Analysis of Debate Research on Personal Advocacy, http://www.uvm.edu/~debate/dybvigiverson1000.html
Not all debate research appears to generate personal advocacy and challenge peoples&amp;#39; assumptions. Debaters

6) This debate is about competing interpretations. They must have a sustainable interpretation of debate that includes their affirmative they should lose. If their interpretation provides no limit on affirmative action, it doesn’t matter if we have good arguments against their aff b/c they can’t provide an interpretation that would allow their aff and protect good, predictable debates in the future.
