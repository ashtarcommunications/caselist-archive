**Advocacy Statement**- USFG should increase accessibility and inclusion to clean and cheap energy by funding and installing Sustainable Energy Utilities (SEUs) in the U.S just like the NDT/CEDA debate community should increase accessibility and inclusion to stylistic minorities.

Why is it that waste facilities are much more likely to be placed in black communities?

&amp;#123;&amp;#123;id name=&amp;#34;_GoBack&amp;#34;/}}The Center of Social Inclusion explores the ways to distribute renewable energy sources for communities of color. They have found that the lack of planning and involvement in the energy process has left many communities of color isolated and in the dark. People of color do have a heightened concern about the environmental issues because their communities suffer from the unhealthy energy production practices.

SEUs are alternative energy companies that are state funded but ran by the communities. Using this alternative energy source will solve for the pollution of these communities and also results in more community involvement.

Another example was a black church in Washington DC that is powered by an alternative energy source. It was a significant breakthrough in the black community and provided clean energy

According to Dr. Benjamin Chavis, this is Racial discrimination in environmental policy making and unequal enforcement in the environmental laws. There is a deliberate targeting of the black communities for toxic waste facilities and the presence of life threatening poisons and pollutants in these communities. And also there has been a history of excluding people of color from leadership in environmental movements.

Expert Robert D. Bullard explains the Not In My BackYard phenomenon that occurs with environmentalist. Hazardous waste, garbage dumps, and polluting industries were likely to end up in somebodyâ€™s backyard. But whose backyard exactly??? Most likely it would be the poor, powerless, black communities rather than the affluent suburbs. This is a continued pattern and has negative implications for black communities.
