====The United States federal government should establish a cap-and-trade system for carbon emissions in the United States.  The federal government should reduce the corporate income tax and business capital-gains taxes====

====Targeting specific industries and technology fails—-cap and trade is key to market-based solutions that solve the case better====
Morris et al 12 Adele C. Morris, Fellow and Deputy Director of the. Climate and Energy Economics project at Brookings,  Pietro S. Nivola, Charles Schultze, Brookings Scholars, &amp;#34;CLEAN ENERGY:REVISITING THE CHALLENGES OF INDUSTRIAL POLICY&amp;#34; June 4 www.brookings.edu/~~/media/research/files/papers/2012/6/04%20clean%20energy%20morris%20nivola%20schultze/04_clean_energy_morris_nivola_schultze.pdf
Public investments of these magnitudes, targeted at specific industries, arguably constitute an industrial policy, albeit a sectoral one, unlike the earlier proposals of the 1980~’s —that is, a government strategy to steer resources toward select producers or technologies. The rationale and efficacy of these clean-energy expenditures call for scrutiny.
Proponents offer numerous reasons for scaling up particular energy technologies at the taxpayer~’s expense. 
AND
on C02 that reflects the environmental harm associated with use of fossil fuels.

AND

====Incentives cause government dependence and undermines incentives for innovation ====
Loris 11 Nicolas Loris is an analyst in the Heritage Foundation~’s Roe Institute of Economic Policy Studies. &amp;#34;Power Down the Subsidies to Energy Producers&amp;#34; Aug 3  www.heritage.org/research/commentary/2011/08/power-down-the-subsidies-to-energy-producers
America has an energy addiction - and it~’s not an addiction to oil, as many politicians would have you think. It~’s an addiction to government subsidies. The addicts, you see, are energy producers, not the consumers.
Their growing dependence on federal handouts is the real cause of America~’s energy crisis. Energy subsidies have needlessly wasted taxpayer dollars, retarded commercialization of new technologies and failed to reduce our reliance on foreign energy sources. Washington would do well to end all energy subsidies.
Energy subsidies come in numerous forms ranging from direct expenditures to targeted tax breaks, from production mandates to loan guarantees. Basically, any public policy that favorsthe production or consumption of one type of energy over another can be considered a subsidy.
None of them come cheap. According to the Energy Information Agency, the federal government gave the energy industry %248.2 billion in subsidies and financial aid in 1999. This figure more than doubled to %2417.9 billion in 2007 and more than doubled again to %2437.2 billion last year.
But the damage subsidies inflict on our economy extends well beyond direct costs. A special endorsement from the government artificially props up that technology. This reduces the incentive for the producer to become cost-competitive, stifles innovation and encourages government dependence.
The federal government has no business picking commercial winners and losers. That~’s the job of the marketplace. Indeed, it~’s doubly damaging when government decides to manipulate the market through subsidies, because government - almost invariably - picks losers. That~’s not surprising, because companies that seek handouts most strenuously are those that cannot compete without them.

**De LaHunt, 6 - Assistant Director for Environmental Health and Safety Services in Colorado College~’s Facilities Services department (John, &amp;#34;Perverse and unintended&amp;#34; Journal of Chemical Health and Safety, July-August, Science direct) //jl-cl**

Incentives are defined as promises made in exchange for performance; ¶ rewarded after the performance occurs (Mahoney, 1979; 1989; Maxwell, 2000: 245-¶ 247). The sequence is as follows: promise – performance – rewards. Rewards are ¶ defined as the consequence of performance. Here the sequence is performance¶ followed by rewards.
