A massive earthquake and tsunami off the coast of Japan spark a series of equipment failures, nuclear meltdowns, and releases of radioactive materials at the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant. Many workers are killed in the ensuing meltdowns, six workers exceed lifetime legal limits for radiation, and more than 300 received significant radiation doses. In a statement just one day after the event, President Barack Obama ordered a safety review of all U.S. nuclear plants. 

&amp;#34;When we see a crisis like the one in Japan, we have a responsibility to learn from this event,&amp;#34;  the President said. &amp;#34;My heart goes out to the people of Japan during this enormous tragedy,&amp;#34; he wrote in the condolence book at the Japanese embassy in Washington D.C. several days later. &amp;#34;And as it recovers, the memory of those who have been lost will remain in our hearts, and will serve only to strengthen the friendship between our two countries. May God Bless the people of Japan.&amp;#34;  

The memory of these deaths and the invocation of the many radiation “victims” and “refugees” are mobilized in the public discourse surrounding increasing nuclear energy production.

 “From a business perspective, it is perfectly understandable that the nuclear industry would feel the need to assuage public fears in the wake of the Fukushima crisis. Since the late 1970s, the industry has largely been in a state of stagnation; the tide of US public opinion began to turn against nuclear power following the near disaster at Three Mile Island. Of the 104 plants currently in operation, ground was broken on all of them before 1974. To expand its business, the industry turned to exports, finding a friend in President Bill Clinton, who approved the sale of nuclear technology to such countries as China, Brazil and Argentina. More recently, Barack Obama has proven nothing short of a godsend for the nuclear industry in the US. Along with clean, renewable energy sources, Obama has long considered nuclear power an important alternative to coal and other dirty, foreign fossil fuels. In the Democratic debate during the 2008 presidential race, he made his position clear: &amp;#34;I actually think that we should explore nuclear power as part of the energy mix.&amp;#34; Even as he has acknowledged that &amp;#34;nothing is completely failsafe&amp;#34; in the midst of the Fukushima crisis, he has remained steadfast in his support of nuclear energy. As recently as 17 March, he stated, &amp;#34;Nuclear energy is an important part of our own energy future.&amp;#34; While it was George W Bush who established $18.5bn in federal loan guarantees for the construction of new plants, it is Obama who declared his intentions to nearly triple that figure to $54.5bn.”  

With government backed nuclear expansion imminent, and tasked with undertaking and securitizing against the risk of radiation exposure, 

“On March 12, 2012, based on the prioritized task force recommendations, the NRC issued the first regulatory requirements for the nation’s 104 operating reactors based on the lessons-learned at Fukushima Dai-ichi. The NRC continues to evaluate and act on the lessons learned to ensure that appropriate safety enhancements are implemented at nuclear power plants here in the U.S. In accordance with Commission direction, the NRC’s activities are being led by a steering committee comprised of senior NRC management. Additionally, the NRC established the Japan Lessons Learned Project Directorate, a group of more than 20 full-time employees focused exclusively on implementing the lessons learned.”  

And just over one month ago,

 “A group of American scientists met in Tokyo on Tuesday to study last year&amp;#39;s Fukushima nuclear accident in hopes of finding lessons to improve the safety of U.S. atomic power reactors. Norman Neureiter, head of the 22-member committee of the National Academy of Sciences, said the tsunami-spawned disaster at Fukushima nuclear power plant and its continuing impact have caused widespread concerns about the safety of nuclear energy. &amp;#34;We are trying to look at the whole experience and to take from that lessons which can be applied to increasing safety of nuclear power,&amp;#34; he told The Associated Press during a coffee break between technical sessions. Neureiter said the committee is hearing from Japanese officials and will conduct its own investigation. He said the findings would be valuable to the nuclear industry throughout the world. A tsunami generated by a powerful earthquake hit the Fukushima nuclear plant in March 2011, knocking out power and cooling systems and causing partial meltdowns in three reactors. More than 100,000 people evacuated from the area are still unable to return to their homes in Fukushima due to radiation concerns.    
Obama’s symbolic speech acts, the Japan Lessons Learned initiative, and subsequent NRC Security Restrictions on nuclear power are dominant acts of mourning that ontologically disavow “radiated” victims and refugees as objects, a social surplus of difference and alterity to be eliminated. It is an ethical imperative to radically historicize the narrative of securitizing nuclear power en route to energy production. This act reveals that there is no totality which we can bring society together with, solving fascist backlash, totalitarianism, and destruction of difference.

The fear of nuclear annihilation has become trivial; its inevitability cannot be contested. The possibility of nuclear destruction existed before the events of Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and will continue long after Fukushima. The fear persists however, and prompts the “clean” and “healthy” body politic to securitize against those affected by radiation. This securitizing takes the forms security restrictions for nuclear and monumental acts of mourning where “victims” and “refugees” are presented as already dead and excluded.

The liberal-humanist reaction to Fukushima produces virulent forms of racism and nationalism. But instead of a glorified American referent, ‘us’ becomes the human community who look endlessly upon the hibakusha as the abject reminders of our rightness and cleanliness. The social surplus maintains the human community by upholding genetic, viral, and bacteriological standards

This affirmation is the rupture of dominant State history in the context of nuclear power discourse – molecular struggles such as this round, this moment are key; failure to resist the totalization of history is complicit in the formation and encouragement of racism, sexism, and heterosexism. This complicity depends on and makes necessary ongoing political sacrifice of alterity to the gods of realism who cannot save us, rather we must start raising hell to save ourselves!
