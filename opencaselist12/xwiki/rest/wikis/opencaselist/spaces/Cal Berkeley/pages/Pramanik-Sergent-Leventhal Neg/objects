====Interpretation: Production incentives are direct monetary support contingent on electricity generation - that~’s different than investment incentives ====
**Doris, NREL researcher, 12**
(Elizabeth Doris, researcher at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, &amp;#34;Policy Building Blocks: Helping Policymakers Determine Policy Staging for the Development of Distributed PV Markets,&amp;#34; Paper to be presented at the 2012 World Renewable Energy Forum, 5/13-5/17, http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy12osti/54801.pdf-http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy12osti/54801.pdf)

3.3 Market Expansion
This stage of policy development targets the development of projects and includes both incentives that 
AND
the design and implementation of effective market incentives. Specific policy types include:
• Incentives. In the context of this framework, incentives are defined as direct 
AND
is prepared for project development. There are three primary types of incentives:
• Investment incentives directly alter the first cost of technologies. These incentives can take 
AND
direct capital investment, but instead prioritizes reduction in pay-back period.
• Production incentives provide payment for electricity produced from the distributed electricity. These are 
AND
incentives have the potential to be invested in projects that do not materialize).
• Feed-in-Tariffs. This incentive type reduces investment risk by providing fixed payments for projects based on the levelized cost of renewable energy generation. This (among other design characteristics) distinguishes feed-in-tariffs from production-based incentives, which are based on monetizing the value of the electricity to the grid or the value to the electricity purchaser.

====Energy production requires the generation of electricity ====
US **EIA** (Energy Information Administration) - October 19, **2011**, Annual Energy Review 2010, http://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/annual/pdf/aer.pdf

====Violation – R%26D is not a financial incentive====
**Doris** et al – National Renewable Energy Laboratory (US DOE) – Dec **2009**
Elizabeth Doris, Jaquelin Cochran, and Martin Vorum, Energy Efficiency Policy in the United States: Overview of Trends at Different Levels of Government http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy10osti/46532.pdf

The industrial sector, which accounts for 31% of U.S. primary energy consumption (EIA 2008), spans a wide variety of subsectors, all of which have different energy needs. Thus policies to improve energy efficiency in this sector are designed to allow flexibility across a number of differing industry needs, including:
1. Incentives, both financial (e.g., loans and grants for industries to upgrade equipment) and non-financial (e.g., expedited permitting)
2. Technical assistance, including programs, such as energy audits, that help industries identify and implement energy-efficiency programs
3. Research and development.
The federal government offers all three policy types. It offers tax incentives for the manufacturing and home building subsectors, and loans that require energy savings and emission reductions from participating companies. These incentives are flexible enough to apply to a broad array of industry subsectors. In addition, the federal government offers several general industry programs that provide plant-specific technical assistance to highly energy-intensive industries.
State government programs focus on financial incentives, including tax credits, loans, and grants, to offset costs to industries for adopting efficient technologies. Many states also offer programs that can provide customized support to individual industries as part of broader energy efficiency programs. These programs allow funds to be spent on both incentives and technical assistance.
Local government programs related to energy efficiency are often designed with the goal of attracting industries, and thus jobs, to the locality. These programs primarily rely on non-financial incentives, such as expedited permitting for &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; industries.

**DeFreitas, 12** —- covered all manner of green technology for EarthTechling since 2009 (Susan, 3/10/2012, &amp;#34;WWF Index: U.S. A Leader In Cleantech,&amp;#34; http://www.earthtechling.com/2012/03/wwf-index-u-s-a-leader-in-cleantech/)

How~’s the U.S. doing when it comes to nurturing clean technology start-ups? Not too shabby at all, according to Coming Clean: The Global Cleantech Innovation Index 2012, a new report from the World Wildlife Federation (WWF), which ranked the U.S. fifth in the world for cleantech start-up creation, after Denmark, Israel, Sweden, and Finland.
That means that while countries like Germany and Scotland are driving renewable energy generation full speed ahead with government policies, partnerships, and carbon reduction targets, the countries ranked highest in the WWF~’s index are those doing the most to nurture the entrepreneurial approach, leading the world in fostering cleantech innovation.
Thirty-eight countries were evaluated on 15 indicators related to the creation and commercialization of cleantech start-ups, generating an index measuring each one~’s potential (relative to its economic size), to produce entrepreneurial cleantech start-up companies and bring clean technology innovations to the market over the next 10 years.
While the U.S. came in fifth overall, in absolute terms (without factoring in economic size), the U.S. leads in many measures of cleantech innovation, as it currently boasts the greatest public cleantech R%26D budget and the greatest number of cleantech start-ups and investors, as well as the most venture capital, private equity, and M%26A deals in cleantech.
While North America and northern Europe lead with cleantech start-ups overall, the index also finds the Asia Pacific region performing well in terms of scaling up entrepreneurial cleantech companies to wider commercial success and revenue creation. And though it currently places 13th on the index, China was highlighted as leading in cleantech manufacturing, making a strong showing in early-stage growth, and indicating the potential to produce more early stage innovation in the future.
China is also rapidly gaining access to funding due to its success in raising money for cleantech-focused funds. (It has been home to the majority of cleantech IPOs since 2009, many of which listed on the recently established ChiNext board of the Shenzhen stock exchange.)
Another emerging cleantech start-up leader? India, which currently scores 12th on the index, but is performing well in fund-raising towards cleantech-focused funds and has shown plenty activity in later stage cleantech companies.

====Interpretation – Financial incentives reduce producer costs – that~’s distinct from creating more a favorable market ====
**Benson 7 –** J.D, University of Iowa (Christine C., Winter, &amp;#34;STUDENT NOTE: Putting Your Money Where Your Mouth Is: The Varied Success of Biofuel Incentive Policies in the United States and the European Union&amp;#34;, 16 Transnat~’l L. %26 Contemp. Probs. 633, Lexis Law)
There are two main ways a government can promote an industry requiring support to survive and prosper. A government may use financial incentives to reduce costs to the industry at one or several points in the chain of production. n139 A government may also use regulatory mandates to impose a minimum usage requirement for certain products produced by the industry. n140 
Both the United States and the EU have implemented mandates in regard to biofuels. 
AND
Therefore, mandates are usually accompanied by some type of financial incentive. n144 
Financial incentives take many forms. Loans, grants, production payments, tax credits or deductions, and tax exemptions all provide some type of financial assistance. n145 Loans and grants generally promote the development of an industry~’s infrastructure, research, and development. n146 Tax incentives are generally more focused on promoting long-term production of a product. n147 This Note focuses only on tax incentives, not loan and grant programs, for biofuels in the United States and the EU.

====Violation – FIT~’s are not a financial incentive – only indirectly create a better market====
Joanna **Lewis and** Ryan **Wiser** – Gtown STIA Prof / LAWRENCE BERKELEY NATIONAL LABORATORY – November **2005**, Fostering a Renewable Energy Technology Industry: An International Comparison of Wind Industry Policy Support Mechanisms, http://eetd.lbl.gov/ea/emp/reports/59116.pdf
Policy measures to support wind industry development can be grouped into two
categories: direct and indirect measures. Direct measures refer to policies that specifically target
AND
with feed-in tariffs, with varying¶ levels of success.7

====Vote Neg:====

====Predictable Limits – We added a qualifier to the word &amp;#34;incentive&amp;#34; precisely because it was too broad – Including non-financial incentives explodes the topic by several new ways of doing every aff.  Prefer our interpretation because it creates a clear, predictable line between incentives that change production costs per unit and mandates that increase overall demand. ====

====Ground – Testing the &amp;#34;financial&amp;#34; in financial incentive is core neg CP and solvency ground – using a non-financial mechanism guts DA links too because the way voters and markets react to subsidies and tax breaks is substantially different than to a minor change in what the government decides to buy.  ====

Implications of the California Case
Because renewable energy policy at the federal level is limited, California has taken a

renewable generation, there is nothing explicitly stopping them at the federal level.
Historically, this has worked to California~’s advantage. In the wake of the energy

Conclusion
Renewable energy policy is sure to continue evolving over the coming decades. Moving beyond

Topical affirmatives must affirm the resolution through instrumental defense of action by the United States Federal Government.  


B – Definitions
Should denotes an expectation of enacting a plan
American Heritage** Dictionary **2000** (Dictionary.com)**
should. The will to do something or have something take place: I shall go out if I feel like it.  

Federal government is the central government in Washington DC
Encarta Online 2005**, **
**http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_1741500781_6/United_States_(Government).html~~%23howtocite**
United States (Government), the combination of federal, state, and local laws, bodies, and agencies that is responsible for carrying out the operations of the United States. The federal government of the United States is centered in Washington, D.C.-http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761576320/Washington_D_C.html

Resolved implies a policy 
Louisiana House** 3-8-**2005**, **http://house.louisiana.gov/house-glossary.htm-http://house.louisiana.gov/house-glossary.htm** **
Resolution  A legislative instrument that generally is used for making declarations,  stating policies, and making decisions where some other form is not  required. A bill includes the constitutionally required enacting clause; a  resolution uses the term &amp;#34;resolved&amp;#34;. Not subject to a time limit for  introduction nor to governor~’s veto. ( Const. Art. III, §17(B) and House  Rules 8.11 , 13.1 , 6.8 , and 7.4) 


C – Vote neg – We have four net benefits
First is Decisionmaking
The primary purpose of debate should be to improve our skills as decision-makers.   We are all individual policy-makers who make choices every day that affect us and those around us.  We have an obligation to the people affected by our decisions to use debate as a method for honing these critical thinking and information processing abilities.  
Austin J. **Freeley and** David L. **Steinberg** – John Carroll University / U Miami – **2009**, Argumentation and Debate: Critical Thinking for Reasoned Decision Making, p. 1-4, googlebooks
After several days of intense debate, first the United States House of Representatives and 
AND
customer for out product, or a vote for our favored political candidate.


Additionally, The best route to improving decision-making is through discussion about public policy
A.	Mutually accessible information – There is a wide swath of literature on governmental policy topics – that ensures there will be informed, predictable, and in-depth debate over the aff~’s decision.  Individual policymaking is highly variable depending on the person and inaccessible to outsiders.
B.	Harder decisions make better decisionmakers – The problems facing public policymakers are a magnitude greater than private decisions.  We all know plans don~’t actually happen, but practicing imagining the consequences of our decisions in the high-stakes games of public policymaking makes other decisionmaking easier.  


Second is Predictable Limits - The resolution proposes the question the negative is prepared to answer and creates a bounded list of potential affs for us to think about.  Debate has unique potential to change attitudes and grow critical thinking skills because it forces pre-round internal deliberation on a of a focused, common ground of debate
Robert E. **Goodin and** Simon J. **Niemeyer**- Australian National University- **2003**, 
When Does Deliberation Begin? Internal Reflection versus Public Discussion in Deliberative Democracy, POLITICAL STUDIES: 2003 VOL 51, 627–649, http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.0032-3217.2003.00450.x/pdf
What happened in this particular case, as in any particular case, was in 
AND
least one possible way of doing that for each of those key features.


Third is Dogmatism – Most problems are not black and white but have complex, uncertain interactions.  By declaring that _____ is always bad, they prevent us from understanding the nuances of an incredibly important and complex issue.  This is the epitome of dogmatism 
**Keller, et. al,**– Asst. professor School of Social Service Administration U. of Chicago - **2001**
(Thomas E., James K., and Tracly K., Asst. professor School of Social Service Administration U. of Chicago, professor of Social Work, and doctoral student School of Social Work, &amp;#34;Student debates in policy courses: promoting policy practice skills and knowledge through active learning,&amp;#34; Journal of Social Work Education, Spr/Summer 2001, EBSCOhost)
John Dewey, the philosopher and educational reformer, suggested that the initial advance in 
AND
systems, the learning process will be facilitated&amp;#34; (p. 28). 
The authors believe that involving students in substantive debates challenges them to learn and grow 
AND
yield a reevaluation and reconstruction of knowledge and beliefs pertaining to the issue.

Our method solves – Even if the resolution is wrong, having a devil~’s advocate in deliberation is vitally important to critical thinking skills and avoiding groupthink

**(Philosophy, Politics and Economics prof @ U of Penn, Poli Sci prof @  Yale), Reasoning is for arguing: Understanding the successes and failures of deliberation, Political Psychology, http://sites.google.com/site/hugomercier/publications**
Reasoning can function outside of its normal conditions when it is used purely internally. 
AND
suggestions have been made in the past (e.g., Bohman,
 2007; Sunstein, 2003, 2006), the present theory provides additional arguments 
AND
(e.g. Schweiger, Sandberg, %26 Ragan, 1986).

Their use of ontological blackness creates reliance on white superiority and erases individuality – ontological blackness opposes itself to whiteness, affirming white superiority by grounding blackness in suffering and the experience of anti-blackness – that reduces all experience to negative experience of racial constitution, which crushes individuality and causes social death

In chapter one Anderson defines religious criticism, cultural criticism, and other terms that

Their attempt to ontologically ground blackness is dependent on whiteness for the legitimacy—this recreates a conception of blackness as dependent on suffering, making resistance to oppression impossible within their framework.

At its best, African American criticism draws from critical theory and has an appreciation 
AND
as crisis theologies; they remain theologies in a crisis of legitimation.14 
The blackness affirmed by the 1AC is the blackness that whiteness created—the affirmative relies on the same type race theory of identity which characterizes white supremacy, locking essentialized understandings of blackness which exclude alternate configurations of black subjectivity—you should use your ballot to reject racialized identity construction, thus cutting off the cognitive foundation from which racism is even able to operate.

The history of racism, while terrible, does not represent exceptional/gratuitous violence – white societies have produced equally excessive violence against one another – refuse their historiography because it relies on transforming an historically inaccurate claim about violence into an entire theory of ideology and subject formation
**Coates 13**
(Ta-Nehisi, senior editor for The Atlantic, &amp;#34;A Flawed America in Context&amp;#34;, February 13, 2013, http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/02/a-flawed-america-in-context/273546/)

Toward the end of our meal we began discussing how one can look at racism 
AND
though is this: Is this what we what we will always do?
Their gut check response will be that gratuitous violence is internal to white society and  that pre-colonization African societies were free of the violence produced by white culture – this claim is reactionary and historically inaccurate

Lesson One: the rejection of the idea that history exists solely to bolster our 
AND
of history~’s actors the full range of features, both laudable and regrettable. 
The American legal system and state are not inherently racist – their overly fatalistic narrative ignores massive progress and incorrectly assumes that the US uniquely represents a site of anti-blackness
**Farber 98**
(Daniel, Prof. of the Minnesota School of Law, &amp;#34;Is American Law Inherently Racist&amp;#34;, w/ Prof. Delgado, Berkeley Law Scholarship Repository, http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1211%26context=facpubs)
Let me begin with the vision of the American legal system that Professor Delgado presented 
AND
In some ways, I think we are doing considerably better than most.
The proper response to recurrent state/legal racism is protective measures – only legal reform can embed bulwarks against historical injustice
**Delgado 98**
(Richard, Jean N. Lindsley Professor of Law at the University of Colorado Law School, &amp;#34;Is American Law Inherently Racist&amp;#34;, Debate w/ Prof. Farber, Berkeley Law Scholarship Repository, http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1211%26context=facpubs)

AUDIENCE: If we accept the premise that American law is inherently racist, what 
AND
in other respects. I will address this point later in my talk.
~~if running short on time you can skip this~~ That turns the K – their assertion of an historically pure point of departure produces essentialism and re-creates the relations of domination they oppose – our aff overcomes their life-denying politics by building assemblages within the State that reverse relations of power to overcome relations of domination
We are all part of the institutions that oppress us – power relations work in 
AND
too and we~’re all implicated in these – ignores the way it creates fissures 
Newman ~’00, (Saul, Postdoctoral Fellow @ Macquarie University, &amp;#34;Anarchism and the Politics of Ressentiment&amp;#34;, muse)

Has anarchism as a political and social theory of revolution been invalidated because of the 
AND
within this world, renegotiating our position to enhance our possibilities of freedom.
All of their root cause and alt solvency args are epistemologically flawed – they presume that policies with racially disparate outcomes are produced by white institutional control – that allows them to neglect more complex policy issues about constituency formation and different interest groups with a neat narrative about the historical evolution of racism – in reality, non-white groups play an important role in advocating for policies with negative/racially disparate impacts
This position ignores 
**Farber 98**
(Daniel, Prof. of the Minnesota School of Law, &amp;#34;Is American Law Inherently Racist&amp;#34;, w/ Prof. Delgado, Berkeley Law Scholarship Repository, http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1211%26context=facpubs)

PROFESSOR FARBER: I thought I would begin by saying a little more about the 
AND
a lot more complicated than the simple reference to racism makes it appear. 
Even if true, assumptions that the law/state are inherently racist collapse aff solvency – they foreground the assumption of racism, which turns debate and dialogue into a witch hunt to determine which kind of racism people are guilty of – this assumption of guilt and hopelessness of reform collapses coalitions and public dialogue on racism that are pre-requisites to solvency
**Farber 98**

Finally, and I think perhaps this is the most significant practical problem, the

It competes – The plan invalidates existing restrictions but the counterplan revises the restriction without invalidating it
Kloppenberg, Professor of Law at Dayton, 06 
Symposium: Judicial Independence and Judicial Accountability: Searching for the Right Balance: Does Avoiding Constitutional Questions Promote Judicial Independence? 56 Case W. Res. 1031

This brief essay will examine only one aspect of avoidance, the use of the 
AND
different balance between furthering its primary legislative aims and invading constitutionally protected areas.
The counterplan solves the case but avoids the net benefits because utilizing the avoidance doctrine builds support
Hooper, Associate at Lightfoot, Franklin and White LLC, 02	
59 Wash and Lee L. Rev. 975

Despite criticism that the avoidance doctrine lends itself to judicial manipulation of legislative statutes - 
AND
respects Congress&amp;#39;s legislative supremacy and confirms the Court&amp;#39;s own task of judicial review.

Collett, Law Prof at St. Thomas, 10

It is axiomatic to the American political order that the legislature makes the laws,

V. Conclusion
In the American legal scheme, existing law controls the process of proposing new constitutional 
AND
will come to share conservatives&amp;#39; long-held discontent with expansive judicial review.

Shapiro Associate Director Brookings 03

Courts CP
AT: Perm Do Both
The permutation still links to the net benefit because it has the court issue a constitutional ruling which invalidates a restriction

AT: Perm Do the CP
The permutation is severance - reject severance permutations because counterplans become impossible without net benefits and severance perms don’t disprove that inclusion of the plan precludes achieving the maximally beneficial course of action
First, their plan text says something which proves it’s a constitutional ruling or invalidation
Second, topical affs must decrease the number of restrictions on production
a.	Restrictions are legal limitations on an activity 
Gerald N. Hill and Kathleen T. Hill – 2005, the Free Dictionary, http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Restrictions
restriction n. any limitation on activity, by statute, regulation or contract provision. In multi-unit real estate developments, condominium and cooperative housing projects, managed by homeowners&amp;#39; associations or similar organizations are usually required by state law to impose restrictions on use. Thus, the restrictions are part of the &amp;#34;covenants, conditions and restrictions,&amp;#34; intended to enhance the use of common facilities and property, recorded and incorporated into the title of each owner.
That means that 
b.	Reduce means to make smaller
Merriam-Webster – 12, http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/reduce
a : to draw together or cause to converge : consolidate reduce all the questions to one
b (1) : to diminish in size, amount, extent, or number reduce taxes reduce the likelihood of war (2) : to decrease the volume and concentrate the flavor of by boiling add the wine and reduce the sauce for two minutes
c : to narrow down : restrict the Indians were reduced to small reservations
d : to make shorter : abridge
Constitutional avoidance is fundamentally distinct – it interprets a restriction instead of reducing restrictions by holding a restriction void

Manning&amp;#39;s myopia-his inability or unwillingness to see the constitutional forest through the legislative 
AND
in fact . . . an absurdity too gross to be insisted on.&amp;#34;
The permutation can’t be the counterplan because the counterplan does not invalidate anything – it merely creates resistance to government action
Morrison, Law Prof at Cornell, 06
106 Colum. L. Rev. 1189

Although the most common accounts of modern avoidance proceed along the lines of the judicial 
AND
rules that raise obstacles to particular governmental actions without barring those actions entirely.&amp;#34;
The permutation severs – the affirmatives invalidation cannot be the counterplans avoidance which merely makes governmental action more difficult
Morrison, Law Prof at Cornell, 06
106 Colum. L. Rev. 1189

To be sure, the mechanism of constitutional enforcement at work in avoidance is not 
AND
that claim for the judiciary, the same should follow for the executive.



Solvency – Precedent
The counterplan creates effective precedent without making a constitutional ruling
Slocum, Law Prof at Florida Coastal, 07

The avoidance canon has been particularly important in ensuring judicial review of immigration decisions.

to the non-criminal aliens than a constitutional decision would have been.
The counterplan solves better - underenforcement

Although the legitimate use of the avoidance canon in immigration cases depends on the 
AND
the avoidance canon would still be needed in order to protect those rights.

Norms – creates awareness in future relevant situations
Morrison, Law Prof at Cornell, 06
106 Colum. L. Rev. 1189

On this account, the overarching norm implemented by the avoidance canon is that if 
AND
a restatement of the canon&amp;#39;s point, not an indictment of it. 99

Solvency – Judicial Independence
Statutory interpretation key to judicial independence without provoking fights with other branches
Kloppenberg, Professor of Law at Dayton, 06 
Symposium: Judicial Independence and Judicial Accountability: Searching for the Right Balance: Does Avoiding Constitutional Questions Promote Judicial Independence? 56 Case W. Res. 1031

Rhetoric about judicial activism abounds in modern political campaigns. Bar associations and judicial organizations 
AND
adjudication for federal courts. Many state courts employ similar presumptions about avoidance. 


Solvency – AT: Constitutional Ruling Key
The counterplan allows promotion of constitutional values without making a constitutional ruling
Morrison, Law Prof at Cornell, 06
106 Colum. L. Rev. 1189

Two caveats are in order here, however. First, although the constitutional enforcement 
AND
, it must return to the legislative process and clarify its intended meaning.

====Rare earth minerals produce massive toxic waste and environmental destruction – increased demand motivates poor environmental accounting and encourages global ecological violence for short-term profit====

===2NC Consumption Framework===

====The aff~’s calls for pragmatism and specificity are a farce – their change in energy strategy represents conscious adoption of larger institutional logics, not an incremental change in existing policy – only radical analysis of the energy system takes the aff~’s change seriously and avoids error replication====
**Byrne %26 Toly 6**
(Josh, director of the Center for Energy and Environmental Policy and distinguished professor of energy and climate policy at the University of Delaware, Noah, Associate Professor of Urban Studies and Politics %26 International Relations, Director of Urban Studies Program at Wheaton, &amp;#34;Energy as a Social Project: Recovering a Discourse&amp;#34;, pgs. 1-32 in Transforming Power: Energy, Environment, and Society in Conflict, eds. Josh Byrne, Noah Toly, and Leigh Glover)

When measured in social and political-economic terms, the current energy discourse appears 
AND
, leave modernism undisturbed (except, perhaps, for its environmental performance).

====Framing of waste/pollution is key – focus on industrial sources distorts data collection and resource allocation to exclude individuals – best evidence supports a shift to incorporate the role of the individual====
**Vandenbergh 5**
(Michael P, Associate Professor of Law at Vanderbilt University Law School, &amp;#34;The Individual as Polluter&amp;#34;, Environmental Law Reporter 2005)

Even if individual behavior contributes a large share of many types of pollution, a

In recent years the discipline of IR has been characterised by an explosion of competing

How, though, does this focus on government act to re-orient the 
AND
perception through world-disclosure such that previously invisible consequences become visible.33

====And – he concludes that specific critiques of governance solve – that~’s what we do.====

===AT: Decisionmaking/Predictability===

====They misidentify the sources of environmental destruction – targeting &amp;#34;point sources&amp;#34; of pollution like large-scale corporate energy producers scapegoats corporations, exonerating individuals for everyday consumption practices – their misdiagnosis produces error replication and destroys the environmental public sphere====

In the early eighties, an old debate within economics resurfaced surrounding something called Jevons~’ 
AND
the use of a resource in turn increases the consumption of that resource.


====Sequencing DA – centering consumption as a subject of ethical concern is a pre-requisite to the aff – their &amp;#34;production-focused&amp;#34; change to energy policy only marginalizes consumption practices by treating them as a given outside of politics====

For present purposes, the third and final point about how neoclassicism marginalizes consumption concerns

====We must shift the level of analysis away from regulation of large-scale industrial pollution/waste towards an individual analysis of pollution/waste – individuals are the largest remaining source of pollution and drive practices of overconsumption – only re-framing policy approaches can create new regulatory innovations that spill over to address larger sources of pollution====
**Vandenbergh 5**
(Michael P, Associate Professor of Law at Vanderbilt University Law School, &amp;#34;The Individual as Polluter&amp;#34;, Environmental Law Reporter 2005)

The federal environmental statutes enacted since 1970 have produced gains in environmental quality in the

to regulatory innovations for traditional industrial sources and new generation sources as well.

**====Secondly – you should use a longer time horizon to calculate impacts – there is a historical bias toward privileging shorter horizons that we have to consciously correct for humanity to survive====**
-	This is alt solvency – can use this debate to encourage people to think differently which is a starting point to solving these problems
o	Simultaneously saying doing what we~’re saying will help people transform themselves and we should do it within this debate – the function within the debate is to focus on structural impacts, be suspicious about arguments that rely on other people~’s behavior 
o	Teaches the k how to use your framework to judge the particular debate you~’re in and the process that you~’re asking the judge to carry out is a performance of the alternative
o	&amp;#34;our process of engaging in a new evaluative criterion is itself a performance of cultural change away from the way we see things now&amp;#34; – a problem and its solution only exist in respect to its framework of evaluation 
**Ehrlich %26 Ehrlich 13**

Until very recently, our ancestors had no reason to respond genetically or culturally to

them will need strengthening, and new institutions will need to be formed. 



===AT: Conservation Good===

**====The ambiguity of sustainable development de-politicizes consumption and directs attention towards technology – only directly challenging consumption produces effective politics====**
**Princen et al 2**
(Thomas, Professor at the School of Natural Resources and Environment at the University of Michigan, Ken Conca, Associate Professor of Government and Politics and Director of the Harrison Program on the Future Global Agenda at the University of Maryland, Michael Maniates, Professor of Environmental Science and Political Science Allegheny College, Confronting Consumption, pgs. 1-2)

Perhaps it is no surprise, then, that comforting terms like sustainable development have 
AND
-pound gorilla in the living room that almost everyone chooses to ignore.

**====The rebound effect means that technological gains in efficiency ultimately cause more consumption – renewables don~’t displace fossil fuels but in fact supplement them====**
**Foster et al 10**
(John Bellamy, prof of sociology @ U of Oregon, Brett Clark, asst prof of sociology @ NC-State, Richard York, associate prof of sociology @ U of Oregon, The Ecological Rift, pgs. 183-191)

===1NC Not Cost Competitive (Solar)===


====Solar can~’t be cost competitive – Europe proves====
Kreutzer, PhD in economics 12, David Kreutzer has a PhD. in economics from George mason University, Senior Policy Analyst in Energy Economics and Climate Change at The Heritage Foundation, &amp;#34;Subsidies and Costs in the Solar Industry&amp;#34; 2-27-2012, http://blog.heritage.org/2012/02/27/subsidies-and-costs-in-the-solar-industry/)
It shouldn~’t be too much of a surprise that shares for solar-panel makers 
AND
the mistakes of others and put an end to subsidies for unaffordable energy.

====Plan fails – can~’t become cost competitive – ten reasons====
Empirics –billions of subsidies in squo haven~’t spurred
RPS~’s mean no collapse
Can~’t compete w/ nat gas
Fed/state investment increasing now
Europe proves
Unconcentrated energy content = too much land
Siting constraints
High cost of transmission
Low capacity factors/intermittency = need backup which = expensive
Not an infant industry, cost evidence proves
**Zycher**, Adjunct professor of Economics, **12** Benjamin Zycher, Adjunct professor of Economics and Business at CSU-Channel Islands, associate of the Office of Economic Analysis, Bureau of Intelligence and research in the US department of State.  Ph.D in economics from UCLA, senior fellow at pacific Research Institute, &amp;#34;Wind and solar power, part III: chasing the green tail&amp;#34;, 1-17-2012, http://www.aei.org/outlook/energy-and-the-environment/alternative-energy/wind-and-solar-power-part-iii-chasing-the-green-tail/)
Key points in this Outlook: Between billions of dollars worth of subsidies and support 
AND
the realities of this recent history provide a useful guide for policy reform.

====Decline doesn~’t cause war====
Daniel **Deudney**, Hewlett Fellow in Science, Technology, and Society at the Center for Energy and Environmental Studies at Princeton, April **1991**, &amp;#34;Environment and Security: Muddled Thinking&amp;#34;, Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, p. 27, google books,  

Poverty Wars.   In a second scenario, declining living standards first cause internal turmoil
AND
military operations require complex organizational skills, specialized industrial products and surplus wealth.

====Growth now makes war more likely—globalization is becoming militarized====
**Capie, prof IR, 11**—Senior Lecturer in International Relations at Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand, Visiting Scholar at the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs at Harvard University, Research Associate in the ASEAN Studies Centre at American University, co-editor of the journal Political Science, member of the editorial board of Asian Politics and Policy (David, 7/16/2011, &amp;#34;Welcome to the dark side? Mittelman~’s encounter with global insecurity&amp;#34;, Global Change, Peace %26 Security, Volume 23, Issue 2, Taylor and Francis, AL)
The book~’s thesis is that there are two systemic drivers of contemporary security and insecurity
AND
on globalization and peace and conflict to form a compelling and provocative account. 


====Complexity ensures inevitable collapse – sooner is better====
**Vail 5 **– Jeff Vail, attorney at Davis Graham %26 Stubbs LLP in Denver, Colorado specializing in litigation and energy issues, former intelligence officer with the US Air Force and energy infrastructure counterterrorism specialist with the US Department of the Interior, April 28, 2005, &amp;#34;The Logic of Collapse,&amp;#34; online: http://www.jeffvail.net/2005/04/logic-of-collapse.html-http://www.jeffvail.net/2005/04/logic-of-collapse.html

But despite the declining marginal returns, society is not capable of reducing expenditure, 
AND
that &amp;#34;this time, in our civilization, things will be different&amp;#34;?

==Food Wars==

====No scientific data to support drought-induced conflict theory**====
Buhaug et al**, Professor Centre for the Study of Civil War at Peace Research Institute Oslo, **~’12** (Halvard, Winter, &amp;#34;Climate Wars? Assessing the Claim That Drought Breeds Conflict&amp;#34; International Security, Vol 36 No 3, ProjectMuse)**
In his acceptance lecture on the occasion of the Nobel Peace Prize award, President 
AND
state plays in ending or fueling these conflicts. ~~End Page 106~~

===Resource scarcity doesn~’t cause conflict – newest robust studies prove===
Buhaug et al**, Professor Centre for the Study of Civil War at Peace Research Institute Oslo, **~’12** (Halvard, Winter, &amp;#34;Climate Wars? Assessing the Claim That Drought Breeds Conflict&amp;#34; International Security, Vol 36 No 3, ProjectMuse)**
The general expectation that failing precipitation could cause armed conflict draws on an influential body 
AND
most likely&amp;#34; scenario than what has been presented in earlier empirical research.

=Water Wars=

====Empirics disprove and no statistical date to support their claims – no risk of escalation====
Katz, Enviro Studies Prof at Tel Aviv, ~’11** (David, February, &amp;#34;Hydro-Political Hyperbole: Examining Incentives for Overemphasizing the Risks of Water Wars&amp;#34; Global Environmental Politics, Vol 11 No 1, ProjectMuse)**
Critiques of the Water War Hypothesis A number critiques have been leveled against both the
