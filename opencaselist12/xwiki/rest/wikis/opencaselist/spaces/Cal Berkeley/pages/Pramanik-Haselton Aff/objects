3) Counter Interpretation – 
a) Restriction means limitation or qualification
Mattice, US District Judge, 07 
(Wright v. Tenn. Bd. of Examiners in Psychology, 2004 Tenn. App. LEXIS 875)
In the instant case, the Court is required to interpret the word &amp;#34;restriction&amp;#34; as used by the parties in the Agreement. The parties apparently agree that the legal definition of restriction~-~-&amp;#34;a limitation or qualification,&amp;#34; Black&amp;#39;s Law Dictionary 1341 (8th ed. 1999)~-~-is a good place to start. Thus, the Court must determine whether the board&amp;#39;s supervision requirement falls within this definition.
b) That limitation has to be legally imposed – includes regulation
Gerald N. Hill and Kathleen T. Hill – 2005, the Free Dictionary, http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Restrictions
restriction n. any limitation on activity, by statute, regulation or contract provision. In multi-unit real estate developments, condominium and cooperative housing projects, managed by homeowners&amp;#39; associations or similar organizations are usually required by state law to impose restrictions on use. Thus, the restrictions are part of the &amp;#34;covenants, conditions and restrictions,&amp;#34; intended to enhance the use of common facilities and property, recorded and incorporated into the title of each owner.
