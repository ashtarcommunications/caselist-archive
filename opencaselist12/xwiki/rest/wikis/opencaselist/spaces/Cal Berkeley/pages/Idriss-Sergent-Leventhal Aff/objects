&#xD;
====—- Women====&#xD;
**Edwards-Levy, 8/31** (Ariel, 8/31/2012, &amp;#34;Female Voters Prefer Obama To Romney, Are Focused On Economy, Poll Says,&amp;#34; http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/30/female-voters-obama-romney-poll_n_1844312.html?1346360706)&#xD;
&#xD;
WASHINGTON — As women have found themselves in the center of much of 2012~’s political wrangling — their bodies a topic for debate, and their hearts and minds a top campaign priority — many are embracing their status as key voters, according to a poll released Thursday by Lifetime television.&#xD;
Female voters strongly favor President Barack Obama over GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, according to the survey, which was conducted by Republican pollster Kellyanne Conway of the polling company, inc./WomanTrend and Democratic pollster Celinda Lake of Lake Research Partners.&#xD;
&amp;#34;Both parties have women that they can appeal to,&amp;#34; Lake said. &amp;#34;Women are the key swing vote and will probably decide the election, but I think women are more self-conscious about the role. I think the really interesting part is that women are poised to take things into their own hands.&amp;#34;&#xD;
Obama received support from 52 percent of likely female voters, compared to 36 percent for Romney. That double-digit lead tracks with Obama~’s performance in 2008 exit polls, although it~’s a few points higher than Obama~’s lead among women in other recent polls.&#xD;
Half of the women polled said Obama deserved an &amp;#34;A&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;B&amp;#34; for his time in office, while 29 percent gave him a &amp;#34;D&amp;#34; or an &amp;#34;F.&amp;#34;&#xD;
Michelle Obama also fared well, with 72 percent of women viewing her favorably. Ann Romney, who exclaimed &amp;#34;I love you women%21&amp;#34; during her Wednesday convention speech, was far less well-known, with 30 percent viewing her favorably, and 45 percent saying they hadn~’t heard of her or had no opinion. The survey was conducted prior to the speech.&#xD;
As with the general electorate, women largely gave top priority to the economy and jobs. And although nine out of 10 women said it was important that a candidate understand women, even more prioritized an understanding of the middle class, with 94 percent calling it important.&#xD;
Many women have been turned off by the campaign~’s tendency to veer toward issues like abortion, Lake said. &amp;#34;Women want to know, why are we talking about this at all? Why aren~’t we focusing on the economy?&amp;#34;&#xD;
Four years after she lost the Democratic primary, Hillary Clinton retains strong support among women voters, with 60 percent of all women saying she should run again. Fifty-eight percent said they would definitely or probably vote for her. A third said she would have done better as president than Obama.&#xD;
Only 27 percent of women expressed concern that the nation never has had a female president, although a higher number — 45 percent — said the United States would be in better shape to face the future with a female leader. Nine in 10 said they would encourage the young women in their life to run for office; 8 percent said they were likely to run themselves.&#xD;
&amp;#34;There~’s been a gradual evolution of women as engaged voters ... They~’re no less &#xD;
AND&#xD;
about which they care, and you can~’t win if you don~’t play.&amp;#34;&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
====Single event won~’t swing the election====&#xD;
**Feldmann, 10/3** (Linda, 10/3/2012, &amp;#34;Why Mitt Romney trails in polls, as presidential debates begin,&amp;#34; http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/DC-Decoder/2012/1003/Why-Mitt-Romney-trails-in-polls-as-presidential-debates-begin-video-http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/DC-Decoder/2012/1003/Why-Mitt-Romney-trails-in-polls-as-presidential-debates-begin-video)&#xD;
&#xD;
Fully two-thirds of voters know that it was Romney who made the statement, and among those voters, 55 percent reacted negatively, versus 23 percent who saw it positively, according to Pew. Most damaging to Romney is the reaction of independent voters. Some 55 percent of independents who are aware of Romney~’s comment say they had a negative reaction to it, while only 18 percent viewed it positively.&#xD;
But Gallup asked voters if the 47 percent comment has made them more or less likely to vote for Romney, and a plurality said it made no difference.&#xD;
Indeed, analysts say it~’s nearly impossible to isolate an individual event or comment as being decisive in turning a race.&#xD;
&amp;#34;Voters are confronting a big wide Mississippi River of information flowing at them, and as a consequence it~’s difficult to isolate the effect of any one thing,&amp;#34; says John Sides, an associate professor of political science at George Washington University in Washington. &amp;#34;That said, there~’s no question it~’s been several weeks of relatively bad news for the Romney campaign. It hasn~’t enabled him to close the post-convention gap. If anything, that gap has grown.&amp;#34;&#xD;
&#xD;
====Winning allows Obama to build momentum and swing the reverse the tide====&#xD;
**Creamer, 11** —- long-time political organizer and strategist (12/23/2011, Robert, &amp;#34;Why GOP Collapse on the Payroll Tax Could Be a Turning Point Moment,&amp;#34; http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-creamer/gop-payroll-tax_b_1167491.html)&#xD;
&#xD;
The outcome of the battle was unambiguous. No one could doubt who stood up for the economic interests of the middle class and who did not. And no one could doubt who won and who lost.&#xD;
National Journal reported that, &amp;#34;House Republicans on Thursday crumpled under the weight of White House and public pressure and have agreed to pass a two-month extension of the two percent payroll-tax cut, Republican and Democratic sources told National Journal.&amp;#34;&#xD;
In the end, Republican intransigence transformed a moment that would have been a modest win for President Obama into an iconic victory.&#xD;
2) Strength and victory are enormous political assets. Going into the New Year, they now belong to the president and the Democrats.&#xD;
One of the reasons why the debt ceiling battle inflicted political damage on President Obama is that it made him appear ineffectual — a powerful figure who had been ensnared and held hostage by the Lilliputian pettiness of hundreds of swarming Tea Party ideological zealots.&#xD;
In the last few months — as he campaigned for the American Jobs Act — he has shaken free of those bonds. Now voters have just watched James Bond or Indiana Jones escape and turn the tables on his adversary.&#xD;
Great stories are about a protagonist who meets and overcomes a challenge and is victorious. The capitulation of the House Tea Party Republicans is so important because it feels like the beginning of that kind of heroic narrative.&#xD;
Even today most Americans believe that George Bush and the big Wall Street banks — not by President Obama — caused the economic crisis. Swing voters have never lost their fondness for the President and don~’t doubt his sincerity. But they had begun to doubt his effectiveness. They have had increasing doubts that Obama was up to the challenge of leading them back to economic prosperity.&#xD;
The narrative set in motion by the events of the last several weeks could be a turning point in voter perception. It could well begin to convince skeptical voters that Obama is precisely the kind of leader they thought he was back in 2008 — a guy with the ability to lead them out of adversity — a leader with the strength, patience, skill, will and resoluteness to lead them to victory.&#xD;
That now contrasts with the sheer political incompetence of the House Republican leadership that allowed themselves to be cornered and now find themselves in political disarray. And it certainly contrasts with the political circus we have been watching in the Republican Presidential primary campaign.&#xD;
3) This victory will inspire the dispirited Democratic base.&#xD;
Inspiration is the feeling of empowerment — the feeling that you are part of something larger than yourself and can personally play a significant role in achieving that goal. It comes from feeling that together you can overcome challenges and win.&#xD;
Nothing will do more to inspire committed Democrats than the sight of their leader — President Obama — out-maneuvering the House Republicans &#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
and forcing them into complete capitulation.&#xD;
The events of the last several weeks will send a jolt of electricity through the progressive community.&#xD;
The right is counting on progressives to be demoralized and dispirited in the coming election. The president~’s victory on the payroll tax and unemployment will make it ever more likely that they will be wrong.&#xD;
4) When you have them on the run, that~’s the time to chase them.&#xD;
The most important thing about the outcome of the battle over the payroll tax and unemployment is that it shifts the political momentum at a critical time. Momentum is an independent variable in any competitive activity — including politics.&#xD;
In a football or basketball game you can feel the momentum shift. The tide of battle is all about momentum. The same is true in politics. And in politics it is even more important because the &amp;#34;spectators&amp;#34; are also the players — the voters.&#xD;
People follow — and vote — for winners. The bandwagon effect is enormously important in political decision-making. Human beings like to travel in packs. They like to be at the center of the mainstream. Momentum shifts affect their perceptions of the mainstream.&#xD;
For the last two years, the right wing has been on the offensive. Its Tea Party shock troops took the battle to Democratic members of Congress. In the mid-terms Democrats were routed in district after district.&#xD;
Now the tide has turned. And when the tide turns — when you have them on the run — that~’s the time to chase them.&#xD;
We won~’t know for sure until next November whether this moment will take on the same iconic importance as Clinton~’s battle with Gingrich in 1995. But there is no doubt that the political wind has shifted. It~’s up to progressives to make the most of it.&#xD;
&#xD;
====No link – Obama avoids crises====&#xD;
**Rogers, 9/17** (Ed, 9/17/2012, &amp;#34;Obama~’s 21st-century Teflon is working,&amp;#34; http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-insiders/post/obamas-21st-century-teflon-is-working/2012/09/17/82b05da8-00bf-11e2-bbf0-e33b4ee2f0e8_blog.html?wprss=rss_opinions-http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-insiders/post/obamas-21st-century-teflon-is-working/2012/09/17/82b05da8-00bf-11e2-bbf0-e33b4ee2f0e8_blog.html?wprss=rss_opinions )&#xD;
 &#xD;
It is safe to say that America~’s outreach to the world under President Obama has been a complete failure. Does America enjoy more or less respect than it did four years ago? If you think more, please let me know where.&#xD;
Last weekend was the end of Obama~’s foreign policy. Diplomats are being called in and troops are being sent out — at least to where our enemies will allow them. The likes of Sudan know they can refuse Obama~’s wish for more troops to protect our embassies. Obama will probably tell us the Sudanese promise to provide adequate protection for Americans was a hard-fought concession.&#xD;
Anyway, for the first time since the 2012 campaign began, Obama might want to talk about the economy. The images of the fires burning and the angry crowds on the Arab streets all underscore the complete failure of Obama~’s foreign policy, reminding us of his naivete and the price we pay for his on-the-job-training. Remember, this is a man who thought he was worthy of the Nobel Peace Prize just for being who he was.&#xD;
The planet would heal because of his desire for it to do so. His very presence meant tension in the Middle East would subside.  And why not? He had some new ideas: Remember his instructions to his NASA administrator that there was no higher priority than to make Arabs feel better about themselves? &#xD;
With the world mostly either disrespecting America or just sadly shaking its head and wondering where America has gone, perhaps the Obama campaign could use a few days of blaming George W. Bush for the Obama administration~’s economic failures.&#xD;
Foreign policy can~’t win elections, but it can lose them. Obama is pushing &#xD;
AND&#xD;
and generate the jobs that Obama~’s policies haven~’t — and won~’t — deliver.  &#xD;
So as the campaign heads for the debates, voters must be asking themselves what &#xD;
AND&#xD;
century coat of Teflon that makes Reagan~’s legendary resilience look small-time.&#xD;

====Election outcome not key to relations —- they will inevitably decline====&#xD;
**Bovt, 9/12** —- political analyst (9/12/2012, &amp;#34;Whether Obama or Romney, the Reset Is Dead,&amp;#34; http://www.themoscowtimes.com/opinion/article/whether-obama-or-romney-the-reset-is-dead/467947.html-http://www.themoscowtimes.com/opinion/article/whether-obama-or-romney-the-reset-is-dead/467947.html )&#xD;
&#xD;
During every U.S. presidential election campaign, there is a debate in Russia over whether the Republican or Democratic candidate would be more beneficial for the Kremlin. Russian analysts and politicians always fail to understand that Americans have shown little interest in foreign policy since the end of the Cold War. Even when foreign policy is mentioned in the campaign, Russia is far down the list as a priority item.&#xD;
The volume of U.S-Russian trade remains small. The recent Exxon-Rosneft deal notwithstanding, U.S. interest in Russia~’s energy projects has fallen, particularly as the Kremlin has increased its role in this sector. To make matters worse, the United States is determined to establish clean energy and energy independence, while Russia~’s gas exports are feeling the pinch from stiff competition with the U.S. development of shale gas production.&#xD;
Of course, traditional areas of cooperation remain: the transit of shipments to and from Afghanistan through Russia, Iran~’s nuclear program and the struggle against international terrorism. But the transit route into Afghanistan cannot, by itself, greatly influence bilateral relations as a whole, and progress on the other two points seems to have reached a plateau beyond which little potential remains for bringing the two countries into closer cooperation.&#xD;
On the positive side, a new visa agreement came into force this week that will facilitate greater contact between both countries~’ citizens. But it will be years before that significantly influences overall U.S.-Russian relations. A new agreement regarding child adoptions has also been implemented after a few disturbing adoption stories prompted Russia~’s media, with the help of government propaganda, to spoil the U.S. image in Russia.&#xD;
Meanwhile, both U.S. President Barack Obama and Republican candidate Mitt Romney &#xD;
AND&#xD;
Democratic or Republican — will ever agree to major concessions on missile defense.&#xD;
It even seemed that Kremlin propagandists were happy when in March Romney called Russia the United States~’ No. 1 foe. They were given another present when Obama, addressing the Democratic National Convention last week, said Romney~’s comment only proved that he lacked foreign policy experience and was locked in Cold War thinking. For the next two months, however, the two candidates are unlikely to devote much attention to Russia.&#xD;
Russia~’s internal politics will also be one of the key factors shaping future U.S.-Russian relations. The two-year jail sentence slapped on three members of Pussy Riot for their anti-Putin prayer in Moscow~’s main cathedral has already become a subject of discussion between Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Even the most pragmatic &amp;#34;pro-reset&amp;#34; U.S. administration would criticize to one degree or another Russia~’s poor record on human rights.&#xD;
It appears that Russia is moving increasingly toward confrontation rather than rapprochement with the West. The Kremlin now seems fully committed to spreading the myth that the U.S. State Department is the cause behind most of Russia~’s domestic problems and is bent on undermining its national security by deploying missile defense installations in Europe and by supporting the opposition.&#xD;
There are other disturbing signals as well. Take, for example, the United &#xD;
AND&#xD;
blackmail Russian officials by threatening to freeze their overseas bank accounts and property.&#xD;
An increase in these anti-Western attitudes does not bode well for U.&#xD;
AND&#xD;
from both sides would itself be considered a major achievement in bilateral relations.&#xD;

DOD has also joined with private sector entities, entering into various types of arrangements

several different types of these approaches that have resulted in renewable energy projects.

====DOD renewable energy fails – costs too much, fails as backup energy====
**Sater 2011** - Research Fellow at Global Green USA~’s Security and Sustainability Office in Washington, DC (August, Daniel, &amp;#34;Military Energy Security: Current Efforts and Future Solutions&amp;#34; http://globalgreen.org/docs/publication-185-1.pdf)

The DOD~’s efforts to increase renewable energy usage raise three key issues: cost, 
AND
projects but &amp;#34;to a level commensurate with their operational and financial value&amp;#34;.
41 The heavy focus on renewable energy generation, as a result of ECIP regulations and the Energy Policy Act of 2005, crowds out other projects that would be more cost efficient and lower the DOD~’s energy usage to a greater degree. Furthermore, renewable energy sources, due to their non-continuous flow of electricity, are unsuitable as backup sources of power, though the implementation of a smart microgrid can mitigate this problem.

This poor competitive performance of wind and solar energy is not limited to the United 
AND
for slow growth at best, notwithstanding large subsidies and other policy support.
This market resistance to investment in renewable generation capacity can be explained by the problems intrinsic to renewable power—that is, the inherent limitations on its competitiveness—that public policies can circumvent or neutralize only at very substantial cost. Those problems can be summarized as:
unconcentrated energy content;
siting constraints and resulting high costs for transmission; and 
the costs created by low capacity factors, the intermittent nature of wind flows and sunlight, and the resulting need for backup capacity.
