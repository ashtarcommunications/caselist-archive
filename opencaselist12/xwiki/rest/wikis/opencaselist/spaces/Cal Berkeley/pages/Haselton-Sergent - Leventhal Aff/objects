We~’ve assumed throughout this election cycle that the economy and jobs would drive voter choice, but that would mean a referendum on the current incumbent, something Democrats desperately wanted to avoid.  Two weeks ago, Democrats promised us that they would make foreign policy the focus of the election.  As I note in my column for The Week, that didn~’t come from low-level party functionaries, but from the prime-time speakers — including Barack Obama himself:
    Ironically, Democrats had promised a fight on foreign policy just a week earlier
AND
, and a transparent attempt to deflect the election away from the economy.
As an old axiom warns, be careful what you wish for — you just 
AND
a stark indicator of just how badly Obama has failed on this front:
    What lessons can be learned from events in Libya? That nothing good will come out of the Arab Spring? That Arabs are volatile, easily excitable and prone to acting out? That the United States, Mitt Romney notwithstanding, cannot control everything or that the United States, Mitt Romney more to the point, has tried to control nothing? In other words, is this what happens when the United States is &amp;#34;leading from behind&amp;#34;?
    This phrase, you might remember, was coined in reference to Barack Obama~’s 
AND
. Benghazi was saved from Gaddafi~’s bloody reprisals, but not from mayhem.
    The notion that the United States can lead from behind is pitiful, the 
AND
left to fend for itself. It has not fended all that well.
Cohen predictably rips Romney for pointing this out, but concludes that Romney is very much right about Obama~’s foreign policy of passivity:
    Romney was wrong and ham-fisted and alarmingly premature to criticize Obama for 
AND
behind is not a nifty phrase. In Libya, it~’s an indictment.
Michael Ramirez distills the lessons from a week of making the Obama foreign-policy expertise the center of attention:
But will this become a foreign-policy election?  In my column, I argue no — at least not for now — but that it might end up backfiring on Obama anyway:
    By Monday, the Washington Post reported that the Obama campaign would shift its focus to the economy, a stark about-face from just a fortnight earlier in Charlotte, N.C.
    Have events changed the nature of the election from a focus primarily on domestic 
AND
create the kind of narrative that made Carter a one-term president.
In short, the argument for an economy-based election always relied on making 
AND
the White House and State missed opportunities to prevent what happened in Benghazi.

New Jersey-based Monmouth University released a new poll of the presidential race yesterday showing President Obama leading 48 percent to 41 percent among registered voters and 48 percent to 45 percent over Mitt Romney among likely voters. Unskewing this poll leads to a result showing Romney leading with a 46 percent to 45 percent margin over President Obama with registered voters, and likewise a 50 percent to 45 perfect Romney lead among likely voters.
The QStarNews Quick Poll of the presidential race released yesterday shows Mitt Romney with a

The latest New York Times/CBS News poll of the presidential race released recently is yet another doctored poll that shows President Obama leading when its data indicates a Mitt Romney lead. The survey of 1170 registered voters, polled between September 8-12, has Obama leading over Romney by a 49 percent to 46 percent margin. Unskewing the data indicates a Romney lead over Obama by 51 percent to 44 percent.
The new Democracy Corps survey of the presidential race released recently shows President Obama leading

Obama by a 52 percent to 43 percent with about five percent undecided.
The Fox News poll released today continues the trend of skewed polls that over-

The Romney camp dismisses most of the recent polling as a &amp;#34;sugar high&amp;#34; for Mr. Obama left over from the party conventions. &amp;#34;Polls are going to go this way and that way,&amp;#34; Mr. Romney~’s running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan, told donors during a fundraiser Thursday night in Washington. &amp;#34;But at the end of the day, if we do our jobs right, and we will, the country will have a really clear choice.&amp;#34;
Among other factors, Romney supporters point to polling that shows Republicans hold a modest edge in voter enthusiasm and data that shows a large percentage of Americans still think the country is moving in the wrong direction. &amp;#34;We feel like we~’re in a very close contest,&amp;#34; said Ed Gillespie, a senior adviser to the Romney campaign. &amp;#34;We feel like Romney is likely to win.&amp;#34;

It is safe to say that America~’s outreach to the world under President Obama has been a complete failure. Does America enjoy more or less respect than it did four years ago? If you think more, please let me know where.
Last weekend was the end of Obama~’s foreign policy. Diplomats are being called in and troops are being sent out — at least to where our enemies will allow them. The likes of Sudan know they can refuse Obama~’s wish for more troops to protect our embassies. Obama will probably tell us the Sudanese promise to provide adequate protection for Americans was a hard-fought concession.
Anyway, for the first time since the 2012 campaign began, Obama might want to talk about the economy. The images of the fires burning and the angry crowds on the Arab streets all underscore the complete failure of Obama~’s foreign policy, reminding us of his naivete and the price we pay for his on-the-job-training. Remember, this is a man who thought he was worthy of the Nobel Peace Prize just for being who he was.
The planet would heal because of his desire for it to do so. His very presence meant tension in the Middle East would subside.  And why not? He had some new ideas: Remember his instructions to his NASA administrator that there was no higher priority than to make Arabs feel better about themselves? 
With the world mostly either disrespecting America or just sadly shaking its head and wondering where America has gone, perhaps the Obama campaign could use a few days of blaming George W. Bush for the Obama administration~’s economic failures.
Foreign policy can~’t win elections, but it can lose them. Obama is pushing 
AND
and generate the jobs that Obama~’s policies haven~’t — and won~’t — deliver.  
So as the campaign heads for the debates, voters must be asking themselves what 
AND
century coat of Teflon that makes Reagan~’s legendary resilience look small-time.

A second difficulty is that if Bender is correct that the centeredness of human consciousness predisposes (or just is) chauvinistic, then either we really are doomed to continue the ecocidal trajectory of our history or, as Bender argues, we must disavow our human-centeredness 

in favor of an ecocentric (&amp;#34;non-dualist&amp;#34;) perspective and practice (2003

Second, then, is that however indigenous, no necessary implications for ethnicity,

====Obama will lose —- no President has won when trailing at this point====
**Stoddard, 10/18** —- associate editor of The Hill (10/18/2012, A.B., &amp;#34;Obama spinning toward a loss,&amp;#34; 
http://thehill.com/opinion/columnists/ab-stoddard/262925-obama-spinning-toward-a-loss)

President Obama is losing. So says the latest Gallup poll, and so do those swelling numbers in key states like Wisconsin, Florida, Virginia and Ohio.
Democrats say wait, he won the second debate. They are holding their breath
AND
(see Mitt Romney: Gallup) has ever gone on to lose.
Perhaps Obama lost the presidency weeks ago, on Oct. 3, when he 
AND
the sale for anyone who still cannot make up his or her mind.
Romney is arguing Obama has still failed to articulate a reason, plan or purpose for a second term. He is correct. But Obama has indeed, late in the game, come up with a more forceful defense of his first term, and an argument about the economy growing from the middle out instead of the top down.
In addition, Democrats finally did their research and came up with some embarrassing changes in policy positions by Romney to debut at the debates and are cutting new flip-flop ads around the clock. Stunned by the loss of female support the Romney debate surge has cost him, Obama is focusing intently on shoring up the votes of suburban women and giving them binders full of reasons not to buy what Romney is selling.
Romney too is running new ads about his abortion flexibility, his support for contraception 
AND
he compiled to locate qualified women for his Cabinet as governor of Massachusetts.
Indeed, though President Obama was deemed the debate winner by numerous snap polls this week, the polls show just how firm Romney~’s support has grown. In every poll he beat Obama by a wide margin on who is stronger on the economy.
Obama can expect, even if he wins another debate on Oct. 22, 
AND
three weeks to go it~’s hard to see where he finds that excitement.

====Energy decisions won~’t swing votes====

Energy Falls in Importance
Energy emerged as a major issue during the 2008 campaign. In August, as gas prices surged, 77% of voters said the issue of energy would be very important to their vote. Currently, just 55% view energy as very important.
Just 52% of Republican voters now say energy is very important, down from 74% four years ago when the phrase &amp;#34;drill baby drill&amp;#34; became a political slogan at the 2008 GOP convention. The declines have been comparable among independents (25 points) and Democrats (20 points).


====Single event won~’t swing the election====
**Feldmann, 10/3** (Linda, 10/3/2012, &amp;#34;Why Mitt Romney trails in polls, as presidential debates begin,&amp;#34; http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/DC-Decoder/2012/1003/Why-Mitt-Romney-trails-in-polls-as-presidential-debates-begin-video-http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/DC-Decoder/2012/1003/Why-Mitt-Romney-trails-in-polls-as-presidential-debates-begin-video)

Fully two-thirds of voters know that it was Romney who made the statement, and among those voters, 55 percent reacted negatively, versus 23 percent who saw it positively, according to Pew. Most damaging to Romney is the reaction of independent voters. Some 55 percent of independents who are aware of Romney~’s comment say they had a negative reaction to it, while only 18 percent viewed it positively.
But Gallup asked voters if the 47 percent comment has made them more or less likely to vote for Romney, and a plurality said it made no difference.
Indeed, analysts say it~’s nearly impossible to isolate an individual event or comment as being decisive in turning a race.
&amp;#34;Voters are confronting a big wide Mississippi River of information flowing at them, and as a consequence it~’s difficult to isolate the effect of any one thing,&amp;#34; says John Sides, an associate professor of political science at George Washington University in Washington. &amp;#34;That said, there~’s no question it~’s been several weeks of relatively bad news for the Romney campaign. It hasn~’t enabled him to close the post-convention gap. If anything, that gap has grown.&amp;#34;

====No link – Obama avoids crises====
**Rogers, 9/17** (Ed, 9/17/2012, &amp;#34;Obama~’s 21st-century Teflon is working,&amp;#34; http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-insiders/post/obamas-21st-century-teflon-is-working/2012/09/17/82b05da8-00bf-11e2-bbf0-e33b4ee2f0e8_blog.html?wprss=rss_opinions-http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-insiders/post/obamas-21st-century-teflon-is-working/2012/09/17/82b05da8-00bf-11e2-bbf0-e33b4ee2f0e8_blog.html?wprss=rss_opinions )
 
It is safe to say that America~’s outreach to the world under President Obama has been a complete failure. Does America enjoy more or less respect than it did four years ago? If you think more, please let me know where.
Last weekend was the end of Obama~’s foreign policy. Diplomats are being called in and troops are being sent out — at least to where our enemies will allow them. The likes of Sudan know they can refuse Obama~’s wish for more troops to protect our embassies. Obama will probably tell us the Sudanese promise to provide adequate protection for Americans was a hard-fought concession.
Anyway, for the first time since the 2012 campaign began, Obama might want to talk about the economy. The images of the fires burning and the angry crowds on the Arab streets all underscore the complete failure of Obama~’s foreign policy, reminding us of his naivete and the price we pay for his on-the-job-training. Remember, this is a man who thought he was worthy of the Nobel Peace Prize just for being who he was.
The planet would heal because of his desire for it to do so. His very presence meant tension in the Middle East would subside.  And why not? He had some new ideas: Remember his instructions to his NASA administrator that there was no higher priority than to make Arabs feel better about themselves? 
With the world mostly either disrespecting America or just sadly shaking its head and wondering where America has gone, perhaps the Obama campaign could use a few days of blaming George W. Bush for the Obama administration~’s economic failures.
Foreign policy can~’t win elections, but it can lose them. Obama is pushing 
AND
and generate the jobs that Obama~’s policies haven~’t — and won~’t — deliver.  
So as the campaign heads for the debates, voters must be asking themselves what 
AND
century coat of Teflon that makes Reagan~’s legendary resilience look small-time.

In an interview that aired on ABC~’s Good Morning America on Friday, MItt Romney said that his &amp;#34;red line&amp;#34; on Iran — the point that would trigger a U.S. military response to Iran~’s nuclear program — is the same as President Obama~’s, despite a Romney adviser~’s assertion that Iran represents &amp;#34;the sharpest foreign policy difference&amp;#34; between the two candidates.
After Romney told ABC~’s George Stephanopoulos that his &amp;#34;red line&amp;#34; on Iran is that the Islamic Republic &amp;#34;may not have a nuclear weapon,&amp;#34; the host pointed out that his policy is the same as Obama~’s. The GOP presidential nominee agreed:
    STEPHANOPOULOS: President Obama said exactly the same thing. He said it~’s unacceptable for Iran to have a nuclear weapon. So your red line is the same as his.
    ROMNEY: Yeah, and I laid out what I would do to keep Iran from reaching that red line. ~~...~~
    STEPHANOPOULOS: But your red line going forward is the same?
    ROMNEY: Yes. And recognize that when one says that it~’s unacceptable to the United States of America that that means what it says. You~’ll take any action necessary to prevent that development, which is Iran becoming nuclear.
Watch the clip:
Romney~’s statement illustrates the confusion from Romney~’s team on Iran, and indeed on the Romney camp~’s wider foreign policy. (Romney~’s foreign policy director would neither confirm nor deny that Romney is a neoconservative.) On one hand, the Romney campaign struggles to differentiate its Iran policy from President Obama~’s, and on the other, his team sounds more like a neocon revival committee pushing for another war in the Middle East.
The New York Times noticed this contradiction as well, reporting in an article on Friday that a senior foreign policy adviser to Romney said the former Massachusetts governor &amp;#34;would not be content with an Iran one screwdriver~’s turn away from a nuclear weapon.&amp;#34; But, the Times added, the adviser &amp;#34;stopped short of saying exactly where, in the development of nuclear capability, Mr. Romney would draw the line.&amp;#34;
President Obama has said that he won~’t allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon. 
AND
the &amp;#34;best and most permanent way&amp;#34; to solve the nuclear crisis.


====No significant foreign policy differences between Obama and Romney====
**Smith, 10/6 **—- former editor of the (U.S.) Guardian Newsweekl (Jack A., &amp;#34;Obama and Romney: Similar Views on Foreign/Military Policy,&amp;#34; 10/6/2012 http://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/2012/10/06/obama-and-romney-similar-views-on-foreignmilitary-policy/-http://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/2012/10/06/obama-and-romney-similar-views-on-foreignmilitary-policy/)

Despite the sharp charges and counter-charges about foreign/military and national security policy, there are no important differences on such matters between President Barack Obama and challenger Mitt Romney. The back and forth between the candidates on international issues is largely about appearance, not substance.
The Washington Post noted on Sept. 26 that the two candidates &amp;#34;made clear this week that they share an overriding belief — American political and economic values should triumph in the world.&amp;#34; Add to that uplifting phrase the implicit words &amp;#34;by any means necessary,&amp;#34; and you have the essence of Washington~’s international endeavors.
There are significant differences within the GOP~’s right wing factions — from neoconservatives and ultra nationalists to libertarians and traditional foreign policy pragmatic realists — that make it extremely difficult for the Republicans to articulate a comprehensive foreign/military policy. This is why Romney confines himself to criticizing Obama~’s international record without elaborating on his own perspective, except to imply he would do everything better than the incumbent.
Only nuances divide the two ruling parties on the principal strategic international objectives that determine the development of policy. Washington~’s main goals include:
• Retaining worldwide &amp;#34;leadership,&amp;#34; a euphemism for geopolitical hegemony.
• Maintaining the unparalleled military power required to crush any other country, using all means from drones to nuclear weapons. This is made clear in the incumbent administration~’s 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), the 2010 Nuclear Posture Review (NPR), and the January 2012 strategic defense guidance titled, &amp;#34;Sustaining U.S. Global Leadership: Priorities for 21st Century Defense.&amp;#34;
• Containing the rise of China~’s power and influence, not only globally but within 
AND
fleets, air bases, troops and treaties in place for the celebration.
• Exercising decisive authority over the entire resource-rich Middle East and adjacent North Africa. Only The Iranian and Syrian governments remain to be toppled. (Shia Iraq, too, if it gets too close to Iran.)
• Provoking regime change in Iran through crippling sanctions intended to wreck the country~’s economy and, with Israel, threats of war. There is no proof Iran is constructing a nuclear weapon.
• Seeking regime change in Syria, Shia Iran~’s (and Russia~’s) principal Arab ally. Obama is giving political and material support to fractious rebel forces in the civil war who are also supported by Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Turkey. The U.S. interest is in controlling the replacement regime.
• Weakening and isolating Russia as it develops closer economic and political ties to China, and particularly when it expresses opposition to certain of Washington~’s less savory schemes, such as continuing to expand NATO, seeking to crush Iran and Syria, and erecting anti-missile systems in Europe. In 20 years, NATO has been extended from Europe to Central Asia, adjacent to China and former Soviet republics.
• Continuing the over 50-year Cold War economic embargo, sanctions and various acts of subversion against Cuba in hopes of destroying socialism in that Caribbean Island nation.
• Recovering at least enough hegemony throughout Latin America — nearly all of which the U.S. dominated until perhaps 15 years ago — to undermine or remove left wing governments in Venezuela, Bolivia and Ecuador.
• Significantly increasing U.S. military engagement in Africa.
Both the right/far right Republican Party and the center right Democratic Party agree on these goals, although their language to describe them is always decorated with inspiring rhetoric about the triumph of American political and economic values; about spreading democracy and good feeling; about protecting the American people from terrorism and danger.
Today~’s foreign/military policy goals are contemporary adaptations of a consistent, bipartisan international perspective that began to take shape at the end of World War II in 1945. Since the implosion of the Soviet Union ended the 45-year Cold War two decades ago — leaving the U.S. and its imperialist ambitions as the single world superpower — Washington protects its role as &amp;#34;unipolar&amp;#34; hegemon like a hungry dog with a meaty bone.
The people of the United States have no influence over the fundamentals of Washington~’s foreign/military objectives. Many Americans seem to have no idea about Washington~’s actual goals. As far as a large number of voters are concerned the big foreign/military policy/national security issues in the election boil down to Iran~’s dangerous nuclear weapon; the need to stand up for Israel; stopping China from &amp;#34;stealing&amp;#34; American jobs; and preventing a terrorist attack on America.
One reason is the ignorance of a large portion of voters about past and present history and foreign affairs. Another is that many people still entertain the deeply flawed myths about &amp;#34;American exceptionalism&amp;#34; and the &amp;#34;American Century.&amp;#34; Lastly, there~’s round-the-clock government and mass media misinformation.

**Barno, et. al, 11/7** —- work at the Center for a New American Security Lieutenant General (Ret.) David W.

Scenario 3: Congress and the president fail to reach any agreement, and the nation goes off the fiscal cliff.
Continued gridlock during the lame duck session remains a high probability, and budget talks will likely involve a significant amount of brinksmanship among negotiators trying to maximize their own gains — brinksmanship that could well end in failure, preventing a deal and driving the nation off the fiscal cliff.
As noted above, the tight legislative calendar in the lame duck session and the 
AND
the possibility of delay remove the time pressure needed to reach a bargain.
Although President Obama has strongly opposed sequestration as a way to reduce the deficit, 
AND
the other hand, have demonstrated their equally strong opposition to new taxes.
Some legislators from both parties might see advantage in letting the nation go off the 
AND
with Republicans — taxes would rise significantly and defense spending would be cut.
In a perverse twist of logic, both parties might benefit from the new baselines 
AND
may be willing to vote to &amp;#34;increase&amp;#34; spending on defense programs.


====Bipartisanship on fiscal cliff will evaporate —- Boehner empirically can~’t reign in Tea Party members====
**The Guardian, 11/10** (Ewen MacAskill, 11/10/2012, &amp;#34;Obama statement: Back to reality as fiscal cliff approaches,&amp;#34; Factiva)

But any bipartisan spirit might prove short-lived. Boehner also went on to say that, unlike Obama and the Democrats, he does not favour raising taxes on the wealthy and that removing some loopholes and cleaning up the tax code would be enough to do the trick. He also expressed opposition to raising taxes on the wealthy.
Part of Boehner~’s problem is that so far he has not been able to control all his colleagues, particularly those elected with Tea Party support.
Ominously, in his first answer to a reporter, he was less than truthful, saying: &amp;#34;When the president and I have been able to come an agreement, there has been no problem in getting it passed in the House.&amp;#34;
Boehner and Obama reached an agreement on a &amp;#34;grand bargain&amp;#34; to resolve the fiscal cliff crisis last year but when Boehner took it back to his colleagues in the House they, led by the House majority leader Eric Cantor, blocked it.

Wind Fight Reaches Homestretch
After simmering for the better part of this year, the battle over the wind

against the wind policy say it~’s likely to be included in that deal.
Supporters of the policy are planning rallies and floor speeches the week of Nov. 13—the first week Congress is back after the election—to encourage members to extend the tax credit. Key lawmakers supporting the PTC include Sens. Mark Udall, D-Colo., and Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, as well as the House Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition chaired by Democratic Reps. Steve Israel and Paul Tonko of New York and Gerald Connolly of Virginia.
The policymakers leading the charge against the tax credit—Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., and Rep. Mike Pompeo, R-Kan.—will be helped by lobbyists working with nuclear-power giant Exelon, who assert that the credit is distorting electricity markets, and tea party groups that are seeking to eliminate most government subsidies.

In the next two months, the Environmental Protection Agency will likely move forward with

legal agreement with environmental groups to issue this standard by Dec. 14. 


====No immediate economic impact if we go over the cliff —- will still be time to resolve it and economic harms will force GOP to cave====
**Krugman, 11/10** (Paul, 11/10/2012, International Herald Tribune, &amp;#34;Hang tough, Mr. President,&amp;#34; Factiva)

Mr. Obama essentially surrendered in the face of similar tactics at the end of 2010, extending low taxes on the rich for two more years. He made significant concessions again in 2011, when Republicans threatened to create financial chaos by refusing to raise the debt ceiling. And the current potential crisis is the legacy of those past concessions.
Well, this has to stop — unless we want hostage-taking, the threat of making the nation ungovernable, to become a standard part of our political process.
So what should he do? Just say no, and go over the cliff if necessary.
It~’s worth pointing out that the fiscal cliff isn~’t really a cliff. It~’s not like the debt-ceiling confrontation, where terrible things might well have happened right away if the deadline had been missed. This time, nothing very bad will happen to the economy if agreement isn~’t reached until a few weeks or even a few months into 2013. So there~’s time to bargain.
More important, however, is the point that a stalemate would hurt Republican backers, corporate donors in particular, every bit as much as it hurt the rest of the country. As the risk of severe economic damage grew, Republicans would face intense pressure to cut a deal after all.
Meanwhile, the president is in a far stronger position than in previous confrontations. 
AND
a last-ditch attempt to defend the privileges of the 1 percent.
Most of all, standing up to hostage-taking is the right thing to do for the health of America~’s political system.
So stand your ground, Mr. President, and don~’t give in to threats. No deal is better than a bad deal.


====Their impact is hype —- won~’t be lasting damage to the economy or national security====

***
If we do go off the fiscal cliff, all is not lost for the Pentagon. The exact effects of allowing sequestration to take effect still remain unclear, but they are likely to occur more gradually than generally understood. Sequestration mandates a %2452.3 billion reduction of DOD spending in Fiscal Year (FY) 2013, which amounts to a 9.4 percent cut of budget authority from nonexempt accounts during the nine remaining months of FY 2013.
Focusing on the %2452.3 billion cut to defense budget authority distorts how sequestration would affect defense spending for the rest of the fiscal year. Budget authority is often spread across multiple years and therefore is an improper metric for examining the immediate impacts of cuts in economic terms. Instead, outlays — money actually spent — provide a better measure.
Some of the key ways that sequestration could affect defense during the rest of FY 2013 include:
    The DOD civilian workforce. As spending on civilian personnel is largely consumed in the first outlay year, the civilian workforce potentially faces significant layoffs or furloughs. Unlike uniformed personnel, civilian personnel are not exempt from sequestration. Expert analysts have estimated that if sequestration goes into effect, DOD would need to reduce its civilian workforce by as much as 13.7 percent during the remainder of the fiscal year.
    Military health care. Military health care services are subject to sequestration since they are primarily funded through nonexempt operations and maintenance accounts. This could result in delayed payments to providers and possible denial of services.
    Program cancellations. Despite widespread concern, most procurement programs will not be affected right away. Sequestration does not affect prior-year funding obligations, so already authorized and planned purchases will go ahead as scheduled. Sequestration allows already planned programs to continue, but over time it would reduce quantities bought, delay deliveries, and increase unit prices.
    Military end strength. Since President Obama exercised his authority to shield military personnel accounts from sequestration, pay and benefits would remain intact and end strength would not be cut beyond already-planned levels for FY 2013.
The Pentagon would likely try to mitigate some of these effects by asking Congress for 
AND
priorities, such as the Overseas Contingency Operations budget that supports deployed troops.
The Defense Department might also mitigate these effects by deferring any cuts until the fourth 
AND
have some political benefits — but that doesn~’t mean the risks aren~’t significant.

====political capital doesn~’t influence the passage of legislation – ~~issue are compartmentalized and presidential influence is exaggerated by the media~~====
Dickinson, 09 – professor of political science at Middlebury College and taught previously at Harvard University where he worked under the supervision of presidential scholar Richard Neustadt (5/26/09, Matthew, Presidential Power: A NonPartisan Analysis of Presidential Politics, &amp;#34;Sotomayor, Obama and Presidential Power,&amp;#34; http://blogs.middlebury.edu/presidentialpower/2009/05/26/sotamayor-obama-and-presidential-power/, JMP)

As for Sotomayor, from here the path toward almost certain confirmation goes as follows
AND
(I talk briefly about the likely politics of the nomination process below).
What is of more interest to me, however, is what her selection reveals 
AND
I am ignoring the importance of a president~’s veto power for the moment.)
Despite the much publicized and celebrated instances of presidential arm-twisting during the legislative 
AND
has already occurred, in the decision to present Sotomayor as his nominee.

====Winners win – empirics ====
**Green 2011**  -  professor of political science at Hofstra University (June 11, David, &amp;#34; The Do-Nothing 44th President &amp;#34; http://www.opednews.com/articles/The-Do-Nothing-44th-Presid-by-David-Michael-Gree-100611-648.html-http://www.opednews.com/articles/The-Do-Nothing-44th-Presid-by-David-Michael-Gree-100611-648.html)

The fundamental characteristic of the Obama presidency is that the president is a reactive object
AND
of the debate, but they determine which items are on the docket.
Moreover, there is a continuously evolving and reciprocal relationship between presidential boldness and achievement. In the same way that nothing breeds success like success, nothing sets the president up for achieving his or her next goal better than succeeding dramatically on the last go around.
This is absolutely a matter of perception, and you can see it best in 
AND
of the now retired Helen Thomas, this is precisely what they did.
But the game of successfully governing is substantive as well as psychological. More often than not, timidity turns out not to yield the safe course anticipated by those with weak knees, but rather their subsequent undoing. The three cases mentioned at the top of this essay are paradigmatic.
