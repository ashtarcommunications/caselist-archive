Shoutblogger, “4 Myths About Nuclear Energy,” March 23rd 2011, http://shoutbloger.blogspot.com/2011/03/4-myths-about-nuclear-energy.html
Today, nuclear power is far more expensive than coal or gas fired electricity, especially because nuclear materials are very expensive to build. Estimated cost of these materials reached $ 5 billion. An MIT study in 2009 estimated that the cost of nuclear energy production (including construction, maintenance and fuel) is about 30 percent higher than coal or gas.
Licensing is a barrier to SMR production
DOE, ’12

The potential barrier that licensing could pose to the commercial development of SMRs puts it at the forefront of strategic issues. Phase 1 of the strategic framework is focused directly on this challenge. Assuming this can be overcome, the next issue is to understand the potential for SMRs to compete in the marketplace. To assess this challenge, a quick review of the basic SMR business model may be useful.

The United States Federal Government should remove Nuclear Regulatory Commission safety restrictions on nuclear energy production in areas also regulated by state governments in the United States.
1AC Advantage One
Advantage one is safety:
NRC regulatory ineptitude makes a nuclear accident inevitable – there is a near miss more than once a month
Lochbaum, Director of the Nuclear Safety Project at the Union of Concerned Scientists with more than seventeen years of experience in commercial nuclear power plant operation as a Senior Engineer, March, ’13 
(The NRC and Nuclear Power Plant Safety in 2012, www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/nuclear_power/NRC-nuclear-safety-2012-report.pdf)
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is tolerating the intolerable
AND
them. NRC managers cannot fix problems they do not believe to exist.
Aging reactors are a unique accident risk – the NRC is weakening or failing to enforce safety regulations in order to extend the life of existing reactors
Dunn, AP National Investigative Team, 11 
(PART I: AP IMPACT: US nuke regulators weaken safety rules, www.ap.org/company/awards/part-i-aging-nukes)
Federal regulators have been working closely with the nuclear power industry to keep the nation&amp;#39;s 
AND
safety limits, regulators and reactor operators have loosened or bent the rules. 
The consequences of a nuclear accident should be evaluated on par with nuclear warfare – fallout will be massive and global
Drell, Professor emeritus of theoretical physics at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory at Stanford University, Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution, Member of the President&amp;#39;s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board and Science Advisory Committee, 12
(THE NUCLEAR ENTERPRISE High-Consequence Accidents: How to Enhance Safety and Minimize Risks in Nuclear Weapons and Reactors, pg. 1-3)
We live in dangerous times for many reasons. Prominent among them is the existence 
AND
the public by providing information on how to respond to such an event.
Negative evidence that accidents are unlikely and won’t be severe is steeped in institutional bias and ignores the newest and best data – accidents should be evaluated as extinction level events
Busby, Scientific Secretary European Committee on Radiation Risk, ’11
(Chris, Scientific Secretary of the European Committee on Radiation Risk. He is visiting Professor at the University of Ulster and also Guest Researcher at the Julius Kuehn Institute of the German Federal Agricultural Institute in Braunschweig, Germany. He was a member of the UK Committee Examining Radiation Risk on Internal Emitters CERRIE and the UK MoD Depleted Uranium Oversight Board. He was Science and Policy Interface leader of the Policy Information network on Child Health and Environment based in the Netherlands. He was Science and Technology Speaker for the Green Party of England and Wales. He has conducted fundamental research on the health effects of internal radiation both at the theoretical and epidemiological level, including recently on the genotoxic effects of the element uranium, “Deconstructing Nuclear Experts”, March 28, 2011, http://www.counterpunch.org/2011/03/28/deconstructing-nuclear-experts/)
Now I turn to the health effects. Wade trots out most of the usual 
AND
history, and the facts that they ignore. Mind the Gap indeed.
Independent of accidents lax NRC enforcement promotes mass destruction of ocean ecosystems causing extinction
Gunter, Director of the Reactor Oversight Project at NIRS, ’01 
(Licensed to Kill: How the nuclear power industry destroys endangered marine wildlife and ocean habitat to save money, www.nirs.org/reactorwatch/licensedtokill/LiscencedtoKill.pdf)
The NRC, the federal authority charged with enforcing compliance with take limits, mitigation 
AND
only the creatures themselves but the ability of humans to prosper and survive.
Damage done by nuclear power plants overwhelms ocean adaptation
Gunter, Director of the Reactor Oversight Project at NIRS, 01 
(Licensed to Kill: How the nuclear power industry destroys endangered marine wildlife and ocean habitat to save money, www.nirs.org/reactorwatch/licensedtokill/LiscencedtoKill.pdf)
Fish, fish larvae, and fish eggs are harmed and destroyed upon entering the 
AND
this way, entire marine communities can lose their capacity to sustain themselves.
Inadequate regulation allows leaks and spills which contaminate groundwater and undermine agriculture

(Leak First, Fix Later: Uncontrolled and Unmonitored Radioactive Releases from Nuclear Power Plants, www.beyondnuclear.org/storage/documents/LeakFirst_FixLater_BeyondNuclear_April182010_FINAL.pdf)
Water is necessary to sustain all life. Water is a natural cycle of vapor
AND
serves as a marker for many other radionuclides that escape into the environment.
Prevents global starvation
Stulp, ’09 – Agriculture Commissioner in Colorado (John, “America’s economy needs farmers,” Journal-Advocate, 3/20/2009, http://www.journal-advocate.com/news/2009/mar/20/americas-economy-needs-farmers/, JMP)
This week we commemorate American agriculture and the benefits it brings to our society, 
AND
continue to undergird the economy with products that touch every American every day.
States are taking action to effectively regulate nuclear power but they are preempted by NRC restrictions
Garvey, Legislative Attorney, 11 
(State Authority to Regulate Nuclear Power: Federal Preemption Under the Atomic Energy Act, https://www.hsdl.org/?viewanddid=718958)
A number of states have recently sought to take action to assure that nuclear power 
AND
falls within the field exclusively occupied by the NRC and is therefore preempted.
The aff solves preemption by eliminating an overlapping regulatory regime and demonstrating congressional intent
Garvey, Legislative Attorney, 11 
(State Authority to Regulate Nuclear Power: Federal Preemption Under the Atomic Energy Act, https://www.hsdl.org/?viewanddid=718958)
A state law, however, need not be utterly incompatible with federal law in 
AND
,” as any “inquiry into legislative motive is often an unsatisfactory venture.”
Decentralization is key to effective nuclear regulation – Reagan era NRC changes prove
Whitford, Assistant Professor of Polic Sci at Kansas, 02 
(Decentralization and Political Control of the Bureaucracy, Journal of Theoretical Politics, 14(2): 167-193, jtp.sagepub.com/content/14/2/167.full.pdf+html)
Unequivocally, Regions with more nuclear operations produced more actions after decentralization. The NRC 
AND
of bureaucrats to the task environment actually increased governmental activism by the NRC.
1AC Advantage Two
Advantage two is Japan:
Japan’s attempt to revamp its nuclear safety regulation post-Fukushima have failed to solve regulatory capture by the nuclear industry and reassure public safety concerns
WSJ 13 Wall Street Journal 
(1/31, Japan Overhauls Nuclear-Safety Rules, online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324156204578275690031511384.html
Japan&amp;#39;s revamped nuclear-safety regulator issued its first proposed safety guidelines, telling utilities 
AND
reactors. &amp;#34;During the process, the requirements can be watered down.&amp;#34;
Japans regulatory problems mirror the NRC’s – their nuclear shutdown will continue until regulatory confidence is restored
Dorfman, Professor of Law at Pace, 12 
(Fall, Pace Environmental Law Review, The Changing Perspectives of U.S and Japanese Nuclear Energy Policies in the Aftermath of the Fukushima Daiichi Disaster, digitalcommons.pace.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1711andcontext=pelr)
Japan’s Nuclear Safety Commission, similar to the United States’ NRC, labels itself an 
AND
to be re-established, a difficult task considering the damage done.
Japan models US safety Regulation

(It Could Happen Here, www.nytimes.com/2011/03/24/opinion/24Von-Hippel.html?pagewanted=alland_r=0)
IT will be years before we know the full consequences of the disaster at the 
AND

A number of states have recently sought to take action to assure that nuclear power &#xD;
AND&#xD;
falls within the field exclusively occupied by the NRC and is therefore preempted.&#xD;
The aff solves preemption by eliminating an overlapping regulatory regime and demonstrating congressional intent&#xD;

Unequivocally, Regions with more nuclear operations produced more actions after decentralization. The NRC &#xD;
