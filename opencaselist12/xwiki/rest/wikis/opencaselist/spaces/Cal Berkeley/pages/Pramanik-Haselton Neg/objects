Let me first stress that nuclear arms must never be thought of as a single 
AND
, as well as bring these conflicts to a swift and certain end.
Impact – Deterrence – Taiwan 2NC

U.S. nulear superiority is key to maintain the credibility of U.S. commitment to defend Taiwan
Payne ‘1
(Keith B.-, China Brief, “Post-Cold War Deterrence and a Taiwan Crisis”, Vol. 1 #5, http://www.jamestown.org/ 
programs/chinabrief/single/?tx_ttnewstt_news=3746andtx_ttnewsbackPid=191andno_cache=1; Jacob)

To establish a deterrence policy suited to these circumstances, the United States would have 
AND
subduing Taiwan before U.S. forces could be brought to bear.
Perhaps the most limiting factor for Washington in this regard is the obvious fact that 
AND
limit its own prospective losses to a level compatible with the stakes involved.
In sum, a U.S. deterrence policy for this case would focus 
AND
balance with the prospective costs and risks involved in a conflict with China.

Extinction
Strait Times ‘00
(June 25, “Regional Fallout: No one gains in war over Taiwan”, Lexis; Jacob)

THE high-intensity scenario postulates a cross-strait war escalating into a full-scale war between the US and China. If Washington were to conclude that splitting China would better serve its national interests, then a full-scale war becomes unavoidable.
Conflict on such a scale would embroil other countries far and near and ~-~- horror of horrors ~-~- raise the possibility of a nuclear war.
Beijing has already told the US and Japan privately that it considers any country providing bases and logistics support to any US forces attacking China as belligerent parties open to its retaliation.
In the region, this means South Korea, Japan, the Philippines and, to a lesser extent, Singapore.
If China were to retaliate, east Asia will be set on fire.
And the conflagration may not end there as opportunistic powers elsewhere may try to overturn the existing world order.
With the US distracted, Russia may seek to redefine Europe&amp;#39;s political landscape. The balance of power in the Middle East may be similarly upset by the likes of Iraq.
In south Asia, hostilities between India and Pakistan, each armed with its own nuclear arsenal, could enter a new and dangerous phase.
Will a full-scale Sino-US war lead to a nuclear war?
According to General Matthew Ridgeway, commander of the US Eighth Army which fought against the Chinese in the Korean War, the US had at the time thought of using nuclear weapons against China to save the US from military defeat.
In his book The Korean War, a personal account of the military and political aspects of the conflict and its implications on future US foreign policy, Gen Ridgeway said that US was confronted with two choices in Korea ~-~- truce or a broadened war, which could have led to the use of nuclear weapons.
If the US had to resort to nuclear weaponry to defeat China long before the latter acquired a similar capability, there is little hope of winning a war against China 50 years later, short of using nuclear weapons.
The US estimates that China possesses about 20 nuclear warheads that can destroy major American cities. Beijing also seems prepared to go for the nuclear option.
A Chinese military officer disclosed recently that Beijing was considering a review of its &amp;#34;non first use&amp;#34; principle regarding nuclear weapons.
Major-General Pan Zhangqiang, president of the military-funded Institute for Strategic Studies, told a gathering at the Woodrow Wilson International Centre for Scholars in Washington that although the government still abided by that principle, there were strong pressures from the military to drop it.
He said military leaders considered the use of nuclear weapons mandatory if the country risked dismemberment as a result of foreign intervention.
Gen Ridgeway said that should that come to pass, we would see the destruction of civilization.
There would be no victors in such a war. While the prospect of a nuclear Armageddon over Taiwan might seem inconceivable, it cannot be ruled out entirely, for China puts sovereignty above everything else.

Turn Cyber
Deterrence is key to prevent cyberwarfare
Grossman Editor-in-Chief Inside the Air Force ‘9 
(Elaine M.-, May 12, Global Security Newswire, “U.S. General Reserves Right to Use Force, Even Nuclear, in Response to Cyber Attack”, http://www.globalsecuritynewswire.org/gsn/nw_20090512_4977.php; Jacob)

The top U.S. commander for strategic combat said last week that the White House retains the option to respond with physical force ~-~- potentially even using nuclear weapons ~-~- if a foreign entity conducts a disabling cyber attack against U.S. computer networks (see GSN, Nov. 7, 2008).
While a nuclear response appears highly unlikely, it might be counted among a full range of options offered to the president following a major computer attack, suggested Gen. Kevin Chilton, who heads U.S. Strategic Command. However, the general noted, it might be no easy task to identify with certainty the origin of a cyber strike.
&amp;#34;I think you don&amp;#39;t take any response options off the table from an attack on the United States of America,&amp;#34; he told reporters during a Defense Writers Group breakfast on Thursday. &amp;#34;Why would we constrain ourselves on how we respond?&amp;#34;
Hackers located in China are believed to have carried out a growing number of computer intrusions, most recently accessing large amounts of data on the Defense Department&amp;#39;s $300 billion Joint Strike Fighter program, the Wall Street Journal reported last month. Earlier reported incidents include cyber break-ins of the U.S. electrical power grid, where suspected Chinese and Russian hackers left behind software that could be activated later to disrupt service.
Should the breaches evolve into more serious computer attacks against the United States, Chilton said he could not rule out the possibility of a military salvo against a nation like China, even though Beijing has nuclear arms. He rejected the idea that such a conflict would necessarily risk going nuclear.
&amp;#34;I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s true,&amp;#34; Chilton said.
At the same time, the general insisted that all strike options, including nuclear, would remain available to the commander in chief in defending the nation from cyber strikes.

The aff’s market-based approach to sustainability exacerbates social inequality and drives environmental destruction – they block criticism of the market by making it the solution to environmental problems, backdoor sanctioning excessive consumption by blaming market distortion for a failure to produce green energy technologies
Gunder 6
(Michael, senior lecturer in the School of Architecture and Planning at the University of Auckland, New Zealand, President of the New Zealand Planning Institute, “Sustainability: Planning’s Saving Grace or Road to Perdition?”, Journal of Planning Education and Research 2006; 26; 208) 
 
This article begins by tracing sustainability’s rise to prominence in planning education and its emergence 
AND
carrying capacities of the planet largely are overlooked, if not outright negated.  
Consumption practices ensure extinction – cause overshoot and collapse of the environment, only re-organizing society can solve
Smith 11
(Gar, Editor Emeritus of Earth Island Journal, “NUCLEAR¶ ROULETTE¶ THE CASE AGAINST A¶ “NUCLEAR RENAISSANCE” Pgs. 46)

Even if all of the world’s current energy output could be produced by renewables, 
AND
.¶ would require the resources of 16 planets—eight planets each. 225
Our alternative is to reject the politics of technological production
Rather than focusing on production of technology, we should embrace our ability to shape and transform our subjectivity as consumers, embracing voluntary simplicity – this debate offers a crucial moment to produce alternative knowledge about everyday living practices

(Samuel, University of Melbourne; Office for Environmental Programs/Simplicity Institute, “
Voluntary Simplicity as an Aesthetics of Existence”, Social Sciences Research Network, http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1941087) 

The  aim  of  this  paper,  however,  is  not  to  present  a  thorough  analysis  
AND
might  open  up  space  to  ‘think  differently,’18  to  think  otherwise.

Resource Extraction Impact/AT Stability Impacts
Solar tech relies on rare earth mineral extraction that causes massive global instability and collapses democracy and trade – it relies on corruption and social inequality to maintain economic production
Bringezu and Bleischwitz ‘11
(Stefan, director of material flows and resource management at the Wuppertal Institute, Germany, and a member of the International Panel for Sustainable Resource Management, Raimund, co-director of material flows and resource management at the Wuppertal Institute and professor at the College of Europe, Bruges, Belgium, “Preventing a resource curse fuelled by the green economy”, Global Corruption Report: Climate Change, pg. 199-201 http://www.transparency.org/publications/gcr/gcr_climate_change2)

Mining, a second activity necessary to support the green economy, carries significant opportunities 
AND
Public Officials, while China and Russia have ratified only the former.23

2NC Consumption Framework
The aff’s calls for pragmatism and specificity are a farce – their change in energy strategy represents conscious adoption of larger institutional logics, not an incremental change in existing policy – only radical analysis of the energy system takes the aff’s change seriously and avoids error replication
Byrne and Toly 6
(Josh, director of the Center for Energy and Environmental Policy and distinguished professor of energy and climate policy at the University of Delaware, Noah, Associate Professor of Urban Studies and Politics and International Relations, Director of Urban Studies Program at Wheaton, “Energy as a Social Project: Recovering a Discourse”, pgs. 1-32 in Transforming Power: Energy, Environment, and Society in Conflict, eds. Josh Byrne, Noah Toly, and Leigh Glover)

When measured in social and political-economic terms, the current energy discourse appears 
AND
, leave modernism undisturbed (except, perhaps, for its environmental performance).
AT Util

Utilitarianism is prejudiced – it excludes environmental damage from ethical calculations and treats it as a victimless crime – a shift towards techniques of the self prompts individual responsibility for ecological damage and acknowledges the existing social system as a product of our behavior and knowledge production
Alexander ‘11
(Samuel, University of Melbourne; Office for Environmental Programs/Simplicity Institute, “
Voluntary Simplicity as an Aesthetics of Existence”, Social Sciences Research Network, http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1941087) 

Undoubtedly there is, and Foucault never denied this. Nietzsche occasionally seemed to conflate 
AND
are less likely to become entrenched in any one, particular narrative.42

Solar Link
Solar energy mystifies existing consumption practices, greening them to remove guilt for our unsustainable ecological footprint
Byrne and Toly 6
(Josh, director of the Center for Energy and Environmental Policy and distinguished professor of energy and climate policy at the University of Delaware, Noah, Associate Professor of Urban Studies and Politics and International Relations, Director of Urban Studies Program at Wheaton, “Energy as a Social Project: Recovering a Discourse”, pgs. 1-32 in Transforming Power: Energy, Environment, and Society in Conflict, eds. Josh Byrne, Noah Toly, and Leigh Glover)

In this regard, ironically, Small-is-Beautiful Solar shares with Big 
AND
in a way that would seamlessly tie it to the modernization project.20
Renewables Link
Renewables reproduce neoliberal social relations – they’re driven by a desire to maintain status quo consumption, and emanate from profit-motivated corporations 
Byrne and Toly 6
(Josh, director of the Center for Energy and Environmental Policy and distinguished professor of energy and climate policy at the University of Delaware, Noah, Associate Professor of Urban Studies and Politics and International Relations, Director of Urban Studies Program at Wheaton, “Energy as a Social Project: Recovering a Discourse”, pgs. 1-32 in Transforming Power: Energy, Environment, and Society in Conflict, eds. Josh Byrne, Noah Toly, and Leigh Glover)

Where the power to govern is not vested in experts, it is given over 
AND
victories or diminish the central role of ‘energy’ in the movement’s quest?


AT Perm/Link Turn

Sequencing DA – centering consumption as a subject of ethical concern is a pre-requisite to the aff – their “production-focused” change to energy policy only marginalizes consumption practices by treating them as a given outside of politics
Alexander ‘11
(Samuel, University of Melbourne; Office for Environmental Programs/Simplicity Institute, “
Voluntary Simplicity as an Aesthetics of Existence”, Social Sciences Research Network, http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1941087)

For present purposes, the third and final point about how neoclassicism marginalizes consumption concerns 
AND
above was intended to suggest that consumption might be one such blind spot.

import quotas, and local content requirements, and investments in infrastructure facilities.

Vote Neg:
Predictable Limits – We added a qualifier to the word “incentive” precisely because it was too broad – Including non-financial incentives explodes the topic by several new ways of doing every aff.  Prefer our interpretation because it creates a clear, predictable line between incentives that change production costs per unit and mandates that increase overall demand. 

Ground – Testing the “financial” in financial incentive is core neg CP and solvency ground – using a non-financial mechanism guts DA links too because the way voters and markets react to subsidies and tax breaks is substantially different than to a minor change in what the government decides to buy.

• Feed-in-Tariffs. This incentive type reduces investment risk by providing fixed payments for projects based on the levelized cost of renewable energy generation.

B.	Violation – The aff does not incentivize the process of transforming solar energy into electricity, it only supports the creation of equipment/facilities that MIGHT produce electricity LATER 

C.	Vote Neg
Predictable Limits – There are hundreds of factors that influence whether solar power gets produced – Allowing affs to promote factors of production means they could incentivize students to go into STEM or subsidize RandD. Only requiring the aff’s incentive be CONTINGENT on production creates a predictable limit on aff mechanisms 
Ground – Incentivizing capital instead of production means the aff doesn’t have to defend “production good.”  At best they are effectually topical which guts stable CP and DA ground and forces us to concede solvency to get back to square 1.

Text: The State of California should procure mobile solar power systems to provide for the California Emergency Management Agency’s training exercises and operations in response to emergencies in the United States.
The counterplan solves ~-~-- it is a California based company that is building mobile solar power systems to help with emergencies
Holloway, 12 (5/29/2012, James, “California start-up inks FEMA deal to provide disaster relief solar villages,” http://www.gizmag.com/green-horizon-quickhab/22719/)

Following five years of research and development, California start-up and provider of disaster relief technology Green Horizon has begun shipping a solar-powered services hub capable of providing electricity and clean water to disaster-hit communities. Combined with its QuickHab and SFH40 rapid-assembly prefabricated homes, Green Horizon has come up with a trio of rapid-response technologies that the company hopes will transform our responses to natural disasters by providing, essentially, rapid-assembly solar powered villages.
San Francisco builder James Pope was compelled to develop a practical relief shelter following Hurricane Katrina, when thousands of trailers provided to victims by FEMA were found to emit formaldehyde fumes. Five years after setting up Green Horizon, the result is the QuickHab prefabricated home designed for simple and rapid transport and construction.

Though the QuickHab looks simple, functionally it offers more than mere shelter. Each unit is equipped with a water heater, shower, toilet and kitchenette. There are standardized connections for electricity, water and sewerage. It even comes with a lockable front door, which, despite the obvious practical advantages is a very human touch (imagine offering someone their own door key within hours of their losing their home).
It&amp;#39;s well and good to have connections for essential services, but with nothing to connect them to, a shower or electric hob is useless. The supply of clean drinking water after natural disasters such as hurricanes is one of the most critical short-term responses. It&amp;#39;s to this end that Green Horizon developed its Central Service Unit, which provides both power and clean water to disaster-hit communities.

Renewables West, 12 (11/14/2012, “BREAKING NEWS: SUPERSTORM SANDY RELIEF FROM MOBILE SUNPOWER,” http://www.renewableswest.com/)

San Leandro, CA – Wednesday 14 November 2012.  Yesterday, a lot of New Yorkers saw something roll in they’ve never seen before:  a mobile solar power generator.  This particular solar generator has a 5kW+ solar PV array with massive battery storage and a hybrid backup 30kVA diesel generator on board to guarantee 24/7 electric power generation for emergencies.
The “SolaRover” generator was driven overnight from Colorado to New York to help victims of Superstorm Sandy.  Clean, zero-carbon-footprint, electrical power is created from the Sun and stored in batteries on the custom-built trailer.  This is new technology who’s concept grew out of Katrina, as a response to the many problems of diesel generators that didn’t start, didn’t have enough fuel or couldn’t be reached by fuel trucks for resupply.
Today, Wednesday, 11/14, the SolaRover generator is in use at Citi Field (NYC response center) powering command trailers and lights.
Thursday, 11/15, the generator will move to the Rockaways, powering a local medical clinic at 196 Beach at 113th, Rockaway Park, NY.   The generator will be in service here for at least several days.
We’re working to provide electrical power for victims of every natural disaster, to be

Schell’s argument is appealing, but it is
less than convincing. While it is true that
the democratization of Germany and
Japan after World War II led to the virtual
de-bellicization of their populations,
and while the emergence (however
halting and episodic it might be) of a
unified Europe portends an end to the
risk of war emanating from that region,
such developments cannot assure us
that the causes of war are about to
eliminated from the international
system. To be sure, the collapse of the
Soviet state spelled the end of the last
great European territorial empire, but
this hardly can be taken to guarantee
that no other state will ever again aspire
to old-style imperial rule. Chechen
separatism or secessionism by other
minority peoples in Russia may yet,
through violent repression, unleash
retrograde, atavistic political forces.
Large parts of China’s territory are in fact
at risk of secessionist dismemberment
as well. And no Indian political party is
ever likely to publicly assent to the
secession of Kashmir. Democratic
governance does not eliminate
nationalism, rather it can in fact lead to
its magnification and intensification—
especially if governments are unable to
deliver promised economic progress in
the short-term.

The central point that needs emphasis is
that the ‘nuclear peace’ is far from
secure—indeed it is getting more
insecure with each passing year. The tide
of technological innovation is sweeping
around the world just as fast or faster
than the tide of democratization. Viewed
from this perspective the risk of repeated
wars in which nuclear and/or biological
weapons are used is probably rising, not
diminishing. And once the first true
‘two-way’ nuclear/biological conflict
occurs the floodgates on proliferation
may really open—thus setting the stage
for repeated wars of genocidal attack.
The risk of self-induced human
