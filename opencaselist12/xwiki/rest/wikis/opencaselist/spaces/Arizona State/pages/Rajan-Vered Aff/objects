Inherency

Observation One: Inherency
Nuclear renaissance now – US subsidizing the industry.
Worthington 12 (David Worthington, February 9, 2012, The U.S. nuclear renaissance has begun  , Smart Planet, http://www.smartplanet.com/blog/intelligent-energy/the-us-nuclear-renaissance-has-begun/13058) JD

 

There are cooling towers on the horizon in the United States. The nuclear renaissance

AND

million homes at a cost of US$14 billion, CNN reported.

But, the US is not reversing course on reprocessing.
Saillan 10 (Charles, attorney with the New Mexico Environment Department, Harvard Environmental Law Review, 2010, “DISPOSAL OF SPENT NUCLEAR FUEL IN THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE: A PERSISTENT ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEM”, Vol. 34, RSR)

 

The U.S. government’s position on reprocessing changed in 1974 when India exploded

AND

in 2009, and is “no longer pursuing domestic commercial reprocessing.” 157

Waste

 

Observation Two: Waste
In the short term US nuclear waste is stored on-site.
Galbraith 11 (Kate, Staff Writer, “A New Urgency to the Problem of Storing Nuclear Waste”, New York Times, 11-27-11, http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/28/business/energy-environment/a-new-urgency-to-the-problem-of-storing-nuclear-waste.html, RSR)

 

Other countries are also looking at waste in new ways in the post-Fukushima

AND

disposal site for spent fuel , near the remote northeastern village of Bure.

On-site storage is dangerous – storage pools are vulnerable to accidents.
Alvarez 12 (Robert, Senior Scholar at IPS, where he is currently focused on nuclear disarmament, environmental, and energy policies, “Improving Spent-Fuel Storage at Nuclear Reactors”, Winter, ISSUES IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, RSR)

 

Until the NAS completes its study, if it agrees to do so, the

area declined by almost half because of migration to areas of lower contamination.

The densely packed fuel is enough to trigger a full scaled meltdown – Fukushima proves.
Kinitisch 11 (Eli, Reporter at Science Magazine, “Waste Panel Expected To Back Interim Storage”, Science Magazine, Vol. 333, 7-8-11, RSR)

In any case, experts agree, some new plan for waste storage is essential

AND

calls for an expert panel at the National Academies to tackle the subject.

These catastrophic meltdowns cause extinction – reactors contain 100x the radiation of nuclear bombs.
Lendman 11 (Stephen, Research Associate of the Centre for Research on Globalization,

03/ 13, “Nuclear Meltdown in Japan,”, The People’s Voice http://www.thepeoplesvoice.org/TPV3/Voices.php/2011/03/13/nuclear-meltdown-in-japan, accessed 8-2-12, RSR)

 

Reuters said the 1995 Kobe quake caused $100 billion in damage, up to

entire region. &amp;#34;It could be, literally, an apocalyptic event.

On-site waste storage is the EASIEST target for a terrorist attack – it’s the most vulnerable.
Rogers 6 (Ken, Professor and Chair of the Political Science Department at Coastal Carolina University, “Radioactive Waste Storage/Disposal Policy: A Paradigm for Homeland Security and Energy Security”, Midsouth Political Science Review, 2006, Vol. 8, RSR)

 

The inability of U.S. policymakers to come to grips with the problem

AND

is not to the reactors, but the radioactive waste that they generate.

On site storage vulnerable to terrorist theft – fewer security measures due to assumed radioactive safeguards.
Bunn 9 (Matthew, Associate Professor at Harvard University&amp;#39;s John F. Kennedy School of Government, “Reducing the greatest risks of nuclear theft and terrorism”, Daedalus, American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Fall, RSR)

 

A building with nuclear material that terrorists could readily make into a nuclear bomb needs

AND

also be able to make a bomb from reactor-grade plutonium. 6

Nuclear terrorism is likely and causes extinction – security experts agree.
Rhodes 9 (Richard, affiliate of the Center for International Security and Cooperation at Stanford University, Former visiting scholar at Harvard and MIT, and author of “The Making of the Atomic Bomb” which won the Pulitzer Prize in Nonfiction, National Book Award, and National Book Critics Circle Award, “Reducing the nuclear threat: The argument for public safety” 12-14, http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/op-eds/reducing-the-nuclear-threat-the-argument-public-safety, RSR)

 

The response was very different among nuclear and national security experts when Indiana Republican Sen

In the long term, waste will be stored at Yucca – only option.
Tollefson 11 (Jeff, former Knight fellow in science journalism at MIT,  “Battle of Yucca Mountain rages on”, Nature, Vol. 473, No. 266, 5-19-11, RSR)

can go back and measure them again. They&amp;#39;re very easy to verify.&amp;#34;

Yucca explosion results in extinction – top geologists agree.
Broad 90 (William, NYT Staff, The New York Times, November 18)

 

One scientist, however, has quietly but persistently warned that this vision of a

AND

If you want to envision the end of the world, that&amp;#39;s it.&amp;#34;

Reprocessing would remove the entire waste problem – all of the waste we currently store can be reused.
Bastin 8 (Clinton, Former Chemical Engineer at the Atomic Energy Commission, 21st Century Science and Technology, “We Need to Reprocess Spent Nuclear Fuel, And Can Do It Safely, At Reasonable Cost”, 2008, http://www.21stcenturysciencetech.com/Articles%202008/ Summer_2008/Reprocessing.pdf, RSR)

 

The concept of used nuclear fuel as “nuclear waste” is a fiction created

AND

fabricated directly into new reactor fuel assemblies to be burned in nuclear plants.

Reprocessing solves the blow up of Yucca Mountain.
Broad 95 (William, NYT staff, Scientists fear atomic explosion of buried waste, The New York Times, March 5, p. 1)

 

Dr. Bowman says the explosion thesis is alive and well. On Friday he

Peak Oil

Observation Three: Peak oil
Peak oil coming soon – newest data proves.
Worstall 12 (Tim, Contributor, “Peak Oil is Here: Now What?”, Forbes, 5-2-12, http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2012/05/02/peak-oil-is-here-now-what/, RSR)

 

At least peak oil is here if I’ve understood what the peak oil argument is

AND

oil and gas producers could reach close to US$100/bbl.

Reprocessing solves peak oil - nuclear energy can help hydrogen replace oil in the transportation sector.
Choppin 6 (Gregory, Robert O. Lawton Distinguished Professor of Chemistry at Florida State University, “Technology for Nuclear Reprocessing: Present and Future Directions”, Separation Science and Technology, 41: 1955–1963, 2006, RSR)

 

At present, internationally, nuclear power has reached a good level of scientific and

AND

radioactive fission products for other use would avoid their disposal in the repositories.

Reprocessing increases nuclear energy’s share in the market, displacing oil.

Plan Text

Thus the plan: The United States Federal Government should provide a twenty-percent investment tax credit for the deployment of domestic nuclear fuel recycling.
Solvency[P1] [P2] 

Observation Four: Solvency
Tax incentives would solve for reprocessing – makes it commercially more desirable.
Lagus 5 (Todd, 2005 WISE Intern, University of Minnesota, WISE, “Reprocessing of Spent Nuclear Fuel: A Policy Analysis” http://www.wise-intern.org/journal/2005/lagus.pdf, RSR)

spending taxpayer money on Chinese firms to build U.S. bridges.
States CP are V/I. 1.) No comparative literature compares the action of 50 states simultaneously vs. the federal government. Kills education because it removes substantive clash about energy production. 2.) Fiat abuse – uniformity eliminates the only aff against state action, which is enforcement. Kills competitive equity.

the goal of remaining below 2 °C will very soon become unachievable.&#xD;

 THE future consequences of global warming are the least known aspect of the problem&#xD;

Reprocessing solves warming in two ways:&#xD;

First, reprocessing is key to a revived U.S. clean energy program that provides leadership to win agreements to cut emissions and solve warming.&#xD;
Roberts 4 (Paul, Energy Expert and Writer for Harpers, The End of Oil, pg. 325-326)&#xD;
&#xD;
Politically, a new U.S. energy policy would send a powerful message &#xD;

business prospects in China that it now has its own vehicles in Beijing.”&#xD;
&#xD;
Second, only allowing for reprocessing allows for nuclear power to transition to a carbon free economy fast enough to avoid catastrophic warming – best modeling flows aff.&#xD;

This paper applies a model with price-induced substitution across resources to examine the &#xD;

Observation Two: Waste

In the short term US nuclear waste is stored on-site.
Galbraith 11 (Kate, Staff Writer, “A New Urgency to the Problem of Storing Nuclear Waste”, New York Times, 11-27-11, http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/28/business/energy-environment/a-new-urgency-to-the-problem-of-storing-nuclear-waste.html, RSR)
Other countries are also looking at waste in new ways in the post-Fukushima

On-site storage is dangerous – storage pools are vulnerable to accidents.
Alvarez 12 (Robert, Senior Scholar at IPS, where he is currently focused on nuclear disarmament, environmental, and energy policies, “Improving Spent-Fuel Storage at Nuclear Reactors”, Winter, ISSUES IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, RSR)
Until the NAS completes its study, if it agrees to do so, the

area declined by almost half because of migration to areas of lower contamination.

The densely packed fuel is enough to trigger a full scaled meltdown – Fukushima proves.
Kinitisch 11 (Eli, Reporter at Science Magazine, “Waste Panel Expected To Back Interim Storage”, Science Magazine, Vol. 333, 7-8-11, RSR)
In any case, experts agree, some new plan for waste storage is essential
AND
calls for an expert panel at the National Academies to tackle the subject.

These catastrophic meltdowns cause extinction – reactors contain 100x the radiation of nuclear bombs. 
Lendman 11 (Stephen, Research Associate of the Centre for Research on Globalization, 
03/ 13, “Nuclear Meltdown in Japan,”, The People’s Voice http://www.thepeoplesvoice.org/TPV3/Voices.php/2011/03/13/nuclear-meltdown-in-japan, accessed 8-2-12, RSR)

The concept of used nuclear fuel as “nuclear waste” is a fiction created

Observation Three: Peak uranium

Peak uranium is coming by 2016.
Keen 12 (Kip, Uranium supply crunch by 2016 - nuclear expert says, Mineweb, 24 January 2012, http://www.mineweb.co.za/mineweb/view/mineweb/en/page72103?oid=143915andsn=Detailandpid=102055, da 8-27-12)
A nuclear expert gave uranium supply three more years - at most - before it 
AND
in his &amp;#34;downside&amp;#34; analysis the uranium deficit still comes by 2015.

Increased domestic production of uranium is key to our tritium supply – foreign sources cannot solve. 
Rowny 12 edward, retired Lieutenant General, was chief negotiator with the rank of ambassador in the START arms control negotiations with the Soviet Union and has served as an arms control adviser and negotiator for five presidents, Roll Call, 3-29-2012,

Oil may grab headlines, but nuclear power for civilian use is growing, as 
AND
uranium needed to produce tritium, our national security will be at risk.

That’s key to the nuclear deterrent.
Gaffney 10 (Frank, founder and president of the Center for Security Policy, “There Goes the Nuclear Deterrent”, Breitbart, 10-14-2010, http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Peace/2010/10/14/There-Goes-the-Nuclear-Deterrent)
The House Armed Services Committee warned in 1993 that the deterrent was being subjected to

warheads must be regularly refueled in order for those weapons to remain operable. 

Nuclear deterrence necessary to deter rogue states, CBW attacks, power challengers, and allied proliferation - impact is extinction.
Schneider 9 (Mark, Senior Analyst with the National Institute for Public Policy, May/April 2009 “The Future of the US Nuclear Deterrent” Comparative Strategy, p345-360)
According to the Pentagon’s Quadrennial Defense Review, the United States must maintain a “
AND
legacy arms control and its constraints upon U.S. conventional capabilities. 

Adoption of reprocessing solves U.S. uranium needs
Sayre 11 (Edwin, engineering consultant, “Commercial Value of Used Nuclear Fuel Reprocessed with Elements Separated, Purified and Reduced to Metals”, NIST, 2011, http://www.nist.gov/tip/wp/pswp/upload/164_commercial_value_used_nuclear_fuel_reprocessed.pdf)
The commercial value of the elements in the used fuel as indicated in Table 1 
AND

US nuclear reprocessing lead to a spillover of the technology internationally.
Acton 9 (James, J. associate in the Nonproliferation Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International  Peace, Survival, Vol. 51, No. 4, “Nuclear Power, Disarmament and Technological Restraint”, RSR)
Thus, not only does reprocessing clearly not help with facilitating take back, but 
AND
the nuclear RandD community – that support the development of reprocessing. 

Nuclear reprocessing solves peak uranium internationally.
Berry and Tolley 10 (R. Stephen and George S., Professors at the University of Chicago, Nuclear Fuel Reprocessing: Future Prospects and Viability, University of Chicago, 29 November 2010, http://humanities.uchicago.edu/orgs/institute/bigproblems/Team7-1210.pdf, da 8-29-12)
Uranium prices have also been rising due to increased demand, a trend that may

Thus the plan: The United States Federal Government should provide a twenty-percent investment tax credit for the deployment of domestic nuclear fuel recycling.

Observation Four: Solvency

Tax incentives would solve for reprocessing – makes it commercially more desirable
Lagus 5 (Todd, 2005 WISE Intern, University of Minnesota, WISE, “Reprocessing of Spent Nuclear Fuel: A Policy Analysis” http://www.wise-intern.org/journal/2005/lagus.pdf, RSR)
The economic analysis shows that the reprocessing or even the once through nuclear cycle is

This weekend’s election in Russia has unsurprisingly returned Vladimir Putin to the country’s presidency.

Observation Three: Plutonium

Plutonium-238 is critical to all of NASA’s power needs – studies show no other isotopes work. Plus, plutonium-238 is not being produced by any country, supplies are running low, and Congress hasn’t provided funding to restart production.

We meet: Nuclear fuel recycling is energy production.
World Nuclear Association 12 Processing of Used Nuclear Fuel, http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf69.html
Used nuclear fuel has long been reprocessed to extract fissile materials for recycling and to 
AND
after about 100 years falls much more rapidly than in used fuel itself.¶ 
Counter interpretation: 
The aff has to affect both resource extraction and conversion into energy
Australian Government, Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency 2011 “Energy Production and Consumption,” http://www.climatechange.gov.au/government/initiatives/national-greenhouse-energy-reporting/publications/supplementary-guidelines/energy-production-consumption.aspx
Production of energy: in relation to a facility, means the:
a.	extraction or capture of energy from natural sources for final consumption by or from the operation of the facility or for use other than in the operation of the facility
b.	manufacture of energy by the conversion of energy from one form to another form for final consumption by or from the operation of the facility, or for use other than in the operation of the facility (regulation 2.23(3) NGER Regulations).
We meet the counter-interpretation: recycling involves both the act of reprocessing the used fuel and using it to create new nuclear energy.
Our interp good:
A. Predictability – Only our interpretation guarantees link arguments to both extraction and the burning of resources to produce energy. This is crucial link ground for pollution DAs and domestic/foreign energy tradeoff DAs. 
B. Limits: Requiring the aff to both extract and convert the energy is necessary to eliminate affs that only extract, like capture carbon or methane or stockpile oil as a strategic military reserve with heg advantages. Also key to prevent affs that only burn fuels like Bataille-style affs that encourage rapid consumption or RandD affs that incentivize new ways to burn the same resources.
Not effects T – increase energy.
Their interp bad:
They get rid of all uranium extraction affs because extraction from waste is identical to extraction from the ground. This means they get rid of oil and natural gas extraction affs which is literally half the topic. 
Competing interpretations are bad: Race to the bottom: they’re just trying to limit out one more case
Prefer reasonability: as long as we’re reasonably topical, there’s no reason to pull the trigger. Don’t vote on potential abuse.
