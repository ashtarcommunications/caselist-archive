restriction n. any limitation on activity, by statute, regulation or contract provision. In multi-unit real estate developments, condominium and cooperative housing projects, managed by homeowners~’ associations or similar organizations are usually required by state law to impose restrictions on use. Thus, the restrictions are part of the &amp;#34;covenants, conditions and restrictions,&amp;#34; intended to enhance the use of common facilities and property, recorded and incorporated into the title of each owner.
