Gas Advantage
Natural gas is gaining market dominance – expansion of nuclear power avoids a bridge to nowhere
Jesse Jenkins, director of energy and climate policy at the Breakthrough Institute, previously worked as a Policy and Research Associate at the Renewable Northwest Project, 1-20-2012, “Avoiding a Natural Gas Bridge to Nowhere,” The Energy Collective, http://theenergycollective.com/breakthroughinstitut/74658/avoiding-natural-gas-bridge-nowhere
Just as the history of unconventional natural gas 
AND 
depends on our willingness to invest in innovation.
Long term lock in is coming – building up alternatives is key
Christopher Jones, Ciriacy-Wantrup Fellow, University of California-Berkeley, 8-29-2012, “Natural Gas: Bridge or Dead End?” Huffington Post, http://www.huffingtonpost.com/christopher-f-jones/bridge-or-dead-end_b_1837015.html
Natural gas is often touted as a bridge 
AND 
, but also about building off-ramps. 
Use natural gas as a bridge to nowhere ensures a methane apocalypse – expansion of nuclear reduces the short run magnitude of emissions preventing the climate from crossing short run tipping points. 
Bill Chameides, Dean, Duke University&amp;#39;s Nicholas School of the Environment, 7-20-2012, “Natural Gas: A Bridge to a Low-Carbon Future or Not?” Huffington Post, http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bill-chameides/-natural-gas-a-bridge-to_b_1690857.html
Not really, scientists like Bob Howarth of 
AND 
is flushed from the atmosphere? Probably not.
Controlling methane emissions is more important than CO2 – methane hits us while we are vulnerable.

The latest EPA study confirms that its original 
AND 
states the reference data was bad all along.  
Methane release is insulated from the warming debate – unique threat

The United States needs an &amp;#34;all of

a safe and sustainable portfolio of energy resources.
Price spikes are inevitable and collapse the economy without nuclear power
Rod Adams, gained his nuclear knowledge as a submarine engineer officer and as the founder of a company that tried to develop a market for small, modular reactors from 1993-1999, 8-30-2012, “Will natural gas prices in North America skyrocket by the end of 2014?” The Energy Collective, http://theenergycollective.com/rodadams/107901/look-out-natural-gas-prices-north-america-will-skyrocket-end-2014?ref=node_other_posts_by

Manufacturing is critically important to the American economy

No decoupling – US key to global demand and US protectionism kills the global economy
Desmond Lachman, resident fellow at AEI, 11-1-2007, “The Global Economic Decoupling Myth,” AEI, http://www.aei.org/article/27052
Not so long ago, the conventional wisdom

Natural gas is gaining market dominance – expansion of nuclear power avoids a bridge to nowhere
Jesse Jenkins, director of energy and climate policy at the Breakthrough Institute, previously worked as a Policy and Research Associate at the Renewable Northwest Project, 1-20-2012, “Avoiding a Natural Gas Bridge to Nowhere,” The Energy Collective, http://theenergycollective.com/breakthroughinstitut/74658/avoiding-natural-gas-bridge-nowhere

A new journal article finds that methane leakage greatly undercuts or eliminates entirely the climate

Nuclear terrorism. The spread of nuclear weapons also increases the risk of nuclear terrorism

A terrorist nuclear attack, and even the use of nuclear weapons in response by 
AND
for the terrorists. This might not help the chances of nuclear restraint.
It causes the same causalities as full scale nuke war

To an increasing extent, people are congregating in the world’s great urban centers,

Government support overcomes financial barriers – key hurdle

Operation costs are competitive – it’s just getting them built
Charles Ferguson, president of the Federation of American Scientists, November 2011, “JAPAN MELTED DOWN. BUT THAT DOESN&amp;#39;T MEAN THE END OF THE ATOMIC AGE,” Foreign Policy issue 189, EBSCO 
IN FACT, NUCLEAR POWER plants are relatively cheap to operate. Averaging the costs 
AND
a good deal, once you factor in the risks of climate change.
State incentives fail – capital costs too high
Ben Moshe, et al 2011 Kelley Michael Gale is the Finance Department Chair

Similar to this political risk, investors in new domestic nuclear reactors will likely face 
AND
it can be adapted to best encourage private sector financing for nuclear energy. 

No impact to radiation – Chernobyl proves
Barry Brook, Professor of Climate Change at the University of Adelaide, 2-19-2013, “Of Climate, Oil, and Nuclear Energy Fears,” The Energy Collective, http://theenergycollective.com/barrybrook/187711/two-decades-and-counting
Let me say one last thing about Chernobyl before moving on. The accident at 
AND
all that contamination done in Turkey? Nothing. Bring on those apricots!

No politics
DOE is funding SMRS
Ben Bradford, press secretary for a Member of Congress, 2-4-2013, “Are Mini-Reactors The Future Of Nuclear Power?” NPR, http://www.npr.org/2013/02/04/170482802/are-mini-reactors-the-future-of-nuclear-power
The U.S. government is investing millions of dollars in what it considers 
AND
the ground, but ultimately the reactors need to be mass-produced.
1 million to high tech nuclear stuff
