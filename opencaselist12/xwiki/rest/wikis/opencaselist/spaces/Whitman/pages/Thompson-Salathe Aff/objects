==Solvency==

====Plan: The United States federal government should substantially increase loan guarantees for the expansion of nuclear power in the United States====

===Solvency – Loan Guarantees===

====Loan Guarantees overcomes financial barriers – key hurdle====
Kassia **Yanosek**, entrepreneur-in-residence at Stanford University~~~’s Steyer-Taylor Center for Energy Policy and Finance and a private equity investor in the energy sector as a principal at Quadrant Management and Founder of Tana Energy Capital LLC, Spring **2012**, &amp;#34; Financing Nuclear Power in the US&amp;#34;, energyclub.stanford.edu/index.php/Journal/Financing_Nuclear_Power_by_Kassia_Yanosek
Over the course of the last decade, it appeared that concerns about carbon emissions
AND
of tax credits and loan guarantees provided in the 2005 Energy Policy Act. 

====Makes nuclear competitive – nuclear plants are cheap to operate====
Charles **Ferguson**, president of the Federation of American Scientists, November **2011**, &amp;#34;JAPAN MELTED DOWN. BUT THAT DOESN~~~’T MEAN THE END OF THE ATOMIC AGE,&amp;#34; Foreign Policy issue 189, EBSCO 
IN FACT, NUCLEAR POWER plants are relatively cheap to operate. Averaging the costs 
AND
a good deal, once you factor in the risks of climate change.

====Federal signal is key to attracting private capital====
Michael **Scott**, former senior advisor at the Department of Treasury and partner and managing director at Miller Buckfire %26 Co as well as head of the firm~~~’s U.S. Government Advisory practice, 4-20-**2010**, &amp;#34;Statement of Michael D. Scott&amp;#34; Testimony before the Subcommittee on Domestic Policy of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform in the House of Representatives, http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-111hhrg65123/pdf/CHRG-111hhrg65123.pdf
The President and Congress have a very powerful policy tool in Title XVII that is 
AND
application and, significantly, before any closing on a Federal loan guarantee.

==Gas Advantage==

====Natural gas is gaining market dominance – expansion of nuclear power avoids a bridge to nowhere====
Jesse **Jenkins**, director of energy and climate policy at the Breakthrough Institute, previously worked as a Policy and Research Associate at the Renewable Northwest Project, 1-20-**2012**, &amp;#34;Avoiding a Natural Gas Bridge to Nowhere,&amp;#34; The Energy Collective, http://theenergycollective.com/breakthroughinstitut/74658/avoiding-natural-gas-bridge-nowhere
Just as the history of unconventional natural gas production in America was fundamentally shaped by 
AND
just like its past, depends on our willingness to invest in innovation.

====Long term lock in is coming – building up alternatives is key====
Christopher **Jones**, Ciriacy-Wantrup Fellow, University of California-Berkeley, **8-29**-2012, &amp;#34;Natural Gas: Bridge or Dead End?&amp;#34; Huffington Post, http://www.huffingtonpost.com/christopher-f-jones/bridge-or-dead-end_b_1837015.html
Natural gas is often touted as a bridge fuel: an interim step between the 
AND
simply about building a bridge, but also about building off-ramps. 

====Use natural gas as a bridge to nowhere ensures a methane apocalypse – expansion of nuclear reduces the short run magnitude of emissions preventing the climate from crossing short run tipping points. ====
Bill **Chameides**, Dean, Duke University~~~’s Nicholas School of the Environment, 7-20-**2012**, &amp;#34;Natural Gas: A Bridge to a Low-Carbon Future or Not?&amp;#34; Huffington Post, http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bill-chameides/-natural-gas-a-bridge-to_b_1690857.html
Not really, scientists like Bob Howarth of Cornell University, protested. Why? 
AND
will recover once the methane is flushed from the atmosphere? Probably not.

====Controlling methane emissions is more important than CO2 – methane hits us while we are vulnerable. ====
Joe **Romm**, Fellow at American Progress and is the editor of Climate Progress, acting assistant secretary of energy for energy efficiency and renewable energy in 1997, PHD in physics from MIT, 4-9-**2012**, &amp;#34;Natural Gas Is A Bridge To Nowhere Absent A Carbon Price AND Strong Standards To Reduce Methane Leakage&amp;#34;, http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2012/04/09/460384/natural-gas-is-a-bridge-to-nowhere-absent-a-carbon-price-and-strong-standards-to-reduce-methane-leakage/
A new journal article finds that methane leakage greatly undercuts or eliminates entirely the climate 
AND
worse for the climate than coal for at least some period of time.

====Fugitive emissions are large massive – best sources====
David **Lewis**, PHD, staff writer, 12-7-**2010**, &amp;#34;EPA confirms high Natural Gas leakage rates,&amp;#34; The Energy Collective, http://theenergycollective.com/david-lewis/48209/epa-confirms-high-natural-gas-leakage-rates
The latest EPA study confirms that its original &amp;#34;seminal&amp;#34; study of methane leaks 
AND
was using.  EPA clearly states the reference data was bad all along.  

====Methane release is insulated the typical warming debate – unique threat====
**Clean Energy Educational Trust**, energy and environmental analysts, **2001**, &amp;#34;Runaway Methane Global Warming,&amp;#34; Hydrogen NOW%21 Journal, http://www.hydrogen.co.uk/h2_now/journal/articles/3_Methane.htm 
Core samples taken from old ocean sediment layers have been used to trace back in 
AND
CO2 was the cause then the raised temperatures would last a lot longer.

====Rapid climate shifts cause extinction====
Max **Mcclure**, staff writer, 6-7-**2012**, &amp;#34;Earth may be approaching ~~~’tipping point,~~~’ Stanford scientist says,&amp;#34; Stanford University News, http://news.stanford.edu/news/2012/june/earth-tipping-point-060712.html
It~~~’s already established that global biological systems are capable of very rapid, wholesale shifts
AND
yet equipped with a flexible intergovernmental structure necessary to manage for this future.&amp;#34;

====Nuclear build up insulates and diversifies energy production – protects against price spikes====
Christine Todd **Whitman**, former EPA administrator and New Jersey governor, is the co-chair of the Clean and Safe Energy Coalition which promotes the inclusion of nuclear power as part of a clean energy portfolio, 5-9-**2012**, &amp;#34;It~~~’s dangerous to depend on natural gas,&amp;#34; Fortune, http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2012/05/09/christine-whitman-nuclear-energy/
The United States needs an &amp;#34;all of the above&amp;#34; energy strategy that focuses 
AND
if we are to secure a safe and sustainable portfolio of energy resources.

====Price spikes are inevitable and collapse the economy without nuclear power====
Rod **Adams**, gained his nuclear knowledge as a submarine engineer officer and as the founder of a company that tried to develop a market for small, modular reactors from 1993-1999, **8-30**-2012, &amp;#34;Will natural gas prices in North America skyrocket by the end of 2014?&amp;#34; The Energy Collective, http://theenergycollective.com/rodadams/107901/look-out-natural-gas-prices-north-america-will-skyrocket-end-2014?ref=node_other_posts_by
In the publications that I regularly read, it is impossible to avoid noticing that 
AND
spoils as the economy crashes against the rocky shore of high energy prices.

====Stable energy prices are key to manufacturing====
Shelly **Schwartz**, staff writer, 6-20-**2012**, &amp;#34;Can the Natural Gas Sector Save the US Economy?&amp;#34; CNBC, http://www.cnbc.com/id/47280026/Can_the_Natural_Gas_Sector_Save_the_US_Economy
Like most commodities, natural gas has been prone to dramatic price swings for decades
AND
.S. and Canada are now second only to the Middle East.&amp;#34;

====Manufacturing isn~~~’t resilient – could totally collapse====
Arvind **Kaushal et al**, partner with Booz and Co, Thomas Mayor, senior executive advisor, Patricia Riedel, principal at Booz and Co. Fall **2011**, &amp;#34;Manufacturing~~~’s Wake-Up Call&amp;#34; Booz and Co. http://booz.com/media/file/sb64-11306-Manufacturing~~~~~~~’s-Wake-Up-Call.pdf
Both the optimists and the pessimists are partially correct. U.S. manufacturing 
AND
S. manufacturing capabilities could then erode past the point of no return.

====Economic shocks are inevitable – strong domestic manufacturing is key to economic resilience and retaining our innovation leadership====
Michael **Ettlinger**, the Vice President for Economic Policy at the Center for American Progress, former director of the Economic Analysis and Research Network of the Economic Policy Institute, **and** Kate **Gordon**, the Vice President for Energy Policy at the Center for American Progress, April **2011**, &amp;#34;The Importance and Promise of American Manufacturing&amp;#34; ~~~~http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2011/04/pdf/manufacturing.pdf—http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2011/04/pdf/manufacturing.pdf-http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2011/04/pdf/manufacturing.pdf~~~~ 
Manufacturing is critically important to the American economy. For generations, the strength of 
AND
vulnerable to everything from exchange rate fluctuations to trade embargoes to natural disasters.

====No decoupling – US key to global demand and US protectionism kills the global economy====
Desmond **Lachman**, resident fellow at AEI, 11-1-**2007**, &amp;#34;The Global Economic Decoupling Myth,&amp;#34; AEI, http://www.aei.org/article/27052
Not so long ago, the conventional wisdom was that if the U.S
AND
global, as distinct from simply the U.S., economic recovery.

====Economic decline causes global war====
Walter Russell **Mead**, Henry A. Kissinger senior fellow ofU.S. foreign policy at the Council on Foreign Relations, 2-4-**2009**, , The New Republic, &amp;#34;Only Makes You Stronger,&amp;#34; http://www.tnr.com/politics/story.html?id=571cbbb9-2887-4d81-8542-92e83915f5f8%26p=2
So far, such half-hearted experiments not only have failed to work; 
AND
the world economy back on track, we may still have to fight.

====Our theoretical models trump – transitions, future expectations, and diversionary war theory all confirm econ decline causes war====
Jedediah **Royal**, Director of Cooperative Threat Reduction at the U.S. Department of Defense, **2010**, Economic Integration, Economic Signaling and the Problem of Economic Crises, in Economics of War and Peace: Economic, Legal and Political Perspectives, ed. Goldsmith and Brauer, p. 213-215
Less intuitive is how periods of economic decline may increase the likelihood of external conflict
AND
not featured prominently in the economic-security debate and deserves more attention.

====Challengers are building up – manufacturing key to overall military superiority and deterrence====
Mackenzie **Eaglen et al**, American Enterprise Institute, Rebecca Grant, IRIS Research, Robert P. Haffa, Haffa Defense Consulting, Michael O~~~’Hanlon, The Brookings Institution, Peter W. Singer, The Brookings Institution, Martin Sullivan, Commonwealth Consulting, Barry Watts, Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, January **2012,** &amp;#34;The Arsenal of Democracy and How to Preserve It: Key Issues in Defense Industrial Policy, Brookings, http://www.brookings.edu/~~~~/media/research/files/papers/2012/1/26%20defense%20industrial%20base/0126_defense_industrial_base_ohanlon
Yet there are severe challenges that could result to the nation~~~’s security interests even with 
AND
difficulty restoring its ability to build nuclear submarines is a frequently cited example.)

====US decline causes great power wars====
Yuhan **Zhang** is a researcher at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Washington, D.C.; **and** Lin **Shi** is from Columbia University. She also serves as an independent consultant for the Eurasia Group and a consultant for the World Bank in Washington, D.C., 1-22-**2011**, &amp;#34;America~~~’s decline: A harbinger of conflict and rivalry,&amp;#34; http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2011/01/22/americas-decline-a-harbinger-of-conflict-and-rivalry/
Over the past two decades, no other state has had the ability to seriously 
AND
forecast in a future that will inevitably be devoid of unrivalled US primacy.


==Prolif Advantage==

===Yes Rapid Prolif===

====We~~~’re on the brink of rapid prolif – access to tech is inevitable and multilateral institutions fail====
**CFR** 7-5-**2012**, &amp;#34;The Global Nuclear Nonproliferation Regime,&amp;#34; Council on Foreign Relations, http://www.cfr.org/proliferation/global-nuclear-nonproliferation-regime/p18984
Nuclear weapons proliferation, whether by state or nonstate actors, poses one of the 
AND
way for &amp;#34;the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons.&amp;#34;

====Nuclear hedging means proliferation would be rapid====
Mitchell **Reiss**, fmr director of the Reves Center for International Studies, **2004**, &amp;#34;The Nuclear Tipping Point&amp;#34;
Or it may be that countries would not sprint to cross the nuclear finish line 
AND
even years, awaiting a political decision to tip them over the edge.

====Regional prolif causes cascades====
Kurt **Campbell**, senior vice president and director of the International Security Program and Chair in National Security at CSIS, **2004**, &amp;#34;The Nuclear Tipping Point&amp;#34;
A nation~~~’s desire to achieve a balance of military power with it neighbors is another 
AND
upsetting regional relations with the United States, Russia, and South Asia.

====Prolif snowballs – declining cred causes allied prolif====
Matthew **Kroenig**, Professor of Government at Georgetown and Fellow at CFR specializing in Nuclear Security, 5-26-**2012**, &amp;#34;The History of Proliferation Optimism:  Does It Have A Future?&amp;#34; Nonproliferation Policy Education Center, http://www.npolicy.org/article.php?aid=1182andrtid=2
Undermines alliances: The spread of nuclear weapons also complicates U.S. alliance 
AND
destabilizing an already unstable region and threatening Washington~~~’s ability to influence regional dynamics.


===Prolif Bad – Nuke War===

====Prolif incentivizes aggression – that causes regional instability and increased conventional wars which escalate to global nuclear war====
Matthew **Kroenig**, Professor of Government at Georgetown and Fellow at CFR specializing in Nuclear Security, 5-26-**2012**, &amp;#34;The History of Proliferation Optimism:  Does It Have A Future?&amp;#34; Nonproliferation Policy Education Center, http://www.npolicy.org/article.php?aid=1182andrtid=2
Regional instability: The spread of nuclear weapons also emboldens nuclear powers contributing to regional 
AND
strike could very well lead to a wider war in the Middle East. 


===Civilian Nukes Key===

====Civilian nuclear power is key to nuclear leadership – that~~~’s key to control prolif====
Pete **Domenici**, former senator from New Mexico, **and** Warren F. &amp;#34;Pete&amp;#34; **Miller**, part time Research Professor at Texas A %26 M University and former assistant secretary for nuclear energy at the U.S. Department of Energy, July **2012**, &amp;#34;Maintaining U.S. Leadership in Global Nuclear Energy Markets,&amp;#34; Bipartisan Policy Center, http://bipartisanpolicy.org/sites/default/files/Leadership%20in%20Nuclear%20Energy%20Markets.pdf
Nuclear power technologies are distinct from other potential exports in energy or in other sectors 
AND
, could help address concerns about the proliferation of uranium-enrichment capabilities).

====Strong nuclear industry key to global leadership – loan guarantees are critical====
Olga **Belogolova**, staff writer, **7-19**-2012, &amp;#34;U.S. Nuclear Industry Seen Needing a Boost,&amp;#34; National Journal Daily, Lexis. 
A robust nuclear-energy industry should be a high priority for the country~~~’s energy 
AND
were going slowly and they might not be willing to wait any longer.


====New nuclear capacity is vital – slowing investment swamps all alt causes====
Pete **Domenici**, former senator from New Mexico, **and** Warren F. &amp;#34;Pete&amp;#34; **Miller**, part time Research Professor at Texas A %26 M University and former assistant secretary for nuclear energy at the U.S. Department of Energy, July **2012**, &amp;#34;Maintaining U.S. Leadership in Global Nuclear Energy Markets,&amp;#34; Bipartisan Policy Center, http://bipartisanpolicy.org/sites/default/files/Leadership%20in%20Nuclear%20Energy%20Markets.pdf
As the world~~~’s largest commercial nuclear operator and dominant weapons state, the United States 
AND
in domestic nuclear energy activities could erode U.S. international standing.

====Civilian nuclear policy is modeled and spills over to global nuclear leadership====
Scott D. **Sagan**, Professor of Political Science and Co-Director of the Center for International Security and Cooperation at Stanford University, 4-18-**2011**, &amp;#34;The International Security Implications Of U.S. Domestic Nuclear Power Decisions,&amp;#34; http://cybercemetery.unt.edu/archive/brc/20120621005012/http://brc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/sagan_brc_paper_final.pdf
Reasonable people may well disagree about the value of specific policy proposals regarding nuclear power 
AND
fully appreciate how much our policies influence the decisions made by foreign governments.

====Avoiding short term tipping points is key – short run factors determine if we can stabilize in the long run. ====
Nina **Rohbein**, staff writer, 5-25-**2012**, &amp;#34;Methane leakage ~’overshadows~’ shale gas climate benefits,&amp;#34; I%26PE, http://www.ipe.com/guest/methane-leakage-overshadows-shale-gas-climate-benefits_45687.php~~%23.UC7EN91lTYw
The leakage of greenhouse gas methane is clouding the climate benefits resulting from the expansion 
AND
letting much of the benefit of switching from coal to gas slip away.

===AT: Engineer Shortages===

====New programs mean sufficient engineers for the plan====
**World Nuclear News**, 8-23-**2012**, &amp;#34;More options open for US workforce,&amp;#34; WNN, http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NP-More_options_open_for_US_workforce-2308127.html-http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NP-More_options_open_for_US_workforce-2308127.html

Matt **Ridley**, staff writer, 8-17-**2012**, &amp;#34;Apocalypse Not: Here~’s Why You Shouldn~’t Worry About End Times,&amp;#34; Wired, http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/08/ff_apocalypsenot/all/
The truth is, a new global pandemic is growing less likely, not more
AND
genome and devise a vaccine or cure is getting better all the time.


==Prolif==

===Yes Escalation – New Crises===

====New reactors will be light water reactors – only tech feasible commercially====
David **Hill et al**, Laboratory Director for Science and Technology at the Idaho National Lab, Michael Sellman, president and CEO of Nuclear Management Co. and Chairman of Idaho National Lab Utility Advisory Board, Mano Nazar, Senior VP and Nuclear COO of Florida Power and Light Co. and Chairman of the EPRJ Nuclear Power Council, 5-28-**2010**, &amp;#34;Idaho National Laboratory/Nuclear Power Industry Strategic Plan for Light Water Reactor Research and Development,&amp;#34; INL, www.inl.gov/technicalpublications/Documents/3881540.pdf 
This strategy supports the drive for nuclear power growth by focusing on LWRs, which

Loan guarantees are important to the nuclear industry because the currently available models are large
AND
government on the hook for delays that come from bad bureaucratic decision making.

====Federal credit is key to keep loans low cost – low interest rates and diverse portfolios====
John **Griffith**, Policy Analyst with the Economic Policy Team at the Center for American Progress, **and** Richard **Caperton**, Director of Clean Energy Investment at the Center for American Progressed, 5-3-**2012**, &amp;#34;Major Analysis: Federal Loans And Loan Guarantees Have A Huge Benefit But A Low And Predicatable Cost,&amp;#34; ThinkProgress, http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2012/05/03/475978/major-analysis-federal-loans-and-loan-guarantees-have-a-huge-benefit-but-a-low-and-predicatable-cost/?mobile=nc
The federal government is in a unique position to issue these loans and guarantees for

to limit risks by regulating markets and ensuring compliance from lenders and borrowers.

====Federal credit is key to keep loans low-risk====
Karl **Smith**, Assistant Professor of Public Economics at University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, 4-12-**2012**, &amp;#34;In Praise of Federal Loan Guarantees (Yep, Just Like Solyndra~’s)&amp;#34; The Atlantic, http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/04/in-praise-of-federal-loan-guarantees-yep-just-like-solyndras/255721/

As should be abundantly clear, we are far from exhausting our raw material resources
AND
of important raw materials they have more years of consumption left than before. 


====We won~’t run out of non-renewable resources====
Bjorn Lomborg, Associate Professor, Department of Political Science, University of Aarhus, 2001, Environmental Conflict, p. 140-142
The concern for running our of resources not only applies to energy but also the 
AND
has quadrupled since 1950, and yet the price has been dropping slightly.

===2AC Obama Good===

====Romney wins – up in the swing states====
Susan **Page**, for USA Today, **10-15**-2012, &amp;#34;Swing States poll: Women push Romney into lead,&amp;#34; USA Today, http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2012/10/15/swing-states-poll-women-voters-romney-obama/1634791/
9:06PM EDT October 15. 2012 - WASHINGTON — Mitt Romney leads President 
AND
voters, 48%-49%, and leads by 8 points among men.


====Romney~’s surging on favorable and Obama~’s crashing====
Andrew **Sullivan**, editor in chief of the Daily Dish and noted writer for Newsweek, The New Republic, and The Atlantic, **10-19**-2012, &amp;#34;Romney~’s Net Favorables Now Exceed Obama~’s,&amp;#34; The Daily Dish, http://andrewsullivan.thedailybeast.com/2012/10/romneys-net-favorables-now-exceed-obamas.html 
It increasingly seems clear to me that the first debate~’s impact on Romney~’s personal image 
AND
. In the Electoral College vote, here~’s what Princeton has right now:


====Public loves nukes====
**WNA**, World Nuclear Association, August **2012**, &amp;#34;US Nuclear Power Policy,&amp;#34; http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf41_US_nuclear_power_policy.html
Public opinion regarding nuclear power has generally been fairly positive, and has grown more 
AND
and job creation; and 77% associate nuclear energy and clean air.

====Obama already increased loan guarantees for nuclear reactors====
Jennifer **Bendery**, writer for the Huffington Post, 2-14-**2012**, &amp;#34;Obama~’s Budget Nixes New Money For Program That Funded Solyndra&amp;#34; http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/14/obama-budget-solyndra-program_n_1276605.html
Obama has regularly included huge increases to the program~’s loan guarantee authority in his budget, though Congress has not approved his proposals. He provided a %2436 billion increase for nuclear reactors in his 2011 budget, and again in his 2012 budget. He also included %24200 million in credit subsidies for renewable and energy efficiency projects in his 2012 budget. This year, he provided nothing.

====National gas prices will stay high====
Anthony **Karge**, writer for the Cheshire Patch, **10-9**-2012, &amp;#34;Small Gas Price Drop In Connecticut, National Average Up&amp;#34; http://cheshire.patch.com/articles/small-gas-price-drop-in-connecticut-national-average-up-5b59cb27
The national gas price average went up in the past week, but the state~’s 
AND
where the average now stands 88c/gal higher than a year ago.&amp;#34;

====Thumps the election====
Tom **Whipple** is a retired government analyst and has been following the peak oil issue for several years. 8-29-**2012** http://www.fcnp.com/commentary/national/12495-the-peak-oil-crisis-summers-end.html
As the US Presidential election moves into high gear, it is conventional wisdom that 
AND
region without interrupting the region~’s oil exports is likely to become increasingly difficult.



====No link – plan doesn~’t happen till after the election====
David **Lightman** **and** William **Douglas** **9-21**-2012, &amp;#34;Unproductive Congress breaks until after November election&amp;#34;, http://www.adn.com/2012/09/20/2633147/unproductive-congress-breaks-until.html_
Lawmakers spent Thursday pointing fingers and charging opponents with cynical political posturing. Among Congress~’ 
AND
to Sept. 10. Congress is expected to return Nov. 13.

====Other factors cancel each other out – only the economy matters====
Mano **Singham**, PHD, theoretical physicist and director of UCITE, at U Cleveland,** 3-8**-2012, &amp;#34;What really matters in predicting presidential election outcomes,&amp;#34; Free Thoughts Blog, http://freethoughtblogs.com/singham/2012/03/08/what-really-matters-in-predicting-presidential-election-outcomes/
A political scientist colleague of mine who tracks these things closely says that what they 
AND
uproar, there is likely another who it drives to the Republican camp.

====Winners win====
Robert **Creamer**, political strategist for over four decades, 12-23-**2011**, &amp;#34;Why GOP Collapse on the Payroll Tax Could be a Turning Point Moment,&amp;#34; Huffington Post, www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-creamer/why-gop-collapse-on-the-p_b_1167491.html
2). Strength and victory are enormous political assets. Going into the New Year
AND
you have them on the run - that~’s the time to chase them.

===AT:  Russia===

====Romney wont tank relations – will shift to reconciliation====
Eugene **Ivanov**, political commentator, 10-19-**2011**, &amp;#34;Mitt Romney: The no-apology candidate,&amp;#34; Russia Beyond the Headline, http://rbth.ru/articles/2011/10/19/mitt_romney_the_no-apology_candidate_13598.html
It would be premature, however, to conclude that Romney~’s current position vis-
AND
Putin and look into his soul? And make no apology for that.

====Relations resilient and no risk of war – cold war proves====
Richard Weitz, staff writer, 9-27-2011, &amp;#34;Global Insights: Putin not a Game-Changer for U.S.-Russia Ties,&amp;#34; World Politics Review, http://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/10140/global-insights-putin-not-a-game-changer-for-u-s-russia-ties-http://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/10140/global-insights-putin-not-a-game-changer-for-u-s-russia-ties
Fifth, there will inevitably be areas of conflict between Russia and the United States 
AND
of social communication, that will constrain whoever is in charge of Russia.

===AT:  China Trade===

====No retaliation====
Robert **Scott**, Economic Policy Institute, 10-7-**2011**,
http://www.epi.org/blog/currency-legislation-lead-trade-war-china/
On Wednesday, Senator Orrin Hatch claimed that the Currency Exchange Rate and Oversight Reform 
AND
income families in China, who are very dependent on these basic commodities.

====No risk====
David **Rothkopf**, staff writer, 11-15-**2011**, &amp;#34;10 Reasons Why Obama Will Win in 2012,&amp;#34; FP, http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/11/15/10_reasons_why_obama_will_win_in_2012
It is possible that some of the views that were offered by likely nominee Mitt 
AND
what happens between now and when the next president takes office will be. 

====Romney~’s China policies would have no practical effect====
Daniel W. **Drezner**, Professor of International Politics at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, 5-25-**2012**, &amp;#34;Romney: Year One&amp;#34; http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/05/25/romney_year_one?page=full
DAY 1: The first day of a Romney presidency brings two major shifts in 
AND
what happened when George W. Bush became president in 2001. Yawn.

===2AC China Grid Add On===

====Nuclear expansion key to grid stability====
Margaret **Harding**, president of 4Factor Consulting. She has worked in the nuclear industry for more than 30 years and advises clients on quality, regulatory, technical, and business issues within the nuclear industry, 2-8-**2012**, &amp;#34;Role of nuclear energy in creating smarter US grid networks,&amp;#34; Nuclear Energy Insider, http://analysis.nuclearenergyinsider.com/operations-maintenance/role-nuclear-energy-creating-smarter-us-grid-networks
Nuclear consultant, Margaret Harding, offers her insights into how smart grid technologies can 
AND
anchor points in regional grid structures that can keep power delivery to consumers.


====Grid vulnerability allow China to launch cyberattacks and invade Taiwan====
The next world war might not start with a bang, but with a blackout
AND
don~’t know,&amp;#34; Lewis says. &amp;#34;And I don~’t like that answer.&amp;#34;

====Extinction====
**Straits Times** (Singapore), June 25, **2000**, No one gains in war over Taiwan
THE high-intensity scenario postulates a cross-strait war escalating into a full
AND
should that come to pass, we would see the destruction of civilisation. 

====CP can~’t solve because states mean no coherent grid strategy, which increases vulnerability====

===2AC Nuclear Expertise – Nuclear Terror===

====New nukes boosts nuclear expertise====
**APS** (American Physical Society), Report from the APS Panel on Public Affairs Committee on Energy and Environment, June **2008**, Readiness of the U.S. Nuclear Workforce for 21st Century Challenges, http://www.aps.org/policy/reports/popa-reports/upload/Nuclear-Readiness-Report-FINAL-2.pdf
The 21st century has brought a growing realization that it is time to reexamine the 
AND
university reactors has dwindled from 63 to 25 during essentially the same period.

====Key to nuclear forensics====
Dr.** Mtingwa**, Chair of the POPA study on the Readiness of the U.S. Nuclear Workforce for 21st Century Challenges. He is an accelerator physicist and Senior Lecturer at MIT, January **2009** &amp;#34;Readiness of the U.S. Nuclear Workforce for 21st Century Challenges,&amp;#34; January, http://www.aps.org/units/fps/newsletters/200901/mtingwa.cfm)
On another front, the tragedy of September 11, 2001, has brought an 
AND
as exciting areas of research that present intellectually and financially rewarding career paths.

====Effective nuclear forensics deters terrorism====
**Talmadge**, IR %26 Government Prof-George Washington, PhD-MIT, Spring **2007**, &amp;#34;Deterring a Nuclear 9/11,&amp;#34; www.twq.com/07spring/docs/07spring_talmadge.pdf
Because terrorists lack return addresses, analysts have dismissed even more firmly the possibility of 
AND
or passively assist terrorists in a nuclear attack on the United States.20 


====Global nuclear war====
Robert **Ayson**, Professor of Strategic Studies and Director of the Centre for Strategic Studies: New Zealand at the Victoria University of Wellington, **2010**, &amp;#34;After a Terrorist Nuclear Attack: Envisaging Catalytic Effects,&amp;#34; Studies in Conflict %26 Terrorism, Volume 33, Issue 7, July, Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via InformaWorld)
A terrorist nuclear attack, and even the use of nuclear weapons in response by 
AND
for the terrorists. This might not help the chances of nuclear restraint.


====CP doesn~’t solve because nuclear forensics is a federal program so federal investment in nuclear energy best fosters spillover of workers====

==1AC==

===Plan===


====The United States federal government should increase loan guarantees for nuclear power in the United States.====

===Gas Advantage===

====Natural gas is gaining market dominance – expansion of nuclear power avoids a bridge to nowhere====
Jesse **Jenkins**, director of energy and climate policy at the Breakthrough Institute, previously worked as a Policy and Research Associate at the Renewable Northwest Project, 1-20-**2012**, &amp;#34;Avoiding a Natural Gas Bridge to Nowhere,&amp;#34; The Energy Collective, http://theenergycollective.com/breakthroughinstitut/74658/avoiding-natural-gas-bridge-nowhere
Just as the history of unconventional natural gas production in America was fundamentally shaped by 
AND
just like its past, depends on our willingness to invest in innovation.

====Long term lock in is coming – building up alternatives is key====
Christopher **Jones**, Ciriacy-Wantrup Fellow, University of California-Berkeley, 8-29-**2012**, &amp;#34;Natural Gas: Bridge or Dead End?&amp;#34; Huffington Post, http://www.huffingtonpost.com/christopher-f-jones/bridge-or-dead-end_b_1837015.html
Natural gas is often touted as a bridge fuel: an interim step between the 
AND
simply about building a bridge, but also about building off-ramps. 


====Using natural gas as a bridge to nowhere ensures a methane apocalypse – expansion of nuclear reduces the short run magnitude of emissions preventing the climate from crossing short run tipping points. ====
Bill **Chameides**, Dean, Duke University~’s Nicholas School of the Environment, 7-20-**2012**, &amp;#34;Natural Gas: A Bridge to a Low-Carbon Future or Not?&amp;#34; Huffington Post, http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bill-chameides/-natural-gas-a-bridge-to_b_1690857.html
Not really, scientists like Bob Howarth of Cornell University, protested. Why? 
AND
will recover once the methane is flushed from the atmosphere? Probably not.

====Controlling methane emissions is more important than CO2 – methane hits us while we are vulnerable. ====
Joe **Romm**, Fellow at American Progress and is the editor of Climate Progress, acting assistant secretary of energy for energy efficiency and renewable energy in 1997, PHD in physics from MIT, 4-9-**2012**, &amp;#34;Natural Gas Is A Bridge To Nowhere Absent A Carbon Price AND Strong Standards To Reduce Methane Leakage&amp;#34;, http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2012/04/09/460384/natural-gas-is-a-bridge-to-nowhere-absent-a-carbon-price-and-strong-standards-to-reduce-methane-leakage/
A new journal article finds that methane leakage greatly undercuts or eliminates entirely the climate 
AND
worse for the climate than coal for at least some period of time.

====Methane release is insulated from the typical warming debate – unique threat====
**Clean Energy Educational Trust**, energy and environmental analysts, **2001**, &amp;#34;Runaway Methane Global Warming,&amp;#34; Hydrogen NOW%21 Journal, http://www.hydrogen.co.uk/h2_now/journal/articles/3_Methane.htm 
Core samples taken from old ocean sediment layers have been used to trace back in 
AND
CO2 was the cause then the raised temperatures would last a lot longer.

====Rapid climate shifts cause extinction====
Max **Mcclure**, staff writer, 6-7-**2012**, &amp;#34;Earth may be approaching ~’tipping point,~’ Stanford scientist says,&amp;#34; Stanford University News, http://news.stanford.edu/news/2012/june/earth-tipping-point-060712.html
It~’s already established that global biological systems are capable of very rapid, wholesale shifts
AND
yet equipped with a flexible intergovernmental structure necessary to manage for this future.&amp;#34;


====Price spikes are inevitable====
Rod **Adams**, Publisher of Atomic insights. Was in the Navy for 33 years. Spent time at the Naval Academy. Has experience designing and running small nuclear plants, 1-13-**2013**, &amp;#34;Correcting a journalist~’s excessive pessimism about US nuclear industry prospects,&amp;#34; Atomic Insights, http://atomicinsights.com/2013/01/correcting-a-journalists-excessive-pessimism-about-us-nuclear-industry-prospects.html
Though we are all having some difficulty competing against today~’s North American natural gas prices
AND
American markets. That is a simple concept that nearly everyone should understand.

====Stable energy prices are key to manufacturing====
Shelly **Schwartz**, staff writer, 6-20-**2012**, &amp;#34;Can the Natural Gas Sector Save the US Economy?&amp;#34; CNBC, http://www.cnbc.com/id/47280026/Can_the_Natural_Gas_Sector_Save_the_US_Economy
Like most commodities, natural gas has been prone to dramatic price swings for decades
AND
.S. and Canada are now second only to the Middle East.&amp;#34;


====Manufacturing isn~’t resilient – could totally collapse====
Arvind **Kaushal et al**, partner with Booz and Co, Thomas Mayor, senior executive advisor, Patricia Riedel, principal at Booz and Co. Fall **2011**, &amp;#34;Manufacturing~’s Wake-Up Call&amp;#34; Booz and Co. http://booz.com/media/file/sb64-11306-Manufacturing~~~’s-Wake-Up-Call.pdf
Both the optimists and the pessimists are partially correct. U.S. manufacturing 
AND
S. manufacturing capabilities could then erode past the point of no return.


====Challengers are building up – manufacturing key to overall military superiority and deterrence====
Mackenzie **Eaglen et al**, American Enterprise Institute, Rebecca Grant, IRIS Research, Robert P. Haffa, Haffa Defense Consulting, Michael O~’Hanlon, The Brookings Institution, Peter W. Singer, The Brookings Institution, Martin Sullivan, Commonwealth Consulting, Barry Watts, Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, January **2012,** &amp;#34;The Arsenal of Democracy and How to Preserve It: Key Issues in Defense Industrial Policy, Brookings, http://www.brookings.edu/~~/media/research/files/papers/2012/1/26%20defense%20industrial%20base/0126_defense_industrial_base_ohanlon
Yet there are severe challenges that could result to the nation~’s security interests even with 
AND
difficulty restoring its ability to build nuclear submarines is a frequently cited example.)


====Heg solves extinction====
Stephen Brooks et. al., associate prof of government at Dartmouth, William Wohlforth, prof of government at Dartmouth at Dartmouth, and John **Ikenberry et al**, Prof of politics and International Affairs at Princeton, Jan/Feb **2013**, &amp;#34;Lead Forward,&amp;#34; Foreign Affairs, Vol. 92 Issue 1, p130-142, 13p, 1, Ebsco. 
Of course, even if it is true that the costs of deep engagement fall 
AND
international cooperation easier. Charting a different course would threaten all these benefits.


====Nuclear build up insulates and diversifies energy production – protects against price spikes====
Christine Todd **Whitman**, former EPA administrator and New Jersey governor, is the co-chair of the Clean and Safe Energy Coalition which promotes the inclusion of nuclear power as part of a clean energy portfolio, 5-9-**2012**, &amp;#34;It~’s dangerous to depend on natural gas,&amp;#34; Fortune, http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2012/05/09/christine-whitman-nuclear-energy/
The United States needs an &amp;#34;all of the above&amp;#34; energy strategy that focuses 
AND
if we are to secure a safe and sustainable portfolio of energy resources. 

===Prolif Advantage===

====Nuclear leadership is declining – only revitalizing the nuclear industry gives us bargaining position and solves prolif ====
Michael **Wallace** **and** Sarah **Williams**, Michael is Senior Adviser at the U.S. Nuclear Energy Project at CSIS, Sarah is a Nuclear Policy Analyst at the Partnership for Global Security at CSIS, &amp;#34;Nuclear Energy in America: Preventing its Early Demise&amp;#34;, October **2012**, http://csis.org/files/publication/120417_gf_wallace_williams.pdf-http://csis.org/files/publication/120417_gf_wallace_williams.pdf
America~’s nuclear energy industry is in decline. Low natural gas prices, financing hurdles
AND
.S. nuclear industry and take action to prevent its early demise.

====Strong nuclear industry key to global leadership – loan guarantees are critical====
Olga **Belogolova**, staff writer, **7-19**-2012, &amp;#34;U.S. Nuclear Industry Seen Needing a Boost,&amp;#34; National Journal Daily, Lexis. 
A robust nuclear-energy industry should be a high priority for the country~’s energy 
AND
were going slowly and they might not be willing to wait any longer.


====Prolif incentivizes aggression – that causes regional instability and increased conventional wars which escalate to global nuclear war====
Matthew **Kroenig**, Professor of Government at Georgetown and Fellow at CFR specializing in Nuclear Security, 5-26-**2012**, &amp;#34;The History of Proliferation Optimism:  Does It Have A Future?&amp;#34; Nonproliferation Policy Education Center, http://www.npolicy.org/article.php?aid=1182andrtid=2
Regional instability: The spread of nuclear weapons also emboldens nuclear powers contributing to regional 
AND
strike could very well lead to a wider war in the Middle East. 


====New prolif causes crises – learning curves and past luck====
Francois **Heisbourg**, Chairman of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, 4-4-**2012**, &amp;#34;NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION – LOOKING BACK, THINKING AHEAD: HOW BAD WOULD THE FURTHER SPREAD OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS BE?&amp;#34; Nonproliferation Policy Education Center, http://www.npolicy.org/article.php?aid=1171andrtid=2
Nuclear archives, as other sensitive governmental archives, open up usually after an interval 
AND
serious risks occurring on several occasions since the mid-1980s(17).

====Future prolif will be rapid – tech diffusion speeds up the process====
**CFR** 7-5-**2012**, &amp;#34;The Global Nuclear Nonproliferation Regime,&amp;#34; Council on Foreign Relations, http://www.cfr.org/proliferation/global-nuclear-nonproliferation-regime/p18984
Nuclear weapons proliferation, whether by state or nonstate actors, poses one of the 
AND
way for &amp;#34;the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons.&amp;#34;


====Prolif begets prolif – history proves ====
Matthew **Kroenig**, Professor of Government at Georgetown and Fellow at CFR specializing in Nuclear Security, 5-26-**2012**, &amp;#34;The History of Proliferation Optimism:  Does It Have A Future?&amp;#34; Nonproliferation Policy Education Center, http://www.npolicy.org/article.php?aid=1182andrtid=2
Further proliferation.  Nuclear proliferation poses an additional threat to international peace and security because 
AND
, giving us all good reason to fear the spread of nuclear weapons. 

====Civilian nuclear power is key to nuclear leadership – that~’s key to control prolif====
Pete **Domenici**, former senator from New Mexico, **and** Warren F. &amp;#34;Pete&amp;#34; **Miller**, part time Research Professor at Texas A %26 M University and former assistant secretary for nuclear energy at the U.S. Department of Energy, July **2012**, &amp;#34;Maintaining U.S. Leadership in Global Nuclear Energy Markets,&amp;#34; Bipartisan Policy Center, http://bipartisanpolicy.org/sites/default/files/Leadership%20in%20Nuclear%20Energy%20Markets.pdf
Nuclear power technologies are distinct from other potential exports in energy or in other sectors 
AND
, could help address concerns about the proliferation of uranium-enrichment capabilities).


====Increased prolif ensures nuclear terrorism====
Matthew **Kroenig**, Professor of Government at Georgetown and Fellow at CFR specializing in Nuclear Security, 5-26-**2012**, &amp;#34;The History of Proliferation Optimism:  Does It Have A Future?&amp;#34; Nonproliferation Policy Education Center, http://www.npolicy.org/article.php?aid=1182andrtid=2
Nuclear terrorism. The spread of nuclear weapons also increases the risk of nuclear terrorism
AND
in authority forced us to worry about the fate of Iran~’s nuclear arsenal. 


====Nuclear terror causes retal – global escalation====
Robert **Ayson**, Professor of Strategic Studies and Director of the Centre for Strategic Studies: New Zealand at the Victoria University of Wellington, **2010**, &amp;#34;After a Terrorist Nuclear Attack: Envisaging Catalytic Effects,&amp;#34; Studies in Conflict %26 Terrorism, Volume 33, Issue 7, July, Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via InformaWorld)
A terrorist nuclear attack, and even the use of nuclear weapons in response by 
AND
for the terrorists. This might not help the chances of nuclear restraint.

====It causes the same causalities as full scale nuke war ====
O. B. **Toon, et al.** department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, U Colorado Boulder, 4-19-**2007**, &amp;#34;Atmospheric effects and societal consequences of regional scale nuclear conﬂicts and acts of individual nuclear terrorism,&amp;#34; Atmos. Chem. Phys., 7, 1973-2002. 
To an increasing extent, people are congregating in the world~’s great urban centers, 
AND
should be carried out as well for the present scenarios and physical outcomes.



===Solvency===

====Loan guarantees spur massive capitalization but squo program is underfunded====
**Institute for 21st Century Energy**, Mission of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Institute for 21st Century Energy is to unify policymakers, regulators, business leaders, and the American public behind a common sense energy strategy to help keep America secure, prosperous, and clean, &amp;#34;Commit to and Expand Nuclear Energy Use&amp;#34;, **2011** is copyright date, www.energyxxi.org/commit-and-expand-nuclear-energy-use
Nuclear power is currently an emissions-free source of 20% of America~’s electricity 
AND
time merged with the Clean Energy Bank of the United States discussed earlier. 

====Loan Guarantees overcomes financial barriers – key hurdle====
Kassia **Yanosek**, entrepreneur-in-residence at Stanford University~’s Steyer-Taylor Center for Energy Policy and Finance and a private equity investor in the energy sector as a principal at Quadrant Management and Founder of Tana Energy Capital LLC, Spring **2012**, &amp;#34; Financing Nuclear Power in the US&amp;#34;, energyclub.stanford.edu/index.php/Journal/Financing_Nuclear_Power_by_Kassia_Yanosek
Over the course of the last decade, it appeared that concerns about carbon emissions
AND
of tax credits and loan guarantees provided in the 2005 Energy Policy Act. 

====Makes nuclear competitive – nuclear plants are cheap to operate====
Charles **Ferguson**, president of the Federation of American Scientists, November **2011**, &amp;#34;JAPAN MELTED DOWN. BUT THAT DOESN~’T MEAN THE END OF THE ATOMIC AGE,&amp;#34; Foreign Policy issue 189, EBSCO 
IN FACT, NUCLEAR POWER plants are relatively cheap to operate. Averaging the costs 
AND
a good deal, once you factor in the risks of climate change.

====State incentives fail – capital costs too high====
Ben Moshe, et al 2011 ~~Kelley Michael Gale is the Finance Department Chair 
AND
P. Rosenblatt, and Kelly D. Thomason**, p. google~~ 
A primary reason why the financing of a nuclear power project may resemble a Mega
AND
these financings, taking a seat at the table to customize each transaction.
