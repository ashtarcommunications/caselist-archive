The United States federal government should fully fund contract support costs under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975.
Solves the case – supporting effective native governance is the vital internal link to self-determination and economic self-sufficiency. It’s also a pre-req to effective natural resource use

The affirmative’s call for renewables for Native Americans is neoliberal green-washing—the program is a ruse for corporate access to energy resources—turns the case
Brian Awehali, Free-lance journalist specializing in capitalism, published in dozens of magazines, 2006, “NATIVE ENERGY FUTURES: Renewable Energy and the New Rush on Indian Lands,” http://loudcanary.com/2006/06/05/native-energy-futures/
It all started with a single 750kW wind turbine built by the Rosebud Sioux in 
AND
the state’s largest tribal corporation, and the single largest company in Alaska. 
The aff is just opening the door to a new energy rush—tribal sovereignty is a smokescreen for cyclical violence and exploitation.

Reject their “takes the beads” logic cause it’s racist and turns self-determination

Some have persuasively argued that many modern Indian development schemes are designed to enrich non

than stifle, tribal economies in light of the troubling context described above.

The United States federal government should establish a revenue neutral carbon tax system for carbon emissions in the United States. The federal government should reduce the corporate income tax and business capital-gains taxes. The United States federal government should phase out all energy subsidies.
The United States Federal Government should provide infrastructure that includes and interconnects computational science software sustainability centers, data and software repositories, and high-end computing leadership centers with each other and with researchers.
Targeting specific industries and technology fails—-carbon tax is key to market-based solutions that solve the case better

Morris et al, Fellow and Deputy Director of the, Climate and Energy Economics project at Brookings, 6-4-2012, &amp;#34;CLEAN ENERGY:REVISITING THE CHALLENGES OF INDUSTRIAL POLICY,&amp;#34; www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2012/6/04%20clean%20energy%20morris%20nivola%20schultze/04_clean_energy_morris_nivola_schultze.pdf
Public investments of these magnitudes, targeted at specific industries, arguably constitute an industrial

market prices that many clean energy subsidies will succeed in deploying new technologies.

Natural gas as a bridge ensures a methane apocalypse

Not really, scientists like Bob Howarth of Cornell University, protested. Why?

Methane release is insulated from the warming debate – unique threat

CO2 was the cause then the raised temperatures would last a lot longer.
Rapid climate shifts cause extinction
