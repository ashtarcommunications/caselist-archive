Government procurement is a powerful tool that can create markets and sustainable energy development on government sites. This solves the aff and allows a phase-out of REC purchases to fulfill renewable energy needs.

But some agencies are trying to buck the trend and reduce their reliance on RECs
AND
from 440,000 to 248,000 megawatt hours, Robyn said.
The plan is a shift in the other direction – the DoD incentivizing instead of owning, building or deploying the project means they still have to rely on the purchase of RECs to meet compliance with DoE regulations.

According to DOD officials, in most cases, private developers are generally ¶ interested

REC reliance causes greenwashing perception – it’s about sending the right message.
Schendler 7

The danger in buying RECs is that the mainstream press has begun to challenge claims

in one masterstroke: a third-party gold standard for REC quality.
That kills DoD credibility on clean tech globally – only a credible strategy means sustainable transition worldwide.

Permutation still creates REC use – any program other than procurement will require REC use.

The best way to address the problems with FEMP’s REC interpretation is¶ to render

For example, when a solar installation produces renewable energy, it produces the energy

PPAs require REC transfers to utilities – that forces REC purchases and usage

Under a PPA, the third-party developer often retains ownership of the¶
