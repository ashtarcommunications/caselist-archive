A terrorist nuclear attack, and even the use of nuclear … use of nuclear weapons by states has been the threat of nuclear retaliation

===Plan Text===
====The plan: The United States federal government should enter into power purchase agreements for nuclear reactors under 300MW.==== 

===Contention 4 is solvency===

====Cost-sharing is necessary but not sufficient to solve – government PPA are vital in transition the market from test level to full commercialization – prefer our comparative evidence from the DOE.====

WASHINGTON — In an effort to encourage nuclear power, Congress voted in 2005 to 
AND
surface any time soon to replace those that have been all but abandoned.
&amp;#34;My gut feeling is that there is going to be a delay,&amp;#34; said Neil Wilmshurst, a vice president of the Electric Power Research Institute, a nonprofit utility consortium based in Palo Alto, Calif. News on Thursday that Exelon Corporation-http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/exelon_corporation/index.html?inline=nyt-org, the nation~’s largest reactor operator, planned to buy a rival, the Constellation Energy Group-http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/constellation_energy_group/index.html?inline=nyt-org, only reinforces the trend; until late last year, Constellation wanted to build, while Exelon was firmly against it.
Mr. Wilmshurst said the continued depressed price ofnatural gas-http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/energy-environment/natural-gas/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier had clouded the economics of new reactors, and he predicted that construction activity would &amp;#34;go quiet&amp;#34; for two to five years. His group has shifted its efforts to helping figure out how existing plants can extend their licenses to 80 years from the current limit of 60.
Of the four nuclear reactor construction projects that the Energy Department identified in 2009 as the most deserving for the loans, two have lost major partners and seem unlikely to recover soon. In addition to low prices for natural gas, the demand for electricity is down, and the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that damaged the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant could bring new rules.
Only %248.8 billion of the 2005 guarantee has been allocated — to a twin reactor project in Georgia. Ground has been broken on the fourth candidate, a twin reactor project in South Carolina, but its sponsors may get a better deal in the commercial finance market.
The initial %2417.5 billion was approved during the Bush administration, but

guarantees even after prospects for such legislation died after last fall~’s midterm elections.
The Republicans, who won control of the House, have portrayed such regulatory legislation as an energy tax. A White House spokesman, Clark Stevens, said that in the president~’s view, nuclear power would continue to be an important part of the &amp;#34;clean energy economy&amp;#34; he was seeking.

Anders Sandberg, James Martin Research Fellow at the Future of Humanity Institute at Oxford University, et al., with Jason G. Matheny, Ph.D. candidate in Health Policy and Management at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and Special Consultant to the Center for Biosecurity at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, and Milan M. Ćirković, Senior Research Associate at the Astronomical Observatory of Belgrade and Assistant Professor of Physics at the University of Novi Sad in Serbia and Montenegro, 2008 (“How can we reduce the risk of human extinction?,” Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, September 8th, Available Online at http://thebulletin.org/web-edition/features/how-can-we-reduce-the-risk-of-human-extinction)
The facts are sobering. More than 99.9 percent of species that have ever existed on Earth have gone extinct. Over the long run, it seems likely that humanity will meet the same fate. In less than a billion years, the increased intensity of the Sun will initiate a wet greenhouse effect, even without any human interference, making Earth inhospitable to life. A couple of billion years later Earth will be destroyed, when it&amp;#39;s engulfed by our Sun as it expands into a red-giant star. If we colonize space, we could survive longer than our planet, but as mammalian species survive, on average, only two million years, we should consider ourselves very lucky if we make it to one billion.  Humanity could be extinguished as early as this century by succumbing to natural hazards, such as an extinction-level asteroid or comet impact, supervolcanic eruption, global methane-hydrate release, or nearby supernova or gamma-ray burst. (Perhaps the most probable of these hazards, supervolcanism, was discovered only in the last 25 years, suggesting that other natural hazards may remain unrecognized.) Fortunately the probability of any one of these events killing off our species is very low—less than one in 100 million per year, given what we know about their past frequency. But as improbable as these events are, measures to reduce their probability can still be worthwhile. For instance, investments in asteroid detection and deflection technologies cost less, per life saved, than most investments in medicine. While an extinction-level asteroid impact is very unlikely, its improbability is outweighed by its potential death toll.  The risks from anthropogenic hazards appear at present larger than those from natural ones. Although great progress has been made in reducing the number of nuclear weapons in the world, humanity is still threatened by the possibility of a global thermonuclear war and a resulting nuclear winter. We may face even greater risks from emerging technologies. Advances in synthetic biology might make it possible to engineer pathogens capable of extinction-level pandemics. The knowledge, equipment, and materials needed to engineer pathogens are more accessible than those needed to build nuclear weapons. And unlike other weapons, pathogens are self-replicating, allowing a small arsenal to become exponentially destructive. Pathogens have been implicated in the extinctions of many wild species. Although most pandemics &amp;#34;fade out&amp;#34; by reducing the density of susceptible populations, pathogens with wide host ranges in multiple species can reach even isolated individuals. The intentional or unintentional release of engineered pathogens with high transmissibility, latency, and lethality might be capable of causing human extinction. While such an event seems unlikely today, the likelihood may increase as biotechnologies continue to improve at a rate rivaling Moore&amp;#39;s Law.  Farther out in time are technologies that remain theoretical but might be developed this century. Molecular nanotechnology could allow the creation of self-replicating machines capable of destroying the ecosystem. And advances in neuroscience and computation might enable improvements in cognition that accelerate the invention of new weapons. A survey at the Oxford conference found that concerns about human extinction were dominated by fears that new technologies would be misused. These emerging threats are especially challenging as they could become dangerous more quickly than past technologies, outpacing society&amp;#39;s ability to control them. As H.G. Wells noted, &amp;#34;Human history becomes more and more a race between education and catastrophe.&amp;#34;  Such remote risks may seem academic in a world plagued by immediate problems, such as global poverty, HIV, and climate change. But as intimidating as these problems are, they do not threaten human existence. In discussing the risk of nuclear winter, Carl Sagan emphasized the astronomical toll of human extinction:  A nuclear war imperils all of our descendants, for as long as there will be humans. Even if the population remains static, with an average lifetime of the order of 100 years, over a typical time period for the biological evolution of a successful species (roughly ten million years), we are talking about some 500 trillion people yet to come. By this criterion, the stakes are one million times greater for extinction than for the more modest nuclear wars that kill &amp;#34;only&amp;#34; hundreds of millions of people. There are many other possible measures of the potential loss—including culture and science, the evolutionary history of the planet, and the significance of the lives of all of our ancestors who contributed to the future of their descendants. Extinction is the undoing of the human enterprise.  There is a discontinuity between risks that threaten 10 percent or even 99 percent of humanity and those that threaten 100 percent. For disasters killing less than all humanity, there is a good chance that the species could recover. If we value future human generations, then reducing extinction risks should dominate our considerations. Fortunately, most measures to reduce these risks also improve global security against a range of lesser catastrophes, and thus deserve support regardless of how much one worries about extinction. These measures include:  Removing nuclear weapons from hair-trigger alert and further reducing their numbers; Placing safeguards on gene synthesis equipment to prevent synthesis of select pathogens; Improving our ability to respond to infectious diseases, including rapid disease surveillance, diagnosis, and control, as well as accelerated drug development; Funding research on asteroid detection and deflection, &amp;#34;hot spot&amp;#34; eruptions, methane hydrate deposits, and other catastrophic natural hazards; Monitoring developments in key disruptive technologies, such as nanotechnology and computational neuroscience, and developing international policies to reduce the risk of catastrophic accidents. 

Libertarianism fails- only a combination of individualism and collectivism works- society will collapse without collectivism, and objectivism is reductionist
Locke, writer for The American Conservative, March 14 2005 p. online
(Robert, “Marxism of the Right” http://www.amconmag.com/2005_03_14/article1.html)
This is no surprise, as libertarianism is basically the Marxism of the Right. If Marxism is the delusion that one can run society purely on altruism and collectivism, then libertarianism is the mirror-image delusion that one can run it purely on selfishness and individualism. Society in fact requires both individualism and collectivism, both selfishness and altruism, to function. Like Marxism, libertarianism offers the fraudulent intellectual security of a complete a priori account of the political good without the effort of empirical investigation. Like Marxism, it aspires, overtly or covertly, to reduce social life to economics. And like Marxism, it has its historical myths and a genius for making its followers feel like an elect unbound by the moral rules of their society.

Non-unqiue – hundreds of other instances of coercion and government control over immigration 

Your argument violates individual dignity because people never elect libertarian leaders- this means the only libertarian government would be authoritarian
Locke, writer for The American Conservative, March 14 2005 p. online
(Robert, “Marxism of the Right” http://www.amconmag.com/2005_03_14/article1.html)
Empirically, most people don’t actually want absolute freedom, which is why democracies don’t elect libertarian governments. Irony of ironies, people don’t choose absolute freedom. But this refutes libertarianism by its own premise, as libertarianism defines the good as the freely chosen, yet people do not choose it. Paradoxically, people exercise their freedom not to be libertarians. The political corollary of this is that since no electorate will support libertarianism, a libertarian government could never be achieved democratically but would have to be imposed by some kind of authoritarian state, which rather puts the lie to libertarians’ claim that under any other philosophy, busybodies who claim to know what’s best for other people impose their values on the rest of us. Libertarianism itself is based on the conviction that it is the one true political philosophy and all others are false. It entails imposing a certain kind of society, with all its attendant pluses and minuses, which the inhabitants thereof will not be free to opt out of except by leaving. 

Freedom is not the only important thing in life
Locke, writer for The American Conservative, March 14 2005 p. online
(Robert, “Marxism of the Right” http://www.amconmag.com/2005_03_14/article1.html)
The most fundamental problem with libertarianism is very simple: freedom, though a good thing, is simply not the only good thing in life. Simple physical security, which even a prisoner can possess, is not freedom, but one cannot live without it. Prosperity is connected to freedom, in that it makes us free to consume, but it is not the same thing, in that one can be rich but as unfree as a Victorian tycoon’s wife. A family is in fact one of the least free things imaginable, as the emotional satisfactions of it derive from relations that we are either born into without choice or, once they are chosen, entail obligations that we cannot walk away from with ease or justice. But security, prosperity, and family are in fact the bulk of happiness for most real people and the principal issues that concern governments.

Property rights don’t come first 
Jeffrey Paul, Professor of Philosophy, Bowling Green State University, READING NOZICK, 1981, p. 9-10. 
Like Scanlon, Judith Jarvis T&amp;#39;homson is skeptical about the possibility of defending the absolutely inviolable character of Nozickian property rights. This skepticism derives from a number of examples in which our intuitions incline us toward the view that the property rights in question may be overridden by other considerations. Thomson then asks what is it, at the margin, which sustains the moral invincibility of a property claim and conversely, what is it that justifies the infringement of a property right when we are morally persuaded to ignore it? Property claims are to be sustained, she argues, when, in addition to having acquired title to an object in suitable ways, we value that object highly. Such claims may be overridden when a life will be lost in the absence of an infringement of rights. This demonstrates, Thomson argues, that rights are derivable from human interests and needs and this in turn suggests that the constraints that rights impose upon redistribution are not as inflexible as Nozick&amp;#39;s deontological conception of them leads him to believe.

Counter interpretation - Financial incentives induce behaviors using cash – that includes power purchasing
Webb 93 – lecturer in the Faculty of Law at the University of Ottawa (Kernaghan, “Thumbs, Fingers, and Pushing on String: Legal Accountability in the Use of Federal Financial Incentives”, 31 Alta. L. Rev. 501 (1993) Hein Online) 

In this paper, &amp;#34;financial incentives&amp;#34; are taken to mean disbursements 18 of public funds or contingent commitments to individuals and organizations, intended to encourage, support or induce certain behaviours in accordance with express public policy objectives. They take the form of grants, contributions, repayable contributions, loans, loan guarantees and insurance, subsidies, procurement contracts and tax expenditures.19 Needless to say, the ability of government to achieve desired behaviour may vary with the type of incentive in use: up-front disbursements of funds (such as with contributions and procurement contracts) may put government in a better position to dictate the terms upon which assistance is provided than contingent disbursements such as loan guarantees and insurance. In some cases, the incentive aspects of the funding come from the conditions attached to use of the monies.20 In others, the mere existence of a program providing financial assistance for a particular activity (eg. low interest loans for a nuclear power plant, or a pulp mill) may be taken as government approval of that activity, and in that sense, an incentive to encourage that type of activity has been created.21 Given the wide variety of incentive types, it will not be possible in a paper of this length to provide anything more than a cursory discussion of some of the main incentives used.22 And, needless to say, the comments made herein concerning accountability apply to differing degrees depending upon the type of incentive under consideration.
By limiting the definition of financial incentives to initiatives where public funds are either disbursed or contingently committed, a large number of regulatory programs with incentive effects which exist, but in which no money is forthcoming,23 are excluded from direct examination in this paper. Such programs might be referred to as indirect incentives. Through elimination of indirect incentives from the scope of discussion, the definition of the incentive instrument becomes both more manageable and more particular. Nevertheless, it is possible that much of the approach taken here may be usefully applied to these types of indirect incentives as well.24 Also excluded from discussion here are social assistance programs such as welfare and ad hoc industry bailout initiatives because such programs are not designed primarily to encourage behaviours in furtherance of specific public policy objectives. In effect, these programs are assistance, but they are not incentives.

Small nuclear reactors will probably be the mechanism that ushers in nuclear power’s renaissance in the U.S.¶ Nuclear plants currently supply about 20 percent of the nation’s electricity and more than 70 percent of our carbon-free energy. But large nuclear plants cost $8 billion to $10 billion and utilities are having second thoughts about how to finance these plants.¶ A small modular reactor (SMR) has several advantages over the conventional 1,000-megawatt plant:¶ 1. It ranges in size from 25 to 140 megawatts, hence only costs about a tenth as much as a large plant.¶ 2. It uses a cookie-cutter standardized design to reduce construction costs and can be built in a factory and shipped to the site by truck, railroad or barge.¶ 3. The major parts can be built in U.S. factories, unlike some parts for the larger reactors that must be fabricated overseas.¶ 4. Because of the factory-line production, the SMR could be built in three years with one-third of the workforce of a large plant.¶ 5. More than one SMR could be clustered together to form a larger power plant complex. This provides versatility in operation, particularly in connection with large wind farms. With the variability of wind, one or more SMRs could be run or shut down to provide a constant base load supply of electricity.¶ 6. A cluster of SMRs should be very reliable. One unit could be taken out of service for maintenance or repair without affecting the operation of the other units. And since they are all of a common design, replacement parts could satisfy all units. France has already proved the reliability of standardized plants.¶ At least half a dozen companies are developing SMRs, including NuScale in Oregon. NuScale is American-owned and its 45-megawatt design has some unique features. It is inherently safe. It could be located partially or totally below ground, and with its natural convection cooling system, it does not rely on an elaborate system of pumps and valves to provide safety. There is no scenario in which a loss-of-coolant accident could occur.
China leverages nuclear industry to lock in regional alliances and arms sales – leads to proliferation.

He is also an Adjunct Professor in the Security Studies Program at Georgetown University and an Adjunct Lecturer in the National Security Studies Program at the Johns Hopkins University, Proliferation Papers, In collaboration with the Atomic Energy Commission (CEA), Summer, 2010, http://www.fas.org/press/_docs/nuclear_energy_revival_20100708.pdf
In the coming decades, China may emerge as a major nuclear power supplier. It has already proven adept at building so-called replication reactors – the CPR-1000 series – based on a French technology transfer agreement. To feed its growing need for uranium, Beijing has forged deals with Kazakhstan and several African states. Beijing has been selling conventional weapons to many African states. Pakistan’s military is caught between a tug-of-war in guarding against India’s growing strength and fighting terrorists and other extremists who are trying to undermine Islamabad. While the architects of the U.S.-India nuclear deal may not have intended to stoke this regional conventional and nuclear arms race, the deal has not done anything to stop it. 69 Also, China has other significant commercial ties with these states. Such ties may form the basis of future nuclear deals. Chinese nuclear vendors may argue that they can build reactors faster and cheaper than Western, Japanese, and Korean vendors. Notably, Beijing would have to receive permission from Paris in order to export the French-derived Chinese reactors. As long as China, which is a newer member of the NSG, supports the highest standards of safety, security, and safeguards for these deals, such developments may be welcome news for electricity production for these states. But in the larger strategic context, China may leverage these ties similar to the way the United States and other major nuclear suppliers have leveraged their deals to sell conventional arms and bind states into security alliances. If this comes to pass, Africa and other developing regions could move down a path of more conventional arms races and potential latent nuclear proliferation.

Coal is exported to China now – Companies are shifting because of the economics of coal in the status quo AND GAS NO LINKS
Orcutt 2/25
(Mike, Staff at the MIT Technology Review, “Coal Demand Falls in the U.S., Rises Everywhere Else” 2013 http://www.technologyreview.com/photogallery/511616/coal-demand-falls-in-the-us-rises-everywhere-else/, JL) 

A glut of cheap natural gas in the United States has recently led utilities to replace some coal-fired electricity generation with that from cleaner-burning gas. But while the domestic coal industry is down, the international market for U.S. coal—especially in Europe and Asia—is booming.¶ According to the International Energy Agency, demand for coal continues to grow everywhere in the world except the United States. Globally, demand grew 4.3 percent in 2011, the most recent year for which there are data.¶ Data from the Energy Information Administration, illustrated in the first chart, show that U.S. coal exports are on the rise. In fact, the U.S.—the world’s second largest producer of coal behind China—exported more in 2011 than in any year except 1981, when the country exported around 112 million tons. Data for the full year of 2012 are not yet available, but through the first three quarters, the U.S. was comfortably on pace to set a new record after having sold nearly 98 million tons on the international market. Much of the recent growth is due to increasing shipments of steam coal, the type burned in power plants.¶ As shown in the second chart, coal producers in the U.S. have had particular recent success selling to Asian and European customers. In both regions, natural gas is much more expensive than it is in the United States. The Netherlands, for example, imported a record 10.8 million tons of American coal in 2011, up from 7.3 million in 2010, and the most since the early 1990s. Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom saw similarly large increases.¶ Between 2009 and 2011, China saw its imports of U.S. coal increase fivefold. India imported 4.5 million tons of U.S. coal in 2011, doubling the amount it bought in 2010. Also purchasing a lot more U.S. coal recently is South Korea, which bought 10.4 million tons in 2011, compared to 2.1 million tons just two years prior.

Despite the low price currently fetched for coal overseas, Eaves said the company expects the international market to improve even as domestic demand for coal recedes. &amp;#34;As we look to the U.S. over the next three to five years, let&amp;#39;s face it, demand&amp;#39;s going to be pretty flat,&amp;#34; he said. &amp;#34;We see exports as a long-term development opportunity.&amp;#34; (Related Interactive: &amp;#34;World Electricity Mix&amp;#34;)

Fearful Women- Carolyn Kizer

Arms and the girl I sing - O rare
 arms that are braceleted and white and bare
 
arms that were lovely Helen&amp;#39;s, in whose name
 Greek slaughtered Trojan. Helen was to blame.
 
Scape-nanny call her; wars for turf
 and profit don&amp;#39;t sound glamorous enough.
 
Mythologize your women! None escape.
 Europe was named from an act of bestial rape:
 
Eponymous girl on bull-back, he intent
 on scattering sperm across a continent.
 
Old Zeus refused to take the rap.
 It&amp;#39;s not his name in big print on the map.
 
But let&amp;#39;s go back to the beginning
 when sinners didn&amp;#39;t know that they were sinning.
 
He, one rib short: she lived to rue it
 when Adam said to God, &amp;#34;She made me do it.&amp;#34;
 
Eve learned that learning was a dangerous thing
 for her: no end of trouble would it bring.
 
An educated woman is a danger.
 Lock up your mate! Keep a submissive stranger
 
like Darby&amp;#39;s Joan, content with church and Kinder,
 not like that sainted Joan, burnt to a cinder.
 
Whether we wield a scepter or a mop
 It&amp;#39;s clear you fear that we may get on top.
 
And if we do -I say it without animus-
 It&amp;#39;s not from you we learned to be magnaminous.

==== The sex that is not one is papered over by the collective forgetting of sexual difference – men and women are forced into subjugating themselves to the phallocentric order as part of their everyday existence ====

**Deutscher 2 - **professor in French philosophy and gender at Northwestern

(Penelope, A Politics of Impossible difference)

 

Irigaray goes on to explain that these rights signify in her mind not a right

AND

they have nothing more to say or do //as women&amp;#34; //(166).

 

**To speak is never neutral and discourse in the public sphere is marked by the collective forgetting of the original starting point of social relations which is the subjugation of the feminine**

**Irigaray 2k4**

(Luce, femme fatale __An ethics of sexual difference__ pg. 10-11)

 

**__In order to distance oneself, must one be able to __**take? To **__speak__**

AND

**__to the power of the maternal-feminie which he diminishes or destroys.__**

 

The logic of phallocentrism structures the debate community- women are forced into the androcentric economy of sameness in order to earn a place in the collegiate debate and the failure to conform drives the exclusion of women from the activity.  The reproduction of the masculine subject position spillsover into your life after debate and supports it’s entrenchment across society

&amp;#39;I don&amp;#39;t usually vote for girl debaters because debate really is a boy&amp;#39;s activity.

AND

expend team resources on her increases, assuming she overcomes the initial obstacles.

==== Argument choice in debates are also reflective of the phallocentric economy of the same- the denial of personal experience and connections to individuals are indicative of the androcentric logic that denies the feminine ====

Eisenberg in 2012
 Particular types of argument choices may affect the way participants experience

AND

in debate that challenge their competitors and judges to a moment of reflexivity. 

==== Collegiate policy debate is a microcosm of the treatment of the feminine in the public sphere - not that difference and identity are not utilized in multiple ways to exclude the body of certain individuals - but there is an undeniable silencing of the feminine perspective that occurs in America today- As one example, the exclusion of females from energy policy making is part of the systematic marginalization of the feminine from the Political- only the affirmative can reverse this process and empower women across a host of social platforms ====

There are two major factors which influence the gender-blindness of energy policy:

aware energy policy, will contribute to the wider goal of women’s empowerment.

==== The forgetting of sexual difference invites the worst genocide in history.   We must recognize our historical place and move beyond the phallocratic roles that structure our society.  This is crucial to overcoming the murderous divides among populations ====

Irigaray 91 - French feminist, philosopher linguist cultural theorist

(Luce, “Equality or Different?” in the Irigaray Reader edited by Margaret Whitford pg. 32-33)

 

Demanding equality, as women, seems to me to be an erroneous expression of

AND

**__mutation, in which life is in danger for a variety of reasons.__** 

==== Our advocacy is that you should embrace the 1ac - we choose to inhabit the silence of policy debate and energy policy and invigorate a politics of sexual difference whose ontological openness disrupts the phallocentrism of debate and energy policymaking ====

==== Deutscher, professor in French philosophy and gender at Northwestern, 2K2 ====

(Penelope, A Politics of Impossible difference pg. 29-30)

**__ __**

**__When Irigaray concludes that the history of western culture has ex­cluded sexual difference, notice__**

**__AND__**

for example. **__This exclusion must be considered the very emblem of phallocentrism__**.

==== The social condition of debate and energy policy making is informed by the explicit and implicit failure to think the question of sexual difference.  Our exposure of the suppression of the potential feminine subjectivity cannot be ossified around squo essentialist notions of gender but must be understood as a bracket whose emptiness must be thought ====

==== Deutscher, professor in French philosophy and gender at Northwestern, 2K2 ====

(Penelope, A Politics of Impossible difference)

 

In chapter 2, we saw the suggestion, based on Irigaray&amp;#39;s linguistic analysis,

AND

the discovery and affirmation of such an advent or event&amp;#34; (6). 

 

==== Our argument is not reducible to different sexes good but must be understand as a starting point for universal challenges to oppression in every manifestation ====

At this moment, there seem to be no simple and straightforward answers to these

AND

**__then relations among women and relations among men would necessarily change as well__**.
