For one speaker addressing the National Congress of American Indians, the Wind gives direction and structure:&#xD;
&#xD;
&amp;#34;In early days we were close to nature. We judged time, weather conditions, and many things by the elements - the good earth, the blue sky, the flying of geese, and the changing winds. We looked to these for guidance and answers. Our prayers and thanksgiving were said to the four winds - to the East, from whence the new day was born; to the South, which sent the warm breeze which gave a feeling of comfort; to the West, which ended the day and brought rest; and to the North, the Mother of winter whose sharp air awakened a time of preparation for the long days ahead. We lived by God&amp;#39;s hand through nature and evaluated the changing winds to tell us or warn us of what was ahead. Today we are again evaluating the changing winds. May we be strong in spirit and equal to our Fathers of another day in reading the signs accurately and interpreting them wisely. May Wah-Kon-Tah, the Great Spirit, look down upon us, guide us, inspire us, and give us courage and wisdom. Above all, may He look down upon us and be pleased.&amp;#34; &#xD;

For Black Elk, it constitutes and mimics the way that time and the planet operate:&#xD;
You have noticed that everything as Indian does is in a circle, and that is because the Power of the World always works in circles, and everything tries to be round..... The Sky is round, and I have heard that the earth is round like a ball, and so are all the stars. The wind, in its greatest power, whirls. Birds make their nest in circles, for theirs is the same religion as ours.... Even the seasons form a great circle in their changing, and always come back again to where they were. The life of a man is a circle from childhood to childhood, and so it is in everything where power moves. &#xD;
(Black Elk Oglala Sioux Holy Man, http://www.ilhawaii.net/~stony/quotes.html ).&#xD;
&#xD;
Many indigenous peoples include the power of wind as part of their creation stories or different story-&#xD;
&#xD;
tellings for their nation, one example of the Hopi nation who tell stories of the relationship between Yaponcha - the wind - (a holy god) and young Hopi men who attempt to manage and control the wind. Their attempt at interfering with the wind leads to massive heat waves. In the end the Hopi fellows would release Yaponcha and reach an agreement with the wind. &#xD;
(story of Yaponcha, http://www.firstpeople.us/FP-Html-Legends/Yaponcha_The_Wind_God-Hopi.html ).&#xD;
&#xD;
The reflections into these ways of knowing about the wind structure our criticism of western relationships to energy and the cosmos. The western mind often gives neither room, validation, nor possibility to the viewpoints of Indigenous peoples especially in the context of the environment. This founds the basis of a false ontological scientific reaction. We must begin to see the possibility that the wind gives to us and is not an object we can manipulate&#xD;

In reverence to the above criticisms made by several native americans about energy policy, we would like to begin the discussion of the question of structures of thinking and liberation. The late Vine Deloria Jr. offers a problem with thinking in today’s society, this is Vine Deloria Jr. 1999:&#xD;

&#xD;
Our criticism of status quo policymaking and energy policy is tied to the very same question that Deloria poses, why can we assume that a mere adjustment in where and how we get our energy can we make productive strides to alter the mentalities that have brought us to the brink of collapse. Our task is not to provide a mere new policy to usurp the current crisis in energy, that crisis has been an ongoing one for centuries. The only thing that changes about that crisis is the form that it takes. We must begin with the fundamental questions of knowledge and our orientations to the world. It is a tale of historical accident and arrogance that we have become intertwined to the belief that Western thinking holds the absolute claim to knowledge, Deloria refutes this and offers a different possibility for thinking, this is Deloria in 1999&#xD;

&#xD;
Example after example … of reality.&#xD;
&#xD;
It is fundamentally insufficient to offer a genuine affirmation of the resolution that merely states that a United States federal government should increase incentives for Wind energy in the United States. One of the downfalls of western thinking is its drive towards abstraction – it is in the context of the Dine nation, the  Western Shoshone nation, the Dakota nations, the Cherokee nations and a litany of other nations inside the geographic United States that energy production happens. To affirm the words of the resolution would merely be substituting old words with new words. &#xD;
&#xD;
We affirm the resolution not as a single idea for a policy action but as a vision of the possibility of new forms of thinking and orienting ourselves towards energy production in the United States. &#xD;
&#xD;
The problem of energy policy is the problem of western interpretation. We affirm a fundamental reorientation toward the topic toward the viewpoints of the multitude of Native American nations instead of the destructive over consumptive habits of western culture. The distinction between an idea and a vision as well as the fundamental tenets of our approach to liberation are best explained by Vine Deloria Jr in 1999&#xD;

&#xD;
The question of the aff is of the survival of the planet – Western thinking’s monological approach to cultural thought endangers any context for an ethical relationship to the planet and places us on the path of collective suicide – expanding the limits of knowledge as affirmed by the 1ac are vital to any ethical relationship to the planet. We are all related – our patterns of thinking must reflect this.&#xD;

&#xD;
The 1ac’s vision enters into the possibility for genuine reflection and dialogue on the structures of western culture. It also fundamentally alters the scientific ontological relationship to the world that destroys the concept of interconnectedness. We are not a refusal of all science but rather open science and thinking to other structures of how reality operates; the result from this openness is the possibility for new ways of engaging the world.&#xD;

Those caveats … on earth.&#xD;
&#xD;
Finally, the question of the types of knowledge we inject is not to judge the truth of native American cosmologies toward the environment, but rather to show the possibility of limitations to western metaphysical inquiry and its relationship to the natural world. Voting affirmative is an act of thinking that makes possible a new series of macronarratives to be highlighted. It changes the terms of the conversation instead of just the words we use.&#xD;

&#xD;
Debate itself is a privilege that we were accustomed to whether it was from highschool in Austin or college in Denton and there are now multiple different entanglements and encounters that debate has brought us to that are both positive and negative. We have been opened to a plethora of knowledge bases that have challenged the restricted confines of where we were when we were first in highschool or college&#xD;
&#xD;
We are in service to debate whether it is interaction with the Dallas urban debate alliance or my weekly coaching sessions Law Magnet – an inner city Dallas school. We believe debate has a positivity that has been overshadowed by its drive to universal condemnations of anything outside of the western canon of logical tradition. We challenge those from our social locations – specifically I am a person of Aztec heritage descent who has to encounter colonialism on a daily basis because of the position of my history. My great grandfather fought alongside Emiliano Zapata for freedom from Mexican government rule over Aztecs. Yet I also must realize my history alongside colonialism for an inherent aspect of being Aztec is recognizing my mixed descent because of Spanish attempts to breed out the Aztecs. &#xD;
&#xD;
There is an importance of the history of Colonialism which is important to the 1ac. This is why we use the concept of a topical vision to undertake that history.&#xD;

For the Dine nation we find that wind is the basis of the living world:
“Nitch’i, meaning wind, air or atmosphere, as conceived by the Navajo, is endowed with powers that are not acknowledged by western culture. Suffusing all of nature, Holy Wind gives life, thought, speech, and the power of motion to all living things and serves as the means of communication between all elements of the living world”. (Mcneley p 1 Holy Wind and Navajo Philosophy, 0816507244).

Further, Wind has an important directional beginning for Dine children as shared by Eloise Hart 

Soon after their birth, Navajo babies are ceremoniously presented to their &amp;#34;parents,&amp;#34; the winds who reside in the North, South, East, and West, who give them a &amp;#34;Little Wind&amp;#34; which, hidden in their earfolds where it cannot be seen, thereafter guides them -  not with words but with thoughts - along the path of harmonious behavior. It reminds them that the life and breath that sustains them is the same life and breath that sustains all living beings; that their intentions and actions are part of the intelligent purpose of larger actions and motions; and that the wind that dwells within them is inextricably entwined with the Holy Wind that encompasses the cosmos. In this way Navajo youngsters come to feel a compassionate responsibility for all of creation. The idea of a Little Wind hidden in our ears is reminiscent of a belief of the Skagit tribes of America&amp;#39;s Northwest, that Wind primarily is a teacher - as is anyone who, like it, imparts kwadhakk, the &amp;#34;voiceless blowing sound&amp;#34; that brings important information or instruction. To these people, the spiritual quality of sound is more important than the information the sound imparts, so if they do not understand something they hear, rather than asking questions they &amp;#34;listen within,&amp;#34; quietly reflecting on the subject until insights come.
Eloise Hart Eloise,  Holy Wind, Holy Spirit, Sunrise magazine, April/May 2001; copyright, 2001

For one speaker addressing the National Congress of American Indians, the Wind gives direction and structure:
&amp;#34;In early days we were close to nature. We judged time, weather conditions, and many things by the elements - the good earth, the blue sky, the flying of geese, and the changing winds. We looked to these for guidance and answers. Our prayers and thanksgiving were said to the four winds - to the East, from whence the new day was born; to the South, which sent the warm breeze which gave a feeling of comfort; to the West, which ended the day and brought rest; and to the North, the Mother of winter whose sharp air awakened a time of preparation for the long days ahead. We lived by God&amp;#39;s hand through nature and evaluated the changing winds to tell us or warn us of what was ahead. Today we are again evaluating the changing winds. May we be strong in spirit and equal to our Fathers of another day in reading the signs accurately and interpreting them wisely. May Wah-Kon-Tah, the Great Spirit, look down upon us, guide us, inspire us, and give us courage and wisdom. Above all, may He look down upon us and be pleased.&amp;#34; 
(Unknown Speaker addressing the National Congress of American Indians in the mid 1960&amp;#39;s, http://www.youngwarriors.net/static/pdf/resources/sacred_teachings/in_the_early_days.pdf ). 

For Black Elk, it constitutes and mimics the way that time and the planet operate:
You have noticed that everything as Indian does is in a circle, and that is because the Power of the World always works in circles, and everything tries to be round..... The Sky is round, and I have heard that the earth is round like a ball, and so are all the stars. The wind, in its greatest power, whirls.

Vine Deloria Jr 1999 Theologian, legal scholar, JD, Ph.D, M.Div, standing rock Sioux, For This Land, 102-105

Example after example … of reality.

It is fundamentally insufficient to offer a genuine affirmation of the resolution that merely states that a United States federal government should increase incentives for Wind energy in the United States. One of the downfalls of western thinking is its drive towards abstraction – it is in the context of the Dine nation, the  Western Shoshone nation, the Dakota nations, the Cherokee nations and a litany of other nations inside the geographic United States that energy production happens. To affirm the words of the resolution would merely be substituting old words with new words. 

We affirm the resolution not as a single idea for a policy action but as a vision of the possibility of new forms of thinking and orienting ourselves towards energy production in the United States. 

The problem of energy policy is the problem of western interpretation. We affirm a fundamental reorientation toward the topic toward the viewpoints of the multitude of Native American nations instead of the destructive over consumptive habits of western culture. The distinction between an idea and a vision as well as the fundamental tenets of our approach to liberation are best explained by Vine Deloria Jr in 1999

The role of the ballot is to affirm an ethics of diversality – to be effective in a post-occidental world one must affirm the potential for an other-thinking or for spaces of legitimate thought outside of Eurocentric ideology.

The 1ac’s vision enters into the possibility for genuine reflection and dialogue on the structures of western culture. It also fundamentally alters the scientific ontological relationship to the world that destroys the concept of interconnectedness. We are not a refusal of all science but rather open science and thinking to other structures of how reality operates; the result from this openness is the possibility for new ways of engaging the world.

Finally, the question of the types of knowledge we inject is not to judge the truth of native American cosmologies toward the environment, but rather to show the possibility of limitations to western metaphysical inquiry and its relationship to the natural world. Voting affirmative is an act of thinking that makes possible a new series of macronarratives to be highlighted. It changes the terms of the conversation instead of just the words we use.

&#xD;
For one speaker addressing the National Congress of American Indians, the Wind gives direction and structure:&#xD;
&#xD;
&amp;#34;In early days we were close to nature. We judged time, weather conditions, and many things by the elements - the good earth, the blue sky, the flying of geese, and the changing winds. We looked to these for guidance and answers. Our prayers and thanksgiving were said to the four winds - to the East, from whence the new day was born; to the South, which sent the warm breeze which gave a feeling of comfort; to the West, which ended the day and brought rest; and to the North, the Mother of winter whose sharp air awakened a time of preparation for the long days ahead. We lived by God&amp;#39;s hand through nature and evaluated the changing winds to tell us or warn us of what was ahead. Today we are again evaluating the changing winds. May we be strong in spirit and equal to our Fathers of another day in reading the signs accurately and interpreting them wisely. May Wah-Kon-Tah, the Great Spirit, look down upon us, guide us, inspire us, and give us courage and wisdom. Above all, may He look down upon us and be pleased.&amp;#34; &#xD;
(Unknown Speaker addressing the National Congress of American Indians in the mid 1960&amp;#39;s, http://www.youngwarriors.net/static/pdf/resources/sacred_teachings/in_the_early_days.pdf ). &#xD;
&#xD;
For Black Elk, it constitutes and mimics the way that time and the planet operate:&#xD;
You have noticed that everything as Indian does is in a circle, and that is because the Power of the World always works in circles, and everything tries to be round..... The Sky is round, and I have heard that the earth is round like a ball, and so are all the stars. The wind, in its greatest power, whirls. Birds make their nest in circles, for theirs is the same religion as ours.... Even the seasons form a great circle in their changing, and always come back again to where they were. The life of a man is a circle from childhood to childhood, and so it is in everything where power moves. &#xD;
(Black Elk Oglala Sioux Holy Man, http://www.ilhawaii.net/~stony/quotes.html ).&#xD;
    &#xD;
Many indigenous peoples include the power of wind as part of their creation stories or different story-&#xD;
&#xD;
tellings for their nation, one example of the Hopi nation who tell stories of the relationship between Yaponcha - the wind - (a holy god) and young Hopi men who attempt to manage and control the wind. Their attempt at interfering with the wind leads to massive heat waves. In the end the Hopi fellows would release Yaponcha and reach an agreement with the wind. &#xD;
(story of Yaponcha, http://www.firstpeople.us/FP-Html-Legends/Yaponcha_The_Wind_God-Hopi.html ).&#xD;
&#xD;
The reflections into these ways of knowing about the wind structure our criticism of western relationships to energy and the cosmos. The western mind often gives neither room, validation, nor possibility to the viewpoints of Indigenous peoples especially in the context of the environment. This founds the basis of a false ontological scientific reaction. We must begin to see the possibility that the wind gives to us and is not an object we can manipulate&#xD;
Zimmerman 2006 Mary Jane, Ph. D., Discussion Leader Being Nature’s Mind: Indigenous Ways of Knowing and Planetary Consciousness February 2, 2006, http://www.earthspirituality.org/archive/zimmerman_seminar.htm&#xD;
&#xD;
In this section I will describe … which we see (86).&#xD;
&#xD;
Additionally, The massive consumption and extraction of energy resources is a product of a form of thinking that has no regard for cultural concepts of sacredness. These policies and approaches completely disregard the cultural viewpoints of indigenous peoples and how they approach the question of the environment. We would be fundamentally incompetent to just offer a new policy to offset this – the problem is one of thought.&#xD;
&#xD;
In light of this, we would like to provide the viewpoint of Tom Goldtooth, a member of the Dine Nation and of Dakota heritage, this is Goldtooth in 2010:&#xD;
Tom B.K. Goldtooth is the Executive Director of The Indigenous Environmental Network, a network of indigenous communities worldwide. He is a leader of environmental and climate justice issues and the rights of Indigenous peoples. He is co-producer of an award-winning documentary Drumbeat For Mother Earth, which addresses the effects of bio-accumulative chemicals on indigenous communities. Wicazo Sa Review, fall 2010, The State of Indigenous America Series: Earth Mother, PiÃ±ons, and Apple Pie, pp 11-28, 2010.&#xD;
&#xD;
The United States … ecosystems.&#xD;
&#xD;
In reverence to the above criticisms made by several native americans about energy policy, we would like to begin the discussion of the question of structures of thinking and liberation. The late Vine Deloria Jr. offers a problem with thinking in today’s society, this is Vine Deloria Jr. 1999:&#xD;
Vine Deloria Jr 1999 Theologian, legal scholar, JD, Ph.D, M.Div, standing rock Sioux, For This Land, p101-102&#xD;
&#xD;
If there were … of their applications for admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
Our criticism of status quo policymaking and energy policy is tied to the very same question that Deloria poses, why can we assume that a mere adjustment in where and how we get our energy can we make productive strides to alter the mentalities that have brought us to the brink of collapse. Our task is not to provide a mere new policy to usurp the current crisis in energy, that crisis has been an ongoing one for centuries. The only thing that changes about that crisis is the form that it takes. We must begin with the fundamental questions of knowledge and our orientations to the world. It is a tale of historical accident and arrogance that we have become intertwined to the belief that Western thinking holds the absolute claim to knowledge, Deloria refutes this and offers a different possibility for thinking, this is Deloria in 1999&#xD;
Vine Deloria Jr 1999 Theologian, legal scholar, JD, Ph.D, M.Div, standing rock Sioux, For This Land, 102-105&#xD;
&#xD;
Example after example … of reality.&#xD;
&#xD;
It is fundamentally insufficient to offer a genuine affirmation of the resolution that merely states that a United States federal government should increase incentives for Wind energy in the United States. One of the downfalls of western thinking is its drive towards abstraction – it is in the context of the Dine nation, the  Western Shoshone nation, the Dakota nations, the Cherokee nations and a litany of other nations inside the geographic United States that energy production happens. To affirm the words of the resolution would merely be substituting old words with new words. &#xD;
&#xD;
We affirm the resolution not as a single idea for a policy action but as a vision of the possibility of new forms of thinking and orienting ourselves towards energy production in the United States. &#xD;
&#xD;
The problem of energy policy is the problem of western interpretation. We affirm a fundamental reorientation toward the topic toward the viewpoints of the multitude of Native American nations instead of the destructive over consumptive habits of western culture. The distinction between an idea and a vision as well as the fundamental tenets of our approach to liberation are best explained by Vine Deloria Jr in 1999&#xD;
Vine Deloria Jr 1999 Theologian, legal scholar, JD, Ph.D, M.Div, standing rock Sioux, For This Land,105-107&#xD;
&#xD;
An old Indian …l become liberated. (1977)&#xD;
&#xD;
The question of the aff is of the survival of the planet – Western thinking’s monological approach to cultural thought endangers any context for an ethical relationship to the planet and places us on the path of collective suicide – expanding the limits of knowledge as affirmed by the 1ac are vital to any ethical relationship to the planet. We are all related – our patterns of thinking must reflect this.&#xD;
Friedberg 2000 Lilian, Dare to compare: Americanizing the Holocaust By: Friedberg, Lilian, American Indian Quarterly, 0095182X, June 1, 2000, Vol. 24, Issue 3&#xD;
&#xD;
Giorgio Agamben …American Holocaust.&#xD;
.&#xD;
&#xD;
The 1ac’s vision enters into the possibility for genuine reflection and dialogue on the structures of western culture. It also fundamentally alters the scientific ontological relationship to the world that destroys the concept of interconnectedness. We are not a refusal of all science but rather open science and thinking to other structures of how reality operates; the result from this openness is the possibility for new ways of engaging the world.&#xD;
Zimmerman 2006 Mary Jane, Ph. D., Discussion Leader Being Nature’s Mind: Indigenous Ways of Knowing and Planetary Consciousness February 2, 2006, http://www.earthspirituality.org/archive/zimmerman_seminar.htm&#xD;
&#xD;
Those caveats … on earth.&#xD;
&#xD;
Finally, the question of the types of knowledge we inject is not to judge the truth of native American cosmologies toward the environment, but rather to show the possibility of limitations to western metaphysical inquiry and its relationship to the natural world. Voting affirmative is an act of thinking that makes possible a new series of macronarratives to be highlighted. It changes the terms of the conversation instead of just the words we use.&#xD;

When Corbin Harney closes with “they just don’t have the time to save us” Cherokee author Andrea Smith contextualizes how you should situate your ethical response when she writes that

Unfortunately, while Habermas argues that the public sphere … indigenous sovereignty and nationhood is predicated on interrelatedness and responsibility.
These are the questions that frame the winner and loser of this debate.
We read towards specific peoples in our debating: the Western Shoshone people and the Skull Valley Goshute people. We must recognize where we are. Our age is one of radioactive nation building. Mass technologies and the colonization of national imaginary has become a staple in the complex that has allowed for nuclear testing to poison our citizens and make native American communities of Utah and Nevada the most bombed nations on earth
MASCO 2006 Joseph, The Nuclear Borderlands, 0691120773, p 25-27
The unprecedented national resources devoted to the bomb…  the United States, and with them, new psychosocial realities.
Eventually the Nuclear complex decreased its favoritism toward nuclear testing. Today, Nuclear violence is now directed toward energy research – the same structures that stabilized the nuclear weapons industry have infused nuclear power research

In September 1992, Los Alamos scientists conducted … the mobilization of a named or unnamed, but always totalizing, threat.
Our Condemnation of these practices must understand the complexity of the recipient’s choice or lack thereof. The Skull Valley Band of the Goshute is not a unanimous entity but are a nation full of dissent. Their leadership was faced with a forced choice: accept nuclear storage and the mass destruction of the surrounding environment or economically perish.

In reverence to the above criticisms made by several native americans about nuclear energy policy, we would like to begin the discussion of the question of structures of thinking and liberation. Deloria Jr. 1999

If there were any serious concern about liberation …l background ofstudents on the basis of their applications for admission.
It is fundamentally insufficient to offer a genuine affirmation of the resolution that merely states that a United States federal government should increase incentives for Wind energy in the United States. One of the downfalls of western thinking is its drive towards abstraction – it is in the context of the Western Shoshone nation and the Skull Valley Band of the Goshute Nation that energy production takes place. To affirm the words of the resolution would merely be substituting old words with new words. Thus as a means of challenging the nuclear hegemony on energy production on native lands:
We affirm the topic as a vision of wind energy production in the United States.
The problem of energy policy is the problem of western interpretation. We affirm a fundamental reorientation toward the topic toward the viewpoints of the multitude of Native American nations instead of the destructive over consumptive habits of western culture. The distinction between an idea and a vision as well as the fundamental tenets of our approach to liberation are best explained by Vine Deloria Jr in 1999

Finally, Voting affirmative is an act of thinking that makes possible a new series of macronarratives to be highlighted. It changes the terms of the conversation instead of just the words we use.

The reflections into these ways of knowing about solar structure our criticism of western relationships to energy and the cosmos. The western mind often gives neither room, validation, nor possibility to the viewpoints of Indigenous peoples especially in the context of the environment. This founds the basis of a false ontological scientific reaction. We must begin to see the possibility that Solar gives to us and is not an object we can manipulate

Additionally, The massive consumption and extraction of energy resources is a product of a form of thinking that has no regard for cultural concepts of sacredness. These policies and approaches completely disregard the cultural viewpoints of indigenous peoples and how they approach the question of the environment. We would be fundamentally incompetent to just offer a new policy to offset this – the problem is one of thought. 

In light of this, we would like to provide the viewpoint of Tom Goldtooth, a member of the Dine Nation and of Dakota heritage, this is Goldtooth in 2010:
Tom B.K. Goldtooth is the Executive Director of The Indigenous Environmental Network, a network of indigenous communities worldwide. He is a leader of environmental and climate justice issues and the rights of Indigenous peoples. He is co-producer of an award-winning documentary Drumbeat For Mother Earth, which addresses the effects of bio-accumulative chemicals on indigenous communities.

In reverence to the above criticisms made by several native americans about energy policy, we would like to begin the discussion of the question of structures of thinking and liberation. The late Vine Deloria Jr. offers a problem with thinking in today~’s society, this is Vine Deloria Jr. 1999:

The problem of energy policy is the problem of western interpretation. We affirm a fundamental reorientation toward the topic toward the viewpoints of the multitude of Native American nations instead of the destructive over consumptive habits of western culture. 

The distinction between an idea and a vision as well as the fundamental tenets of our approach to liberation are best explained by Vine Deloria Jr in 1999

An old Indian saying captures …will become liberated. (1977)


The question of the aff is of the survival of the planet – Western thinking~’s monological approach to cultural thought endangers any context for an ethical relationship to the planet and places us on the path of collective suicide – expanding the limits of knowledge as affirmed by the 1ac are vital to any ethical relationship to the planet. We are all related – our patterns of thinking must reflect this.

The 1ac~’s vision enters into the possibility for genuine reflection and dialogue on the structures of western culture. It also fundamentally alters the scientific ontological relationship to the world that destroys the concept of interconnectedness. We are not a refusal of all science but rather open science and thinking to other structures of how reality operates; the result from this openness is the possibility for new ways of engaging the world.

Those caveats having … the next stages of life on earth.

Finally, the question of the types of knowledge we inject is not to judge the truth of native American cosmologies toward the environment, but rather to show the possibility of limitations to western metaphysical inquiry and its relationship to the natural world. Voting affirmative is an act of thinking that makes possible a new series of macronarratives to be highlighted. It changes the terms of the conversation instead of just the words we use.

Surkis, 1996 (Judith, Doctoral candidate in the History Dept. at Cornell University, “No Fun and Games Until Someone Loses and Eye: Transgression and Masculinity in Bataille and Foucault”, Diacritics, Vol. 26, No. 2, Project MUSE)

Foucault upholds Bataille as an always already &amp;#34;sovereign&amp;#34; figure who marks the limits of (Foucault&amp;#39;s) philosophical language. He urges that &amp;#34;the sovereignty of these experiences must surely be recognized some day, and we must try to assimilate them: not to reveal their truth-a ridiculous pretension with respect to words that form our limits-but to serve as a basis for finally liberating our language&amp;#34; 38-39. In representing and forming the limits of Foucault&amp;#39;s discourse, Bataille offers a glimpse of a future &amp;#34;liberation&amp;#34; to Foucault. He insistently positions Bataille beyond himself, figuring him as a horizon to reach toward. In effect, Foucault ignores how, as we have seen in the conclusion to Erotism, Bataille remains on the near rather than the far side of the limit. In &amp;#34;Preface,&amp;#34; Bataille takes on the character of the convulsed or lost woman&amp;#39;s body which appears so frequently in his own writings: &amp;#34;Bataille&amp;#39;s language.., continually breaks down at the center of its space, exposing in his nakedness, a visible and insistent subject who had tried to keep language at arms length, but who now finds himself thrown by it, exhausted upon the sands of that which he can no longer say&amp;#34; 39. Foucault&amp;#39;s description of the exposed, &amp;#34;naked,&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;visible&amp;#34; subject is significant in light of Bataille&amp;#39;s own discussions of the role of naked figures in the dynamic of erotic transgression. Bataille&amp;#39;s language provides the necessary, visible figure in and through whom Foucault can &amp;#34;witness&amp;#34; the possibility of his own transgression. Bataille&amp;#39;s convulsed (figurative) body marks the limit and makes the possibility of its transgression visible to Foucault. David Carroll, in his discussion of &amp;#34;Preface,&amp;#34; comments that &amp;#34;there is no doubt in Foucault&amp;#39;s mind that the philosophers of transgression have achieved this sovereign thought, that the liberation of thought and discourse has already occurred&amp;#34; 188. Carroll argues that, &amp;#34;through this mimetic identification with Bataille and others, Foucault guarantees in advance his own critical power and gathers the spoils of victory from a battle fought by others&amp;#34; 188. Thus, in Carroll&amp;#39;s interpretation, as in my own, Foucault must figure Bataille&amp;#39;s transgression as an event that has already occurred. I would argue that beyond simply supporting Foucault&amp;#39;s discourse, Bataille, as a figure who marks both the limit and its rupture, actually allows Foucault to envision his own (future) transgression. However, although Bataille furnishes the necessary &amp;#34;image&amp;#34; of transgression, he does not complete the project Foucault has in mind; Bataille&amp;#39;s transgression-like that of the erotic object-remains incomplete. The form of &amp;#34;the philosophy of eroticism&amp;#34; lies in the future- Bataille&amp;#39;s own project notwithstanding. Foucault asserts that &amp;#34;no form of reflection yet developed, no established discourse, can supply its model, its foundation, or even the riches of its vocabulary&amp;#34; 40. He reiterates Bataille&amp;#39;s own hope that the theorization of the subjective experience of eroticism, exemplified by &amp;#34;the language of sexuality,&amp;#34; will mark a path toward the transgression of conventional philosophical discourse. Bataille is here positioned as already beyond language and, as a result, in need of Foucault&amp;#39;s theoretical elucidation: Our efforts are undoubtedly better spent in trying to speak of this experience and in making it speak from the depths where its language fails, from precisely the place where words escape it, where the subject who speaks has just vanished, where the spectacle topples over before an upturned eye-from where Bataille&amp;#39;s death has recently placed his language. 40

This PIK is a voting issue - the PIC steals the entire affirmative and endorses the entire advocacy of the aff.  This destroys any possible 2ac offense - they have no specific solvency argument of advocate. This means the alternative is not textually competitive – we can literally do both – the text of the aff is an altering of our epistemological positioning toward energy production. Our interpretation means they can run this as a disad to the method but not as a PIC.


Their rational utilitarian subject argument doesn’t make sense in the context of the aff interjection. Human nature is not inherently violent – there is a complexity involved in spirituality 
Winther psychoanalyst 2006 Mats The Psychodynamics of Terrorism http://home7.swipnet.se/~w-73784/terror.htm

So by coming to accept &amp;#39;the other&amp;#39; in ourselves we could better approximate the complete image of human. Our instinctual nature includes &amp;#39;spirituality&amp;#39;, such as artistic expression, and not only sexuality and aggression. St Paul, who really was the first psychoanalyst, came to realize that the real law abides in our heart, and he himself abandoned completely his own Oedipal nature, including the superego. He passed beyond the stage of legalism and experienced rebirth. Yet, he did express that it&amp;#39;s not &amp;#39;me&amp;#39; who is now living, it&amp;#39;s that &amp;#39;other me&amp;#39;, which is Christ, representing the totality of human nature. So, in case of Paul, it&amp;#39;s not the question of two concurrent &amp;#39;subjects&amp;#39; in his psychic configuration. Somehow, when the first dies the second rises. Similarly, Christopherus experienced death and rebirth as he was drowned (baptised) in the river. Freud (1938) argued that, in a sense, original Christianity is superior to both Judaism and Islam as it projects an overcoming of the superego and the Oedipus (vid. &amp;#39;Moses&amp;#39; (1938)). Few people are capable of attaining, like Paul, a complete freeing of personality. Resolution of the Oedipus is not accomplished once and for all in a person&amp;#39;s life. It comes in stages. But the realization of a &amp;#39;spiritual guide&amp;#39; within, similar to &amp;#39;The Green Man&amp;#39;, is sometimes enough to compensate for the destructive impact of the &amp;#39;Big Dead Spirit.&amp;#39; This redeeming effect is what occurred to the young suicide bomber in Tom Roberts&amp;#39;s film Inside the Mind of the Suicide Bomber (2003). He linked up to his instinctual inner nature, and managed to overpower his superego, much like Paul, who ceased persecuting Christans. This is actually the reverse of childhood, as the tables are turned between superego and instinctual nature. 
The alternative is a method of abstraction creating competition through reduction and separation means it can never solve the aff –it risks recreating the very same structures of thinking

Consequently, Eurocentric culture produces a general sense of insecurity, &amp;#34;an incessant need to control, dominate, or be better than others.&amp;#34; n39 The materialistic paradigm of Eurocentric societies produces certain cultural determinates, which shape and direct all social productions within the culture. n40 These cultural determinates manifest themselves mainly in the areas of thought structuring and processing and include epistemological values and logic. n41 The *334 following European cultural attributes are the most significant for the purposes of this Article. 1. Dichotomous Reasoning. Eurocentric culture embraces a reasoning style that is dichotomous. n42 That is, the world is known and described through the comparison of incompatible opposites. n43Virtually all of reality is split into paired opposites. n44 According to Marimba Ani, &amp;#34;this begins with the separation of self from &amp;#34;other,&amp;#39; and is followed by the separation of the self into various dichotomies (reason/emotion, mind/body, intellect/nature).&amp;#34; n45 Dichotomous reasoning leads to &amp;#34;either/or&amp;#34; conclusions and makes it difficult to process information wholistically. n46 The dichotomous reasoning found in Eurocentric cultures may be contrasted to the diunital form of reason prevalent in African and other non-European cultures. n47 Diunital reasoning leads to &amp;#34;both/and&amp;#34; conclusions and permits the consideration of information that is not *335 neatly categorized or compartmentalized. n48 2. Employment of Hierarchies. Having submitted the material world to a process of fragmentation, the Eurocentric mind organizes the resulting dichotomies into hierarchies of greater and lesser value.n49 Within dichotomies, one pole is valued as superior to its opposite. n50 Thus reason is considered to be superior to its opposite, emotion, &amp;#34;that is, when &amp;#34;reason&amp;#39; rules &amp;#34;passion.&amp;#39;&amp;#34; n51 All reality is described in hierarchical terms; n52 consequently, the Eurocentric mind perceives everything as better or worse than something else. n53 In this way, grounds are established for relationships based on power, &amp;#34;for the dominance of the &amp;#34;superior&amp;#39; form or phenomenon over that which is perceived to be inferior ....&amp;#34; n54 3. Analytical Thought. Analytic reasoning is the familiar cognitive style within Eurocentric cultural spheres. n55 In analytic reasoning, an item or issue under consideration must first be broken down into its constituent parts before each part is then separately examined. n56 While important information may be gleaned through analytic reasoning, &amp;#34;there are some things that cannot be divided without destroying their integrity.&amp;#34; n57 In Eurocentric societies, analytic reasoning is utilized to the exclusion of, and not in addition to, synthetic reasoning processes. n58 Thus, interrelation- *336 ships are more difficult to perceive, and the fragmentation and seeming disconnection of reality is encouraged. n59 4. Objectification. In Eurocentric culture, the world beyond the self is viewed as a collection of objects to be controlled. n60 Indeed, in Eurocentric cultures &amp;#34;the most valued relationship is between person and object.&amp;#34; n61 As previously noted, self-worth is often viewed in terms of the objects one has under control. n62 The Eurocentric mind, given a choice, prefers to interpret the world in subject-object terms rather than subject-subject terms. n63 5. Abstraction. Closely related to the process of objectification, is a tendency in Eurocentric thought toward abstraction. n64 Distilled excretions of ideas take precedent over ideas in context. While abstraction can be a valuable tool in any society, n65 in Eurocentric societies, it is reified to the extent that it becomes separate from and more important than the concrete experiences from which it originates. n66 Since the abstract is separated from the concrete, its validity cannot be questioned. Thus, abstraction becomes a tool of control. &amp;#34;Its role is to establish epistemological authority and, of course, other kinds of authority can then be derived from and supported by it.&amp;#34; n67 The preference for written forms of communication over oral forms also derives from Eurocentric culture&amp;#39;s reification of the abstract. n68 6. Extreme Rationalism. It is a foundational Eurocentric be- *337 lief that the universe can be explained wholly in rational terms. n69 This means that to the Eurocentric mind everything is connected in an ordered and structured way, organized around the principles of cause and effect. n70 The extreme rationalism that is found in Eurocentric societies has been described as an &amp;#34;attempt to explain all of reality as though it has been created by the European mind for the purposes of control.&amp;#34; n71
The notion of fluidity and relativism as a negation of grand narratives serves whitestream America. The assumption of a world of simulation without objective reality enables massive capitalist commodification. Their alternative is not just inaccessible but is destructive to native cultures
Grande 2004 Sandy,  Associate Professor of Education, specializes in Native American education, critical race theory Red pedagogy, p 112

In view of the above, it is clear to see how postmodernism—the notion of fluid boundaries, the relativizing of difference and negation of grand narratives —primarily serves whitestream America. The multiphrenia of postmodern plurality, its &amp;#34;world of simulation&amp;#34; and obliteration of any sense of objective reality, has given rise to a frenetic search for the &amp;#34;authentic&amp;#34; led by culture vultures and capitalist bandits fraught with &amp;#34;imperialist nostalgia &amp;#34;H In response, American Indian communities have restricted access to the discursive spaces of American Indian culture and identity and the nondiscursive borders of American Indian communities. In short, the notion of fluidity has never worked to the advantage of indigenous peoples. Federal agencies haveinvoked the language of fluid or unstable identities as the rationale for dismantling the structures of tribal life. Whitestream America has seized upon the message of relativism to declare open season on Indians, and whitestream academics have employed the language of signification and simulation to transmute centuries of war between indigenous peoples and their respective nation-states into a &amp;#34;genetic and cultural dialogue&amp;#34; (Valle and Torres I 141). Thus, in spite of its &amp;#34;democratic&amp;#34; promise, postmodernism and its ludic theories of identity fail to provide indigenous communities the theoretica1 grounding for asserting their claims as colonized peoples, and, more important, impede construction of transcendent emancipatory theories. Despite the pressures of cultural encroachment and cultural imperialism however, indigenous communities continue to evolve as sites of political contestation and cultural empowerment. They manage to survive the dangers of colonialist forces by employing proactive strategies, which emphasize education, empowerment, and self-determination, and defensive tactics that protect against unfettered economic and political encroachment. Thus, whatever else the borders of indigenous communities may or may not demarcate, they continue to serve as potent geographic filters of all that is non-Indian—dividing between the real and metaphoric spaces that differentiate Indian country from the rest of whitestream America. pedagogical Implications of Postmodern Theories As students learn to navigate the plurality of difference, it is equally important that in avoid falling into the (postmodern) trap of relativism. A postmodern theory of difference that insists on impartiality masks the power and privilege that underpins whitestream culture and perspectives. In other words, American Indian students do not enter into a social space in which identities compete with equal power for legitimacy; rather, they are infused into a political terrain that presumes their inferiority. For example, postmodern musings of subjectivity as disembodied and free-floating ignore the fact that American indian students, along with other indigenous peoples, are &amp;#34;engaged with the states in a complex relationship in which there are varying degrees of interdependency at play&amp;#34; (Alfred 1999, 85). As such, American Indian students are no longer free to &amp;#34;reinvent&amp;#34; themselves nor able to liberally &amp;#34;transgress&amp;#34; borders of difference, but, rather, remain captive to the determined spaces of colonialist rule. These students experience the binds of the paradox inherent to current modes of identity theory and it becomes increasingly evident that neither the cold linearity of blood-quantum nor the tortured weakness of self identification&amp;#34; (both systems designed and legitimated by the state) will provide them any relief (Alfred 1999, 84). Thus, while postmodern theorists rightly question the whole notion of origins and work to disrupt the grand narrative of modernism, its hyperelastic and all-inclusive categories offer little to no protection against the colonialist forces of cultural encroachment and capitalist commodification.

Attempts at changing the world are not only prerequisites to life celebration but also lead to new forms of life celebration that their evidence doesn’t assume

And what happens from there? From the meetings, from the rallies, from the petitions and the teach-ins? What happens next? There is, after all, always a next. If you win this time – end aid to the contras, divest from apartheid South Africa, force debt-forgiveness by technologically advanced countries – there is always more to do. There is the de-unionization of workers, there are gay rights, there is Burma, there are the Palestinians, the Tibetans. There will always be Tibetans, even if they aren’t in Tibet, even if they aren’t Asian. But is that the only question: Next? Or is that just the question we focus on? What’s the next move in this campaign, what’s the next campaign? Isn’t there more going on than that? After all, engaging in political organizing is a practice, or a group of practices. It contributes to making you who you are. It’s where the power is, and where your life is, and where the intersection of your life and those of others (many of whom you will never meet, even if it’s for their sake that you’re involved) and the buildings and streets of your town is. This moment when you are seeking to change the world, whether by making a suggestion in a meeting or singing at a rally or marching in silence or asking for a signature on a petition, is not a moment in which you don’t exist. It’s not a moment of yours that you sacrifice for others so that it no longer belongs to you. It remains a moment of your life, sedimenting in you to make you what you will become, emerging out of a past that is yours as well. What will you make of it, this moment? How will you be with others, those others around you who also do not cease to exist when they begin to organize or to protest or to resist? The illusion is to think that this has nothing to do with you. You’ve made a decision to participate in world-changing. Will that be all there is to it? Will it seem to you a simple sacrifice, for this small period of time, of who you are for the sake of others? Are you, for this moment, a political ascetic? Asceticism like that is dangerous. Freedom lies not in our distance from the world but in the historically fragile and contingent ways we are folded into it, just as we ourselves are folds of it. If we take Merleau-Ponty’s Being not as a rigid foundation or a truth behind appearances but as the historical folding and refolding of a univocity, then our freedom lies in the possibility of other foldings. Merleau-Ponty is not insensitive to this point. His elusive concept of the invisible seems to gesture in this direction. Of painting, he writes: the proper essence of the visible is to have a layer of invisibility in the strict sense, which it makes present as a certain absence . . . There is that which reaches the eye directly, the frontal properties of the visible; but there is also that which reaches it from below . . . and that which reaches it from above . . . where it no longer participates in the heaviness of origins but in free accomplishments.9 Elsewhere, in The Visible and the Invisible, he says: if . . . the surface of the visible, is doubled up over its whole extension with an invisible reserve; and if, finally, in our flesh as the flesh of things, the actual, empirical, ontic visible, by a sort of folding back, invagination, or padding, exhibits a visibility, a possibility that is not the shadow of the actual but its principle . . . an interior horizon and an exterior horizon between which the actual visible is a partitioning and which, nonetheless, open indefinitely only upon other visibles . . .10 What are we to make of these references? We can, to be sure, see the hand of Heidegger in them. But we may also, and for present purposes more relevantly, see an intersection with Foucault’s work on freedom. There is an ontology of freedom at work here, one that situates freedom not in the private reserve of an individual but in the unfinished character of any historical situation. There is more to our historical juncture, as there is to a painting, than appears to us on the surface of its visibility. The trick is to recognize this, and to take advantage of it, not only with our thoughts but with our lives. And that is why, in the end, there can be no such thing as a sad revolutionary. To seek to change the world is to offer a new form of life-celebration. It is to articulate a fresh way of being, which is at once a way of seeing, thinking, acting, and being acted upon. It is to fold Being once again upon itself, this time at a new point, to see what that might yield. There is, as Foucault often reminds us, no guarantee that this fold will not itself turn out to contain the intolerable. In a complex world with which we are inescapably entwined, a world we cannot view from above or outside, there is no certainty about the results of our experiments. Our politics are constructed from the same vulnerability that is the stuff of our art and our daily practices. But to refuse to experiment is to resign oneself to the intolerable; it is to abandon both the struggle to change the world and the opportunity to celebrate living within it. And to seek one aspect without the other – life-celebration without world-changing, world-changing without life-celebration – is to refuse to acknowledge the chiasm of body and world that is the wellspring of both. If we are to celebrate our lives, if we are to change our world, then perhaps the best place to begin to think is our bodies, which are the openings to celebration and to change, and perhaps the point at which the war within us that I spoke of earlier can be both waged and resolved. That is the fragile beauty that, in their different ways, both Merleau- Ponty and Foucault have placed before us. The question before us is whether, in our lives and in our politics, we can be worthy of it. 

Bataille’s notion of expenditure is the face of contemporary industrial societies – this takes out their distinctions of utility, and also proves the aff would just further the models they criticize.
Goux et al 90

A lesson, however, emerges from this. It is not the quantity of waste, the amount of squandering or the importance of unproductive consumption (which is impossible to assign in economic terms, but which supposes a moral criterion) that enables us to distinguish be- tween precapitalist societies, supposedly governed by the principle of pure expenditure, and capitalist societies, supposedly governed by &amp;#34;the utilitarian.&amp;#34; Undoubtedly, no society has squandered so much, produced and spent so much merely for the sake of producing and spending, as contemporary industrial societies. The difference lies in the mode of waste, its social mise-en-scene, its representation, and finally the imaginary of the expenditure. Without arriving at clear conclusions, Bataille looked for the singularity of modern societies in the individualism of their expenditure (OC, &amp;#34;The Limits of Utility,&amp;#34; 232 if.) and its allotment (La Part maudite, &amp;#34;La Notion de depense,&amp;#34; 37) (which is opposed to communal and spectacular waste, offered by the rich for their own glorification). Perhaps Bataille&amp;#39;s economic theory is explained not by his discov- ery of potlach in primitive societies, but by the presentiment of what capitalism is becoming. That is why Bataille finds himself in such bad company: in troubling consonance (although one cannot reduce Bataille to what compromises him here) with Gilder&amp;#39;s postmodern legitimation. What Gilder reveals is the play of capitalism, which without his knowing it overdetermines Bataille&amp;#39;s exaltation and which also, at the moment that it becomes even more visible, daz- zling, spectacular, sets off Baudrillard&amp;#39;s accelerated derangement. Baudrillard and Gilder map out the same configuration of post- modern capitalism. But Gilder is the truth of Baudrillard since he wants politically and theologically the social play of which Baudril- lard is content to be the appalled television viewer (more than the rational critic). At the moment that Gilder forges the ideological instrument of a libertarian (or rather neoconservative) politics and thus determines a reality, even indirectly, Baudrillard endures the spectacle of that politics in turmoil and unreality. Gilder theorizes postmodern capitalism from the point of view of the active en- trepreneur, while Baudrillard raves brilliantly about postmodern cap- italism in the televisual armchair of the stupefied consumer. But Gilder&amp;#39;s entrepreneurial morality proves that there is indeed in our era an economic political project, a locatable metamorphosis of cap- ital, where Baudrillard sees only a desintegrative and paradoxical poetry.1 But if Bataille was unable to think through consumerist capitalism (which took on a more readable form only after the upheavals of the 1960s), if he was unable to think the dissolution of all foundation in the unconvertibility of the general equivalent (which could serve as a definition of the postmodern conjuncture)16, if he could not think the subsequent legitimations of a &amp;#34;postbourgeois&amp;#34; capitalism which dis- misses the Enlightenment and the great rationalist narrative, Bataille did offer a new grid which also facilitates this thought. Moreover, with his fragmented and fissured work, he testified to an uncondi- tional demand that has the volcanic center of the most powerful contradictions, a demand before which his existentialist contempo- raries appear-with the passage of time-as mere &amp;#34;men of letters.&amp;#34; We know that his work in &amp;#34;general economics&amp;#34; had a major place among Bataille&amp;#39;s preoccupations, and that it was undoubtedly the connecting strand of his theoretical efforts. Even the mystical essays of La Somme atheologique are indebted to this persistant endeavor, even if only as a moment of distancing, of overwhelming liberation, from the burden of his argumentation. The preceding pages attempt only to mark several guideposts: both the difficulties of the &amp;#34;notion of expenditure&amp;#34; when one tries to link it with contemporary conditions, and the still unexhausted richness of an opening in which we seek the bases of a morality for which the two modes of communication could be articulated. One of these is daily, prosaic exchange, and the other is the stronger mode of love, the festival, and art-communicational unreason



We must understand how coloniality informs the basis of academic knowledge production

Though revolutionary feminisms have relevance for indigenous women, it¶ remains critical for indigenous scholars to question how the experiences of indigenous¶ peoples are reshaped and transformed when articulated through the¶ epistemic frames of Western theory, whether it is postmodern, feminist, or¶ Marxist theory. As Trask notes, all haole—whether revolutionary or conservative—¶ benefit from the control of American Indian land and resources, and the¶ self-determination of indigenous peoples has never been the goal of marxism,¶ feminism, or any other First World ideology (Trask 1996, 912). For instance,¶ in contradistinction to Marxist theory, indigenous scholars do not view participation¶ in the colonialist project to be determined by class. As Trask notes:¶&amp;#34;Even poor haole take for granted their freedom of travel, power of purchase,¶ and the familiar intercourse of their language and institutions and customs in¶ | indigenous homelands. American citizenship is the passport to Indian¶ country; the American dollar is the economic and political currency; English¶ is the official as well as everyday language&amp;#34; (Trask 1996, 912).¶ Thus, before current articulations of Marxist or any First-World theory can¶ be considered as useful toolsin the process of articulating a critical theory of¶ indigenhta, important questions need to be examined. At the same time, in¶ this moment of late capitalism and advanced colonialism, it is critically important¶ for indigenous scholars to examine, articulate, and disrupt the global¶ capitalistic forces that work to imperil tribal existence, making the work of¶ revolutionary feminist scholars increasingly relevant. Ultimately, however, indigenous scholars —both men and women —will¶ need to construct their own theoretical systems relevant to their current struggles¶ and conditions. The precipitating theory of idigenista needs to remain¶ rooted in the struggles of indigenous peoples and the quest for sovereignty¶ and self-determination, as well as be elastic enough to incorporate the diversity¶ of American Indian women&amp;#39;s lives. As we work in recognition of this diversity,¶ however, we must also struggle to find the common ground, to assert¶ the primacy of the struggle for self-determination and to work in solidarity¶ against the burgeoning effects of the colonialist project. With this goal in¶ mind, I close with words of indigenous scholar, activist, and warrior-woman¶ M. Annette Jaimes Guerrero:¶The only way to reverse the dominant colonialist mentality and prodevelopment¶ agenda is for traditionally oriented Native peoples to reclaim their¶ birthright, internally and outwardly. In such a liberation movement, Native¶ women can be seen as proactive agents of change leading the way as &amp;#34;exemplars¶ of Indigenism.&amp;#34; This indigenous movement is about our decolonization;¶ it is focused on the recovery of our health and respective cultures, the healing¶ of our mind, body, and spirit, among our kinship relations of both genders of¶ all ages. Such a movement exists in reciprocity with our natural environment¶ and is part of the reclaiming of our respective homelands for our liberation¶ through decolonization. This is the significance of ecocultural connection to¶ the Earth, as the archetypal Feminine Principle, and as a living organic presence¶ that we Native daughters, love, honor, and respect, the Mother of Us All.¶ (James Guerrero 1997,218)

 Batailles’ theory of expenditure doesn’t apply to postmodern consumer capitalism, which is based on massive amounts of consumption and waste – exactly what Batailles advocates.

Yang 2000 (Mayfair Mei-hui, Professor of Anthropology at the University of California Santa Barbara, has heldfellowships at the Center for Chinese Studies of the University of Michigan, the Chicago Humanities Institute, Universityof Chicago, and the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, “Putting Global Capitalism in Its Place: Economic Hybridity,Bataille, and Ritual Expenditure,” Current Anthropology, University of Chicago Journals)


Scholars such as JeanJoseph Goux (1998) have pointed to a troubling overlap between Bataille’s views on luxury andsacrificial expenditure and postmodern consumer capitalism. Consumer capitalism is also predicated on massiveconsumption and waste rather than on the thrift, asceticism, and accumulation against which Bataille directed his theory of expenditure. It exhibits potlatch features in the tendency for businesses to give goods away in the hope that “supply creates its own demand”; it collapses the distinction between luxury and useful goods and between need and desire (Goux1998).Unlike modernist capitalism, postmodern consumer capitalism is driven by consumption rather than production. Thus,Bataille’s vision of the ritual destruction of wealth as defying the principles of accumulative and productive capitalism does not address this different phase of consumer capitalism, whose contours have only become clear since his death in 1962. Itseems to me that despite their overt similarities, the principles of ritual consumption and those of consumer capitalism are basically incompatible. If Bataille had addressed our consumer society today, he would have said that this sort of consumption is still in the service of production and productive accumulation, since every act of consumption in the worldof leisure, entertainment, media, fashion, and home décor merely feeds back into the growth of the economy rather thanleading to the finality and loss of truly nonproductive expenditure. Even much of modern warfare is no longer trulydestructive but tied into the furthering of militaryindustrial production¶ ‐¶ . Nor, despite its economic excesses, does our consumer culture today challenge the basic economic logic of rational private accumulation as a selfdepleting archaic¶ ‐¶ sacrificial economy does.¶ 15¶ Furthermore, capitalist consumption is very much an¶ individual ¶ consumption rather than oneinvolving the whole community or social order.





Hold a very low threshold to all of their link arguments. There is a complexity inherent to speed and technology. 
Bleiker 2002 Roland Politics After Seattle: Dilemmas of the Anti-Globalisation Movement 20 juin 2002, http://conflits.revues.org/index1057.html
Globalisation has not annihilated dissent. Quite to the contrary. There are at least two domains in which speed has magnified the possibilities for interfering with the conduct of global politics. 21First, speed provides activists with a range of new tools to organise and co-ordinate their actions. Many of the protesters that went to Seattle, Melbourne and Prague, for instance, were brought together by e-mail correspondences and a variety of web-sites that organised resistance against neo-liberal forms of globalisation. The increased ability to exchange information across large differences has had a tremendous influence on the mobilisation of dissent within civil society. Social movements and NGOs that had hitherto existed in isolation can now easily communicate with each other. They can share data and insights about similar concerns and organise common actions in ways that was not possible before.27 A study on citizen activism against the Multilateral Agreement on Investment (MAI), for instance, suggests that the Internet played a vital role in the relative success of the movement - the MAI was at least temporarily pushed off the OECD agenda. The Internet was central to the camping insofar as it facilitated communication among activists, permitted publication of a related information and helped to put pressure on politicians and policy-makers in member states.28 Cyber-based protest organisation has become more extensive and sophisticated as activists have learned from previous experiences. The protests in Quebec City, for instance, have given raise to numerous web-sites that exchange information and coordinate future actions.29 Not surprisingly, this move into cyberspace takes place at both sides of the struggle. The World Bank, for instance, has started plans for a major online conference in order to avoid another round of public protests.30 22Second, and perhaps even more importantly, speed has fundamentally changed the spatial dynamics of dissident practices. Protest actions, such as street demonstrations or acts of civil disobedience, used to take place in a mostly local context. They engaged the spatial dynamics that were operative in the interactive relationship between ruler and ruler. The contraction of space, however, has altered the very foundations of these socio-political dynamics. An act of protest, as it took place in Seattle, now interacts in a much wider and more complex array of political spaces. Images of a protest march may flicker over television screens world-wide only hours after people have taken to the street. As a result, a local act of resistance can acquire almost immediately a much larger, cross-territorial dimension. 23Any protest action that draws sufficient media attention has the potential to engender a political process that transcends its immediate spatial environment. It competes for the attention of global television audiences and thus interferes with the struggle over values that ultimately shapes the world we live in. &amp;#34;A world united by Benetton slogans, Nike sweatshops and McDonald&amp;#39;s jobs might not be anyone&amp;#39;s utopian global village,&amp;#34; says Naomi Klein, &amp;#34;but its fibre-optic cables and shared cultural references are nonetheless laying the foundations for the first truly international people&amp;#39;s movement.31 But the recent wave of global protests is hardly the first international movement of its kind. Nor is it as unproblematic as Klein suggests. For some the revolution of speed is too random to allow for critical interference and, indeed, for human agency. Jean Baudrillard, for instance, believes that the distinctions between reality and virtuality, political practice and simulation are blurred to the extent that they are no longer recognisable.32 Our media culture, he says, has annihilated reality in stages, such that in the end its simulating image « bears no relation to any reality whatever : it is its own pure simulacrum. » Television, the unproblematic transmission of the hyperreal, has conditioned our mind such that we have lost the ability to penetrate beneath the manifest levels of surface.33 24Patterns of global protest do not confirm the pessimistic views that Baudrillard and others espouse. The blurring of reality and virtuality has not annihilated dissent. The fact that televised images are hyperreal does not necessarily diminish their influence. Independently of how instantaneous, distorted and simulated images of a protest action may be, they still influence our perceptions of issues, and thus also our political responses to them. To accept the logic of speed, then, is not to render political influence obsolete, but to acknowledge multiple and overlapping spatial and temporal spheres within which political practices are constantly being shaped and reshaped. 25Judged from such a vantage-point, the actions in Seattle and other cities are not quite as ineffective as they appear at first sight. Even without engendering immediate institutional transformations, traces of these protest events continue to influence the struggle over global values - and thus over the direction of politics. The repeated presence of protest actions around the world guarantees that a number of key issues, from environmental protection to minimal labour standards, remain discussed in the public sphere. Indeed, even before Seattle, O&amp;#39;Brien and his collaborators had already concluded that the interaction between social movements and multilateral economic institutions has transformed the nature of global economic governance. The authors label this transformation &amp;#34;complex multilateralism&amp;#34; in order to recognise that actors other than states now can and do express the public interest and shape issues of governance.34 The ensuing dynamics testify for the emergence of a new kind of global politics - one in which key political struggles occur beyond the control of the national state. Consider, for instance, how global networks of communication have enabled indigenous peoples in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand to engage in forms of activism that ensured them an audience beyond their immediate surroundings. For William Connolly, this tendency confirms that speed has multiple dimensions : not only the encroaching and disabling one that Baudrillard (and to some extent Virilio) argue, but also one that &amp;#34;supports the possibility of democratic pluralization.&amp;#34;35 Some even think ahead towards a time in which we can speak of unconditional universal hospitality - a situation in which rights and responsibilities would no longer be circumscribed by the spatial and political logic of national sovereignty.36 26But the increased ability to influence the course of events also carries certain responsibilities. And it engenders a new set of challenges : How is one to move from a mere protest movement to the task of constructing a more just and viable world order ? Who decides about the desirable course of action, the direction of protest, the means that are appropriate and the ends that are desirable ? How is one to maintain a level of solidarity or common interest in a vast array of diverging and competing interests ? Who Speaks for Whom ? The Problem of Representation  27At first sight, the demands of the protesters seem clear and unequivocal. A participant in the Prague demonstrations puts it this way : &amp;#34;To advance the citizen&amp;#39;s control over globalisation.&amp;#34;37 But this is where the consensus ends and where difficulties begin. As mentioned at various points in this essay, the people that participated in the protest actions in Prague and other cities represented a great variety of different and at times conflicting interests and constituencies, from steelworkers to feminist and environmentalists. They ranged from radical anarchists to moderate reformers. &amp;#34;There was a cacophony of voices and issues,&amp;#34; say Margaret Levi and David Olson about Seattle.38 And once these voices were picked up by global television networks, they became intertwined with an infinitely more diverse and random array of voices and images, all flickering and babbling away without much form or direction. 28Media representations follow their own logic - different from the logic of the events they seek to capture - blending information and entertainment in often highly problematic ways. Indeed, information is often a secondary issue : &amp;#34;The entire script content of the CBS nightly half-hour news,&amp;#34; Michael Ignatieff reminds us, &amp;#34;would fit on three-quarters of the front page of the New York Times.39 This is one of the reasons why Virilio believes that &amp;#34;the paradoxical logic of the video-frame privileges the accident, the surprise, over the durable substance of the message.&amp;#34;40 It also privileges a specific key target audience : the television viewers of the Western World, those with the spending power to sustain the networks&amp;#39; advertisement rates and corporate profits. It is hardly surprising, then, that not all forms of protest receive the same level of media attention. There is a significant different between coverage of activism in developed and developing countries. 29For decades, sustained popular protests against the key multilateral economic institutions have taken place in many parts of the Third World. Countless IMF-sponsored structural adjustment program have triggered sustained protest reactions by the local populace. These protests have increased in recent years. One can find many examples for the year 2000 alone : twenty million Indian workers went on strike to oppose IMF and World Bank policies ; some five thousand students, environmentalists and displaced people overwhelmed police lines protecting an Asian Development Bank meeting in Chiang Mai ; small anti-IMF protests in Argentina were dispersed by the police, but precipitated a mass protest of 80,000 people ; tens of thousands of Korean workers and students repeatedly took to the streets to protest against IMF-mandated austerity measures. The list could go on, and would also include protests in Bolivia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Mexico, Brazil, Columbia, Costa Rica, Honduras, Haiti, South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, Malawi and Zambia, to name just a few counties, and only for protest during the year 2000.41 30Wide-spread and massive as these protests were, they received relatively little coverage in the global print and television media. Most of these uprisings warranted barely a line, or none at all, in the New York Times, Le Mondeor the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. They rarely make the BBC or the CNN World News. The Battle for Seattle, by contrast, was located at the heart of the industrialised world, and thus immediately turned into a global media spectacle. 31A single molotov cocktail in Seattle, Washington or Quebec is worth far more media capital than an entire protest march in Cochabamba, Lagos or Port-au-Prince. Twenty million Indian workers on strike or 80,000 Argentineans descending into the streets generate far less global attention than two dozen protesters in Davos, Melbourne or Gothenburg. Southern social movements clearly operate not only in a different local environment, but also according to very different rules of power.42 But what does this say about the dynamic of protest ? About the struggle for voice and representation ? 32One of the main criticism against the protests in Prague and Seattle was that the protesters were predominantly from the West and thus represented a very particular, often white and middle-class perspective. Here too, one could go on debating the provenance and motivations of the protestors. They certainly were not all rich and not all Westerners. But in most protest actions the Third World was clearly underrepresented. Significant political implications result. Some go as far as arguing that the new wave of global activism runs the risk of reproducing the very same neo-liberal practices of exclusion it so strongly opposes.43 It is questionable, for instance, to what extent the calls for higher labour and environmental standards, which was a central demand of most protest actions, is actually shared in the Third World. Many developing countries face the challenge to promote basic economic growth and may not be able afford the same environmental standards that are now established in the developed world. Indeed, some representatives of the Third World in Seattle argued that the US government was able to use the protest as a convenient pretext to break off discussions on trade issues, for a successful WTO negotiation round could have brought certain benefits to the developing world and undermined the traditional support base of the Democratic Party.44 33Such quarrels over the meaning and direction of the protest movement illustrate how the struggle over legitimate representation is one of the most pivotal political challenges faced by global protests movements. Indeed, representation is, as Ankersmit stresses, at the heart of politics.45 But how is one to establish appropriate standards and rules of enforcement for a protest movement that is all about defying conventional mechanisms and boundaries of politics ? 34The most accepted standards of legitimate representation are democratic principles. The political legitimatisation process in the modern state is largely built around electoral accountability and the various legal and institutional frameworks that surround it. But democratic principles cannot easily be applied to transnational protest movements and their engagement with multilateral institutions. Democracy, as we know it, is intrinsically linked to the territorial boundaries of the nation state and its key political institutions. William Connolly correctly notes that &amp;#34;it is probably impossible even to imagine a form of democratic politics today that breaks entirely with this model of the territorial imaginary.&amp;#34;46 But Connolly also recognises the rapidly changing dynamics of globalisation, the fact that virtually all aspects of life transgress the boundaries of sovereign states, from the flow of capital and labour to criminal organisations, media networks and protest movements. &amp;#34;Only democratic citizens,&amp;#34; he stresses, &amp;#34;remain locked behind the bars of the state.&amp;#34;47 35The challenge, then, consists of finding a way of extending democratic accountability to the struggle over the direction of global governance and the various political, social and economic dynamics associated with it. While such a project may well be impossible to imagine today, Connolly points in a promising direction. He approaches democracy not only as a set of political institutions, but also, and perhaps even primarily, as an ethos, a cultural disposition. This ethos, Connolly stresses, needs to &amp;#34;foster a recurrent problematization of final markers&amp;#34; - foundational norms which continue to reinstate themselves.48 In the context of the struggle over global governance, such a democratic approach would entail regular public scrutiny and discussion of how norms, values and institutions function. Necessary as well would be a more generic promotion of transparency and an awareness of the political dimensions of representation, that is, sensitivity to who or what is excluded and included, and why. 36In some ways, the activists in Seattle can only speak for themselves. But this does not mean that they cannot engage political problems and criticise, say, issues related to economic governance or North-South relations. In fact, the process of convincing others across political, cultural and linguistic divides is the very subject of politics. Indeed, the most effective target of activism in the information age may well be the people with the spending power to influence politics. Comfortably installed in front of their television sets, this target audience does not usually suffer from unequal globalisation. In fact, they are the ones who profit from existing political dynamics.49 By questioning political, social and economic privileges, and by disturbing the stable foundations upon which these privileges rest, the protest movement is able to contribute to a democratisation of global governance, even if it cannot always perfectly represent all people affected by unequal globalisation processes. The Importance of Form : Violent versus Nonviolent Protests  37The form and method of representation can be as significant as its content. The protest events in Seattle, Washington, Prague, Melbourne, Quebec, Gothenburg, Davos and Genoa are good examples. Without doing injustice to the uniqueness and complexities of each event, it is fair to say that most of them proceeded in a comparable way : the overwhelming majority of protesters engaged in a variety of peaceful and nonviolent forms of protest, while a small minority committed acts of violence.50 At times, as in Seattle, molotov cocktails and battles with riot police led to looting and the destruction of property. Media attention, in turn, focused often on these violent incidents, leading to a relatively uneven representation of the overall protests. The latter, violent episodes have attracted by far the most media attention, overshadowing both the substance of the protests and the presence of an overwhelmingly violent majority of dissidents. The violent nature of recent protests against globalisation pose a number of key questions for both social movement agency and politics in general. What is the exact nature and impact of violence ? To what extent can violence be justified as an act of dissent ? Is violence an effective way of promoting social change ? How can peaceful activists who engage in nonviolent protests or civil disobedience co-exist with those who advocate violence as a revolutionary strategy ? Do they belong to the same movement ? Do their different engagements reinforce or hinder each other ? 38To engage these difficult questions it is necessary to enter terrains that are both analytical and normative. Consider one of the organisers of the Prague protests, a young Czech chemistry student. In principle she is against the use of violence, but believes that &amp;#34;at times it is nevertheless legitimate.&amp;#34; When talking about the actions in Prague, she insist on drawing a distinction between different forms of violence : &amp;#34;Violence committed by demonstrators against objects ; violence committed by the police against demonstrators, and, worst of all, violence committed by institutions like the IMF and the World Bank that rob millions of people of their livelihood.&amp;#34;51 She is not alone in drawing such a distinction. &amp;#34;They are worried about a few windows being smashed,&amp;#34; said a Philippino participant in the Seattle protests. &amp;#34;They should come and see the violence being done to our communities in the name of liberalization of trade.&amp;#34;52 39The debate between violent and nonviolent forms of protest is, of course, not new. Frantz Fanon had already argued that violence is inevitable if existing structures of power - as those of colonialism - are being challenged and overthrown.53 It is an integral part of social change. Others disagree. They advocate nonviolent forms of dissent, basing their positions on a long tradition of thought and activism that stretches back to the words and deeds of Henry David Thoreau, Leo Tolstoy, Mohandas Gandhi and Martin Luther King, to name just a few key figures.54 They consciously employ nonviolent forms of protest when the official channels for political action, such as elections, referenda, petitions or lobbying do not exist or are considered inadequate for the resolution of the conflict in question. Nonviolent action thus seeks to empower those who do not have access to conventional forms of political influence. While such actions usually occur only in desperate circumstances, they are not necessarily manifestation of powerlessness, as Jonathan Freedland suggested with respect to the events in Seattle.55 40Nonviolent dissent can also be seen as an effective resistance strategy in itself. Indeed, the choice of nonviolent over violent protest is considered not only a moral, but also a strategic decision - a decision for the more sound and efficient form of struggle. Richard Gregg, in a classical study on the subject, suggests that nonviolence works by way of producing a change of mental attitude in the mind of those against whom the action is directed. Nonviolent action thus works not unlike military strategies, for it seeks to « to demoralize the opponent, to break his will, to destroy his confidence, enthusiasm and hope. »56 But instead of using violence to counter violence, which would only drain the resisters&amp;#39; energy and reassure the attacker about the adequacy of the chosen method of repression, nonviolence is considered to be a more effective form of political intervention. Some recent studies have found mixed evidence about the ability of nonviolent action to change the position of its opponents. Instead, they stress that nonviolence can engender social change by influencing third parties.57 41This is where the debate over the politics of protest actions becomes explicitly strategic and tactical. The issues at stake are well illustrated by how activists differ about the point at which an action does and perhaps should become violent. Some non-violent activists reserve the right to employ violent means for reasons of self-defence. They argue that they have a moral right to self-protection, perhaps even to physical responses, if attacked by the police.58 Others disagree. They advocate a more principled adherence to nonviolence, and this for ethical and, above all, for strategic and tactical reasons. The classical example here is Gandhi, who urged his fellow activists to adhere to strict principles of nonviolence. He called off a protest march as soon as the slightest acts of violence were committed by activists. For him this was necessary because the power of nonviolence is located in its manipulative potential, in its ability to convert the opponent or third parties. Nonviolence, then, is seen as a psychological weapon, an intervention that causes emotional and moral perturbations which in turn trigger processes of social change. It seeks a conversation with the consciousness of the opponent and the public at large. Violent acts of protest generally fail to reach this objective, Gandhi argued. Principled nonviolence, by contrast, can be an exceptionally effective means. Recall the moment when Gandian activist were beaten by the police without attempting any form of retaliation. It remains one of the most striking and powerful images of the resistance movement against Britain&amp;#39;s colonial occupation of India. Striking because these images capture an ethical and political commitment that can hardly be matched. Powerful because they manage to initiate forces of transformation that violent acts never can : they evoke pity which, in turn, can either convert the opponent or generate public pressure that can lead to a process of accommodation.59 A similar position has recently been advanced by Amartya Sen, who argued that the ant-globalisation protest would be fare more effective if it were to employ not violence, but humour as a strategy of dissent and transformation.60 42The verdict of Seattle on the issue of violence and nonviolence is mixed. On the one hand, violence attracts fare more media attention than nonviolence does. In a world were entertainment and information are intrinsically linked, a molotov cocktail or a street fight between protesters and police offers far more spectacular and attractive &amp;#39;news&amp;#39; material than does a peaceful protest march. On the other hand, this media attention is gained at a certain price. Recall that the main purpose of the protest, and of the ensuing media spectacle, was to draw attention to the undersides of globalisation and to win the hearts and minds of global television audiences. This is where the dissident event could leave its most enduring impact on the policy debates that surround globalisation. The fact that the evens in Seattle turned violent, however, gave critics an easy target : the protesters could now be dismissed as disgruntled youths or demonised as dangerous anarchist radicals who are not in tune with the needs and wishes of the general populace.61 This is why some commentators were able to speak dismissively of a &amp;#34;counter-culture carnival,&amp;#34;62 of the &amp;#34;globetrotting anti-globalisation mob,&amp;#34;63 of &amp;#34;hippies and yippies&amp;#34; with their &amp;#34;bedraggled beards and their mobiles phones hooked up to the internet.&amp;#34;64 It is also unlikely that violence which leads to the destruction of property can win over the sympathy of the public, especially in the US where, as one commentator puts it, &amp;#34;private property is God.&amp;#34;65 These issues are central not only to the political foundations of global activism, but also to its tactical and strategic efficiency. 43The terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 have further highlighted the crucial relationship between violence and dissent. Consider the World Economic Forum of February 2002, which was held in New York rather than Davos. The significant presence of protesters both in New York and at the alternative World Social Forum in Porto Alegre revealed that opposition to free-market oriented globalisation remains strong. But the strategic dimensions of dissent have changed fundamentally. It would have been a major public relations disaster for protesters to embark on a violent street fight with members of the New York police, who are considered the heroes of 9.11. Many protest groups that stress strict adherence to nonviolence thus stayed away from New York. And those that went to Porto Alegre faced the challenge of articulating some sort of common manifesto, one that seeks to articulate, as one commentator puts it, &amp;#34;a methodology of protest that distinguishes them from terrorists, bloody revolutionaries and bomb-throwing malcontents.&amp;#34;66 44The prime challenge for activists now consists of attracting media attention without resorting to violence, which ultimately undermines the ability to gain public support for their cause. To do so successfully, the location of protest may well have to move away from the major meetings of multilateral economic institutions. The risk that small acts of violence undermine a large and carefully planned nonviolent protest may simply be too high. Boycotts and innovative local actions, for instance, could prove to be more effective locations for protest. They would not attract the same spectacular, but in the long run such persistent actions may have more success in influencing the value system that sustains current practices of global economic governance. Conclusion : Democracy, Ambiguity and the Struggle over Global Governance  45An extensive and broadly conceived engagement with political issues is crucial if the global dissident movement is to contribute to the construction of a better world, rather than merely oppose existing policies. To engage this problematique the present essay has first demonstrated that globalisation does not necessarily, or at least not only, lead to a centralisation of power and a corresponding loss of democratic participation and political accountability. Taking the anti-WTO protest actions in Seattle as a case in point, the essay has argued that globalisation has also increased the potential to engage in acts of dissent that can subvert the very processes of control and homogenisation. In doing so, the essay counters images of a hyperreal world, of an increasingly shallow and media dominated globe in which nothing can penetrate beneath the surface. Political dissent, according to this doomsday scenario, becomes all but impossible, for there is nothing left to dissent against. There is only a twenty-for-hour-a-day-blur of information and entertainment. We are caught in a world that resembles J.G. Ballard&amp;#39;s Eden-Olympia : a financially thriving but highly unequal high-tech information society, seemingly run by a few successful elites, but in reality spinning out of control and spiralling into an ever deeper moral void, fed by the very need for progress and economic expansion.67 46While engendering a series of problematic processes, globalisation has also increased the possibility to engage political issues. Before the advent of speed, for instance, a protest event was a mostly local issue. But the presence of global media networks has fundamentally changed the dynamics and terrains of dissent. Political activism no longer takes place solely in the streets of Prague, Seoul or Asuncion. The Battle for Seattle, for instance, was above all a media spectacle, a battle for the hearts and minds of global television audiences. Political activism, wherever it occurs and whatever form it takes, has become intrinsically linked with the non-spatial logic of speed. It has turned into a significant transnational phenomena. 47With the exploration of new terrains of dissent, global activists also face a series of political dilemmas. This essay has addressed two of them : the tension between violent and nonviolent means of resistance, and the issue of unequal representation, the question of who can speak for whom. Rather than suggesting that these issues can be understood and solved by applying a pre-existing body of universal norms and principles, the essay has drawn attention to the open-ended and contingent nature of the puzzles in question. Protest acts against the key multilateral institutions of the world economy will continue, and so will debates about the nature of globalisation and the methods of interfering with its governance. Keeping these debates alive, and seeking to include as many voices, perspectives and constituencies as possible, is a first step towards something that may one day resemble globalisation with a human face. 48But making global governance more humane, more transparent and more democratic is no easy task. Principles of transparency and democracy have historically been confined to the territorial boundaries of the sovereign nation state. Within these boundaries there is the possibility for order and the rule of law. But the space beyond is seen as threatening and anarchical - that is, lacking a central regulatory institution. The standard realist response to these perceptions is well know : protect sovereignty, order and civility at the domestic level by promoting policies that maximise the state&amp;#39;s military capacity and, so it is assumed, its security.68 It is questionable to what extent realist policies remain adequate - and ethical for that matter - at a time when process of globalisation have lead to a fundamental transformation of political dynamics. 49The Battle for Seattle, and the media spectacle that issued form it, may well demonstrate that the struggle for power takes place in a realm that lacks a central regulatory institution. But realist interpretations make the mistake of embarking on a fatalistic interpretation of this political realm, constituting conflict as an inevitable element of the system&amp;#39;s structure. It may be more adequate - and certainly more productive - to characterise the international system in the age of globalisation and transnational dynamics not as anarchical, but as rhizomatic. For Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari a rhizome is a multiplicity that has no coherent and bounded whole, no beginning or end, only a middle from where it expands and overspills. Any point of the rhizome is connected to any other. It has no fixed points to anchor thought, only lines, magnitudes, dimensions, plateaus, and they are always in motion.69 How, then, is one to reach a moral position in a world of webs, multitudes and multiplicities ? Are the lines, dimensions and plateaus of the rhizome so randomly arranged that we are no longer able to generate the kind of stable knowledge that is necessary to advance critique and, indeed, dissent ? Is the very notion of political foundations still possible at a time when social consciousness gushes out of five-second sound-bites and the corresponding hyperreal images that flicker over our television screens ? Are there alternatives to realist approaches that protect domestic order by warding off everything that threatens it from the outside ? Answers to such questions do, of course, not come easy. And they may not be uniform either. But an adequate response will need to engage in one way or another with the search for political engagements beyond the territorial boundaries of the nation state. 50An extension of democratic principles into the more ambiguous international realm is as essential as it is difficult. It will need to be based on a commitment to democracy that goes beyond the establishment of legal and institutional procedures. William Connolly has pointed in the right direction when arguing for a democratic ethos. The key to such cultural democratisation, he believes, &amp;#34;is that it embodies a productive ambiguity at its very centre, always resisting attempts to allow one side or the other to achieve final victory.&amp;#34;70 Such a model is, of course, the antithesis of prevailing realist wisdom, and perhaps of modern attitudes in general, which seek to achieve security and democracy through the establishment of order and the repression of all ambiguity.71 51Rather than posing a threat to human security, the rhizomatic dimension of the international system may well be a crucial element in the attempt to establish a democratic ethos that can keep up with the pace of globalisation. Some aspects of democratic participation can never be institutionalised. Any political system, no matter how just and refined, rests on a structure of exclusion. It has to separate right from wrong, good from evil, moral from immoral. This separation is both inevitable and desirable. But to remain legitimate the respective political foundations need to be submitted to periodic scrutiny. They require constant readjustments in order to remain adequate and fair. It is in the struggle for fairness, in the attempt to question established norms and procedures, that global protest movements, problematic as they are at times, make an indispensable contribution to democratic politics. 52The political significance of protest movments is located precisely in the fact that they cannot be controlled by a central regulatory force or an institutional framework. They open up possibilities for social change that are absent within the context of the established legal and political system.72 The various movements themselves are, of course, far from unproblematic. The violent nature of recent actions against neo-liberal governance may well point towards the need for greater political awareness among activists. But such awareness can neither be imposed by legal norms or political procedures. It needs to emerge from the struggle over values that takes place in civil society. The fact that this struggle is ongoing does not detract from the positive potential that is hidden in the movement&amp;#39;s rhizomatic nature. These elements embody the very ideal of productive ambiguity that may well be essential for the long-term survival of democracy.

The 1nc embodies a form of argumentation that comes from the position from nowhere – an abstract Eurocentric base for white supremacy
Yancy 2005 Journal of Speculative Philosophy, 19.4 (2005) 215-241

I write out of a personal existential context. This context is a profound source of knowledge connected to my “raced” body. Hence, I write from a place of lived embodied experience, a site of exposure. In philosophy, the only thing that we are taught to “expose” is a weak argument, a fallacy, or someone’s “inferior” reasoning power. The embodied self is bracketed and deemed irrelevant to theory, superfluous and cumbersome in one’s search for truth. It is best, or so we are told, to reason from nowhere. Hence, the white philosopher/author presumes to speak for all of “us” without the slightest mention of his or her “raced” identity. Self-consciously writing as a white male philosopher, Crispin Sartwell observes:¶ Left to my own devices, I disappear as an author. That is the “whiteness” of my authorship. This whiteness of authorship is, for us, a form of authority; to speak (apparently) from nowhere, for everyone, is empowering, though one wields power here only by becoming lost to oneself. But such an authorship and authority is also pleasurable: it yields the pleasure of self-forgetting or apparent transcendence of the mundane and the particular, and the pleasure of power expressed in the “comprehension” of a range of materials. (1998, 6)¶ To theorize the Black body one must “turn to the Black body as the radix for interpreting racial experience” (Johnson 1993, 600).1 It is important to note that this particular strategy also functions as a lens through which to theorize and critique whiteness; for the Black body’s “racial” experience is fun- damentally linked to the oppressive modalities of the “raced” white body. How- ever, there is no denying that my own “racial” experiences or the social performances of whiteness can become objects of critical reflection. In this pa- per, my objective is to describe and theorize situations where the Black body’s subjectivity, its lived reality, is reduced to instantiations of the white imaginary, resulting in what I refer to as “the phenomenological return of the Black body.” 2 These instantiations are embedded within and evolve out of the complex social and historical interstices of whites’ efforts at self-construction through complex acts of erasure vis-à-vis Black people. These acts of self-construction, however, are myths/ideological constructions predicated upon maintaining white power. As James Snead has noted, “Mythification is the replacement of history with a surrogate ideology of white elevation or Black demotion along a scale of human value” (Snead 1994, 4).

You’ve conflated the intentions of our authors with western visual-optics – for non-western cultures visions do not have to be told from the perspective of the seeing. Black elk’s visions are the most telling no link. Do not judge the aff’s use of the term ‘vision’ by western language standards.

The first thing to be pointed out is that “worldview” is a European idea, specifi cally German (Weltanschauung = world looked-at also ideology). So we must recognize initially that in speaking of an Indigenous worldview we may have already generated an egregiously distorted account, determined in advance by a European bias that gives priority to seeing and vision. Much of European-Western theory of knowledge and reality occurs under the aegis of a tacit or explicit visual-optical metaphor. To know or grasp something is to “see the point.” But for the human organism, seeing and vision is the distancing and detaching sense par excellence: the sense in which we are least involved as whole bodies, least involved emotionally and existentially in whole environments over the long term (thus, for example, the perversion of voyeurism). This approach may be appropriate within the sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Western scientifi c project of narrowing down to particular cogs within “the world machine” (for example, Newton’s “celestial mechanics”). But the price paid is that knowers must mask out the whole emotional and cosmical context within which knowing and living occur. If this is not recognized initially, the masking-out will be paved over and forgotten. The habitual boring and focusing, the “normal” partializing and fracturing, will be concealed, the initial assumptions concealed, and the concealing concealed. We will be oblivious of the possibility of other “worldviews,” other ways of grasping, living, and behaving in the world. “There is only one right way.” This is no mere matter for the philosophy classroom. Because of contemporary clashes between cultures animated by very different “worldviews,” and because of current weapons and communications technologies widely spread, we face the possible or probable extinction of life on our planet. If we can, we must grasp the bias and limitation of the West’s worldview, which powers, focuses, tunnels United States power aiming at hegemony, all oblivious of other worldviews and visions, for instance Native American or Islamic. As already suggested, the bias and limitation of the contemporary North American worldview is from the start built into the European notion of worldview itself: that is, the world as viewed, as the seen, the visual (and the visual-ideological). This deeply masks out the fact that fundamental components of a culture’s way of thinking and being in the world are not visual at all, not accessible to vision at any moment or through any sequence of moments (Augenblick in German: blink of the eye). As William James wrote in Lecture II of the Varieties of Religious Experience: Religion, whatever it is, is a man’s total reaction upon life, so why not say that any total reaction upon life is a religion? Total reactions are different from casual reactions, and total attitudes are different from usual or professional attitudes. To get at them you must go behind the foreground of existence and reach down to that curious sense of the whole residual cosmos as an everlasting presence, intimate or alien, terrible or amusing, lovable or odious, which in some degree every one possesses. This sense of the world’s presence . . . involuntary and inarticulate and often half unconscious as it is, is the completest of all our answers to the question, “What is the character of the universe in which we dwell?”2 The “whole push and pressure of the residual cosmos”—as he sometimes puts it (other times it’s “circumpressure”)—is not an exclusively visual matter, not by a long shot. It’s an experience of being always already carried along in a tide of events funded from the past and fl owing obscurely and powerfully into the present and future. It is a people’s living traditions of being, knowing, doing, and cannot be framed in a visual snapshot or glimpse, or any series of snapshots or glimpses, no matter how vivid. It is built into the whole bodies of the culture’s members as they are carried along in their habitual perceptual stances, practices, rites, interrelationships. This is infi nitely more than “seeing no matter how many points” intellectually and in an emotionally detached way. Black Elk’s healing visions cannot be understood only visually. They may occur in a coma. Funded and mobilized in the healer’s body are the practices of his people over countless generations. For example, in what John Neihardt transcribes as Black Elk’s fi rst cure, the healer places the sick boy at the northeastern sector of the inside of the teepee, the direction from which comes “the cold wind of the north that teaches endurance”— which has taught this to his Lakota people from time immemorial. The climactic moment of the cure is emphatically nonvisual: Black Elk places his mouth on the boy’s abdomen and “sucks the cold wind that teaches endurance” through his body. When Black Elk repeatedly exhorts his people to “follow the good red road,” he enjoins them to walk it, not just to look at it, or to form accurate propositions about it “in their minds.”3

Western metaphysics cements occularcentricism
Werry, 2009 (Chris, “Language as Vision: The ocularcentrism of Comskyan linguistics,” February 11, http://rhetoric.sdsu.edu/lore/2_2/werry_vis.html)

Chomsky also equates the perspective of the Martian with the vantage point afforded the child acquiring language.  He writes that ‘from the Martian point of view,’ as well as from ‘a child’s point of view,’ languages are ‘essentially identical’ (Chomsky 1995b).  Chomsky argues that “languages must look identical from the child’s point of view”, since ‘otherwise it’s impossible to learn any.’  The speed and precision with which children pick up new words “leaves no real alternative to the conclusion that the child somehow has the concepts available before experience with language and is basically learning labels for concepts that are already part of his or her conceptual apparatus.”56 Like God and the Martian, the child is represented as encountering language in an idealized, pristine form, his ‘knowledge’ of language untainted by experience and bodily realization.  In each case a universal, totalizing vision constitutes idealized knowledge of language, and connects us to the truth as it distances us from the body, history, culture and society.  Objectivity, certainty and knowledge of the ideal are associated with the visual apprehension of an object by a transcendental subjectivity.57  Chomskyan linguistics thus privileges what Nietzsche describes as ‘an eye outside time and history, an eye that no living being can imagine, an eye required to have no direction, to abrogate its active and interpretive powers’.58  Rorty notes that Western philosophy is characterized by the visualist ‘wish to see the world from above… as spectator of time and eternity,’ and has sought to constitute itself as a ‘discipline which lets us stand over and against the world of everyday practice by seeing it as God sees it, as a limited whole.”59  Chomskyan linguistics is characterized by similar aspirations, and is animated by a similar set of root metaphors.  Chomsky’s descriptions of idealized knowers are permeated with the language of spectatorial epistemology – ‘observation’, ‘perspective,’ ‘point of view,’ ‘look,’ ‘see,’ ‘focus,’ etc.  In the examples above, and in much of the rest of his work, knowledge is figuratively characterized as a visual enterprise.  The object of inquiry, language, is represented in correspondingly ocular terms, and is assigned many of the same characteristics, including disengagement, objectivity, disembodiment, certainty and universality.

Aff comes first - critical to challenging the epistemic bases that form ableism
Byrd 11 (Jodi A., (Chickasaw), assistant professor of American Indian studies and English at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, The Transit of Empire: Indigenous Critiques of Colonialism, pg. xvii)
There is more than one way to frame the concerns of The Transit of Empire and more than one way to enter into the possibilities that transit might allow for comparative studies. On the one hand, I am seeking to join ongoing conversations about sovereignty, power, and indigeneity—and the epistemological debates that each of these terms engender—within and across disparate and at times incommensurable disciplines and geographies. American studies, queer studies, postc olonial studies, American Indian studies, and area studies have all attempted to apprehend injury and redress, melancholy and grief that exist in the distances and sutures of state recognitions and belongings. Those distances and sutures of recognitions and belongings, melancholy and grief, take this book from the worlds of Southeastern Indians to Hawai&amp;#39;i, from the Poston War Relocation Center to Jonestown, Guyana, in order to consider how ideas of “Indianness” have created conditions of possibility for U. S. empire to manifest its intent. As liberal multicultural settler colonialism attempts to flex the exceptions and exclusions that first constituted the United States to now provisionally include those people othered and abjected from the nation-states origins, it instead creates a cacophony of moral claims that help to deflect progressive and transformative activism from dismantling the ongoing conditions of colonialism that continue to make the United States a desired state formation within which to be included. That cacophony of competing struggles for hegemony within and outside institutions of power, no matter how those struggles might challenge the state through loci of race, class, gender, and sexuality, serves to misdirect and cloud attention from the underlying structures of settler colonialism that made the United States possible as oppressor in the first place. As a result, the cacophony produced through U.S. colonialism and imperialism domestically and abroad often coerces struggles for social justice for queers, racial minorities, and immigrants into complicity with settler colonialism. This book, on the other hand, is also interested in the quandaries poststructuralism has left us: the traces of indigenous savagery and “Indianness” that stand a priori prior to theorizations of origin, history, freedom, constraint, and difference.3 These traces of “Indianness” are vitally important to understanding how power and domination have been articulated and practiced by empire, and yet because they are traces, they have often remained deactivated as a point of critical inquiry as theory has transited across disciplines and schools. Indianness can be felt and intuited as a presence, and yet apprehending it as a process is difficult, if not impossible, precisely because Indianness has served as the field through which structures have always already been produced. Within the matrix of critical theory, Indianness moves not through absence but through reiteration, through meme, as theories circulate and fracture, quote and build. The prior ontological concerns that interpellate Indianness and savagery as ethnographic evidence and example, lamentable and tragic loss, are deferred through repetitions. How we have come to know intimacy, kinship, and identity within an empire born out of settler colonialism is predicated upon discourses of indigenous displacements that remain within the present everydayness of settler colonialism, even if its constellations have been naturalized by hegemony and even as its oppressive logics are expanded to contain more and more historical experiences. 1 hope to show through the juridical, cultural, and literary readings within this book that indigenous critical theory provides alternatives to the entanglements of race and colonialism, intimacy and relationship that continue to preoccupy poststructuralist and postcolonial studies.


Your singling out against metaphors reifies the domination that you oppose. Your counterplan solves nothing.

Associate Professor, University of Pittsburgh School of Law; B.A. (Juris.), Oxford University, 1983; LL.B., Dalhousie University, 1984; LL.M., University of Toronto, 1986; LL.M., Harvard Law School, 1988. “MAKING SENSE OF METAPHORS: VISUALITY, AURALITY, AND THE RECONFIGURATION OF AMERICAN LEGAL DISCOURSE.” 16 Cardozo L. Rev. 229. December, 1994.-AC
Apart from what is likely to happen, one might argue that a complete shift from visual to aural figures of legal speech in American legal discourse would be inadvisable, even for those persons who have thus far gained or been empowered by the increased popularity of aural legal metaphors. In the guise of liberating and validating the relatively more aural experiences of individuals from traditionally marginalized American gender, racial, ethnic, and religious groups, such a transformation might ironically do much to legitimate and validate the circumstances of their marginalization. For instance, when feminist legal scholars embrace aural metaphors such as &amp;#34;dialogue&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;conversation,&amp;#34; are they not coining *353 a legal language in large part born of the very conditions of subordination and oppression that they seek to challenge and change? Do not their words - for all their obvious appeal - at some level accept and endorse the sensory limitations that others (in this instance, men) have traditionally imposed on them? n716 In this context, the true liberation of individuals from marginalized backgrounds arguably requires that they not arbitrarily limit themselves to - or preemptively define themselves by - aural metaphors that others have in some sense chosen for them. n717Undue reliance on aural metaphors might even distance outsider legal theorists from other important aspects of their own cultural histories and experiences. No human culture - however constituted - is ever completely visual or aural, and we all run the risk of misunderstanding and distorting ourselves if we try to redefine the world - or law - along a single sensory line. Here, the historical experience of male, white, Anglo, and Protestant Americans may serve as both a lesson and a warning: in allowing themselves to have been drawn so strongly to visuality, many individuals from these backgrounds have largely forgotten or failed to appreciate the not-insignificant degrees of aurality inherent in their own traditions - an aurality which they are only now rediscovering in an increasingly aural age. Their extreme indulgence of the visual has thus come at a critical cost not only to others, but to themselves.

The counter-advocacy can’t solve on its own, visual and aural metaphors are still necessary to transform parts of the world.

Rev. 229. December, 1994.-AC
If American legal language is being reconfigured today, however, what is to prevent it from being transformed tomorrow? Why should the incipient trend I have here identified and discussed not continue to the point where, in the future, the domination of aural legal metaphors becomes as overwhelming as the domination of visual legal metaphors was yesterday?Here, one might offer several answers. First, it may be argued that insofar as legal metaphors are shaped by circumstance, neither *352 American culture nor American law will probably be able to sustain a complete or near-complete transition to aurally based legal language. n715 Aural technology may have surged in the last century or so, but as I have repeatedly noted in this Article, visual technology has hardly stood still for it. The same age which has given us the telephone, the radio, and the tape recorder has also given us inexpensive photography, motion pictures, television, and the computer. The last three of these &amp;#34;visual&amp;#34; technologies have actually joined sound to sight, promoting a trend towards sensory synthesis that has culminated in today&amp;#39;s &amp;#34;multimedia&amp;#34; technology. In this new environment, American culture is likely to embrace both sight and sound rather than encourage a definitive turn from one sense to the other. By the same token, it is not likely to generate or support a legal discourse that would consistently prefer aural over visual metaphors. The likelihood of metaphoric transformation is decreased even further by the certainty that the composition of the American legal academy (not to mention the American legal profession) will in the foreseeable future remain mixed along a variety of gender, racial, ethnic, and religious lines, thereby ensuring the continued participation in American legal discourse of individuals coming from a variety of relatively more visual and relatively more aural traditions. Insofar as individuals of all backgrounds remain willing and able to draw consciously or subconsciously on their own historical experiences for intellectual inspiration, it is likely that some will continue to favor visual legal metaphors, while others will turn to aural legal language. Diversity will allow for difference.



Your alternative creates a static conception about metaphors that enables them to be exclusionary – our permutation embraces the use of visual metaphors and aural metaphors and provides maximum solvency
Bernard J. Hibbitts in 94. Associate Professor, University of Pittsburgh School of Law; B.A. (Juris.), Oxford University, 1983; LL.B., Dalhousie University, 1984; LL.M., University of Toronto, 1986; LL.M., Harvard Law School, 1988. “MAKING SENSE OF METAPHORS: VISUALITY, AURALITY, AND THE RECONFIGURATION OF AMERICAN LEGAL DISCOURSE.” 16 Cardozo L. Rev. 229. December, 1994.-AC

A complete shift from visual to aural legal metaphors is moreover unnecessary, even to accomplish or propel the value changes that exponents of critical legal theory in particular may desire. It is true that we have traditionally regarded the values associated with sound as more compatible with critical legal theory than the values associated with sight. This would seem to suggest that visual legal metaphors are almost by definition inadequately expressive of critical ideas and therefore deserve rejection by critical theorists. One *354 must wonder, however, whether the perceived shortcomings of visual legal metaphors are due to some inherent &amp;#34;essence&amp;#34; of visuality or whether they are simply a function of how we have traditionally understood sight. Perhaps sight does not have a phenomenological essence. n718 Perhaps it embraces a multiplicity of contradictory values - values which are brought out by different visual media. For instance, perhaps it is our dependence on the visual medium of writing that encourages us (although it certainly does not force us) to believe that sight abstracts, disengages, and objectifies. Writing tends to cut us off from the physical world; traditionally conceived, it facilitates the separation and mutual noninvolvement of writer and reader, and it enables the reader to assess visual information without being burdened by the presence and personality of the writer. But what if - perhaps under the impetus of television, film, and video technology - one were to understand sight more through the lens, say, of gesture? n719 In those circumstances, might not &amp;#34;sight&amp;#34; be considered to favor dynamism, multivariance, relation, and subjectivism? n720 Would not a focus on gesture give vision a meaning in time? Would not the visual perception and interpretation of movement facilitate the recognition of multiple &amp;#34;truths&amp;#34;? n721 Would not its personalized energy and power invite reciprocation? n722 Would it not facilitate the association of message and mes *355 senger? n723 If these things are so, then perhaps sight and, by implication, visual legal metaphors, are in the abstract potentially compatible with critical theory. By the same token, a total embrace of aural legal metaphor might not be sufficient to the purpose of promoting the aims of critical legal theory. Perhaps sound too is ultimately without a phenomenological essence, regardless of the values that we currently associate with it. For instance, we regard sound as concrete, relational, subjective, and dynamic, but we may do so because we still envisage ourselves experiencing sound in the context of face-to-face encounters. What would happen, however, if we ceased thinking of sound in this traditional fashion, and under the influence of ongoing technological change began to view it (as we are increasingly coming to experience it) as a product of technology - a product of the radio, the television, the telephone, the tape recorder, and the computer. n724 It could be argued that this technologically based sound could easily embrace and implicitly support values very different from those that we have hitherto associated with the aural. n725 For instance, relative to face-to-face conversation, technologically based discourse radically distances and decontextualizes those who are party to it. Insofar as it can be unyielding, technological sound can cut off or preempt interaction rather than facilitate it. n726 In the same vein, technological sound is not necessarily subjectifying: indeed, the power of its electronic *356 amplification can make it brutally objectifying. n727 Finally, instead of being dynamic, technological sound can be static - something that can be frozen in time, manipulated, and transferred for replay. In this context, prominent aural legal metaphors such as &amp;#34;voice,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;speaking,&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;listening&amp;#34; (and even &amp;#34;dialogue&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;conversation&amp;#34;) that now seem unequivocally positive and supportive of the critical agenda may prove capable of evoking ambivalent or even negative values which would be fatal to their critical purpose. Arbitrarily limiting ourselves to aural figures of legal speech would therefore be as inadvisable as rejecting visual legal metaphors out of hand.It seems that into the foreseeable future, American legal discourse will - and, to avoid being painted into a cultural, sociological, or phenomenological corner, probably should - continue to embrace metaphors evoking sight as well as metaphors evoking sound. While we listen with new attention to the &amp;#34;voice&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;conversation&amp;#34; of the law, we can still &amp;#34;observe&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;review&amp;#34; it. In the long run, such an inclusive and potentially synergistic reconfiguration of American legal discourse will help to ensure that, in a new era, American law remains figuratively and literally sensible.

For generations, Oil has been King in Texas. Every job in the Dallas area was made possible through oil exploration. You can see its excesses everywhere: The Pony Express at SMU even Television shows like Dallas show ruthless Barons competing over control. All of our Debate Journeys begin from this point, some of our debate journeys started here in high school and inevitably they all revolved around the Dallas area. Dividing this massive Oil operation is I-35. I-35 connects the excesses of oil to its ugly underside. At one point or another, every team travels through Oklahoma on the way to the next tournament. Travel invokes a long history for Oklahoma and its transition from the former Indian Territory to the metropolitan area it is today. Travel also involves many Native American nations being thrown together and enclosed out of sight for the western world. For the Cherokee, this memory of travel is one of the violence of the trail of tears. Twenty-five years after removal started, the Cherokee nation made some discoveries that bore massive possibilities for the land, the American Oil and Gas Historical society credits the Cherokees writing that: http://aoghs.org/technology/first-oklahoma-oil-well/ 

In 1859, Lewis Ross, … Cherokee Nation.”

For 70 years following the trail of tears there was conflict and hostility throughout Oklahoma and the nation. Eventually life in Indian Territory came to a close as the United States federal government became resolved to open the land for expansion. The discovery of Oil in Indian Territory catalyzed this new drive to acquire and expand the territory culminating in the creation of the State of Oklahoma and the Land run. Boomers and Sooners raced across the land taking plots with several of them identifying and taking the land for its Oil reserves. Naturally, with expansion of business comes the expansion of corruption. Fast forwarding 80 years from the Land Run we meet Koch Industries.

If there were applications for admission.

It is fundamentally insufficient to offer a genuine affirmation of the resolution that merely states that a United States federal government should increase incentives for Wind energy in the United States. One of the downfalls of western thinking is its drive towards abstraction – it is in the context of the Native Nations of Oklahoma. To affirm the words of the resolution would merely be substituting old words with new words. We affirm the resolution not as a single idea for a policy action but as a vision of the possibility of new forms of thinking and orienting ourselves towards wind energy production in the United States as a challenge to the Oil industry. The problem of energy policy is the problem of western interpretation. We affirm a fundamental reorientation toward the topic toward the viewpoints of the multitude of Native American nations instead of the destructive over-consumptive habits of western culture. 

The distinction between an idea and a vision as well as the fundamental tenets of our approach to liberation are best explained by Vine Deloria Jr in 1999

Finally, Voting affirmative is an act of thinking that makes possible a new series of macronarratives to be highlighted. It changes the terms of the conversation instead of just the words we use. Your ballot does not have access to control over energy policy, but has control over the dissent you challenge the nuclear industry over.

When Corbin Harney closes with &amp;#34;they just don~’t have the time to save us&amp;#34; Cherokee author Andrea Smith contextualizes how you should situate your ethical response when she writes that


Unfortunately, while Habermas argues that the public sphere is fundamentally based on exclusion,

Smith 2005 ~~Andrea, Conquest: sexual violence and American Indian Genocide p 185-186


These are the questions that frame the winner and loser of this debate.

We read towards specific peoples in our debating: the Western Shoshone people and the Skull Valley Goshute people. We must recognize where we are. Our age is one of radioactive nation building. Mass technologies and the colonization of national imaginary has become a staple in the complex that has allowed for nuclear testing to poison our citizens and make native American communities of Utah and Nevada the most bombed nations on earth

MASCO 2006 ~~Joseph, The Nuclear Borderlands, 0691120773, p 25-27~~

The unprecedented national resources devoted to the bomb, its infrastructural role in everyday life
AND
life in the United States, and with them, new psychosocial realities.

Eventually the Nuclear complex decreased its favoritism toward nuclear testing. Today, Nuclear violence is now directed toward energy research – the same structures that stabilized the nuclear weapons industry have infused nuclear power research

In September 1992, Los Alamos scientists conducted what proved to be the last U

the mobilization of a named or unnamed, but always totalizing, threat.

Our Condemnation of these practices must understand the complexity of the recipient~’s choice or lack thereof. The Skull Valley Band of the Goshute is not a unanimous entity but are a nation full of dissent. Their leadership was faced with a forced choice: accept nuclear storage and the mass destruction of the surrounding environment or economically perish.

In reverence to the above criticisms made by several native americans about nuclear energy policy, we would like to begin the discussion of the question of structures of thinking and liberation. Deloria Jr. 1999
Vine Deloria Jr 1999 ~~Theologian, legal scholar, JD, Ph.D, M.Div, standing rock Sioux, For This Land, p101-102~~

If there were any serious concern about liberation we would see thousands of people simply 
AND
determine the racial background ofstudents on the basis of their applications for admission.


It is fundamentally insufficient to offer a genuine affirmation of the resolution that merely states 
AND
the topic as a vision of wind energy production in the United States.

The problem of energy policy is the problem of western interpretation. We affirm a fundamental reorientation toward the topic toward the viewpoints of the multitude of Native American nations instead of the destructive over consumptive habits of western culture. The distinction between an idea and a vision as well as the fundamental tenets of our approach to liberation are best explained by Vine Deloria Jr in 1999

An old Indian saying captures the radical difference between Indians and Western peoples quite adequately

We speak in our role of the ballot about the ethical response to Corbin Harney~’s call. Ethics is not bound to just our actions but our thinking and logical processes. We must refuse the logic that makes ethnocide and humiliation possible

Wind energies for native peoples embody an alternative knowledge and a new form of environmental justice that western economic development forecloses. It embodies technology as a resistance mechanism.

====1 – counter interpretation – the aff can defend either a topical idea or a topical vision. ====
a. Deloria says this maintains possibility for traditional plan affirmation and the ability to affirm a cultural perspective.

b. Voting aff embraces the multiplicity of interpretations for affirmation – we embrace a vision of the topic through affirming the possibility for alternate ways of thinking and approaching energy production. The 1ac is informed by multiple cultures and nations as they approach united states energy production on their sovereign lands. We affirm ways of thinking about changing energy policy from an other-thinking perspective.


====2 – this isn~’t impossible to debate -====
a. we make direct claims about energy production and indicate a change in mindset approach. 

b. There are multiple methods to wind energy that are good, multiple ways to negate the aff with defending the status quo or competing Ks. 

c. Do not judge this debate along the question of debatability but by which side is more inclusive of multiple perspectives about energy production.


====3. Knowledge DA– their debatability claims are based on negating an aff ideal that places a single purpose interpretation to the world – this reflects dominant exclusive ways of thinking that assumes reformism will correct status quo machinery into line – Deloria says this framework of interpretation inherently favors western mechanistic thinking and culture and makes impossible revolutionary change in thinking. These constructions of privileged claims to knowledge should be disavowed, we use our counterinterpetation to create a new synthesis of knowledge====

AND
we have previously used to begin our formulation of a picture of reality.


====The neg framework has no claim to their form of debate except history and tradition. Switch side debate is a drive to force a form of traditional interpretation along a singular coherent form of communication is inherently silencing to other perspectives. ====
Secomb 2000 (Linnell, a lecturer in Gender Studies at the University of Sydney, &amp;#34;Fractured Community&amp;#34; Hypatia-Volume 15, Number 2, Spring 2000, pp.138-139)~~-AC

the dominant modes of authoritative and rational conversation that assume homogeneity and transparency. 



====And, 4 - Vote affirmative to answer Corbin Harney~’s call, voting negative on framework functionally makes the judge the operator hanging up on the call or telling him to call another number. Voting for our interpretation makes time by interrupting the naturalized assumptions of the public sphere that structure the benefits of their impacts. Their framework preserves the possibility for colonial exclusion of anything that doesn~’t accommodate to their epistemological preference.====

====Switch side debate in the context of the aff forces debaters to take the position of the colonizer. You should be suspect to these claims to objectivity – it privileges western forms of thinking====

====The notion of finding a topical version replicates a boarding school mentality in its attempt to impose strict curriculum as behavioral modifications upon the indian mind in order to create the productive white citizen. Side with the possibility of change – their approach is dogmatic and denies creativity====

====1 - all of those above research turns are the net benefits to us generating new ways to approach energy policy - it creates the students as researchers and applications of our research instead of deferring to outside viewpoints. All of our arguments about universality oon framework are impact turns to the spec argument. ====


====2 - we also meet - we say energy frameworks should be organic. they can read disads and case turns as to why some forms of energy cannot work or would be bad for the people in the 1ac. they only lose pic ground but that is irrelevant given the amount of disad ground they are granted. Powell evidence proves thereis not a singular incentive but multiple knowledge bases that their spec argument forces a close out of. ====


====3 - their interpretation is arbitrary - we give disad links, no right to other forms of ground - there are a bunch of mechanisms that we said would occur that they can say are bad.====


====The process-oriented strategy undermines the product – individuals become vested in the means of policy-making and not in the outcomes – their focus on solvency undermines====
Van Oenen 2006 ~~Gijs, John Hopkins U, Theory %26 Event, 9:2, Eramus U.~~-AC
 
But more importantly, the official view or ~’ideology~’ underwriting interactivity denies that a shift 
AND
process now mainly realizes, its main ~’product~’, is involvement with itself.


====Their issacs evidence is an ineffective framing for the debate: it ignores possibility for new ways of thinking and guarantees continued exploitation of the planet.====
Singer 1990 ~~Joseph William, professor of law at boston university, september, symposium on the renaissance of pragmatism in american legal thought: comment: property and coercion in federal indian law: the conflict between critical and complacent pragmatism september, 1990 63 s. cal. l. rev. 1821~~
Complacent pragmatism uses unreflective common sense to make situated judgments. This version ofpragmatism fails

====Im going to make an explicit concession here – we are not going for the theoretical conditionality argument, we will concede the Sholock evidence from the 1nr – epistemic uncertainty – ie the absence of a hegemonic knowledge base ietheaff – has particular beefits in terms of questioning white America and arrogance and self deception that normativizes coalitions nad struggle efforts.
