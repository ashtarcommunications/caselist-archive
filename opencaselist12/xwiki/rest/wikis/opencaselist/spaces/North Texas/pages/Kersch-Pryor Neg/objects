APOCALYPSE VERSION&#xD;

The imagination of the apocalypse produces a banality of catastrophe that destroys ethical engagement by disenchanting politics and life from one another.

Evaluating our structures of thought is a paramount concern – thinking has material effects. The plan text is a replication of some of the most destructive formations of thinking in western history – their modification of energy policy reflects overconsumptive cultural formations and massive continuations of colonization on indigenous lands. Even attempts at benign energy formations like wind and solar leave massive destruction to native lands. Colonization becomes inherent in the practices of their energy politics

Sadly (for him), Peter Gleick, the researcher at issue, could have obtained a good deal of the information he sought through a request for Heartland’s 990, a tax document that non-profits have to provide to any who request it. Rather than going through legitimate channels to obtain what information he could or, better still, questioning the veracity of the initial document he received — and there were many reasons to question that document, among them the fact that it was delivered to him anonymously — using someone else’s name, a Heartland board member — he requested internal documents.

The report, drawn up by its national laboratories said that meeting this target presumed 
AND
if merely a minor percentage of that technical feasibility provides electricity when needed.
To be extremely optimistic, let’s assume that actual average output would be 25% of that projected installed capacity. In that case, the real output would be less than 5% of the country’s electricity, and more realistically, about half of even that amount under optimistic circumstances.
Output volatility due to wind’s intermittency varies greatly according to location and time of year, typically ranging from 0% to about 50%. Texas, one of the most promising wind energy states, averages about 16.8% of installed capacity, yet the Electric Reliability Council of Texas assigns a value of 10% due to unpredictability. Only about 20% of that capacity is generally available during peak demand periods (about 5:00pm), while average generation during off-peak time averages about 40% of capacity.
