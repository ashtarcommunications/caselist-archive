The affirmative is a replication of a universal concept of humanity structured through ignorance of the colonial difference. Energy policy begs a different question than just a mere focus on production and consumption. Energy is the structure, the life-blood for the enactment of Eurocentric ideals. Only delinking from this epistemology by abandoning reformist attempts can a new starting point for politics be opened.&#xD;

Further, the affirmative’s approach to technology and production is not neutral but reifies a core tenet of Euro-American Identity: its claim to technological superiority.

Evaluating our structures of thought is a paramount concern – thinking has material effects. The plan text is a replication of some of the most destructive formations of thinking in western history – their modification of energy policy reflects overconsumptive cultural formations and massive continuations of colonization on indigenous lands.

Existence has no foundation. The entire functional base of reality is absent. Nature does not exist. It is too imbedded with human interventions. Their understanding of how the natural world works is backwards due to past involvement in the environment. The plan is a retreat into the comfort of ecological salvation which is gone.
ZIZEK 2008 Slavoj, In defense of Lost causes, isbn: 9781844671083, p 442-4 

Along these lines, &amp;#34;terror&amp;#34; means accepting the fact … confidence . . .  is originally, a nd truly, always a relationship with reality as a natural totality: as Nature.

The entirety of post-politics risk management completely evacuates the radical potential of the status quo in favor of highlighting and guaranteeing the reactionary base of liberal hegemony to all solutions.

Stavrakakis 99 Yannis Stavrakakis, Visiting professor at the University of Essex, Lacan and the Political, pg.62-65

Fantasy supports reality This signified function of the nodal point is not, however, solely reduced to its discursive position. It … on the symptom is revealed, then the play—the relation—between the symptom and fantasy reveals itself as another mode of the play between the real and the symbolic/imaginary nexus producing reality.

The affirmative’s energy management replicates the closure of the post-political climate. Its ideological divisions take even the most emancipatory of demands and reduce them to mere technical outcomes devoid of political potetntial. It is not a true political space but rather an attempt to close off dissensus.

Slavoj Žižek and Chantal Mouffe, among others, define the post-political as a political formation that actually forecloses the political, …doing so, it does not translate Marx’s dictum for the contemporary period, but turns it into its radical travesty.

We must abandon the basis of the political inherent to the affirmative. The plan is misplaced intervention as part of the policy order – the alternative re-navigates the political possibilities of new actions by disavowing the tainted and old.

Karen Shimakawa (Professor University of California, Davis) 2004 The Things We Share: Ethnic Performativity and &amp;#34;Whatever Being&amp;#34;, The Journal of Speculative Philosophy 18.2 149-160
Elsewhere I&amp;#39;ve suggested that Asian Pacific Americanness (in mainstream representation) …is the event of an outside&amp;#34; (67, emphasis in original).

The affirmative cedes the power of inclusion to the law, which is based in metaphysics. Only if we stop giving law, this ability, will it cease to define what is right or wrong, what is included or what is excluded.
Zartaloudis 2005 Law and Critique v16:387-418

The report, drawn up by its national laboratories said that meeting this target presumed 
AND
if merely a minor percentage of that technical feasibility provides electricity when needed.
To be extremely optimistic, let’s assume that actual average output would be 25% of that projected installed capacity. In that case, the real output would be less than 5% of the country’s electricity, and more realistically, about half of even that amount under optimistic circumstances.
Output volatility due to wind’s intermittency varies greatly according to location and time of year, typically ranging from 0% to about 50%. Texas, one of the most promising wind energy states, averages about 16.8% of installed capacity, yet the Electric Reliability Council of Texas assigns a value of 10% due to unpredictability. Only about 20% of that capacity is generally available during peak demand periods (about 5:00pm), while average generation during off-peak time averages about 40% of capacity.

Evaluating our structures of thought is a paramount concern – thinking has material effects.

Even attempts at benign energy formations like wind and solar leave massive destruction to native lands. Colonization becomes inherent in the practices of their energy politics

All of our links are disads to the permutation that prove the epistemology of the affirmative is tainted – this alternative doesn~’t function by overcoming the status quo but by refusing the universalism of the western narrative, utilization of their epistemology serves to continue the status quo.&#xD;
&#xD;
And, your permutation is merely the same attempt to continue the western frame of thinking. The attempt at making minor epistemic adjustments via reforms is not enough. We need a radical epistemological re-evaluation.&#xD;

Further, the alternative is a sequencing question – before we can effectively engage we have to have the questioning of the epistemology of the aff. Two pieces of mignolo evidence prove the need to remove the base epistemic foundation of the plan.&#xD;

Prefer the alternative over the permutation – their permutation serves the interest of expediency. we are the only ones with comparative evidence about questioning and political expediency in the context of western epistemology&#xD;

There is evidence that marine organisms and ecosystems are resilient to environmental change. Steele (1991) hypothesized that the biological components of marine systems are tightly coupled to physical factors, allowing them to respond quickly to rapid environmental change and thus rendering them ecologically adaptable. Some species also have wide genetic variability throughout their range, which may allow for adaptation to climate change.&#xD;

Crucial for a successful Ideology is thus the tension within its particular content between the &#xD;

AND&#xD;
, both direct and subversive, in the face of oppression and marginalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
====The affirmative is emblematic of further failures of the left who attempt to challenge the base of liberalism but don~’t reconcile the political underpinnings. There is no effective change possible through the system of debate.====&#xD;

Paradoxically, today~’s true conservatives are, rather, leftist ~’critical theorists~’ who reject both &#xD;

&#xD;
&#xD;
====Multicultural respect for particular groups perpetuates the hegemonic inevitability of capital by rendering it invisible and depoliticizing the economy====&#xD;
**Zizek 1999 ~~Slavoj, Senior Researcher at Institute for Social Studies, Ljubliana, The Ticklish Subject: the absent centre of political ontology, New York: Verso, 1999, 217-and 8~~**&#xD;

And, mutatis mutandis, the same goes for today~’s capitalist, who still clings &#xD;

====Failure to overcome this structural barrier prevents any radicality in the affirmative~’s method. There is no energy produced to changing debate, thingsmerely become enveloped into further pockets of tolerance.====&#xD;

====The narrative of the 1ac is thus only a function to describe the antagonisms below it, they do not paint a picture of resolution that enabls an overcoming of the violence toward the voices of the 1ca====&#xD;

====Radical strategies of visibility are part of sovereign violence. Their call for energizing debate relies on dated policies that replicate a multiplicity of strategies used by imperial powers in the status quo. The methodology should not energize debate but rather should render debate useless. Do not protect debate from its slow death, hasten it by voting negative.====&#xD;

====Our social position is that of debaters. We are all intimately affected by ballot libidinally.

=Whatever Being=&#xD;
&#xD;
Fullerton wants debate to be &amp;#34;inclusive&amp;#34; of the life experiences they have had.  The very idea that there is an inside is what creates an outside.  We should not assign particular grounds upon which are. In the case of debate, we should want to participate, but we should not base our inclusion/exclusion on whether or not we win a round on any given argument. &#xD;

what is right or wrong, what is included or what is excluded.&#xD;

As she reminds us it is crucial to recall that for centuries the pathological basis &#xD;

&#xD;
&#xD;
====Our alternative is &amp;#34;whatever being,&amp;#34; the singular being—an appreciation of forms of life without referent to an ends.   For the purposes of debate, this means that debaters should not judge their inclusion or exclusion based on whether or not they win or lose a round.   This removes the power of the sovereign; in this case the judge and the structure of debate as an activity. Instead of fighting for control of the debate apparatus, we advocate that teams should participate in the way that they would like without an appeal for inclusion.  Voting negative is not an act of exclusion or of assigning power to North Texas but rather a method to refuse failed categorization====&#xD;

====Further, the narratives themselves are never given full credit and truth. They are just a story, mere fantasy. The use of stories and narratives is descriptive of the link par excellence. Accepting the validity of all narratives equally creates a dull and homogenous multiculturalism and stifles anti-fascist political struggles – this means there never will be mobilization from the 1ac.====&#xD;

====Alt Solves====&#xD;

====There is no capacity for a permutation, we are the direct opposite of the aff. Do not save debate, walk away from it.

====Our ethico-political obligation is to refuse the debate apparatus that is invested in capitalist colonialism. We are obviously debating, but the question in this moment is how or what we are debating for or against. Capitalism render~’s its victims anonymous and ensures that the aff~’s personal focus never come to terms with the billions of degraded life choices globally—our epitstemological position as callous as it may be is a PREREQUISITE to understanding the full extent of accessibility concerns. ====&#xD;

===2NC – O/V===&#xD;
&#xD;
====They posit the starting point of their advocacy as one of evoking social and cultural change within a debate community, we start instead with a question of individuals in this space. 3 reasons this framing should be preferred:====&#xD;
&#xD;
====1 – It was their agency arguments – to submit to notions of collective identity is to cede all agency – this is the same logic of static gender categories that proscribe a certain biological sexual identity onto others.====&#xD;
&#xD;
====2 – Your ballot only has control over the discourses of this space, not a community writ large. Other debates prove that community transformation is long-term and only works in the local abstract – their framework superimposes the interests of the majority on individuals, which means that we control the direction to their impact.====&#xD;
&#xD;
====3 – External impact of alternative community backlash – communities don~’t exist in vacuums – rather, they exist in conjunction with other communities – to presuppose unique agency to our community is to impose superiority over others – this prevents an authentic encounter with Other communities, which superimposes violence and agency dissolution amongst others. Our alternative solves best because the attempt to find the Universal Community Identity is impossible – rather, this position begins and ends with the question of the individual.====&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
====Reliance on community is the source for racism and other exclusions====&#xD;
**Iris Marion Young, 1986,  Social Theory and Practice**&#xD;
&#xD;
Racism, ethnic chauvinism, and class devaluation, I suggest, grow partly from &#xD;
AND&#xD;
for example, or feminists from native American groups, and so on. &#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
===Role of the Ballot===&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
====We engage your role of the ballot argument in a couple of ways. ====&#xD;
&#xD;
A.	The counterplan calls into question your ability to meet the role of the ballot – the idea of &amp;#34;best performatively&amp;#34; implies a successful method of engaging affect in debate.  Our argument proves the starting point turns the aff. &#xD;
1.	Means no solvency&#xD;
2.	Means you recreate structures of oppression in debate. &#xD;
B.	Even if we don~’t go for the cp – the arguments on the counterplan are all reasons the affs performance is valuable but the method deployed is one that is in a location that obliterates difference and becomes commidfied. &#xD;
&#xD;
The symbolic construction of community requires  the elimination of difference—Moves toward assimilations are inherent in labels of community &#xD;
**Calderwood, ~’00 ~~ Patricia E. Calderwood, Assistant professor in the Department of Curriculum and Instruction at Fairfield University. &amp;#34;When Community Fails to Transform: Raveling and Unraveling a &amp;#34;Community of Writers&amp;#34;&amp;#34; The Urban Review, Vol. 32, No. 3, 2000~~ **&#xD;
Because individuals within community are not perfectly alike in every aspect of their beings, &#xD;
AND&#xD;
another within social groups and will be invented if they are not discovered.   &#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
===AT: CP Doesn~’t Tell Personal Experience===&#xD;
&#xD;
====First, our offense:====&#xD;
&#xD;
====1 – Their framework nullifies and turns the value of their narrative – the 1AC *analogizes* their personal experience and narrative to justify a universal Community narrative that would inevitably silence it. This appeal to the Community being in the background, nonetheless, is the very logic of individual agency submission they claim to reject.====&#xD;
&#xD;
====2 – Our framework is a better way of including individual narrative– narratives may be important, but the context in which they are deployed determine their political and micro-political potential – our advocacy provides a venue in which these don~’t become commodified by larger social structures.====&#xD;
&#xD;
====3 – We~’ve answered the better version of their argument – if their argument is &amp;#34;you should have told stories&amp;#34;, this is reductionists because:====&#xD;
&#xD;
====A – It~’s impossible to evaluate a debate based on quality of story.====&#xD;
&#xD;
====B – All argument is already enacted and performed always – our Arrigo evidence says the only question for the ballot is *how that performance relates to otherness* - theirs silences the question under a monolithic umbrella of Community, ours lets that voice come out under a foundation of individuality. ====&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
===AT: Perm===&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
====1. Textually severance, voting issue because a stable advocacy and position is the determining factor for all interrogation and all clash and all negative ground.  If we win any risk that discourse impacts reality, then this is not simply a whine because it~’s indistinguishable from severing an entire plank of the plan.====&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
====2. word choice is not a mere accident – it~’s a reflection of ideology====&#xD;
**Wenden, 2003 (Anita L., Professor Emerita of Research and Academic Writing and Professor Emerita of cultural Diversity at York College, &amp;#34;Achieving a Comprehensive Peace,&amp;#34; April, Peace and Change, Vol. 28, No. 2)**&#xD;
The reality we experience can be referred to in any number of different ways. &#xD;
AND&#xD;
, it is another linguistic means for communicating ideology through text or talk. &#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
====Perm is incoherent absent a resolution of the starting point question – if we win that starting at notions of individuality and rejecting notions of community is a better form of individual liberation, the perm would still include an inauthentic politic.====&#xD;
&#xD;
====Saying the word ~’perm~’ should be a reason they lose – it assumes that our notion of individuality can be colonized by a notion of Community – furthermore, this is intellectual violence that has occurred *in the debate space* and reason they lose independently.====&#xD;
&#xD;
====Three disads to the permutation:====&#xD;
&#xD;
====1 – Agency collusion – the perm leads to a mixture of community and invididual based politics without any clear distinction – this makes *grey-zones* inevitable – silences voices and our 1NC evidence proves this makes individual oppression inevitable.====&#xD;
&#xD;
====2 – Authenticism – to permute is to jettison one~’s initial world in hope of joining another perspective – this replicates colonialism and is a reason that the *method of a permutation* makes it collapse on itself.====&#xD;
&#xD;
====3 – Competition – to say &amp;#34;permutation&amp;#34; is to stipulate that arguments in a debate must compete. This notion of competition replicates an us-them dichotomy which makes violence and abject oppression inevitable. This guarantees Community norms never become visible because they function by *erasing difference*. ====&#xD;
&#xD;
====Our model would reject a notion of competition in favor of a notion of individual interactionalism – the role of the ballot is simply to determine which ballot allows for the most agency for individuals – the perm and their aff foreclose this.====&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
====Community seeks to eliminate difference by relying on a metaphysics of presence====&#xD;
**Iris Marion Young, 1986,  Social Theory and Practice**&#xD;
&#xD;
I criticize the notion of community on both philosophical and practical grounds. I argue &#xD;
AND&#xD;
the political question of the relations among face-to-face communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
====Metaphysics of presence eliminate potential openings for diversity and recreates transgender violence by upholding male/female binary. ====&#xD;
**Iris Marion Young, 1986,  Social Theory and Practice**&#xD;
&#xD;
The desire to bring things into unity generates a logic of hierarchical opposition. Any &#xD;
AND&#xD;
of thought and meaning, whose signification is never out of its grasp.&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
====Metaphyisics of presence deny difference====&#xD;
**Iris Marion Young, 1986,  Social Theory and Practice**&#xD;
&#xD;
Second, the metaphysics of presence represses or denies difference. This term has come &#xD;
AND&#xD;
logic of identity, withdraws from such particularity and constructs unreal essences. 3&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
===They have zero defense of debate community as the starting point===&#xD;
&#xD;
Only the cp solves. We lead to a change in what you recognize as a community:&#xD;
&#xD;
====A – Formation of micro-groups, such as judges/debaters in a room – these are the only communes we have control over, which is a solvency takeout to the 1AC and a reason only the CP results in change.====&#xD;
&#xD;
====B – These micro-groups spill over:====&#xD;
&#xD;
====1 – This is the function of how every debate impacts the social ====&#xD;
&#xD;
====2 – Individual experience changes how we relate to others discoursively outside of this setting – focus on setting as opposed to a community in which that setting is.====&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
====Language critique solves – challenging unconscious understandings of the world is key to changing political affect====&#xD;
Lakoff, UC Berkeley linguistics professor, co-founder and Senior Fellow of the Rockridge Institute, 2001&#xD;
(George, &amp;#34;The Mind and the World,&amp;#34; The FrameWorks Institute, http://www.frameworksinstitute.org/products/mind.pdf)&#xD;
The problem is a conceptual problem, a problem of mind. Our job is &#xD;
AND&#xD;
language to go with it, language that will effectively frame every issue. &#xD;

====Heideggerian being~’s relationship to death ignores colonial realities that force colonized to confront death daily. The search for authenticity goes hand in hand with colonial violence as it valorizes destruction of the non-entity marked upon colonial bodies.====&#xD;

====Their form of modernist politics privileges European culture at the center of world history subjecting the peripheral peoples to violence and genocides rendered inevitable and necessary in the name of civilization, rationality, science and philosophy.

====Our alternative is Epistemic Disobedience to modernity. Epistemic Disobedience is the only ethical response to modernity~’s hegemony on knowledge production. To be an ethical agent in a post-occidental world one must delink from modernity as a means of being outside hegemonic knowledge. ====&#xD;

====New epistemological approaches are key – without alternative approaches there is no way for most of the population to access our discussions or to create real world change. Only delinking from modernist thought balances empiricist analysis with localized forms of knowledge.====&#xD;
