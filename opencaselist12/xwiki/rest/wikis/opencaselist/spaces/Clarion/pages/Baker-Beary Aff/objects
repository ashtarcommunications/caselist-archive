Furthermore, for the sake of argument, even if nuclear proliferation does have stabilizing effects as optimists argue, as long as regional conflict among nuclear-armed states is possible, the basic argument presented here still holds. This is because power-projecting states may still feel compelled to intervene in the conflicts that do occur. These are conflicts that they perhaps could have avoided had nuclear weapons been absent.

Recommendations
 Part 810 should establish new procedures, including binding time lines, for the review and approval of requests for specific authorizations, including expedited procedures for deemed exports.
 A provision to expedite the approval of specific authorizations for deemed exports with a binding deadline should be included. Since foreign government assurances are not required for “deemed export” authorizations, approval of these specific authorizations are completely within the control of
the U.S. government. Establishment of a binding deadline for processing these requests is consistent with Section 57.b(2) of the AEA.
 To further expedite the specific authorization process for deemed exports and to reduce redundancies 
AND
industry’s behavioral observation program, which includes behavioral observation by peers and supervisors.

Stabilizing the current listing of nations and removing Russia, China, India, Kazakhstan, the Ukraine, and the UAE from the specific authorization list solves.

Despite the voluminous and complex nature of the DOC’s EAR, DOE’s Part 810 regulations are most often identified by U.S. exporters as the primary source of confusion, concern and delay. The Part 810 regulations, although concise, are based on vague statutory language that DOE’s Part 810 regulations do little to clarify.

Furthermore, for the sake of argument, even if nuclear proliferation does have stabilizing effects as optimists argue, as long as regional conflict among nuclear-armed states is possible, the basic argument presented here still holds. This is because power-projecting states may still feel compelled to intervene in the conflicts that do occur. These are conflicts that they perhaps could have avoided had nuclear weapons been absent.

Recommendations
 Part 810 should establish new procedures, including binding time lines, for the review and approval of requests for specific authorizations, including expedited procedures for deemed exports.
 A provision to expedite the approval of specific authorizations for deemed exports with a binding deadline should be included. Since foreign government assurances are not required for “deemed export” authorizations, approval of these specific authorizations are completely within the control of
the U.S. government. Establishment of a binding deadline for processing these requests is consistent with Section 57.b(2) of the AEA.
 To further expedite the specific authorization process for deemed exports and to reduce redundancies 
AND
industry’s behavioral observation program, which includes behavioral observation by peers and supervisors.

Stabilizing the current listing of nations and removing Russia, China, India, Kazakhstan, the Ukraine, and the UAE from the specific authorization list solves.

810 confusion key – advisory opinions and experience don’t solve

Despite the voluminous and complex nature of the DOC’s EAR, DOE’s Part 810 regulations are most often identified by U.S. exporters as the primary source of confusion, concern and delay. The Part 810 regulations, although concise, are based on vague statutory language that DOE’s Part 810 regulations do little to clarify. Consequently, U.S. companies – even those with considerable experience in exporting nuclear technology – often find the requirements of Part 810 confusing.
These broadly drafted regulations require U.S. persons to obtain an authorization from

regulations, other than advisory opinions that the agency provides to individual exporters.</headline></objectSummary><objectSummary><link rel="http://www.xwiki.org/rel/object" href="http://opencaselist.paperlessdebate.com/xwiki/rest/wikis/opencaselist/spaces/Clarion/pages/Baker-Beary%20Aff/objects/Admin.EntryClass/3"/><link rel="http://www.xwiki.org/rel/properties" href="http://opencaselist.paperlessdebate.com/xwiki/rest/wikis/opencaselist/spaces/Clarion/pages/Baker-Beary%20Aff/objects/Admin.EntryClass/3/properties"/><id>opencaselist:Clarion.Baker-Beary Aff:2c327239-3570-4598-a871-d372594cd411</id><guid>2c327239-3570-4598-a871-d372594cd411</guid><pageId>opencaselist:Clarion.Baker-Beary Aff</pageId><wiki>opencaselist</wiki><space>Clarion</space><pageName>Baker-Beary Aff</pageName><className>Admin.EntryClass</className><number>3</number><headline>___ The German economy is on the brink as exports are in decline.
