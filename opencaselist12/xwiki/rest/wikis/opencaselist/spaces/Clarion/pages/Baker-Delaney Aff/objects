Warming is real and anthropogenic.

Rahmstorf, Professor at the Postdam Institute for Climate Research, 08 (Stefan, &amp;#34;Anthropogenic Climate Change: Revisiting the Facts,&amp;#34; http://www.pik-http:www.pik/ potsdam.de/stefan/Publications/Book_chapters/Rahmstorf_Zedillo_2008.pdf)

This paper discussed the evidence for the anthropogenic increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration and the 
AND
anthropogenic global warming is a reality with which we need to deal. 

Transition to wind solves
Lago and Pullen 2012 (Carmen Lago, Ana Prades, Yolanda Lechón and Christian Oltra of CIEMAT, Spain; Angelika Pullen of GWEC, and Hans Auer of the Energy Economics Group, University of Vienna, May 2012, “Environmental Issues,” Wind Energy: The  Facts, http://www.wind-energy-the-facts.org/documents/download/Chapter5.pdf)
The energy supply is still dominated by fossil fuels, which contribute to the main environmental problems at the world level: climate change and air pollution. The use of renewable energies means lower green- house gas emissions and reduced air pollution, repre- senting a key solution to reach a sustainable future.
Wind is clean, free, indigenous and inexhaustible. Wind turbines do not need 
AND
by reducing the threat of climate change – the greatest threat to biodiversity.

Now is the key time for preventing runaway warming 

The Guardian 11-9-11 Fiona Harvey (environmental correspondent), World headed for irreversible climate change in five years, IEA warns, http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/nov/09/fossil-fuel-infrastructure-climate-change

The world is likely to build so many fossil-fuelled power stations, energy
AND
the carbon budget will be spoken for, according to the IEA&amp;#39;s calculations.

Warming causes extinction

Sify 2010 (Sify, Sydney newspaper citing Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, professor at University of Queensland and Director of the Global Change Institute, and John Bruno, associate professor of Marine Science at UNC (Sify News, “Could unbridled climate changes lead to human extinction?”, http://www.sify.com/news/could-unbridled-climate-changes-lead-to-human-extinction-news-international-kgtrOhdaahc.html)

The findings of the comprehensive report: &amp;#39;The impact of climate change on the world&amp;#39;s

Advantage 2: Copper
___ Production surplus of copper is dragging down prices

Business Line 1-14-13 India to benefit from copper surplus in 2013, http://www.steelguru.com/metals_news/India_to_benefit_from_copper_surplus_in_2013/298113.html

Copper production may outstrip demand in the 2013 calendar year by a margin equal to 
AND
up projects are anticipated to come on stream only in 2014 or later.
___ Wind increases the demand for copper – copper is a key material for wind power

Copper Development Association ’13 Wind Energy Basics, http://www.copper.org/environment/green/casestudies/wind_energy/wind_energy.html

How Copper Helps Make Wind Energy Possible¶ The primary use of copper in wind 
AND
more attention on renewable energy sources, copper will play an important role.

___ Copper prices set to fall as supply overwhelms demand – collapses the Chilean and Peruvian economies

Farchy 10-23-12
Jack, Financial Times, Copper bears predict impending surplus, http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/bba79a1e-1d29-11e2-869b-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2AjP8qnW2 

China’s slowing economy could spell the end of copper’s long price rise, combined as

___ This risks narco-terror

Endicott, member of the International Institute of Forecasters, 7-22-12 Jared Roy, The Evolution of Terror in Peru: Conquest, Communism, and Cocaine, http://jared.realizingresonance.com/2012/07/22/the-evolution-of-terror-in-peru-conquest-communism-and-cocaine

Terrorism in modern Peru has evolved from attacks by a collection of communist guerilla outfits 
AND
back to Peru I hope it will be for more than a vacation.

___ Key to WMD terror

Burns ’12 Robert (AP staffer) , Dempsey: Latin America ties key to terror war, 3-30-12, http://www.armytimes.com/news/2012/03/ap-latin-america-ties-key-to-terror-war-033012/

The rationale for building closer U.S. security ties in Latin America rests

This will escalate to mass extinction via global nuclear war 

Mohamed Sid-Ahmed, Al-Ahram Weekly political analyst, 2004 Al-Ahram Weekly, &amp;#34;Extinction!&amp;#34; 8/26, no. 705,  http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2004/705/op5.htm

What would be the consequences of a nuclear attack by terrorists? Even if it 
AND
When nuclear pollution infects the whole planet, we will all be losers.


Plan
Therefore the plan: The USFG should offer a taxable cash payment to wind project developers for the production of energy from wind

Observation : Tax Equity
___ The PTC was extended and expanded in the fiscal cliff legislation

Cudd and Jewett 1-9-13 Robert and Michelle, United States: American Taxpayer Relief Act Of 2012: Extends Production Tax Credit For Wind And Many Other Cleantech Tax Incentives, http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/215478/Corporate+Tax/American+Taxpayer+Relief+Act+Of+2012+Extends+Production+Tax+Credit+For+Wind+And+Many+Other+Cleantech+Tax+Incentives

On January 1, 2013, the Senate and the House of Representatives passed the 
AND
as construction on such projects has commenced prior to January 1, 2014.

___ However the PTC encourages tax equity investors to compensate for eligibility issues – this guts the value of the PTC in spurring deployment

Caperton, Director of Clean Energy Investments at the Center for American Progress, 12-14-12 Richard W., Small Tweaks To The Tax Code Can Mean Big Improvements In Renewable Energy Deployment, http://thinkprogress.org/tag/wind-energy/?mobile=nc

“How much is the production tax credit for wind worth?”  That sounds like 
AND
even though it still costs the taxpayers 2.2 cents per kwh.

___ This kills overall investment and jacks electricity costs – tax equity trades off with loans 

US PREF ‘11 US Partnership for Renewable Energy Finance, Tax Credits, Tax Equity and Alternatives To Spur Clean Energy Financing, http://uspref.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Tax-Credits-Tax-Equity-for-Clean-Energy-Financing.pdf

The most significant cost of tax equity, however, is that it makes obtaining 
AND
translate directly into higher cost of electricity. As the table below indicates,
this difference could be as much as $20/mwh.

___ Tax equity provisions kill real-world investment in wind – ensures transaction costs overwhelms developers
