The global expansion of capitalism to developing countries has rescued hundreds of millions of people

Capitalism incentives decreasing violence around the world and stopping dehumanization.

Pinker 2011 (Steven Professor of Psychology @ Harvard; two time Pulitzer finalist; The Better angels of our nature: why violence has declined; pp.682-4; kdf)

The idea that an exchange of benefits can turn zero-sum warfare into positive

Since the U.S. has been militarily engaged violence in all forms has fallen.

The fourth major transition took place after the e	nd of World War II

In the context of poststructuralist theory both the political subject and the social totality have

This structuring of capitalism ensures not only that they will not be able to solve, but the replication of all of the harms of capitalism.

Utopian ideologies invite genocide for two reasons. One is that they set up a

Violence is at an all-time low due to capitalist thought. Our claims are grounded in empiricism, their k is lodged in lofty intellectual thought.

Pinker 2011(Steven Professor of Psychology @ Harvard; two time Pulitzer finalist; The Better angels of our nature: why violence has declined; pp.xxi-xxiii; kdf)

This book is about what may be the most important thing that has ever happened

Reason gives access to the root cause of the K, as society naturally gets smarter otherization and violence decline.  

Pinker 2011 (Steven Prof of Psych @ Harvard; Decline of Violence: Taming the devil within us;  Nature 478, 309–311 (20 October 2011; kdf)

Zizek 2007 Slavoj, Resistance is Surrender, London Review of Books, 11/15 http://www.lrb.co.uk/v29/n22/zize01_.html

So what should, say, the US Democrats do? Stop competing for state

The negativity of the alternative cedes the world new worse forms of capitalism.

I think today the world is asking for a real … the marriage between capitalism and democracy is over.

Invisioning a world outside of capitalism fails because our desires are too strong to be inline with class interests

Steven, http://www.nettime.org/Lists-Archives/nettime-l-0410/msg00040.html, 10/24/04

There are various points, I admit, at which I am not entirely convinced

Zizek 2007 Slavoj, Resistance is Surrender, London Review of Books, 11/15 http://www.lrb.co.uk/v29/n22/zize01_.html

The response of some critics on the postmodern Left to this predicament is to call

Rejection of capitalism causes massive transition wars and fails

Harris 03, fellow at the Hoover Institution

This is the immiserization thesis of Marx. And it is central to revolutionary Marxism

the social order and all socialist schemes would be reduced to pipe dreams.

Government management of the environment is key. Individual action does nothing to solve the harms outlined in the 1ac

Luke in 97 (Timothy, EcoCritique, University of Minnesota Press, p. 126-7, kdf)
