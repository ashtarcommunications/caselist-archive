The natural gas industry is currently facing short

Such estimates are imprecise and may well be

domestic gas production can be exported as LNG.
However only an increase in pipeline development to capture Natural Gas excess can make exporting LNG and domestic use a reality.

America could now become a net exporter of

We believe, however, that LNG exports

The plan provides the necessary pipeline to move away from coal and oil, acting as a bridge towards renewables—this is the greatest internal link to warming

Today, natural gas is being found in

the word “green” is politically correct.


THUS THE PLAN
The United States Federal Government should clarify that natural gas pipeline projects will be evaluated on a case-by-case approach removing the bias toward incremental pricing. Incremental pricing will apply to projects that provide benefits only to new customers, projects that provide benefits for only existing customers will use rolled in pricing mechanisms, and projects that benefit both new and existing customers will be financed using a fair allocation of the costs based on cost-causation and benefits received.
Solvency
Next, Solvency- 
Current FERC policy sends mixed price signals deterring investment- the plan’s pricing rules can provide the incentives necessary for pipeline infrastructure expansion
