Nuke Power DA
Nuclear power is globally expanding and is catching on in the U.S.
WNA 11 (World Nuclear Association, The Nuclear Renaissance  , August 2011, http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf104.html-http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf104.html) JD
Since about 2001 there has been much talk about an imminent nuclear revival or &amp;#34;
AND
adversely changed the economics of nuclear power in places such as North America.

Nuclear power is critical to creating jobs here at home and to maintain our economy.
NAM 08 (National Association of Manufacturers, Expanding Nuclear Capacity Will Create High-Wage Jobs, Says NAM, Jun. 17, 2008, http://news.thomasnet.com/companystory/545823 )
The National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) said today that expanding America~’s nuclear capacity

The U.S. economy is key to the world economy.
Mead, Senior Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, 2004 (Walter Russell Mead, Foreign Policy, 4/1/04 pg. Lexis)

Similarly, in the last 60 years, as foreigners have acquired a greater value

One of the causes of World War I was the economic rivalry that existed between

**====The affirmative only makes energy production easier and thus cheaper, the logic of capitalism dictates that this only increases consumption resulting in extinction of the planet====**
**Foster et al 2010** (John Bellamy ~~prof of sociology @ U of Oregon~~, Brett Clark ~~Assistant prof of sociology @ NC State U~~ and Richard York ~~assoc. prof of sociology @ U of Oregon~~; Capitalism and the Curse of Energy Efficiency; Nov 1; http://monthlyreview.org/2010/11/01/capitalism-and-the-curse-of-energy-efficiency-http://monthlyreview.org/2010/11/01/capitalism-and-the-curse-of-energy-efficiency; kdf)

The Jevons Paradox was forgotten in the heyday of the age of petroleum during the

equality, human development, community, and sustainability are the explicit goals.


====Capitalism~’s naturalization of the process of subjugation creates social exclusion on a global scale – the ultimate ethico-political responsibility is to challenge the foundations of this system~’s organization principles. This makes reaching the Universal impossible.====

**Zizek and Daly 2004** (Slavoj and Glyn, Conversations with Zizek, 14-6)

For Zizek it is imperative that we cut through this Gord¬ian knot of 
AND
the principles of global liberal capitalism. This requires some care and subtlety.
For far too long, Marxism has been bedevilled by an almost fetishistic economism that 
AND
economism can end up reinforcing a de facto economic necessity in respect of contemporary 
This is not to endorse any kind of retrograde return to economism. Zizek~’s point 
AND
were simply a matter of chance and sound judgment in a neutral marketplace.
Capitalism does indeed create a space for a certain diversity, at least for the 
AND
political boutiquism that is readily sustained by postmodern forms of consumerism and lifestyle.
Against this Zizek argues for a new universalism whose primary ethical directive is to confront 
AND
the abject Other to that of a ~’glitch~’ in an otherwise sound matrix.


The Alternative is to withdraw from the ideology of capital. We are unsure of a blueprint for success, but our first action must be the refusal of our belief in capital. Only this can open up the space for authentic alternatives. 
Johnston 2k4, interdisciplinary research fellow in psychoanalysis at Emory University
(Adrian, Psychoanalysis, Culture %26 Society, December 9.3, p. 259, 2004)
Perhaps the absence of a detailed political roadmap in Zizek~’s recent writings isn~’t a major 
AND
comforting fiction (&amp;#34;Capitalist commodity fetishism or the truth? I choose fetishism&amp;#34;).~~
