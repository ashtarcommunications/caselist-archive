James Chadwick ‘discovered’ the neutron, &#xD;
I place that word, &#xD;
‘discovered,’&#xD;
In those nasty quotations because we no longer use such a word, &#xD;
James Chadwick embodied neutron, &#xD;
Most in my time that regularly boot the popular HBO Mediafile “Project Sherwood” recognize James Chadwick as the surly hardworking researcher with a propensity for miscalculations in ‘dating game.’&#xD;
Most of the docile spectators of my time accept the pop narrative that Chadwick is a veritable Prometheus, armed with the twin weapons of reason and rationality, by 2100 he will be understood as a hero, when, if one looks at the nucleus of the Chadwick story long enough, a decaying core reveals itself. &#xD;
My father… &#xD;
Yes I come from a BREEDER, officially my birth has been designated as **GRADE 2 NATURAL***, caused by an ***accidental recreational male-female intercourse event ***&#xD;
In my present, This birth grade is rare, &#xD;
My father’s predilection for ***NORM INTERCOURSE EVENTS*** will be one of those quirky nostalgic aspects of his personality, my father will be a historian, who will be relegated to The Wastes during the implementation of the Knowledge Purification Act of 2213. &#xD;
After the end of history, a historian loses their mainstream value, &#xD;
Those still producing history after the end of history are inefficient, and more importantly subject to suspicion, control, and abandonment. &#xD;
Before my father disappeared in the non-place of the waste site, he concealed his most important work. I have come from the not too distant future, with Proof that &#xD;
James Chadwick, &#xD;
Earth’s natural born American hero, was something much different than the accepted macho-mundane story found in HBO’s “Project Sherwood,” James Chadwick was not a NORM Category 1, no, James Chadwick was an atomic cyborg queerbot. Chadwick’s identity has been repurposed for a violent future that has distorted his dreams. As a representative of the International Liberation Army of Monster Queerbots I return to this crucial scene of lost history to reclaim the memory of James Chadwick.      &#xD;

James Chadwick emerged from his “neutron chamber” in 1921 fundamentally altered, &#xD;
Some said he immediately looked more childlike, some contended that he was only 19 when he first began using the “neutron chamber” for his famous “atomic experiments,” it is impossible to know his real age, just that he and his assistant Otto Hahn lived at least 197 more years, largely in secret from the then “American” public. &#xD;
By 1954 Chadwick was touring the country with the backing of “Project Sherwood” to promote a new effort to bring nuclear power out of the military industrial complex into the homes of the American people. Catching a glimpse of James Chadwick the manboy hero genius was more of a draw than Chadwick’s message of progress. Project Sherwood was an unprecedented campaign, selling the new nuclear society alongside a nostalgic and universal concept of the nuclear family.  &#xD;
Project Sherwood sold a large-scale domestic nuclear program by selling Chadwick’s Pristine Masculine Appeal. A personal tour of the Argonne National Laboratory with Chadwick was raffled off at each event. Adoring and screaming fans packed venues across the country for just a glimpse of him. Stories on record describe Chadwick as glowing. &#xD;

 In order to accomplish this goal society will be reformulated and fundamentally refashioned. The body and technology will “become one,” and those who receive the benefits of the coming society will live three generations after those who will make the sacrifices to build it. The coming society will enjoy a material abundance that will be unimaginable for those passing the nuclear plan today. &#xD;
&#xD;
James Chadwick however, will not be a public witness of this moment of nuclear accomplishment. James Chadwick virtually disappeared around 1980… &#xD;
From the diary of James Chadwick around 1970: &#xD;
Today I visited Doctor Enrico Fermi again. He is convinced that my “homosexual condition” is directly connected to a “toxic exposure” during the neutron experiments… He believes that I need slow neutron therapy. This would require me to go to France for three years. Dr. Fermi reminded me that I am not to speak to anyone about my “sexual condition” until after intensive therapy. &#xD;
It has become clear to me that Project Sherwood requires me to suppress my inner self when it comes to the public eye. It is my civic duty. &#xD;
I have not informed Otto about my visits to Dr. Fermi. I don’t know if I ever will. My love for him is not a “toxic condition.” If our success rate continues we can stay this way together, forever. &#xD;

The term horror autotoxicus …,&amp;#34; in Guattari&amp;#39;s memorable phrase. 19&#xD;
&#xD;
This post nuclear society will be a glowing epitome of the dreams of so many people of your time: &#xD;
The new Material abundance will reduce overall violence and resolve many political conflicts associated with scarcity, The world will join, old modernist political systems will fundamentally change.  &#xD;
The body and technology will “become one,”&#xD;
&#xD;
the infrastructure required to upgrade the grids lead to an entirely new transportation system, neutron based and fusion technologies leads to multiple advancements in biotechnology, neuroscience, and physics, new forms of jet propulsion based on repurposed nuclear fuel and lithium will open new terrains in space travel, which as everyone knows, leads to time continuum transport technologies. Everything will be different, but actually the same, just more ideal, eyesight becomes better, people live longer, much longer, age, simply put, is a disease in my time, death for us is no longer feared, death is now our obsession, and the fear of toxic contamination structures everything, and everyone,&#xD;
the types of technology that mesh with the body are impossible to calculate, in light of this, the sense of alienation is strong, the sense that one has become a machine is everywhere, those with the comfort of the oasis appeal to what is natural about themselves, to prove their purity: &#xD;
***&amp;#34;“I am a GRADE 1 NATURAL BORN, I REPRODUCE ACCORDING TO STAGE 2 HETERO NORM RULES AS PER THE ARTICLES OF NATURAL CITIZENSHIP, MY FAMILY AND I QUALIFY FOR A CLASS C MORTGAGE FOR OASIS SECTOR 3, which I am happy to say now has a LIGHT BLUE TOXICITY RATING”&amp;#34;****&#xD;
These are the things we say to ourselves and each other.&#xD;
 the “nuclear shift,” put in full swing during your time, is credited with changing it all. Life in the oasis is not all it is cracked up to be, perfection can be a burden.  &#xD;
In stark contrast to the oasis is the Wastes: the wastes are what will become of the “nuclear waste sites” where James Chadwick first went into hiding, as society advanced, the wastes grew, so did the numbers of people that would be relegated within its every expanding territory, &#xD;
In a society driven by the death taboo and in fear of toxic contamination it will become clear that only some are deemed worthy of the new abundance, the wastes become a place for many undesirables: radicals, the poor, minorities of all kinds, “deviants” of all kinds, criminals, saints, queers, the ugly, the lusty, the “mad” and the indefensible, barebackers and doms, and all manner of outlaws. Expulsion for the gated community becomes the commonplace method of justice. &#xD;

&#xD;
We in the International Liberation Army of Monster Queerbots do not despise our lot, we in fact have come to relish the freedom of the wastes and the marginality of our existence, our lives are harder, and we must consistently mobilize against threats from the center, we are not luddites, as those is the golden cities claim, we are liberated in this new society, however we must rectify a great harm being committed against our comrade’s spirit, James Chadwick’s spirit, which rightfully animates the entire body of the Monster Queerbots, we do not ask you to prevent this future or the path we are on, no, it is the only path that fate has laid out, we could not change our destiny if we tried, however we can reclaim his memory, &#xD;
James Chadwick was not a *** HETERO NORM Category 1***, he is not the symbol the symbol sold by Project Sherwood, he did not die in 1998. James Chadwick will be the original member of the Liberation Army of Monster Queerbots, James Chadwick was the hero of this nuclear age, and he is a queer of the highest order&#xD;

The only people allowed to participate in their movement would be those willing to check their identity at the door in order to become part of the universal movement against capitalism. This is exactly the way that James Chadwick’s identity as a gay man is seen in the 1AC. His identity literally becomes toxic to the “pure” “perfect” and “natural” nuclear society.

Orthodox Marxism seeks to label our movement as “merely cultural” and write off out identity, but only under the assumption that the ties between the material and cultural life are stable and objectively defined.  This will not unite the labor movement, but split it further as neo conservative Marxism further marginalizes those of fringe sexuality or race. The only reason Marxism is still relevant is because it has been opened up to particularities of oppression.

Erotic Energy 1AC 

Worshipping the handsomely glorious body of Jesus hung from the cross, gay men enter into an act of erotic intimacy. I kneel and bring my gaze upward. There, in front of me, inviting in his semi-naked vulnerability, his arms open wide to embrace me, is suspended my God. 

I lovingly scrutinize his broken body. I kiss his bloody and tired feet. I place my hand gently on his sweaty thighs, allowing my fingers to touch, ever so lightly, the soiled and grimy loincloth covering his wondrous genitals. I linger.
I have heard and read about ecstatic medieval nuns communing with his radiantly glorified foreskin. I wish I could experience a similar moment of erotic grace and revelation, perhaps by taking him whole into my open, inviting mouth. I sense the growing hardness. 
My hands travel up his firm, smooth chest, feeling his broken ribs and his leathery nipples as they come to life under the gentle pinch of my fingers. I place my head on his heart, my tears flowing down to his perfect navel. I lick them out with my tongue, tasting his delicately salty sweat. I rub and grope his thick arms, caressing them, and hear him moan in drunken pain.
 Moving slowly down to his punctured hands, I clean each finger in tum with my delirious tongue, sucking hungrily. I rub my cheek against his bearded face, transported by its rough and manly scrape. I tenderly kiss his fleshy ears, his burning mouth, his crusty eyes, his savagely lacerated forehead. He opens his eyes, a beatific smile of love playing on his gashed lips. He dies. My Lord, my All, my Savior. My sweet Jesus. Take me unto yourself. Make me one with you. 

The intersection between queer and religious identities is one of the ultimate examples of abjection. The queer experience is understood as sinful and polluting. This creates a relationship to queerness and queer bodies that attempts to control and stabilize it to prevent it from becoming to queer. Our affirmatives queering of our relationship with Jesus is one that bridges the gap between religious and queer culture that destabilizes the dominant cultural norms that allow for the exclusion of queer bodies. 
Donald Boisvert in 20006 writes … 

Pollution is invariably in … of queer redemption. 

Heteronormativity that is reinforced through strong religious ethos has necessitated both physical and psychological violence against queer bodies. This has lead queer bodies suppressing and closeting their identities while also re-enforcing institutionalized heterosexism. 
Dr Christine Loudes in 2003 writes … 

The experience of … to young LGB people. 

At Idaho State we walk around our campus and hear people speak not only negatively but also violently about queer bodies. We overhear conversations about how students love living in Idaho because they can get away with beating up the fags. However, these are not isolated events but are real events that happen at these very universities and these grounds that we stand on as we attend these debate tournaments. Diane Zosky in 2009 reveals accounts of these experiences which only serve to highlight how strong religious values influence this form of violence. Zosky explains …. 

In addition to … forever for it. 

Today at California State University, Fullerton we commune. It is interesting though. In some ways this community is a little bit religious. Even if not in the traditional sense, we defiantly produce and affirm certain sets up moral codes and norms. However, today I think that there is something different that I long for. 
Blood was not what I truly craved in the intimacy of my unspoken obsession. It was the divine seed, the most perfect sign of the most perfect communion from that most perfect of all male bodies, for which I ached. I wanted to ingest and retain it (this host), so that it could make me his now and forever.... 

Our affirmative is an affirmation of erotic energy. Our desire for an erotic relationship with Jesus is one that queers that relationship. We desire and long for the cum of Jesus. Eroticism shapes our understanding and determines our orientation towards the world and the people that we interact with. It creates a new relationship to ourselves and our body that affirms erotic desire. Marvin Ellison in 1996 writes … 

If it is misleading … beyond their control. ¶  

The ballot acts as an affirmation of eroticism to evaluate and participate in the rejection of oppression and sex negativity.  We will refuse to follow the logic inscribed by the heterosexist order and keep our sexualities in the closet; the pleasure we can feel when making love provides a sense of joy that extends far beyond the bedroom.  Our politics are essential to a sexual revolution that creates authentic connections with others. Audre Lorde in 81 writes … 


Beyond the superficial… same weary drama. 

We all come into these spaces with different social locations and experiences. Putting our bodies on the lines to create radical communities of openness while coming together around difference is necessary in order to challenge the dominant culture that cause injustice. 
  
Our coalitional politics is based on shared recognition of difference, and while that difference is not homogenized, it reformulates political organization against short term reformism and seeks a deeper, radical break. 
Dean in 03
The term “heteronormativity” … those promises and risks.

I went back and forth about it, I was afraid of what my family would say. Would my brother understand? Would my mom cry? Would my dad lash out? Would the students at school find out? Would they yell at me, spit at me, hit me, add me to the pile of beaten, bruised, and dead queer bodies? It wasn’t an easy decision. I vacillated. I was afraid. But I decided to sit my parents down and face their judgment, good or bad. I walked up to them and I said… well, it’s not important what I said. What is important is that they said they understood, and that they allowed me to fully embody and express the desires I had.
Now I come back to the same decision making point. Is it time for me to come out again to the debate community? Will you understand? Will you lash out? Try and get me to check my subjectivity at the door? Or will you provide compassion, and try to listen to me – the real me?
We are obviously closet(ed) policy hacks. And in order to begin our coming out party, we’ll being with the plan:

Wait. Not so fast. Before beginning our process of revealing, its important that we ensure this round, this community, provide a safe space for queer subjectivities. 

Coming out, or staying in – the entire closet is performative. The aff is a performance of the closet. Affirm the control of the closet – and coming out – it shouldn’t be a process determined violently by heteronormiativity.

The idea that …policy, and practice.




The impulse to engage the state with fidelity should be viewed with extreme queer skepticism – the state is unfamiliar to queer bodies outside of violence acted on the queer. The new knowledge produced through the affirmation of the closet is prior to the impulse for problem solutions – our aff is a policy corrective, not avoidance – our queering is the only way to avoid violence.

Drawing arbitrary lines about what kinds of argument should and should not count disciplines dissent.

The elimination of critique from policy debates creates the very climate of fear and ignorance that produces warfare.

When somebody lets me sneak a peek under their skirt, I don’t go tell everybody outside smoking about it, I keep the secret going, in the hopes that it will happen again, the anticipation makes me nearly pop, it’s not my responsibility to out people, each of us must navigate the conflict between the self-subjugating violence of checking one’s subjectivity at the door and the violence of society’s categories of subhuman, sometimes this negotiation with the closet door is so overwhelmingly catastrophic but other times it is just what one craves, a subdued excited erotic energy waiting just beneath the surface, waiting to be fracked out, hot, starting with the ankles, powered with a full head of steam, across the starved and drought-ridden valley of your thighs, fuck! this death valley, fuck! thirst, FUCK!, I stand erect ready to provide the moisture, this bottle has no label, but don’t worry the perspiration on its cover should reassure you that it comes from my chilly little cooler, just drink it before you die!, put it in your mouth!, and then let me have it, we are in the desert and there is nobody for miles,

There is no way for me to fully come out here. All categories fall short: lesbian, gay, straight, bisexual, policy, critical, whatever. Very few of us ever fully come out of the closet, who of us make the keyholes to all of our erotic desires part of our public persona?, the official record of our “sexual preference.”    


Coming out, or staying in – the entire closet is performative. The aff is a performance of the closet. Affirm the control of the closet – and coming out – it shouldn’t be a process determined violently by heteronormativity. The move to expose externally is violence towards queer bodies.

An empty space, a nowhere place, dusted with snow, stagnant, backwards, and 20 years behind the rest of the country.  But who notices anyway? SPRING BREAK! As long as there’s thai food, what’s the difference: It’s all just hotel rooms, stairwells, electronic-cigarettes, and computer screens, right? Such an ideal non-environment for the ideal speech communication, an abstraction divorced from place and time. What is time? What is the present, and what makes it not the past? The past remains stubbornly with us, but always constrained and conditioned by place; time rushes like the Snake River at the peak of its spring orgasm, these banks are gonna burst, and nowhere in Pocatello is safe! Beyond the map and beyond the grid,  
(in prep time you should Wikipedia the Yellowstone Caldera) : Time is impossible, good thing we’ve got the SQUO to solve that for us! Time intersects with this place at a colonial, sexual, and geological level. Before this place had any relation to the city, white humans came over the Wasatch Mountains and said of the Salt Lake Valley: “It is enough. This is the right place. Drive on.”  An “untouched” virgin landscape for a celestial community and masturbatory preparations for the apocalypse, a few of those came up north, a long journey that is now about a 2 hour van ride , along the way these humans encountered some natives, the Shoshone and others were already well acquainted with two-spirit people , but the cattle herders and soldiers snuck into the darkness of the scrub oak to exchange erotic male pleasantries, complicating their eternal salvations, they were well trained in the portable skills of the day, decision-making of policymakers, and were well-backed by federals; they knew what to do, and on a single day in the Seuhubeogoi, hundreds were converted with blood , when they reached to the Portneuf Valley, and met Chief Pocatello, all of this was already rural space. The ranchers cattle ate all the grasses, ever since the grass has been hard to find, the landscape was carefully dissected into agricultural plots, trade, churches, brick ovens, wells and roads, surveyors would soon be in search of coal, the Portneuf would fill with condoms and garbage, far too many gentlemen were sneaking off in the middle of the night with other gentlemen, something had to be done, meaning of rural America was hotly contested

Thinking violence as … fifty wounds signify?

Many debates engage in a training model that assume an abstract disconnected and neutral discussion which abdicates individual ethical responsibility and ignores the context of real-life political decision-making. This view refuses to consider the way participation in community implicates all of member to consider the violence on its periphery. This is an empirically failed frame that perpetuates the social order for those who benefit from it.

I kneel and bring my gaze upward. There, in front of me, inviting in his semi-naked vulnerability, his arms open wide to embrace me, is suspended my God. &#xD;
&#xD;
I lovingly scrutinize his broken body. I kiss his bloody and tired feet. I place my hand gently on his sweaty thighs, allowing my fingers to touch, ever so lightly, the soiled and grimy loincloth covering his wondrous genitals. I linger.&#xD;
I have heard and read about ecstatic medieval nuns communing with his radiantly glorified foreskin. I wish I could experience a similar moment of erotic grace and revelation, perhaps by taking him whole into my open, inviting mouth. I sense the growing hardness.&#xD;
My hands travel up his firm, smooth chest, feeling his broken ribs and his leathery nipples as they come to life under the gentle pinch of my fingers. I place my head on his heart, my tears flowing down to his perfect navel. I lick them out with my tongue, tasting his delicately salty sweat. I rub and grope his thick arms, caressing them, and hear him moan in drunken pain.&#xD;
 Moving slowly down to his punctured hands, I clean each finger in tum with my delirious tongue, sucking hungrily. I rub my cheek against his bearded face, transported by its rough and manly scrape. I tenderly kiss his fleshy ears, his burning mouth, his crusty eyes, his savagely lacerated forehead. He opens his eyes, a beatific smile of love playing on his gashed lips. He dies. My Lord, my All, my Savior. My sweet Jesus. Take me unto yourself. Make me one with you. &#xD;
&#xD;
The intersection between queer and religious identities is one of the ultimate examples of abjection. The queer experience is understood as sinful and polluting. This creates a relationship to queerness and queer bodies that attempts to control and stabilize it to prevent it from becoming to queer. Our affirmatives queering of our relationship with Jesus is one that bridges the gap between religious and queer culture that destabilizes the dominant cultural norms that allow for the exclusion of queer bodies.&#xD;
Donald Boisvert in 20006 writes … &#xD;
&#xD;
Pollution is invariably in … of queer redemption. &#xD;
&#xD;
Heteronormativity that is reinforced through strong religious ethos has necessitated both physical and psychological violence against queer bodies. This has lead queer bodies suppressing and closeting their identities while also re-enforcing institutionalized heterosexism.&#xD;

At Idaho State we walk around our campus and hear people speak not only negatively but also violently about queer bodies. We overhear conversations about how students love living in Idaho because they can get away with beating up the fags. However, these are not isolated events but are real events that happen at these very universities and these grounds that we stand on as we attend these debate tournaments. Diane Zosky in 2009 reveals accounts of these experiences which only serve to highlight how strong religious values influence this form of violence. Zosky explains …. &#xD;

&#xD;
Today at the NDT we commune. It is interesting though. In some ways this community is a little bit religious. Even if not in the traditional sense, we defiantly produce and affirm certain sets up moral codes and norms. However, today I think that there is something different that I long for.&#xD;
Blood was not what I truly craved in the intimacy of my unspoken obsession. It was the divine seed, the most perfect sign of the most perfect communion from that most perfect of all male bodies, for which I ached. I wanted to ingest and retain it (this host), so that it could make me his now and forever.... &#xD;
&#xD;
Our affirmative is an affirmation of erotic energy. Our desire for an erotic relationship with Jesus is one that queers that relationship. We desire and long for the cum of Jesus. Eroticism shapes our understanding and determines our orientation towards the world and the people that we interact with. It creates a new relationship to ourselves and our body that affirms erotic desire. Marvin Ellison in 1996 writes … &#xD;
&#xD;
If it is misleading … beyond their control. ¶  &#xD;
&#xD;
The ballot acts as an affirmation of eroticism to evaluate and participate in the rejection of oppression and sex negativity.  We will refuse to follow the logic inscribed by the heterosexist order and keep our sexualities in the closet; the pleasure we can feel when making love provides a sense of joy that extends far beyond the bedroom.  Our politics are essential to a sexual revolution that creates authentic connections with others. Audre Lorde in 81 writes … &#xD;
&#xD;
Beyond the superficial… same weary drama. &#xD;
&#xD;
We all come into these spaces with different social locations and experiences. Putting our bodies on the lines to create radical communities of openness while coming together around difference is necessary in order to challenge the dominant culture that cause injustice.&#xD;
 &#xD;
Our coalitional politics is based on shared recognition of difference, and while that difference is not homogenized, it reformulates political organization against short term reformism and seeks a deeper, radical break.&#xD;
