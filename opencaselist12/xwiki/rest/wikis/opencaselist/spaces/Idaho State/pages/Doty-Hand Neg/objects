It forces us into a normative construction of politics that privileges the white body by foreclosing the possibility of pedagogies that teach us how to engage a variety of different perspectives. Forcing a default framing of utilitarianism via threats of extinction and the invocation of “aff choice” puts women and minorities at an automatic competitive disadvantage.

There is something not… in all its forms.

The debate community is fractured; this is what makes it beautiful. Founding community based on a linguistic commonality destroys difference, their framework requires homogeneity and the destruction of all perspectives that are deemed outside of it

Secomb 2000 (Linnell, a lecturer in Gender Studies at the University of Sydney, “Fractured Community,” Hypatia, Vol 15, No 2, Spring 2000, pp 138-139)

This reformulated universalist… homogeneity and transparency.

Your pro-USFG framework drivel drives faith-based politics.  Not in a religious sense, but because they lead to placing blind faith in political leaders.  Faith-based politics apply the logic of preemption to civil society, acting to section off and contain potential dissent, a la the “free speech cages” at the DNC.

The problem arises around… alienation we live in.2

Postmodernism robs us of our only effective resistance by dubiously linking all totality/coherence/history with atrocity.
Zerzan 97

So I started having… that’s really well put.

Civilization is alienating – it forces a false disconnect from nature and locks us into a death spiral. Half the planet is starving, the other half suffers from diseases of affluence, the biosphere is shot, and extinction is inevitable. Life and Liberty require the dissolution of civilization.

Zerzan 98 (John, “Agriculture: Demon Engine of Civilization” http://imperium.lenin.ru/~kaledin/tmp/agricltr.txt)
 Food has been one… impossible without its dissolution.

The dominant historical narrative has taught us that civilization is the natural outcome of humanity—this is far from the truth and is ultimately a crazy rationalization for a system that has been imposed upon us via coercion and will ultimately result in planetary extinction
Watson 1991 (David, “Civilization in Bulk”, Fifth Estate, Summer)
According to official history… that will be left?

Policies like the affirmative directly tradeoff with the alt

It isn&amp;#39;t that there&amp;#39;s… its extremely limited horizons.

Cultural analysis always brackets off the necessary critique of civilization itself—all we get stuck with is the cynicism of masturbatory postmodern politics
Zerzan 2005 (John, Primitivist Activist, MA SFSU, http://insurgentdesire.org.uk/culture.htm)
Culture was more respected… lieu of unmediated life.

We must get beyond the symbolic violence of language and discourse to eradicate domestication

Layla Abdel-Rahim, 2008 (Beyond the Symbolic and towards the Collapse: Intro to John Zerzan’s conferences in Montreal, May 2008. http://layla.miltsov.org/introduction-to-z/)
John Zerzan’s existence as a… its abstract, unreal logic.

Postmodernism sucks because by placing everything into the discursive field, we can (ir)rationalize away environmental destruction as a social construct rather than immediate consequences of our embrace of civilization
 
Zerzan in 2005 (John, http://insurgentdesire.org.uk/globalization.htm)
In fact, even more confounding… the endangered coherent individual.


Our alternative: vote negative.

We must refuse the blueprints and the traps of civilized logic in the movement model and its attendant hierarchy – instead we must realize chaos rules everything, trying to force order is counterproductive and authoritarian. 
The appropriate question is whether or not we contribute to or detract from the momentum against civilization?
