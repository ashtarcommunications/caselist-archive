=== We welcome Nuclia Waste to center stage. Her power goes beyond human comprehension. Not because we cannot fathom it, but rather because we choose to exclude it. How silly does it seem that such a quaint town, such as Rocky Flats, could produce such a monstrosity? ===

=== Heteronormativity has constructed the city as the place where the unnatural and sinful acts of homosexual activity flourish. However, even in the rural town of Rocky Flats can create a monstrosity like Nuclia. ===

=== Our current relationship to Ecology Privileges the “natural”, which creates a binary that normalizes heterosexism and justifies the denigration of queer sexualities as deviant. This is the same for areas that are rural, such as Rocky Flats, the queer is erased in the name of masculinity and heteronormativity. ===

(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&amp;#34; %)Here, I would like to turn our attention away from ecology as a science and toward environmentalism as a politics of natural space, in which sexuality has also had interesting influences. Indeed, (%%)__the (% style=&amp;#34;background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)sexual values enacted in struggles over space have had(%%) at least (% style=&amp;#34;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)as strong an influence on environmentalism as those enmeshed in the science of ecology(%%)__(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&amp;#34; %). Although there are many stories I could tell, what I would like to talk about, briefly, is the fact I mentioned in my discussion of national parks at the beginning of the paper. To reiterate: (% style=&amp;#34;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)__In its early incarnation, North American environmentalism emerged as a response to the rise of industrial cities__(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&amp;#34; %). As I have argued, (% style=&amp;#34;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)__wilderness and rural spaces came to be valued as sites to be preserved “away” from the corrupting influences of urban industrial modernity__(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt&amp;#34; %). (% style=&amp;#34;font-size:8.0pt&amp;#34; %)In addition, __the cultivation of “natural” spaces inside cities__, including urban parks such as Central Park in New York, __was conceived as a way to bring health and morality to the city’s inhabitants. __(% style=&amp;#34;background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow&amp;#34; %)__Nature was__(%%)__, here, (% style=&amp;#34;background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow&amp;#34; %)a space of intensive moral regulation(%%); (% style=&amp;#34;font-size:8.0pt&amp;#34; %)given the increasing association of sexuality with ideas of nature,(%%) (% style=&amp;#34;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)sex became a key element in the organization of nature(%%) (% style=&amp;#34;font-size:8.0pt&amp;#34; %)as a regulatory space.(%%)__(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:8.0pt&amp;#34; %) The __early parks movement was, as I mentioned, born partly from a desire to facilitate recreational practices that would restore threatened masculine virtues.__ Of course, __this desire was also planted in the assumption that cities were sites of the particular moral “degeneracy” associated with homosexuality__. In part as a result of the idea that homosexuality was a sort of illness, medical thinkers of the late nineteenth century came to believe that the environmental conditions of large urban centers actually cultivated homosexuality.(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&amp;#34; %) (% style=&amp;#34;background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)__There were various explanations offered for this supposed urban moral degeneration: the idea that the work men did in cities no longer brought them into close and honorable contact with nature__(%%)__; (% style=&amp;#34;font-size:8.0pt&amp;#34; %)the racist belief that homosexuality was associated with “immigrant” populations; and the growing idea that homosexuality might have environmental causes(%%)__(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:8.0pt&amp;#34; %). To quote Boag, “pollution, tainted foods, and even the fastpaced nature of urban life,” in the minds of some Victorian physicians, “induced” homosexuality. 15 In response,(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&amp;#34; %) (% style=&amp;#34;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)__the creation of remote recreational wild spaces and the demarcation of “healthy” green spaces inside cities, was understood partly as a therapeutic antidote to the social ravages of effeminate homosexuality.__(%%)__ (% style=&amp;#34;font-size:8.0pt&amp;#34; %)The joint construction of sex and nature is quite complex; although I will not get into it here, it is also strongly tied to modern ideas of nationalism in both the United States and Canada.(%%)__(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:8.0pt&amp;#34; %) There are, however, two sets of ideas I would like to pull out. First, (% style=&amp;#34;font-size: 8pt; background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow&amp;#34; %)__there__(% style=&amp;#34;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)__ is the assumption that homosexuality is a product of the urban, and that rural and wilderness spaces are thus somehow “free” from the “taint” of homoerotic activity__(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&amp;#34; %). (% style=&amp;#34;font-size:8.0pt&amp;#34; %)Nothing, in fact, could be further from the truth. At the end of the nineteenth century and well into the twentieth, the western wilderness was a space heavily dominated by communities of men. These men – prospectors, cowboys, ranchers, foresters -like British sailors at sea for more than six months, frequently engaged in homosexual activity. Indeed, if sexologist Alfred Kinsey’s research was correct, there was in the nineteenth century actually more same-sex activity in the remote wilderness than there was in the cities. As I suggested earlier, such men were not understood as “homosexuals.” To quote Kinsey, “these are men who have faced the rigors of nature in the wild…. Such a background breeds the attitude that sex is sex, irrespective of the nature of the partner with whom the relation is had.” 16 __It was not until homosexuality became coded as an inherent and biologically-based identity that it came to be understood as an illness and located in the “artificiality” of cities. Certainly, cities made it easier for interested men to find anonymous homoerotic contacts. Also, port cities such as New York and San Francisco eventually became very important places for homosexual men to carve out spaces for their fledgling sexual communities. But it was the growing visibility of these communities, and the increasing association of homosexuality with artificiality, that tied the homosexual to the urban, not some actually greater homoerotic presence. Simply put,__(%%)__ (% style=&amp;#34;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)it was not until the homosexual became urban that he became “unnatural(%%)”(% style=&amp;#34;font-size: 8.0pt&amp;#34; %); emerging environmental critiques of the artificiality of cities were thus instrumental in shaping ideas about the artificiality of queers. The linkage of homosexuality and cities, here, was clearly a product of ideology, but that ideology has had an enormous material impact on both queers and natural spaces. The pervasive assumption that queer communities are essentially urban has had the effect of erasing the ongoing presence of rural gay men and lesbians(%%)__(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:8.0pt&amp;#34; %) whose lives might not look much like Christopher Street. __This erasure has contributed to the flight of rural queers from their homes to find “true” community in cities, to the ghettoization of queer culture, and to the widespread assumption that country spaces are inherently hostile to queer folk__. Although one must not ever forget Brandon Teena and Mathew Shepard, it is abundantly clear that urban spaces are often far more dangerous for us than rural ones. __In addition, these spatial processes have also affected the spaces of nature. On the one end of the spectrum, we see the physical concentration of gay men and lesbians in particular urban neighborhoods; their distinct and diverse patterns of community organize urban nature in particular ways. Less well known, however, is the fact that heterosexism in rural landscapes has physically shaped what rural nature looks like. __Recreational and rural natures are materials marked with heterosexism. In the former category, __such spaces as national parks clearly bear the developmental imprints of specific gendered and sexualized ideas of nature. For one small example, think about public campgrounds. Particularly after the 1950s, many camping facilities were intentionally designed to resemble suburban cul-de-sacs, each campsite clearly designed for one nuclear family, and all camping occurring in designated “private” spaces away from “public” recreational activities such as swimming, hiking, and climbing. Trees were cut down in a pattern that screened campsites from one another, but not from the roadway or path, so that the rangers or wardens could still see in and make sure nothing illegal (such as sodomy) was taking place.__ For a second and earlier example, __consider the settlement of much of the state of Oregon. In the mid-nineteenth century, the Donation Land Act (DLA) encouraged a heterosexual pattern of colonization because of the way land was allotted to settlers.__ “A white male who was twenty-one or older … received a 160-acre parcel and an additional 160 acres for his wife.&amp;#34; 17 Women were not eligible for allotments as single people, and it was clearly in the advantage of men to have the two parcels, so “very young girls suddenly became marriageable and were soon wives.” 18 __Because of the comparatively large size of these allotments and the popularity of the program, not only did the DLA encourage heterosexual marriage along with the settlement of the west, but it imposed a monolithic culture of single heterosexual family-sized lots on the land, with significant effects on the economic and environmental history of the region from nuclear family farming patterns, the inhibition of town development, and even increased forestation. __(% style=&amp;#34;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)__As a result of the association of degenerate queers with cities, and rural and wilderness landscapes with wholesome, heterosexual family life, there developed in the nineteenth century the idea that nature is a primary place in which to develop moral and physical fitness__(%%)__. (% style=&amp;#34;font-size:8.0pt&amp;#34; %)With the hetero-masculine deployment of wilderness at the turn of the century – which, incidentally, also saw the rise of organizations like the Boy Scouts – we can see the antecedents of how nature was deployed during the Great Depression and into World War II as a site for the cultivation of a rigidly disciplinary heteromale ideal(%%)__(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:8.0pt&amp;#34; %).In the United States, for example, organizations such as the Civilian Conservation Corps provided unemployed young men with physically and morally healthy work in the wilderness. At apparent risk of degeneracy in cities, such men were located in camps far from urban centers and, between 1933 and 1942, strenuously “installed 89,000 miles of telephone line, built 126,000 miles of roads and trails, constructed millions of erosion control dams, planted 1.3 billion trees, erected 3,470 water towers, and spent over 6 million hours fighting forest fires.” 19 __All of these developments are markers of a national desire for a particular kind of man as much as they are about the infrastructural needs of particular landscapes.__

(% class=&amp;#34;underline&amp;#34; style=&amp;#34;font-size:8.0pt&amp;#34; %)The most important critique of expanded conceptions of security, of which environmental considerations are part, concerns the possibility of olonizatio responses(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:8.0pt&amp;#34; %). (% class=&amp;#34;underline&amp;#34; %)Because the prevailing approach to security is still ‘mired in ideological straitjackets’, and carries with it an array of sentiments a narrow problem-solving mindset, its utility for comprehending responding to non-military issues is questionable(%%) (Dalby 91 29). When examining discourses of ‘the war on drugs’, ‘water wars’, Third World turbulence and so on, it becomes increasingly apparent that this post-Cold War security agenda is still basically the same realist agenda that prevailed throughout the Cold War, although now exhibiting previously secondary concerns brought forth in the sudden absence of the olonizati West—East threat. Campbell argues that(%%) (% class=&amp;#34;underline&amp;#34; style=&amp;#34;background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)the Western response to the current era of world politics is ‘characterised by the representation of novel challenges in terms of traditional analytics, and the varied attempts to replace one enemy with (an)other’(%%) (% style=&amp;#34;font-size:8.0pt&amp;#34; %)(Campbell 1992: 8). This is borne out in the 1998 US National Security Strategy which states that(%%) (% class=&amp;#34;underline&amp;#34; %)‘(% style=&amp;#34;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)the current international security environment presents a diverse set of threats to our enduring goals and hence to our security’, including transnational threats such as ‘terrorism, international crime, drug trafficking, illicit arms trafficking, uncontrolled refugee migrations and environmental damage’ which ‘threaten US interests,(%%) (% style=&amp;#34;font-size:8.0pt&amp;#34; %)citizens and the US homeland itself(% style=&amp;#34;font-size:8.0pt&amp;#34; %) (Clinton 1998: 10). (% class=&amp;#34;underline&amp;#34; %)A key part of the US response is to ‘maintain superior military forces at the level of readiness necessary to effectively deter aggression, conduct a wide range of peacetime activities and smaller-scale contingencies, and, preferably in concert with regional friends and allies, win two overlapping major theater wars’(%%) (Clinton 1998: 11). This holds true for environmental security as well, as Smil argues:(%%) (% class=&amp;#34;underline&amp;#34; style=&amp;#34;background: yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)In thinking about the new horse of environmental degradation(%%), (% style=&amp;#34;font-size:8.0pt&amp;#34; %)it is really the old gibbon’s heart of national security that many of the new(%%) (% class=&amp;#34;underline&amp;#34; style=&amp;#34;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)securitarians(%%) (% style=&amp;#34;font-size:8.0pt&amp;#34; %)want to preserve. They(%%) (% class=&amp;#34;underline&amp;#34; style=&amp;#34;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)alter, dilute, and extend the meaning of security beyond any classical recognition, but they never give up on its original idea which embodies conflict and violence(% style=&amp;#34;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %). This is because the idea carries them to the heart of existential anguish and moral peril, fear(%%)s (% style=&amp;#34;font-size:8.0pt&amp;#34; %)without which their message would not merit such an anxious hearing by politicians, the military, or the mass media. (Smil 1997: 108) (% class=&amp;#34;underline&amp;#34; %)Thus(% class=&amp;#34;underline&amp;#34; %) (% style=&amp;#34;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)the hidden goal of security — that of maintaining power within the state(%%) — (% style=&amp;#34;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)remains unchallenged so long as security is projected as an absolute imperative(%%). In short, (% class=&amp;#34;underline&amp;#34; style=&amp;#34;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)the effect of broadening national security to include social, political and environmental issues(% class=&amp;#34;underline&amp;#34; %) (% style=&amp;#34;font-size:8.0pt&amp;#34; %)— without changing the nation- state as the referent(%%) (% style=&amp;#34;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow&amp;#34; %)— is the further colonization of domestic society by realism’s ultimately violent logic.(%%) (% style=&amp;#34;font-size:8.0pt&amp;#34; %)For as long as security remains tied up in the state-centric realist paradigm, introducing new issues will be conceptually counterintuitive and practically counterproductive to these issues, and to the broader goal of justice(% style=&amp;#34;font-size: 8.0pt&amp;#34; %). In most of the accounts discussed in this chapter, the logical confines of conventional security reasoning are not broken, and the state remains the site of politics. So, adding new issues to the agenda of security studies does not necessarily equate to a modification of the conceptual base, and may lead to a bolstering of the state-centered approach (Shaw 1993). (% class=&amp;#34;underline&amp;#34; %)Expanding the security agenda without seriously contesting the meaning of security perpetuates the failure of the security concept to take into account the needs of people. In this broader (but not deeper) agenda, security is still the preserve of states acting in their own interests — interests which for the most part do not correspond to the needs of people.
