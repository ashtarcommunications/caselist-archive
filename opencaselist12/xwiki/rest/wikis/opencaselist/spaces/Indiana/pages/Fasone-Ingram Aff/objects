===Scenario One is the Renewable Race===

XXX Economy low now, Jobs, Manufacturing, Industry XXX

====We~’re losing the renewable race====
Mormann ~’11 (Felix, prof at Steyer-Taylor Center for Energy Policy and Finance, Stanford Law School, &amp;#34;Requirements for a Renewables Revolution,&amp;#34; 38 Ecology L.Q. 903)
The task of a timely transition to renewables is one of Herculean dimensions. The 
AND
far-reaching that they may well be described as a renewables revolution.

====Other nations are locking in their positions, a FIT solves====
Toby D. **Couture et al 2010**, E3 Analytics, Karlynn Cory, Claire Kreycik, National Renewable Energy Laboratory,  Emily Williams, U.S. Department of State, July **2010** Technical Report, National Renewable Energy Laboratory,  work was funded by the DOE, &amp;#34;A Policymaker~’s Guide to Feed-in Tariff Policy Design,&amp;#34; 
With their increasing worldwide adoption, feed-in tariffs are poised to play an important role in advancing the deployment of renewable energy technologies. Many early adopters of FIT policies have had success propelling their renewable energy (RE) sectors (measured in manufacturing capacity, job creation, etc.) and in rapidly expanding the share of RE in their overall electricity mix. In particular, the policy framework created by FIT policies has enabled
certain countries such as Germany and Denmark to become incubators of RE technology and innovation, and create export opportunities in RE markets around the world. Combined with a long-term commitment to a renewable energy future, these countries have begun to lock in their strategic position in the energy economy of the 21st century. New sectors and technologies are
beginning to emerge, which provides other jurisdictions with the opportunity to develop similar competitive advantages as the global marketplace for renewable energy technologies expands and evolves. Through an overview of different policy practices found around the world, this report provides a comprehensive overview of FIT policy options, while highlighting a few key elements of policy
success. These include:
• long-term policy stability;
• payments based on the costs of RE generation; • differentiating the tariff prices 
AND
through increased RE deployment, fewer environmental impacts, and increased job creation.
The benefits for project financing and RE investment are particularly worth noting: First, RE developers benefit from the long-term stability of the revenue streams generated from electricity sales, which helps foster a high level of investment security. Well-designed feed-in tariffs can help reduce risk, which can also help reduce the overall costs of RE development for society.
The stability of the framework makes it more likely for traditionally risk-averse investors 
AND
both the location and the quantity of new RE manufacturing (Diekman 2008).
European Union (EU) experience suggests that the stability and longevity of the policy 
AND
spur further innovation and technological cost reduction (Diekman 2008, Hvelplund 2005).

**====Delay would lock the US out of the market====**

The estimated range of net economic benefits to the United States in 2020 is %24
AND
decrease in global petroleum demand. Sources of Benefits Benefits from Clean Energy Markets
Both U.S. producers and consumers stand to benefit from significant global shifts toward clean energy technologies. The first impact comes through an increase in the export of CET products by U.S. producers.
However, U.S. CET producers will benefit from increased sales overseas only 
AND
global market sector can develop significant and permanent cost advantages over later entrants.
Consumers can benefit from enhanced efforts in CET markets through lower CET prices. The 
AND
the range of benefit estimates accounts for the possibility that prices might increase.

====A domestic market is key====

===Scenario Two Distributed Energy===

====Status quo policies maintain momentum for large power stations====
John **Farrell**, ILSR senior researcher specializing in energy policy developments that best expand the benefits of local ownership and dispersed generation of renewable energy, Jun 23, **2011** &amp;#34;Democratizing the Electricity System – A Vision for the 21st Century Grid&amp;#34; http://www.ilsr.org/energy/publications/democratizing-electricity-system-vision-21st-century-grid/
While technology advances and costs drop, the major obstacle confronting distributed generation is a century of rules and institutional structures predicated on the outdated assumption that power plants will continually grow in size and electricity will continue to be transmitted over ever-longer distances.  From federal energy incentives to rules issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to state interconnection rules, there is a systemic bias toward centralized power and one-way grid systems.
Expanding and adopting new policies can level the playing field.

====FIT is needed to for small wind and solar generators====

U.S. programs allow participation by owners of residential PV arrays.

====FIT produces a market for decentralized electricity production====
Behles ~’12 (Deborah, law prof and clinical attorney at Golden Gate U, &amp;#34;An Integrated Green Urban Electrical Grid,&amp;#34; 36 Wm. %26 Mary Envtl. L. %26 Pol~’y Rev. 671)

====Hegemony prevents the escalation of global hotspots - retrenchment causes bickering internationally over leadership and prevents cooperation.====
Zbigniew K. **Brzezinski** , February **2012**, CSIS counselor and trustee and cochairs the CSIS Advisory Board. He is also the Robert E. Osgood Professor of American Foreign Policy at the School of Advanced International Studies, Johns Hopkins University, in Washington, D.C. He is cochair of the American Committee for Peace in the Caucasus and a member of the International Advisory Board of the Atlantic Council. He is a former chairman of the American-Ukrainian Advisory Committee. He was a member of the Policy Planning Council of the Department of State from 1966 to 1968; chairman of the Humphrey Foreign Policy Task Force in the 1968 presidential campaign; director of the Trilateral Commission from 1973 to 1976; and principal foreign policy adviser to Jimmy Carter in the 1976 presidential campaign. From 1977 to 1981, Dr. Brzezinski was national security adviser to President Jimmy Carter. In 1981, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his role in the normalization of U.S.-China relations and for his contributions to the human rights and national security policies of the United States. He was also a member of the President~’s Chemical Warfare Commission (1985), the National Security Council–Defense Department Commission on Integrated Long-Term Strategy (1987–1988), and the President~’s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (1987–1989). In 1988, he was cochairman of the Bush National Security Advisory Task Force, and in 2004, he was cochairman of a Council on Foreign Relations task force that issued the report Iran: Time for a New Approach. Dr. Brzezinski received a B.A. and M.A. from McGill University (1949, 1950) and Ph.D. from Harvard University (1953). He was a member of the faculties of Columbia University (1960–1989) and Harvard University (1953–1960). Dr. Brzezinski holds honorary degrees from Georgetown University, Williams College, Fordham University, College of the Holy Cross, Alliance College, the Catholic University of Lublin, Warsaw University, and Vilnius University. He is the recipient of numerous honors and awards, &amp;#34;After America&amp;#34; http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/01/03/after_america?page=0,0
