The United States federal government should procure small modular reactors for its military installations in the United States.

According to a recent report …
…plants on the environment.


Long-term disruptions threaten critical national security missions – affects military forces globally

A terrorist attack that …
… project developers and utilities.


Military decline results in global conflict—successors won’t fill in and multiple hotspots escalate

For if America falters, the …
… slide into global turmoil.


Even if hegemony is unjust and violent—the alternative is an apolar nightmare that causes extinction

So  what is left? Waning …
… world disorder.


Social science proves—multipolarity supports the natural incentive to seek status by fighting
Wohlforth, 09 – professor of government at Dartmouth (William, “Unipolarity, Status Competition, and Great Power War,” World Affairs, January, project muse)
The upshot is a near …
… tend to be zero sum.9

There’s no way to solve the root cause of war – but hegemony and deterrence empirically reduce its likelihood and escalation

If major interstate war is ….
…… dramatically increased or decreased?


SMRs on bases ensures constant power supply

Small nuclear power …
….. overall network more robust.



Current renewables are insufficient to solve – need SMRs on bases

Glen Butler, Headquarters, North American Air Defense Command-U.S. Northern Command/J594 (Strategy, Policy, and Plans Directorate), Security Cooperation Integration Branch, 3-1-11, “Not green enough: Why the Marine Corps should lead the environmental and energy way forward and how to do it,” http://www.mca-marines.org/gazette/not-green-enough)

First, the political climate…….
………. demands boldness, not timidity.



Backup generators are insufficient – self-reliance is key

The Military – According ……
……… conduct primary missions

International tech is taking over the global nuclear market – risks widespread proliferation – DoD leadership on SMRs is key to check prolif

What we do know, however, ……
…….preserving the nonproliferation agenda.¶ 

Other countries are racing to bring SMRs to market – the only way to prevent rapid proliferation is deployment of new reactors
Colvin 11 (Joe Colvin, president of the American Nuclear Society, president and CEO of the Nuclear Energy Institute, held many senior positions with the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations, 20 years in the Navy operating a nuclear submarine, 6-7-11, testimony before the Senate Committee on Energy and National Resources, available here: http://theenergycollective.com/ansorg/58930/ans-president-joe-colvin-testifies-about-smr-legislation)

Second, new SMR designs …..
…… toward safety and nonproliferation.


Proliferation is rapid and pressures states to adopt offensive use doctrines, escalating to nuclear war and extinction 
Utgoff 2002, Deputy Director of Strategy, Forces, and Resources Division of Institute for Defense Analysis [Victor A., “Proliferation, Missile Defence and American Ambitions,” Survival, Summer, p. 87-90] 
Further, the large number of states …..
……. sheriff’s posse, even in the face of nuclear threats.


Deterrence doesn’t check conflict escalation in a world of prolif

A world populated by …
….. of access are available to terrorists. 
 


New proliferants will be especially unstable–ensures nuclear first strikes and accidents

As the situation stands, ….
….. risk factors will overlap.



Small reactors won’t make it absent military leadership

The “Valley of Death.” Given ……
….. demonstrating technical viability.32¶ 

DoD procurement is critical to ensure success of SMRs – solves regulatory issues

Notwithstanding all of these ……
……. their adoption can be achieved.


Government investment key to get SMRs off the ground – only way to retain proliferation leadership

What works for refrigerators ……
…… leverage on nonproliferation issues.
