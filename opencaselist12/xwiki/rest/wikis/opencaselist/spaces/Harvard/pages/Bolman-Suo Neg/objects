Capitalism was never a warm ... the national and international level.  

OUR ALTERNATIVE IS TO REJECT THEIR ADVOCACY IN FAVOR OF AN ASSERTION OF THE COMMUNIST HYPOTHESIS.

The 1ac’s call for further energy production amounts to a marketing plow designed to ensure that social libidinal energies remain firmly driven towards consumption. This reduces the world to a series of objects and reifies a modern subject devoid of care, causing extinction&#xD;
Stiegler ‘12 (Bernard, is Director of the Institut de recherché et d’innovation (IRI) and founder of Ars Industrialis and the Ecole de Philosophe d’Epineuil-le-Fleuriel. “Care: Within the limits of Capitalism, economizing means taking care” Telemorphosis: Theory in the Era of Climate Change Vol 1., Online)&#xD;
We all know that in no case will . . . an am- biguous expression, ascendant innovation.&#xD;
&#xD;
Capitalism reduces reality to crude economism – this instrumentality precludes ethics and results in inevitable environmental destruction&#xD;
Morgareidge ‘98 (Clayton, Prof of Philosophy at Lewis and Clark College, Why Capitalism is Evil 08/22 http://www.lclark.edu/~clayton/commentaries/evil.html)&#xD;
Now none of these philosophers are naive: . . . in religious terms, capital is the devil.&#xD;
To show why this is the case, . . . faces expressing them must be unrepresented or silenced. &#xD;
Obviously what capitalist enterprises do have consequences for . . . will ethics have a seat at the table.&#xD;
&#xD;
The alternative is to refuse institutional tinkering in favor of reinvesting decision-making with care&#xD;
This debate represents a choice—reinscribing decision-making with care is a prerequisite to challenging the drive to consume and trend toward individuation that is preventing the Left from challenging mis-growth, extinction&#xD;
Pettman ‘11 (Dominic, associate professor of culture and media at The New School , Human Error: Species-Being and Media Machines, g. 174-177)&#xD;
The issue is an urgent one because any . . . the public well rather than the private derrick.&#xD;

====2NC – Framework====&#xD;
This movement is terminally unsustainable and results in the extinction of both our social structures and cognition itself.&#xD;
Stiegler ‘10 (Bernard, Philosopher @ Goldsmiths, U. of London, and Director of the Institut de recherché et d’innovation, Taking Care of Youth and the Generations, pp. 179-184)&#xD;
In the current world, this metacare must . . . no “science” that is not ruinous.&#xD;

Technics and dis-individuation pre-determine our relation to temporality itself, which makes re-thinking the libidinal economy a prerequisite to both their predictions and calculations&#xD;
Stiegler ‘10 (Bernard, Philosopher @ Goldsmiths, U. of London, and Director of the Institut de recherché et d’innovation, Taking Care of Youth and the Generations, pp. 185-184)&#xD;
The question of what allows for and even . . . has from the outset circumvented the true problem.&#xD;
This also converts politics to fear production, kills VTL and turns the case&#xD;
Debrix and Barder ’12 (François, and Alexander, Beyond Biopolitics: Theory, violence, and horror in world politics, pp. 66)&#xD;
Among other things, what Dillon&amp;#39;s thought on . . . is indeed nothing to fear but fear itself.&#xD;

====Method Focus Bad====&#xD;
Technological thought uses an enframed historical narrative in order to project an epistemological horizon onto the future—our criticism is a prerequisite to any thinking outside of capital&#xD;
Crogan ‘10 (Patrick, an Australian researcher who has worked in what has become the Department of Creative Industries at UWE since 2008 “Bernard Stiegler: Philosophy, technics, and activism”, Cultural Politics, vol. 6)&#xD;

WE START WITH A PASSAGE FROM DON DELILLO’S UNDERWORLD:
And Viktor Maltsev says, “Yes, it’s true that geography has moved inward and smallward. But we still have mass graves, I think.”
Viktor sits near Brian, a slim figure in a leather coat. We have to shout at each other to converse above the noise that drones and rattles through the hollowed-out interior of the massive transport. He tells us the plan was originally designed for mixed loads of cargo and troops. There are dangling wires, fixtures jutting from the bulkhead. The aircraft is all cylinder, all rids and slats and shaking parts.
“It’s a company plane, Viktor?”
“I buy it this morning,” he says. “And you will use it to ship material.” 
“We fix it up good.”
His trading company is called Tchaika and they want to invite our participation in a 
AND
in the ground and vaporize it. We will get a broker’s fee.
The plane comes into heavy weather.
“There’s some concern in Phoenix,” I tell him, “about the extent of your operating capital. The kind of safety equipment we’re talking about to move highly sensitive material can result, Viktor, in expenditures that are quite dizzying.”
“Yes yes yes yes. We have expertise.” He unzippers this word with a certain defensive zest as it if sums up all the insufficiencies that have mocked him until this point. “And we have the stacks of rubles that are also quite, I may say, dizzying. You didn’t read Financial Times? I will send you.”
Brian is lying on his side wearing his coat and gloves.
“I forget,” he says. “Where are we going exactly?”
I call across the heaving body of the plane. “The Kazakh Test Site.”
“Yeah but where’s that?”
I shout. “Where are we going, Viktor?”
“Very important place that’s not on the map. Near Semipatainsk. White space on map. No problem. They will meet us.”
“No problem,” I call across to Brian.
“Thank you both. Wake me when we land,” he says.
I look at him carefully. It’s cold and we’re dead tired and I look at Brian. The knowledge of what he’s been doing, the calculated breach of trust – I want to stay awake while he sleeps so I can watch him and fine-edge my feelings and wait for my moment. 
Viktor takes a bottle of Chivas Regal out of his overnight bag. I do 
AND
Viktor pours some scotch into the cap and I return to my seat.
We have no seat belts and the passage is growing rougher. I have the 
AND
the hymnal of named flight. The scotch tastes faintly of gargled mint.
“What did you do before you joined Tchaika?”
“I tech history twenty years. Then no more. I look for a new life.”
“There are men like you in many American cities now. Russians, Ukrainians. Do you know what they do?”
“Drive taxi,” he says.
I notice the way his eyes leap to catch mine, slyly, a brief merged moment that allows him to mark my awareness of his superior status. He is drinking from the bottle.
I see the plan as if from some protected position in the sky. It is a swift shape hurtling through the dark – I felt sure it was dark by now. It is a mass of dark metal racing through the rain and wind as if in a swift scene from an old black-and-white movie, scored with urgent music.
Viktor asks me if I’ve ever witnessed a nuclear explosion. No. It is 
AND
weight. They had to convince themselves with numbers and bulk and mass.
“And the U.S.?” I say.
Eyes flicking my way, happy as carnival lights. It was the U.S., Viktor says, that designed the neutron bomb. Many buzzing neutrons, very little blast. The perfect capitalist tool. Kill people, spare property.
I watch Brian sleep.
“You have your own capitalist tools now. Don’t you, Viktor?”
“You mean my company?”
“A small private army, I hear.”
“Also intelligence unit. To protect our assets.”
“And scare the hell out of the competition.”
He tells me that the name of the company was his idea. Tchaika means seagull and refers poetically to the fact that the company’s basic business waste. He likes the way seagulls swoop down on garbage mounds and trail after ships waiting for the glint of jettison at the bow. It is a nicer name, besides, than Rat or Pig.
I look at Brian. It’s better than sleeping. I don’t want to sleep 
AND
in a cozy room somewhere. I see us hurtling through the dark.
I tell Viktor there is a curious connection between weapons and waste. I don’t 
AND
sort of bone heap and broken tool, literally from under the ground.
All those decades, he says, when we thought about weapons all the time and never thought about the dark multiplying byproduct.
“And in this case,” I say. “In our case, in our age. What we excrete comes back to consume us.”
We don’t dig it up, he says. We try to bury it. But maybe this is not enough. That’s why we have this idea. Kill the devil. And he smiles from his steeple perch. The fusion of two streams of history, weapons and waste. We destroy contaminated nuclear waste by means of nuclear explosions.

FAR FROM “FIXING” THE WASTE PROBLEM, THE 1AC INVESTS IT WITH DESIRE, MAKING IT OUR OBJET PETIT A. THAT DESTROYS OUR ABILITY TO HAVE A TRUE RELATIONSHIP TO THE WORLD 
MCGOWAN ‘5 (Todd, Prof. of Film Studies @ U. of Vermont, “The Obsolescence of Mystery and the Accumulation of Waste in Don DeLillo’s Underworld” Critique, Vol. 46.2, pp. 123-125)
In Americana, Don DeLillo’s first novel, one of the characters, Buford Long
AND
threatens to consume us but also occupies most of our time and energy.
We are producing more and more waste without anywhere to put it, and thus 
AND
). In Underworld, waste is everywhere, and it has become holy.
DeLillo does not simply chronicle the proliferation of garbage and its apotheosis in contemporary American 
AND
manifestation of self-absorption and a lack of contact with the Other.
In Beyond the Pleasure Principle, Freud discusses biology as a metaphor for the functioning 
AND
an influx of new “vital differences” that can sustain the subject.
At this point, Freud’s often-condemned “biologism” and Lacan’s understanding of 
AND
the Other has lost this mysterious object that it once seemed to contain.
In Underworld, DeLillo chronicles the disappearance of the objet petit a in the Other 
AND
the novel consists in helping us to come to terms with this shift.

GEOPOLITICAL BENEFITS ARE THE MACGUFFIN IN THE AFFIRMATIVE’S TALE. THEY DRIVE THE NARRATIVE, PROVIDE IT WITH A FALSE COHESION, AND KEEP OUR INTEREST. IN THE END, HOWEVER, THE REAL CHARACTER IS “WASTE,” THE KEY IS LOOKING THROUGH THE VIOLENCE THAT CONSTANTLY DISTRACT US.
VAN WYCK ‘4 (Peter C., Professor and Graduate Program Director of Comm. @ Concordia U., Signs of Danger: Waste, Trauma, and Nuclear Threat, pp. x-xii)
As one brings a work to its conclusion, it seems inevitable to wonder if 
AND
wonder if it is possible that the angel is pointing the wrong way.

ONLY A CATASTROPHIC ECOLOGY SOLVES THE AFF AND MAKES OCEAN RELATIONSHIP POSSIBLE
MENTZ ’12 (Steve, professor of English at St. John’s University in New York City, “After Sustainability” PMLA, pp. 586-588)
IT SEEMED LIKE A GOOD IDEA WHILE IT LASTED, BUT WE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN 
AND
skin is disruptive. Our environment changes constantly, unexpectedly, often painfully.
Moving beyond happy fictions of sustainability need not mean consigning ourselves to an unintelligible ecosphere
AND
After sustainability, we need dynamic narratives about our relation to the biosphere.
The most forthright public declaration of the postsustainability world comes from Bill McKibben. McKibben’s 
AND
experiences suggest that departures from stability—catastrophes—constitute the real normal.
Intellectual frameworks for postsustainability appear in the two modeling sciences whose names are built on 
AND
we expect and encounter radical disruption in all natural systems at all times.
Recent efforts to bridge postmodern theory and environmental literary criticism address ecocriticism’s delay in following 
AND
dynamic and painful environment. Large parts of this history involve salt water.
Moving beyond sustainability requires different models for thinking about nonstable systems. That’s where the 
AND
requires ornate provisional systems and visionary narrative glimpses of being in the world.
Fortunately, the poets have been there before us.

SECURITIZATION OF FOOD IS PART OF THE MASTER NARRATIVE OF MODERNITY – INFINITE PROGRESS, MAN CONQUERS NATURE – THAT CAN ONLY RESULT IN VIOLENCE AND CAPITALIST DESTRUCTION

None of the foregoing will come as news to ecocritics or environmental rhetoricians, and

minimally necessary to critique the disabling rhetoric of the mainstream food security discourse. 
Toward that goal, I examine one such struggle, that between what I&amp;#39;ll call

The likely response from Fortress North Americans about such scenarios will be calls for an 
AND
international agricultural markets when policy-makers intervene to secure domestic food needs. 
Their point is that implementing restrictive trade policies does not make a country more food secure, only more vulnerable when it suffers its own poor harvests. This continent, then, cannot afford to look away as other parts of the world struggle with food shortfalls, imagining that North America can pursue food autarky. The next disastrous heat wave may not be in Russia or China, but in Iowa or Saskatchewan. 
Higher food prices are by no means the direst consequence for North Americans as global

Our alternative is to refuse the neoliberal enclosure of offshore rigs for the purpose of fracking. Instead, we imagine offshore rigs used otherwise

There are two ways of thinking the offshore platform: our way suggests that these become spaces for a reconceptualization of life away from neoliberal capitalism and resource extraction. However, far from a step toward sustainability, the aff’s retreat into the Ocean for drilling mimicks a history of science fictional yearning for an escape from the greed and corruption of Earth to an autonomous, isolated world re-entrenching market logic

Our interp: aff reads a topical plan and neg tests the plan or its psychopolitical commitments.
The role of the ballot is to analyze the place of desire. State politics have been replaced by economic agents defining our behavior and what counts as knowledge – this is psychopower. They are a marketing strategy, which make some drives seem more productive, and the advantages are diversions of our attention.
As knowledge is off-loaded from the individual to economic structures, we lose attention which is the internal link to trust. Education collapses and absence of care becomes our relation to the world. 
This is terminally unsustainable and results in the extinction of our social structures and cognition itself.
Stiegler ‘10 (Bernard, Philosopher @ Goldsmiths, U. of London, and Director of the Institut de recherché et d’innovation, Taking Care of Youth and the Generations, pp. 179-184)
In the current world, this metacare must become a psychopolitics, an industrial politics of

Aff framework evidence goes our way – they don’t make us policymakers, they make us consultants: irresonsibly crafting marketing strategies, incapable of advocating social change. Judge choice proves: consultants never responsible for suggestions, flips how you evaluate: if you think they’re irresponsible in their knowledge production, choose to vote against them for that

Debate is “memory” where knowledge is collectively stored. Framework is the ultimate marketing strategy. We should envision a debate of care directed against the forces of capitalism eviscerating our capacity to think. They don’t get a plan because it reacts to a non-existent model of the world. 
The only portable skill debate gives us is investing desire in politics. They render the activity unsustainable, converting debate into an elite consultants’ summit which enforces cartel consciousness between companies – plan in a vacuum is smooth consultant jive. 
Mason ’13 (Arthur, Assistant Professor, Justice and Social Inquiry, School of Social Transformation, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences @ Arizona State U., “Cartel Consciousness and Horizontal Integration in Energy Industry” Cultures of Energy: Power, Practices, Technologies, 2013, pp. 136)

It doesn’t matter what decisions they give the judge, politics will continue to reproduce status quo violence unless it starts from the individual’s ability to be invested in the question of the aff itself. Arguments about other actors miss the point: politics has failed and only youth can create an alternative future.

Overview
Capitalism is driven by mis-growth – drive-based, rather than desire-based, subjects endlessly consume objects without a relation of care. Infinite creation of industrial objects has out-paced our capacity for attention. There is too much happening, so we off-load our intelligence to machines and culture, that’s dis-individuation.  The 1AC doesn’t just export tech, it exports our drive economy globally makes collapse inevitable and administration impossible: we lose TRUST in capitalism. They’ve conceded extinction: speculation causes economic wars of infinite magnitude and global desert of being, their defense is only CAPITALISM, not the speculative version Stiegler says is collapsing.

====The 1AC~’s insistence upon re-energizing debate ignores a few truths about theory and debate – the movement toward the body, toward affirming energy and human potentiality is not a NEW mode of praxis but the subject of countless academic debates, conferences, books, etc. Policy debates over identity, bodies, social location have been around for roughly a decade, they~’ve caused people to change how they relate to issues of race, identity, sexuality.====

====However, today theory is running into a wall: what do these important investigations mean for a world dangerously out of sync due to global climate change which is challenging everything we know about where we~’re from, who we are, and where we~’re going. Perhaps a decentering away from the human is a necessary first step====
**Colebrook ~’11** (Claire, Edwin Erle Sparks Professor of English @ Penn State U., &amp;#34;Extinct Theory&amp;#34; Theory After Theory, pp. 64-67)
Theory ~’today~’ is not an acceptance that we . . . not immediately present to a subject of action.

====The 1AC was haunting but it couldn~’t stop there – it had to be confirmed. Again, after the CEDA finals.====


====It~’s not enough to perform: it has to be interpreted, confirmed by the big Other of debate and legitimized through the ballot. To prove what? Inclusion in an activity that none of us believe is revolutionary?====


====Like Warhol and Pollock, hanging in the museum of debate means death, not change. Institutionalizing their criticism destroys its radicality by making them &amp;#34;debate&amp;#34; high schoolers throw around in framework debates. Debate is their mousetrap.====

&#xD;
This constant navigation of past failures – with keywords like frontiers, rurality, spatial inequality, etc – ignore how the climate crisis demonstrates that modernist problems were themselves the result of modernist subject positions. &#xD;
&#xD;
Their angel wants to look back and re-write the history of uranium and imperialism, but it is not to correct that history. Instead the Angel looks back because he knows we want him to; knows that the modern needs reassurance of our chosen path.&#xD;
Cohen ‘12 (Tom, Prof of English and Co-Director for the Institute on Critical Climate Change at the University of Albany, “Murmurations—“Climate Change” and the Defacement of Theory” Telemorphosis: Theory in the Era of Climate Change Vol 1., Online)&#xD;
Bruno Latour, as observed above, offered a curious fable in which he identifies &#xD;
AND&#xD;
evil of which it is, adamantly, structurally, and violently unaware.&#xD;
&#xD;
More Modern, More Problems – the aff’s call to raise the banner of sustainability in response to a socio-cultural war against Appalachian populations locks them firmly inside Modern structures of thought – Marxist organization, critiques of subjectivity – which have been rendered dangerous and unsustainable by climate change&#xD;
Clark ‘8 (Timothy, Prof of English Studies, Durham University, “Towards a deconstructive environmental criticism”, Oxford Literary Review, 30 (1))&#xD;
The environmental crisis is inherently deconstructive, viciously so, of current modes of thought &#xD;
AND&#xD;
itself pushed from a reformist agenda towards a more revolutionary and anarchist one? &#xD;
&#xD;
Vote negative to disoccupy the political space opened by the affirmative and reject the quest to think novel solutions to nuclear crisis&#xD;
&#xD;
This act of disidentification is a prerequisite to revealing the violent implications of modern subjectivity. When the aff says debate is to create “openness to the other,” they diagnose the problem but are wrong in the answer: we need to give up on progress before the war can disappear&#xD;
Cohen ‘12 (Tom, Prof of English and Co-Director for the Institute on Critical Climate Change at the University of Albany, “Murmurations—“Climate Change” and the Defacement of Theory” Telemorphosis: Theory in the Era of Climate Change Vol 1., Online)&#xD;
At the moment of writing it is common to point to the 2011 “occupy&#xD;
AND&#xD;
to, a violence before which no model of sovereignty can be sustained.&#xD;

Humanity sees itself as responsible for all environemntal destruction, producing guilt and ressentiment directed at the self, producing a will to self-annihilation
Jean Baudrillard, Professor of Sociology and Philosophy @ Multiple universities, 2007, “Darwin’s Artificial Ancestors and the Terroristic Dream of the Transparency of the Good” International Journal of Baudrillard Studies Volume 4, number 2 
All this has been brought about by the highly dubious way in which the concept 
AND
has already won out, the sacrificing of the species to boundless experimentation.

The 1AC foregrounds the natural environment of the Appalachian mountains – this creates an aesthetics of nature that is fundamentally anti-ecological
Morton 7 (Timothy Morton, Professor and Rita Shea Guffey Chair in English at Rice University, 2007, “Toward a Theory of Ecological Criticism” in Ecology Without Nature)

Nobody likes it when you mention the unconscious, and nowadays, hardly anybody likes 
AND
think through an argument about what we mean by the word environment itself.

This fuels the exact same system of capitalist relations they attempt to solve
Morton 7 (Timothy Morton, Professor and Rita Shea Guffey Chair in English at Rice University, 2007, “Ecology Without Nature”)

One of the ideas inhibiting genuinely ecological politics, ethics, philosophy, and art 
AND
and “them.” With ecological friends like this, who needs enemies?

The alternative is to reject their foregrounding of nature in favor of a theory of environment-as-background. 
Morton 7 (Timothy Morton, Professor and Rita Shea Guffey Chair in English at Rice University, 2007, “Imagining Ecology without Nature” in Ecology Without Nature)

Place, even according to this Edwardian miniature, is radically indeterminate—it is 
AND
but it is also the message of Lacan’s sustained reading of Descartes’ cogito.

Their call for solidarity commodifies Otherness into of calcified systems of thought that are incapable of coming to terms with the radical otherness of climate crisis.
Cohen ‘12 (Tom, Prof of English and Co-Director fo the Institute on Critical Climate Change at the University of Albany, “Murmurations—“Climate Change” and the Defacement of Theory” Telemorphosis: Theory in the Era of Climate Change Vol 1., Online)

Judith Butler’s Precarious Life 2005 redressed the defaced “other” of the 
AND
which we retroactively domesticate as that which served to open up our home.
