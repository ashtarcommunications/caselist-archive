Advantage 1 is environmental leadership -

First internal link is perception – developing a green Native economy places the US in excellent stead internationally

Contention 3 is solvency – 

Increasing incentives for renewable investment in native territories solves for investment, development of economies, and international signal

Yet Indigenous peoples are not dealing entirely with a rigged game. The direct involvement of ……..generated the global climate change cri- sis in the first place.

Only the plan works – every strategy that isn’t federal incentives for renewables fails – plan reinvigorates the trust doctrine to reduce dependency on the government
Mills 6 (Andrew D. Mills Submitted in partial satisfaction of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science In the Energy and Resources Group of the University of California, Berkeley, “Wind Energy in Indian Country: Turning to Wind for the Seventh Generation”)

====No way that Romney wins – electoral politics, history, and polls all prove====
**Downie 10/4 (James Downie writes for the Washington Post.  &amp;#34;Obama lost the first debate, but he will still win the election&amp;#34;)**
http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/post/obama-lost-the-first-debate-but-he-will-still-win-the-election/2012/10/04/9c3b7eb8-0deb-11e2-bd1a-b868e65d57eb_blog.html-http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/post/obama-lost-the-first-debate-but-he-will-still-win-the-election/2012/10/04/9c3b7eb8-0deb-11e2-bd1a-b868e65d57eb_blog.html

In case you had not heard yet, President Obama had a poor first debate 
AND
Romney, the path the race is stuck on ends with his defeat.

====Plan is congressional trust responsibility – no reason Obama is perceived as lead actor====

====Fights over incentives for energy production now—-already impacting the election====
**AP, 9/21/12, &amp;#34;Congress not acting on wind-energy credits&amp;#34;, www.iowafarmertoday.com/staff/congress-not-acting-on-wind-energy-credits/article_7540b4ee-041e-11e2-960f-0019bb2963f4.html**
There is little hope Congress will act quickly to extend a federal energy tax credit for building wind turbines, despite the likelihood letting the program expire could lead to the loss of thousands of jobs.
The issue is particularly important in Iowa, where 20 percent of electricity is generated by wind turbines and the state ranks second behind only Texas for installed wind capacity. An estimated 7,000 workers in Iowa are employed in more than 250 businesses associated with the wind industry.
Extension of the tax credit is caught up in deep differences over spending in Congress, where fiscal conservatives in the Republican Party are fighting renewal even as other GOP members push to have the program continued.
The issue also has spilled into the presidential race, with Democratic President Barack Obama supporting the credit and Republican Mitt Romney opposing it, angering Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley and Gov. Terry Branstad.

**====No link uniqueness – there are plenty of energy issues the GOP can spin that exist already to hurt Obama like Solyndra – a new renewable policy doesn~’t hurt him====**

====Obama already vocally supports native wind====

The respected polling firm Gallup asked voters in August what the most important issue facing 
AND
that it~’s a high top-of-mind issue in the campaign.&amp;#34;

====Past issues, not current issues, will decide the election. ====
**ill 9/3** (David, writer @ The Washington Post, http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/sep/3/who-wins-the-election-most-in-academia-predict-oba/-http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/sep/3/who-wins-the-election-most-in-academia-predict-oba/) (Mr. Lichtman-http://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/allan-j-lichtman/, a history professor at American University, has developed a model that predicts the outcome of any presidential race by looking at the candidates~’ standing with respect to 13 key political factors. He debuted the model in 1980 — using data from the 1860 to 1976 elections — and says it has correctly forecast every winner since then)

The Republicans hoped to sway voters into their favor during last week~’s Republican National Convention, and Democrats will try to do the same at their convention this week. However, Mr. Lichtman-http://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/allan-j-lichtman/ said that despite the furious campaigning that is sure to come from now until November, elections are seldom decided by events and campaign strategies in the final months and are more a reaction to circumstances over the past several years.

====No Romney vote switching on fossil fuels good====
**Lewis, 10/1/12** - senior contributor to The Daily Caller  (Matt, The Daily Caller, &amp;#34;Mitt Romney~’s struggle to win blue collar Ohio voters&amp;#34;

This sounds trivial, but it matters greatly — especially in places like Ohio.
The Atlantic~’s Molly Ball is consistently a &amp;#34;must read,&amp;#34; and her latest column reinforces a point I~’ve been making for a long time — that Mitt Romney is in danger of under-performing with working-class whites in key states like the Buckeye state. (Ball~’s teaser says it all: &amp;#34;In Appalachian coal country, Romney is now viewed with nearly as much suspicion as Obama — and that may be the story of the 2012 election.&amp;#34;)
There is at least one substantive reason for these voters to be skeptical of Romney. While interviewing Ohio voters, Ball stumbled over an interesting blast from the past:
It turns out Romney, as governor of Massachusetts in 2003, held a press conference in front of a coal-fired power plant. &amp;#34;I will not create jobs or hold jobs that kill people,&amp;#34; he said, and then, gesturing at the facility behind him: &amp;#34;That plant, that plant kills people.&amp;#34; You can see the footage in an Obama campaign ad that~’s been airing heavily here. It seems to have made an impression.
The notion that Romney would be worse for coal than Obama seems absurd. Still, Obama is using the line to effectively muddy the waters. All he really needs is for voters to conclude, &amp;#34;they~’re both bad,&amp;#34; and Obama can consider that a victory. Ball sums it up thusly,
I heard it over and over again from Ohioans — the idea that Romney stands for the wealthy and not for them. Obama~’s depiction of his rival as an out-of-touch rich guy, which has gotten no little assistance from Romney himself, has made a deep and effective impression with these self-consciously working-class voters.


====No one cares about natives====
**Kilpatrick 90 (James J. Kilpatrick  Universal Press Syndicate, Sunday, July 1, 1990 &amp;#34;Lost Souls — Native Americans: Who Really Cares?&amp;#34; http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19900701%26slug=1079987)**
- Out of sight, they say, is out of mind. The aphorism applies with singular accuracy to the nation~’s 900,000 native Indians. Other minority groups have their vociferous defenders. Almost no one speaks for the Indian tribes.
Why am I writing about Indian affairs? I truly don~’t know. An interesting case cropped up last month in the Supreme Court. I ran into Arizona~’s Sen. John McCain in the Capitol a few days ago, and we fell to talking about the status of Indians in our society.
Their status, said McCain, is just about nil: ``Nobody cares deeply about the Indians. Congress doesn~’t care. The White House doesn~’t care. The states don~’t care. Over the past 15 years, every part of the federal budget has increased in constant dollars - every part but one. That one is the budget for Indian affairs.~’~’

====Controversial policies and spending helps Obama====
**Shlaes 3-30**-12, Amity, Bloomberg News, Senior fellow and director of the Four Percent Project at the George W. Bush Institute, http://www.amestrib.com/sections/opinion/columns/amity-shlaes-obama-loser-who-wins-roosevelt-1936.html

The loser wins. That~’s the way it can go in presidential elections. Especially when the ballot involves a likable incumbent who happens to be failing when it comes to helping the U.S. economy.
In the case of President Barack Obama, the loser the president most resembles is the one he evokes with his radio addresses: Franklin D. Roosevelt. Roosevelt came into office in 1933 on a ticket of recovery. Neither employment nor the stock market returned to pre-crash levels by 1936. Yet FDR won that year, taking all but two of 48 states.
A side-by-side comparison of presidential records and the campaigns of 1936 and 2012 suggests how Obama might fare, too. The resemblance starts, of course, with the poor quality of the underlying economy in those first four years.
The United States grew from 1933 to 1936, but neither the stock market nor the unemployment levels got back to where they had been at the market crash in 1929. Today, our data also sketch recovery, but neither the Dow Jones Industrial Average nor employment is back to pre-crash levels.
The second feature Obama and Roosevelt share is bad policy. More than anything else, the post-2008 economy has required a stable environment where the government stays out of the way. This administration has preferred to jump in.
Why the victory, then or now? The first is the sympathy vote. Voters identified with a president who was embattled; Roosevelt managed to make a dragon of business and the economy when the true cause of the downturn~’s duration was policy.
Roosevelt also convinced voters patience was necessary even though he had made speed of change the central issue: the New Deal plan offered in 1933 was not the &amp;#34;100 Months,&amp;#34; it was the Hundred Days.
Obama, too, draws sympathy, partly because economics is not his main area, either. He also seems able to convince voters long-term improvement will substitute for his early promise of instant delivery. 
Other advantages? Backloading. The worst pain resulting from administration policy is backloaded to occur after November 2012, when tax increases come and Obamacare takes hold. Roosevelt signed Social Security into law in 1935. But only in 1937, after Roosevelt won, did the government levy the new payroll tax. 
Then there is spending. Roosevelt spent systematically. Obama, too, came out spending and kept doing so. 
A final force in play might be called the &amp;#34;country as stock&amp;#34; fallacy. In the world of stocks and bonds, we are accustomed to looking at snapshots: how much a stock price increased over a year. The same snapshot habit has carried over to the gross domestic product.


====Impossible to predict what presidents do the in the second term and Obama would accomplish less====

**====Walsh 3-29-12, Kenneth, chief White House correspondent for U.S. News %26 World Report, http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/Ken-Walshs-Washington/2012/03/29/obama-should-not-count-on-second-term-flexibility====**
Another factor in evaluating Obama~’s assessment is that it~’s impossible to predict exactly what policies he would adopt in a second term and how the political system would react, scholars say. This idea is at the core of Republican concerns that Obama might have a &amp;#34;hidden agenda&amp;#34; in the future.
~~Republicans Suggest Obama is Hiding Real Agenda~~
Daniel W. Drezner, a professor of international politics at the Fletcher School of Law and diplomacy at Tufts University, points out that the second terms of the last three re-elected presidents—Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush—took different courses than their first terms.
Writing on the Foreign Policy Magazine website, Drezner says, &amp;#34;Recent second-termers have not reverted to their ideological bliss point—if anything, it~’s been the reverse; they~’ve tacked away from their starting point&amp;#34; as they adjusted to changing circumstances and, in Reagan~’s case, new opportunities.
Drezner points out that Reagan shifted from attacking the Soviet Union as an &amp;#34;evil 
AND
ordering the invasion of Iraq without United Nations approval in his first term..
Of course, there also seems to be at least one political, policy, or personal disaster in every second term, partly because presidents and their aides tend to over-reach or make serious errors after they don~’t have to face the voters anymore. Reagan had the Iran-Contra scandal. Clinton had the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Bush had the scandalously weak government response to Hurricane Katrina.

Second, new SMR designs employ the latest generation suite of safety features. Obviously, we are all saddened by the Japanese earthquake and tsunami and its impact on the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.

Third, there is a national security aspect to the development of U.S. SMR technology that must be considered. Beyond the U.S., over 60 countries have expressed interest in developing new nuclear energy generation capacity. While some of these countries already have existing nuclear plants, others would be new entrants, many of whom are from the developing world which do not have electrical grids that can absorb a 1-GW nuclear plant in their current configuration.&#xD;

The failure of the federal government to recognize that many tribes are capable of independent decision-making would see tribal nations &amp;#34;frozen in a perpetual state of tutelage.&amp;#34; n155

Federal restrictions allow for arbitrary interference in Native energy projects and are antithetical to Native sovereignty

The decision not to transfer responsibility to the tribe can be made during the consultation process if …… that governs tribal resource development, to truly unleash the power of tribal wind.

Contention 2 is native economies – 
The status quo allows for cycles of structural violence to occur on Native lands~-~--sovereign development of renewable energy is necessary to combat fossil fuel colonialism

Advantage 2 is warming

Native lands are prime areas for renewables development and can operate as laboratories that can be modeled

There are numerous reasons to support the development ……other industry players~-~-such as state governments~-~-can learn. 12

Native renewables can offset immense amounts of carbon emissions
Gough 2 (Robert Gough,  Robert Gough, is an attorney (University of Minnesota) with graduate degrees in sociology (Fordham University) and cultural anthropology (University of Wisconsin), specializing in cultural ecology, and working with American Indian Tribes on cultural and natural resource issues over the past twenty years.

The Native Peoples on North American occupy a unique position as Indigenous Peoples …… that necessary to meet the Kyoto target for the entire United States for the 1999 emission levels. 11
This is key to stave off climate change that threatens native survival – warming is real and anthropogenic and only native peoples can solve
Parker et al 6 (Alan Parker, Zoltán Grossman, Edward Whitesell, Brett Stephenson, Terry Williams, Preston Hardison, Laural Ballew, Brad Burnham, Jill Bushnell, and Renée Klosterman, “Executive Summary: Indigenous peoples are the “miner’s canary” of global climate change.” In Climate Change and Pacific Rim Indigenous Nations, Published in October 2006 by the Northwest Indian Applied Research Institute (NIARI), The Evergreen State College, Olympia, Washington, USA)
Indigenous peoples are the “miner’s canary” of global climate change for the rest of humanity. ……. must include mechanisms to ensure the sustained financial and administrative sup- port for their implementation.

Contention 3 is solvency – 


Plan resolves economic development in line with indigenous culture –sends signal of native sovereignty globally

Moreover, the development of alternative energy projects in Indian country ……..and participating in building the infrastructure required to support green energy.&amp;#34;57

Framing the plan through federal trust responsibility is key – creates self sufficiency – actually developing energy is key too
Grossman 6 (Zoltán, Member of the Faculty in Geography / Native American and World Indigenous Peoples Studies, The Evergreen State College (Olympia, Washington), “International Indigenous Responses” in Climate Change and Pacific Rim Indigenous Nations, October 2006) Northwest Indian Applied Research Institute (NIARI), The Evergreen State College, Olympia, Washington, USA)
Yet Indigenous peoples are not dealing entirely with a rigged game. The direct involvement of recognized …….. corporate control of the energy economy—the status quo that generated the global climate change cri- sis in the first place.

Only the plan works – every strategy that isn’t federal incentives for renewables fails – plan reinvigorates the trust doctrine to reduce dependency on the government
Mills 6 (Andrew D. Mills Submitted in partial satisfaction of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science In the Energy and Resources Group of the University of California, Berkeley, “Wind Energy in Indian Country: Turning to Wind for the Seventh Generation”)
The third justification for energy development is that energy development promotes …… development is often associated with economic development for tribes because it builds capacity and promotes self-determination. Many tribes feel that without the funds from energy projects they would be chronically dependent on fickle federal funds.

Failure to support the Trust Doctrine leave no check on federal and state relationships with tribes – the trust doctrine can act as a successful balance of power of sovereignty within states

Reforming TERA is key to outside investment and Native ownership 
Royster 12—Professor of Law and Co-Director, Native American Law Center, University of Tulsa College of Law (Judith, Tribal Energy Development: Renewables and the Problem of the Current Statutory Structures, 31 Stan. Envtl. L.J. 91)

The non-minerals statutes that might be used for renewable energy development share a pair of significant disadvantages. …….. however, the TERA process may be more of a barrier than an opportunity. n135



The policy possibilities for native peoples are prefigured by western epistemological frames of reference for decision-making that are dominated by elite interests bent on resource exploitation – we should rethink the value structure implied by western epistemologies that systematically eliminate native people’s interests from politics – affirming reciprocity, holistic tribal knowledge, and the perspective of future generations within our decision frames is necessary for survival of the whole environment

(Linda, Indigenous Knowledge and Technology, The American Indian Quarterly 26.2 (2002) 198-220)
As we begin to examine the relationship between American Indians and environmental justice, it is important to note that American courts have many times in the past criminalized, whether consciously or not, traditional knowledge. Indian people who have challenged multinational corporate giants and the government through political activism in an effort to halt environmentally destructive projects on their lands have been criminalized and arrested to silence their claims. Leaving traditional knowledge out of environmental ………. that Native peoples of the Americas present to our global society can be utilized in many ways, if given the chance.
