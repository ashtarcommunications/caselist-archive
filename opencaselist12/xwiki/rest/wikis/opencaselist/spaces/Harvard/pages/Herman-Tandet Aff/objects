The likelihood is that in the coming years deterrence will put much more emphasis on

Mr. Bishop joined Northeast Utilities in 1977 where, in addition to being Corporate Secretary, his responsibilities included resolving legal issues associated with the licensing and operation of the company’s four nuclear power plants. In 1987, he took the position of Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of Nuclear Management and Resources Council, Inc., a Washington, D.C.-based association that was being established by the nuclear industry to address generic technical, regulatory, and legal issues facing the nuclear energy industry. He served in comparable positions in its successor, the Nuclear Energy Institute, Inc., until his retirement in July, 2005., http://debateandtherealworld.com/article.php?id=4)

Scenario: Severe Degradation of U.S. Naval Capabilities. The primary reason 
AND
and no other nation possesses the means or the will to do so.
Therefore, in considering the present value of sea power, it is more useful to create a scenario in which U.S. sea power declines quickly and radically rather than one in which it is slowly superseded. In essence, this scenario divines the worth of an asset by evaluating the impact of its absence.
The scenario described here is inspired by work done by Decision Strategies International (DSI) for the U.S. Navy’s Strategic Planning Process, with which one of the authors was loosely associated in 2006–2007.9
In this scenario, events unfold in a world that is very unstable and unsafe. International cooperation declines dramatically as countries hoard natural resources and the U.S. struggles against the strength of other resource-rich and economically robust regions of the world.
