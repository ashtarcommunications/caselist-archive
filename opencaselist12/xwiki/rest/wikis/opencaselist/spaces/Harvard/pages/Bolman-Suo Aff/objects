Kirsch 5 (Scott Kirsch, assistant professor of geography at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 2005, “Proving Grounds: Project Plowshare and the Unrealized Dream of Nuclear Earthmoving”, pp. 1-6)&#xD;
&#xD;
In September 1964, the U.S. ... the bomb into something good.&#xD;
&#xD;
Scott Kirsch describes how Project Plowshare was the pinnacle of the nuclear imaginary – it was earthmoving on the scale of the universe, fracking with nuclear weapons and capturing the energy from the blast. While policymakers were placing the Bomb at the nexus of our national fantasy, these nuclear engineers imagined a different future for their atom: they wanted to turn the bomb into something good.&#xD;
&#xD;
But why the Bomb? Why is it so central to our cultural imaginary, our debate imaginary?&#xD;
&#xD;
We are haunted by the unmeaning of life, the gap between our ideals and reality. We forge symbols to bridge this gap – this religiosity allowed us to participate in the infinitude of Being itself.&#xD;
Chernus 91 (Ira Chernus, Professor of Religious Studies at the University of Colorado, Boulder, 1991, “Nuclear Madness: Religion and Psychology of the Nuclear Age”, pp. 47-51)&#xD;
&#xD;
There are obviously problems in ... us &amp;#34;the courage to be.&amp;#34;&#xD;
&#xD;
The Bomb represents and enforces an order of radical finitude – the ultimate triumph of technological reason and machinic thought. But the process of symbolization continues behind the veil of rationality – we become neurotics, fearing the infinite even as we deny the possibility of its existence.&#xD;
Chernus 91 (Ira Chernus, Professor of Religious Studies at the University of Colorado, Boulder, 1991, “Nuclear Madness: Religion and Psychology of the Nuclear Age”, pp. 62-67)&#xD;
&#xD;
Tillich&amp;#39;s thought opens up a ... the risk of our lives.&#xD;
&#xD;
Every attempt to control or harness nuclear violence participates in this literalism – the idiolect of the death-machine cult. Paradoxically, this only increases our hunger for symbols, and the nuclear fantasy takes deeper root in our psyches – we look to the Bomb for the infinitude we’re missing, investing it with religious meaning&#xD;
Chernus 86 (Ira Chernus, Professor of Religious Studies at the University of Colorado, Boulder, “Dr. Strangegod: On the Symbolic Meaning of Nuclear Weapons”, pp. 153-155)&#xD;
&#xD;
Moreover, even if we could ... line between literalism and fantasy.&#xD;
&#xD;
The ultimate result of nuclear worship is global extinction – nuclear religion underpins infinite violence, rendering life meaningless and sustaining a mechanical system of war and environmental destruction – we seek constant risk to touch the infinite, making nuclear war inevitable&#xD;

&#xD;
The similarities between the Bomb ... to the Bomb as God.&#xD;
&#xD;
Thus Suo and I affirm that&#xD;
The United States Federal Government should substantially reduce restrictions on energy production from nuclear weapons&#xD;
&#xD;
The solution to nuclear madness is more madness – an explosion of fantasy structured by the container of the resolution, a radical embrace of the “disease” as our cure. Affirming the plan literally only plays into the neurosis of radical finitude; instead, our affirmative recognizes debate for what it is: a fantasy. &#xD;
Chernus 91 (Ira Chernus, Professor of Religious Studies at the University of Colorado, Boulder, 1991, “Nuclear Madness: Religion and Psychology of the Nuclear Age”, pp. 268-272)&#xD;

&#xD;
The renaissance we seek must ... heart of the peace process.&#xD;
&#xD;
The demand for predictability re-enacts the fundamental religious conflict between cosmos and chaos – the attempt to seal off a finite portion of the topic only engenders greater chaos and is part of a violent resistance to infinitude that underpins infinite war and makes change impossible&#xD;
Chernus 91 (Ira Chernus, Professor of Religious Studies at the University of Colorado, Boulder, 1991, “Nuclear Madness: Religion and Psychology of the Nuclear Age”, pp. 193-199)&#xD;
&#xD;
Eliade&amp;#39;s images of homo religiosus ... what the problem really is.&#xD;
&#xD;
Framework is a mutual conspiracy of terror – there are rules against rules against rules, repressing the awareness that there alternative ways of relating to debate – makes true decisionmaking impossible&#xD;
Chernus 91 (Ira Chernus, Professor of Religious Studies at the University of Colorado, Boulder, 1991, “Nuclear Madness: Religion and Psychology of the Nuclear Age”, pp. 43-45)&#xD;

====Counterinterp: pedagogy is a form of affirmation. The role of the ballot is to endorse the team which best activates our political agency as debaters====

====Debate is not just a meaningless game – it can be a microcosm of what we hope politics can become – Giroux indicates that debate can prefigure change, not just discuss it====
Resolved is to reduce by mental analysis, **Random House 11** (http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/resolve)
Should indicates desirability, **OED 11** (http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/should?region=us)

====USFG = the people====
**Howard, 2005** (Adam, &amp;#34;Jeffersonian Democracy: Of the People, By the People, For the People,&amp;#34; http://www.byzantinecommunications.com/adamhoward/homework/highschool/jeffersonian.html, 5/27)

Ideally, then, under Jeffersonian Democracy, the government is the people, and people is the government. Therefore, if a particular government ceases to work for the good of the people, the people may and ought to change that government or replace it. Governments are established to protect the people~’s rights using the power they get from the people.
Substantially is : being largely but not wholly that which is specified a substantial lie **Merriam Webster 11**

We reduce p rest. Increase financial incent
T no aprori


====The energy regime inscribes a consumption-obsessed neoliberal subjectivity which causes extinction – that~’s Glover – ecopedagogy is only way to reclaim our agency. ====

====We~’re key to half the topic – renewables are unworkable under the demands of the current energy regime – that~’s Byrne====

====Academic debate is being dismantled by casino capitalism – internal link turns all their standards – that~’s Giroux====

====Reasonability – voting aff doesn~’t eradicate policy debate – we just have to prove that we~’re acceptable====


====Aff choice – burden of rejoinder means the negative needs to actually answer our arguments – anything else is regressively anti-educational====

===2AC Curriculum===

====Their ev all terrible doesn~’t support their model of debate====


====Content-learning disintction is stupid – narrow view of instrumental schooling that Giroux critiques====

====The curriculum has been coopted by violent neoliberal forces – debate key====
**Hill 10** (Dave Hill is professor of education policy at the University of Northampton, England, and professor of education at Middlesex University, London, England. 2010. Revolutionizing Pedagogy: Education for Social Justice Within and Beyond Global Neo-Liberalism. Eds. Sheila Macrine, Peter McLaren, and Dave Hill, pp. 135-138)

Impacts on Democracy and on Critical Thinking The neoconservative faces of education reform, indeed
AND
, socialist society: in that way we maintain our dignity and hope.


====An imposed top-down curriculum can only be anti-democratic====
**Smyth 10** (John Smyth is a research professor of education at the University of Ballarat. 2010. Revolutionizing Pedagogy: Education for Social Justice Within and Beyond Global Neo-Liberalism. Eds. Sheila Macrine, Peter McLaren, and Dave Hill, pp. 191-192)

Teachers need to be political actors in their educational settings by being clear about the 
AND
students in ways that go considerably beyond many current inauthentic and tokenistic attempts.


====Our inclusion in the curriculum solves extinction====
**Darder 10** (Professor Antonia Darder, Distinguished Professor of Education, University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign, &amp;#34;Preface&amp;#34; in Critical Pedagogy, Ecoliteracy, %26 Planetary Crisis: The Ecopedagogy Movement by Richard V. Kahn, 2010, pp. xiv-xvi)

True to this dictum, Kahn unambiguously demands that the survival of the planet (
AND
denigrated our cultural ways and attempted to disable our life-sustaining capacities. 


===2AC Predictibility/Limits===

====Predictability is a practice – ====

====We don~’t destroy predictability – we still you have to be related to the resolution – K of neolib is key to energy questions that~’s byrne====


====No impact to fairness – disparaties are inevitable, it~’s historically disproven, and self-correcting====

====Traditional debate isn~’t neutral – an appeal to fairness is the neoliberal myth that obscures massive violence====
**Žižek and Daly 4** (Slavoj, Prof. of European Graduate School, Intl. Director of the Birkbeck Inst. for Humanities, U. of London, and Senior Researcher @ Inst. of Sociology, U. of Ljubljiana, and Glyn, Professor Intl. Studies @ Northampton U., &amp;#34;Risking the Impossible&amp;#34; http://www.lacan.com/zizek-daly.htm)
This is not to endorse any kind of retrograde return to economism. Zizek~’s point 
AND
political boutiquism that is readily sustained by postmodern forms of consumerism and lifestyle.

====Limits are impossible====
**De Cock 1** (Christian De Cock, Professor of Organizational behaviour, change management, creative problem solving, 2001, &amp;#34;Of Philip K. Dick, reflexivity and shifting realities Organizing (writing) in our post-industrial society&amp;#34; in the book &amp;#34;Science Fiction and Organization&amp;#34;)
	
~’As Marx might have said more generally, ~’all that is built or all that 
AND
some hell to break loose~’ (McCloskey, 1994, p. 166). 

====Fairness is the myth of the neutral economy that creates structural inequality====
**Egnor 11** (Bill Egnor, contributor and assistant to the publisher at Firedoglake, Nov 28, 2011, &amp;#34;Occupy Wall St: It is All About Fairness, and that is the Strength of It&amp;#34;, http://www.dailykos.com/story/2011/11/28/1040453/-Occupy-Wall-St:-It-is-All-About-Fairness,-and-that-is-the-Strength-of-It)

America has a lot of national myths. In this we are not so different 
AND
and as such, if we work together, we can change things.


====Their move is not benign – the rhetoric of limits creates a necessarily exclusionary and authoritarian politics====
**Kulynych 97** (Kulynych, Assistant Professor of Political Science at Winthrop University, 1997 ~~Jessica, &amp;#34;Performing Politics,&amp;#34; Polity, Winter, v.XXX, n.2, p. 315-330)

II. Disciplining Habermas Political scientists have traditionally understood political participation as an activity that 
AND
problem is convincingly thematized is not just a matter of utilizing correct procedure. 

===2AC Ground===

====Begs the question of politics – if we win ecopedagogy is good then you should have predicted it====

====They can say, renewable energy bad, critical pedagogy bad, neolib good, and any number of kritiks – radical ecology faces a massive amount of criticism in the squo, and people generally seem to like things like the market – it~’s not like we didn~’t give you ground====

====Ground loss inevitable – there~’s a competitive advantage to race to the margins, policy debate incentivizes obscure disads====

===2AC Switch Side Debate===

====We meet – we don~’t mandate personal agreement, we just say ecopedagogy is a better method====

====Link turn – ecopedagogy key to contestation and democratic dissent – that~’s Kahn====

====Switch-side debate assumes a false subtraction from politics – Giroux says that disables activism====

====Their call for switch-side debate for decision-making skills mirrors the technique of the far-right – it occludes mass extinction of life====
**Kahn 10** (Richard Kahn, Assistant Professor of Educational Foundations and Research at the University of North Dakota, Critical Pedagogy, Ecoliteracy, %26 Planetary Crisis: The Ecopedagogy Movement, 2010, pp. 9-11)

Worse still, though, is that here environmental literacy has not only been co
AND
a number of theorists and educators who have sought to highlight their limitations.

===2AC Lundberg===

====Lundberg just says debate====

====Lundberg impact is backwards – we have to foreground a critique of social conditions that deliberation is constructed on to activate political agency====
**Edwards 13** (Jason Edwards, Lecturer in Politics, Programme Director BA Politics and Government at Birbeck University of London, 2013, &amp;#34;Play and Democracy: Huizinga and the Limits of Agonism,&amp;#34; Political Theory 41(1) 90–115, DOI: 10.1177/0090591712463200)

The idea that democracy is played as a form of life implies that what is 
AND
embeddedness of play—and culture—in social relations and material practices.


====They idealize debate – contestation does not automatically lead to democratic politics – social relations first====
**Edwards 13** (Jason Edwards, Lecturer in Politics, Programme Director BA Politics and Government at Birbeck University of London, 2013, &amp;#34;Play and Democracy: Huizinga and the Limits of Agonism,&amp;#34; Political Theory 41(1) 90–115, DOI: 10.1177/0090591712463200)

What a reading of Huizinga brings to light is the significance of the concept of 
AND
and a more critical understanding of the purpose and value of democratic contestation.

===2AC Hager===

====Hager = anticap anti-expert====
**Hager ~’7** (Carol, Assoc. Prof. of Political Science @ Bryn Mawr College, &amp;#34;Three Decades of Protest in Berlin Land-Use Planning, 1975-2005&amp;#34; German Studies Review 30, no. 1)
The West German postwar political consensus was shaken in the 1970s by a wave of 
AND
, and it sits uneasily with the government goal of increasing bureaucratic efficiency. 

====The Hager evidence is descriptive, assumes mobilization is already occurring. Aff can~’t explain the extrinsic motivation: Our critique is key====
**Hager ~’95** (Carol J., Assoc. Prof. of Political Science @ Bryn Mawr, &amp;#34;Democratizing Technology: Citizen %26 State in West German Energy Politics, 1974-1990&amp;#34; Polity, Vol. 25, No. 1, pp. 65-66)
Throughout the FRG, energy politics evolved in a similar fashion. As Habermas claimed
AND
dimension emerged as the more important and in many ways the more problematic.


====Calling debate~’s limits into question is key to deliberative democracy====
**Hager ~’95** (Carol J., Assoc. Prof. of Political Science @ Bryn Mawr, &amp;#34;Democratizing Technology: Citizen %26 State in West German Energy Politics, 1974-1990&amp;#34; Polity, Vol. 25, No. 1, pp. 69-70)
It is, however, the act of calling existing boundaries into question that keeps 
AND
continues for a space for a deliberative politics in modern technological society.61

====It~’s less difficult, to learn the technical skills – the ideological critique is key====
**Hager ~’95** (Carol J., Assoc. Prof. of Political Science @ Bryn Mawr, &amp;#34;Technical Debate in Administrative Court&amp;#34; Technological Democracy: Bureaucracy and Citizenry in the German Energy Debate, p. 209)
The case study reveals the energy problem to be less technical and more political than 
AND
goals and the self-understanding of a significant portion of the citizenry.


===2AC Education/Policymaking===

====Link turn – politics is dead, that~’s above – ecopedagogy is the only way to politicize debate and mobilize us as intellectuals and activists====

====Fetishizing instrumental education kills resistance to neoliberal ideology====
**Giroux 11** (Henry A. Giroux, Global TV Network Chair in English and Cultural Studies at McMaster University, 28 February 2011, &amp;#34;Left Behind? American Youth and the Global Fight for Democracy&amp;#34;, http://www.truth-out.org/left-behind-american-youth-and-global-fight-democracy68042)
	
Meanwhile, not only have academic jobs been disappearing, but given the shift to 
AND
funded, knowledge has to justify itself in market terms or simply perish.

====They spatialize the political – imagining the debate space as abstracted from the political destroys the potential for change and confines us to ivory tower politics – that~’s Giroux====

====Focusing on the levers of power cedes politics to warmongers====
**Kappeler**, Freelance author and teacher in England and Germany, **1995** ~~Susanne, The Will to Violence: the Politics of Personal Behavior, p. 9-11~~

War does not suddenly break out in a peaceful society; sexual violence is not 
AND
and that there is no such thing as not acting or doing nothing.
Traditional conceptions of government fiat are fiction—they misrepresent the process of government decisionmaking, and are neither educational nor predictable
**Claude 1988** (Inis, Professor of Government and Foreign Affairs, University of Virginia, States and the Global System, pages 18-20)
This view of the state as an institutional monolith is fostered by the notion of 
AND
and discipline that theory attributes to them–and that they sometimes claim.

====This is especially true in policy debate====
**Mitchell**, Ass~’t. Prof. of Communications at Pittsburgh, **1998 **~~Gordon, &amp;#34;Pedagogical Possibilities for Argumentative Agency in Academic Debate,&amp;#34; Argumentation and Advocacy, Fall, ProQuest~~
The sense of detachment associated with the spectator posture is highlighted during episodes of alienation 
AND
in the drama of political life&amp;#34; (1991, p. 8). 
~~He Continues...~~	
The sense of argumentative agency produced through action research is different in kind from those 
AND
change, because the point of reference for experiencing the landscape shifts fundamentally.


===Presumption Can~’t Test===

====Presumes a relation to truth we~’ve impact turned====

====Inherently conservative====

The current crisis has shaken neoliberal economics at the core – the status quo leads to system-wide collapse and extinction
Öniş and Güven 11 (Ziya Öniş is professor of international relations and director of the Center for Research on Globalization and Democratic Governance (GLODEM) at Koç University.

This article highlights the major elements of rupture and continuity . . .  UK are being forced back to the drawing board.
Harms

Neoliberal governmentality ensures war, disease, and environmental collapse- economic decision-making views people as a disposable resource for producing capital, only stepping outside this frame for politics can avert extinction
Giroux 6 (Henry A. Giroux currently holds the Global TV Network Chair Professorship at McMaster University in Canada.  “Dirty Democracy and State Terrorism: The Politics of the New Authoritarianism in the United States,” Comparative Studies of South Asia, Africa and the Middle East 26.2 (2006) 163-177.)
While it would be ludicrous to suggest that the United States either represents a mirror . . .  the 1990s alone, war forced 20 million children to leave their homes.16  

The market is merely a vehicle for corporate control and first world consolidation of resources – their claims that the market promotes freedom ignore the billions across the globe trapped in abject poverty

Hegemony only exists in Kagan’s mind – system is de-centralized, applying hegemonic mythology to policy causes blowback and destroys cooperation
Doran 9 (Charles F., Andrew W. Mellon Prof. of International Relations, Director of the Global Theory and History Program, Director of the Center for Canadian Studies @ Johns Hopkins U., “Fooling Oneself: The Mythology of Hegemony” International Studies Review, Vol. 11.1)

More than a catalogue of techniques other governments use to . . .  to be self-financing, self-enforcing, and self-sufficient.

Heg unsustainable
Layne 4/25 (Christopher Layne, professor and Robert M. Gates Chair in National Security at Texas A and M University’s George H. W. Bush School of Government and Public Service, “The Global Power Shift from West to East,” 4/25/12) http://nationalinterest.org/article/the-global-power-shift-west-east-6796?page=show

This does not mean the United States will go the way of Great Britain during the first half of the . . .  to privilege American interests, norms and values.

Hegemony is a paranoid fantasy~-~--the most secure nation on earth sees threats to empire everywhere, which legitimizes constant violence~-~--you have an obligation to place the structural violence that hegemony invisibilizes at the core of your decision calculus 
McClintock 9—chaired prof of English and Women’s and Gender Studies at UW–Madison. MPhil from Cambridge; PhD from Columbia (Anne, Paranoid Empire: Specters from Guantánamo and Abu Ghraib, Small Axe Mar2009, Issue 28, p50-74)

By now it is fair to say that the United States has come to be dominated . . . will henceforth be known as the age of terrorism.” 13

Violent isn’t down in the status quo. We control the internal-link to every form of violence
Parr ’13 (Adrian, Assoc. Prof. of Philosophy and Environmental Studies @ U. of Cincinnati, THE WRATH OF CAPITAL: Neoliberalism and Climate Change Politics, pp. 145-147)
A quick snapshot of the twenty-first century so . . .  from the point that after 2050 it may all be over.

Pinker thinks hegemonic stability theory is bullshit. Also DPT wrong.
Pinker 11 (Steven Pinker, Johnstone Family Professor in the Department of Psychology at Harvard University, 2011, “The Long Peace” in The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined, Pub. Penguin Press)

In fact, the Democratic Peace theory did even better than its advocates . . .. To understand the Long Peace, we have to pry these influences apart.

Even if its theoretically sustainable – our politics is so messed up it doesn’t matter

He is especially interested in the relation of literature to philosophy.)
