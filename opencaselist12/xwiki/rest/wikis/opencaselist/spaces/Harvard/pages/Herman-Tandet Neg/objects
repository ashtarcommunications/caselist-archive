Welcome to an edgy world … in our resource-constrained world.
Take the Strait of Hormuz, already making headlines and shaking energy markets as 2012 begins. Connecting the Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean, it lacks imposing geographical features like the Rock of Gibraltar or the Golden Gate Bridge. In an energy-conscious world, however, it may possess greater strategic significance than any passageway on the planet. Every day, according to the U.S. Department of Energy, tankers carrying some 17 million barrels of oil — representing 20 percent of the world’s daily supply — pass through this vital artery.
So last month, when a senior Iranian official threatened to block the strait in response to Washington’s tough new economic sanctions, oil prices instantly soared. While the U.S. military has vowed to keep the strait open, doubts about the safety of future oil shipments and worries about a potentially unending, nerve-jangling crisis involving Washington, Tehran and Tel Aviv have energy experts predicting high oil prices for months to come, meaning further woes for a slowing global economy.
The Strait of Hormuz is, however, … to fight in such locales.

(v) Shifting the onus of proof. In the case cited above, the precautionary principle suggests that the burden of proof could shift onto the proto- developer to show ‘no reasonable environmental harm’ to such sites or processes, before development of any kind could proceed. This is the reversal of the normal position where it is up to the opponents of development to show likely and unreasonable harm (Cameron and Wade-Gery, 1992). Such a reversal of the liability rule would be truly radical and difficult to implement since it would involve some definition of ‘harmfulness’ (or if the burden is to be reversed completely, some measure of ‘harmlessness’). In effect such an arrangement would mean imposing a ‘duty of environmental care’ on all developers, as proposed by Costanza and Cowell (1992).

The 1ac’s call for further energy production amounts to a marketing plow designed to ensure that social libidinal energies remain firmly driven towards consumption. This reduces the world to a series of objects and reifies a modern subject devoid of care, causing extinction
Stiegler ‘12 (Bernard, is Director of the Institut de recherché et d’innovation (IRI) and founder of Ars Industrialis and the Ecole de Philosophe d’Epineuil-le-Fleuriel. “Care: Within the limits of Capitalism, economizing means taking care” Telemorphosis: Theory in the Era of Climate Change Vol 1., Online)

Capitalism reduces reality to crude economism – this instrumentality precludes ethics and results in inevitable environmental destruction

Now none of these philosophers are naïve … will ethics have a seat at the table.

The alternative is to refuse institutional tinkering in favor of reinvesting decision-making with care – our act of criticism reveals this debate represents a choice—reinscribing decision-making with care is a prerequisite to challenging the drive to consume and trend toward individuation that is preventing the Left from thinking a challenge to the mis-growth of capitalism
Barker ‘9 (Stephen, Professor and Head of Doctoral Studies at The Claire Trevor School of the Arts, University of California at Irvine. “Transformation as an ontological Imperative: The Human Future according to Bernard Stiegler”, Transformations, http://www.transformationsjournal.org/journal/issue_17/article_01.shtml)

Technics and dis-individuation pre-determine our relation to temporality itself, which makes re-thinking the libidinal economy a prerequisite to both their predictions and calculations

The question of what allows … outset circumvented the true problem.

We control the internal link to escalation, replacement of rational cognition with corporate drive is what causes people to act irrationally and then rationalize it after the fact.

2NC – Alternative

Only a reinvocation of care within our libidinal economy can challenge modern capitalism’s drive towards consumption

The issue is an urgent … rather than the private derrick.

Care is an axiom, not an add-on. Technology controls the imagination and produces an ontological alienation which prevents collective action

The 1AC continues a logic of containment that has defined American life since Hiroshima: fear of the bomb has transformed into an appear to state power in an effort to convert the atom into a manageable entity.

The atom bomb has become … the brink of self-destruction.
Exuberant or ghastly, nuclear exceptionalism was full of contradictions. For all the efforts at making nuclear things exceptional, there were opposing attempts to render them banal. Government propagandists assured citizens that simple gestures offered protection if the bombs did fall. American schoolchildren could take refuge under their desks, sang Bert the Turtle in the famous “Duck and Cover” ditty. Fallout shelters promised the perpetuation of suburban lifestyles in the event of nuclear war. The hyper-organized Swiss went so far as to pass building codes requiring fallout shelters. In the late 1970s, as a teenager, I lived in the suburbs of Zurich. My parents ignored the basement shelter, with its massive lead-lined door, leaving it devoid of the canned goods and blankets prescribed for nuclear survival. Secretly I feared the place. How and what would we breathe if the bombs fell?
The spread of commercial nuclear … followed not in the technology.

Modern eco-politics is simulative – attempts to achieve sustainability are trapped in a politics of performance that makes piecemeal reforms while obscuring the root cause of environmental destruction – the 1AC presents a real problem but frames the answer as a CONSUMER CHOICE between different ENERGY PRODUCTS – these demands generate a cycle of self-referentiality that forecloses real solutions

Environmental politics is first and foremost a communicative act – despite the need for policies that engage with physical realities, the path to those politics is always semiotically mediated by socio-cultural norms of expectation and acceptability – plan focus and judge choice are illogical and anti-academic – both assume that the plan is an objective reality we can all access in the same way using the same set of normative values.

====Indigenous ways of knowing the world do not exist as a monolithic cultural artifact to be endorsed or learned – the mythologization of indigenous culture is a symbolic expression of postcolonial guilt that merely smothers indigenous agency in the present.===
Cowlishaw 11 – (Aug. 2011, Gillian, PhD, professor of anthropology, University of Sydney, &amp;#34;Mythologising culture: Part 2: Disturbing aboriginality in the suburbs,&amp;#34; The Australian Journal of Anthropology Volume 22, Issue 2, pages 170–188, August 2011, wiley)

As shown earlier, there are varied responses to the ways Aboriginal culture is being 
AND
skinned and takes pride in a stylish appearance and dramatic, emphatic ideas:
I~’m a descendent of the tribal people, from the central West … That~’s all I need to know. I don~’t need to walk around with war paint on, with the Aboriginal flag advertising who I am. Because I~’ve got an education I can survive in the white man~’s world. If you want to learn the lingo you can learn that, but that~’s up to you.
They keep saying, we got to get our culture back and that~’ll save us. It won~’t save us. We can have all the culture in the world, but because we haven~’t got the daily basic living skills, that~’s where we~’re going backwards.
The whole key is education, cause if not, in another 200 years, the only blackfellas that~’ll be alive are the educated ones. … Capitalism won~’t stop and wait for you. ~’Hey catch up to us Jack.~’ It~’ll just keep going. And that~’s the way of the world. (see also Cowlishaw 2009)27
Barney~’s view that ~’culture won~’t save us~’ directly contradicts the frequent claims that culture 
AND
cultural recognition and revival is to do with the surfaces of social life.
Of course, none of us has the culture of our ancestors. The loss 
AND
, yet it is assumed that disenchanted Aboriginal youth will value Aboriginal culture.
Among the developments in post-colonial studies of the 1970s was a rejection of 
AND
; cultural renewal is deployed as a remedy for the way people live.
The Indigenous mythopoeia is a part of the nation~’s aspirations to be post-colonial
AND
the Indigenous people of Australia, with all the baggage that depiction carries.
Anthropology and Aboriginal Culture
My final observation is about the relationship between anthropology and the current ~’sentimental politics~’ 
AND
the expense of some more than of others~’ (Dombrowski 2001: 184).
Northern or remote Aborigines are assumed to be less burdened by cultural loss and engagement 
AND
, that continue to disrupt, divide and confuse Aboriginal self-fashioning.
The Australian mythopoeia is a form of nativism, where Aboriginal people~’s sense of who 
AND
: 240). Such conditions for the Indigenous Australian subject are barely imaginable.

====The concept of indigeneity itself is problematic – the attribution of an environmental worldview to indigenous culture ignores internal differences and hierarchies in favor of a romanticized colonial image of indigenous people====
Lewallen 03 – (2003, Ann-Elise, PhD, assistant professor of Modern Japanese Cultural Studies, University of California, Santa Barbara, &amp;#34;Strategic &amp;#34;Indigeneity&amp;#34; and the Possibility of a Global Indigenous Women~’s Movement,&amp;#34; Michigan Feminist Studies, vol. 17, 2003, Issue title: Gender and Globalisms, http://hdl.handle.net/2027/spo.ark5583.0017.005)

Guerrero has defined indigenism as part and parcel of an indigenous worldview. According to

Herein, according to Pillai, lies the critical distinction between indigenous and third world 
AND
the theoretical utility of these categories as tools for analysis of social processes.

====The aff~’s post-colonial nostalgia is not harmless but rather represents the intrusion of colonialism into the present – longing for the exotic is simultaneously longing to tame the exotic, justifying otherization and violence.====
Gregory 04 – (2004, Derek, professor of geography, University of British Columbia, &amp;#34;The Colonial Present: Afghanistan, Palestine, Iraq,&amp;#34; google books)

On the other side, there is often nostalgia for the cultures that colonial modernity 
AND
&amp;#34;civilization&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;barbarism,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Good&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Evil&amp;#34;?

====The discursive legacy of colonialism makes violence and genocide inevitable ====
Schwab 06 – (2006, Gabriele, &amp;#34;Writing against memory and forgetting&amp;#34; Literature and Medicine, Volume 25, Number 1, Spring 2006, pp. 95-121)

Human beings have always silenced violent histories. Some histories, collective and personal, 
AND
and reparation. Many theories, including psychoanalysis, concur with this assumption. 

====The role of the ballot is to perform a counter-nostalgic reading of the aff – there is no such thing as a single indigenous epistemology that can be isolated, examined, studied, and endorsed – rather than a romanticised and over-simplified nostalgia of indigenous epistemology, you should problematize static understandings of the messy realities of history. ====
Ladino 04 – (2004, Jennifer, doctoral candidate in English at the University of Washington (at time of publication), currently Assistant Professor of English, Director of Undergraduate Studies, University of Idaho, &amp;#34;Longing for Wonderland: Nostalgia for Nature in Post-Frontier America,&amp;#34; Iowa Journal of Cultural Studies 5 (Fall 2004), http://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1118%26context=ijcs)

===2NC – Overview===

====Framing issue – it doesn’t matter whether the aff attempts to use romanticized histories for good or whether those historical readings are positive – the LONG TERM outcome of such a strategy is the VIOLENT EXCLUSION of those who do not fit the prevalent indigenous stereotype, creating an EXISTENTIAL THREAT to indigneous cultural identity.====
Waldron and Newton 12 – (Nov. 2012, David, PhD, lecturer in history and anthropology, University of Ballarat, and Janice, PhD, Adjunct Senior Researcher/Lecturer in Social Sciences at the University of Ballarat, &amp;#34;Rethinking Appropriation of the Indigenous: A Critique of the Romanticist Approach,&amp;#34; Nova Religio: The Journal of Alternative and Emergent Religions, Vol. 16, No. 2 (November 2012), pp. 64-85, jstor)
	
In this sense, it matters little that romanticized images of Aboriginal cultures are almost invariably positive. At the very least, the romanticized image invariably de-politicizes Indigenous identity and reconfigures it as legitimate only within the stereotyped construction of the dominant culture episteme. The &amp;#34;public valorisation of Indigenous people and culture (is) at odds with their mundane marginal position.&amp;#34; 39 Cognizance of this is a starting point for real understanding.
The issues of cultural representation and ownership are intrinsically interwoven with the struggles of Aboriginal peoples to have their voices heard and their interests recognized and accepted by government, industry and mainstream culture. As Aboriginal lawyer Larissa Behrendt argues,
The long-term outcomes for rights protections based on the assertion of noble savage
AND
as a result the issue of rights is relegated to the sidelines. 40
The struggle to maintain appropriate channels of authority, in the face of destabilizing Anglo
AND
no longer organized around classical pre-contact kinship and religious tenets. 41

====The nostalgic desire for tradition and return results in scapegoating and genocide – makes catastrophic violence inevitable====
Boym 01 – (2001, Svetlana, prof of comparative and Slavic literature at Harvard, The Future of Nostalgia, p. 43)

To conspire means literally to breath together—but usually this collective breath doesn~’t smell 
AND
operated in response to conspiracy theories in the name of a restored homeland.


===2NC – THE FACTS===

Similar to the concept of indigeneity, indigenous knowledge soon became the subject of a wide-ranging critique. In a pioneering and inﬂuential analysis, Agrawal (1995, p. 422) writes
Certainly, what is today known and classiﬁed as indigenous knowledge has been in intimate interaction with western knowledge since at least the ﬁfteenth century. In the face of evidence that suggests contact, variation, transformation, exchange, communication, and learning over the last several centuries, it is difﬁcult to adhere to a view of indigenous and western forms of knowledge being untouched by each other.

====c) indigenous culture – it doesn~’t exist – any attempt to return to or valorize a particular cultural worldview ignores the constant change and exchange taking place within and between cultures – some were nomadic, some were agricultural, some were authoritarian, some were democratic, some were matriarchal, some were horribly misogynist.====

*IWLN = Indigenous ways of living in nature; WS = Western science; ES = Eurocentric sciences; TNK = Traditional native knowledge

The cultural context for the scheme has been skewed; only Native knowledge is deemed 
AND
However, more than pertinent labels are required for an appropriate cultural context.
Second, an authentic cultural context for an improved scheme would explicitly deal with problems 
AND
Table 1 conveys a Eurocentric image of what can be learned from nature.
Third, statements (e.g., ~’~’applied~’~’ to real life) in the TKN column of the scheme treat Elders~’ wisdom as a commodity decontextualized from life and its web of relationships. Wisdom is real life in an Indigenous monist, holistic, relational worldview; it does not get applied to real life. The issue raised here is not one of semantics; it is one of how to build strong bridges across the fallacy of binary opposites (Battiste 2002).
Fourth, an authentic cultural context recognizes the dynamic and contemporary nature of IWLN, 
AND
comparisons between IWLN and ES in a science education context (Ninnes 2000).
Fifth, a false dichotomy seems evident in Table 1 within the theme ~’~’habits 
AND
wisdom~’~’ in the TNK column, and ~’~’skepticism~’~’ in the WS column.
Sixth, the statement ~’~’trust for inherited wisdom~’~’ relates to content validity in IWLN 
AND
appearing in different themes, and by statements whose cultural signiﬁcance seems lost.
Seventh, the WS column in Table 1 gives no hint of the great heterogeneity found in the Eurocentric sciences. Instead, it offers a universalist characterization that inherently supports a hegemonic discourse, because IWLN tend to be marginalized or discounted when compared to a universalist position. A pluralist heterogeneous perspective on ES enhances a postcolonial discourse.z</headline></objectSummary><objectSummary><link rel="http://www.xwiki.org/rel/object" href="http://opencaselist.paperlessdebate.com/xwiki/rest/wikis/opencaselist/spaces/Harvard/pages/Herman-Tandet%20Neg/objects/Admin.EntryClass/47"/><link rel="http://www.xwiki.org/rel/properties" href="http://opencaselist.paperlessdebate.com/xwiki/rest/wikis/opencaselist/spaces/Harvard/pages/Herman-Tandet%20Neg/objects/Admin.EntryClass/47/properties"/><id>opencaselist:Harvard.Herman-Tandet Neg:7cd0e98e-45ef-4544-88f2-5f62c7f27e26</id><guid>7cd0e98e-45ef-4544-88f2-5f62c7f27e26</guid><pageId>opencaselist:Harvard.Herman-Tandet Neg</pageId><wiki>opencaselist</wiki><space>Harvard</space><pageName>Herman-Tandet Neg</pageName><className>Admin.EntryClass</className><number>47</number><headline>==1NC==

====THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS NATURE – affirmative’s MONONATURALISM is built on romanticization of pre-modern cultural forms that posits the invincible laws of nature in order to insulate its political choices from all criticism====

The Fragile Aid of Comparative Anthropology
Political ecology has finally taken the drama out of the perennial conflict between nature and 
AND
was taken a bit too hastily as if it were all there is.&amp;#34;

====Renewables are the new casinos – they’re just systems of power that lock in certain modes of subjectivity – they lock tribes into new dependence, don’t usher in a new radical politics  ====
**Vizenor ~’9** (Gerald, Distingished Prof. of American Studies @ U. of New Mexico, Prof. Emeritus, U. of California, Berkeley, Native Liberty: Natural Reason and Cultural Survivance, pp. 121-124)
Indian casino regimes could have considered a more impressive demonstration of sovereignty, an investment 
AND
honored for more than a century in treaties with the federal government.&amp;#34;34
Truth Games
The United States Constitution is a truth game inspired by a revolution, and yet that exemplary constitution was used to exclude natives who had resisted colonial and frontier dominion. Slavery, the cruelties of colonial empires and imperial frontier justice were the lies of civilization and denied native cultural hybridity and liberty. The notions of global empire sovereignty, however, are the new truth games of native traditions, casinos, constitutions, and economic globalization.
Native Americans have been the subject of empire and mission lies from the first instance of contact and the conceits of discovery. Europeans, by word and image, created simulations of natives in the cultural binaries of savagism and civilization. The first pervasive lie of discovery was the invention of the indian, and that monotheistic lie has been compounded in truth games as a singular name for thousands of distinct native cultures.
These rather obvious points are made to connect the practice of colonial deception and the promise of moral games of truth with the constitutional renunciation of native rights on the hybrid frontier of the United States of America.
The American Indian is a brand culture, a dubious, customary simulation of distinct 
AND
commercial truth game, and without a trace of resistance or apparent irony.
Mark Taylor noted in The Moment of Complexity that our &amp;#34;extraordinary complexity&amp;#34; in the modern world has exhausted the strategies to interpret experience. There is a &amp;#34;widespread consensus that the most pressing critical challenge is to find ways to resist systems and structures that totalize by repressing otherness and by reducing differences to same.&amp;#34;
These &amp;#34;hegemonic structures,&amp;#34; he pointed out, &amp;#34;must be 123 subverted or overturned by soliciting the return of repressed otherness and differences in a variety of guises.&amp;#34;35
Indian casinos are strategies of survivance, an incredible subversion of &amp;#34;hegemonic structures,&amp;#34; but avarice is an odious disguise, and with no manner or remorse for the repression of native ethics and liberty. The mercenary sovereignty and politics of casino money is a truth game that might overturn the honor and assurance of native transmotion and visionary sovereignty.
States, cities, companies, and now reservations, are concerned about brand recognition. &amp;#34;The unbranded state has a difficult time attracting economic and political attention. Image and reputation are thus becoming essential parts of the state~’s strategic equity,&amp;#34; wrote Peter van Ham in ForeignAffairs.&amp;#34; Although no doubt unsettling to conservative thinkers, this is actually a positive development, since state branding is gradually supplanting nationalism.&amp;#34;36
Indian casinos dare not invite revisions of brand simulations of natives because the truism of gaming rights on treaty reservations could be abrogated by the plenary power doctrine of the United States Congress. In other words, the money comes by the historical contradictions of brand name simulations and the federal exclaves of nationalism. Casinos have contrived new fugitives of dominance in a truth game of sovereignty.
Convictions, on the other hand, &amp;#34;are more dangerous enemies of truth than lies,&amp;#34; asserted Friedrich Nietzsche in Human, All Too Human. He pointed out that &amp;#34;lying demands invention, dissimulation, and good memory&amp;#34; and mused that the &amp;#34;beast in us wants to be lied to; morality is an official lie told so that it shall not tear us to pieces.&amp;#34;37
Natives might have shared the view that moral convictions on the frontier were dangerous, but surely not more treacherous than the denial of human rights on the continent. Natives who lost their transmotion and liberty on the frontier were doubly tormented by monotheistic convictions and the truth games of the United States Constitution.
&amp;#34;Everyday life contains many truth games,&amp;#34; wrote John Forrester in Truth Games. &amp;#34;The social processes and institutions that establish power, expertise, and authority also generate truths,&amp;#34; and the games of truth. &amp;#34;From the sheer diversity, resilience, and efficiency of the thousands of languages people use, it is clear that language has very little to do with truth.&amp;#34;
Moreover, lying &amp;#34;is always distinguished from error or falsity by its deliberateness,&amp;#34; 
AND
dynamics of all such mirroring encounters with the other, the native.&amp;#34;38
Natives are the subject of incessant, duplicitous truth games, the scientific, linguistic, ethnographic, and institutional objects of knowledge and political power. Natives, once a hybrid presence in the hemisphere, have become the absent object of various truth games, the fugitives of simulations, and the romantic promise of absence and eternal exile. 125 National covenants and the truth games of institutions proscribed a native presence as brand cultures on the continent.
The conception of truth games was derived from the original philosophical ideas of Michel Foucault 
AND
can put themselves in place and be linked to relationships of power.&amp;#34;39
Foucault raised three &amp;#34;traditional problems&amp;#34; of humanism, ethics, and models of freedom, in Technologies of the Self. First, what are the &amp;#34;relations we have to truth through scientific knowledge, to those ~’truth games~’ which are so important in civilization and in which we are both subject and object?&amp;#34; Second, what are the &amp;#34;relationships we have to others through those strange strategies and power relationships?&amp;#34; Third, what are the &amp;#34;relationships between truth, power, and self?&amp;#34;40

====The sudden discovery of tribal heritage is not the passport to knowledge that the 1AC claims – the &amp;#34;Indian Badge&amp;#34; is part and parcel of a commodification and academicization of tribal life that obscures the actual survivance of indigenous and causes its own form of amnesia====
**Vizenor ~’94** (Gerald, Distingished Prof. of American Studies @ U. of New Mexico, Prof. Emeritus, U. of California, Berkeley, Manifest Manners, pp. 60-62)
The concerted creations of tribal cultures are in continuous translations as stories, and the situation of hermeneutics remains the same in simulations; the silence of heard stories in translations, and the absence of the heard, antecedes a presence in the shadows of names.
Has the absence of the heard in tribal stories turned to the literatures of dominance? What are the real names, nouns, and pronouns heard in the fields of tribal consciousness? How can a pronoun be a source of tribal identities in translation? How can a pronoun be essential, an inscription of absence that represents the presence of sound and a person in translation?  
Hertha Dawn Wong declared an obscure connection to tribal identities in the preface to Sending

~~MARKED HERE~~

, one of the unidentified mixed-bloods whose forebears wandered away from their fractured communities, leaving little cultural trace in their adopted world.&amp;#34; The racialism of these romantic notions would bear minimal honor in tribal memories.
Elizabeth Cook-Lynn, editor of Wicazo Sa Review, argued that the &amp;#34;
AND
of some scholars, however, are not even a little bit tribal.
Jack Anderson, in a column released by the Universal Press Syndicate in 1984, 
AND
Jr. and Hank Adams say flatly that Highwater is not an Indian.&amp;#34;
Highwater, author of The Primal Mind and other books about tribal cultures, may 
AND
not feel guilty if we are among those who have managed to survive.&amp;#34;
Highwater insinuated six years earlier that he was of tribal descent. &amp;#34;As Indians
AND
is dishonorable; the course of manifest manners and the literature of dominance.
Anthony Kerby argued in Narrative and the Self that the loss of the &amp;#34;ability 
AND
past we understand ourselves to be the implied subject generated by the narrative.&amp;#34;
In other words, tribal identities are heard in names and stories; otherwise the simulations that antecede tribal stories and tragic wisdom would be tantamount to amnesia and the discoveries of tribal cultures in the literatures of dominance.

No impact to waste
Lovelock 04 (James, University of Oxford, “ Nuclear Power is the Only Green Solution”, Independent, 5/24)

The one remaining trumped-up nuclear issue, is to do with the mythology surrounding nuclear wastes and waste disposal and long term health concerns. There are even a few who believe that the nuclear waste issue is so unsolved, that we should not build any new nuclear plants until we solve this problem – as though the problem actually exists in reality rather than just politically.
Most of what we hear in the media about nuclear wastes is wrong, with minor glimmers of truth. It is intended to be frightening. Even the Yucca site is merely a political sideshow for Nevada politicians and others, to posture and grandstand. The issue, as it is dealt with by the media and Special Interest Factions, is totally devoid of perspective and the necessary epidemiological data to place it in any ranking of comparable social risks. Such data exist, even on this site, but are studiously and strenuously ignored by these critics. We continually hear other such emotionally loaded statements that spent fuel, the most highly radioactive ‘nuclear waste’ and its disposal is: 1 An unsolved problem 2. Dangerously radioactive for millions of years 3. A threat to the health of future generations 4. A proliferation threat 5. A terrorist target
That none of these statements is true, though one of them does have a 
AND
noise, and a great deal of emotional misinformation, but little substance.


Waste is easy to deal with

Ferguson,  president of the Federation of American Scientists, project director of the Independent Task Force on U.S. Nuclear Weapons Policy at CFR,  djunct professor in the security studies program at Georgetown University, “Think Again: Nuclear Power,” Nov 2011) http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/10/11/think_again_nuclear_power?page=full

Fast awrming and biodiveristy loss are coming now and outweigh the aff – any wars will be contained by rational actors and are unlikely to cause extinction – climate forcing and positive feedbacks ensure warming is irreversible once we pass the threshold – barry and roberts evidence indicates that rapid deindustrialization and collapse of growth in the short term is the only way to achieve a sufficient reduction in ghg emissions to avoid the point of no return
