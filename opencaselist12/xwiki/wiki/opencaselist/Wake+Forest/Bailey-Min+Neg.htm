The strategy appears to acknowledge this connection and commit to remedy it.<br/>• The most assertive passages of the statement are moderated with community-building intent<br/>AND<br/>United States is a party, and the inherent right of self defense.”<br/>• The concluding and most conflict-oriented section of the strategy opens by noting <br/>AND<br/>, however, call for maintaining options to develop complementary space conflict capabilities.<br/>Rather, the strategy asserts that the U.S. “must be prepared to ‘fight through’ a degraded environment,” and identifies “resilience” and “space protection” as the key criteria.<br/>The preceding survey of elements of the 2011 National Security Space Strategy is deliberately selective<br/>AND<br/>years after Donald Rumsfeld’s notorious warning of a “space Pearl Harbor.”11 &nbsp;<br/>The most immediate significance of the National Security Space Strategy is likely the signals its <br/>AND<br/>over its provisions and its relationship to the Outer Space Treaty have intensified. &nbsp;<br/>These policy movements toward multilateral engagement and commitment to behavioral standards (even if non<br/>AND<br/>greater international cooperation, but the terms of the debate remain the same.<br/>In sum, the National Security Space Strategy appears to mark not only a swing <br/>AND<br/>remain to be developed.18 Many devils may lurk in these details.&nbsp;</p><p>The plan is perceived as weaponization <br/>Pop, 2k – PhD Student, University of Glasgow Law School (Virgiliu, “SECURITY IMPLICATIONS OF NON-TERRESTRIAL RESOURCE EXPLOITATION”, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../www.geocities.com/virgiliu_pop/publications/security.pdf)" tppabs="http://www.geocities.com/virgiliu_pop/publications/security.pdf)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.geocities.com/virgiliu_pop/publications/security.pdf)</span></a></span><br/>The SPS system, although not directly aimed at countering strategic ballistic missiles, might <br/>AND<br/>Use of the SPS for ABM purposes would hence be banned”24.&nbsp;</p><p>Nuclear war<br/>Hitchens, 8 – president of the Center for Defense Information (Theresa, “Space Wars - Coming to the Sky Near You?”, Scientific American, February, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../www.sciam.com/article.cfm-id=space-wars-coming-to-the-sky-near-you)" tppabs="http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=space-wars-coming-to-the-sky-near-you)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=space-wars-coming-to-the-sky-near-you)</span></a></span></p><p>Perhaps of even greater concern is that several other nations, including one of China’s regional rivals, India, may feel compelled to seek ¬offensive as well as defensive capabilities in space. The U.S. trade journal Defense News, for instance, quoted unidentified Indian defense officials as stating that their country had already begun developing its own kinetic-energy (nonexplosive, hit-to-kill) and laser-based antisatellite weapons.<br/>If India goes down that path, its archrival Pakistan will probably follow suit. Like India, Pakistan has a well-developed ballistic missile program, including medium-range missiles that could launch an antisatellite system. Even Japan, the third major Asian power, might join such a space race. In June 2007 the National Diet of Japan began considering a bill backed by the current Fukuda government that would permit the development of satellites for “military and national security” purposes.<br/>As for Russia, in the wake of the Chinese test President Vladimir Putin reiterated <br/>AND<br/>would be hard-pressed to forgo entering an arms race in space.<br/>Given the proliferation of spacefaring entities, proponents of a robust space warfare strategy believe that arming the heavens is inevitable and that it would be best for the U.S. to get there first with firepower. Antisatellite and space-based weapons, they argue, will be necessary not only to defend U.S. military and commercial satellites but also to deny any future adversary the use of space capabilities to enhance the performance of its forces on the battlefield.<br/>Yet any arms race in space would almost inevitably destabilize the balance of power and <br/>AND<br/>reliably distinguishing an intentional act from an accidental one would be highly problematic.<br/>Hit-to-Kill Interceptors According to assessments by U.S. military <br/>AND<br/>lasted half a century.

SBSP systems <br/>AND<br/>military application scenarios from the report are outlined and summarized in Table 1.<br/>Forward Operating Base Power<br/>A Forward Operating Base (FOB) exists to support a small number of reconnaissance and surveillance teams as well as for military power projection ahead of primary forces. As such, the FOB can be anywhere from 50 to 5,000 personnel because it is task-organized and scales accordingly.<br/>Provision of electrical energy to the FOB must be viewed as a necessary commodity. The FOBs tend to be in remote, relatively inaccessible areas, due to both terrain and location of opposing forces (OPFOR). Resupply missions are tradeoffs between the risk of sending in an armed convoy and the risk, and substantial additional costs, of air resupply.<br/>With basic assumptions of 1-3 kW/person at the FOB, generator <br/>AND<br/>temporarily powering the UOC, but it is inadequate for any larger installation.<br/>Currently, sets of semi-permanent generators are used set some distance away from the Command Operations Center (COC) in order to provide both thermal and noise abatement. Fuel and ammunition (designated the Forward Ammunition and Refueling Point FARP) are likewise separated from the COC and living spaces for safety reasons.<br/>Could SBSP credibly provide power to the FOB? Any replacement for the generators would <br/>AND<br/>surrounding countryside would likely also benefit from the power transfer – OPFOR included.<br/>The size of the base in question is a critical factor. For microwave power <br/>AND<br/>posts, and supply depots may or may not be supportable with SBSP.<br/>A point that needs to be clarified is the ultimate purpose of the power delivery<br/>AND<br/>must be stored for later delivery by another method. Some possible contexts:<br/>Stationary facilities with large amounts of available real-estate – provide large amounts of continuous power to larger facilities. This scenario starts to look and feel like the power grid-type application that is typically posed for SBSP.<br/>Direct delivery to a power storage/conversion facility – charge batteries or convert into other energystorage paradigms (fuels, stored mechanical potential energy, etc.).<br/>Either contextual application is more suitable for a fairly secure area, relatively far away from any action. While potentially extremely useful to the personnel in action, the implementation is very different, and would seem to stretch the definition of “tactical”.<br/>Millimeter-wave or laser delivery systems offer possible advantages as the decrease in wavelength <br/>AND<br/>of aircraft and vehicle fuel required by such installations (Johnson, 2008).<br/>Power to Individual End Users<br/>The prospect of reducing the need for soldiers and other users to carry numerous and <br/>AND<br/>to displace the need for them by providing power directly to the soldier.<br/>Direct SBSP power delivery to daily patrols, either individuals or vehicles, seems problematic <br/>AND<br/>(about 1 W per sq ft) above 1.5 GHz. <br/>Examples of end user consumption:<br/>Radio transmitter: Considerable power needs to be available, for example, to operate a radio – 10’s to 100’s of Watts while transmitting.<br/>Vehicle operation: A typical car only requires 10’s of horsepower to travel at reasonable speeds on a highway (much more when accelerating or traversing rough terrain). 1 HP is approximately 750 Watts, so even a 10 or 20 HP requirement becomes a requirement for 7.5 to 15 kW of power, even before considering the conversion efficiency between electrical and mechanical energy.<br/>The preferred application of power to these problems would require the ability to directly beam energy to each recipient rather than blanketing the area for several reasons:<br/>Only the people / vehicles need the power – a tremendous fraction of power is wasted if it is transmitted everywhere.<br/>Transmitting power everywhere is like providing a natural resource – one’s enemies can also use it, greatly reducing the advantage one gains by developing and implementing the system<br/>At radio frequency (RF) frequencies, it is extraordinarily difficult to directly point <br/>AND<br/>likely pose a safety hazard to the people in or near the beam.<br/>Based on these statements, direct delivery of energy using microwave power to a final application to small, mobile units is not practically feasible with near-term foreseeable technology.

The phrase "in the United States" as used in the 14th Amendment clearly includes States that have been admitted to the Union. Sections 304 and 305 of the INA provide a basis for citizenship of persons born in Alaska and Hawaii while they were territories of the United States. These sections reflect, to a large extent, prior statutes and judicial decisions which addressed the l4th Amendment citizenship implications of birth in these and other U.S. territories. Guidance on evidence on such births should be sought from CA/OCS. b. Sec. 101(a)(38) INA provides that, for the purposes of the INA, The term "United States",... when used in the geographical sense, means the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands of the United States.In addition, under Pub.

All of the aforenamed areas, except Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands, came within the definition of "United States" given in the Nationality Act of 1940, which was effective from January 13, 1941 through December 23, 1952. d. Prior to January 13, 1941, there was no statutory definition of "the United States" for citizenship purposes. Thus there were varying interpretations.

This simply accumulates more separated plutonium, which clearly contradicts Japan’s stated policy of avoiding surplus plutonium. Conclusion A fair degree of uncertainty surrounds Japan’s future nuclear energy plans even after the recent parliamentary election. Nonetheless, it is clear that the scale of nuclear energy use will not support the fuel cycle policy that Japan had pursued for half a century. The new Japanese government should seize the opportunity to change the policy. In particular, it makes little sense to plan to add to Japan’s massive stockpile of plutonium when there is no market for the MOX fuel that would be produced from that stockpile. Separating additional plutonium only contributes to suspicions in neighboring countries that the plant has more to do with Japanese nuclear weapons ambitions than Japanese fuel needs and thus encourages these countries to take matching steps (see box, page 25). The spread of reprocessing technology in the region will aggravate the already volatile security situation in East Asia and could lead to a proliferation chain reaction. Japan’s neighbors and rivals already regard Japan as a virtual nuclear-weapon state. South Korea, which currently is negotiating a new nuclear cooperation agreement with the United States, is insisting that Seoul should be granted the same right as Tokyo to reprocess its spent fuel. North Korea has openly declared its possession of nuclear weapons and carried out tests of nuclear explosives made with plutonium from reprocessed spent fuel. In addition, Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki, at a joint press conference with Japanese Foreign Minister Hirofumi Nakasone in 2009, called for Iran to implement the Japanese nuclear model.~25~ The new Japanese government should immediately announce a moratorium on operation of the Rokkasho reprocessing facility until it determines a long-term spent fuel policy. If the United Kingdom, as anticipated, joins France in planning to burn its separated plutonium in domestic reactors, Japan should seek to negotiate an agreement with those countries to have them burn Japanese plutonium holdings on their territory.~26~ Indeed, a British governmental document supports this idea if Japan is willing to bear the cost.~27~ Domestically, Japan should either vitrify its current holdings of separated plutonium together with high-level waste or transmute separated plutonium into a more stable and safer form for direct disposal using new technology, possibly with a new type of burner reactor. The Monju reactor is likely to be shut down after a certain period of R%26D, but if Tokyo pursues the option of using fast-neutron reactors to reduce radioactive waste by burning actinides for waste management, the Monju reactor might be turned into such a burner reactor. After the end of the Cold War, the international community started paying more attention to a growing accumulation of plutonium originating from civilian and military nuclear programs. Since then, the Japanese government has tried to demonstrate that the country’s accumulated plutonium is strictly limited to peaceful purposes and that it is adhering to the principle of "no surplus plutonium."~28~ With the aim of enhancing transparency, in 1991 the JAEC decided to declare annually Japan’s plutonium stockpile by location.~29~ Furthermore, in 2003, in order to strengthen the principle of avoiding growing plutonium surpluses, the JAEC issued a new guideline for plutonium management. Under that guideline, Japanese electric utilities are expected to publish a plutonium usage plan annually, before they separate plutonium from spent fuel.~30~ Nevertheless, the amount of plutonium continues to increase, generating serious concerns inside and outside the country. This proves that the principle of avoiding surplus plutonium is insufficient. Therefore, civil society and nongovernmental organizations have urged the government to take concrete initiatives to reduce the plutonium stockpile. The U.S.-Japan Nuclear Security Working Group, which was established in November 2010, could decide to address the issues related to excess plutonium in a practical way as the renewal date for the bilateral nuclear cooperation agreement approaches. A Japanese government decision to suspend reprocessing would have benefits far beyond the country’s shores. One effect would be on nuclear security. As Obama’s remarks in South Korea made clear, stockpiles of separated plutonium provide an all-too-attractive target for terrorists. Furthermore, ending the program would contribute to global and regional stability. Several other countries, such as Iran and South Korea, are considering their own reprocessing plans and routinely point to Japan’s program and U.S. acceptance of it as justification for their own efforts. A Japanese decision to forgo reprocessing would deprive those countries of a major argument for developing their nuclear fuel cycles, including reprocessing capabilities, and may substantively affect their decisions on that issue. With tensions soaring between Japan and neighbors such as China, Tokyo’s excess plutonium and advanced nuclear fuel-cycle capability provide a latent nuclear weapons capability that further destabilizes the region’s volatile security environment. It is past time for Japan to end a costly, wasteful, and counterproductive nuclear fuel-cycle policy that undermines global and regional security.</p><p>Causes East Asia nuclear war<br/>Circione, 2K ~Director of the nonproliferation project at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 3/22/00 (Foreign Policy)~</p><p>The blocks would fall quickest and hardest in Asia, where proliferation pressures are already <br/>AND<br/>, perhaps, the first combat use of a nuclear weapon since 1945.</p><p>Solvency</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>Empirically, lifting restrictions on reprocessing does nothing because it’s not economically viable <br/>Frank N. <strong>von Hippel 8</strong>, nuclear physicist, professor of public and international affairs in Princeton University’s Program on Science and Global Security, May 2008, "Rethinking Nuclear Fuel Recycling," Scientific American, Vol. 298, No. 5<br/>Having been awakened by India to the danger of nuclear weapons proliferation through reprocessing, the Ford administration (and later the Carter administration) reexamined the AEC’s position and concluded that reprocessing was both unnecessary and uneconomic. The U.S. government therefore abandoned its plans to reprocess the spent fuel from civilian reactors and urged France and Germany to cancel contracts under which they were exporting reprocessing technology to Pakistan, South Korea and Brazil.<br/>The Reagan administration later reversed the Ford-Carter position on domestic reprocessing, but the U.S. nuclear industry was no longer interested. It, too, had concluded that reprocessing to make use of the recovered plutonium would not be economically competitive with the existing "once-through" fueling system. Reprocessing, at least in the U.S., had reached a dead end, or so it seemed.</p><p>Fuel costs for reprocessing are ten times higher than the once-through fuel cycle <br/>David <strong>Biello 10</strong>, Associate Editor for Scientific American, 4/15/10, "Is Reprocessing the Answer to Eliminating Fissile Materials from Bombs and Nuclear Waste?," <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../www.scientificamerican.com/fi001277.cfm-id=is-reprocessing-the-answer-to-eliminating-fissile-materials" tppabs="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=is-reprocessing-the-answer-to-eliminating-fissile-materials-http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=is-reprocessing-the-answer-to-eliminating-fissile-materials"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=is-reprocessing-the-answer-to-eliminating-fissile-materials-http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=is-reprocessing-the-answer-to-eliminating-fissile-materials</span></a></span><br/>Reprocessing is also expensive. The French spend roughly an extra 800 million euros (241.1 billion) per year for reprocessed fuel compared to conventional uranium fuel rods and the National Research Council estimated in 1996 that reprocessing existing U.S. spent nuclear fuel would cost at least %24100 billion. "The power produced from MOX fuel costs 2 cents more than that produced from uranium fuel," Makhijani says. "It is tenfold higher than the underlying resource cost." <br/>Hanson disagrees. "There’s plenty of money for recycling…. A light water ~nuclear~ reactor is a machine that turns foreign uranium into domestic plutonium." <br/>The mixed oxide fuel rods that result from reprocessing have a mixed track record for <br/>AND<br/>so much.

The pact anticipates further reductions in stockpiled weapon-usable plutonium in the future, according to a State Department press release. <br/>"Entry into force of the agreement also represents a significant milestone in U.S.-Russian cooperation on nuclear security measures, and it marks an essential step in the nuclear disarmament process by making these reductions in plutonium stocks irreversible," the release states. <br/>Moscow and Washington are in discussions with the International Atomic Energy Agency on methods for verifying the pact’s mandates are being carried out (U.S. State Department release, July 13). <br/>"This milestone marks important progress on U.S. and Russian commitments to eliminate nuclear weapons material," Laura Holgate, National Security Council senior director for WMD terrorism and threat reduction, said in provided comments. "Such eliminations are the ultimate in improving nuclear security, as they permanently remove the threat of theft or misuse of nuclear material, at the same time reducing the burden of securing materials." <br/>The plutonium pact was initially inked in 2000 and subsequently updated in April 2010 with a new protocol that authorized Russian to employ fast reactors to irradiate the plutonium under rigorous security standards, the U.S. National Nuclear Security Administration said in a release. <br/>Washington is to give Russia as much as %24400 million for the project, with Moscow paying the remaining costs of the effort — projected to be in excess of %243 billion. The Energy Department’s semiautonomous nuclear agency and its Russian equivalent, Rosatom, are also to pursue foreign donations to defray the costs for Russia. <br/>To carry out the disposal program in the United States, the Energy Department is supervising building of three plants at the Savannah River Site in South Carolina, including the Mixed-Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility that would convert plutonium into nuclear reactor fuel (see GSN, June 17). Russia is also developing its own plutonium conversion technologies and is building the BN-800 fast reactor (U.S. National Nuclear Security Administration release, July 13).</strong></p><p>Relations strong<br/><strong>Ria Novosti 5/10</strong>/12 ~"Russian, U.S. Presidents to Continue ’Reset’," <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../en.rian.ru/russia/20120510/173351119.html~~" tppabs="http://en.rian.ru/russia/20120510/173351119.html~~"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://en.rian.ru/russia/20120510/173351119.html~~</span></a></span> <br/>Russian and U.S. presidents Vladimir Putin and Barack Obama on Wednesday agreed in their telephone conversation to continue the "reset" in the relations between their countries, the White House said in a statement.<br/>"The two Presidents reiterated their interest in the sustained high-level dialogue that has characterized the reset of relations, and the substantial progress of the last three years on issues like nuclear security and non-proliferation, Afghanistan, the WTO, and increased trade and commercial ties," the White House said.<br/>"President Obama and President Putin noted with satisfaction the concrete achievements of the last three years and expressed their commitment to enhance bilateral cooperation on the basis of mutual strategic interests," the statement said.<br/>The two leaders also "commemorated the occasion of Russia’s celebration of Victory in Europe day, noting the historic war-time alliance between our two countries and underscoring their mutual commitment to strengthening the U.S.-Russian partnership."<br/>On Wednesday, the Kremlin reported that Putin and Obama congratulated each other on Victory Day and discussed the prospects of Russian-U.S. relations.<br/>The White House also said Putin told his U.S. counterpart Obama on the phone that he would not attend the G8 summit at Camp David.<br/>"Noting his responsibilities to finalize Cabinet appointments in the new Russian government, President Putin expressed his regret that he would be unable to attend the G8 Summit at Camp David on May 18-19," it said.<br/>"President Obama expressed his understanding of President Putin’s decision and welcomed the participation of Russian Prime Minister ~Dmitry~ Medvedev at the G8 Summit," the White House said.<br/>"President Obama and President Putin agreed to hold a bilateral meeting on the margins of the June 18-19, G20 Summit in Los Cabos, Mexico," it said.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>Zero risk of war<br/>David E. <strong>Hoffman 10/22</strong>/12, contributing editor to Foreign Policy and the author of The Dead Hand: The Untold Story of the Cold War Arms Race and Its Dangerous Legacy, which won the 2010 Pulitzer Prize for general non-fiction, "Hey, Big Spender," Foreign Policy, www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/10/22/hey_big_spender?page=full<br/>Despite tensions that flare up, the United States and Russia are no longer enemies; the chance of nuclear war or surprise attack is nearly zero.

Global Conflicts: Palestine as an anthropology of knowledge<br/>On the game website, GC: P is described as a 3D role-playing simulation game, “which gives the chance to explore the Israeli-Palestinian conflict first-hand” (<span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../learning.seriousgames.dk/learn-more.aspx" tppabs="http://learning.seriousgames.dk/learn-more.aspx"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://learning.seriousgames.dk/learn-more.aspx</span></a></span>, last visited 28-05-2008). The game is targeted at pupils of the age of 12+ in relation to school subjects such as citizenship, history, and media studies. The game lets the player take on the role as a freelance journalist who is sent on various news assignments by an editor. These consists of doing research in order to write an article by walking around in the 3D environment and “interviewing” different sides of the conflict through the acquisition of “quotes”. The quotes are then used for putting together a newspaper article. Before going out to interview people on each assignment, the player will have to choose which newspaper to write for – an Israeli, a Palestinian, or a European newspaper. Having chosen a news angle the player will experience the difficulty of getting enough information from all sides of the story when researching different sides of the conflict: If the player chooses either the Israeli or Palestinian newspaper, the opposite part will be hesitant to deliver information. Similarly, if the player has chosen the more balanced European newspaper then people from both the Israeli and Palestinian side will be suspicious. When a mission is accomplished, the player calls the editorial office, and by making use of the collected quotes, the player constructs an article with a headline and illustrating pictures. The goal is to accomplish as high a news value in the article as possible. This is done by finding as good quotes as possible.<br/>According to the website of Serious Games Interactive (SGI), the company behind GC<br/>AND<br/>of motivating elements by providing a safe, engaging, and realistic environment.<br/>If we look at the knowledge aspects in this educational game, there are certain <br/>AND<br/>classroom, pupils, a teacher, and perhaps an IT-room.<br/>2.3.

Choosing a learning theoretical framework <br/>As suggested by GC:P’s self-description, the game intends to facilitate learning processes, which feature an active learner that experiments and explores different perspectives through critical thinking. Thus, we believe that John Dewey’s theory of inquiry-based learning is a suitable theory for describing the intended learning goals and processes of the game (Dewey 1916, 1933). According to Dewey, pupils learn by inquiring into particular problems through a continual construction and re-construction of experience-based forms of knowledge. Inspired by Dewey, James Paul Gee presents this as a four-stage process, where the player: 1) probes a virtual world, 2) forms a hypothesis based upon reflections, 3 reprobes the game world with that hypothesis in mind, and 4) treats the feedback from the game world through rethinking of his/her original hypothesis (Gee 2003: 90).<br/>Analogous to his theory of inquiry-based learning, Dewey used the metaphorical image <br/>AND<br/>relation to their journalistic aims and the game characters' assigned norms and values.<br/>3. Empirical study <br/>In this section, we will present GC: P through the lens of a multimodal analysis, which relates the designed intentions of the game scenario to teachers and pupils’ perceptions of the realised game. This analysis does not represent a finished analysis, but consists of selected examples in line with the goal of this paper, which is to explore and discuss the discrepancy between the intentions of educational games and realised educational goals.<br/>3.1. Setup<br/>In this pilot study, GC<img src="../../../resources/icons/silk/emoticon_tongue.png" tppabs="http://opencaselist.paperlessdebate.com/xwiki/resources/icons/silk/emoticon_tongue.png" class="wikimodel-freestanding" alt="emoticon_tongue"/>&nbsp;was used in a simple 1 ½ <br/>AND<br/>, as ICT is embedded in many activities of the everyday school life.<br/>3.1.1.

Thus, we will briefly describe how these work in the game. When a player has finished his or her collection of quotes via the in-game “interviews” the player calls in the article to “the editorial office”. Here there is a shift from the 3D world to a 2D article platform, where the player builds the article using the quotes taken during the interviews. As figure 1 shows the article platform is divided in two parts: An article template in the left of the screen and, to the right side of the screen, three categories with three possible options of which the article is build: headlines, notes and pictures. The headlines present three different political value sets: the Israeli perspective, the Palestinian perspective and the balanced perspective. The player must then choose the right headline that fits with the political angle of the article. Choosing one of three pictures to illustrate the content is optional.<br/>Figure 1: Article template and feedback section in Global Conflicts: Palestine (SGI, 2007) April 2008.<br/>Finally, the player selects three quotes out of the maximum of 15 quotes from the virtual notebook and place these three quotes as ‘head text’, ‘body text’ or ‘sub text’. Each quote is evaluated on its news value (see figure 1, left picture). At the bottom of the right side of the screen information is shown on the status of the article (total news value of the article and an Israeli/Palestinian alignment status on article level) and the status of the player progression (‘intern’, ‘apprentice’ and ‘reporter’-level and an Israeli/Palestinian alignment status on player level). When the article is constructed, the player sends it to the in-game newspaper office by pressing the submit button. Then a piece of evaluating text pops up explaining the editor’s perception of the article and its final placement in the newspaper (see figure 1, right picture).<br/>3.2. Empirical findings<br/>The preliminary analysis of the empirical data from the pilot study is primarily based upon <br/>AND<br/>quantitative versus qualitative evaluation of the quotes when “writing” the article.<br/>Examining the first point, the pupils found the absence of syntactic coherence between the quotes in the article template to be quite problematic:<br/>Pupil B: “It doesn’t really fit together as an article, and maybe that doesn’t matter, because afterwards you don’t need the article. But when there are three quotes and a picture, and there is no other text… well, I think it was difficult to make it fit together.”<br/>Questioner: “You mean that the quotes didn’t fit in a verbal sense?”<br/>Pupil B: “Yes, if there are three different points of views, and they are not really tied together, if you haven’t played the game yourself, right. If you just saw those three quotes, you would think ’what do these have to do with each other?’ They have something to do with each other, but it is quite difficult to show, when there is no…”<br/>Questioner: interrupts “For other people to understand?”<br/>Pupil B: “Yes, exactly.”<br/>(Pupil focus group interview, no. 1, 10/04/2008)<br/>It was a general experience among the pupils that the quotes in the article template <br/>AND<br/>to others, instead of merely using the output for their own evaluation. <br/>This leads us to the second point, which concerns the pupils’ need for qualifying the content of the article with their own personal conceptions of the context in a mission. Here they are asked for comments on the article platform:<br/>Pupil B: “I just think that you should make the judgment yourself instead of the &nbsp;computer.”<br/>Questioner: “Would that be nice if you could do that yourself?”<br/>Pupil B: “It would be more interesting, because concerning this selection, you would discover ’okay, this is good’ or ’oh well, it isn’t, anyway’, then it is one’s own opinion when it is yourself writing the newspaper. And of course you would go after making it your own, but then again, you also wanted the best evaluation.”<br/>Pupil A: “But there are only statements and quotes from the people, you didn’t report anything yourself at all.”<br/>Pupil C: “There could have been some options where you could be able to write &nbsp;something yourself. (…)”<br/>Questioner: “It could have been nice if this option was available?”<br/>Pupil A: “Well, maybe that would have been more journalistic, or more right.”<br/>Pupil C: “It would have been more personal, if you could express your own &nbsp;opinion, you could say.” <br/>(Pupil focus group interview no. 2, 10/04/2008)<br/>As this excerpt suggests, the pupils expressed a need for being able to evaluate <br/>AND<br/>players’ current possibilities for recognising his/her knowledge deficiencies are rather blurred.<br/>Furthermore, the pupil’s lacking sense of self-control over the “interviews” <br/>AND<br/>describing her reflections on how the pupils’ reacted on playing GC<img src="../../../resources/icons/silk/emoticon_tongue.png" tppabs="http://opencaselist.paperlessdebate.com/xwiki/resources/icons/silk/emoticon_tongue.png" class="wikimodel-freestanding" alt="emoticon_tongue"/>.<br/>“The pupils complained that they were able to figure it out in some way, when it the quote has a high news value. They were disappointed that it was ‘laid out on the table’. It would have been nice if they had to think for themselves, and then afterwards they could see whether it had news value or not, or more alignment, or what it was.”<br/>(Teacher interview 10/04/2008, our markings)<br/>The teacher would clearly value teaching her pupils critical and independent thinking. She would several times use the phrase “using the brain” during the play session and debriefing with the pupils, which, to her, represents the core of critical thinking. These findings points to a general discussion about quantitative and qualitative approaches to the acquisition of knowledge and cognitive skills. As suggested by an interview, the game designers are fully aware of this discussion:<br/>“If you consider it structurally, then the problem is that an… an <br/>AND<br/>for this qualification if it doesn’t fit with the logic of the game.”<br/>(interview with CEO Simon Egenfeldt-Nielsen, SGI 08/04/2008)<br/>Another empirical finding we find worth mentioning is that the actual dialogue between the pupils <br/>AND<br/>they had to read the text before being able to make a choice.<br/>4. Educational goals versus game elements<br/>In this section, we wish to discuss the discursive modes that are represented in <br/>AND<br/>interpretations of what they had grasped as relevant information from the game missions.<br/>In summary, both teachers and pupils’ questioned the lack of a more engaging and <br/>AND<br/>as one of the educational goals of the game on the other side.<br/>When analyzing GC: P from a multimodal discourse analytical perspective, there appears to <br/>AND<br/>score points that measure the “trust” of the Israelis and Palestinians.<br/>Furthermore, the game representations raise certain expectations among the pupils, which influence the <br/>AND<br/>pupils were only able to imitate the process of “writing an article”.<br/>From the game designer’s perspective, this discrepancy makes sense, since, as the <br/>AND<br/>-practice exercise, where the pupils simply click through the different quotes. <br/>5. Discussion<br/>The aim of this paper is to open a crucial discussion about the discrepancy between <br/>AND<br/>forms of organisation (Barth 2002, Klabbers 2006, Hanghøj in press). <br/>In our pilot study of GC<img src="../../../resources/icons/silk/emoticon_tongue.png" tppabs="http://opencaselist.paperlessdebate.com/xwiki/resources/icons/silk/emoticon_tongue.png" class="wikimodel-freestanding" alt="emoticon_tongue"/>, we found that there was a <br/>AND<br/>computerised systems of educational computer games should be able to provide this feedback. <br/>GC<img src="../../../resources/icons/silk/emoticon_tongue.png" tppabs="http://opencaselist.paperlessdebate.com/xwiki/resources/icons/silk/emoticon_tongue.png" class="wikimodel-freestanding" alt="emoticon_tongue"/>&nbsp;is a game that promises to teach pupils critical thinking.
