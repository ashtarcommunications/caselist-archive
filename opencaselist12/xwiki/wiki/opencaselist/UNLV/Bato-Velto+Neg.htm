As Ross Wilson noted, “President Obama has a four-year record with Russia to defend – i.e., the reset policy and the benefits that the administration will argue have accrued from its more pragmatic and less confrontational approach to relations with Moscow.”<br/>President Obama’s policy of reset was indeed a glimmer of hope for US-Russian relations at the start of 2009, but that glimmer has all but faded. The case of Syria and Iran are clear examples of the real challenges America still faces when engaging with Russia on global issues and the Obama campaign will most likely avoid referring to the “reset” by name.<br/>“Though the Administration will not use the expression ‘reset’ too much, it can be expected to continue to emphasize pragmatism and to implement that line if the president is re-elected,” Wilson believes.<br/>Obama’s opponent, Mitt Romney, has been less clear about his position on relations <br/>AND<br/>no Cold War, but Russia is a geopolitical foe in that regard."<br/>The Romney campaign’s web site reveals several areas of focus for Russia, none of them discuss active engagement, but rather focus on taking tougher stances with Russia, including renegotiating the New Start Treaty, decreasing Europe’s energy reliance on Russia, building stronger relations with Central Asia, as well as supporting Russia’s civil society. <br/>Surprisingly, the last one, engaging Russia’s civil society, could be the most <br/>AND<br/>in the opposition – it could hurt the entire goal of this platform.<br/>Having the American government play an active role in the changes happening inside Russia could be detrimental to US-Russian relations. Many Russians believe that changes within their own country should be driven from the Russian society.

These claims have largely not been realized. ¶ Global Warming is a Given: A just-released report from EIA shows the actual world energy consumption data and projected consumption data for the 1990 to 2035 period. The report shows world energy consumption is estimated to increase from 505 quads in 2008 to 770 quads in 2035, a 52% increase. The biggest part of the increase is by (non-OECD nations + Asia).¶ <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../www.eia.gov/forecasts/ieo/world.cfm" tppabs="http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/ieo/world.cfm"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/ieo/world.cfm</span></a></span>¶ See spreadsheet associated with figure 12¶ World energy consumption by fuel (quadrillion Btu) ¶ Liquids: From 173.2 in 2010 to 225.1 in 2035; 30% more¶ Natural gas: 116.7 to 174.7; 50% more¶ Coal: 149.4 to 209.1; 49% more¶ Nuclear: 27.6 to 51.2; 86% more¶ Renewables: 55.2 to 109.5; 98% more¶ Renewables fraction of total consumption: From 10.6% in 2010 to 15.2% in 2035¶ Fossil fraction of total consumption: 84.1% to 79.1%¶ The significant increase in projected fossil fuel consumption during the next 24 years means global warming will continue unabated, because (non-OECD + ASIA) will have energy consumption growth far outpacing the energy consumption growth of the rest of the world; i.e., global warming is a given. ¶ The above indicates the enormous investments required to achieve the 2035 projected renewables energy production would have practically no benefit regarding global warming.¶ This means policy makers should shift renewables subsidies to energy efficiency which will not only reduce CO2 without controversies, but will actually do some good for household and business energy bills and thereby raise their living standards and profits.¶ That would be the rational thing to do. However, using Greenspan's words, the people, including legislators and bureaucrats, have become "irrationally exuberant" regarding renewables reducing global warming. The above shows, it is an expensive and futile tilting at wind mills a la Don Quixote.¶ Competitiveness: The above begs the question: If wind energy reduces CO2 by so very little/kWh, or not at all, or increases it, AND requires so much capital/MW to implement, AND produces energy at such a high cost/kWh, AND has such huge adverse impacts on quality of life (noise and infrasound, visuals, social unrest, psychological), property values and the environment, why are we, as a nation, making ourselves even less efficient relative to our competitors by this slavish, lemming-like pursuit of expensive wind energy?¶ Who Benefits: Could it be that the Wall Street elites see the 30% federal cash grants, accelerated write-offs, generous feed-in tariffs and renewable energy credits as major tax shelters and long-term income streams (preferably tax-free) for themselves and their high-income clients, all at the expense of the Main Street economy which is already economically depressed? ¶ If the amounts of the grants and taxes-not-collected due to these deductions from taxable incomes are totaled, it would be evident wind energy is very expensively subsidized indeed; not helpful for reducing budget deficits.¶ Roll more and more such expensive wind energy into rate schedules and the US will become even less competitive than at present: not helpful for reducing trade deficits. ¶ Wind energy promoters often use Denmark as the model to emulate. However, Denmark is in the unique position of having a large capacity of hydro plants of Norway and Sweden available for balancing wind energy; i.e., other grids with little or no hydro plants cannot use Denmark as a model. This unique position has been unfortunate for Danish households, because their electric rates are the highest in Europe; France, 80% nuclear, has the lowest.<br/>Plan won’t create a wind market<br/>Murphy, 12 (Robert, economist with IER specializing in climate change, received his Ph.D. in economics from New York University, Institute for Energy Research, “Assessing the Production Tax Credit”, 4/24/12, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/2012/04/24/assessing-the-production-tax-credit/)" tppabs="http://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/2012/04/24/assessing-the-production-tax-credit/)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/2012/04/24/assessing-the-production-tax-credit/)</span></a></span> WP<br/>Recognizing what Americans’ priorities are in a time of severe recession, proponents of extending <br/>AND<br/>be able to survive on a level tax- and regulatory playing field.<br/>Wind destroys the grid—Makes failures worse<br/>Tverberg, 12 (Gail, received a M.S. in Mathematics from the University of Illinois, Fellow of the Casualty Actuarial Society and a Member of the American Academy of Actuaries, Much of her early career was spent with CNA Insurance Companies in Chicago, Illinois.

These claims have largely not been realized. ¶ Global Warming is a Given: A just-released report from EIA shows the actual world energy consumption data and projected consumption data for the 1990 to 2035 period. The report shows world energy consumption is estimated to increase from 505 quads in 2008 to 770 quads in 2035, a 52% increase. The biggest part of the increase is by (non-OECD nations + Asia).¶ <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../www.eia.gov/forecasts/ieo/world.cfm" tppabs="http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/ieo/world.cfm"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/ieo/world.cfm</span></a></span>¶ See spreadsheet associated with figure 12¶ World energy consumption by fuel (quadrillion Btu) ¶ Liquids: From 173.2 in 2010 to 225.1 in 2035; 30% more¶ Natural gas: 116.7 to 174.7; 50% more¶ Coal: 149.4 to 209.1; 49% more¶ Nuclear: 27.6 to 51.2; 86% more¶ Renewables: 55.2 to 109.5; 98% more¶ Renewables fraction of total consumption: From 10.6% in 2010 to 15.2% in 2035¶ Fossil fraction of total consumption: 84.1% to 79.1%¶ The significant increase in projected fossil fuel consumption during the next 24 years means global warming will continue unabated, because (non-OECD + ASIA) will have energy consumption growth far outpacing the energy consumption growth of the rest of the world; i.e., global warming is a given. ¶ The above indicates the enormous investments required to achieve the 2035 projected renewables energy production would have practically no benefit regarding global warming.¶ This means policy makers should shift renewables subsidies to energy efficiency which will not only reduce CO2 without controversies, but will actually do some good for household and business energy bills and thereby raise their living standards and profits.¶ That would be the rational thing to do. However, using Greenspan's words, the people, including legislators and bureaucrats, have become "irrationally exuberant" regarding renewables reducing global warming.

As Ross Wilson noted, “President Obama has a four-year record with Russia to defend – i.e., the reset policy and the benefits that the administration will argue have accrued from its more pragmatic and less confrontational approach to relations with Moscow.”<br/>President Obama’s policy of reset was indeed a glimmer of hope for US-Russian relations at the start of 2009, but that glimmer has all but faded. The case of Syria and Iran are clear examples of the real challenges America still faces when engaging with Russia on global issues and the Obama campaign will most likely avoid referring to the “reset” by name.<br/>“Though the Administration will not use the expression ‘reset’ too much, it can be expected to continue to emphasize pragmatism and to implement that line if the president is re-elected,” Wilson believes.<br/>Obama’s opponent, Mitt Romney, has been less clear about his position on relations <br/>AND<br/>no Cold War, but Russia is a geopolitical foe in that regard."<br/>The Romney campaign’s web site reveals several areas of focus for Russia, none of them discuss active engagement, but rather focus on taking tougher stances with Russia, including renegotiating the New Start Treaty, decreasing Europe’s energy reliance on Russia, building stronger relations with Central Asia, as well as supporting Russia’s civil society. <br/>Surprisingly, the last one, engaging Russia’s civil society, could be the most <br/>AND<br/>in the opposition – it could hurt the entire goal of this platform.<br/>Having the American government play an active role in the changes happening inside Russia could be detrimental to US-Russian relations. Many Russians believe that changes within their own country should be driven from the Russian society. Any outside interference would hurt the legitimacy of the Russian opposition and cause the Russian elite to become even more suspicious, and perhaps even hostile, to the intentions of American foreign policy.</p><p>Extinction<br/>Collins and Rojansky 10 – * U.S. Ambassador to the Russian Federation from 1997 to 2001, AND <strong>deputy director of the Russia and Eurasia Program at the Carnegie Endowment (8/18/10, James F.

It’s the same approach America relied on for a century. President Obama recognizes it is time for something new. Obama has presided over the largest increase in clean energy this nation has ever seen. Thanks to a combination of government policies and private sector gumption, roughly 35 percent of all new power built in the United States in the last four years came from wind. The solar industry is 10 times the size it was just a few years ago and employs more than 100,000 Americans. Obama has made history by raising fuel efficiency standards to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. By pushing cars to go farther on a tank of gas, these standards will save consumers %241.7 trillion at the pump. Automakers are already hiring workers to get these cars on the road. Labor unions and automakers estimate the new standards will generate 570,000 jobs across the <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="economyhttp://www.bluegreenalliance.org/news/publications/gearing-up."><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">economyhttp://www.bluegreenalliance.org/news/publications/gearing-up.</span></a></span> And because the standards cut our oil imports by one-third, they represent the biggest step America has taken to confront climate change. The administration also set the first-ever limits on carbon pollution from new power plants-a move that will help America create a cleaner, 21st century power fleet and reduce the threat of global warming. These breakthroughs secure our nation’s leadership of the 21st century global energy market. And they confirm the value of forward-looking innovation. Romney prefers to look to the past.

The incident was referred to as "nuclear genocide," and the press wrote of "forests stained red" and of deformed insects. The public was bombarded with images of Soviet cleanup crews wearing protective suits, bald-headed children with cancer and the members of cement crews who lost their lives in an attempt to seal off the cracked reactor with a concrete plug. Fifteen years after the reactor accident, the German newsmagazine Focus concluded that Chernobyl was responsible for "500,000" deaths. Was all this just doomsday folklore? There is no doubt that large sections of the countryside were contaminated by the accident in the Ukraine. In the ensuing decades, up to 4,000 cleanup workers and residents of the more highly contaminated areas died of the long-term consequences of radiation exposure. But the six-figure death counts that opponents of nuclear power once cited are simply nonsense. In most cases, they were derived from vague "extrapolations" based on the hearsay reported by Russian dissidents. But such horror stories have remained part of the nuclear narrative to this day. In fact, contemporaries who reported on the Chernobyl incident should have known better. Even in the 1980s, radiobiologists and radiation physicists considered the media’s doomsday reports to be exaggerated. And their suspicions have become a virtual certainty today. Groups of researchers have set up shop at all of the sites of nuclear accidents or major nuclear contamination. They work at Hanford (where the United States began producing plutonium in 1944), they conduct studies in the English town of Sellafield (where a contaminated cloud escaped from the chimney in 1957), and they study the fates of former East German uranium mineworkers in the states of Saxony and Thuringia. New mortality rates have now been compiled for all of these groups of individuals at risk. Surprisingly, the highest mortality rates were found among the East German mineworkers. In Hiroshima, on the other hand, radioactivity claimed surprisingly few human lives. Experts now know exactly what happened in the first hours, days and weeks after the devastating atomic explosion. Almost all of Hiroshima’s 140,000 victims died quickly. Either they were crushed immediately by the shock wave, or they died within the next few days of acute burns. But the notorious radiation sickness — a gradual ailment that leads to certain death for anyone exposed to radiation levels of 6 Gray or higher — was rare. The reason is that Little Boy simply did not produce enough radioactivity. But what about the long-term consequences? Didn’t the radiation work like a time bomb in the body? To answer these questions, the Japanese and the Americans launched a giant epidemiological study after the war. The study included all residents of Hiroshima and Nagasaki who had survived the atomic explosion within a 10-kilometer (6.2-mile) radius. Investigators questioned the residents to obtain their precise locations when the bomb exploded, and used this information to calculate a personal radiation dose for each resident. Data was collected for 86,572 people. Today, 60 years later, the study’s results are clear. More than 700 people eventually died as a result of radiation received from the atomic attack: 87 died of leukemia; 440 died of tumors; and 250 died of radiation-induced heart attacks. In addition, 30 fetuses developed mental disabilities after they were born. Such statistics have attracted little notice so far. The numbers cited in schoolbooks are much higher. According to Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia, 105,000 people died of the "long-term consequences of radiation." "For commendable reasons, many critics have greatly exaggerated the health risks of radioactivity," says Albrecht Kellerer, a Munich radiation biologist. "But contrary to widespread opinion, the number of victims is by no means in the tens of thousands." Especially surprising, though, is that the stories of birth defects in newborns are also pure fantasy. The press has repeatedly embellished photos of a destroyed Hiroshima with those of deformed children, children without eyes or with three arms. In reality, there hasn’t been a single study that provides evidence of an elevated rate of birth defects. A final attempt to establish a connection is currently underway in Japan. The study includes 3,600 people who were unborn fetuses in their mothers’ wombs on that horrific day in August 1945. But it too has failed to furnish any evidence of elevated chromosomal abnormality. In Germany, where nuclear fears have coalesced with the fear of dying forests and mad cow disease into a general psychosis of threat, the degree of concern over nuclear radiation remains high. To this day, some are so fearful about the long-term effects of fallout from Chernobyl that they refuse to eat mushrooms from Bavaria. Even 20 years ago such behavior would not have made sense.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h3 id="HBasing" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Basing</span></h3><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HNoRiskofCyberTerror2013LackCapacityandDoesn2019tMeetthePublicityGoalsofTerrorism" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>No Risk of Cyber Terror – Lack Capacity and Doesn’t Meet the Publicity Goals of Terrorism</span></h4><p>Maura Conway Lecturer in International Security in the School of Law and Government at Dublin City University in Dublin, Ireland 2011 Against Cyberterrorism: Why cyber-based terrorist attacks are unlikely to occur Against Cyberterrorism: Why cyber-based terrorist attacks are unlikely to occur.

It’s the same approach America relied on for a century. President Obama recognizes it is time for something new. Obama has presided over the largest increase in clean energy this nation has ever seen. Thanks to a combination of government policies and private sector gumption, roughly 35 percent of all new power built in the United States in the last four years came from wind. The solar industry is 10 times the size it was just a few years ago and employs more than 100,000 Americans. Obama has made history by raising fuel efficiency standards to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. By pushing cars to go farther on a tank of gas, these standards will save consumers %241.7 trillion at the pump. Automakers are already hiring workers to get these cars on the road. Labor unions and automakers estimate the new standards will generate 570,000 jobs across the <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="economyhttp://www.bluegreenalliance.org/news/publications/gearing-up."><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">economyhttp://www.bluegreenalliance.org/news/publications/gearing-up.</span></a></span> And because the standards cut our oil imports by one-third, they represent the biggest step America has taken to confront climate change. The administration also set the first-ever limits on carbon pollution from new power plants-a move that will help America create a cleaner, 21st century power fleet and reduce the threat of global warming. These breakthroughs secure our nation’s leadership of the 21st century global energy market. And they confirm the value of forward-looking innovation. Romney prefers to look to the past. He would dish out subsidies to mature oil and gas companies-some of the richest in the world-but starve clean energy innovators. Romney said he would kill the Production Tax Credit, the most effective incentive for wind energy and one that enjoys broad bipartisan support. The Ryan budget, meanwhile, would hand over %2440 billion in taxpayer dollars to oil companies at the same time it cuts clean energy investments 90 percent, down to just %241 billion.</p><h4 id="HNowiskeytocurbingclimatechange2013windpowersendsaninternationalsignal" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Now is key to curbing climate change – wind power sends an international signal</span></h4><p><strong>Global Wind Energy Council ’12 ("</strong>Wind Energy Must be Key Climate Change Solution," <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../www.gwec.net/index.php-id=136-http---www.gwec.net-index.php-id=136" tppabs="http://www.gwec.net/index.php?id=136-http://www.gwec.net/index.php?id=136"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.gwec.net/index.php?id=136-http://www.gwec.net/index.php?id=136</span></a></span>, Mike)<br/>Climate change is now generally accepted to be the greatest environmental threat facing the world<br/>AND<br/>and the finance sector need for wind power to reach its full potential.&nbsp;</p><h4 id="HClimatechangeresultsinmultiplescenariosforextinction2013it2019stryordiefortheaff" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Climate change results in multiple scenarios for extinction – it’s try or die for the aff</span></h4><p><strong>Sawin Senior Director of the Energy and Climate Change Program at the WorldWatch Institute Aug. ’12&nbsp;</strong>(Janet, "Climate Change Poses Greater Security Threat than Terrorism," <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../www.worldwatch.org/node/77" tppabs="http://www.worldwatch.org/node/77"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.worldwatch.org/node/77</span></a></span>, Mike)<br/>As early as 1988, scientists cautioned that human tinkering with the Earth’s climate amounted <br/>AND<br/>carbon, with meaningful long-term targets that incorporate gradually declining caps.&nbsp;</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h3 id="H1NCSolvency-2" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>1NC Solvency</span></h3><h4 id="HPriorcourtdecisionsdoingexactlywhattheywanttodointhecontextofColdWartraumaprovetheirmethodaccomplishesnothing" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Prior court decisions doing exactly what they want to do in the context of Cold War trauma prove their method accomplishes nothing</span></h4><p><strong>Leege 2012</strong> (David, J.D. candidate, May 2012, Catholic University of America, Columbus School of Law; M.S.
