Payments can be comprised of electricity alone or of electricity bundled with renewable energy certificates (REC)... These payments are generally awarded as long-term contracts set over a period of 15-20 years. FIT policies can be understood as an advanced form of production-based incentive (PBI), where a payment is awarded for the actual electricity produced ($/kWh).”¶ A California Energy Commission report leaves the definition of a feed-in tariff relatively vague and then later identifies that what is bought and sold can include electricity only, or can also include RECs and/or other bundled environmental attributes when adapted to the US context:¶ “A simple definition of a feed-in tariff is an offering of a guaranteed payment over a specified term with specified operating conditions to eligible renewable energy generators (although some feed-in tariffs step down in price over time) and can be either an all-inclusive rate or a premium payment on top of the prevailing spot market price for power. The price paid represents estimates of either the cost or value of renewable generation. The tariff is generally offered by the interconnecting utility and sets a standing price for each category of eligible renewable generator; the price is available to all eligible generators. Tariffs are often differentiated based on technology type, resource quality, or project size, and may decline on a set schedule over time.” iii¶ Feed-in tariff structures are typically either fixed payments based on an electricity generator’s cost to produce electricity, or as a fixed premium paid above the spot market or wholesale market price of electricity. These fixed payments are long-term contracts for anywhere from five to thirty years in duration.iv And here lies the legal problem that is examined more below: Despite reports giving little treatment to the legal requirements, mandating a payment based on what is demanded by the producer, rather than what renewable power is objectively worth to the buyer in the market, sets a state-mandated wholesale price that is contrary to federal law, guarding against “unjustified” or “unreasonable” prices paid for wholesale power.¶ Feed-in tariffs, whether implemented by themselves or though REC market prices (discussed below), increase the power sale price for certain wholesale renewable technologies to an amount that is deemed administratively and politically necessary to encourage their development, rather than what the value of the power is actually worth in the market to the purchaser. Feed-in tariffs exceed market wholesale prices and utility-avoided costs, and therefore are justified only by their objectives and results, and not typically by accepted ratemaking methodology, which aims to minimize generating costs to prudent and reasonable market levels.¶ Feed-in tariffs have been successful in encouraging significant renewable energy development with 45% of global wind power deployment and 75% of solar PV deployment attributable to feed-in tariff policies through 2008.v Often, feed-in rates are differentiated by technology and are based on the cost to the producer of deploying a given renewable energy technology.viCosts of a feed-in tariff are passed on to retail consumers by purchasing energy suppliers and reflect a public policy decision to increase the percentage of renewable electricity sources in use.¶ Internationally¶ Italy, Sweden, and the United Kingdom initially favored RPSs, while Germany, Spain, and other countries favored feed-in tariffs. Germany, Denmark, and Spain, while only a small fraction of the size of the United States in square miles, were responsible for 53% of total installed global wind power capacity between 1990 and 2005.vii Germany receives 5% of its total energy from wind power, Demark nearly 20%, and Germany surpassed its 12.5% goal of renewable electricity by 2009, three years earlier than expected.viii¶ Germany’s feed-in tariff program created the world’s largest solar energy market. In Germany, the current debate is whether the expense of feed-in tariffs is too high given what their consumers are willing to support.ix The average German electric bill has increased by roughly $3 per month (€1.45/month)x over the period of feed-in tariff implementation.xi The German public has generally supported the increase, especially since many individuals have taken advantage of the incentives to install their own renewable energy generation systems.xii¶ The European Commission concluded that feed-in tariffs are more effective than quota-based tradable REC systems.xiii For example, Germany’s wind power was on average more than 20 % cheaper than wind power installed under a tradable REC system in the UK.xiv Similar findings have since been reported by the Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change (2006),xv the International Energy Agency,xvi in analyses conducted on behalf of the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities in the United States,xvii and by Ernst and Young.xviii¶ In the United States¶ Feed-in tariffs have not historically been sanctioned in the U.S. The most prevalent renewable energy policy enacted by states is the Renewable Portfolio Standard (“RPS”) with a REC component. The two are similar to the extent that they only qualify renewable power that is actually produced. The feed-in tariff does this by linking the renewable subsidy to the price paid for renewable power, while the RPS does this by creating a separate tradable renewable attribute, or REC.¶ However, the momentum and impact of European feed-in tariff policies has caused some U.S. states to propose legislation and adopt policies similar to European feed-in tariffs (FiTs). As many as ten states have introduced actual feed-in tariff legislation, while a handful of others are considering feed-in tariff policies. That groups includes Arkansas, California, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and Washington State. Vermont was the first US state to implement a FIT in 2009,xix for long-term contracts for 15-25 years at tariffs differentiated by technology and size (ranging from $0.12 – 0.30/kWh), with an individual project cap of 2.2 MW.¶ The Supremacy Clause, Federal Preemption and Wholesale Rates¶ Sections 205 and 206 of the FPA empower FERC to regulate rates for the interstate and wholesale sale and transmission of electricity.xx In doing so, the act bestows upon FERC broad power to shape the energy market affecting all stakeholders. By exercising exclusive authority over “just and reasonable” rates and terms, FERC is charged with responsibility to ensure that wholesale generators of electric power will charge fair rates to retailers, and that wholesale generators receive a fair rate of return, and thus “have the incentive to continue to produce and supply power.xxi</li></ol><p>2.

Rogers (2003) defines incentives as a direct or indirect payment of cash or in kind that is given to an individual or system in order to encourage behaviour change and speed up adoption. Incentives can take many forms for example, taxes, grants, penalties, finder’s fees, bonuses. Oltra and Saint-Jean (2006) suggest that government grants to support alternative fuel infrastructure, tax exemptions for inconvenience and negative taxation for ICEV could secure the switch from ICEVs to LCVs. Akerman and Hojer (2006) observes in the 1980’s tax incentives on unleaded petrol and lower emitting vehicles successfully promoted three-way-catalytic- converters. For high mileage users, Vries and Rouwendal (1999) and Wissen and Golob (1992) also found financial incentives encouraged LCV adoption. Moreover, Lane and Potter (2007) emphasises that the benefit of incentives in combating the barriers of high purchase price, serving costs and long payback periods associated with many LCVs, concluding that the UK company car tax is a crucial factor in determining employee’s car choice and the UK Government’s Powershift grant to be an important factorencouraging the purchase of the Toyota Prius hybrid.<br/>4.

This glossary provides a description of each specific incentive and policy type.<br/>FINANCIAL INCENTIVES <br/>Corporate Tax Incentives<br/>Corporate tax incentives include tax credits, deductions and exemptions. These incentives are available in some states to corporations that purchase and install eligible renewable energy or energy efficiency equipment, or to construct green buildings. In a few cases, the incentive is based on the amount of energy produced by an eligible facility. Some states allow the tax credit only if a corporation has invested a minimum amount in an eligible project. Typically, there is a maximum limit on the dollar amount of the credit or deduction. In recent years, the federal government has offered corporate tax incentives for renewables and energy efficiency. (Note that corporate tax incentives designed to support manufacturing and the development of renewable energy systems or equipment, or energy efficiency equipment, are categorized as “Industry Recruitment/Support” in DSIRE.)<br/>Grant Programs<br/>States offer a variety of grant programs to encourage the use and development of renewables and energy efficiency. Most programs offer support for a broad range of technologies, while a few programs focus on promoting a single technology, such as photovoltaic (PV) systems. Grants are available primarily to the commercial, industrial, utility, education and/or government sectors. Most grant programs are designed to pay down the cost of eligible systems or equipment. Others focus on research and development, or support project commercialization. In recent years, the federal government has offered grants for renewables and energy efficiency projects for end-users. Grants are usually competitive.<br/>Green Building Incentives<br/>Green buildings are designed and constructed using practices and materials that minimize the impacts of the building on the environment and human health. Many cities and counties offer financial incentives to promote green building. The most common form of incentive is a reduction or waiver of a building permit fee. Several organizations issue certification for green buildings, including the U.S. Green Building Council (LEED certification), the Green Building Initiative (Green Globes certification), and the NAHB Research Center (National Green Building Certification). (Note that this category includes green building incentives that do not fall under other DSIRE incentive categories, such as tax incentives and grant programs.)<br/>Industry Recruitment/Support<br/>To promote economic development and the creation of jobs, some states offer financial incentives to recruit or cultivate the manufacturing and development of renewable energy systems and equipment. These incentives commonly take the form of tax credits, tax exemptions and grants. In some cases, the amount of the incentive depends on the quantity of eligible equipment that a company manufactures. Most of these incentives apply to several renewable energy technologies, but a few states target specific technologies, such as wind or solar. These incentives are usually designed as temporary measures to support industries in their early years. They commonly include a sunset provision to encourage the industries to become self-sufficient.<br/>Loan Programs<br/>Loan programs provide financing for the purchase of renewable energy or energy efficiency systems or equipment. Low-interest or zero-interest loans for energy efficiency projects are a common demand-side management (DSM) practice for electric utilities. State governments also offer low-interest loans for a broad range of renewable energy and energy efficiency measures. These programs are commonly available to the residential, commercial, industrial, transportation, public and/or non-profit sectors. Loan rates and terms vary by program; in some cases, they are determined on an individual project basis. Loan terms are generally 10 years or less. In recent years, the federal government has offered loans and/or loan guarantees for renewables and energy efficiency projects.<br/>PACE Financing<br/>Property-Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) financing effectively allows property owners to borrow money to pay for renewable energy and/or energy-efficiency improvements. The amount borrowed is typically repaid over a period of years via a special assessment on the owner's property. In general, local governments (such as cities and counties) that choose to offer PACE financing must be authorized to do so by state law.<br/>Performance-Based Incentives<br/>Performance-based incentives (PBIs), also known as production incentives, provide cash payments based on the number of kilowatt-hours (kWh) or BTUs generated by a renewable energy system. A "feed-in tariff" is an example of a PBI. To ensure project quality, payments based on a system’s actual performance are generally more effective than payments based on a system’s rated capacity. (Note that tax incentives based on the amount of energy produced by an eligible commercial facility are categorized as “Corporate Tax Incentives” in DSIRE.)<br/>Personal Tax Incentives<br/>Personal tax incentives include income tax credits and deductions. Many states offer these incentives to reduce the expense of purchasing and installing renewable energy or energy efficiency systems and equipment. The percentage of the credit or deduction varies by state, and in most cases, there is a maximum limit on the dollar amount of the credit or deduction. An allowable credit may include carryover provisions, or it may be structured so that the credit is spread out over a certain number of years. Eligible technologies vary widely by state. In recent years, the federal government has offered personal tax credits for renewables and energy efficiency.<br/>Property Tax Incentives<br/>Property tax incentives include exemptions, exclusions, abatements and credits. Most property tax incentives provide that the added value of a renewable energy system is excluded from the valuation of the property for taxation purposes. For example, if a new heating system that uses renewable energy costs more than a conventional heating system, the additional cost of the renewable energy system is not included in the property assessment. In a few cases, property tax incentives apply to the additional cost of a green building. Because property taxes are collected locally, some states have granted local taxing authorities the option of allowing a property tax incentive for renewables.<br/>Rebate Programs<br/>States, utilities and a few local governments offer rebates to promote the installation of renewables and energy efficiency projects. The majority of rebate programs that support renewables are administered by states, municipal utilities and electric cooperatives; these programs commonly provide funding for solar water heating and/or photovoltaic (PV) systems. Most rebate programs that support energy efficiency are administered by utilities. Rebate amounts vary widely by technology and program administrator.<br/>Sales Tax Incentives<br/>Sales tax incentives typically provide an exemption from, or refund of, the state sales tax (or sales and use tax) for the purchase of a renewable energy system, an energy-efficient appliance, or other energy efficiency measures. Several states have established an annual “sales tax holiday” for energy efficiency measures by annually allowing a temporary exemption – usually for one or two days – from the state sales tax.<br/>RULES, REGULATIONS and POLICIES<br/>Appliance/Equipment Efficiency Standards<br/>Many states have established minimum efficiency standards for certain appliances and equipment. In these states, the retail sale of appliances and equipment that do not meet the established standards is prohibited. The federal government has also established efficiency standards for certain appliances and equipment. When both the federal government and a state have adopted efficiency standards for the same type of appliance or equipment, the federal standard overrides the state standard (even if the state standard is stricter).<br/>Building Energy Codes<br/>Building energy codes adopted by states (and some local governments) require commercial and/or residential construction to adhere to certain energy standards. While some government entities have developed their own building energy codes, many use existing codes (sometimes with state-specific amendments), such as the International Energy Conservation Code (IECC), developed and published by the International Code Council (ICC); or ASHRAE 90.1, developed by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE). A few local building energy codes require certain commercial facilities to meet green building standards.<br/>Contractor Licensing<br/>Some states have adopted a licensing process for renewable energy contractors. Several states have adopted contractor licensing requirements for solar water heating, active and passive solar space heating, solar industrial process heat, solar-thermal electricity, and photovoltaics (PV). These requirements are designed to ensure that contractors have the necessary knowledge and experience to install systems properly. Solar licenses typically take the form of either a separate, specialized solar contractor’s license, or of a specialty classification under a general electrical or plumbing license.<br/>Energy Efficiency Resource Standards (EERS)<br/>Energy efficiency resource standards (EERS) are state policies that require utilities to meet specific targets for energy savings according to a set schedule. EERS policies establish separate reduction targets for electricity sales, peak electric demand and/or natural gas consumption. In most cases, utilities must achieve energy savings by developing demand-side management (DSM) programs, which typically provide financial incentives to customers to install energy-efficient equipment. An EERS policy is sometimes coupled with a state’s renewables portfolio standard (RPS). In these cases, energy efficiency is typically included as a lower-tier resource.<br/>Energy Standards for Public Buildings<br/>Many states and local governments, as well as the federal government, have chosen to lead by example by requiring new government buildings to meet strict energy standards. DSIRE includes policies that have established green building standards, energy-reduction goals, equipment-procurement requirements, and/or the use of on-site renewable energy. Many of these policies require that new government buildings (and renovated buildings, in some cases) attain a certain level of certification under the U.S. Green Building Council’s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) program. Equipment-procurement policies often mandate the use of the most efficient equipment, including equipment that meets federal Energy Star criteria. Policies designed to encourage the use of on-site renewables generally establish conditional requirements tied to life-cycle cost analysis.<br/>Equipment Certification Requirements<br/>Policies requiring renewable energy equipment to meet certain standards serve to protect consumers from buying inferior equipment. These requirements not only benefit consumers; they also protect the renewable energy industry by keeping substandard systems out of the market.<br/>Generation Disclosure<br/>Some states require electric utilities to provide their customers with specific information about the electricity that the utility supplies. This information, which generally must be shared with customers periodically, usually includes the utility's fuel mix percentages and emissions statistics. In states with restructured electricity markets, generation disclosure policies are designed to help consumers make informed decisions about the electricity and suppliers they choose. A few states that have not fully restructured their electricity markets require generation disclosure by utilities.<br/>Green Power Purchasing Policies<br/>Government entities, businesses, residents, schools, non-profits and others can play a significant role in supporting renewable energy by buying electricity from renewable resources, or by buying renewable energy credits (RECs). Many state and local governments, as well as the federal government, have committed to buying green power to account for a certain percentage of their electricity consumption. Green power purchases are typically executed through contracts with green power marketers or project developers, through utility green power programs, or through community aggregation.<br/>Interconnection Standards<br/>Interconnection standards specify the technical and procedural process by which a customer connects an electricity-generating to the grid. Such standards include the technical and contractual terms that system owners and utilities must abide by. State public utilities commissions typically establish standards for interconnection to the distribution grid, while the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has adopted standards for interconnection to the transmission level. Many states have adopted interconnection standards, but some states’ standards apply only to investor-owned utilities -- not to municipal utilities or electric cooperatives. (Several states have adopted interconnection guidelines, which are weaker than standards and generally apply only to net-metered systems.)<br/>Line Extension Analysis<br/>When a prospective customer requests electric service for a home or facility that is not currently served by the electric grid, the customer usually must pay a distance-based fee for the cost of extending power lines to the home or facility. In some cases, it is cheaper to use an on-site renewable energy system to meet a prospective customer’s electricity needs. A few states require utilities to provide information regarding renewable energy options when a line extension is requested.<br/>Mandatory Utility Green Power Option<br/>Several states require electric utilities to offer customers the option to buy electricity generated from renewable resources, commonly known as “green power.” Typically, utilities offer green power generated using renewable resources that the utilities own (or for which they contract), or they buy renewable energy credits (RECs) from a provider certified by a state public utilities commission.<br/>Net Metering<br/>For electric customers who generate their own electricity, net metering allows for the flow of electricity both to and from the customer – typically through a single, bi-directional meter. When a customer’s generation exceeds the customer’s use, electricity from the customer flows back to the grid, offsetting electricity consumed by the customer at a different time during the same billing cycle. In effect, the customer uses excess generation to offset electricity that the customer otherwise would have to purchase at the utility’s full retail rate. Net metering is required by law in most U.S. states, but these policies vary widely.<br/>Public Benefit Funds<br/>Most public benefit funds (PBFs) were developed by states during the electric utility restructuring era, in the late 1990s, to ensure continued support for renewable energy, energy efficiency and low-income energy programs. These funds are commonly supported through a very small surcharge on electricity consumption (e.g., $0.002/kWh). This charge is sometimes referred to as a "system benefits charge" (SBC). PBFs commonly support rebate programs, loan programs, research and development, and energy education programs.<br/>Renewables Portfolio Standards (RPS)<br/>Renewable portfolio standards (RPSs) require utilities to use renewable energy or renewable energy credits (RECs) to account for a certain percentage of their retail electricity sales -- or a certain amount of generating capacity -- according to a specified schedule. (Renewable portfolio goals are similar to RPS policies, but renewable portfolio goals are not legally binding.) Most U.S. states have established an RPS. The term “set-aside” or “carve-out” refers to a provision within an RPS that requires utilities to use a specific renewable resource (usually solar energy) to account for a certain percentage of their retail electricity sales (or a certain amount of generating capacity) according to a set schedule.<br/>Solar and Wind Access Policies<br/>Solar and wind access policies are designed to establish a right to install and operate a solar or wind energy system at a home or other facility. Some solar access laws also ensure a system owner’s access to sunlight. These laws may be implemented at both the state and local levels. In some states, access rights prohibit homeowners associations, neighborhood covenants and local ordinances from restricting a homeowner’s right to use solar energy. Easements, the most common form of solar access policy, allow for the rights to existing access to a renewable resource on the part of one property owner to be secured from an owner whose property could be developed in such a way as to restrict that resource. An easement is usually transferred with the property title. At the local level, communities use several policies to protect solar access, including solar access ordinances, development guidelines requiring proper street orientation, zoning ordinances that contain building height restrictions, and solar permits.<br/>Solar and Wind Permitting Standards<br/>Permitting standards can facilitate the installation of wind and solar energy systems by specifying the conditions and fees involved in project development. Some local governments have adopted simplified or expedited permitting standards for wind and/or solar. “Top-of-the-stack” permitting (or fast-track permitting) saves system owners and project developers time and money. Some states have capped fees that local governments may charge for a permit for a solar or wind energy system. In addition, some states have developed (or have supported the development of) model wind ordinances for use by local governments.</p><p>3.

The purpose of this category is to increase the installation of individual projects through monetizing the non-economic benefits of distributed generation for the developer. Because the value of those benefits vary in different contexts, these policies can be politically challenging to put in place and technically challenging to design and implement. There is a large body of literature (encompassing the energy field as well as other fields) that discusses the design and implementation of effective market incentives. Specific policy types include:<br/>• Incentives. In the context of this framework, incentives are defined as direct monetary support for specific project development. Incentives, especially in the current economic environment, can be politically challenging to implement and require detailed design to ensure that they are effectively reaching the intended market at levels that spur development without creating over-subsidization. Because of the complications and expense of these types of policies, they are most used and most cost-effective in environments where the market is prepared for project development. There are three primary types of incentives:<br/>• Investment incentives directly alter the first cost of technologies. These incentives can take the form of grants, rebates, or tax incentives, depending on the market needs. Grants are typically applied to larger scale projects and are paid in advance of development, and so target development that would not take place without advance investment. Rebates are most commonly based on equipment purchases and can be applied at the time of purchase or through a post-purchase mechanism. Tax incentives can be deductions or credits, can be applied to entire installations, and are applied after purchase, annually. Tax incentives target development that does not need direct capital investment, but instead prioritizes reduction in pay-back period.<br/>• Production incentives provide payment for electricity produced from the distributed electricity. These are different from net metering because the aim is not to provide the economic value of electricity sold into the grid, but instead, to monetize the indirect benefits of distributed generation and apply that on a production basis to projects. These incentives do not directly remove the challenge of higher first costs, and so are most effective in situations in which those high first costs can be spread over the course of the project lifetime (e.g., where direct priori investment is not a priority). In the last decade, incentives for distributed generation have tended toward the production type, because it assures the public that the investment is resulting in clean energy development (whereas investment incentives have the potential to be invested in projects that do not materialize).<br/>• Feed-in-Tariffs. This incentive type reduces investment risk by providing fixed payments for projects based on the levelized cost of renewable energy generation. This (among other design characteristics) distinguishes feed-in-tariffs from production-based incentives, which are based on monetizing the value of the electricity to the grid or the value to the electricity purchaser.<br/>• Removing Siting Restrictions or Ensuring Broad Market Access. Siting restrictions can be stipulated by local ordinances or home owners associations and designate where solar panels can be placed within the jurisdiction. Twenty-four states currently have laws in place that prevent the restriction of solar facilities on residences (12). Like the current state role in encouraging transparency in permitting policies, these typically legislative policies cost nothing to put in place, but implementation and enforcement can be challenging and costly, depending on the interests of the localities. This is an expansion policy (as opposed to a preparation policy) because the effect of siting restrictions is currently unclear, and to date, market development has not been limited by these types of regulations.<br/>• Streamlined Permitting. Permitting for solar facilities has traditionally been the jurisdiction of localities, but there are some states that also issue permits. In the past two years, both Colorado (13) and Vermont (14) have issued laws regulating state permits for renewable energy systems. Such permitting falls into the market expansion category as a potential follow-on to the development of transparent permitting. However, because of its limited use to date there is little information on effectiveness, potential intended or unintended impacts, or broad applicability, so it is not currently considered a primary policy for developing markets.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div></div></div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>03/29/2013</td><td style="width:100%; word-wrap:break-word;"><div><!--  <input type="image" onclick="deleteEntry('24', 'http://opencaselist.paperlessdebate.com/xwiki/rest/wikis/opencaselist/spaces/UNLV/pages/Bato-Velto Aff/objects/Admin.EntryClass/')" value="Delete" title="Delete" style="float:right;" src="/xwiki/resources/icons/silk/cross.gif" />

Both sides agree the U.S. immigration system is broken. Both would seem to gain from a deal that clears a pathway out of legal oblivion for the nation’s 11 million illegal immigrants. Support is building for a landmark pact. But while negotiations are progressing in both the House and Senate, an agreement is a long way off. As the talks grow more detailed, obstacles to a deal may begin to emerge: &nbsp;Problem #1: The Gang of Eight &nbsp;The first snag lurks in the Senate, where the so-called Gang of Eight has huddled privately since the election in hopes of hammering out a bill. Members have crafted a set of measures that would create a pathway to citizenship for the nation’s estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants within about 13 years while requiring them to register with federal authorities, pay back taxes and fines, learn English and undergo background checks. The deal, both sides agree, would also beef up border security and determine how the future flow of immigrants will be regulated to match the needs of the economy. &nbsp;(MORE: Rand Paul Embraces Immigration Reform) &nbsp;The Gang’s closed conclaves have been marked by Vatican-style secrecy, often a sign of progress in a town where silence is rare. The Gang’s members – Republicans Marco Rubio, Lindsey Graham, John McCain and Jeff Flake, and Democrats Chuck Schumer, Dick Durbin, Bob Menendez and Michael Bennet – have, by all accounts, developed a rapport. “You can tell by the tone of their voices,” says an elected Democrat briefed on the progress of the private talks. &nbsp;But the broad themes are the easy part. The full bill will stretch to hundreds of pages, each peppered with detailed provisions that could spike it. Members bring clashing political imperatives and ideologies to the talks. Rubio, for exam ple, is trying to repair the GOP’s tattered image with Hispanic voters without sparking a backlash among the movement conservatives he’d need in a presidential bid. Graham, who faces a probable primary challenge in 2014, has a habit of basking in the bipartisan spotlight before bolting when negotiations intensify. &nbsp;The measure of the Gang of Eight’s success isn’t whether they are aligned at the start of their talks. It’s whether they are all aligned at the end. &nbsp;Problem #2: The Lobbyists &nbsp;A few years ago, an impasse between the leaders of the Chamber of Commerce and the AFL-CIO helped scupper an immigration-reform bill backed by President George W. Bush. At that time, business and labor could not agree on how many visas to grant low skilled workers who make the construction, agriculture and hotel and restaurant industries hum. The Chamber wanted cheap labor, but didn’t want workers to stay; unions were concerned about protecting citizens’ jobs. Soon after, reform collapsed. &nbsp;This time the two groups have nurtured an unlikely alliance. “There has been a sea change,” says a labor source close to the discussions. Nudged by Graham and Schumer, the two lobbies released a set of shared principles, including one stating that Americans should get “first crack” at available jobs and that businesses should have the flexibility to hire to meet the demands of the market. But history could repeat itself again. The two sides call for a new federal agency charged with setting visa levels, but they have yet to agree on who’s eligible or how the new bureau will work. The issue of future flow has been a stubborn sticking point before. And it is as easy to imagine conservatives balking at efforts to create a new government agency as it is to foresee unions drawing a line at a small number of foreign workers. &nbsp;(MORE: Committee to Save the GOP Says Pass Comprehensive Immigration Reform, Become Inclusive to Gays or Keep Losing) &nbsp;Problem #3: House Republicans &nbsp;Even if Senate negotiators can come up with a package to get 60 votes in the upper chamber, “the question continues to be, how does it get through the House?” says Frank Sharry, an expert on immigration reform. As in the Senate, a bipartisan cluster of eight representatives from across the ideological spectrum have been secretly meeting for months. Congressman Luis Gutierrez, an Illinois Democrat who has long been a leader on immigration reform, is full of praise for the new tack taken by his Republican counterparts. But, he acknowledges, “You still have to put those votes on the board, and that’s going to be a real, real test in the House of Representatives.” &nbsp;For their part, Republicans say the party’s old dogma, which held that illegal immigrants should self-deport and then go to the back of the line, is not viable policy. Even many immigration hard-liners say they want to help shape comprehensive reform. “It’s time for us to belly up to the bar,” says Ted Poe, the Texas Republican who chairs the House immigration reform caucus. But for conservatives, amnesty remains a dirty word. “A bill that’s basically amnesty, that says you’re here and you’re going to be a citizen — those two things are not going to come out of this conservative House,” says Poe. Even citizenship is charged enough that Republican Senator Rand Paul, who gave a speech March 19 backing a path to legalization for undocumented immigrants, avoided using the term. Many House Republicans, including several in the Judiciary Committee through which a bill must pass, have a long history of antipathy to amnesty, and only a grassroots rebellion to fear as next year’s primaries approach. &nbsp;Then there is the reality that even if Republicans were to be widely supportive of amnesty, very few of those new citizens are likely to abandon the Democratic Party anytime soon. “Republicans face a choice: do they ditch their principles and go all out in a failing attempt to outpander Democrats?” asks Rosemary Jenks, director of government relations at NumbersUSA, which advocates for lower immigration levels. “It’s becoming very clear to Republicans in Congress that this is not going to get them the Hispanic vote.” &nbsp;(MORE: The Plight of the “Illegal” Nanny) &nbsp;Problem #4: The Democrats &nbsp;Little discussed but also looming is the possibility that Democrats drag their feet on reform. Liberals will balk if the path to citizenship is too long or too onerous, or if enforcement provisions are too rigid. Many conservatives also suspect that Democratic power brokers, despite their daily hammering of Republicans to get moving on immigration reform, would privately prefer to keep the issue as a cudgel than actually pass a law. Barack Obama “wants to make a bill come out of the Senate that is so far out there that it would never pass, so that he can blame us for not being compassionate and use the issue to take back the House in 2014,” says a House Republican. Even some liberals see this as a plausible scenario. “There’s always a lingering doubt in my mind,” admits one House Democrat. Obama knows that putting his fingerprints on the deal is an easy way to kill it; when a draft of his proposal leaked in the press, he called Republican negotiators individually to apologize. But if negotiations in Congress bog down, he may not be so hands off. &nbsp;By all accounts, negotiators are making genuine progress toward a landmark deal that builds on a foundation laid during its last fumbled attempts. But lawmakers still have to thread a bill through a thicket of obstacles in a bitterly divided Congress. Sources close to the negotiations say they expect both chambers to introduce legislation in early April, giving Congress several months to haggle out a pact before members scatter for their summer recess. It sounds like plenty of time, but it’s not. Immigration will have to jockey for attention this spring with gun control, budgets and a potential grand bargain on tax and entitlement reform. Meanwhile, the human cost of the political stalemate is high. Each day, 1,400 undocumented immigrants are deported.&nbsp;</p><p>The DA is not intrinsic – it’s within the agential ambit of the USFG to do the plan and pass _<br/>Vote no—Vote NEG costs political capital so the impact is inev—The action of the judge voting is a decision in congress<br/>Plan has no political opposition <br/>Dorsi 12 Michael (Fellow, Phillips and Cohen LLP; J.D. Harvard Law School , “Clean Energy Pricing and Federalism: Legal Obstacles and Options for Feed-in Tariffs”, )<br/>Two types of policy design can provide a stable price: first, the government can mandate a fixed price, or, second, the government can permit a market to set a purchase price and pay the difference to the supplier. The latter explains some United States agricultural policies — the government sets a target price, and if the actual price falls below the target price, the government will make up the difference.22 Although these programs obtain a supply determined in part by the market forces and support the farmer regardless of price, they cost the government substantial sums of money, and would not be politically sustainable if the agricultural lobby were not particularly strong.23 The alternative fixed price policy avoids the cost to government, but consumers will react by purchasing less of a product if it must be sold at a high price, and sellers will react by offering to sell less if they must offer at a low price.24 A variant of the former describes the price cap on gasoline established by the Nixon Administration in the 1970s, which resulted in shortages of gasoline and rationing on the basis of who arrived first, which in turn caused memorable long lines at gas stations. A feed-in tariff attempts to operate as a hybrid of these two approaches, taking advantage of the unique regulatory structure of the utility sector to establish a subsidy without the need for a particularly strong lobby.<br/>Solar popular—Jobs shield the link<br/>Kelly, ’11 Future of federal solar programs in doubt¶ By Erin Kelly, USA TODAY Updated 6/28/2011 <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../www.usatoday.com/money/industries/energy/2011-06-28-solar-energy-congress_n.htm" tppabs="http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/energy/2011-06-28-solar-energy-congress_n.htm"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/energy/2011-06-28-solar-energy-congress_n.htm</span></a></span>¶ <br/>The solar industry has an ally in President Obama, who has called for a national clean energy standard that sets the goal of the nation generating 80% of its electricity from clean sources by 2035. Although it's unlikely Congress will approve that ambitious goal, the administration could take steps to help the solar industry by allowing federal agencies to enter into long-term agreements to buy solar power, Resch said.¶ Solar programs also remain popular in the Senate, where Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., fought off House efforts early this year to end the loan guarantee program that helps solar companies secure financing for their projects. Reid last month announced that the Energy Department will provide conditional guarantees for the Crescent Dunes Solar Energy Project in Tonopah, Nev., creating nearly 5,000 jobs in his struggling state, which has the nation's highest jobless rate.¶ Solar lobbyists said they believe the loan guarantee program will survive, although it's not yet clear how much funding it will get this year.¶ McClintock and other conservatives wrote letters in early June asking the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development to end innovative technology loan guarantees and other renewable energy programs. The subcommittee approved $160 million for loan guarantees, far less than the $1 billion sought by the Obama administration but enough to keep the program alive.¶ The future is less certain for the U.S. Treasury program that gives cash grants to solar and other renewable-energy companies. Solar companies can get a grant equal to 30% of the cost of a solar system as an incentive to develop solar projects. It was intended to help companies that were not making enough profit in the sluggish economy to take advantage of a 30% tax credit.¶ Extending the program beyond its expiration date at the end of this year will be tough in the House, because the grant was part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, the stimulus bill passed by the House in 2009 when it was led by Democrats. Republicans say the act spent billions while creating few jobs.¶ "I think we've got a 50-50 chance of getting the grant program renewed," Efird said.¶ Solar advocates say they believe they can change some minds in the House when they point out that there are solar companies in every state.¶ "I think solar is sometimes mistakenly thought of as a small, niche industry when it has actually created jobs all across the country," Caperton said. "It's not just California and Arizona. There are manufacturing companies in Mississippi, Alabama, Michigan, all over the place. When members of Congress hear that, they start to listen, and things start to change."<br/>Plan isn’t percieved<br/>Wise 9 (Andrew S “The illusion of independent regulatory commission independence”, Proquest)<br/>2 In theory, independent regulatory commissions like the FCC and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) were created to provide expert and politically neutral regulation in specialized policy areas. 1 In areas such as telecommunications, regulatory decisions were to be made based on intimate industry knowledge, not politics. The President would appoint the high-ranking officials of these agencies, with the advice and consent of the Senate, and Congress would exercise oversight over whether laws were implemented consistent with congressional intent. In the end, however, the independent commissions would perform the regulatory heavy lifting. It is reasonable to question whether these agencies perform as they were intended to, and whether the incentives operating on the high-level officials of these departments, and on those overseeing these agencies, provide the correct impulses to implement optimum policy. Alternatively, it is reasonable to question whether this idealized picture was or is the intent behind the creation of independent regulatory agencies. This study examines these questions focusing on the performance of the FCC and tests the hypothesis that the environment facing high-level independent commission officials does not provide the proper incentives to promulgate efficient regulations, or even regulations that serve the interests of a significant portion of society. Instead, high-level officials will seek to maximize lifetime income, which will have more to do with creating rents and pleasing congressional oversight committees than good policy.

He and his advisers have calculated that a bill crafted by Capitol Hill stands a better chance of winning Republican support than one overtly influenced by the president. In his interviews Wednesday, Obama tried to stay out of the prickly policy issues that remain unfinished in the Senate talks, though he said a split between business and labor on wages for new low-skilled workers was unlikely to "doom" the legislation. "This is a resolvable issue," he said. The president also spoke Wednesday with Univision. His interviews followed a citizenship ceremony conducted Monday at the White House where he pressed Congress to "finish the job" on immigration, an issue that has vexed Washington for years. The president made little progress in overhauling the nation's fractured immigration laws in his first term, but he redoubled his efforts after winning re-election. The November contest also spurred some Republicans to drop their opposition to immigration reform, given that Hispanics overwhelmingly backed Obama. In an effort to keep Republicans at the negotiation table, Obama has stayed relatively quiet on immigration over the last month. He rolled out his immigration principles during a January rally in Las Vegas and made an impassioned call for overhauling the nation's laws during his early February State of the Union address, then purposely handed off the effort to lawmakers. The president has, however, privately called members of the Senate working group, and the administration is providing technical support to the lawmakers.

In response, the pundits will do what they always do this time of year: They will talk about how unrealistic most of the proposals are, discussions often informed by sagacious reckonings of how much “political capital” Obama possesses to push his program through.¶ Most of this talk will have no bearing on what actually happens over the next four years.¶ Consider this: Three months ago, just before the November election, if someone had talked seriously about Obama having enough political capital to oversee passage of both immigration reform and gun-control legislation at the beginning of his second term—even after winning the election by 4 percentage points and 5 million votes (the actual final tally)—this person would have been called crazy and stripped of his pundit’s license. (It doesn’t exist, but it ought to.) In his first term, in a starkly polarized country, the president had been so frustrated by GOP resistance that he finally issued a limited executive order last August permitting immigrants who entered the country illegally as children to work without fear of deportation for at least two years. Obama didn’t dare to even bring up gun control, a Democratic “third rail” that has cost the party elections and that actually might have been even less popular on the right than the president’s health care law. And yet, for reasons that have very little to do with Obama’s personal prestige or popularity—variously put in terms of a “mandate” or “political capital”—chances are fair that both will now happen.¶ What changed? In the case of gun control, of course, it wasn’t the election. It was the horror of the 20 first-graders who were slaughtered in Newtown, Conn., in mid-December. The sickening reality of little girls and boys riddled with bullets from a high-capacity assault weapon seemed to precipitate a sudden tipping point in the national conscience. One thing changed after another. Wayne LaPierre of the National Rifle Association marginalized himself with poorly chosen comments soon after the massacre. The pro-gun lobby, once a phalanx of opposition, began to fissure into reasonables and crazies. Former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., who was shot in the head two years ago and is still struggling to speak and walk, started a PAC with her husband to appeal to the moderate middle of gun owners. Then she gave riveting and poignant testimony to the Senate, challenging lawmakers: “Be bold.”¶ As a result, momentum has appeared to build around some kind of a plan to curtail sales of the most dangerous weapons and ammunition and the way people are permitted to buy them. It’s impossible to say now whether such a bill will pass and, if it does, whether it will make anything more than cosmetic changes to gun laws. But one thing is clear: The political tectonics have shifted dramatically in very little time. Whole new possibilities exist now that didn’t a few weeks ago.¶ Meanwhile, the Republican members of the Senate’s so-called Gang of Eight are pushing hard for a new spirit of compromise on immigration reform, a sharp change after an election year in which the GOP standard-bearer declared he would make life so miserable for the 11 million illegal immigrants in the U.S. that they would “self-deport.” But this turnaround has very little to do with Obama’s personal influence—his political mandate, as it were. It has almost entirely to do with just two numbers: 71 and 27. That’s 71 percent for Obama, 27 percent for Mitt Romney, the breakdown of the Hispanic vote in the 2012 presidential election. Obama drove home his advantage by giving a speech on immigration reform on Jan. 29 at a Hispanic-dominated high school in Nevada, a swing state he won by a surprising 8 percentage points in November. But the movement on immigration has mainly come out of the Republican Party’s recent introspection, and the realization by its more thoughtful members, such as Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, that without such a shift the party may be facing demographic death in a country where the 2010 census showed, for the first time, that white births have fallen into the minority. It’s got nothing to do with Obama’s political capital or, indeed, Obama at all.¶ The point is not that “political capital” is a meaningless term. Often it is a synonym for “mandate” or “momentum” in the aftermath of a decisive election—and just about every politician ever elected has tried to claim more of a mandate than he actually has. Certainly, Obama can say that because he was elected and Romney wasn’t, he has a better claim on the country’s mood and direction. Many pundits still defend political capital as a useful metaphor at least. “It’s an unquantifiable but meaningful concept,” says Norman Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute. “You can’t really look at a president and say he’s got 37 ounces of political capital. But the fact is, it’s a concept that matters, if you have popularity and some momentum on your side.”¶ The real problem is that the idea of political capital—or mandates, or momentum—is so poorly defined that presidents and pundits often get it wrong. “Presidents usually over-estimate it,” says George Edwards, a presidential scholar at Texas AandM University. “The best kind of political capital—some sense of an electoral mandate to do something—is very rare. It almost never happens. In 1964, maybe. And to some degree in 1980.” For that reason, political capital is a concept that misleads far more than it enlightens. It is distortionary. It conveys the idea that we know more than we really do about the ever-elusive concept of political power, and it discounts the way unforeseen events can suddenly change everything. Instead, it suggests, erroneously, that a political figure has a concrete amount of political capital to invest, just as someone might have real investment capital—that a particular leader can bank his gains, and the size of his account determines what he can do at any given moment in history.<br/>No bill—Even if they have a card, there isn’t even a bill yet—Takes out the internal link</p><p>US-Indian relations low but will never collapse<br/>Padukone 12 (Neil Padukone is the Felow for geopolitics at the Takshashila Institution, 6/19/2012, "Natural Allies?", pragati.nationalinterest.in/2012/06/natural-allies/)<br/>In the late 1990s, the United States and India embarked on a partnership based largely on three strategic issues: markets, counter-terrorism, and balancing China. With the opening of India’s economy in 1991, the United States saw India’s billion-strong population as a massive market for its businesses. In the wake of 9/11, Washington came to see India’s travails against Islamist militants in Kashmir and Afghanistan through the lens of its War on Terror and increased counter-terrorism cooperation with New Delhi. And as India’s and China’s strategic spaces began to overlap, managing China’s rise became a common concern for both New Delhi and Washington. With that in mind, the United States and India reversed decades of enmity and, through the 2006 nuclear deal, embarked upon a symbolic commitment to what heads of state of both countries have called a “natural alliance.” Yet with all the fanfare- particularly after U.S. President Barack Obama voiced his support for a permanent Indian seat on the UN Security Council in his 2010 Lok Sabha speech- bilateral ties have recently been marked by considerable drift: India has not fallen in line on the issue of Iran, Washington is only slowly coming around on Pakistani militancy, the countries’ UN voting records do not mesh, and trade disagreements abound. Questions have been raised over why U.S.-India relations have cooled, or whether they were over hyped in the first place. The U.S. Department of Defense’s “strategic pivot” toward Asia is one way to shore up relations and realign the Indo-U.S. partnership. India’s geostrategic location at the centre of the Indian Ocean- along with its naval expansion toward the southern Indian Ocean and its Port Blair naval base at the Andaman Islands- enable New Delhi to manage China’s presence in the region. Indeed, India and America’s navies have been more coordinated than any other bureaucracy since 2000. But the implications of this shared Beijing-centric orientation will only come about in the medium-term. One dimension of these ties, the sale of defence technologies, is another place where India has not yet delivered: the recent Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MMRCA) competition failed to award contracts to American companies. And in the middle of a global recession in which all countries are hunkering down, and domestic inflation and unemployment- not to mention concerns over doing business in India, such as retroactive taxation and tax avoidance measures- have grown, economic reforms that would further open India’s markets have slowed. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s recent visit to Kolkata was largely an effort to encourage India to increase the speed of its market liberalisation, particularly in the retail sector. This may be a prospect for the future, but is doubtful today given India’s economic slowdown and the attendant drop in employment. Yet perhaps the main reason for this strategic drift is that America’s key concern in South Asia these days is Afghanistan. President Obama delivered on his campaign promise to refocus efforts on the war in that country, and from 2009, his administration’s “AfPak” strategy took a regional perspective that originally sought to bring India into the equation. The thinking behind this, as Amitai Etzioni writes, is that “for Pakistanis, conflict (with India) poses an ominous existential challenge that drives their behaviour on all things,” including “their approach to the West and the war in Afghanistan… If the India-Pakistan confrontation could be settled, chances for progress on other fronts would be greatly enhanced.” The implication was that Washington ought to hyphenate India and Pakistan, to see the two as part of the same regional tussle, and try to settle the Kashmir dispute in order to make progress in Afghanistan. This was something New Delhi vehemently opposed and in fact, it sought de-hyphenation from Pakistan – engagement with New Delhi and Islamabad on separate and unconnected tracks. So when the office of the late US Special Adviser on Pakistan and Afghanistan Richard Holbrooke sought to include India and Kashmir in its purview, New Delhi successfully lobbied against it. This effort served one of India’s aims, insofar as it keeps Kashmir out of America’s area of direct intervention. Yet it also takes India, its assets, and its clout out of the broader Afghan resolution. Among these assets is the Indian-constructed Chabahar Road that connects Iran’s eastern Chabahar Port on the Gulf of Oman to western Afghanistan. The road ends Pakistan’s monopoly on seaborne trade to Afghanistan, which has long allowed Islamabad’s pernicious dominance of Kabul’s economic and political life. In light of America’s confrontation with Iran and efforts to sanction the latter’s energy sector, however, Washington opposes India’s use of Chabahar, particularly to import Iranian oil and natural gas. Indeed another goal of Secretary Clinton’s visit was to try to shore up India’s support for sanctions against Iran- to which end India is reducing its dependence on Iranian energy as it awaits an exemption on sanctions from the US State Department. But when New Delhi recently used its Chabahar road to send 100,000 tons of wheat to Kabul, its full potential vis-à-vis Afghanistan became evident. And this food aid was on top of India’s additional commitments to Afghanistan: constructing the Zaranj-Delaram highway in western Afghanistan that connects Chabahar to the Afghan ring road, the development of the Ayni Air base in Tajikistan (originally designed to treat wounded Afghan soldiers), building Afghanistan’s parliament building, exploring the Hajigak iron mine, and even commitments to train the Afghan National Police and Army- all of which amount to pledges of over $1 billion since 2001. Washington has been wary of encouraging India’s presence in Afghanistan citing Islamabad’s fear of encirclement. But, even without American attention, a refutation of Pakistan’s “India Threat” narrative is already underway. In order to remain focused on strategic horizons beyond South Asia, India is reorienting its defence apparatus away from Pakistan and towards China and the southern Indian Ocean; even the Ayni Base and Chabahar Road can be seen as elements of this strategic shift beyond the subcontinent. Together with Pakistan’s focus on the Durand Line and events within its own borders, political breathing space between Islamabad and New Delhi has opened up. India-Pakistan talks have already produced a number of important breakthroughs that portend better bilateral days to come: the granting of Most-Favoured Nation status, enhanced trade measures, as well as discussions on the specific parameters of a Kashmir peace based on economic integration. Specifically regarding the Indo-Pak dynamic in Afghanistan, things are less zero-sum than they appear. Important as the Chabahar route is, the combination of road, sea, and even rail links still comes with massive transport costs for India-Afghanistan trade. As S Verma, chairman of Steel Authority of India and the head of a consortium of Indian industries engaged in Afghanistan’s Hajigak iron mine, put it, “over the longer term,” transporting Afghan minerals over Pakistani territory “will be a productive investment. Not just for us, but others in the region including Pakistan. There are license fees, logistics, and so forth.” Meanwhile, Kaustav Chakrabarti of the Observer Research Foundation has suggested “deploying joint Indo-Pak nation building teams” in Afghanistan that include advisors, military trainers, bureaucrats, developments experts, medical crews and NGOs. These teams would “provide additional resources, bridge political polarities, foster cooperation between India and Pakistan and devise means to verify each other’s role, and ultimately, present a long-term mechanism,” guaranteed by India and Pakistan’s geographic proximity, “to ensure Afghanistan’s neutrality.” He cites as a precedent the collaboration between Indian and Pakistani armed forces in “UN peacekeeping missions in hot spots like Somalia.” Full realisation of any Indo-Pak promise will require more space, and time, between the two countries. The interim period, meanwhile, may indeed take a cooling period between the United States and India, who are unlikely to become allies in the fullest sense due to differing tactical approaches. But the strategic fundamentals of the Indo-American rapport- balancing China, expanding trade, and stabilising South Asia- remain intact.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div></div></div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>03/29/2013</td><td style="width:100%; word-wrap:break-word;"><div><!--  <input type="image" onclick="deleteEntry('25', 'http://opencaselist.paperlessdebate.com/xwiki/rest/wikis/opencaselist/spaces/UNLV/pages/Bato-Velto Aff/objects/Admin.EntryClass/')" value="Delete" title="Delete" style="float:right;" src="/xwiki/resources/icons/silk/cross.gif" />

That's likely to push domestic prices up by a "moderate" one to eight percent as overseas markets take up some of the abundant supply, creating more attractive market for producers, he said. But by 2035, natural gas could rise to between $4-6 per MMBtu as increased demand from exports combines with more use as a vehicle fuel, declining production, and the rising cost of environmental compliance. Despite some support for US LNG exports, overseas demand for US gas is likely to be limited by increasing production in many countries, notably China, Australia and Qatar, all of which have major reserves of shale gas, Pickering said. As global production increases, the price differential between US and overseas shale gas will come down, he predicted.

The discovery has led to a sense among many that our energy problems are not terribly urgent. Even President Obama referred to a 100 year supply of natural gas in his second State of the Union address. The U.S. is now predicted to become the world’s top oil and gas producer in the year 2017. What those predictions don’t tell is how long the U.S. is expected to remain in that position.¶ According to one expert, that status could be very short-lived indeed. In fact, according to David Hughes, a scientist who spent 32 years with the Geological Survey of Canada, the exceedingly optimistic estimates could be setting us up for a fall, the likes of which we have not seen since the real estate collapse of 2008. Hughes is currently a fellow with the Post Carbon Institute.¶ Shale gas has grown explosively to the point that it now supplies some 40 percent of U.S. natural gas. But the question is, how long can that explosion last?¶ Hughes has noted in his report, Drill Baby Drill that it’s not the amount of gas in situ, but the achievable rate of supply that really matters. It turns out, there are significant constraints to achieving the needed rates for both shale gas and oil. After studying production data for some 65,000 shale gas wells, using the industry standard DI Desktop /HPDI database, Hughes found that the vast majority of these wells are depleted within five years.¶ So although, there is a huge amount of gas and oil sitting there, it will become increasingly difficult, risky and expensive to retrieve those resources as time goes on. The very high rates of decline of these wells will require thousands of new wells to be dug at a cost that could well exceed the value of the energy extracted. In the case of shale gas, Hughes estimates a cost of $42 billion per year as compared to $32.5 billion worth of gas that was produced in 2012.¶ A similar scenario exists with the shale (tight) oil, The two main plays in North Dakota (Bakken/yellow) and Texas (Eagle Ford/brown) are declining rapidly and will require over 1500 new wells annually at a cost of $14 billion, just to offset the declines. Production of this oil is expected to peak in 2017 (the year the US briefly becomes top producer) dropping back within two years to 2012 levels and essentially petering out by 2025. In other words, this whole shale oil bonanza will be a bubble of about ten years’ duration (see graph).¶ Tar sands oil, the raison d’être for the much-opposed Keystone XL pipeline, is likewise troubled. It contains relatively low energy while requiring lots of energy, in the form of steam, to produce. Some estimates claim a cost of as much as $100 per barrel.¶ It is not just Hughes saying this. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) sees U.S. domestic crude oil production including shale oil peaking at 7.5 million barrels per day (mbd) in 2019 (well below the all-time U.S. peak of 9.6 mbd in 1970), and by 2040 the share of domestically produced crude oil is projected to be lower than it is today.¶ At the same time as Hughes’ report came out, Deborah Rogers of the Energy Policy Forum also issued her report, Shale and Wall Street: Was the Decline in Natural Gas Prices Orchestrated?. Rogers is a former investment banker, now the founder of the Energy Policy Forum. According to her report, shale mergers and acquisitions became one of the most profitable areas for Wall St. investment banks, accounting for some $46.5 billion worth of deals. Her report provides evidence that Wall Street promoted the natural gas drilling frenzy (much as it did the housing bubble), by, among other things, conspiring with energy companies to overstate the size of reserves by as much as 4-500% , as well as understating the steep decline rates and highly inefficient nature of these operations. Furthermore, they drove production to unsustainable levels in an effort to drive prices down to encourage investment and manipulate government policy in a direction most favorable to domestic oil and gas production. Because of the debt resulting from these highly leveraged operations, stated reserves may have broken SEC rules in an effort to avoid collateral default.¶ So, it seems what we have here is a conspiracy of misinformation, on the part of energy companies and their Wall Street backers, intended, in the name of short term profit, to lure our economy out onto a branch of the energy tree that is not strong enough to hold its weight.¶ When that branch collapses, prices will suddenly go through the roof, and the result will be much the same as the financial collapse of 2008, only this time the government will be asked to bail out the oil companies.¶&nbsp;</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div></div></div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>03/29/2013</td><td style="width:100%; word-wrap:break-word;"><div><!--  <input type="image" onclick="deleteEntry('26', 'http://opencaselist.paperlessdebate.com/xwiki/rest/wikis/opencaselist/spaces/UNLV/pages/Bato-Velto Aff/objects/Admin.EntryClass/')" value="Delete" title="Delete" style="float:right;" src="/xwiki/resources/icons/silk/cross.gif" />

However, across all state studies, the methodologies used in determining projected electricity rate impacts, environmental effects, and public benefits were limited and failed to account for key costs including:¶ 1. transmission and integration costs for wind energy*, ¶ 2. fluctuating capacity values, ¶ 3. increasing capital costs for the turbines, and ¶ 4. likelihood that coal-fired generation, not natural gas, will drive wholesale market prices in some regions.¶ *The bulk of the renewable generation is expected to be satisfied by wind according to the report.¶ In an interview, Berkeley Lab researcher Ryan Wiser said that "many of the studies were designed with the explicit intent to either influence legislative processes or, alternatively, to potentially affect the design of RPS policies as established by regulatory agencies."¶ The "disparity between study expectations and current market reality suggests that the actual cost impacts of state RPS policies may significantly exceed those estimated in our sample of studies, especially if higher wind costs persist."<br/>RPS fails – Companies would pay the fine rather than switching to Renewables<br/>Jerry Taylor, 2002 director of natural resource studies at the Cato Institute, Evaluating the Case for Renewable Energy Is Government Support Warranted?, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa422.pdf" tppabs="http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa422.pdf"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa422.pdf</span></a></span><br/>The Clinton administration proposed a federal RPS that would require all U.S. electricity suppliers to obtain renewable energy credits equal to 7.5 percent of sales from 2010 through expiration in 2015. Under the administration’s plan, credits could be obtained by generating electricity with specified renewables (one credit for every kilowatt-hour), purchasing credits from others, or purchasing credits unsupported by generation from the Department of Energy at 1.5 cents per credit, effectively setting a cap on the price of renewable energy. Because actual renewable sources of electricity have costs that exceed 1.5 cents per kWh, retail suppliers would for the most part buy credits from the Department of Energy rather than actually purchase or produce renewable energy. The EIA estimated that the Clinton RPS would increase renewables’ market share only to 3.4 percent in 2020.80 Approximately 82 percent of the 36 billion kWh increase in renewable energy would come from mixing biomass (essentially, wood chips, paper, and various specialty plants) with coal in existing coal-fired power plants.81 Removing the 2015 sunset provision would increase the predicted market share for renewables to 4.2 percent.82</p><p>NB-<br/>Adding to the grid lowers electricity prices<br/>Jon Parepoynt, 3-11- 13 (“The Europeanization Of U.S. Utilities Has Begun”, Seeking Alpha Contributor)<br/>¶ According to most state regulations, wind and solar power generation have a guaranteed place on the grid, and utilities are required to buy this electricity. In the case where base loads requirements are satisfied by current base load generation and intermittent generation is high, there will be too much electricity on the grid. There is currently insufficient electricity storage so that the excess can be "banked" for when it is needed, for instance when the intermittent generation is offline.¶ When there is insufficient demand to satisfy both the base load generating capacity and the intermittent generating capacity, utilities have been paying customers to use more electricity.¶ Bloomberg published another article on the topic Sunday night March 10 outlining this exact situation - not in Germany or Denmark, but in the US Midwest. It is titled, "Nuclear Industry Withers in US as Wind Pummels Prices", This article should be necessary reading for all electric utility investors.¶ Prices Below Zero¶ Wind power has two advantages. Green energy laws in many states require utilities to buy wind energy under long-term contracts as part of their clean-energy goals and take that power even when they don't need it. Wind farms also receive a federal tax credit of $22 for every megawatt-hour generated.¶ Thus, even when there is no demand for the power they produce, operators keep turbines spinning, sending their surplus to the grid because the tax credit assures them a profit.¶ On gusty days in the five states with the most wind power - - Texas, California, Iowa, Illinois and Oregon -- this can flood power grids, causing prices to drop below zero during times when demand is light. Wholesale electricity during off-peak hours in Illinois has sold for an average price of $23.39 per megawatt hour since Jan. 1, after hitting a record low of -$41.08 on Oct. 11, the least since the Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator Inc. began sharing real-time pricing in 2005.¶ 'Negative Prices'¶ Meanwhile, nuclear and coal plants must continue running even as this "negative pricing" dynamic forces them to pay grid operators to take the power they produce.</p><p>Solar decentralization solves the grid price spikes<br/>Kristin Bluvas, ‘7 (J.D., Albany Law School, 2007; B.S., Cornell University, 2004, “COMMENT: DISTRIBUTED GENERATION: A STEP FORWARD IN UNITED STATES ENERGY POLICY”, 70 Alb.

This inelasticity of demand response "has been indicted as the chief culprit behind the price spikes, shortages, and charges of market manipulation that have plagued several U.S. electricity markets the past few years." n74 The promotion of homeowner power production through distributed generation (specifically renewable) so that consumers can react to current power prices would help control prices at peak demand times. n75 A generator could be turned on to decrease high-priced power consumption. Nevertheless, this would require a much more transparent market system allowing prices to be viewed easily by consumers.</p><p>No price spikes <br/>Alic, former tech and science consultant – Office of Technology Assessment, adjunt professor – Johns Hopkins SAIS, ‘12 (John, “Defense Department Energy Innovation: Three Cases,” in Energy Innovation at the Department of Defense: Assessing the Opportunities, March)<br/>¶ The Energy Information Administration expects the 12 members of OPEC, which account for some 70 percent¶ of estimated world reserves, to pump slightly more than 40 percent of world oil production over the next several¶ decades.c U.S. oil imports will remain high. At the same time, supplies have become more diversified since the¶ 1970s, and the OPEC cartel weaker. Canada now ships more oil to the United States than does any other nation¶ (followed by Mexico, and only then Saudi Arabia). Domestic output has crept upward in recent years. All these¶ factors tend to argue against a repetition of unexpectedly sudden supply constrictions. So does the dependence of¶ many exporting states on oil revenues as a prop to internal security, by buying off political opponents or buying¶ weapons to suppress them.¶ To some observers, common sense nevertheless seems to imply that dependence on imported oil weakens the¶ U.S. economy, and by extension national security, given that military power depends, if indirectly, on the size¶ and composition of a nation’s economy. These extrapolations from dependence on imported oil to some sort of¶ larger national vulnerability have little foundation in empirically grounded understanding of either economic¶ affairs or military security. Within the analytical framework of economics, weakness and strength are problematic¶ notions, lacking an accepted basis in quantitative measures; governments collect statistics on output, income,¶ and productivity, not “strength.” Trade deficits, furthermore, are usually taken to be derivative of savings and¶ investment, viewed as the fundamental forces driving a nation’s balance of payments. The implication of this more¶ or less standard view is that a reduction in U.S. imports of oil (e.g., from greater domestic output), would simply¶ lead to a rise in imports of other goods and services. Third, the relationships between economic performance and¶ military strength are loose. The Soviet Union, after all, managed to remain a superpower for decades by steering a¶ large share of economic output to its military.¶ The implications of oil imports for U.S. security interests, then, seem oblique.
