Absolutely, say experts, and fixing the problem won't be cheap. While the nation's power infrastructure is referred to as a "grid," suggesting seamless interconnectivity, "the network more closely resembles a patchwork quilt stitched together to cover a rapidly expanding nation," the Washington Post reported. Experts note that the U.S. really doesn't yet face the kind of issues with its electrical infrastructure that left about 670 million Indians without power in what became the largest outage in history. But, at the same time, industry analysts say the nation's grid is definitely showing signs of aging. And, they say, it's stretched to capacity. More often than not, the grid falls victim to decrepitude rather than, say, the forces of nature, as in tornadoes and powerful storms. Nonetheless the grid is beginning to fail, say experts, who fear that such failures that caused blackouts in New York, San Diego and Boston could become ever more common as the country's demand for power grows exponentially. To fix the problem, industry analysts say it will take a multi-billion, multi-year investment if we're to avoid more frequent large-scale outages in the future. More plants needed, but the delivery system is weak "I like to think of our grid much like a water system, and basically all of our pipes are at full pressure now, and if one of our pipes bursts and we have to shut off that line, that just increases the pressure on our remaining pipes until another one bursts, and next thing you know, we're in a catastrophic run and we have to shut the whole water system down," Otto J. Lynch, vice president of Wisconsin-based Power Line Systems, told the Post. The problem in India and similar developing nations with growing pains is one of power generation. The country is stuck with old and aging coal-fired power plants and is meeting resistance internally to atomic plants. Recently, a number of plants shuttered suddenly, leaving customers without power once more. In the U.S., the problem is somewhat different. Though more plants will be needed in the future, to be sure, the larger problem is that the system of delivery is beginning to fail more frequently. The network of steel towers and power lines that span the country, along with the power transmission stations those lines feed, are the "pipes" of the system that Lynch spoke of. Electricity storage is difficult and besides, most electricity, the Post said, is used within a second of it being produced. The system is designed to shunt power to regions where it is most needed, at the push of a button or, in a growing number of systems, when a computer managing the grid senses the need to shift power. The system is further designed to go around bottlenecks or other interruptions that could slow down the electrical flow. Tens of billions needed to update, upgrade power grids Towers themselves are designed to withstand large gusts of wind but increasingly, towers are collapsing when they shouldn't, and that's a symptom of the aging electrical infrastructure, analysts note. "The aging of equipment explains some of the equipment failures that lead to intermittent failures in power quality and availability," says a report by the American Society of Civil Engineers, released earlier this year. "The capacity of equipment explains why there are some bottlenecks in the grid that can also lead to brownouts and occasional blackouts." To keep the country's power grid operational - and reliable - an additional investment of about $107 billion would be needed by 2020, the ASCE said. Once considered an indulgence, electricity is now a necessity for modern life. "Electricity was primarily a luxury when the majority of our grid was built 50, 60 years ago," Lynch told the Post. "Most people didn't require computers to do their jobs every day. They didn't need the Internet access. iPhones didn't need to be charged, and communication was all hard-wired, so you could still make a phone call when the electricity was out."</p><p>Meltdowns are likely after a black-out: an outage will take days to recover- the best plants in the US can last 16 hours without external power<br/>Cappiello, 11<br/>Dina, staff writer, “NRC casts doubt on US reactors’ blackout plans” <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2011/04/29/nrc_casts_doubt_on_us_reactors_blackout_plans/-camp=pm" tppabs="http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2011/04/29/nrc_casts_doubt_on_us_reactors_blackout_plans/?camp=pm"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2011/04/29/nrc_casts_doubt_on_us_reactors_blackout_plans/?camp=pm</span></a></span>, accessed 10/24/12,WYO/JF<br/>The nation’s top nuclear regulator cast doubt yesterday on whether reactors in the United States <br/>AND<br/>it was.

The need to act is urgent if we are to make sufficient and timely progress toward reduced fossil fuel reliance.¶ To best understand the urgency, Part I begins with a look at our current fossil and renewable energy mix in the generation of electricity,5 and then reviews the current and predicted climate change impacts on and threats to us from our energy choices. At stake are several hundred billion dollars of climate change-related damages each year just in the United States—from farming, fishing, and forestry industries increasingly harmed by changing temperature and precipitation patterns; coastlines increasingly threatened by rising sea levels; business and insurance sectors hit by the growing number of extreme weather events; public health increasingly threatened by disease and mortality from over-reliance on fossil-fueled emissions; and national security increasingly at risk from protecting more foreign sources of fossil fuels and from resource-related conflicts resulting in more violence and displaced persons.¶ Unfortunately, as the economic and health costs from fossil fuel emissions have grown so too has the byzantine labyrinth of laws and regulations to be navigated before a renewable energy project can be approved, let alone financed and developed. 6 The root cause goes back to the 1970s when some of our fundamental environmental laws were enacted, before we were aware of climate change threats, to slow down the review of proposed projects by requiring more studies of potential project impacts before approval.7 But in our increasingly carbon-based 21st century, we need a paradigm shift. While achieving important goals, those federal laws and regulations, and similar ones at the state and local levels, have become so unduly burdensome, slow, and expensive that they will chill investment in, and kill any significant growth of, renewable carbon-free energy sources and projects, thereby imposing huge economic, environmental and social costs upon both our country and the world8 unless they are substantially changed. Indeed, by 2050 the U.S. must reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 80% to even stabilize atmospheric levels of carbon, and can do so by increasing generated electricity from renewable sources from the current thirteen percent up to eighty percent9-- but only if there are targeted new policy efforts to accelerate, fifty times faster than since 1990, implementation of clean, renewable energy sources.10<br/>The plan is key to reinvigorate U.S. Environmental Leadership<br/>Schiffer 4 (Lois J., “The National Environmental Policy Act today, with an emphasis on its application across U.S. Borders,” Duke Environmental Law and Policy Forum, Vol. 14:2, 2004, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../www.eli.org/pdf/seminars/NEPA/NEPA Today.pdf)" tppabs="http://www.eli.org/pdf/seminars/NEPA/NEPA%20Today.pdf)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.eli.org/pdf/seminars/NEPA/NEPA%20Today.pdf)</span></a></span> &nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>States and other countries have emulated NEPA.

So what is happening to NEPA as middle age wears on? This article will focus on two conditions of NEPA’s advancing middle age. First, efforts by the Bush Administration to limit this important tool through statutory interpretation, litigation, and legislation to the detriment of the statute and to United States global leadership in environmental issues will be discussed. Then, the influence of NEPA beyond U.S. borders will be considered. NEPA’s influence beyond U.S. borders, sometimes referred to as “extraterritorial application of NEPA,” has long been contentious. It is a helpful case study of NEPA in an increasingly globalized world with growing concern about the United States’ environmental leadership.</em></strong></p><p>U.S. environmental leadership prevents CCP collapse<br/>Economy 7 (Elizabeth, Senior Fellow and Director for Asian Studies – Council on Foreign Relations, “The Great Leap Backward?”, Foreign Affairs, September/October, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/great-leap-backward)" tppabs="http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/great-leap-backward)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/great-leap-backward)</span></a></span><br/>In the view of China's leaders, however, damage to the environment itself is a secondary problem. Of greater concern to them are its indirect effects: the threat it poses to the continuation of the Chinese economic miracle and to public health, social stability, and the country's international reputation. Taken together, these challenges could undermine the authority of the Communist Party. &nbsp;China's leaders are worried about the environment's impact on the economy. Several studies conducted both inside and outside China estimate that environmental degradation and pollution cost the Chinese economy between 8 percent and 12 percent of GDP annually. The Chinese media frequently publish the results of studies on the impact of pollution on agriculture, industrial output, or public health: water pollution costs of $35.8 billion one year, air pollution costs of $27.5 billion another, and on and on with weather disasters ($26.5 billion), acid rain ($13.3 billion), desertification ($6 billion), or crop damage from soil pollution ($2.5 billion). The city of Chongqing, which sits on the banks of the Yangtze River, estimates that dealing with the effects of water pollution on its agriculture and public health costs as much as 4.3 percent of the city's annual gross product. Shanxi Province has watched its coal resources fuel the rest of the country while it pays the price in withered trees, contaminated air and water, and land subsidence. Local authorities there estimate the costs of environmental degradation and pollution at 10.9 percent of the province's annual gross product and have called on Beijing to compensate the province for its "contribution and sacrifice." &nbsp;China's Ministry of Public Health is also sounding the alarm with increasing urgency. In a survey of 30 cities and 78 counties released in the spring, the ministry blamed worsening air and water pollution for dramatic increases in the incidence of cancer throughout the country: a 19 percent rise in urban areas and a 23 percent rise in rural areas since 2005. One research institute affiliated with SEPA has put the total number of premature deaths in China caused by respiratory diseases related to air pollution at 400,000 a year. But this may be a conservative estimate: according to a joint research project by the World Bank and the Chinese government released this year, the total number of such deaths is 750,000 a year. (Beijing is said not to have wanted to release the latter figure for fear of inciting social unrest.) Less well documented but potentially even more devastating is the health impact of China's polluted water. Today, fully 190 million Chinese are sick from drinking contaminated water. All along China's major rivers, villages report skyrocketing rates of diarrheal diseases, cancer, tumors, leukemia, and stunted growth. &nbsp;Social unrest over these issues is rising. In the spring of 2006, China's top environmental official, Zhou Shengxian, announced that there had been 51,000 pollution-related protests in 2005, which amounts to almost 1,000 protests each week. Citizen complaints about the environment, expressed on official hotlines and in letters to local officials, are increasing at a rate of 30 percent a year; they will likely top 450,000 in 2007. But few of them are resolved satisfactorily, and so people throughout the country are increasingly taking to the streets. For several months in 2006, for example, the residents of six neighboring villages in Gansu Province held repeated protests against zinc and iron smelters that they believed were poisoning them. Fully half of the 4,000-5,000 villagers exhibited lead-related illnesses, ranging from vitamin D deficiency to neurological problems. &nbsp;Many pollution-related marches are relatively small and peaceful. But when such demonstrations fail, the protesters sometimes resort to violence. After trying for two years to get redress by petitioning local, provincial, and even central government officials for spoiled crops and poisoned air, in the spring of 2005, 30,000-40,000 villagers from Zhejiang Province swarmed 13 chemical plants, broke windows and overturned buses, attacked government officials, and torched police cars. The government sent in 10,000 members of the People's Armed Police in response. The plants were ordered to close down, and several environmental activists who attempted to monitor the plants' compliance with these orders were later arrested. China's leaders have generally managed to prevent – if sometimes violently – discontent over environmental issues from spreading across provincial boundaries or morphing into calls for broader political reform. &nbsp;In the face of such problems, China's leaders have recently injected a new urgency into their rhetoric concerning the need to protect the country's environment. On paper, this has translated into an aggressive strategy to increase investment in environmental protection, set ambitious targets for the reduction of pollution and energy intensity (the amount of energy used to produce a unit of GDP), and introduce new environmentally friendly technologies. In 2005, Beijing set out a number of impressive targets for its next five-year plan: by 2010, it wants 10 percent of the nation's power to come from renewable energy sources, energy intensity to have been reduced by 20 percent and key pollutants such as sulfur dioxide by 10 percent, water consumption to have decreased by 30 percent, and investment in environmental protection to have increased from 1.3 percent to 1.6 percent of GDP. Premier Wen Jiabao has issued a stern warning to local officials to shut down some of the plants in the most energy-intensive industries – power generation and aluminum, copper, steel, coke and coal, and cement production – and to slow the growth of other industries by denying them tax breaks and other production incentives. &nbsp;These goals are laudable – even breathtaking in some respects – but history suggests that only limited optimism is warranted; achieving such targets has proved elusive in the past. In 2001, the Chinese government pledged to cut sulfur dioxide emissions by 10 percent between 2002 and 2005. Instead, emissions rose by 27 percent. Beijing is already encountering difficulties reaching its latest goals: for instance, it has failed to meet its first target for reducing energy intensity and pollution. Despite warnings from Premier Wen, the six industries that were slated to slow down posted a 20.6 percent increase in output during the first quarter of 2007 – a 6.6 percent jump from the same period last year. According to one senior executive with the Indian wind-power firm Suzlon Energy, only 37 percent of the wind-power projects the Chinese government approved in 2004 have been built. Perhaps worried that yet another target would fall by the wayside, in early 2007, Beijing revised its announced goal of reducing the country's water consumption by 30 percent by 2010 to just 20 percent. &nbsp;Even the Olympics are proving to be a challenge. Since Beijing promised in 2001 to hold a "green Olympics" in 2008, the International Olympic Committee has pulled out all the stops. Beijing is now ringed with rows of newly planted trees, hybrid taxis and buses are roaming its streets (some of which are soon to be lined with solar-powered lamps), the most heavily polluting factories have been pushed outside the city limits, and the Olympic dormitories are models of energy efficiency. Yet in key respects, Beijing has failed to deliver. City officials are backtracking from their pledge to provide safe tap water to all of Beijing for the Olympics; they now say that they will provide it only for residents of the Olympic Village. They have announced drastic stopgap measures for the duration of the games, such as banning one million of the city's three million cars from the city's streets and halting production at factories in and around Beijing (some of them are resisting). Whatever progress city authorities have managed over the past six years – such as increasing the number of days per year that the city's air is deemed to be clean – is not enough to ensure that the air will be clean for the Olympic Games. Preparing for the Olympics has come to symbolize the intractability of China's environmental challenges and the limits of Beijing's approach to addressing them. &nbsp;PROBLEMS WITH THE LOCALS &nbsp;Clearly, something has got to give. The costs of inaction to China's economy, public health, and international reputation are growing. And perhaps more important, social discontent is rising. The Chinese people have clearly run out of patience with the government's inability or unwillingness to turn the environmental situation around. And the government is well aware of the increasing potential for environmental protest to ignite broader social unrest. &nbsp;One event this spring particularly alarmed China's leaders. For several days in May in the coastal city of Xiamen, after months of mounting opposition to the planned construction of a $1.4 billion petrochemical plant nearby, students and professors at Xiamen University, among others, are said to have sent out a million mobile-phone text messages calling on their fellow citizens to take to the streets on June 1. That day, and the following, protesters reportedly numbering between 7,000 and 20,000 marched peacefully through the city, some defying threats of expulsion from school or from the Communist Party. The protest was captured on video and uploaded to YouTube. One video featured a haunting voice-over that linked the Xiamen demonstration to an ongoing environmental crisis near Tai Hu, a lake some 400 miles away (a large bloom of blue-green algae caused by industrial wastewater and sewage dumped in the lake had contaminated the water supply of the city of Wuxi). It also referred to the Tiananmen Square protest of 1989. The Xiamen march, the narrator said, was perhaps "the first genuine parade since Tiananmen." &nbsp;In response, city authorities did stay the construction of the plant, but they also launched an all-out campaign to discredit the protesters and their videos. Still, more comments about the protest and calls not to forget Tiananmen appeared on various Web sites. Such messages, posted openly and accessible to all Chinese, represent the Chinese leadership's greatest fear, namely, that its failure to protect the environment may someday serve as the catalyst for broad-based demands for political change. &nbsp;Such public demonstrations are also evidence that China's environmental challenges cannot be met with only impressive targets and more investment. They must be tackled with a fundamental reform of how the country does business and protects the environment. So far, Beijing has structured its environmental protection efforts in much the same way that it has pursued economic growth: by granting local authorities and factory owners wide decision-making power and by actively courting the international community and Chinese NGOs for their expertise while carefully monitoring their activities. &nbsp;Consider, for example, China's most important environmental authority, SEPA, in Beijing. SEPA has become a wellspring of China's most innovative environmental policies: it has promoted an environmental impact assessment law; a law requiring local officials to release information about environmental disasters, pollution statistics, and the names of known polluters to the public; an experiment to calculate the costs of environmental degradation and pollution to the country's GDP; and an all-out effort to halt over 100 large-scale infrastructure projects that had proceeded without proper environmental impact assessments. But SEPA operates with barely 300 full-time professional staff in the capital and only a few hundred employees spread throughout the country. (The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has a staff of almost 9,000 in Washington, D.C., alone.) And authority for enforcing SEPA's mandates rests overwhelmingly with local officials and the local environmental protection officials they oversee. In some cases, this has allowed for exciting experimentation. In the eastern province of Jiangsu, for instance, the World Bank and the Natural Resources Defense Council have launched the Greenwatch program, which grades 12,000 factories according to their compliance with standards for industrial wastewater treatment and discloses both the ratings and the reasons for them. More often, however, China's highly decentralized system has meant limited progress: only seven to ten percent of China's more than 660 cities meet the standards required to receive the designation of National Model Environmental City from SEPA. According to Wang Canfa, one of China's top environmental lawyers, barely ten percent of China's environmental laws and regulations are actually enforced. &nbsp;One of the problems is that local officials have few incentives to place a priority on environmental protection. Even as Beijing touts the need to protect the environment, Premier Wen has called for quadrupling the Chinese economy by 2020. The price of water is rising in some cities, such as Beijing, but in many others it remains as low as 20 percent of the replacement cost. That ensures that factories and municipalities have little reason to invest in wastewater treatment or other water-conservation efforts. Fines for polluting are so low that factory managers often prefer to pay them rather than adopt costlier pollution-control technologies. One manager of a coal-fired power plant explained to a Chinese reporter in 2005 that he was ignoring a recent edict mandating that all new power plants use desulfurization equipment because the technology cost as much as would 15 years' worth of fines. &nbsp;Local governments also turn a blind eye to serious pollution problems out of self-interest. Officials sometimes have a direct financial stake in factories or personal relationships with their owners. And the local environmental protection bureaus tasked with guarding against such corruption must report to the local governments, making them easy targets for political pressure. In recent years, the Chinese media have uncovered cases in which local officials have put pressure on the courts, the press, or even hospitals to prevent the wrongdoings of factories from coming to light. (Just this year, in the province of Zhejiang, officials reportedly promised factories with an output of $1.2 million or more that they would not be subjected to government inspections without the factories' prior approval.) &nbsp;Moreover, local officials frequently divert environmental protection funds and spend them on unrelated or ancillary endeavors. The Chinese Academy for Environmental Planning, which reports to SEPA, disclosed this year that only half of the 1.3 percent of the country's annual GDP dedicated to environmental protection between 2001 and 2005 had found its way to legitimate projects. According to the study, about 60 percent of the environmental protection funds spent in urban areas during that period went into the creation of, among other things, parks, factory production lines, gas stations, and sewage-treatment plants rather than into waste- or wastewater-treatment facilities. &nbsp;Many local officials also thwart efforts to hold them accountable for their failure to protect the environment. In 2005, SEPA launched the "Green GDP" campaign, a project designed to calculate the costs of environmental degradation and pollution to local economies and provide a basis for evaluating the performance of local officials both according to their economic stewardship and according to how well they protect the environment. Several provinces balked, however, worried that the numbers would reveal the extent of the damage suffered by the environment. SEPA's partner in the campaign, the National Bureau of Statistics of China, also undermined the effort by announcing that it did not possess the tools to do Green GDP accounting accurately and that in any case it did not believe officials should be evaluated on such a basis. After releasing a partial report in September 2006, the NBS has refused to release this year's findings to the public. &nbsp;Another problem is that many Chinese companies see little direct value in ratcheting up their environmental protection efforts. The computer manufacturer Lenovo and the appliance manufacturer Haier have received high marks for taking creative environmental measures, and the solar energy company Suntech has become a leading exporter of solar cells. But a recent poll found that only 18 percent of Chinese companies believed that they could thrive economically while doing the right thing environmentally. Another poll of business executives found that an overwhelming proportion of them do not understand the benefits of responsible corporate behavior, such as environmental protection, or consider the requirements too burdensome. &nbsp;NOT GOOD ENOUGH &nbsp;The limitations of the formal authorities tasked with environmental protection in China have led the country's leaders to seek assistance from others outside the bureaucracy. Over the past 15 years or so, China's NGOs, the Chinese media, and the international community have become central actors in the country's bid to rescue its environment. But the Chinese government remains wary of them. &nbsp;China's homegrown environmental activists and their allies in the media have become the most potent – and potentially explosive – force for environmental change in China. From four or five NGOs devoted primarily to environmental education and biodiversity protection in the mid-1990s, the Chinese environmental movement has grown to include thousands of NGOs, run primarily by dynamic Chinese in their 30s and 40s. These groups now routinely expose polluting factories to the central government, sue for the rights of villagers poisoned by contaminated water or air, give seed money to small newer NGOs throughout the country, and go undercover to expose multinationals that ignore international environmental standards. They often protest via letters to the government, campaigns on the Internet, and editorials in Chinese newspapers. The media are an important ally in this fight: they shame polluters, uncover environmental abuse, and highlight environmental protection successes. &nbsp;Beijing has come to tolerate NGOs and media outlets that play environmental watchdog at the local level, but it remains vigilant in making sure that certain limits are not crossed, and especially that the central government is not directly criticized. The penalties for misjudging these boundaries can be severe. Wu Lihong worked for 16 years to address the pollution in Tai Hu (which recently spawned blue-green algae), gathering evidence that has forced almost 200 factories to close. Although in 2005 Beijing honored Wu as one of the country's top environmentalists, he was beaten by local thugs several times during the course of his investigations, and in 2006 the government of the town of Yixing arrested him on dubious charges of blackmail. And Yu Xiaogang, the 2006 winner of the prestigious Goldman Environmental Prize, honoring grass-roots environmentalists, was forbidden to travel abroad in retaliation for educating villagers about the potential downsides of a proposed dam relocation in Yunnan Province. &nbsp;The Chinese government's openness to environmental cooperation with the international community is also fraught. Beijing has welcomed bilateral agreements for technology development or financial assistance for demonstration projects, but it is concerned about other endeavors. On the one hand, it lauds international environmental NGOs for their contributions to China's environmental protection efforts. On the other hand, it fears that some of them will become advocates for democratization. &nbsp;The government also subjects MNCs to an uncertain operating environment. Many corporations have responded to the government's calls that they assume a leading role in the country's environmental protection efforts by deploying top-of-the-line environmental technologies, financing environmental education in Chinese schools, undertaking community-based efforts, and raising operating standards in their industries. Coca-Cola, for example, recently pledged to become a net-zero consumer of water, and Wal-Mart is set to launch a nationwide education and sales initiative to promote the use of energy-efficient compact fluorescent bulbs. Sometimes, MNCs have been rewarded with awards or significant publicity. But in the past two years, Chinese officials (as well as local NGOs) have adopted a much tougher stance toward them, arguing at times that MNCs have turned China into the pollution capital of the world. On issues such as electronic waste, the detractors have a point. But China's attacks, with Internet postings accusing MNCs of practicing "eco-colonialism," have become unjustifiably broad. Such antiforeign sentiment spiked in late 2006, after the release of a pollution map listing more than 3,000 factories that were violating water pollution standards. The 33 among them that supplied MNCs were immediately targeted in the media, while the other few thousand Chinese factories cited somehow escaped the frenzy. A few Chinese officials and activists privately acknowledge that domestic Chinese companies pollute far more than foreign companies, but it seems unlikely that the spotlight will move off MNCs in the near future. For now, it is simply more expedient to let international corporations bear the bulk of the blame. &nbsp;FROM RED TO GREEN &nbsp;Why is China unable to get its environmental house in order? Its top officials want what the United States, Europe, and Japan have: thriving economies with manageable environmental problems. But they are unwilling to pay the political and economic price to get there. Beijing's message to local officials continues to be that economic growth cannot be sacrificed to environmental protection – that the two objectives must go hand in hand. &nbsp;This, however, only works sometimes. Greater energy efficiency can bring economic benefits, and investments to reduce pollution, such as in building wastewater-treatment plants, are expenses that can be balanced against the costs of losing crops to contaminated soil and having a sickly work force. Yet much of the time, charting a new environmental course comes with serious economic costs up front. Growth slows down in some industries or some regions. Some businesses are forced to close down. Developing pollution-treatment and pollution-prevention technologies requires serious investment. In fact, it is because they recognize these costs that local officials in China pursue their short-term economic interests first and for the most part ignore Beijing's directives to change their ways. &nbsp;This is not an unusual problem. All countries suffer internal tugs of war over how to balance the short-term costs of improving environmental protection with the long-term costs of failing to do so. But China faces an additional burden. Its environmental problems stem as much from China's corrupt and undemocratic political system as from Beijing's continued focus on economic growth. Local officials and business leaders routinely – and with impunity – ignore environmental laws and regulations, abscond with environmental protection funds, and silence those who challenge them. Thus, improving the environment in China is not simply a matter of mandating pollution-control technologies; it is also a matter of reforming the country's political culture. Effective environmental protection requires transparent information, official accountability, and an independent legal system. But these features are the building blocks of a political system fundamentally different from that of China today, and so far there is little indication that China's leaders will risk the authority of the Communist Party on charting a new environmental course. Until the party is willing to open the door to such reform, it will not have the wherewithal to meet its ambitious environmental targets and lead a growing economy with manageable environmental problems. &nbsp;Given this reality, the United States – and the rest of the world – will have to get much smarter about how to cooperate with China in order to assist its environmental protection efforts. Above all, the United States must devise a limited and coherent set of priorities. China's needs are vast, but its capacity is poor; therefore, launching one or two significant initiatives over the next five to ten years would do more good than a vast array of uncoordinated projects. These endeavors could focus on discrete issues, such as climate change or the illegal timber trade; institutional changes, such as strengthening the legal system in regard to China's environmental protection efforts; or broad reforms, such as promoting energy efficiency throughout the Chinese economy. Another key to an effective U.S.-Chinese partnership is U.S. leadership. Although U.S. NGOs and U.S.-based MNCs are often at the forefront of environmental policy and technological innovation, the U.S. government itself is not a world leader on key environmental concerns. Unless the United States improves its own policies and practices on, for example, climate change, the illegal timber trade, and energy efficiency, it will have little credibility or leverage to push China. <br/>Chinese collapse causes CCP lashout with WMD that kills billions<br/>Rexing 5 (San, Staff – Epoch Times, The CCP’s Last Ditch Gamble: Biological and Nuclear War, 8-5, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../english.epochtimes.com/news/5-8-5/30975.html)" tppabs="http://english.epochtimes.com/news/5-8-5/30975.html)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://english.epochtimes.com/news/5-8-5/30975.html)</span></a></span><br/>Since the Party’s life is “above all else,” it would not be surprising if the CCP resorts to the use of biological, chemical, and nuclear weapons in its attempt to extend its life. The CCP, which disregards human life, would not hesitate to kill two hundred million Americans, along with seven or eight hundred million Chinese, to achieve its ends. These speeches let the public see the CCP for what it really is. With evil filling its every cell the CCP intends to wage a war against humankind in its desperate attempt to cling to life. That is the main theme of the speeches. This theme is murderous and utterly evil. In China we have seen beggars who coerced people to give them money by threatening to stab themselves with knives or pierce their throats with long nails. But we have never, until now, seen such a gangster who would use biological, chemical, and nuclear weapons to threaten the world, that they will die together with him.

In June 2008, the House of Representatives approved a resolution introduced by Rahall urging U.S. leadership to use all appropriate measures to end commercial whaling around the globe. The Obama administration has taken a position in favor of continuing the IWC's whaling moratorium. White House Council on Environmental Quality Chair Nancy Sutley said March 6, "The United States continues to view the commercial whaling moratorium as a necessary conservation measure and believes that lethal scientific whaling is unnecessary in modern whale conservation management. The United States also continues to have significant concerns over the recent resumption of international trade of whale meat." "The administration is fully committed to furthering discussions of critical issues within the IWC, including the future of the organization," Sutley said. "While we reserve judgment on various proposals until discussions are completed, it is our view that any package, to be acceptable, must result in a significant improvement in the conservation status of whales," "We recognize some of these issues facing the IWC may require a longer view toward resolution," she said. "However, the failure to resolve these issues is not an acceptable outcome to the United States." <br/>-- IWC checks whaling – risks extinction <br/>Barstow 89 (Robbins, Ph.D., Executive Director – Cetasean Society International, The Magazine of the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society, 2, Autumn, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../www.highnorth.no/Library/Movements/General/be-wh-s2.htm)" tppabs="http://www.highnorth.no/Library/Movements/General/be-wh-s2.htm)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.highnorth.no/Library/Movements/General/be-wh-s2.htm)</span></a></span><br/>My own rationale for asking the IWC to decide to adopt a management regime of permanent protection for whales from consumptive commercial exploitation on a global basis is both simple and complex. It is grounded i pragmatic practicalities of both fact and feeling regarding 'Whales in a Modern World'. I am not here arguing for the sanctity of all life on earth. I am not advocating equal rights for all animal species. I am seeking to set forth a rational and moral basis for a future determination by one, specialised, international, human agency that one order of marine mammals should be managed in this manner. Why whales? My rationale most simply is that whales are uniquely special! They really are in a class by themselves. Let me cite four major categories of uniqueness. First, whales are biologically special. Whales include by far the largest animals on earth, growing to be over 30 metres in length - the blue whale (Balenoptera musculus). Whales include the possessors of by far the largest brain of any creature ever to have lived on our planet, weighing four or five times as much as the human brain - the sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus). Whales include the creators of the most complex, long - lasting, repetitive sound patterns of any non - human animal - the humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae). And whales include species (Tursiops truncatus and some other odontocetes) which exceed humans and all other groups as well in convolutedness or fissurisation of the cerebral cortex. Marine mammal veterinarian Sam Ridgway, of the U.S. Naval Ocean Systems Centre in San Diego, has reported findings that the bottlenose dolphin, in particular, by a variety of measurements (encephalisation quotient, volume of cortex, ratio of brain weight to spinal cord weight, etc.) ranks just below humans and considerably above other higher primates, including gorillas, chimpanzees, and orangutans. In all these ways whales are truly unique biologically! Second, whales are ecologically special. Whales have evolved as marine mammals over millions of years, with both baleen and toothed whales probably appearing up to 25 million years ago, long before the development of human beings and the latter's intrusion in the ocean ecosystem. Whales are at the top of the vast food chain of the sea. Baleen whales consume the largest amount of zooplankton, and the killer whale (Orcinus orca) is the world's greatest non- human predator. Whales affect the ocean ecosystem in a uniquely global manner, and any exploitation of other marine resources, whether krill or fish, must uniquely take into account cetaceans. Human life depends upon a proper balance in the amount of oxygen inn earth's atmosphere produced from the plankton that is kept in check most critically by whale consumption. <br/>The status quo regulatory model should be destroyed- the model the aff would create would be for expedited renewable projects and OSW- that’s a key model to deal with the certainty and timeframes needed for solving warming<br/>Thaler 12<br/>Jeffrey, University of Maine's first Visiting Professor of Energy Policy, Law and Ethics, and Assistant University Counsel for environmental, energy and sustainability projects, “Fiddling as the world burns: How climate change urgently requires a paradigm shift in the permitting of renewable energy projects”, Environmental Law, Volume 42, Issue 4, Forthcoming, p. <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm-abstract_id=2148122" tppabs="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2148122"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2148122</span></a></span> <em>wyo-tjc<br/>The forty-four page 2011 White House Blueprint for a Secure Energy Future omits a critical component: the blueprint does not tackle the issue of streamlining regulatory and permitting processes and requirements for a secure supply of renewable energy.201 This makes the blueprint largely irrelevant to the challenges of preparing renewable energy projects for investment risks, design, regulatory review and construction within the time frames demanded by the climate change crisis.202 Missing are concrete steps that would: 1) Proclaim in laws like NEPA and other major environmental statutes that quickly getting significant numbers of renewable energy projects built is of great strategic importance to the United States, in order to take the needed steps to prioritize and streamline at all governmental levels the regulatory review of such projects; 2) Establish clear, expedited timelines for agency review, consultation and coordination, as well as any judicial review of agency decisions; 3) Develop the expanded use of categorical exclusions under NEPA for offshore wind demonstration, testing and small-scale projects; and 4) Require that the “hidden” costs of fossil fueled energy be taken into account, along with the comparative life cycle impacts of competing energy sources, as part of NEPA’s no-action alternative analysis and other regulatory reviews. Steps to achieve these goals can be undertaken through a combination of federal legislation,203 Presidential Executive Orders,204 and new CEQ and other agency regulations and Memorandums of Understanding.205 Comparable steps have previously been taken for prioritizing fossil fuel energy.206 Given the 21st century exigencies of climate change, the playing field must not just be leveled for renewable clean energy projects, but tilted in their favor.

We must first understand where our carbon-driven energy and electricity technologies are taking us, and learn from the experiences and lessons climate change scientists are trying to teach us, because we are on the verge of losing for the next thousand or more years the environmental and economic quality of life that we inherited.¶ Second, we must understand, in an increasingly carbon-constrained world, how our existing environmental laws and regulatory process no longer achieve their underlying goals of long-term ecosystem conservation. To the contrary, that process is supporting an increasingly greenhouse gas-emitting system that is annually costing trillions of dollars and is reducing the chances of constructing sufficient new pollutant-free and less water-intensive power sources in time to limit average global temperature rise to less than internationally-agreed ceiling of 2⁰C.¶ Therefore, the third step is to act on the evidence presented in Parts I and II to significantly revamp the legal process in order to greatly accelerate development of renewable energy projects like offshore wind power. My recommendations and road map in Part III are a call for climate, economic and energy policymakers to act on needed reforms—to remove the many obstacles in the path of achieving an eighty percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.¶ I acknowledge that my recommendations are only a part of what must be done—but a necessary part.

History has proven that without a strong maritime infrastructure—shipyards, suppliers, and seafarers—no country can hope to build and support a Navy of sufficient size and capability to protect its interests on a global basis. Both our commercial and naval fleets rely on U.S. shipyards and their numerous industrial vendors for building and repairs. The U.S. commercial shipbuilding and repair industry also impacts our national economy by adding billions of dollars to U.S. economic output annually. In 2004, there were 89 shipyards in the major shipbuilding and repair base of the United States, defined by the Maritime Administration as including those shipyards capable of building, repairing, or providing topside repairs for ships 122 meters (400 feet) in length and over. This includes six large shipyards that build large ships for the U.S. Navy. Based on U.S. Coast Guard vessel registration data for 2008, in that year U.S. shipyards delivered 13 large deep-draft vessels including naval ships, merchant ships, and drilling rigs; 58 offshore service vessels; 142 tugs and towboats, 51 passenger vessels greater than 50 feet in length; 9 commercial fishing vessels; 240 other self- propelled vessels; 23 mega-yachts; 10 oceangoing barges; and 224 tank barges under 5,000 GT. 11 Since the mid 1990’s, the industry has been experiencing a period of modernization and renewal that is largely market-driven, backed by long-term customer commitments. Over the six-year period from 2000-05, a total of $2.336 billion was invested in the industry, while in 2006, capital investments in the U.S. shipbuilding and repair industry amounted to $270 million.12 The state of the industrial base that services this nation’s Sea Services is of great concern to the U.S. Navy. Even a modest increase in oceangoing commercial shipbuilding would give a substantial boost to our shipyards and marine vendors. Shipyard facilities at the larger shipyards in the United States are capable of constructing merchant ships as well as warships, but often cannot match the output of shipyards in Europe and Asia. On the other hand, U.S. yards construct and equip the best warships, aircraft carriers and submarines in the world. They are unmatched in capability, but must maintain that lead. 13<br/>U.S. Sea Power is key to deter Chinese hegemony and war in the south china sea<br/>Cropsey, 12<br/>Dr. Seth Cropsey Hudson Institute “The U.S. Navy Shipbuilding Plan: Assumptions and Associated Risks to National Security” <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../www.hudson.org/files/publications/SethCropsey~-~-USNavyShipbuildingPlan~-~-Testimony041812.pdf" tppabs="http://www.hudson.org/files/publications/SethCropsey~-~-USNavyShipbuildingPlan~-~-Testimony041812.pdf"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.hudson.org/files/publications/SethCropsey~-~-USNavyShipbuildingPlan~-~-Testimony041812.pdf</span></a></span>, accessed 12/20/12,WYO/JF<br/>A nation burdened with massive debt whose ability to shape world events has been limited in tandem with its capacity to invest in research and technology will have more and more trouble finding markets. China’s potential hegemony would not only force its neighbors’ to reconsider whether the U.S. is a reliable ally. It would also become an increasingly powerful magnet for trade in the region—at the expense of U.S. commerce. Unlike the U.S. whose seapower has protected global sea lanes that other states have used to their benefit China has a different set of values. It views with suspicion a liberal trading system notwithstanding the benefits received from it. China’s friends include Iran and North Korea. Beijing is a poor candidate to support the international order that has been the keel of U.S. foreign and security policy for a century. Waning U.S. seapower is an invitation that China will regard as a complement to its rising military and navy in particular. It foreshadows a coercive resolution of territorial disputes in the South China Sea, the likelihood of an increased regional arms race, and the troubling international perception that the U.S. is—or has—abandoned its role as a great power. American seapower is the strategic keel of our foreign and security policy. Reducing it would be an exercise of history-making shortsightedness. Restoring it would be an act of statesmanship from which Americans and all who cherish political liberty would benefit for the remainder of this century.

Like the DOD, Europe has made a commitment to renewable energy and set a more ambitious goal of having 20% of its energy consumption from renewable sources by 2020. Each member of the European Union (EU) has a national action plan to achieve this goal, and Europe is well on its way to meeting its objective. In 2009, wind constituted 7.7% of renewable energy sources in Europe. This has also resulted in the creation of over 1 million new jobs, according to a recent report by market research firm EurObserv’ER. One burgeoning market in Europe that the U.S. should emulate is the offshore supply and support vessel industry. Innovative designs for new support vessels, such as catamarans and crew-transfer vessels that can perform well in high-sea states, have come online and can be deployed rapidly to new and existing offshore wind farms. One U.K. company is building 25 crew-transfer vessels a year. Smart U.K. boat builders that are working in the offshore wind industry have also entered into licensing agreements with U.S. boat builders, which not only will bring jobs to a flagging industry, but also should enhance support for offshore wind. Similarly, European port owners and operators are reaping the benefits of offshore wind farm projects. How European ports have positioned themselves as “epicenters” of offshore wind operations and support bases is discussed at length in the September 2011 issue of North American Windpower (“U.S. Ports Model Themselves After European Counterparts,” page 50). Instead of working to stymie offshore wind farms for fear of interference with shipping traffic, U.S. ports should focus on the new jobs and financial opportunities that would be created by similar projects in the U.S. To ensure that these high-tech, high-paying jobs come to the U.S., it requires leadership at the federal and state levels. The U.S. should do what it can to bring about the development of this clean industry, and not sit by while other regions such as the EU, India and China take over what could be a strong manufacturing base and job market for years to come.</em></p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div></div></div></td></tr></table><!--
