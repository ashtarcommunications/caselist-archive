Connecting the Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean, it lacks imposing geographical features like the Rock of Gibraltar or the Golden Gate Bridge. In an energy-conscious world, however, it may possess greater strategic significance than any passageway on the planet. Every day, according to the U.S. Department of Energy, tankers carrying some 17 million barrels of oil — representing 20 percent of the world’s daily supply — pass through this vital artery.<br/>So last month, when a senior Iranian official threatened to block the strait in response to Washington’s tough new economic sanctions, oil prices instantly soared. While the U.S. military has vowed to keep the strait open, doubts about the safety of future oil shipments and worries about a potentially unending, nerve-jangling crisis involving Washington, Tehran and Tel Aviv have energy experts predicting high oil prices for months to come, meaning further woes for a slowing global economy.<br/>The Strait of Hormuz is, however, … to fight in such locales.&nbsp;</p><p>Russia war causes extinction<br/>Helfand and Pastore 09 – (3/31/09, Ira Hefland, MD, former President of Physicians for Social Responsibility, current Vice President of the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, and John Pastore, MD, former U.S. Government medical officer assigned to the Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission in Hiroshima, former Executive Secretary of the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War when that organization was awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace, former President of Physicians for Social Responsibility, “Ira Helfand/John Pastore: U.S.-Russia nuclear war still a threat,” <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../www.projo.com/opinion/contributors/content/CT_pastoreline_03-31-09_EODSCAO_v15.bbdf23.html)" tppabs="http://www.projo.com/opinion/contributors/content/CT_pastoreline_03-31-09_EODSCAO_v15.bbdf23.html)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.projo.com/opinion/contributors/content/CT_pastoreline_03-31-09_EODSCAO_v15.bbdf23.html)</span></a></span></p><p>President Obama and Russian President … in 1995 remains in place today.</p><p>AT: Solves Heg</p><p>Merely having the potential to become independent is a better form of leverage than actually developing domestic resources<br/>Hulbert 11 – (11/10/11, Matthew, Lead Analyst at European Energy Review and consultant to a number of governments, most recently as Senior Research Fellow, Netherlands Institute for International Relations, former Senior Research Fellow at ETH Zurich working on energy and political risk, MPhil in international relations from Cambridge University, “Why "energy independence" means less power for the US, not more,” <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../www.europeanenergyreview.eu/site/pagina.php-id=3428)" tppabs="http://www.europeanenergyreview.eu/site/pagina.php?id=3428)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.europeanenergyreview.eu/site/pagina.php?id=3428)</span></a></span></p><p>Given its nearest neighbours aren’t … players to take politically seriously.</p><p>AT: Spending Bad</p><p>No impact – measuring outlays by percentage GDP is wrong.<br/>Bandow 11 – (1/31/11, Doug, senior fellow at the Cato Institute, former special assistant to President Reagan and the author of several books, “Solving the Debt Crisis: A Military Budget for a Republic,” <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../www.cato.org/publications/commentary/solving-debt-crisis-military-budget-republic)" tppabs="http://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/solving-debt-crisis-military-budget-republic)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/solving-debt-crisis-military-budget-republic)</span></a></span>&nbsp;</p><p>Indeed, U.S. security guarantees … must be on the cutting block.&nbsp;</p><p>No impact to cuts.<br/>Bandow 10 – (1/19/10, Doug, senior fellow at the Cato Institute, former special assistant to President Reagan and the author of several books, “Military Spending — For What?” Cato Institute, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../www.cato.org/pub_display.php-pub_id=11143" tppabs="http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=11143"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=11143</span></a></span>&nbsp;</p><p>The United States dominates … determined by its foreign policy.</p></div></div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>10/22/2012</td><td style="width:100%; word-wrap:break-word;"><div><!--  <input type="image" onclick="deleteEntry('16', 'http://opencaselist.paperlessdebate.com/xwiki/rest/wikis/opencaselist/spaces/Harvard/pages/Herman-Tandet Neg/objects/Admin.EntryClass/')" value="Delete" title="Delete" style="float:right;" src="/xwiki/resources/icons/silk/cross.gif" />

In the case cited above, the precautionary principle suggests that the burden of proof could shift onto the proto- developer to show ‘no reasonable environmental harm’ to such sites or processes, before development of any kind could proceed. This is the reversal of the normal position where it is up to the opponents of development to show likely and unreasonable harm (Cameron and Wade-Gery, 1992). Such a reversal of the liability rule would be truly radical and difficult to implement since it would involve some definition of ‘harmfulness’ (or if the burden is to be reversed completely, some measure of ‘harmlessness’). In effect such an arrangement would mean imposing a ‘duty of environmental care’ on all developers, as proposed by Costanza and Cowell (1992). This might carry a requirement to provide an ‘up-front’ compensation fund to pay out ‘no fault’ liability claims, subject to independent verification and arbitration.</p><p>Topical action has to be immediate <br/>Summers 94 - Justice, Supreme Court of Oklahoma, 11-8-1994, “Kelsey v.

Slavery, the cruelties of colonial empires and imperial frontier justice were the lies of civilization and denied native cultural hybridity and liberty. The notions of global empire sovereignty, however, are the new truth games of native traditions, casinos, constitutions, and economic globalization.<br/>Native Americans have been the subject of empire and mission lies from the first instance of contact and the conceits of discovery. Europeans, by word and image, created simulations of natives in the cultural binaries of savagism and civilization. The first pervasive lie of discovery was the invention of the indian, and that monotheistic lie has been compounded in truth games as a singular name for thousands of distinct native cultures.<br/>These rather obvious points are made to connect the practice of colonial deception and the promise of moral games of truth with the constitutional renunciation of native rights on the hybrid frontier of the United States of America.<br/>The American Indian is a brand culture, a dubious, customary simulation of distinct <br/>AND<br/>commercial truth game, and without a trace of resistance or apparent irony.<br/>Mark Taylor noted in The Moment of Complexity that our "extraordinary complexity" in the modern world has exhausted the strategies to interpret experience. There is a "widespread consensus that the most pressing critical challenge is to find ways to resist systems and structures that totalize by repressing otherness and by reducing differences to same."<br/>These "hegemonic structures," he pointed out, "must be 123 subverted or overturned by soliciting the return of repressed otherness and differences in a variety of guises."35<br/>Indian casinos are strategies of survivance, an incredible subversion of "hegemonic structures," but avarice is an odious disguise, and with no manner or remorse for the repression of native ethics and liberty. The mercenary sovereignty and politics of casino money is a truth game that might overturn the honor and assurance of native transmotion and visionary sovereignty.<br/>States, cities, companies, and now reservations, are concerned about brand recognition. "The unbranded state has a difficult time attracting economic and political attention. Image and reputation are thus becoming essential parts of the state’s strategic equity," wrote Peter van Ham in ForeignAffairs." Although no doubt unsettling to conservative thinkers, this is actually a positive development, since state branding is gradually supplanting nationalism."36<br/>Indian casinos dare not invite revisions of brand simulations of natives because the truism of gaming rights on treaty reservations could be abrogated by the plenary power doctrine of the United States Congress. In other words, the money comes by the historical contradictions of brand name simulations and the federal exclaves of nationalism. Casinos have contrived new fugitives of dominance in a truth game of sovereignty.<br/>Convictions, on the other hand, "are more dangerous enemies of truth than lies," asserted Friedrich Nietzsche in Human, All Too Human. He pointed out that "lying demands invention, dissimulation, and good memory" and mused that the "beast in us wants to be lied to; morality is an official lie told so that it shall not tear us to pieces."37<br/>Natives might have shared the view that moral convictions on the frontier were dangerous, but surely not more treacherous than the denial of human rights on the continent. Natives who lost their transmotion and liberty on the frontier were doubly tormented by monotheistic convictions and the truth games of the United States Constitution.<br/>"Everyday life contains many truth games," wrote John Forrester in Truth Games. "The social processes and institutions that establish power, expertise, and authority also generate truths," and the games of truth. "From the sheer diversity, resilience, and efficiency of the thousands of languages people use, it is clear that language has very little to do with truth."<br/>Moreover, lying "is always distinguished from error or falsity by its deliberateness," <br/>AND<br/>dynamics of all such mirroring encounters with the other, the native."38<br/>Natives are the subject of incessant, duplicitous truth games, the scientific, linguistic, ethnographic, and institutional objects of knowledge and political power. Natives, once a hybrid presence in the hemisphere, have become the absent object of various truth games, the fugitives of simulations, and the romantic promise of absence and eternal exile. 125 National covenants and the truth games of institutions proscribed a native presence as brand cultures on the continent.<br/>The conception of truth games was derived from the original philosophical ideas of Michel Foucault <br/>AND<br/>can put themselves in place and be linked to relationships of power."39<br/>Foucault raised three "traditional problems" of humanism, ethics, and models of freedom, in Technologies of the Self. First, what are the "relations we have to truth through scientific knowledge, to those ’truth games’ which are so important in civilization and in which we are both subject and object?" Second, what are the "relationships we have to others through those strange strategies and power relationships?" Third, what are the "relationships between truth, power, and self?"40</p><h4 id="HThesuddendiscoveryoftribalheritageisnotthepassporttoknowledgethatthe1ACclaims2013the22IndianBadge22ispartandparcelofacommodificationandacademicizationoftriballifethatobscurestheactualsurvivanceofindigenousandcausesitsownformofamnesia" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>The sudden discovery of tribal heritage is not the passport to knowledge that the 1AC claims – the "Indian Badge" is part and parcel of a commodification and academicization of tribal life that obscures the actual survivance of indigenous and causes its own form of amnesia</span></h4><p><strong>Vizenor ’94</strong> (Gerald, Distingished Prof. of American Studies @ U. of New Mexico, Prof. Emeritus, U. of California, Berkeley, Manifest Manners, pp. 60-62)<br/>The concerted creations of tribal cultures are in continuous translations as stories, and the situation of hermeneutics remains the same in simulations; the silence of heard stories in translations, and the absence of the heard, antecedes a presence in the shadows of names.<br/>Has the absence of the heard in tribal stories turned to the literatures of dominance?

There are even a few who believe that the nuclear waste issue is so unsolved, that we should not build any new nuclear plants until we solve this problem – as though the problem actually exists in reality rather than just politically.<br/>Most of what we hear in the media about nuclear wastes is wrong, with minor glimmers of truth. It is intended to be frightening. Even the Yucca site is merely a political sideshow for Nevada politicians and others, to posture and grandstand. The issue, as it is dealt with by the media and Special Interest Factions, is totally devoid of perspective and the necessary epidemiological data to place it in any ranking of comparable social risks. Such data exist, even on this site, but are studiously and strenuously ignored by these critics. We continually hear other such emotionally loaded statements that spent fuel, the most highly radioactive ‘nuclear waste’ and its disposal is: 1 An unsolved problem 2. Dangerously radioactive for millions of years 3. A threat to the health of future generations 4. A proliferation threat 5.
