In a widely cited essay that appeared in The Atlantic this May, Simon Johnson, former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, wrote: "The conventional wisdom among the elite is still that the current slump 'cannot be as bad as the Great Depression.' This view is wrong. What we face now could, in fact, be worse than the Great Depression."<br/>Others predicted that these economic shocks would lead to political instability and violence in the worst-hit countries. At his confirmation hearing in February, the new U.S. director of national intelligence, Adm. Dennis Blair, cautioned the Senate that "the financial crisis and global recession are likely to produce a wave of economic crises in emerging-market nations over the next year." Hillary Clinton endorsed this grim view. And she was hardly alone. Foreign Policy ran a cover story predicting serious unrest in several emerging markets.<br/>Of one thing everyone was sure: nothing would ever be the same again. Not the financial industry, not capitalism, not globalization.<br/>One year later, how much … have not materialized at all.<br/>A key measure of fear and fragility is the ability of poor and unstable countries to borrow money on the debt markets. So consider this: the sovereign bonds of tottering Pakistan have returned 168 percent so far this year. All this doesn't add up to a recovery yet, but it does reflect a return to some level of normalcy. And that rebound has been so rapid that even the shrewdest observers remain puzzled. "The question I have at the back of my head is 'Is that it?' " says Charles Kaye, the co-head of Warburg Pincus. "We had this huge crisis, and now we're back to business as usual?"<br/>This revival did not happen because markets managed to stabilize themselves on their own. Rather, governments, having learned the lessons of the Great Depression, were determined not to repeat the same mistakes once this crisis hit. By massively expanding state support for the through central banks and national treasuries—they buffered the worst of the damage. (Whether they made new mistakes in the process remains to be seen.) The extensive social safety nets that have been established across the industrialized world also cushioned the pain felt by many. Times are still tough, but things are nowhere near as bad as in the 1930s, when governments played a tiny role in national economies.<br/>It's true that the massive state interventions of the past year may be fueling some new bubbles: the cheap cash and government guarantees provided to banks, companies, and consumers have fueled some irrational exuberance in stock and bond markets. Yet these rallies also demonstrate the return of confidence, and confidence is a very powerful economic force. When John Maynard Keynes described his own prescriptions for economic growth, he believed government action could provide only a temporary fix until the real motor of the economy started cranking again—the animal spirits of investors, consumers, and companies seeking risk and profit.<br/>Beyond all this, though, I believe … more deeply connected global system.<br/>Managers in Arkansas can work with suppliers in Beijing on a real-time basis. The production of almost every complex manufactured product now involves input from a dozen countries in a tight global supply chain. And the consequences of connectivity go well beyond economics. Women in rural India have learned through satellite television about the independence of women in more modern countries. Citizens in Iran have used cell phones and the Internet to connect to their well-wishers beyond their borders.

One of the marketing bullets being used is that natural gas is newly abundant and can thus be considered a reliable, long term energy option.<br/>I indicated that I was skeptical about that scenario since the “abundance” of gas is something that can quickly disappear if demand picks up and as reduced drilling activity changes the amount of gas that is actually extracted from deep underground tight gas formations (classified now as proven reserves) each month.<br/>I neglected to include another large factor in my previous discussion. Part of my motivation for talking about the possibility that the natural gas marketers are going to be proven to be liars when it comes to supply abundance is that I am certain that nuclear energy is a better long term solution. It is one that should not be pushed off just because gas looks cheap – as long as you can forget the fact that it was selling for about three times as much as today’s price just 15 months ago.<br/>However, I am not the only … sage energy price prediction geniuses.</p><p>Russia’s gas dominance is the lifeblood of its economy-oil can’t compensate<br/>Lindsay Wright 9, contributor to the … Gazprom’s pipelines crisscrossing the continent.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>Russian economic decline causes nuclear war<br/>FILGER 2009 (Sheldon, author and blogger for the Huffington Post, “Russian Economy Faces Disastrous Free Fall Contraction” <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../www.globaleconomiccrisis.com/blog/archives/356)" tppabs="http://www.globaleconomiccrisis.com/blog/archives/356)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.globaleconomiccrisis.com/blog/archives/356)</span></a></span><br/>In Russia historically, economic health … is its least dangerous consequence.</p><p>-- 1NR -- <br/>DoD providing a market revives the entire US SMR industry<br/>Andres and Breetz 11 (Richard B.

This is one foreign policy achievement for which U.S. President Obama can justifiably feel proud. Since the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991, all U.S. presidents have tried to forge better relations with Moscow, but usually with little success. The old Cold War confrontation was quickly replaced by a feeling of mutual resentment. The Russians objected to what they saw as America's encroachment into their old sphere of influence, as Nato kept expanding into Eastern Europe. And the U.S., in turn, fretted about the alleged absence of democratic reforms in Moscow. Relations sunk to their lowest ebb when Russian troops invaded Georgia in August 2008, a conflict exacerbated by miscalculations in both Moscow and Washington. But by the time Obama came to power, many of these disputes were already over. Nato's expansion into the former Soviet republics reached its natural conclusion, while in Russia, Medvedev, a politician who believes in diplomacy, took over from Vladimir Putin, now Prime Minister, who instinctively opted for confrontation. Obama identified a “reset” in U.S.-Russian relations as one of his chief foreign policy objectives. He cancelled plans to build U.S. missile defense installations in Europe, to Moscow's great delight. And he swiftly re-launched nuclear disarmament talks. There were hiccups on the way. Obama's sudden tilt towards Russia alarmed some European countries, who feared that their security interests would be sacrificed. A nuclear disarmament deal proved difficult to negotiate, and still has to be ratified by the U.S. Congress. And Obama himself committed a gaffe when, during his first official visit to Moscow early last year, he made disparaging remarks about Putin, who continues to exercise considerable influence. But ultimately, Obama's strategy has worked because, as Sergey Rogov, who heads Russia's Institute for the U.S. and Canadian Studies, points out, Russian officials were persuaded that Washington had truly abandoned its “paternalistic tone towards Moscow.” As a result, Russia swung behind the U.S. in adopting sanctions against Iran, and this ensured that China also accepted the need for sanctions. However, the U.S.-Russian rapprochement has only begun. Although bilateral trade has doubled during the past year, it still stands at a puny US$24 billion, less than America's trade with Taiwan, and a mere fraction of the total value of America's trade with China, a figure which is 15 times larger.&nbsp;</p><p>That escalates to nuclear war<br/>Cohen 10—prof, Russian Studies and History, NYU.

This issue, the fundamental, underlying conflict in U.S.-Russian relations, needs to be rethought and openly discussed. The United States had and has spheres of influence. We had the Monroe Doctrine in Latin America and tacitly cling to it even today. More to the point, the expansion of NATO is, of course, an expansion of the American sphere of influence, which brings America's military, political, and economic might to new member countries. Certainly, this has been the case since the 1990s, as NATO expanded across the former Soviet bloc, from Germany to the Baltic nations. All of these countries are now part of the U.S. sphere of influence, though Washington doesn't openly use this expression. So American policy is this: The United States can have spheres of influence but Russia cannot, not even in its own security neighborhood. Moscow understands this, and has reacted predictably. If U.S. policymakers and their accommodating media really care about American national security, which requires fulsome Russian cooperation in many areas, they would rethink this presumption. Instead, leaders like Senator McCain and Vice President Biden repeatedly visit Tblisi and Kiev to declare that Russia is not entitled to influence in those capitals while trying to tug those governments into NATO. Unless we want a new, full-scale cold war with Russia, we must ask what Moscow actually wants in former Soviet republics like Georgia and Ukraine. There are, of course, Russian political forces that would like to restore them to their Soviet status under Moscow’s hegemony. But for the Kremlin leadership, from Putin to Medvedev, their essential demand is an absence of pro-American military bases and governments in those neighboring countries. In a word, that they not become members of NATO. Is that unreasonable? Imagine Washington’s reaction if pro-Russian bases and governments suddenly began appearing in America's sphere, from Latin America and Mexico to Canada. Of course, there has been no such discussion in the United States. And that has created the fourth major conflict with Russia since 1991: Moscow's perception that U.S. policy has been based on an unrelenting, triumphalist double standard, as it has been. Washington can break solemn promises, but Moscow cannot. The United States can have large and expanding spheres of influence, but Russia can have none. Moscow is told to make its vast energy reserves available to all countries at fair-market prices, except to those governments Washington has recruited or is currently recruiting into NATO, such as the Baltics, Ukraine, and Georgia, which Moscow should supply at sharply below-market prices. Moscow is asked to support Washington's perceived national interests in Iraq, Iran, and Afghanistan, but without considering that Moscow may have legitimately different security or economic interests in those places. And so it goes. Journal: What have been the consequences of this attitude toward Russia? Cohen: I think we've had an omen: the so-called "Russian-Georgian" war in August 2008. It's called the "Russian-Georgian" war, but was also a proxy American-Russian war. Washington created Saakashvili's Georgian regime and continues to support it. Washington created his fighting force and supplied it with American military minders. American leaders were in Tblisi in the days and weeks leading up to the war. Georgia fired the first shots, as the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) has confirmed. And since then Washington and the mainstream U.S. media have made excuses for what Georgia did by blaming Russia. What they should be focusing on instead is that this was the first ever American-Russian proxy war on Russia's own borders, potentially the most dangerous moment in American-Russian relations since the Cuban Missile Crisis. What would have happened, for example, if an American with or near Saakashvili's forces had been killed by the Russians? There would have been clamor in the United States for military retaliation. Or if Moscow thought, as it seemed to have at first, that the Georgian attack on South Ossetia would be backed by NATO forces if necessary? In July 2009, President Obama went to Moscow and told President Medvedev that Russia was a co-equal great power with legitimate national interests, implying that Washington's reckless policy that led to the Georgian war would end. A few days later, an American warship sailed into a Georgian port. Moscow wondered who sent it, and who is running current U.S. policy. Journal: Is the current U.S. policy toward Russia putting us in greater danger than during the Cold War? Cohen: The real concern I have with this "we won the Cold War" triumphalism is the mythology that we are safer today than we were when the Soviet Union existed. Though it is blasphemous to say so, we are not safer for several reasons, one being that the Soviet state kept the lid on very dangerous things. The Soviet Union was in control of its nuclear and related arsenals. Post-Soviet Russia is "sorta" in control, but "sorta" is not enough. There is no margin for error. Reagan's goal in the 1980s was not to end the Soviet Union, but to turn it into a permanent partner of the United States. He came very close to achieving that and deserves enormous credit. He did what had to be done by meeting Gorbachev half-way. But since 1991, the arrogance of American policymaking toward Russia has either kept the Cold War from being fully ended or started a new one. The greatest threats to our national security still reside in Russia. This is not because it's communist, but because it is laden with all these nuclear, chemical, and biological devices—that’s the threat. The reaction of the second Bush administration was to junk decades of safe-guarding agreements with Moscow. It was the first time in modern times that we have had no nuclear control reduction agreement with the Russians. What should worry us every day and night is the triumphalist notion that nuclear war is no longer possible. It is now possible in even more ways than before, especially accidental ones. Meanwhile, the former Soviet territories remain a Wal-Mart of dirty material and know-how. If terrorists ever explode a dirty device in the United States, even a small one, the material is likely to come from the former Soviet Union. The Nunn-Lugar Act (1992) was the best program Congress ever enacted to help Russia secure its nuclear material and know-how, a major contribution to American national security. But no one in Washington connects the dots. Take Senator Lugar himself. He seems not to understand that we need Russia's complete cooperation to make his own legislation fully successful, but he repeatedly speaks undiplomatically, even in ugly ways, about Russia’s leaders, thereby limiting their cooperation and undermining his own legacy. In other words, to have a nuclear relationship with Russia that will secure our national security, we must have a fully cooperative, trusting political relationship with Moscow. That’s why all the talk about a replacement for the expired START agreement, which Obama has been having trouble reaching with the Kremlin, is half-witted. Even if the two sides agree, and even if the Senate and Russian Duma ratify a new treaty, the agreement will be unstable because the political relationship is bad and growing worse. Evidently, no one in the Administration, Congress, or the mainstream media, or, I should add in the think tanks, can connect these dots.&nbsp;</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>complexity<br/>Predictions are good enough to … sets the bar too high<br/>Chernoff 9 (Fred, Prof. IR and Dir.

P. 161.<br/>In the end, there may be no alternative to relying on the judgment of other human beings, and this judgment is difficult to form in the absence of empirical findings. However, instead of clinging to the elusive idea of a uniform standard for the empirical validation of theories, it is possible to simply present a set of observational statements—whether we call it "data" or "narrative"—for the modest purpose of rendering an explanation or interpretation more plausible than the audience would allow at the outset. In practice, this is precisely what the most committed positivists and inter-pretivists have been doing anyway; the presentation of "logically consistent" hypotheses "supported by data" and the ordering of facts in a "thick" narrative are both ultimately designed to convince scholars that a particular proposition should be taken more seriously than others. Social analysis is not about final truths or objective realities, but nor does it have to be a meaningless world of incommensurable theories where anything goes. Instead, it can be an ongoing collective endeavor to develop, evaluate, and refine general inferences—be they in the form of models, partial explanations, descriptive inferences, or interpretations—in order to render them more "sensible" or "plausible" to a particular audience. In the absence of a consensus on the possibility and desirability of a full-blown explanatory science of international and social life, it is important to keep as many doors open as possible. This does not require us to accept each and every claim without some sort of validation, but perhaps the community of scholars can be more tolerant about the kinds of empirical referents and logical propositions that are employed in validating propositions by scholars embracing all but the most extreme epistemological positions.</p><p>Complexity theory useless for policy making<br/>Cairney 10<br/>(Paul, Chair in Politics and Public Policy¶ BA (Hons), MSc, PhD at Aberdeen University, “Complexity Theory in Public Policy” <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../www.psa.ac.uk/journals/pdf/5/2010/121_665.pdf" tppabs="http://www.psa.ac.uk/journals/pdf/5/2010/121_665.pdf"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.psa.ac.uk/journals/pdf/5/2010/121_665.pdf</span></a></span>, SEH)</p><p>Why has Complexity Theory Struggled … to complexity theory than this?</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>russia stuff<br/>Leadership High – SMRs</p><p>Russian nuclear exports strong now<br/>Reuters 12 (Reuters, “Russia doubles nuclear exports despite Fukushima,” 3/23/12) <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../af.reuters.com/article/energyOilNews/idAFL6E8EN4WP20120323-sp=true" tppabs="http://af.reuters.com/article/energyOilNews/idAFL6E8EN4WP20120323?sp=true"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://af.reuters.com/article/energyOilNews/idAFL6E8EN4WP20120323?sp=true</span></a></span></p><p>MOSCOW, March 23 (Reuters) - Russia doubled … Carbonnel; Editing by Ben Harding)&nbsp;</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>Russia is looking to compete in small reactors<br/>Kramer 10 (Andrew E.

I am a high-tech entrepreneur and philanthropist based in Silicon Valley. I have received numerous awards for my philanthropy. For example, in 2003, I was honored to receive a National Caring Award presented by then Senator Clinton. The largest engineering auditorium at MIT is named in my honor. The first community college LEED platinum building in the nation is also named in my honor.<br/>I am also active in Democratic politics. In the 2000 election, for example, I was the single largest political donor in the United States, donating over $10 million dollars to help Al Gore get elected. Unfortunately, we lost that one by one vote (on the Supreme Court).<br/>I have no vested interest in nuclear power or anything else that is described below. I write only as someone who cares about our nation, the environment, and our planet. I am trying to do everything I can so my kids have a habitable world to live in. Nothing more.<br/>Dr. James Hansen first made me aware of fast reactors in his letter to Obama in 2009<br/>As an environmentalist, I have been a fan of Jim Hansen’s work for nearly two decades. Many consider Dr. Hansen to be the world’s leading expert on global warming. For example, Hansen was the first person to make Congress aware of global warming in his Senate testimony in 1988. Hansen is also Al Gore’s science advisor.<br/>In 2009, Dr. Hansen wrote a letter to … ? It made no sense to me.<br/>Lack of knowledge, misinformation, and the complexity of nuclear technology have hampered efforts to get a fast reactor built in the US<br/>I spent the next two years finding out the answer to that question. The short answer is three-fold: (1) most people know absolutely nothing about the amazing fourth generation nuclear power plant that we safely ran for 30 years in the US and (2) there is a lot of misleading information being spread by seemingly respectable people (some of whom are in the White House) who never worked on a fourth generation reactor that is totally false. It’s not that they are misleading people deliberately; it’s just that they were either listening to the wrong sources or they are jumping to erroneous conclusions. For example, the most popular misconception is that “reprocessing is a proliferation risk.” That statement fails to distinguish between available reprocessing techniques. It is absolutely true for the French method but it is absolutely not true for the technology described in this letter! The third reason is that the technology is complicated. Most people don’t know the difference between oxide fuel and metal fuel. Most people don’t know what a fast reactor is. Most people can’t tell you the difference between PUREX, UREX, and pyroprocessing. So people with an agenda can happily trot out arguments that support their beliefs and it all sounds perfectly credible. They simply leave out the critical details.<br/>We don’t need more RandD. We … anything with it. That’s a serious mistake.<br/>Today, our nation faces many serious challenges such as:<br/>How can we avert global warming?<br/>How can we dispose of our existing nuclear waste safely?<br/>How can we generate base-load carbon-free power at very low cost?<br/>How can we avoid creating any additional long-lived nuclear waste?<br/>How can we grow our economy and create jobs?<br/>How can we become the world leader in clean energy?<br/>How can we do all of the above while at the same time spending billions less than we are now?<br/>The good news is that … his letter to the President.</p><p>The IFR is a fourth-generation … for fuel in fast reactors.<br/>It generates no long-lived nuclear waste.<br/>It is safer than today’s … can confirm that as well.<br/>The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission, in January 1994, issued a pre-application safety evaluation report in which they found no objections or impediments to licensing the IFR. You can see the NRC report in the 8 minute video.<br/>The design is proven. It produced electric power without mishap for 30 years before the project was abruptly cancelled.</p><p>Dr Charles Till<br/>The IFR’s ability to solve the nuclear waste problem should not be underestimated. As respected nuclear experts have pointed out, a practical solution to the nuclear waste problem is required if we are to revive nuclear power in the United States. The Blue Ribbon Commission (BRC) on America’s Nuclear Future basically concluded this: “continue doing the same thing we are doing today and keep doing RandD.” That was predictable because it was a consensus report; everyone had to agree. So nothing happened. And because there was no consensus from the BRC , there is less money for nuclear because there is no solution to the waste problem. It’s a downward death spiral.<br/>Please pardon me for a second and allow me to rant about consensus reports. In my 30 year career as an entrepreneur, I’ve raised tens of millions of millions of dollars in investment capital from venture capitalists all over the world. I always ask them how they make investment decisions. They always tell me, “If we had to get all partners to agree on an investment, we’d never make any investments. If you can get two partners to champion your company, that is sufficient to drive an investment decision.” Therefore, if you want to get nothing done, ask for a consensus report. If you want to actually solve problems, you should listen to what the people most knowledgeable about the problem are saying.</p><p>Dr Yoon I. Chang<br/>Had President Obama asked the … decades of inaction. Totally predictable.<br/>If we put a national focus on developing and cost reducing the IFR, we’d have a killer product and lead the world in being a clean energy leader<br/>It would be great if we had a long-term strategy and vision for how we become energy independent and solve the global warming problem and help our economy at the same time. The IFR can play a key role in that vision. If we put a national focus on developing and commercializing the IFR technology we invented, we can create jobs, help our trade balance, mitigate global warming, become energy independent, show the world a safe way to get rid of nuclear waste, and become the leaders in clean power technology.<br/>Nuclear power is the elephant … and cancelled the project in 1994.<br/>Cancelling the IFR was a big mistake. It’s still the world’s best fast nuclear technology according to an independent study by the Gen IV International Forum.<br/>Many top scientists all over the world believe that President Clinton’s decision was a huge mistake. The Senate had voted to continue to fund it. The project had been supported by six US Presidents; Republicans and Democrats. In fact, the project’s biggest proponent was Republican President Richard Nixon who said in 1971, “Our best hope today for meeting the Nation’s growing demand for economical clean energy lies with the fast breeder reactor.”<br/>Republican Senator Kempthorne said of the IFR cancellation:<br/>Unfortunately, this program was canceled just 2 short years before the proof of concept. I assure my colleagues someday our Nation will regret and reverse this shortsighted decision. But complete or not, the concept and the work done to prove it remain genius and a great contribution to the world.<br/>While I am not a big fan of Senator Kempthorne, I couldn’t agree more with what he said in this particular case.<br/>The IFR remains the single … #1 best overall advanced nuclear design.<br/>The IFR was cancelled in 1994 without so much as a phone call to anyone who worked on the project. They didn’t call then. They haven’t called since. They simply pulled the plug and told people not to talk about the technology.<br/>The US government invested over $5 … merits simply did not matter.<br/>I urge you to recommend to President Obama that he meet personally with Dr. Charles Till so that the President can hear first hand why it is so critical for the health of our nation and our planet that this project, known as the Integral Fast Reactor (IFR), be restarted. Dr. Till headed the project at Argonne National Laboratory until his retirement in 1997. He is, without a doubt, the world’s leading expert on IFR technology.<br/>Want to solve global warming? Easy. Just create a 24×7 clean power source that costs the same as coal. Prominent scientists believe that the IFR can achieve this.<br/>Dr. Hansen has pointed out … 2009 published in the Huffington Post:<br/>If you want to get emissions reductions, you must make the alternatives for electric power generation cheaper than coal. It’s that simple. If you don’t do that, you lose.<br/>The billions we invest in RandD … generation technologies. Not a single one.<br/>I found it really amazing that global leaders were promising billions, even hundreds of billions in Copenhagen for “fighting climate change” when they weren’t investing one cent in the nuclear technologies that can stop coal and replace it with something cheaper.<br/>&nbsp;Note: 6 days ago, on September 22, 2011, DOE agreed to give $7.5M to MIT to do RandD on a molten-salt reactor. That’s good, but we should be building the technology we already have proven in 30 years of operational experience before we invest in unproven new technologies.&nbsp;</p><p>Dr. Loewen has personally looked … want to save our planet.<br/>It isn’t just nuclear experts that support the IFR<br/>US Congressman John Garamendi (D-CA) is … build it outside of the US.<br/>Nobel prize winner Hans Bethe (now deceased) was an enthusiastic supporter. Freeman Dyson called Bethe the “supreme problem solver of the 20th century. Chuck Till told me the following story of Bethe’s support for the IFR:<br/>A tale from the past: A year or two before the events I’ll describe, Hans Bethe had been contacted by the Argonne Lab Director for his recommendation on who to seek to replace the existing head of Argonne’s reactor program.<br/>Bethe told him the best choice was already there in the Lab, so it was in this way that I was put in charge. I had had quite a few sessions with him in the years leading up to it, as we were able to do a lot of calculations on the effects of reactor types on resources that he didn’t have the capability at his disposal to do himself.<br/>So when I wanted to initiate the IFR thrust, the first outside person I went to was Bethe at Cornell. After a full day of briefing from all the specialists I had taken with me, he suggested a brief private meeting with me. He was direct. He said “All the pieces fit. I am prepared to write a letter stating this. Who do you want me to address it to? I think the President’s Science Advisor, don’t you?” I said the obvious – that his opinion would be given great weight, and would give instant respectability.<br/>He went on, “I know him quite well. Who else?” I said I was sure that Senator McClure (who was chairman of Senate Energy and Resources at the time) would be relieved to hear from him. That the Senator would be inclined to support us, as we were fairly prominent in the economy of the state of Idaho, and for that reason I had easy access to him. But to know that Hans Bethe, a man renowned for his common sense in nuclear and all energy matters, supported such an effort would give him the Senator solid and quotable reason for his own support, not dismissible as parochial politics, that the Senator would want if he was to lead the congressional efforts. “Yes,” he said in that way he had, “I agree.”<br/>I’ve always thought that the President’s Science Advisor’s intervention with DOE, to give us a start, was not the result of our meeting him, but rather it was because of the gravitas Hans Bethe provided with a one page letter.<br/>How do we lead the world in clean energy if we put our most powerful clean energy technology on the shelf?!?<br/>President Obama has stated that he wants the US to be a leader in clean energy. I do not see how we achieve that if we allow our most advanced clean energy technology to sit on the shelf collecting dust and we tell one of America’s most respected businessmen that he should build his clean energy technology in another country. We have an opportunity here to export energy technology to China instead of importing it. But due to Clinton’s decision, we are allowing the Russians to sell similar fast reactor technology to the Chinese. It should have been us.<br/>Re-starting the IFR will … generation technology in the world.<br/>If you delegate this to someone else, nothing will happen. Here’s why.<br/>Delegating this letter downward from the White House to someone in DOE to evaluate will result in inaction and no follow up. I know this from past attempts that have been made. It just gets lost and there is no follow up. Every time. The guys at DOE want to do it, but they know that they will get completely stopped by OMB and OSTP. Both Carol Browner and Steven Chu asked former DOE nuclear management what to do about nuclear waste. They were told that using fast reactors and reprocessing was the way to go. But nothing happened. So Chu has given up trying. According to knowledgeable sources, the White House has told DOE in no uncertain terms, “do not build anything nuclear in the US.” It’s not clear who is making these decisions, but many people believe it is being driven by Steven Fetter in OSTP.<br/>Dr. Till knows all of this. He knows that unless he personally meets with the President to tell the story of this amazing technology, nothing will happen.<br/>I’ve discussed the IFR with Steve Fetter and he has his facts wrong. Fetter is basically a Frank von Hippel disciple: they have written at least 14 papers together! It was von Hippel who was largely responsible for killing the IFR under Clinton.<br/>So von Hippel’s misguided thought process is driving White House policy today. That’s a big mistake. Professor von Hippel twists the facts to support his point of view and fails to bring up compelling counter arguments that he knows are true but would not support his position. He’s not being intellectually honest. I’ve experienced this myself, firsthand. For example, von Hippel often writes that fast reactors are unreliable. When I pointed out to him that there are several examples of reliable fast reactors, including the EBR-II which ran for decades without incident, he said, that these were the “exceptions that prove the rule.” I was floored by that. That’s crazy. It only proves that it is complicated to build a fast reactor, but that it can easily be done very reliably if you know what you are doing. There is nothing inherent to the technology that makes it “unreliable.” You just have to figure out the secrets. When von Hippel heard that Congressman Garamendi was supporting the IFR, he demanded a meeting with Garamendi to “set him straight.” But what happened was just the opposite: Garamendi pointed out to von Hippel that von Hippel’s “facts” were wrong. Von Hippel left that meeting with Garamendi with his tail between his legs muttering something about that being the first time he’s ever spoken with anyone in Congress who knew anything about fast nuclear reactors. In short, if you watch a debate between von Hippel and Garamendi (who is not a scientist), Garamendi easily wins on the facts. If you put von Hippel up against someone who knows the technology like Till, Till would crush von Hippel on both the facts and the arguments. But the Clinton White House never invited Till to debate the arguments with von Hippel. They simply trusted what von Hippel told them. Big mistake.<br/>There are lots of problems with von Hippel’s arguments. For example, von Hippel ignores reality believing that if the USA doesn’t do something then it will not happen. That’s incredibly naieve and he’s been proven wrong. The USA invented a safe way to reprocess nuclear waste that isn’t a proliferation risk called pyroprocessing. The nuclear material is not suitable for making a bomb at any time in the process. But we never commercialized it because von Hippel convinced Clinton to cancel it. The French commercialized their reprocessing process (PUREX) which separates out pure plutonium and makes it trivial to make bomb material. So because countries need to reprocess, they pick the unsafe technology because they have no alternative. Similarly, because von Hippel had our fast reactor program cancelled, the Russians are the leaders in fast reactor technology. They’ve been using fast reactor technology for over 30 years to generate power commercially. But we know the Russians have a terrible nuclear safety record (e.g., Chernobyl). The fact is that the Chinese are buying fast reactors from the Russians because there is no US alternative. The problem with von Hippel’s arguments are that the genie is out of the bottle. We can either lead the world in showing how we can do this safely, or the world will choose the less safe alternatives. Today, von Hippel’s decisions have made the world less safe. I could go on and on about how bad von Hippel’s advice is, but this letter is already way too long.</p><p>MIT was wrong in their report about “The Future of the Nuclear Fuel Cycle”<br/>The only other seemingly credible argument against building fast reactors now comes from MIT. The report’s recommendation that we have plenty of time to do RandD appears largely to be driven by one person, co-chair Ernie Moniz.<br/>Four world-famous experts on nuclear power and/or climate change and one Congressman challenged Moniz to a debate on the MIT campus on his report. Moniz declined.<br/>The report has several major problems. Here are a few of them.<br/>The MIT report is inconsistent. On the one hand it says, “To enable an expansion of nuclear power, it must overcome critical challenges in cost, waste disposal, and proliferation concerns while maintaining its currently excellent safety and reliability record.” We agree with that! But then it inexplicably says, “… there are many more viable fuel cycle options and that the optimum choice among them faces great uncertainty…. Greater clarity should emerge over the next few decades… A key message from our work is that we can and should preserve our options for fuel cycle choices by …continuing doing what we are doing today … and researching technology alternatives appropriate to a range of nuclear energy futures.” So even though we have a solution now that can be deployed so we can enable an expansion of nuclear power as soon as possible, MIT advises that we should spend a few more decades because we might find something better than the IFR. This is just about the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard coming from MIT. If you ask any scientist who knows anything about global warming, they will tell you we are decades late in deploying carbon-free power. Had we aggressively ramped fast nuclear closed-cycle reactors decades ago and promoted them worldwide, we wouldn’t be anywhere close to the disastrous situation we are in today. So we are decades too late in ramping up nuclear power, and Moniz wants us to spend decades doing more RandD to get a solution that might be lower cost than the IFR. That’s insane.<br/>The report looks at the market price of uranium, but the market price completely ignores the environmental impacts of uranium mining. Shouldn’t that be taken into account? It’s like the cost of gas is cheap because the market price doesn’t include the hidden costs: the impact on the environment and on our health.<br/>Do you really think that people are going to embrace expansion of uranium mining in the US? The MIT report is silent on that. So then we are back to being dependent on other countries for uranium. Wasn’t the whole point to be energy independent? The IFR provides that now. We wouldn’t have to do any uranium mining ever again. After a thousand years, when we’ve used all our existing nuclear waste as fuel, we can extract the additional fuel we need from seawater, making our seas less radioactive. We can do that for millions of years.</p><p>The MIT report ignores what other countries are doing. Obama wants the US to be a leader in clean energy technology. You do that <br/>by building the most advanced nuclear designs and refining them. That’s the way you learn and improve. MIT would have us stuck on old LWR technology for a few decades. Does anyone seriously think that is the way to be the world leader? There is virtually no room for improvement in LWR technology. IFR technology is nearly 100 times more efficient, and it emits no long term nuclear waste. If you are a buyer of nuclear power in China, which nuclear reactor are you going to pick? The one that is 100 times more efficient and generates no waste? Or the one that is 100 times less efficient and generates waste that you better store for a million years? Wow. Now that’s a real tough question, isn’t it. Gotta ponder that one. I’m sure Apple Computer isn’t taking advice from Moniz. If they were, they’d still be building the Apple I. Ernie should get a clue. The reason Apple is a market leader is because they bring the latest technology to market before anyone else, not because they keep producing old stuff and spend decades doing RandD to see if they can come up with something better. Other countries are not hampered by MIT’s report. France and Japan recently entered into an agreement with the US DOE whereby we’re giving them the IFR technology for them to exploit. Even though we are stupid, they aren’t stupid. The Chinese are ordering inferior oxide fueled fast reactors from Russia. If the US were building metal-fueled fast reactors with pyroprocessing, it’s a good bet the Chinese would be buying from us instead of the Russians. But if we take Moniz’s advice to not build the world’s best advanced nuclear technology we already have, then there is no chance of that happening. By the time we get to market with a fast reactor, it will be all over. We’ll arrive to the market decades late. Another great American invention that we blew it on.<br/>There will always be new … today with fourth generation nuclear.<br/>I know this is an unusual request, but I also know that if the President is allowed to evaluate the facts first hand, I am absolutely convinced that he will come to the same conclusion as we all have.<br/>I urge you to view an 8 minute video narrated by former CBS Morning News anchor Bill Kurtis that explains all of this in a way that anyone can understand. This video can be found at:<br/>The video will amaze you.<br/>If you would like an independent assessment of what I wrote above from a neutral , trustworthy, and knowledgeable expert, Bill Magwood would be an excellent choice. Magwood was head of nuclear at DOE under Clinton and Bush, and was the longest serving head of nuclear at DOE in US history. He served under both Clinton and Bush administrations. Magwood is familiar with the IFR, but the IFR was cancelled before he was appointed to head civilian nuclear at DOE. So Magwood has no vested interest in the IFR at all. More recently, Magwood was appointed by President Obama to serve on the NRC and is currently serving in that role. Of the current five NRC Commissioners, Magwood is by far, the person most knowledgeable (PMK) about fast reactors.<br/>Thank you for your help in bringing this important matter to the President’s attention.<br/>Summary<br/>Nuclear power is needed. Renewables alone won’t do it.<br/>In order to revive nuclear in the US, you must have a viable solution to the nuclear waste problem.<br/>The French reprocess their nuclear waste, but their process is expensive, environmentally unfriendly, and has proliferation problems.<br/>The USA developed an inexpensive, … leader in clean energy technology.</p><p>President Obama should meet personally with Dr. Charles Till, the world’s leading expert on fast reactor technology. Dr. Till will not waste his time meeting with anyone other than the President because he knows that without personal support of the President, nothing will happen. He’s right.<br/>Supporters of this technology include Nobel prize winner Hans Bethe (now deceased), Steven Chu, Dr. James Hansen, Dr. Charles Till, Dr. Eric Loewen, Congressman John Garamendi, Bill Gates, and even the President of MIT. Even the board of directors of the historically anti-nuclear Sierra Club has agreed that they will not oppose building an IFR!<br/>Opposition is from OSTP and OMB. We don’t know who or why. It’s a mystery to all my sources. Frank von Hippel thinks you cannot make fast reactors cheaply or reliably and maintains that stance even when the facts show that not to be the case. Ernie Moniz at MIT thinks we shouldn’t build anything now, but do more RandD for the next several decades hoping we can find something better.<br/>Bill Magwood, an Obama appointee to the NRC, would be a reasonable choice to provide an objective assessment of the IFR. He has no vested interested in the IFR, but having been the longest serving head of DOE civilian nuclear in history, is familiar with the pros and cons of the technology.<br/>Should OSTP and OMB be making these key decisions behind closed doors? Is this really reflective of what the President wants? He’s stated publicly he wants the US to be a world leader in clean energy. Is putting our best technology on the shelf, but licensing the French and Japanese to build it (Joint Statement on Trilateral Cooperation in the area of Sodium-cooled Fast Reactors signed on October 4, 2010 by DOE), the best way for the US to achieve the leadership that Obama said he wanted?<br/>I am happy to provide you with additional information.</p><p>IFRs have been demonstrated to work – tech exists<br/>Brook et al 9 (Barry Brook, Professor of Climate Change University of Adelaide, Tom Blees, George Stanford, nuclear reactor physicist, retired from Argonne National Laboratory, and GLR Cowan, “Response to an Integral Fast Reactor (IFR) critique,” 2/21/9) <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../bravenewclimate.com/2009/02/21/response-to-an-integral-fast-reactor-ifr-critique/index.htm" tppabs="http://bravenewclimate.com/2009/02/21/response-to-an-integral-fast-reactor-ifr-critique/"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://bravenewclimate.com/2009/02/21/response-to-an-integral-fast-reactor-ifr-critique/</span></a></span><br/>BWB IFRs are sodium-… of the integrated IFR plant.<br/>GS “Integral” refers to the fact that the fuel processing facility can be an integral part of the IFR plant.<br/>…one or another largely undeveloped form of reprocessing/partitioning to separate transuranics (including plutonium) and actinides (long-lived waste)<br/>BWB Transuranics are actinides — they are not separate things as the above implies.

Thus a thermal reactor cannot be a net burner of transuranic actinides. The main starting fuel for thermal reactors is a mixture of the fissile isotope U-235 (Pu- 239 can also be used), along with the fertile isotope U-238.<br/>What in the world are “transuranic actinides?”<br/>They are the elements beyond uranium—that is, their atomic number is 93 or greater: neptunium, plutonium, americium, curium and more.

They are also called higher actinides.<br/>And what do you mean by “fissile” and “fertile?”<br/>An isotope is called “fertile” when the addition of a neutron changes it into a fissile isotope—one that, like U-235, has a very high probability of undergoing fission when exposed to thermal neutrons.

There are books and papers galore that appear to be credible citing all the reasons nuclear is a bad idea. I could probably spend the rest of my life investigating them all. Those reports that have been brought to my attention I've looked into and, after a fair amount of effort, found them not to be persuasive. <br/>Did you know that there is more than 100 times more radiation from a typical coal plant than a nuclear plant, yet the nuclear plant is perceived by the public to be a radiation hazard. <br/>Another example of misinformation is in Discover magazine June 2009 entitled "New Tech Could Make Nuclear the Best Weapon Against Climate Change" talking about the importance of the IFR to both greenhouse gas emissions and to our future energy needs. But the article implies the scientists want to do more studies and that an improved design will take 10 to 20 years. I keep in close touch with a number of the top scientists who worked on the IFR, including IFR inventor Charles Till, and they are saying the opposite...that we are 20 years late on building one and the sooner we build one, the better. <br/>We should build a $3B demonstration plant now to get started<br/>We should be exploring all … much faster and more cheaply.</p><p>IFRs are technologically ready – there’s a commercial version waiting to be made, has to be approved<br/>Brook 11 (Barry Brook, Professor of Climate Change University of Adelaide, “Nuclear power and climate change – what now?” 5/28/11) <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../bravenewclimate.com/2011/05/28/np-cc-what-now/index.htm" tppabs="http://bravenewclimate.com/2011/05/28/np-cc-what-now/"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://bravenewclimate.com/2011/05/28/np-cc-what-now/</span></a></span><br/>But detractors will nevertheless complain … safely embrace them with enthusiasm.&nbsp;</p><p>Fast reactor technology has been proven to work multiple times – their example bad<br/>Brook et al 9 (Barry Brook, Professor of Climate Change University of Adelaide, Tom Blees, George Stanford, nuclear reactor physicist, retired from Argonne National Laboratory, and GLR Cowan, “Response to an Integral Fast Reactor (IFR) critique,” 2/21/9) <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../bravenewclimate.com/2009/02/21/response-to-an-integral-fast-reactor-ifr-critique/index.htm" tppabs="http://bravenewclimate.com/2009/02/21/response-to-an-integral-fast-reactor-ifr-critique/"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://bravenewclimate.com/2009/02/21/response-to-an-integral-fast-reactor-ifr-critique/</span></a></span><br/>2.

Relevant developments have included:<br/>- Multiculturalism and the pluralisation of social values and individual lifestyles, raising fundamental questions about whether categorical ecological imperatives(most recently the IPCC’s famous 4°C threshold) really do exist.<br/>- The functional differentiation of modern societies, implying that the democratic institutions of the state are less and less able to integrate and control societal subsystems. The new patterns of governance are increasingly undemocratic (opaque, unaccountable), with the state only one of several actors with its sovereignty noticeably castrated.<br/>- The rapid increase of societal subsystems – most notably the economy, science and the media – as well as individual lifeworlds and network, beyond the boundaries of the nation-state, hence increasingly eluding the control of national democratic politics.<br/>- The increasing abstraction and complexity of environmental issues (e.g. climate change, energy security, the environmental footprint of specific products). The most important risks cannot be directly perceived by citizens but are measured, framed and communicated by scientific experts. Invariably, this implies the disempowerment of the democratic sovereign.<br/>- The acceleration of change and the flexibilization of social norms, reinforcing a fixation on the present. In both private life and public policy, thinking beyond the crises of the day and taking decisions for an entirely unpredictable future becomes increasingly difficult.<br/>- Finally, the extension of the ecological footprint of modern consumer societies far beyond their national territory (and their respective present), invalidating the democratic principle of congruence between the authors of political decisions and those affected by them.
