But what about Germany and Japan? <br/>The sequester — $85 billion this year in across-the-board budget cuts, about half of which will come from the Pentagon — gives Americans an opportunity to discuss a question we’ve put off too long: Why we are still fighting World War II? <br/>Since 1947, when President Harry S. Truman set forth a policy to stop further Soviet expansion and “support free peoples” who were “resisting subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures,” America has acted as the world’s policeman. <br/>For more than a century, Britain had “held the line” against aggression <br/>AND<br/>its waterways. Stalin was strong-arming governments from Finland to Iran. <br/>Some historians say Truman scared the American people into a broad, open-ended commitment to world security. But Americans were already frightened: in 1947, 73 percent told Gallup that they considered World War III likely. <br/>From the Truman Doctrine emerged a strategy comprising multiple alliances: the Rio Pact of <br/>AND<br/>we invented the practice of foreign aid, beginning with the Marshall Plan. <br/>It was a profound turn even from 1940, when Franklin D. Roosevelt won <br/>AND<br/>into European conflicts the better for the United States and for the world.” <br/>World War II, and the relative impotence of the United Nations, convinced successive <br/>AND<br/>, Afghanistan) but the world, as a whole, experienced fewer. <br/>We were not so much an empire — the empire decried by the scholar and veteran Andrew J. Bacevich and celebrated by the conservative historian Niall Ferguson — as an umpire, one that stood for equal access by nation-states to political and economic gains; peaceful arbitration of international conflict; and transparency in trade and business. <br/>But conditions have changed radically since the cold war. When the United States established major bases in West Germany and Japan, they were considered dangerous renegades that needed to be watched. Their reconstructed governments also desired protection, particularly from the Soviet Union and China. NATO’s first secretary general, Hastings Ismay, famously said the alliance existed “to keep the Russians out, the Americans in, and the Germans down.” <br/>Today, our largest permanent bases are still in Germany and Japan, which are <br/>AND<br/>in the Pacific — speaks to the irrational endurance of the Truman Doctrine. <br/>Our wars in the Middle East since 2001 doubled down on that costly, outdated doctrine. The domino theory behind the Vietnam War revived under a new formulation: but for the American umpire, the bad guys (Al Qaeda, Iran, North Korea) will win. <br/>Despite his supporters’ expectations, President Obama has followed a Middle East policy nearly identical to his predecessor’s. He took us out of Iraq, only to deepen our commitment to Afghanistan, from which we are just now pulling out. He rejected the most odious counterterrorism techniques of George W. Bush’s administration, but otherwise did not change basic policies. Mr. Obama’s gestures toward multilateralism were not matched by a commensurate commitment from many of our allies. <br/>Cynics assert that the “military-industrial complex” Dwight D. Eisenhower presciently warned against has primarily existed to enrich and empower a grasping, imperialist nation. But America was prosperous long before it was a superpower; by 1890, decades before the two world wars, it was already the world’s largest and richest economy. We do not need a large military to be rich. Quite the opposite: it drains our resources. <br/>Realists contend that if we quit defending access to the world’s natural resources — read<br/>AND<br/>leaders. The Libyan crisis showed that our allies can do a lot. <br/>The United States can and should pressure Iran and North Korea over their nuclear programs. It must help to reform and strengthen multilateral institutions like the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. It must champion the right of small nations, including Israel, to “freedom from fear.” But there are many ways of achieving these goals, and they don’t all involve more borrowing and spending. <br/>Partisan debates that focus on shaving a percentage point off the Pentagon budget here or there won’t take us where we need to go. Both parties are stuck in a paradigm of costly international activism while emerging powers like China, India, Brazil and Turkey are accumulating wealth and raising productivity and living standards, as we did in the 19th century. The long-term consequences are obvious. <br/>America since 1945 has paid a price in blood, treasure and reputation. Umpires may be necessary, but they are rarely popular and by definition can’t win. Perhaps the other players will step up only if we threaten to leave the field. Sharing the burden of security with our allies is more than a fiscal necessity. It’s the sine qua non of a return to global normalcy.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>Hegemony is a paranoid fantasy---the strategy omnipotence sees threats to empire everywhere, which necessitates constant violence---you have an obligation to place the structural violence that hegemony invisibilizes at the core of your decision calculus <br/>McClintock 9—chaired prof of English and Women’s and Gender Studies at UW–Madison.

Gene - Deputy Assistant to President for Economic Policy. "PROSPECTIVE OVERRULING AND THE REVIVAL OF "UNCONSTITUTIONAL" STATUTES," Columbia Law Review, Dec 93, lexis<br/>Unlike the Supreme Court, several state courts have explicitly addressed the revival issue. The relevant state court cases have concerned the specific issue of whether a statute that has been held unconstitutional is revived when the invalidating decision is overturned. n42 With one exception, they have concluded that such statutes are immediately enforceable.<br/>The most noted instance in which the revival issue was resolved by a court involved the District of Columbia minimum wage statute pronounced unconstitutional in Adkins. After the Court reversed Adkins in West Coast Hotel, President Roosevelt asked Attorney General Homer &nbsp;~*1913~ &nbsp;Cummings for an opinion on the status of the District of Columbia’s statute. The Attorney General responded,<br/>&nbsp;The decisions are practically in accord in holding that the courts have no power to repeal or abolish a statute, and that notwithstanding a decision holding it unconstitutional a statute continues to remain on the statute books; and that if a statute be declared unconstitutional and the decision so declaring it be subsequently overruled the statute will then be held valid from the date it became effective. n43<br/>Enforcement of the statute followed without congressional action. n44<br/>When this enforcement was challenged, the Municipal Court of Appeals for the District of <br/>AND<br/>decision is reversed the statute is valid from its first effective date. n46<br/>&nbsp;The court declared this precedent sound since the cases were "in accord with <br/>AND<br/>a period judicially unenforceable, there was no need to reenact it. n49<br/>Almost all other courts that have addressed the issue of whether a statute that has <br/>AND<br/>rejecting this claim and in finding for the husband, the Court stated:<br/>&nbsp;Since we have declared the uniform court rule partially unconstitutional, it appears to <br/>AND<br/>an assumption of legislative power not delegated to it by the Constitution. n52<br/>&nbsp;The Louisiana Court thus took a mechanical approach to the revival question. According to its rationale, when a statute is found unconstitutional, it is judicially determined never to have existed. Revival therefore entails judicial legislation and thereby violates constitutionally mandated separation of powers: because the initial legislative passage &nbsp;~*1915~ &nbsp;of the bill has no legitimacy, the bill’s force is considered to be purely a creature of judicial decision-making.<br/>Jefferson has little analytic appeal. Its view of the separation of powers doctrine is <br/>AND<br/>a statute did not revive does not offer a convincing rationale for nonrevival.</p></div></div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>03/30/2013</td><td style="width:100%; word-wrap:break-word;"><div><!--  <input type="image" onclick="deleteEntry('10', 'http://opencaselist.paperlessdebate.com/xwiki/rest/wikis/opencaselist/spaces/Northwestern/pages/Miles-Shakoor Neg/objects/Admin.EntryClass/')" value="Delete" title="Delete" style="float:right;" src="/xwiki/resources/icons/silk/cross.gif" />

These hysterics often have some basis in reality, but are blown up to illogical and ridiculous proportions. Part of the reason they’re so appealing is that they have the ring of plausibility along with the intrigue of a horror flick. <br/>In many cases, the alarmists identify a legitimate issue, take the possible consequences to an extreme, and advocate action on the basis of these extreme projections. In 1972, the editor of the journal Nature pointed out the problem with the typical alarmist approach: "~Alarmists’~ most common error is to suppose that the worst will always happen."82 But of course, if the worst always happened, the human race would have died out long ago. <br/>When alarmism has a basis in reality, the challenge becomes to take appropriate action based on that reality, not on the hysteria. The aftermath of Silent Spring offers examples of both sorts of policy reactions: a reasoned response to a legitimate problem and a knee-jerk response to the hysteria. <br/>On the positive side, Silent Spring brought an end to the general belief that <br/>AND<br/>of their effect on soil, water, wildlife, and man himself." <br/>Indeed, Carson seemed to advocate reasoned response to rigorous scientific investigation, and in <br/>AND<br/>information is gathered through routine testing of chemicals for use in the environment. <br/>Ironically, rigorous investigation was not used in the decision to ban DDT, primarily <br/>AND<br/>in the environment, without pronouncing a death sentence on millions of people. <br/>A major challenge in developing appropriate responses to legitimate problems is that alarmism catches people’s attention and draws them in. Alarmism is given more weight than it deserves, as policy makers attempt to appease their constituency and the media. It polarizes the debaters into groups of "believers" and "skeptics," so that reasoned, fact-based compromise is difficult to achieve. Neither of these aspects of alarmism is healthy for the development of appropriate policy. <br/>Further, alarmist responses to valid problems risk foreclosing potentially useful responses based on ingenuity <br/>AND<br/>and favoring one particular replacement technology at the expense of other promising technologies. <br/>Environmental alarmism should be taken for what it is—a natural tendency of some portion of the public to latch onto the worst, and most unlikely, potential outcome. Alarmism should not be used as the basis for policy. Where a real problem exists, solutions should be based on reality, not hysteria.&nbsp;</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HNofoodshortages" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>No food shortages</span></h4><p><strong>Goklany 9</strong>—Worked with federal and state governments, think tanks, and the private sector for over 35 years. &nbsp;Worked with IPCC before its inception as an author, delegate and reviewer.

True<br/>AND<br/>Its influence, however, has to be wielded in a new mode. <br/>With today’s power distribution, no one actor, and no one set of actors<br/>AND<br/>financial regulation, and with Russia and Europe on the management of Iran. <br/>No other state has anything like this range of tactical alliances available to them. <br/>AND<br/>Nuclear Security Summit-but it was the United States that did so. <br/>This is a complex game, where the United States can no longer get its <br/>AND<br/>others will look first to the largest minority shareholder to lead the way. <br/>But this comparative advantage cannot be overplayed. If the United States attempts to portray <br/>AND<br/>less dominant position, the United States needs a new mindset about strategy. <br/>PART 2: IMPLICATIONS FOR U.S. STRATEGY AND INTERNATIONAL ORDER<br/>That all of this matters can be illustrated by imagining the negative scenarios if the <br/>AND<br/>grind to a halt, global trade and finance will begin to erode. <br/>Of course, the primary purpose of international order-to prevent major power war-is even more fundamental. But well short of active conflict between the major powers, mismanagement of the changing international system can pose tremendous costs for the United States and virtually everyone else. <br/>Avoiding a G-Zero scenario, a major power conflict, and continued high <br/>AND<br/>complemented by frank debate, but not firm divides, on human rights. <br/>Fostering cooperation on global finance and transnational threats<br/>In the realm of global finance, the United States has adapted to the new <br/>AND<br/>the rising powers at the IMF, at the expense of European seats. <br/>Extending cooperation to other issues is easy to wish for, harder to do. <br/>AND<br/>major power approaches to Iran and North Korea, with some important success. <br/>A similar combination of formal and informal approaches could help to solidify cooperation on terrorism <br/>AND<br/>be extended to burden-sharing on trade security in more sensitive locations. <br/>It is debatable whether such cooperation could be extended to active crises, for example <br/>AND<br/>build trust in significant, second order problems such as Somalia or Yemen. <br/>A further area where cooperation can grow is development. Sustaining global economic recovery will <br/>AND<br/>of western development strategies, an open mind and genuine dialogue seem warranted. <br/>Cooperative efforts serve two purposes. They are important for functional reasons; the issues <br/>AND<br/>carries more punch. Counterterrorism cooperation should have greater visibility in both countries. <br/>Shared interests in tackling transnational threats will only be a part of an overall sense of security. Other security issues-regional security and energy security-will drive divergence. But deeper collaboration on shared threats can contextualize the inevitable confrontations ahead. <br/>Regulating economic and energy competition<br/>In other areas, the nature of U.S., European and emerging power <br/>AND<br/>but states profit or lose differently from different regulations; hence fierce competition. <br/>Similar competitive dynamics over the rules have blocked deeper trade cooperation in recent years. <br/>AND<br/>as indeed is acknowledged in the QDDR’s proposals for "elevating economic diplomacy." <br/>Issues of relative loss and relative gain may be particularly hard to manage on questions <br/>AND<br/>climate and the short-term conflict risks of unregulated competition over energy. <br/>This does not mean abandoning any sense that some of these areas can serve as <br/>AND<br/>policy, do seem set to cause rough competition, veering into conflict. <br/>Investing in tools for crisis de-escalation and management<br/>Because competition is inevitable, and because regional security dilemmas will almost certainly prove more complicated over time, a third and critical component of strategy will be to invest up front in tools for crisis de-escalation and management. <br/>Much of this will be region specific. But across the board, a key <br/>AND<br/>of power, its presence will help defuse clashes with the emerging powers. <br/>We can also be creative about the role of middle powers. Against a backdrop <br/>AND<br/>more concrete crisis prevention and management tools? These issues warrant quiet exploration. <br/>The United States can and should also invest in reinforcing the UN Security Council (<br/>AND<br/>deployments. These halted crises before they could escalate into direct superpower confrontations. <br/>Growing use of the UNSC has been a point of surprising commonality between the Bush<br/>AND<br/>region where the shift in the balance of power will be most volatile. <br/>Still, even if there were a positive vote in the General Assembly (GA<br/>AND<br/>for allowing swift alignment between G-20 leaders during the financial crisis.) <br/>Crisis management capacity could be developed in several ways: creating an informal mechanism that <br/>AND<br/>G-20, nor locks the United States into untested membership change. <br/>And there are interesting models of both informal and semi-formal major power cooperation <br/>AND<br/>is the example of counter-piracy cooperation in the Horn of Africa. <br/>Frank debate, not firm divides, on human rights<br/>Finally, it is important to touch on what may be the most contentious of issues between the United States and the emerging powers, namely human rights. <br/>On basic human rights issues, the key dynamic will be between the West and <br/>AND<br/>with human rights was a mild opening, but certainly one worth pursuing.<br/>More broadly, using human rights standards or issues of democracy promotion as a yardstick <br/>AND<br/>and Germany banded together to block U.S. action in Iraq.<br/>So, contentious, yes; neatly dividing the west from the rest, no. There is complexity not cleavage here. And an effort to use human rights or democratic criteria to drive hard cleavages in the international system would likely provoke more serious banding together by the emerging powers-against, not in favor of, our strategy.<br/>CONCLUSION<br/>America has rebounded from dips in its influence before. An oil price rise before economic downturn, a brewing crisis in Iran, a rising competitor, domestic divides and a Democratic president facing a resurgent right-welcome to 1978. Still, absent dramatic change, an economic shift to "the rest" will continue, and political influence will follow.<br/>If we foster cooperation where interests allow, and devote serious resources to global economic and energy diplomacy, we can balance the contentious dynamics of regional security and human rights. Preparing for crises by investing in management tools can help de-escalate them when they arrive. <br/>This may fail, as the domestic resonance of competition drives out awareness of shared <br/>AND<br/>G-Zero scenario, with risks of direct conflict between the powers.&nbsp;</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HAgrandstrategyofprimacyrequirestheunipoletofreezetheglobaldistributionofpower2014-causes2Ccounter-balancing2Candwar" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>A grand strategy of primacy requires the unipole to freeze the global distribution of power—-causes, counter-balancing, and war</span></h4><p>Nuno P. <strong>Monteiro 12</strong>, Assistant Professor of Political Science at Yale University, "Unrest Assured: Why Unipolarity is Not Peaceful," International Security, Winter 2012, Vol. 36, No. 3, p. 9-40<br/>A unipole carrying out a defensive-dominance strategy will seek to preserve all three <br/>AND<br/>out these two pathways to conflict and then illustrate them with historical examples.<br/>To be sure, states can never be certain of other states’ intentions.61 <br/>AND<br/>, the systemic imbalance of power magnifies uncertainty about the unipole’s intentions.63<br/>Faced with this uncertainty, other states have two options. First, they can <br/>AND<br/>as Wohlforth points out, the power differential rests in its favor.66 <br/>Accommodation, however, entails greater risks for minor powers because their survival is not assured if the unipole should turn against them. Thus some of them are likely to implement a second strategic option—resisting the unipole.<br/>The structure of the international system does not entirely determine whether or not a minor <br/>AND<br/>states, the costs of balancing were lower relative to those of bandwagoning.<br/>In an international system with more than one great power, recalcitrant minor powers would<br/>AND<br/>themselves, which puts them in a position of extreme self-help.<br/>There are four characteristics common to states in this position: (1) anarchy<br/>AND<br/>Recalcitrant minor powers will therefore attempt to bolster their capabilities through internal balancing.<br/>To deter an eventual attack by the unipole and bolster their chances of survival in the event deterrence fails, recalcitrant minor powers will attempt to reinforce their conventional defenses, develop the most effective asymmetric strategies possible, and, most likely in the nuclear age, try to acquire the ultimate deterrent—survivable nuclear weapons.73 In so doing, they seek to become major powers.<br/>Defensive dominance, however, also gives the unipole reason to oppose any such revisions <br/>AND<br/>that could become the harbinger of an unwanted large-scale balancing attempt.<br/>The unipole is therefore likely to demand that recalcitrant minor powers not revise the status quo. The latter, however, will want to resist such demands because of the threat they pose to those states’ security.74 Whereas fighting over such demands would probably lead to defeat, conceding to them peacefully would bring the undesired outcome with certainty.

Indeed, in "The Stability of a Unipolar World," he underscored its durability.11 U.S. preponderance is so marked, he wrote, that "~f~or many decades, no state is likely to be in a position to take on the United States in any of the underlying elements of power."12<br/>Wohlforth further argued that a durable unipolar world is also a peaceful world.

These do not aim at systematically testing my argument, for two reasons. First, the unipolar era is too short a period to test structural mechanisms. Second, the United States has consistently implemented a strategy of dominance, limiting opportunities to test my claims on the consequences of disengagement.26</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HHegemonicretrenchment2019skeytopreventwarwithRussiaandChina2014-defusesGeorgia2CTaiwanandtheSouthChinaSeas" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Hegemonic retrenchment’s key to prevent war with Russia and China—-defuses Georgia, Taiwan and the South China Seas</span></h4><p>Paul K. <strong>MacDonald 11</strong>, Assistant Professor of Political Science at Williams College, and Joseph M.

Accordingly, in most cases, these exceptions are unlikely to benefit foreign investors in U.S. renewable energy projects.<br/>Under Exon-Florio, the President is authorized to suspend or prohibit any covered transaction if there is credible evidence that the foreign person exercising control might take action that threatens to impair U.S. national security.<br/>The term "national security" is not defined in the statute or implementing regulations and is construed broadly by CFIUS to include all facts and circumstances that have potential national security implications. Factors that will heighten CFIUS’s interest in a transaction include whether the acquisition target: <br/>has contracts with the U.S. government, particularly sole- or single-source defense contracts, classified contracts or contracts with U.S. government agencies that have national security responsibilities (e.g., homeland security, intelligence); <br/>possesses sensitive or classified technologies, particularly with defense or law enforcement applications, or produces goods, services, or technologies subject to export controls; <br/>controls "critical infrastructure," including major energy assets; or <br/>is engaged in operations that involve nuclear energy. <br/>In addition, the prospective purchaser’s nationality and whether it is controlled or owned (in whole or in part) by a foreign government are important factors in determining whether a CFIUS review may be appropriate.<br/>In light of these factors, national security concerns may arise in a number of ways when a foreign entity acquires a U.S. renewable energy business: <br/>If the U.S. business holds sensitive, classified, or export controlled information or technology, or provides power or energy-related products directly to a U.S. government agency, CFIUS approval should be sought. <br/>Transactions involving foreign control over "major energy assets" are subject to heightened scrutiny<br/>AND<br/>could materially disrupt an energy supply chain likely would raise national security concerns.<br/>The nationality of the acquirer likely influences the CFIUS process. Transactions involving acquirers based in China, Russia, certain countries in the Middle East, and other countries perceived as "non-cooperative" with respect to national security-related matters likely will be subject to greater scrutiny than transactions involving acquirers based in the E.U. or other G20 nations.&nbsp;</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HOCSmeets2014-thatmeansoilandnaturalgasaffs" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>OCS meets —- that means oil and natural gas affs</span></h4><p><strong>NRC 11&nbsp;</strong>Natural Resources Committee, "Obama Administration Imposes Five-Year Drilling Ban on Majority of Offshore Areas" November 8, 2011, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../naturalresources.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx-DocumentID=267985" tppabs="http://naturalresources.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=267985"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://naturalresources.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=267985</span></a></span><br/>WASHINGTON, D.C., November 8, 2011 - After imposing a nearly <br/>AND<br/>and Pacific Coasts off-limits to new energy production and job creation.</p><h4 id="HCoalAffsmeet" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Coal Affs meet</span></h4><p><strong>DOI No Date&nbsp;</strong>U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIORBUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../www.blm.gov/wo/st/en/prog/energy/coal_and_non-energy.print.html" tppabs="http://www.blm.gov/wo/st/en/prog/energy/coal_and_non-energy.print.html"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.blm.gov/wo/st/en/prog/energy/coal_and_non-energy.print.html</span></a></span><br/>Public lands are available for coal leasing only after the lands have been evaluated through <br/>AND<br/>may appear on leases as either stipulations to uses or restrictions on operations.&nbsp;</p><h4 id="HWindAffsmeet" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Wind Affs meet</span></h4><p><strong>BBNEP No Date&nbsp;</strong>"Buzzards Bay National Estuary Program" <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../buzzardsbay.org/windfarms.htm" tppabs="http://buzzardsbay.org/windfarms.htm"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://buzzardsbay.org/windfarms.htm</span></a></span><br/>The first state approval for the project came in May 2005 when approval was given <br/>AND<br/>Cape Wind can be viewed at the MEPA website, Certificate 12643 FEIR.</p><h4 id="HIt2019sarbitraryandunderminesresearch" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>It’s arbitrary and undermines research</span></h4><p>Resnick 1 Evan- assistant professor of political science – Yeshiva University, &nbsp;"Defining Engagement," Journal of International Affairs, Vol. 54, Iss. 2<br/>In matters of national security, establishing a clear definition of terms is a precondition <br/>AND<br/>"engagement," they undermine the ability to build an effective foreign policy.</p></div></div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>03/31/2013</td><td style="width:100%; word-wrap:break-word;"><div><!--  <input type="image" onclick="deleteEntry('18', 'http://opencaselist.paperlessdebate.com/xwiki/rest/wikis/opencaselist/spaces/Northwestern/pages/Miles-Shakoor Neg/objects/Admin.EntryClass/')" value="Delete" title="Delete" style="float:right;" src="/xwiki/resources/icons/silk/cross.gif" />
