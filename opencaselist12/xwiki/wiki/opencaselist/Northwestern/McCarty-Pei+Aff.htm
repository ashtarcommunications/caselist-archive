However, the mullahs are also cynics and men determined, more than anything, to maintain their hold on absolute power.<br/>Which is why it’s unlikely that they would immediately use their new weapons against Israel. An outright attack on Israel - - a country possessing as many as 200 nuclear weapons and sophisticated delivery systems — would lead to the obliteration of Tehran, the deaths of millions, and the destruction of Iran’s military and industrial capabilities.<br/>The mullahs know this. But here’s the problem: It may not matter. The threat of a deliberate nuclear attack pales in comparison with the chance that a nuclear-armed Iran could accidentally trigger a cataclysmic exchange with Israel.<br/>Warp-Speed Escalation<br/>The experts who study this depressing issue seem to agree that a Middle East in which Iran has four or five nuclear weapons would be dangerously unstable and prone to warp-speed escalation.<br/>Here’s one possible scenario for the not-so-distant future: Hezbollah, <br/>AND<br/>question of what it will do if Israel refuses to heed its demand.<br/>Dennis Ross, who until recently served as President Barack Obama’s Iran point man on <br/>AND<br/>chain of events that would be like ’Guns of August’ on steroids."<br/>Imagine that Israel detects a mobilization of Iran’s rocket force or the sudden movement of <br/>AND<br/>compelled to attack Israel first, knowing that it has no second chance?<br/>Bruce Blair, the co-founder of the nuclear disarmament group Global Zero and an expert on nuclear strategy, told me that in a sudden crisis Iran and Israel might each abandon traditional peacetime safeguards, making an accidental exchange more likely.<br/>"A confrontation that brings the two nuclear-armed states to a boiling point would likely lead them to raise the launch- readiness of their forces — mating warheads to delivery vehicles and preparing to fire on short notice," he said. "Missiles put on hair-trigger alert also obviously increase the danger of their launch and release on false warning of attack — false indications that the other side has initiated an attack."<br/>Then comes the problem of misinterpreted data, Blair said. "Intelligence failures in the midst of a nuclear crisis could readily lead to a false impression that the other side has decided to attack, and induce the other side to launch a preemptive strike."<br/>’Cognitive Bias’<br/>Blair notes that in a crisis it isn’t irrational to expect an attack, and this expectation makes it more likely that a leader will read the worst into incomplete intelligence. "This predisposition is a cognitive bias that increases the danger that one side will jump the gun on the basis of incorrect information," he said.<br/>Ross told me that Iran’s relative proximity to Israel and the total absence of ties <br/>AND<br/>nearly had a nuclear war. We were much closer than we realized."<br/>The answer to this predicament is to deny Iran nuclear weapons, but not through an attack on its nuclear facilities, at least not now. "The liabilities of preemptive attack on Iran’s nuclear program vastly outweigh the benefits," Blair said. "But certainly Iran’s program must be stopped before it reaches fruition with a nuclear weapons delivery capability."<br/>Ross argues that the Obama administration’s approach — the imposition of steadily more debilitating sanctions — may yet work. There’s a chance, albeit slim, that he may be right: New sanctions are just beginning to bite and, combined with an intensified cyberwar and sabotage efforts, they might prove costly enough to deter Tehran.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HProliferationislikelytobefastanddestabilizing2013makingnuclearwarlikely" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Proliferation is likely to be fast and destabilizing – making nuclear war likely</span></h4><p><strong>Evans and Kawaguchi 9</strong> (Gareth, Chancellor of the Australian National University, an Honorary Professorial Fellow at the University of Melbourne and President Emeritus of the Brussels-based International Crisis Group, and Yoriko Kawaguchi, Member of the House of Councillors for the Liberal Democratic Party since 2005.

This use of punishment does not end at the CIS’ borders even though it is most frequently employed there.

is the most likely potential crisis that could trigger a nuclear war between China and the US, a new academic report concludes.<br/>"Taiwan remains the single most plausible and dangerous source of tension and conflict between the US and China," says the 42-page report by the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).<br/>Prepared by the CSIS’ Project on Nuclear Issues and resulting from a year-long study, the report emphasizes that Beijing continues to be set on a policy to prevent Taiwan’s independence, while at the same time the US maintains the capability to come to Taiwan’s defense.<br/>"Although tensions across the Taiwan Strait have subsided since both Taipei and Beijing embraced a policy of engagement in 2008, the situation remains combustible, complicated by rapidly diverging cross-strait military capabilities and persistent political disagreements," the report says.<br/>In a footnote, it quotes senior fellow at the US Council on Foreign Relations Richard Betts describing Taiwan as "the main potential flashpoint for the US in East Asia."<br/>The report also quotes Betts as saying that neither Beijing nor Washington can fully control developments that might ignite a Taiwan crisis.<br/>"This is a classic recipe for surprise, miscalculation and uncontrolled escalation," Betts wrote in a separate study of his own.<br/>The CSIS study says: "For the foreseeable future Taiwan is the contingency in which nuclear weapons would most likely become a major factor, because the fate of the island is intertwined both with the legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party and the reliability of US defense commitments in the Asia-Pacific region."<br/>Titled Nuclear Weapons and US-China Relations, the study says disputes in the East and South China seas appear unlikely to lead to major conflict between China and the US, but they do "provide kindling" for potential conflict between the two nations because the disputes implicate a number of important regional interests, including the interests of treaty allies of the US.<br/>The danger posed by flashpoints such as Taiwan, the Korean Peninsula and maritime demarcation disputes is magnified by the potential for mistakes, the study says.<br/>"Although Beijing and Washington have agreed to a range of crisis management mechanisms, such as the Military Maritime Consultative Agreement and the establishment of a direct hotline between the Pentagon and the Ministry of Defense, the bases for miscommunication and misunderstanding remain and draw on deep historical reservoirs of suspicion," the report says.<br/>For example, it says, it is unclear whether either side understands what kinds of actions would result in a military or even nuclear response by the other party.<br/>To make things worse, "neither side seems to believe the other’s declared policies and intentions, suggesting that escalation management, already a very uncertain endeavor, could be especially difficult in any conflict," it says.<br/>Although conflict "mercifully" seems unlikely at this point, the report concludes that "it cannot be ruled out and may become increasingly likely if we are unwise or unlucky."<br/>The report says: "With both sides possessing and looking set to retain formidable nuclear weapons arsenals, such a conflict would be tremendously dangerous and quite possibly devastating."<br/>Russia aggression goes nuclear<br/><strong>Blank 9</strong> – Dr. Stephen Blank is a Research Professor of National Security Affairs at the Strategic Studies Institute of

Scientific dissenters are likely to speak up loudly, and those with political or economic interest in dismissing the danger of climate change will benefit from this turn of the debate. They need not take on the arduous task of arguing that adverse effects of human activity are too unlikely to be worth worrying about. All they have to do is disprove that adversity is a foregone conclusion. A memo from a Republican politician in the United States illustrates the last point. Articulated as a defence of President Bush's resistance to greenhouse gas reductions, it says: 'Should the public come to believe that the scientific issues are settled, their views about global warming will change accordingly. Therefore, you need to continue to make the lack of scientific certainty a primary issue in the debate' (quoted from Lanchester 2007, p. 5)<br/>It is in many ways unfortunate that scientists who try to pass the greenhouse theory for certified truth open the door to this kind of argumentation. They play into the hands of those who are out to disparage the theory by allowing them to trade on its margin of error. But lack of certainty is, as we have seen, no embarrassment to the theory and no reason not to act on its dire predictions.<br/>Generally speaking, the line between pseudo-danger and real danger is crossed long <br/>AND<br/>reality playing for time' (quoted from Lanchester 2007, p. 3).<br/>Enviro Prag Good – Warming<br/>Pragmatic warming policy is effective and key to prevent extinction---the K results in disengagement and endless theoretical uncertainty that debilitates action---only the perm can bridge the gap<br/>Simpson 10 (Francis, College of Engineering, Vanderbilt University, “Environmental Pragmatism and its Application to Climate Change The Moral Obligations of Developed and Developing Nations to Avert Climate Change as viewed through Technological Pragmatism”, Spring 2010 | Volume 6 | Number 1)<br/>Pragmatism and Footprinting<br/>Environmental pragmatism is a relatively new field of environmental ethics that seeks to move beyond <br/>AND<br/>have a moral obligation to protect the future of humanity and the biosphere.</p></div></div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>03/31/2013</td><td style="width:100%; word-wrap:break-word;"><div><!--  <input type="image" onclick="deleteEntry('50', 'http://opencaselist.paperlessdebate.com/xwiki/rest/wikis/opencaselist/spaces/Northwestern/pages/McCarty-Pei Aff/objects/Admin.EntryClass/')" value="Delete" title="Delete" style="float:right;" src="/xwiki/resources/icons/silk/cross.gif" />
