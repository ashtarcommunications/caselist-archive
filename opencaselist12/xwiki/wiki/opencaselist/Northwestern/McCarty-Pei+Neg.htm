"Power Down the Subsidies to Energy Producers" Aug 3 &nbsp;www.heritage.org/research/commentary/2011/08/power-down-the-subsidies-to-energy-producers<br/>America has an energy addiction - and it~’s not an addiction to oil, as many politicians would have you think. It~’s an addiction to government subsidies. The addicts, you see, are energy producers, not the consumers.<br/>Their growing dependence on federal handouts is the real cause of America~’s energy crisis. Energy subsidies have needlessly wasted taxpayer dollars, retarded commercialization of new technologies and failed to reduce our reliance on foreign energy sources. Washington would do well to end all energy subsidies.<br/>Energy subsidies come in numerous forms ranging from direct expenditures to targeted tax breaks, from production mandates to loan guarantees. Basically, any public policy that favorsthe production or consumption of one type of energy over another can be considered a subsidy.<br/>None of them come cheap. According to the Energy Information Agency, the federal government gave the energy industry %248.2 billion in subsidies and financial aid in 1999. This figure more than doubled to %2417.9 billion in 2007 and more than doubled again to %2437.2 billion last year.<br/>But the damage subsidies inflict on our economy extends well beyond direct costs. A special endorsement from the government artificially props up that technology. This reduces the incentive for the producer to become cost-competitive, stifles innovation and encourages government dependence.<br/>The federal government has no business picking commercial winners and losers. That~’s the job of the marketplace. Indeed, it~’s doubly damaging when government decides to manipulate the market through subsidies, because government - almost invariably - picks losers. That~’s not surprising, because companies that seek handouts most strenuously are those that cannot compete without them.</p><h4 id="HSolvesgreatpowerwar-1" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Solves great power war</span></h4><p><strong>Baru 9</strong> Sanjaya is a Professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School in Singapore Geopolitical Implications of the Current Global Financial Crisis, Strategic Analysis, Volume 33, Issue 2 March 2009 , pages 163 – 168<br/>Hence, economic policies and performance do have strategic consequences.2 In the modern <br/>AND<br/>to find adequate financial resources to simultaneously sustain economic growth and military power.&nbsp;</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HNuclearisoverwhelminglyuncompetitiveevenwithloanguarantees" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Nuclear is overwhelmingly uncompetitive even with loan guarantees</span></h4><p>Lovins 10 AMORY B.

EPA has emphasized the importance of regular inspections and monitoring activity to detect noncompliance, and has responded to violations with swift and appropriate sanctions. EPA’s policies also mandate that the agency recover the economic benefit firms realize through noncompliance, since if a firm is able to profit from illegal activity, it has little incentive to comply in the first place. <br/>State environmental agencies actually carry out the majority of enforcement activity in this country because <br/>AND<br/>enforcement is relatively lax, and agencies rarely respond to violations with penalties. <br/>Citizen enforcement also is a feature of most federal environmental statutes. The statutes allow citizens to sue companies for violations when the government fails to do so and various, often strict, procedural conditions are met. Traditionally, Congress has viewed citizen enforcement as an important supplement to agency enforcement and an important prod to agency regulators. <br/>What People are Fighting About<br/>In recent years there has been a sharp debate over the future direction of environmental enforcement. Many states and regulated entities advocate a more business-friendly, conciliatory enforcement strategy, one that does not emphasize enforcement actions and penalties as the keys to securing compliance. In their view, businesses are likely to comply without resort to sanctions because of adherence to social and political norms, market forces, and other factors. <br/>Thus, many states have reduced funding for inspections. enforcement cases and similar activities<br/>AND<br/>also keep materials contained in environmental audits secret and exempt from public disclosure. <br/>At the same time, EPA has to some degree deemphasized traditional enforcement and used <br/>AND<br/>toll and EPA’s commitment to deterrence-based enforcement appears to be weakening. <br/>In reaction to these changes, environmental groups, contend that government enforcement is too <br/>AND<br/>imposed obstacles have significantly undermined the role envisioned by Congress for citizen enforcers.</p><h4 id="HTheSEPpenaltycausesindustrynoncompliance2014-triggersthesameindustryresponseastheaff2Cwhilepreservingtherestriction" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>The SEP penalty causes industry noncompliance —- triggers the same industry response as the aff, while preserving the restriction</span></h4><p>David <strong>Dana</strong>, Professor of Law, Boston University School of Law, 19<strong>98</strong>, ARTICLE: THE UNCERTAIN MERITS OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENFORCEMENT REFORM: THE CASE OF SUPPLEMENTAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECTS, 1998 Wis.

Envtl. L.J. 91<br/>Nonetheless, there are steps that can be taken to tighten up the approval process and make it friendlier to renewable energy development. The two amendments to the IMDA proposed here &nbsp;~[*133~] &nbsp;would provide that the Secretary’s failure to act within the time allotted constitutes approval, and that in determining whether a minerals agreement is in the tribe’s best interest, the Secretary will defer to the tribe’s decision.<br/>Under the IMDA, the Secretary has 180 days to approve or disapprove a minerals <br/>AND<br/>the court’s decision is no better than waiting two years for the Secretary’s.<br/>A better approach would borrow from the proposed statutory amendments to the TERA process. <br/>AND<br/>able to implement their agreements within a reasonable time, outweigh those concerns.<br/>The second way to streamline the approval process for renewable energy resources is to address <br/>AND<br/>or cultural effects" other than the environmental studies required by NEPA. n195<br/>The regulations, on the other hand, require that the Secretary determine both that <br/>AND<br/>for similar resources, "insofar as that information is readily available." n199<br/>These standards, derived from judicial determinations that the Secretary must consider all relevant factors <br/>AND<br/>on the basis of the Secretary’s judgement, a best interest determination." n201<br/>At the time the IMDA was enacted in 1982, federal Indian policy had only <br/>AND<br/>by the imbalance of knowledge and bargaining power between tribes and energy companies.<br/>But nearly twenty years have passed since the regulations were &nbsp;~[*136~] &nbsp;promulgated in 1994. Indian tribes have thirty years of experience with IMDA minerals agreements, and many of the energy tribes have become sophisticated negotiators of development deals. Certainly tribes are the best determiners of cultural and social impacts, and often of the economic impacts as well.

This trust relationship means the federal government must ensure that tribes get a fair shake when their land is leased for mining, grazing, logging or drilling. In recent years, Indians have sued the Interior Department, accusing the agency of mismanaging billions of dollars it collected from those leases (HCN, 5/12/03: Missing Indian money: Piles or pennies?). <br/>But some tribal leaders and environmental groups say there aren’t enough financial and human resources in Indian Country to ensure that tribal energy resources are developed in an environmentally responsible way. They fear that the legislation, dubbed the "Native American Energy Development and Self-Determination Act" before being rolled into a larger, catchall Senate energy bill, would leave tribes vulnerable to exploitation by energy companies. <br/>Historically, when tribes have tried to assert their authority over corporations, "they’re challenged at every turn," says David Getches, a professor of natural resource law at the University of Colorado and one of the founders of the Native American Rights Fund. "When you’re talking about things like power plants, where there are millions of dollars involved, you will see some of the most vigorous challenges ever to tribal sovereignty." <br/>"I think a better name for this legislation would be the ’Native American Self-Termination Act’," says Robert Shimek, special projects director for the Indigenous Environmental Network and a member of the Chippewa Tribe. "The way it’s proposed, it reopens the door for dirty projects — projects that nobody else wants." <br/>Shimek is wary of a return to the days when the federal government endorsed projects like the Black Mesa coal mine on the Navajo reservation in northeastern Arizona. In the 1960s, the Peabody Coal Company strip-mined 17,000 acres of tribal lands, and the still-active operation has been blamed for depleting the aquifer and drying up the Hopi Tribe’s sacred springs. <br/>"(Tribal lands) were essentially energy colonies for the rest of the country," says Lester. <br/>When the Senate resumes debate on the energy bill this summer, Campbell is expected to offer an amendment addressing some of critics’ concerns, including retaining Interior’s trust responsibility and laying out requirements that tribes would have to follow when conducting environmental reviews.&nbsp;</p><h4 id="HAnd2Cthenet-benefit:" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>And, the net-benefit:</span></h4><h4 id="HCPreinvigoratesNEPA2014-createsperceptionofstrongenvironmentallawintheUS2014-EIS2019sarekey-1" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>CP reinvigorates NEPA—-creates perception of strong environmental law in the US—-EIS’s are key</span></h4><p><strong>Weiland 97</strong> (Paul S.

First, consuming renewable energy would eliminate the problem with best value because, unlike RECs, renewable energy responds to and fulﬁlls agencies’ actual energy needs. 140 For Joe, the energy manager, the ability to use renewable energy means that he would not need to spend part of his energy budget on a commodity that does not address his actual energy needs. 141<br/>Second, consuming renewable energy would eliminate the problems with transparency and accountability. 142 Because the policies plainly require agencies to consume renewable energy, complying by consuming renewable energy, rather than purchasing RECs, would be transparent. 143 Moreover, because this method of compliance is transparent and allows a clear view of what the Government is doing in response to the requirements of the policies, it allows the Government to be held accountable. 144<br/>Third, consuming renewable energy produced at on-site facilities would further the policies’ goal of developing on-site renewable energy facilities. 145 Having facilities on or near agency property would provide power to the installation in case the grid is attacked or fails. 146 It would also promote the energy independence, security, and sustainability of both the Federal Government and the nation as a whole by developing new renewable energy facilities. 147<br/>Developing new renewable energy facilities on or near agency installations would allow agencies to consume <br/>AND<br/>the lack of available land or other factors makes facility development impossible. 150</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HAvoidspolitics2014-RECstriggermassivebacklash2014-perceivedasabackdoorcarbontax" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Avoids politics—-RECs trigger massive backlash—-perceived as a backdoor carbon tax</span></h4><p>Bill <strong>Sweet 12</strong>, Editor of IEEE Spectrum, a publication of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, 3/2/12, "Are Renewable Energy Credits Excessively Expensive?," <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../spectrum.ieee.org/energywise/energy/renewables/are-renewable-energy-credits-excessively-expensive" tppabs="http://spectrum.ieee.org/energywise/energy/renewables/are-renewable-energy-credits-excessively-expensive"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://spectrum.ieee.org/energywise/energy/renewables/are-renewable-energy-credits-excessively-expensive</span></a></span><br/>The Manhattan Institute, a public policy research outfit with a free-market and <br/>AND<br/>producers of green energy that are paid for by producers of dirty energy.<br/>The REC, and even perhaps some of the purposes the REC is meant to <br/>AND<br/>as a first stab at assessing the overall costs to consumers of RECs.<br/>Basically Bryce compares the costs of electricity in states that have renewable energy mandates with <br/>AND<br/>rates in states with portfolio standards, and nor does he claim to.<br/>Bryce notes that tightening regulation of coal generating plants and higher expenditures on power transmission also have been major factors in driving up electricity costs.

a Democratic President is reportedly mulling him for defense secretary and the same Republican <br/>AND<br/>Hamas in hopes of reanimating the corpse of the Middle East pace process. <br/>Furthermore, Hagel’s flagrant disdain for the runaway MIC (military industrial complex), preemptive <br/>AND<br/>, rather than putting their rear-ends in harm’s way over there. <br/>The War Against Hagel has hardly been decisive, however, at least as we <br/>AND<br/>that Hagel’s independence would be a help not a hindrance where it counts: <br/>What we need are American officials who will speak with disconcerting bluntness to Israel about <br/>AND<br/>is not bound to old models, could be useful in this regard. <br/>Many of us see Hagel’s impact in much broader terms than just the Israel question<br/>AND<br/>by Americans conditioned to accept there is a military solution for every problem. <br/>"In a town dominated by often-unexamined conventional wisdom, the appointment of <br/>AND<br/>a liberal hawk, he thinks there should be limits on American power." <br/>Although President Obama has, so far, not said a word about Hagel, the former senator who quietly spent the last four years chairing the moderate Atlantic Council, is enjoying an enthusiastic defense from myriad commentators across the mainstream, including Andrew Sullivan, Steve Clemons, Peter Beinart — even Jim Judis at The New Republic. Several ambassadors — including Bush-era Nick Burns and Ryan Crocker and three Israel representatives — signed on to a letter encouraging his nomination. <br/>Meanwhile, The National Journal and The Washington Post have published biographical sketches emphasizing Hagel’s <br/>AND<br/>astutely swatting away the haters at every turn of this increasingly torrid offensive.<br/>Michele Flournoy<br/>But while many of us here at Antiwar would like a Hagel nomination for Christmas<br/>AND<br/>who see a kindred soul where Hagel is just heartburn ready to happen. <br/>So buttressed is Flournoy by the Washington elite that people like Paul Wolfowitz, who <br/>AND<br/>casualty count was much lower then —- 117 in 2007 to be exact. <br/>When liberal flak Eleanor Clift wrote about the prospects of the "first female defense <br/>AND<br/>today’s accounts of continuing bloat, waste and mission creep are any indication. <br/>Frankly, one hears a lot about Flournoy the "team player" but very <br/>AND<br/>pushing it in a more realist direction than we have in the past." <br/>Perhaps that is why so many of us here are excited about the prospect. <br/>AND<br/>or personality of one man, even if he is at the apex." <br/>Still, if a Flournoy pick would signal an endorsement of the status quo, <br/>AND<br/>who ended up running, and losing, in the last two elections).</span></h4><h4 id="HRestraint2019skeytopreventwarwithRussiaandChina2014-defusesGeorgia2CTaiwanandtheSouthChinaSeas" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Restraint’s key to prevent war with Russia and China—-defuses Georgia, Taiwan and the South China Seas</span></h4><p>Paul K. <strong>MacDonald 11</strong>, Assistant Professor of Political Science at Williams College, and Joseph M.

(Human 58)<br/>What Arendt so beautifully describes is that isolation and individualism are not corollaries, and <br/>AND<br/>even similarly but not exactly together is what Arendt calls the "social."<br/>Arendt does not mean that group behavior is impossible in the realm of the social<br/>AND<br/>.

She saw that a situation like Nazi Germany is different from the conventional understanding of a tyranny. Pitkin writes,<br/>Totalitarianism cannot be understood, like earlier forms of domination, as the ruthless exploitation of some people by others, whether the motive be selfish calculation, irrational passion, or devotion to some cause. Understanding totalitarianism’s essential nature requires solving the central mystery of the holocaust—the objectively useless and indeed dysfunctional, fanatical pursuit of a purely ideological policy, a pointless process to which the people enacting it have fallen captive. (87)<br/>Totalitarianism is closely connected to bureaucracy; it is oppression by rules, rather than by people who have willfully chosen to establish certain rules. It is the triumph of the social.<br/>Critics (both friendly and hostile) have paid considerable attention to Arendt’s category of <br/>AND<br/>and turning us into robots that mechanically serve its purposes" (4).<br/>Pitkin is critical of this version of the "social" and suggests that Arendt <br/>AND<br/>put it another way, theories of powerlessness are self-fulfilling prophecies.<br/>Arendt grants that there are people who willed the Holocaust, but she insists that <br/>AND<br/>"critical thought is in principle anti-authoritarian" (Lectures 38).<br/>By "thought" Arendt does not mean eremitic contemplation; in fact, she <br/>AND<br/>that harmony. One must consider carefully the arguments and viewpoints of others:<br/>Political thought is representative. I form an opinion by considering a given issue from <br/>AND<br/>more valid my final conclusions, my opinion. ("Truth" 241)<br/>There are two points to emphasize in this wonderful passage. First, one does <br/>AND<br/>a world into which one enters and by which one might be changed.<br/>Second, passages like the above make some readers think that Arendt puts too much <br/>AND<br/>destroy truth, but they cannot replace it" ("Truth" 259).<br/>Facts have a strangely resilient quality partially because a lie "tears, as it <br/>AND<br/>of opinion is a farce unless factual information is guaranteed" (238).<br/>The sort of thinking that Arendt propounds takes the form of action only when it <br/>AND<br/>thoughts without reference to anyone else or to let others do one’s thinking.<br/>Arendt’s Polemical Agonism<br/>As I said, agonism does have its advocates within rhetoric—Burke, Ong<br/>AND<br/>"understood and believed" by others (Shape 5; emphasis added).<br/>Arendt’s version is what one might call polemical agonism: it puts less emphasis on <br/>AND<br/>polemical agonism, success may be marked through the quality of subsequent controversy.<br/>Arendt quotes from a letter Kant wrote on this point:<br/>You know that I do not approach reasonable objections with the intention merely of refuting them, but that in thinking them over I always weave them into my judgments, and afford them the opportunity of overturning all my most cherished beliefs. I entertain the hope that by thus viewing my judgments impartially from the standpoint of others some third view that will improve upon my previous insight may be obtainable. ~&#123;Lectures 42)<br/>Kant’s use of "impartial" here is interesting: he is not describing a <br/>AND<br/>butprovocative application of Arendt’s notion of common, see Hauser 100-03).<br/>In polemical agonism, there is a sense in which one’ s main goal is <br/>AND<br/>¬larged" ~&#123;Lectures 39); he wanted interlocutors, not acolytes.<br/>This is not consensus-based argument, nor is it what is sometimes called <br/>AND<br/>, the conflictual versus the collaborative, or argument as opposed to debate.<br/>Second, while polemical agonismrequires diversity among interlocutors, and thus seems an extraordinarily appropriate <br/>AND<br/>of argument versus when we are lusting for dominion ("Truth" 263).<br/>Like other proponents of agonism, Arendt argues that rhetoric does not lead individuals or <br/>AND<br/>in lack of imagination and failure to judge" ("Truth" 242).<br/>Agonism demands that one simultaneously trust and doubt one’ s own perceptions, rely on <br/>AND<br/>these few have not become fewer in our time" ~&#123;Human 324).<br/>Yet, there are important positive political consequences of agonism.<br/>Arendt’ s own promotion of the agonistic sphere helps to explain how the system could <br/>AND<br/>is, engage in rhetoric—then they are engaging in antitotalitarian action.<br/>In post-Ramistic rhetoric, it is a convention to have a thesis, <br/>AND<br/>not relativist, adversarial but not violent, independent but not expressivist rhetoric.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HEffectivedecision-makingoutweighs2014--1" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Effective decision-making outweighs—-</span></h4><h4 id="HKeytosocialimprovementsineveryandallfacetsoflife-1" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Key to social improvements in every and all facets of life</span></h4><p>Steinberg %26 Freeley 8 *Austin J.

Broadly speaking ... the president has two ways of making up his mind. The one is to turn to his subordinates—to his chiefs of staff and his cabinet officers and undersecretaries and the like—and to direct them to argue out the issues and to bring him an agreed decision…<br/>The other way is to sit like a judge at a hearing where the issues to be decided are debated. After he has heard the debate, after he has examined the evidence, after he has heard the debaters cross-examine one another, after he has questioned them himself he makes his decision…<br/>It is a much harder method in that it subjects the president to the stress of feeling the full impact of conflicting views, and then to the strain of making his decision, fully aware of how momentous it Is. But there is no other satisfactory way by which momentous and complex issues can be decided.16<br/>John F.

In this department, racism is, essentially, everything. <br/>One course teaches that "Housing discrimination systematically skews opportunities and life chances," another that "racism, sexism, and heterosexism shape black life chances in a 21st century context," while yet another zeroes in on "the effects of institutional racism on social policy, desegregation, integration, and affirmative action programs." <br/>Then there is "Blacks in the Media" - or, rather, one <br/>AND<br/>Washington in the old days, or Queen Latifah and Halle Berry today. <br/>Following from this glum desperation is a fetishization of radical politics as blacks’ only constructive <br/>AND<br/>same department also offers a course on, more specifically, black Marxism. <br/>According to this curriculum, being black has been so horrific that we are even challenged by the mere physicality of existence. One courses teaches that black women’s bodies have to be "important spaces of resistance," while another is based on the idea that black people have been done in by various permutations of "urban spatial relations." <br/>Because racism and inequality will always exist in some forms, this all qualifies as <br/>AND<br/>, gender and sexuality affect their cognitive, social, and emotional development." <br/>One senses that the people teaching in African-American Studies departments feel that blackness is indeed something very different, likely because African slaves were unwilling immigrants. However, Ralph Ellison once asked "Can a people live and develop for over three hundred years simply by reacting?" <br/>To those who would consider themselves representing black people by answering in the affirmative, there are legions of black people of all walks who would heartily disagree. There is no self-standing metric of unassailable truth that justifies intellectuals treating that disagreement - that is, the life-spirit of a people millions strong making the best of the worst for four hundred years — as unworthy of serious address. <br/>As to the possible objection that course descriptions do not engage these departments closely enough, a look at a few actual course syllabi is useful. <br/>At the University of Pennsylvania, the syllabus for "Racial and Sexual Conflict" <br/>AND<br/>material covered in this course gives precious little support to such an endeavor. <br/>One week, the discussion concerns the questions as to "What role does educational <br/>AND<br/>ambitious students about urgent realities, how are sources such as these irrelevant? <br/>At the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, one course exemplifies the focus on radicalism. "Race, Radicalism and African American Culture" seeks to "track the genealogy of the movement that came to be called ’Black Power,’ and to situate black radical artists and intellectuals in the broader history of twentieth-century American thought, culture, and politics." <br/>And the course covers a noble procession of figures: Marcus Garvey, W.<br/>AND<br/>, the legacy of Malcolm X or the legacy of Dr. King? <br/>As to King, the course does address Bayard Rustin, who was central to <br/>AND<br/>common political orientation among modern academics in the humanities, including black ones? <br/>To the extent that the answer is the latter, students are being underserved. <br/>AND<br/>had a dream indeed — but he didn’t mean us to stop there. <br/>The issue is not the quality of these courses in themselves. I will gladly <br/>AND<br/>as sense incarnate. This is not what education is supposed to be. <br/>To the extent that these courses and syllabi are typical, then, there is a problem. And anyone familiar with African-American Studies departments knows that these courses and syllabi are, indeed, typical. <br/>African-American Studies departments have a place in a liberal arts education. However, to deserve that inclusion in anything beyond a symbolic sense, they should revise their curricula in exactly two ways, simple but crucial. <br/>First, there should be full acknowledgment in all courses that the role of racism in black people’s lives and fates is receding, and to such a degree that the race’s challenges today are vastly different than they were forty years ago. <br/>The aim should not be to downplay the reality of racism, but to present precisely what education consists of: the ambiguities and challenges of real life and how one thinks about it. <br/>Defeatism should be discouraged. Any sense that defeatism is the empirically proper position on black American history in the same way as it would have been for Pompeiians in the face of the eruption of Mount Vesuvius fails — for the simple reason that progress for black Americans continues on so many fronts.<br/>Most of the people in question would resist being characterized as defeatist, or as not acknowledging change. However, there is acknowledgment and there is genuflection. Plus, a claim that black radicalism is our only real future is, in itself, defeatism. Four centuries of black history give no indication that these politics will significantly affect how most black people thrive.<br/>For example, a course like Yale’s on "African-American Politics" should <br/>AND<br/>Bradley Effect, as opposed to its recruitment as a strategy of indoctrination. <br/>The course I mentioned on blacks’ problems with urban space flags environmental racism - but would ideally mention the important work of Christopher Foreman of the Brookings Institution (black, for the record) showing that claims along these lines have been overblown. <br/>It must also fall out of this that there will be no such thing as <br/>AND<br/>in to, rather than coping with, the ills of our history. <br/>In the same vein, black popular music (including hip hop) should not be treated as most interesting in how it happened to intersect with (leftist and radical) political ideology - anymore than klezmer music, Chinese opera, or Tchaikovsky is. What about how our music is just good?<br/>Second, an African-American Studies department should be considered larval without a course on black conservative thought - upon which courses on black radicalism would then be acceptable as alternative arguments.<br/>Crucially, token assignment of writings of ancient three-named figures like Booker T. Washington, who wrote amidst post-Civil War conditions now ancient history, are a mere beginning. Most departments already slip in Washington, for example - although they should now regularly engage Robert Norrell’s new biography that rescues the man from a century of calumny. <br/>However, equally central to honest engagement with "black thought" are modern figures <br/>AND<br/>Stephen and Abigail Thernstrom, Lawrence Mead, Dan Subotnik and Peter Wood. <br/>There is an argument hardly unfamiliar in the halls of ivy that black writers of <br/>AND<br/>of the others in this school are not written in this format either. <br/>Thomas Sowell is read by millions in a nationally syndicated column, and this is <br/>AND<br/>not being with the black radical program means not being "culturally black." <br/>To be sure, many professors in African-American Studies departments think of themselves <br/>AND<br/>millions of blacks have overcome having never heard of politics of this kind.<br/>These views, nevertheless, have value and should be heard. Yet they are not, on their own, truth. They verge into excess and anti-empiricism as readily as views from the right. There exist as many intelligent "contestings" of these leftist views as there exist "contestings" of the writings of Shelby Steele or myself. In a university department worth the status, contesting from all sides must be heard.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>AT FW=Exclusion—-2NC Must Read <br/>At least the 1<sup>st</sup> card&nbsp;</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HOurargumentforlimited2Ctopic-focuseddebateisnotviolentoroppressive2Candneitherisvotingforit2014-proceduralconstraintsondebatesolvetheworstaspectsofright-wingpolitics" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Our argument for limited, topic-focused debate is not violent or oppressive, and neither is voting for it—-procedural constraints on debate solve the worst aspects of right-wing politics</span></h4><p>Amanda <strong>Anderson 6</strong>, Andrew W.

But if you look deeper, you’ll find that some of the most inspiring art forms, such as haikus, sonatas, and religious paintings, are fraught with constraints. They are beautiful because creativity triumphed over the "rules." Constraints shape and focus problems and provide clear challenges to overcome. Creativity thrives best when constrained.<br/>But constraints must be balanced with a healthy disregard for the impossible. Too many curbs can lead to pessimism and despair. Disregarding the bounds of what we know or accept gives rise to ideas that are non-obvious, unconventional, or unexplored.

Venture capital and private-equity financing for renewables dropped to its lowest in at least six years in 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.<br/>Competition for the best investments from Blackstone Group LP to Warren Buffett along with a plunge in profit from the solar and wind industries prompted the shift. It pushed Silicon Valley into taking smaller stakes in emerging technologies that help squeeze efficiency and flexibility from power supplies.<br/>"We are going through a repositioning of cleantech," said Wal van Lierop, founder of Chrysalix Energy Venture Capital, which is based in Vancouver. "The big sectors — solar, wind and LEDs — are in the process of being consolidated. They’re maturing, so they fall out of the cleantech opportunity basket. We now are trying to find the next hot spots."<br/>Investment flowing from private equity and venture capital firms into renewable energy fell 34 percent to %245.75 billion last year, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, the lowest since at least 2006. That accounted for 2.2 percent of the %24268.7 billion invested in the clean energy industry, down from as much as 6.5 percent in 2008.<br/>Grid Technology<br/>Chrysalix invested in the energy-management providers Enbala Power Networks and AlertMe Ltd. Khosla funded LightSail Energy Inc., which is developing energy storage devices.<br/>"Our specialty is with large technology risk, where if the technology works there’s a big economic breakthrough," Vinod Khosla, the billionaire founder of Khosla Ventures in Menlo Park, California, said in an interview. "That’s what we keep looking for in all areas."<br/>Alan Salzman, chief executive officer of VantagePoint Capital Partners, said systems that allow energy to be used more efficiently and help the grid cope with variable supplies from wind and solar plants represent the richest new areas.<br/>Energy storage is "an essential component" for renewable energy to thrive, Salzman said. "That’s an area that has been hugely underserved historically that we think remains hugely interesting," he said.<br/>Energy Efficiency<br/>VantagePoint, based in San Bruno, California, backed Next Step Living Inc. and Tendril Networks Inc., which developed energy-efficiency software to reduce power consumption.<br/>"One of the disappointments in the U.S. is that our utility smart-grid deployments have really slowed," Salzman said. Deployments have "shifted overseas right now, away from the U.S., because of our regulatory environment," he said. "It doesn’t mean that our archaic system — see Hurricane Sandy — isn’t ripe for updating."<br/>So-called energy smart technologies including efficiency products and equipment for the electricity grid amounted to %242.2 billion of the clean energy investment from venture capital and private equity tracked last year by New Energy Finance. The category accounted for 38 percent of VC/PE funding for clean energy last year, up from 15 percent in 2008.<br/>Renewables Dwindling<br/>Profits have drained away from renewable energy in the past three years as manufacturing capacity surged quicker than demand. Solar cell prices plunged 74 percent since the end of 2010 to 40 cents from %241.46 for each watt of capacity. The cost of installing wind turbines on land fell 15 percent to %2481.44 per megawatt of capacity since mid-2009, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates.<br/>That reduced the industry’s attractiveness for venture capital companies. With solar, now that the technology is proven, the industry’s biggest challenge is driving down costs, said Raj Prabhu, managing partner at Mercom Capital Group in Austin, Texas.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HSolvescompetitiveness2Ceconomiccollapse2Candgiantblackouts" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Solves competitiveness, economic collapse, and giant blackouts</span></h4><p>Stephen <strong>Chu</strong>, Nobel Prize in Physics, <strong>12</strong> ~["America’s Competitiveness Depends on a 21st Century Grid," May 30, Energy.Gov, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../energy.gov/articles/america-s-competitiveness-depends-21st-century-grid~~" tppabs="http://energy.gov/articles/america-s-competitiveness-depends-21st-century-grid~~"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://energy.gov/articles/america-s-competitiveness-depends-21st-century-grid~~</span></a></span>] PMA=Power Marketing Administrations<br/>Upgrades are Key to American Competitiveness¶ The leadership of the PMAs is critically important <br/>AND<br/>flexible and resilient electric grid and establish much greater coordination among system operators.&nbsp;</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HGridcollapsecausesnuclearwar2014-disruptsmilitarycommunication" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Grid collapse causes nuclear war—-disrupts military communication</span></h4><p><strong>Andres and Breetz 11</strong><br/>Richard Andres, Professor of National Security Strategy at the National War College and a Senior Fellow and Energy and Environmental Security and Policy Chair in the Center for Strategic Research, Institute for National Strategic Studies, at the National Defense University, and Hanna Breetz, doctoral candidate in the Department of Political Science at The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Small Nuclear Reactorsfor Military Installations:Capabilities, Costs, andTechnological Implications, <span class="wikicreatelink"><a href="../../../bin/create/www.ndu.edu/press/lib/pdf/StrForum/SF-262/pdf-parent=Northwestern.McCarty-Pei+Neg" tppabs="http://opencaselist.paperlessdebate.com/xwiki/bin/create/%2F%2Fwww.ndu.edu%2Fpress%2Flib%2Fpdf%2FStrForum%2FSF%2D262/pdf?parent=Northwestern.McCarty%2DPei+Neg"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">pdf</span></a></span><br/>The DOD interest in small reactors derives largely from problems with base and logistics vulnerability<br/>AND<br/>in order to win an ongoing battle or war would be greatly reduced.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div></div></div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>03/30/2013</td><td style="width:100%; word-wrap:break-word;"><div><!--  <input type="image" onclick="deleteEntry('61', 'http://opencaselist.paperlessdebate.com/xwiki/rest/wikis/opencaselist/spaces/Northwestern/pages/McCarty-Pei Neg/objects/Admin.EntryClass/')" value="Delete" title="Delete" style="float:right;" src="/xwiki/resources/icons/silk/cross.gif" />

A brief characterization of incentives is therefore warranted. First, the term is understood by economists as incorporating both positive and negative aspects, for example a tax that leads a consumer to give up an activity that is an incentive, not a disincentive or negative incentive. Second, although incentives are also construed purely in economic terms, incentives refer to more than just financial rewards and penalties.

During the initial stages of the crisis, multiple analysts asserted that the financial crisis would lead states to increase their use of force as a tool for staying in power.37 Whether through greater internal repression, diversionary wars, arms races, or a ratcheting up of great power conflict, there were genuine concerns that the global economic downturn would lead to an increase in conflict. Violence in the Middle East, border disputes in the South China Sea, and even the disruptions of the Occupy movement fuel impressions of surge in global public disorder. <br/>The aggregate data suggests otherwise, however. The Institute for Economics and Peace has constructed a “Global Peace Index” annually since 2007. A key conclusion they draw from the 2012 report is that “The average level of peacefulness in 2012 is approximately the same as it was in 2007.”38 Interstate violence in particular has declined since the start of the financial crisis – as have military expenditures in most sampled countries. Other studies confirm that the Great Recession has not triggered any increase in violent conflict; the secular decline in violence that started with the end of the Cold War has not been reversed.39 Rogers Brubaker concludes, “the crisis has not to date generated the surge in protectionist nationalism or ethnic exclusion that might have been expected.”40<br/>None of these data suggest that the global economy is operating swimmingly. Growth remains unbalanced and fragile, and has clearly slowed in 2012. Transnational capital flows remain depressed compared to pre-crisis levels, primarily due to a drying up of cross-border interbank lending in Europe. Currency volatility remains an ongoing concern. Compared to the aftermath of other postwar recessions, growth in output, investment, and employment in the developed world have all lagged behind. But the Great Recession is not like other postwar recessions in either scope or kind; expecting a standard “V”-shaped recovery was unreasonable. One financial analyst characterized the post-2008 global economy as in a state of “contained depression.”41 The key word is “contained,” however. Given the severity, reach and depth of the 2008 financial crisis, the proper comparison is with Great Depression. And by that standard, the outcome variables look impressive. As Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff concluded in This Time is Different: “that its macroeconomic outcome has been only the most severe global recession since World War II – and not even worse – must be regarded as fortunate.”42</p><p>AT: Manufacturing<br/>US manufacturing is high and resilient---it can adapt to shocks to the system<br/>Skie 9-6 – Erik Skie, Manufacturing and Distribution Managing Partner at CliftonLarsonAllen, law firm, September 6th, 2012, “Survey Shows Resilient Manufacturing Sector Is Adapting to New Environment” www.cliftonlarsonallen.com/Manufacturing/Survey-Shows-Resilient-Manufacturing-Sector-Is-Adapting-to-New-Environment.aspx &nbsp;<br/>Over the last several decades, U.S. manufacturers have faced an onslaught of challenges that had led many to predict the eventual demise of U.S. manufacturing. As recently as five years ago, the conventional wisdom was that the United States could not compete with the low labor costs in countries like China, Vietnam, and India. In addition, purchasing tactics like those implemented by the “big three” auto companies underscored the perspective that life as a manufacturer would be precarious at best.¶ The dynamic shifts in this industry are almost unparalleled in any other sector of our economy. Interestingly, though, in a recent survey of almost 400 small to mid-sized manufacturers across the country, most have returned to financial stability after the Great Recession and are focused on future opportunities.¶ Stiff competition has produced a U.S. manufacturing base that is innovative, adaptable, and resilient in the face of adversity. Since August 2009, the Institute of Supply Chain Management’s (ISM) Manufacturing Production Index (PMI), a measure of manufacturing activity in the United States, has shown expansion for 33 of the past 35 months.¶ Here are some survey respondents’ observations on opportunities and challenges in today’s manufacturing industry.¶ Expanding domestic sales¶ Over the past decade the trend has been to send work to low cost-producers overseas. However, the anticipated profit improvements of off-shoring, which are primarily driven by lower wages, have sometimes been elusive due to collateral issues like longer lead times, less flexibility, and the need to carry more inventory. While there is still a clear role for overseas production, more companies have turned to re-shoring in the past 24 months for their more complex, design intensive, lower volume, and higher mix products. The need for supply chain intimacy is creating renewed demand for flexible, responsive U.S. domestic production.¶ International sales¶ The U.S. manufacturing base has been the home for tremendous product innovations for many years. As globalization has increased, the middle class in places like China is growing rapidly and turning a once producer-only economy into a nation of consumers. China’s increased consumption of U.S. brands and technology has been a blessing for U.S. manufacturers like General Motors. The aerospace industry is benefitting as well, with Boeing seeing significant backlog for their products in China.<br/>AT: Protectionism<br/>The public won’t tolerate protectionism/lashout <br/>Daniel W.

A general assumption in public opinion research is that during a downturn, demand for greater economic closure should spike, as individuals scapegoat foreigners for domestic woes. The global nature of the 2008 crisis, combined with anxiety about the shifting distribution of power, should have triggered a fall in support for an open global economy. Somewhat surprisingly, however, the reverse is true. Pew’s Global Attitudes Project has surveyed a wide spectrum of countries since 2002, asking people about their opinions on both international trade and the free market more generally.35 The results show resilient support for expanding trade and business ties with other countries. 24 countries were surveyed in both 2007 and in at least one year after 2008, including a majority of the G-20 economies. Overall, 18 of those 24 countries showed equal or greater support for trade in 2009 than two years earlier. By 2011, 20 of 24 countries showed greater or equal support for trade compared to 2007. Indeed, between 2007 and 2012, the unweighted average support for more trade in these countries increased from 78.5% to 83.6%. Contrary to expectation, there has been no mass public rejection of the open global economy. Indeed, public support for the open trading system has strengthened, despite softening public support for freemarket economics more generally.36</p><p>CO2 Ag<br/>Best CO2 fertilization card yet <br/>Craig Idso 7, founder and chairman of the board of the Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change, member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, American Geophysical Union, American Meteorological Society, Arizona-Nevada Academy of Sciences, and Association of American Geographers; and Sherwood Idso, research physicist with the USDA's Agricultural Research Service at the US Water Conservation Laboratory and adjunct professor at the ASU Office of Climatology; June 6, 2007, “Carbon Dioxide and Global Change: Separating Scientific Fact from Personal Opinion,” online: <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../heartland.org/sites/all/modules/custom/heartland_migration/files/pdfs/21556.pdf" tppabs="http://heartland.org/sites/all/modules/custom/heartland_migration/files/pdfs/21556.pdf"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://heartland.org/sites/all/modules/custom/heartland_migration/files/pdfs/21556.pdf</span></a></span><br/>How much land can ten billion people spare for nature? This provocative question was posed by Waggoner (1995) in an insightful essay wherein he explored the dynamic tension that exists between the need for land to support the agricultural enterprises that sustain mankind, and the need for land to support the natural ecosystems that sustain all other creatures. This challenge of meeting our future food needs – and not decimating the rest of the biosphere in the process – was stressed even more strongly by Huang et al. (2002), who wrote that humans “have encroached on almost all of the world's frontiers, leaving little new land that is cultivatable.” And in consequence of humanity's usurpation of this most basic of natural resources, Raven (2002) stated in his Presidential Address to the American Association for the Advancement of Science that “species-area relationships, taken worldwide in relation to habitat destruction, lead to projections of the loss of fully two-thirds of all species on earth by the end of this century.” &nbsp;<br/>In a more detailed analysis of the nature and implications of this impending “global landgrab” – which moved it closer to the present by a full half-century – Tilman et al. (2001) concluded that the task of meeting the doubled world food demand, which they calculated would exist in the year 2050, would likely exact a toll that “may rival climate change in environmental and societal impacts.” But how could something so catastrophic manifest itself so soon? &nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>Tilman and his nine collaborators shed some light on this question by noting that at the end of the 20th century mankind was already appropriating “more than a third of the production of terrestrial ecosystems and about half of usable freshwaters.” Now, think of doubling those figures, in order to meet the doubled global food demand that Tilman et al. predict for the year 2050. The results suggest that a mere 43 years from now mankind will be appropriating more than two thirds of terrestrial ecosystem production plus all of earth’s remaining usable freshwater, as has also been discussed by Wallace (2000). In terms of land devoted to agriculture, Tilman et al. calculate a much less ominous 18% increase by the year 2050. However, because most developed countries are projected to withdraw large areas of land from farming over the next fifty years, the loss of natural ecosystems to crops and pastures in developing countries will amount to about half of their remaining suitable land, which would, in the words of the Tilman team, “represent the worldwide loss of natural ecosystems larger than the United States.” What is more, they say that these land usurpations “could lead to the loss of about a third of remaining tropical and temperate forests, savannas, and grasslands.” And in a worrisome reflection upon the consequences of these land-use changes, they remind us that “species extinction is an irreversible impact of habitat destruction.” <br/>What can be done to avoid this horrific situation? In a subsequent analysis, Tilman et al. (2002) introduced a few more facts before suggesting some solutions. First of all, they noted that by 2050 the human population of the globe is projected to be 50% larger than it was just prior to the writing of their paper, and that global grain demand by 2050 could well double, due to expected increases in per capita real income and dietary shifts toward a higher proportion of meat. Hence, they but stated the obvious when they concluded that “raising yields on existing farmland is essential for ‘saving land for nature’.” So how can this readily-defined but Herculean task be accomplished? Tilman et al. proposed a strategy that focuses on three essential efforts: (1) increasing crop yield per unit of land area, (2) increasing crop yield per unit of nutrients applied, and (3) increasing crop yield per unit of water used. <br/>With respect to the first of these efforts – increasing crop yield per unit of land area – the researchers note that in many parts of the world the historical rate-of-increase in crop yield is declining, as the genetic ceiling for maximal yield potential is being approached. This observation, in their estimation, “highlights the need for efforts to steadily increase the yield potential ceiling.” With respect to the second effort – increasing crop yield per unit of nutrients applied – they note that “without the use of synthetic fertilizers, world food production could not have increased at the rate that it did in the past and more natural ecosystems would have been converted to agriculture.” Hence, they say that the ultimate solution “will require significant increases in nutrient use efficiency, that is, in cereal production per unit of added nitrogen.” Finally, with respect to the third effort – increasing crop yield per unit of water used – Tilman et al. note that “water is regionally scarce,” and that “many countries in a band from China through India and Pakistan, and the Middle East to North Africa either currently or will soon fail to have adequate water to maintain per capita food production from irrigated land.” Increasing crop water use efficiency, therefore, is also a must. <br/>Although the impending man vs. nature crisis and several important elements of its potential solution are thus well defined, Tilman and his first set of collaborators concluded that “even the best available technologies, fully deployed, cannot prevent many of the forecasted problems.” This was also the finding of Idso and Idso (2000), who concluded that although “expected advances in agricultural technology and expertise will significantly increase the food production potential of many countries and regions,” these advances “will not increase production fast enough to meet the demands of the even faster-growing human population of the planet.” <br/>How can we prevent this unthinkable catastrophe from occurring, especially when it has been concluded by highly-credentialed researchers that earth possesses insufficient land and freshwater resources to forestall it, while simultaneously retaining any semblance of the natural world and its myriad animate creations? Although the task may appear next to impossible to accomplish, it can be done; for we have a powerful ally in the ongoing rise in the atmosphere’s CO2 concentration that can provide what we can't. <br/>Since atmospheric CO2 is the basic “food” of nearly all plants, the more of it there is in the air, the better they function and the more productive they become. For a 300-ppm increase in the atmosphere's CO2 concentration above the planet’s current base level of slightly less than 400 ppm, for example, the productivity of earth's herbaceous plants rises by something on the order of 30% (Kimball, 1983; Idso and Idso, 1994), while the productivity of its woody plants rises by something on the order of 50% (Saxe et al., 1998; Idso and Kimball, 2001). Thus, as the air's CO2 content continues to rise, so too will the productive capacity or land-use efficiency of the planet continue to rise, as the aerial fertilization effect of the upward-trending atmospheric CO2 concentration boosts the growth rates and biomass production of nearly all plants in nearly all places. In addition, elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations typically increase plant nutrient-use efficiency in general – and nitrogen-use efficiency in particular – as well as plant wateruse efficiency, as may be verified by perusing the many reviews of scientific journal articles we have produced on these topics and archived in the Subject Index of our website (www.co2science.org). Consequently, with respect to fostering all three of the plant physiological phenomena that Tilman et al. (2002) contend are needed to prevent the catastrophic consequences they foresee for the planet just a few short decades from now, a continuation of the current upward trend in the atmosphere's CO2 concentration would appear to be essential. &nbsp;<br/>In the case we are considering here, for example, the degree of crop yield enhancement likely to be provided by the increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration expected to occur between 2000 and 2050 has been calculated by Idso and Idso (2000) to be sufficient – but only by the slightest of margins – to compensate for the huge differential that is expected to otherwise prevail between the supply and demand for food earmarked for human consumption just 43 years from now. Consequently, letting the evolution of technology take its natural course, with respect to anthropogenic CO2 emissions, would appear to be the only way we will ever be able to produce sufficient agricultural commodities to support ourselves in the year 2050 without the taking of unconscionable amounts of land and freshwater resources from nature and decimating the biosphere in the process. <br/>AT: Warming<br/>No impact---mitigation and adaptation will solve---no tipping point or “1% risk” args <br/>Robert O.

Millions of people might be vulnerable to health effects (IPCC 2007b), crop production might fall in the low latitudes (IPCC 2007b), water supplies might dwindle (IPCC 2007b), precipitation might fall in arid regions (IPCC 2007b), extreme events will grow exponentially (Stern 2006), and between 20–30 percent of species will risk extinction (IPCC 2007b). Even worse, there may be catastrophic events such as the melting of Greenland or Antarctic ice sheets causing severe sea level rise, which would inundate hundreds of millions of people (Dasgupta et al. 2009). Proponents argue there is no time to waste. Unless greenhouse gases are cut dramatically today, economic growth and well‐being may be at risk (Stern 2006).<br/>These statements are largely alarmist and misleading. Although climate change is a serious problem that deserves attention, society’s immediate behavior has an extremely low probability of leading to catastrophic consequences. The science and economics of climate change is quite clear that emissions over the next few decades will lead to only mild consequences. The severe impacts predicted by alarmists require a century (or two in the case of Stern 2006) of no mitigation. Many of the predicted impacts assume there will be no or little adaptation. The net economic impacts from climate change over the next 50 years will be small regardless. Most of the more severe impacts will take more than a century or even a millennium to unfold and many of these “potential” impacts will never occur because people will adapt. It is not at all apparent that immediate and dramatic policies need to be developed to thwart long‐range climate risks. What is needed are long‐run balanced responses.</p><p>No extinction from climate change <br/>NIPCC 11 – the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change, an international panel of nongovernment scientists and scholars, March 8, 2011, “Surviving the Unprecedented Climate Change of the IPCC,” online: <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../www.nipccreport.org/articles/2011/mar/8mar2011a5.html" tppabs="http://www.nipccreport.org/articles/2011/mar/8mar2011a5.html"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.nipccreport.org/articles/2011/mar/8mar2011a5.html</span></a></span><br/>In a paper published in Systematics and Biodiversity, Willis et al. (2010) consider the IPCC (2007) "predicted climatic changes for the next century" -- i.e., their contentions that "global temperatures will increase by 2-4°C and possibly beyond, sea levels will rise (1 m ± 0.5 m), and atmospheric CO2 will increase by up to 1000 ppm" -- noting that it is "widely suggested that the magnitude and rate of these changes will result in many plants and animals going extinct," citing studies that suggest that "within the next century, over 35% of some biota will have gone extinct (Thomas et al., 2004; Solomon et al., 2007) and there will be extensive die-back of the tropical rainforest due to climate change (e.g. Huntingford et al., 2008)."<br/>On the other hand, they indicate that some biologists and climatologists have pointed out that "many of the predicted increases in climate have happened before, in terms of both magnitude and rate of change (e.g. Royer, 2008; Zachos et al., 2008), and yet biotic communities have remained remarkably resilient (Mayle and Power, 2008) and in some cases thrived (Svenning and Condit, 2008)." But they report that those who mention these things are often "placed in the 'climate-change denier' category," although the purpose for pointing out these facts is simply to present "a sound scientific basis for understanding biotic responses to the magnitudes and rates of climate change predicted for the future through using the vast data resource that we can exploit in fossil records."<br/>Going on to do just that, Willis et al. focus on "intervals in time in the fossil record when atmospheric CO2 concentrations increased up to 1200 ppm, temperatures in mid- to high-latitudes increased by greater than 4°C within 60 years, and sea levels rose by up to 3 m higher than present," describing studies of past biotic responses that indicate "the scale and impact of the magnitude and rate of such climate changes on biodiversity." And what emerges from those studies, as they describe it, "is evidence for rapid community turnover, migrations, development of novel ecosystems and thresholds from one stable ecosystem state to another." And, most importantly in this regard, they report "there is very little evidence for broad-scale extinctions due to a warming world."<br/>In concluding, the Norwegian, Swedish and UK researchers say that "based on such evidence we urge some caution in assuming broad-scale extinctions of species will occur due solely to climate changes of the magnitude and rate predicted for the next century," reiterating that "the fossil record indicates remarkable biotic resilience to wide amplitude fluctuations in climate."</p><p>AT: Oceans<br/>No ocean acidification impact---CO2’s impact is positive on most marine life <br/>Craig Idso et al 12, founder and chairman of the board of the Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change, member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, American Geophysical Union, American Meteorological Society, Arizona-Nevada Academy of Sciences, and Association of American Geographers; Sherwood Idso, research physicist with the USDA's Agricultural Research Service at the US Water Conservation Laboratory and adjunct professor at the ASU Office of Climatology; and Keith Idso, Vice President of the Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change, July 11, 2012, “The Potential for Adaptive Evolution to Enable the World's Most Important Calcifying Organism to Cope with Ocean Acidification,” CO2 Science, Vol. 15, No. 28<br/>In an important paper published in the May 2012 issue of Nature Geoscience, Lohbeck et al. write that "our present understanding of the sensitivity of marine life to ocean acidification is based primarily on short-term experiments," which often depict negative effects. However, they go on to say that phytoplanktonic species with short generation times "may be able to respond to environmental alterations through adaptive evolution." And with this tantalizing possibility in mind, they studied, as they describe it, "the ability of the world's single most important calcifying organism, the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi, to evolve in response to ocean acidification in two 500-generation selection experiments."<br/>Working with freshly isolated genotypes from Bergen, Norway, the three German researchers grew them in batch cultures over some 500 asexual generations at three different atmospheric CO2 concentrations - ambient (400 ppm), medium (1100 ppm) and high (2200 ppm) - where the medium CO2 treatment was chosen to represent the atmospheric CO2 level projected for the beginning of the next century. This they did in a multi-clone experiment designed to provide existing genetic variation that they said "would be readily available to genotypic selection," as well as in a single-clone experiment that was initiated with one "haphazardly chosen genotype," where evolutionary adaptation would obviously require new mutations. So what did they learn?<br/>Compared with populations kept at ambient CO2 partial pressure, Lohbeck et al. found that those selected at increased CO2 levels "exhibited higher growth rates, in both the single- and multi-clone experiment, when tested under ocean acidification conditions." Calcification rates, on the other hand, were somewhat lower under CO2-enriched conditions in all cultures; but the research team reports that they were "up to 50% higher in adapted medium and high CO2 compared with non-adapted cultures." And when all was said and done, they concluded that "contemporary evolution could help to maintain the functionality of microbial processes at the base of marine food webs in the face of global change our italics." <br/>In other ruminations on their findings, the marine biologists indicate that what they call the swift adaptation processes they observed may "have the potential to affect food-web dynamics and biogeochemical cycles on timescales of a few years, thus surpassing predicted rates of ongoing global change including ocean acidification." And they also note, in this regard, that "a recent study reports surprisingly high coccolith mass in an E. huxleyi population off Chile in high-CO2 waters (Beaufort et al., 2011)," which observation is said by them to be indicative of "across-population variation in calcification, in line with findings of rapid microevolution identified here."<br/>China<br/>AT: South China Seas<br/>No SCS escalation---China can’t project power, US intervention solves <br/>James Dobbins 12, directs the International Security and Defense Policy Center at the RAND Corporation, previously served as American Ambassador to the European Community and Assistant Secretary of State, August/September 2012, “War with China,” Survival, Vol. 54, No. 4, p. 7-24<br/>Depending on the nature and severity of a conflict, US objectives could range from enforcing freedom of navigation against a Chinese effort to control maritime activities in the South China Sea, to helping the Philippines defend itself against an air and maritime attack, to supporting Vietnam and shielding Thailand (another treaty ally) in the event of a land war in Southeast Asia.<br/>Any likely contingency in the South China Sea or Southeast Asia would make demands on US air and naval power to assure friendly dominance of the battlespace. A war on land could create a demand for US land forces, especially special-forces and forced-entry capabilities.<br/>China’s current ability to project substantial power into the South China Sea region is limited; in particular, China’s land-based combat aircraft lack adequate range to operate efficiently so far from home. This assessment will change if China builds aircraft-carrier and air-refuelling capabilities in the coming years. Direct defence in the South China Sea and Southeast Asia should remain a viable strategy for the next 20 years.<br/>No SCS conflict escalation---economics check---our ev assumes squo instability<br/>Creehan 12 – Senior Editor of the SAIS Review of International Affairs (Sean, “Assessing the Risks of Conflict in the South China Sea,” Winter/Spring, SAIS Review, Vol. 32, No. 1)<br/>Regarding Secretary Clinton’s first requirement, the risk of actual closure of the South China Sea remains remote, as instability in the region would affect the entire global economy, raising the price of various goods and commodities. According to some estimates, for example, as much as 50 percent of global oil tanker shipments pass through the South China Sea— that represents more than three times the tanker traffic through the Suez Canal and over five times the tanker traffic through the Panama Canal.4 It is in no country’s interest to see instability there, least of all China’s, given the central economic importance of Chinese exports originating from the country’s major southern ports and energy imports coming through the South China Sea (annual U.S. trade passing through the Sea amounts to $1.2 trillion).5 Invoking the language of nuclear deterrence theory, disruption in these sea lanes implies mutually assured economic destruction, and that possibility should moderate the behavior of all participants. Furthermore, with the United States continuing to operate from a position of naval strength (or at least managing a broader alliance that collectively balances China’s naval presence in the future), the sea lanes will remain open. While small military disputes within such a balance of power are, of course, possible, the economic risks of extended conflict are so great that significant changes to the status quo are unlikely. <br/>AT: Relations<br/>No impact to U.S.-China cooperation---it’s impossible to sustain <br/>Aaron L. Friedberg 12, Professor of Politics and International Affairs at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University, September/October 2012, “Bucking Beijing,” Foreign Affairs, Vol. 91, No. 5, p. 48-58<br/>Recent events have raised serious doubts about both elements of this strategy. Decades of trade and talk have not hastened China's political liberalization. Indeed, the last few years have been marked by an intensified crackdown on domestic dissent. At the same time, the much-touted economic relationship between the two Pacific powers has become a major source of friction. And despite hopes for enhanced cooperation, Beijing has actually done very little to help Washington solve pressing international problems, such as North Korea's acquisition of nuclear weapons or Iran's attempts to develop them. Finally, far from accepting the status quo, China's leaders have become more forceful in attempting to control the waters and resources off their country's coasts. As for balancing, the continued buildup of China's military capabilities, coupled with impending cuts in U.S. defense spending, suggests that the regional distribution of power is set to shift sharply in Beijing's favor.<br/>WHY WE CAN'T ALL JUST GET ALONG<br/>TODAY, CHINA'S ruling elites are both arrogant and insecure. In their view, continued rule by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is essential to China's stability, prosperity, and prestige; it is also, not coincidentally, vital to their own safety and comfort. Although they have largely accepted some form of capitalism in the economic sphere, they remain committed to preserving their hold on political power.<br/>The CCP'S determination to maintain control informs the regime's threat perceptions, goals, and policies. Anxious about their legitimacy, China's rulers are eager to portray themselves as defenders of the national honor. Although they believe China is on track to become a world power on par with the United States, they remain deeply fearful of encirclement and ideological subversion. And despite Washington's attempts to reassure them of its benign intentions, Chinese leaders are convinced that the United States aims to block China's rise and, ultimately, undermine its one-party system of government.¶ Like the United States, since the end of the Cold War, China has pursued an essentially constant approach toward its greatest external challenger. For the most part, Beijing has sought to avoid outright confrontation with the United States while pursuing economic growth and building up all the elements of its "comprehensive national power," a Chinese strategic concept that encompasses military strength, technological prowess, and diplomatic influence. Even as they remain on the defensive, however, Chinese officials have not been content to remain passive. They have sought incremental advances, slowly expanding China's sphere of influence and strengthening its position in Asia while working quietly to erode that of the United States. Although they are careful never to say so directly, they seek to have China displace the United States in the long run and to restore China to what they regard as its rightful place as the preponderant regional power. Chinese strategists do not believe that they can achieve this objective quickly or through a frontal assault. Instead, they seek to reassure their neighbors, relying on the attractive force of China's massive economy to counter nascent balancing efforts against it. Following the advice of the ancient military strategist Sun-tzu, Beijing aims to "win without fighting," gradually creating a situation in which overt resistance to its wishes will appear futile.<br/>The failure to date to achieve a genuine entente between the United States and China is the result not of a lack of effort but of a fundamental divergence of interests. Although limited cooperation on specific issues might be possible, the ideological gap between the two nations is simply too great, and the level of trust between them too low, to permit a stable modus vivendi. What China's current leaders ultimately want -- regional hegemony -- is not something their counterparts in Washington are willing to give. That would run counter to an axiomatic goal of U.S. grand strategy, which has remained constant for decades: to prevent the domination of either end of the Eurasian landmass by one or more potentially hostile powers.<br/>The reasons for this goal involve a mix of strategic, economic, and ideological considerations that will continue to be valid into the foreseeable future.<br/>US solar tariffs make cooperation impossible<br/>AP 5/19/12 “Ruling adds to China trade tension: POSSIBLE U.S. TARIFFS ON SOLAR-PANEL IMPORTS MAY THREATEN CLEAN ENERGY COOPERATION,” <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../www.stltoday.com/business/local/ruling-adds-to-china-trade-tension/article_c7071e82-78b7-5d95-b943-a8c6e5cc93de.html" tppabs="http://www.stltoday.com/business/local/ruling-adds-to-china-trade-tension/article_c7071e82-78b7-5d95-b943-a8c6e5cc93de.html"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.stltoday.com/business/local/ruling-adds-to-china-trade-tension/article_c7071e82-78b7-5d95-b943-a8c6e5cc93de.html</span></a></span><br/>POSSIBLE U.S. TARIFFS ON SOLAR-PANEL IMPORTS MAY THREATEN CLEAN ENERGY COOPERATION¶ BEIJING • China's government on Friday rejected a U.S. antidumping ruling against its makers of solar power equipment, and Chinese manufacturers warned possible higher tariffs might hurt efforts to promote clean energy.¶ The conflict has worsened U.S.-Chinese trade tensions.

Molycorp has secured the permits and funding needed to restart production at a mine in Mountain Pass, California, that would become the first U.S. source of rare earth elements in more than a decade. The mine is one of the world's richest deposits of these elements, which are critical for making components found in a wide range of technologies. On Tuesday, the company announced that it will partner with Hitachi Metals of Japan to turn materials from the mine into high-strength magnets, which are vital in electric vehicles, wind turbines, and many other products. China currently has a lock on the market for rare earth materials: in 2009 it provided 95 percent of the world's supply, or 120,000 tons. This concentration of supply has become a major issue in recent months, particularly after China temporarily blocked exports of these materials to Japan in September. A Critical Materials Strategy document issued by the U.S. Department of Energy last week points to the "risk of supply disruption" in the short term. Worldwide demand for rare earth elements was 125,000 tons in 2010 and is expected to rise to 225,000 tons by 2015. The mine is a 50-acre open pit about 50 miles outside Las Vegas, surrounded by a stark landscape of red-brown mountains, Joshua trees, and the occasional cactus. Molycorp has begun draining groundwater that seeps into the bottom of the pit and removing areas of rock called "overburden" to expose a layer of bastnäsite, a mineral rich in rare earth elements. Expansion of operations will push the mine from a depth of 500 feet to 1,000 feet in the coming years. By 2012, the revamped U.S. mine is expected to produce around 20,000 tons of rare earth materials per year. Molycorp plans to use new processing techniques that it claims are more environmentally friendly and less expensive than conventional methods. The Mountain Pass mine used to be the world's biggest supplier of rare earth elements, but it closed in 2004, after a 1998 wastewater leak and the arrival of Chinese suppliers that offered lower prices. (One reason for the lower prices is that nearly half the rare earths produced in China are made as a by-product of iron mining.) Molycorp expects to sell about 3,000 tons of rare earths this year, produced from ore stockpiled before the mine was closed. It is also gearing up for active mining, with financial support from an initial public offering this summer and recent investment from Japanese firm Sumimoto. The company's total projected production could meet the current demand for rare earths in the United States. Molycorp has not disclosed who its customers will be, but CEO Mark Smith said on a tour of the mine last week that it has inked contracts to sell 25 percent of the 20,000 tons of material it expects to produce during the first year of full-scale operations, in 2012, and has letters of intent to sell the rest. "We're focused on the U.S., Japanese, and European markets," he said. Under current permits, the company could potentially double production, to 40,000 tons a year, beyond 2012. Smith says demand is likely to exceed supply for some years to come, even if Lynas Corporation's Mount Weld mine outside Perth, Australia, begins production as expected in summer 2011. That company expects to produce 15,000 tons of rare earth elements a year by 2015.</p><p>AT: Primacy<br/>No impact to nuclear arsenal cuts or nuclear primacy<br/>Elkind 12 – David J.

The preceding analysis assumes that the United States is in possession of perfect intelligence on the locations and attributes of Russian nuclear weapons facilities and is able to carry out such an attack unhindered by air- or missile-defenses (and concludes such an attack is ill-advised despite possessing perfect information). Even if mobile missiles do not continuously patrol, it would make sense for Russia to shuttle them from one garrison to another in order to decrease Russia’s opponents’ confidence in accounting for all of them. Furthermore, Russia’s decision to deploy its mobile forces in the event of a crisis (or continuously as a matter of policy) could spark concerns in Washington that either a Russian attack is immanent or simply that United States’ confidence in a first-strike option has evaporated, creating further perceptions of insecurity and upsetting the strategic environment which, in the mind of US policymakers, has assumed nuclear primacy. What’s more, mobile deployments are a cheap, easy countermeasure that would effectively negate the confidence gained (such as any is gained) from believing that the United States has nuclear primacy. Achieving, and then maintaining, a position of primacy introduces several significant strategic concerns of its own, and would hardly enhance the security of the United States or the international system.¶ I would like to advance this line of argumentation one step further. If this model accurately reflects reality and a Liber and Press-style counterforce strike on Russia’s nuclear arsenal is unlikely to succeed, then deep cuts to the nuclear arsenal and the decision to abandon counterforce targeting gains credibility. That is, deep cuts to the nuclear arsenal would not mean abandoning counterforce doctrine because that has already happened. Simply put, attempting the counterforce attack would include an inescapable risk to the United States – and we can rest easier knowing that this is the case.</p><p>Nuclear modernization isn’t k2 deterrence<br/>Travis Sharp 10, Research Associate at the Center for a New American Security, “The Numbers Game”, Nukes of Hazard, Center for Arms Control and Nonproliferation, 2-24, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../www.nukesofhazardblog.com/story/2010/2/24/123221/390" tppabs="http://www.nukesofhazardblog.com/story/2010/2/24/123221/390"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.nukesofhazardblog.com/story/2010/2/24/123221/390</span></a></span><br/>This complaint is regularly expressed by Keith Payne, the paragon of conservative nuclear strategists. For instance, Payne wrote last year that “informed estimates about the functioning of deterrence must also include assessments of opponent decision-making processes, values, intentions, histories, levels of determination, goals, stakes and worldviews.” Since deterrence is not a quantifiable or scientific outcome, Payne concluded,¶ In the contemporary strategic environment, it is impossible to provide high-confidence, quantitatively precise and enduring answers to the question “how much is enough” for deterrence. The familiar game of linking some specific number of nuclear weapons with confidence in deterrence and the adequacy of U.S. strategic forces in general remains popular, but it now is unsupportable…even if done rigorously, identifying the requirements for deterrence is an incomplete basis for defining the necessary parameters for U.S. strategic forces in general.¶ Before considering whether this “numbers game” critique is justified, a comment is needed on Bolton’s and Payne’s methodology. Deterrence indubitably involves historical, cultural, psychological, and political calculations, as Payne suggests. NOH readers should recognize, however, that predicating deterrence on potential adversaries’ values, goals, stakes, and worldviews allows Bolton and Payne to configure U.S. nuclear forces according to how evil they perceive other countries to be. Do we really want to dismiss targeting-based deterrence analyses, such as Cimbala’s JFQ article and Lieber’s and Press’s Foreign Affairs appendix, as mere Cold War remnants and replace them with 1 inflammatory Ahmadinejad quote = 1 credible limited U.S. counterforce option? Payne is arguing, laudably, for recognizing deterrence’s complexity. Yet will an injection of red-blooded Manichaeism make U.S. nuclear policy more effective? I doubt it.¶ Payne is right that it is difficult to formulate “quantitatively precise” answers to deterrence questions, but that uncertainty doesn’t necessarily justify rounding up to the larger U.S. nuclear arsenal he would prefer. As Charles Glaser convincingly put it, “Deterrence is likely to be effective because, as was argued extensively during the Cold War, even relatively little credibility is sufficient when the costs of retaliation are so large.” In other words, a little nuke still goes a long way.<br/>Primacy Bad<br/>Primacy causes global arms races and nuclear war---perception of increased US capability causes enemies to preemptively strike first---also causes shifts in nuclear posture that causes unauthorized and accidental launch <br/>Elkind 12 – David J. Elkind is a research intern for the Project on Nuclear Issues. May 22nd, 2012, "American Nuclear Primacy: the End of MAD or a New START?" csis.org/blog/american-nuclear-primacy-end-mad-or-new-start<br/>Concluding Remarks¶ ¶ These results show that the United States cannot reasonably claim to have obtained nuclear primacy. Reductions in the two nations’ respective arsenals, coupled with the large number of Russian targets collaborate to make it exceptionally difficult to destroy the Russian arsenal in a counterforce first strike. Even though my results demonstrate a modest level of confidence in the baseline scenario, I believe that mutually assured destruction remains in place. Because the costs of even a single Russian warhead surviving would have such devastating consequences for the United States, I do not believe that any President or military planner would care to wager America’s most populous cities in conducting a nuclear first strike. While these results speak to the purely military considerations of that choice, the political, ethical and humanitarian considerations likewise make such an action highly unlikely.¶ ¶ Even though this article concludes that the US could not carry out a counterforce strike on the Russian arsenal in 2012, and therefore does not possess nuclear primacy, this should not be interpreted as a call to restart the arms race or otherwise acquire primacy. Liber and Press write that “the shift in the nuclear balance could significantly damage relations among the great powers and increase the probability of nuclear war,” and outline a variety of possible mechanisms by which this could come to pass and present rebuttals to counterarguments (interested readers should refer to Lieber and Press, “The End of MAD?” 31-38). To bridge the gap in nuclear capabilities, Russia and China may undertake perilous activities to restore the nuclear balance, such as pre-delegated launch authority, a launch-on-warning posture, or larger nuclear arsenals. Pre-delegated launch authority increases the risk of unauthorized nuclear use; Cold War experience confirms that launch-on-warning postures are vulnerable to false alarms initiating a counter-attack to imaginary missiles; arms races carry the risk that one side will perceive that it has gained the upper hand and undertake a nuclear first use. Furthermore, nuclear primacy carries considerable risks in times of crisis. In the event of a political crisis or a conventional war between the US and a rival power, the threat of a disarming strike by the United States may predispose the rival to land the first blow while it still has the means to do so. In this way, having a reduced confidence in the ability of the US to carry out a first strike should be read as a stabilizing feature of international politics, as strategic stability (if it had ever departed) has been restored as a pillar of the international system.¶ ¶ External to these considerations, achieving nuclear primacy would be a pyrrhic victory. The preceding analysis assumes that the United States is in possession of perfect intelligence on the locations and attributes of Russian nuclear weapons facilities and is able to carry out such an attack unhindered by air- or missile-defenses (and concludes such an attack is ill-advised despite possessing perfect information).
