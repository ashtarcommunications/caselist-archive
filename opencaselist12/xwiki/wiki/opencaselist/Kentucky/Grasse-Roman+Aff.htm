This will not be a replay of the 1930s, but a replay of the 1970s is a serious prospect. The world is in danger of undoing the market reforms of the 1980s and ’90s that brought unprecedented prosperity, especially to emerging markets outside the West. Like the 1970s, policy backsliding could prolong a severe downturn and compromise eventual recovery. The short-term challenge is to arrest the slide to Big Government at home and creeping protectionism abroad. The medium-term challenge is to get back on track with trade and FDI liberalisation combined with domestic structural reforms – substantial "unﬁnished business" left before the crisis struck. More, not less, markets and globalisation are what the world needs. That is primarily a matter for unilateral action by governments and competitive emulation among them. It can be reinforced by international policy cooperation in the WTO, G20 and other fora, but not too much can be expected of cumbersome global-governance mechanisms. Overall, limits to government intervention and a well-functioning market economy are of a piece with open markets, economic globalisation and international political stability.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HScenario2-EconomicCollapse:" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Scenario 2- Economic Collapse:</span></h4><p><strong>CFIUS is increasingly assertive over Chinese energy deals—-Casting a shadow over future investment&nbsp;</strong><br/><strong>Crooks-Financial Times-9/11/</strong>12<br/><span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/4f880244-f90a-11e1-945b-00144feabdc0.html~~#axzz26DtOgO5Z-http-/www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/4f880244-f90a-11e1-945b-00144feabdc0.html" tppabs="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/4f880244-f90a-11e1-945b-00144feabdc0.html~~%23axzz26DtOgO5Z-http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/4f880244-f90a-11e1-945b-00144feabdc0.html"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/4f880244-f90a-11e1-945b-00144feabdc0.html~~%23axzz26DtOgO5Z-http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/4f880244-f90a-11e1-945b-00144feabdc0.html</span></a></span><br/>Oil tie-up is test for US deal-watchers</p><p>Over the latest three years for which data are publicly available, Cfius required legally <br/>AND<br/>oil company owning assets that are a big deal here in the US."</p><h4 id="HAnd2Cenergyrestrictionsdestroyinvestorconfidence2Cwhichcrushesthedollarandtriggerseconomicrecession-thevagueCFIUSinterpretationofnationalsecuritychillsALLforeigninvestment." class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>And, energy restrictions destroy investor confidence, which crushes the dollar and triggers economic recession- the vague CFIUS interpretation of national security chills ALL foreign investment.</span></h4><p><strong>Carroll-Emory International Law Review-09</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(James, COMMENT: BACK TO THE FUTURE: REDEFINING THE FOREIGN INVESTMENT AND NATIONAL SECURITY ACT’S CONCEPTION OF NATIONAL SECURITY, 23 Emory Int’l L.

Why the difference? The shale gas boom that is now more than 10 years long in the USA is just getting started in China and so the Chinese remain heavily reliant on coal to make electricity and for their total energy. Around the world, the basic energy choice is coal or gas. China is just the biggest example of this fundamental fact. China’s reliance on coal means that its economic growth brings skyrocketing carbon emissions and other air pollution. Indeed, Chinese air quality is infamous around the world, and smog has been so thick that Beijing airport has been unable to land planes for short periods. As of 2011, China was responsible for 29% of the world’s carbon emissions, while the US produced 16%, even though the US economy is still considerably bigger than China’s. Moreover, US carbon emissions are declining to 1992 levels, but China’s emissions skyrocket. Though China is building substantial new wind, solar, and nuclear generation, those investments are not enough to cut Chinese coal consumption, given economic growth that is still 7% in what some describe as an economic slowdown. Shale gas, however, could be big enough to actually displace significant amounts of coal in China. More gas in China means less mercury, soot. lead, smog, and carbon emissions. China’s energy plans call for shale gas to provide 6% of its total energy as soon as 2020. &nbsp;If it achieves that goal, China will avoid more than 500 million tons of carbon pollution per year or about 1.5% of today’s total carbon emissions.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HIncreasingdemandforChinesecoalproductioncauseswatershortageswhichthreateneconomiccollapseandpoliticalinstability." class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Increasing demand for Chinese coal production causes water shortages which threaten economic collapse and political instability.</span></h4><p><strong>Schneider 11</strong> (Keith, senior editor for Circle of Blue-a nonprofit focusing on resource shortages founded in 2000, Choke Point: China—Confronting Water Scarcity and Energy Demand in the World’s Largest Country, Feb 15, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../www.circleofblue.org/waternews/2011/world/choke-point-china—confronting-water-scarcity-and-energy-demand-in-the-world’s-largest-country/)" tppabs="http://www.circleofblue.org/waternews/2011/world/choke-point-china%E2%80%94confronting-water-scarcity-and-energy-demand-in-the-world%E2%80%99s-largest-country/)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.circleofblue.org/waternews/2011/world/choke-point-china%E2%80%94confronting-water-scarcity-and-energy-demand-in-the-world%E2%80%99s-largest-country/)</span></a></span><br/>By any measure, conventional and otherwise, China’s tireless advance to international economic prominence <br/>AND<br/>rising incomes and improving opportunities, is at risk, say some authorities.</p><h4 id="HChineseeconomiccollapsecausesAsianandMiddleEastconflict-Chinawillturnoutwardlyaggressive." class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Chinese economic collapse causes Asian and Middle East conflict- China will turn outwardly aggressive.</span></h4><p><strong>Newmeyer 09&nbsp;</strong>DR.

This will not be a replay of the 1930s, but a replay of the 1970s is a serious prospect. The world is in danger of undoing the market reforms of the 1980s and ‘90s that brought unprecedented prosperity, especially to emerging markets outside the West. Like the 1970s, policy backsliding could prolong a severe downturn and compromise eventual recovery. The short-term challenge is to arrest the slide to Big Government at home and creeping protectionism abroad. The medium-term challenge is to get back on track with trade and FDI liberalisation combined with domestic structural reforms – substantial “unﬁnished business” left before the crisis struck. More, not less, markets and globalisation are what the world needs. That is primarily a matter for unilateral action by governments and competitive emulation among them. It can be reinforced by international policy cooperation in the WTO, G20 and other fora, but not too much can be expected of cumbersome global-governance mechanisms. Overall, limits to government intervention and a well-functioning market economy are of a piece with open markets, economic globalisation and international political stability.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p> <br/>Scenario 2- Economic Collapse:</p><p> <br/>Chinese FDI to the US declined sharply in 2012 but could rebound if the US takes steps to liberalize its national security FDI policy towards China.</p><p>Hanemann 12-28 (Theo, research director at the Rhodium Group and leads the firm’s cross-border investment work, Chinese FDI in the US in 2012, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../rhgroup.net/notes/chinese-direct-investmnet-in-the-u-s-in-2012-a-record-year-amid-a-gloomy-fdi-environment)" tppabs="http://rhgroup.net/notes/chinese-direct-investmnet-in-the-u-s-in-2012-a-record-year-amid-a-gloomy-fdi-environment)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://rhgroup.net/notes/chinese-direct-investmnet-in-the-u-s-in-2012-a-record-year-amid-a-gloomy-fdi-environment)</span></a></span></p><p>AGAINST THE GLOBAL TREND The recent growth of Chinese investment is even more remarkable in</p><p>AND</p><p>the United States remains a top destination for FDI from China and elsewhere.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But, CFIUS is increasingly assertive over Chinese energy deals---Casting a shadow over future investment</p><p>Crooks-Financial Times-9/11/12</p><p><span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/4f880244-f90a-11e1-945b-00144feabdc0.html#axzz26DtOgO5Z" tppabs="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/4f880244-f90a-11e1-945b-00144feabdc0.html#axzz26DtOgO5Z"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/4f880244-f90a-11e1-945b-00144feabdc0.html#axzz26DtOgO5Z</span></a></span></p><p>Oil tie-up is test for US deal-watchers</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Over the latest three years for which data are publicly available, Cfius required legally</p><p>AND</p><p>oil company owning assets that are a big deal here in the US.”<br/>And, energy restrictions destroy investor confidence, which crushes the dollar and triggers economic recession- the vague CFIUS interpretation of national security chills ALL foreign investment.</p><p>Carroll-Emory International Law Review-09 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(James, COMMENT: BACK TO THE FUTURE: REDEFINING THE FOREIGN INVESTMENT AND NATIONAL SECURITY ACT'S CONCEPTION OF NATIONAL SECURITY, 23 Emory Int'l L.

Why the difference? The shale gas boom that is now more than 10 years long in the USA is just getting started in China and so the Chinese remain heavily reliant on coal to make electricity and for their total energy. Around the world, the basic energy choice is coal or gas. China is just the biggest example of this fundamental fact. China's reliance on coal means that its economic growth brings skyrocketing carbon emissions and other air pollution. Indeed, Chinese air quality is infamous around the world, and smog has been so thick that Beijing airport has been unable to land planes for short periods. As of 2011, China was responsible for 29% of the world's carbon emissions, while the US produced 16%, even though the US economy is still considerably bigger than China's. Moreover, US carbon emissions are declining to 1992 levels, but China's emissions skyrocket. Though China is building substantial new wind, solar, and nuclear generation, those investments are not enough to cut Chinese coal consumption, given economic growth that is still 7% in what some describe as an economic slowdown. Shale gas, however, could be big enough to actually displace significant amounts of coal in China. More gas in China means less mercury, soot. lead, smog, and carbon emissions. China's energy plans call for shale gas to provide 6% of its total energy as soon as 2020. &nbsp;If it achieves that goal, China will avoid more than 500 million tons of carbon pollution per year or about 1.5% of today's total carbon emissions.</p><p> <br/>Increasing demand for Chinese coal production causes water shortages which threaten economic collapse and political instability.</p><p>Schneider 11 (Keith, senior editor for Circle of Blue-a nonprofit focusing on resource shortages founded in 2000, Choke Point: China—Confronting Water Scarcity and Energy Demand in the World’s Largest Country, Feb 15, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../www.circleofblue.org/waternews/2011/world/choke-point-china—confronting-water-scarcity-and-energy-demand-in-the-world’s-largest-country/)" tppabs="http://www.circleofblue.org/waternews/2011/world/choke-point-china%E2%80%94confronting-water-scarcity-and-energy-demand-in-the-world%E2%80%99s-largest-country/)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.circleofblue.org/waternews/2011/world/choke-point-china%E2%80%94confronting-water-scarcity-and-energy-demand-in-the-world%E2%80%99s-largest-country/)</span></a></span></p><p>By any measure, conventional and otherwise, China’s tireless advance to international economic prominence</p><p>AND</p><p>rising incomes and improving opportunities, is at risk, say some authorities.<br/>Chinese economic collapse causes Asian and Middle East conflict- China will turn outwardly aggressive.</p><p>Newmeyer 09 DR.

This will not be a replay of the 1930s, but a replay of the 1970s is a serious prospect. The world is in danger of undoing the market reforms of the 1980s and ’90s that brought unprecedented prosperity, especially to emerging markets outside the West. Like the 1970s, policy backsliding could prolong a severe downturn and compromise eventual recovery. The short-term challenge is to arrest the slide to Big Government at home and creeping protectionism abroad. The medium-term challenge is to get back on track with trade and FDI liberalisation combined with domestic structural reforms – substantial "unﬁnished business" left before the crisis struck. More, not less, markets and globalisation are what the world needs. That is primarily a matter for unilateral action by governments and competitive emulation among them. It can be reinforced by international policy cooperation in the WTO, G20 and other fora, but not too much can be expected of cumbersome global-governance mechanisms. Overall, limits to government intervention and a well-functioning market economy are of a piece with open markets, economic globalisation and international political stability.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HScenario2-EconomicCollapse:-1" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Scenario 2- Economic Collapse:</span></h4><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HChineseFDItotheUSdeclinedsharplyin2012butcouldreboundiftheUStakesstepstoliberalizeitsnationalsecurityFDIpolicytowardsChina." class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Chinese FDI to the US declined sharply in 2012 but could rebound if the US takes steps to liberalize its national security FDI policy towards China.</span></h4><p><strong>Hanemann 12-28</strong> (Theo, research director at the Rhodium Group and leads the firm’s cross-border investment work, Chinese FDI in the US in 2012, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../rhgroup.net/notes/chinese-direct-investmnet-in-the-u-s-in-2012-a-record-year-amid-a-gloomy-fdi-environment)" tppabs="http://rhgroup.net/notes/chinese-direct-investmnet-in-the-u-s-in-2012-a-record-year-amid-a-gloomy-fdi-environment)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://rhgroup.net/notes/chinese-direct-investmnet-in-the-u-s-in-2012-a-record-year-amid-a-gloomy-fdi-environment)</span></a></span><br/>AGAINST THE GLOBAL TREND The recent growth of Chinese investment is even more remarkable in <br/>AND<br/>the United States remains a top destination for FDI from China and elsewhere.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HAnd2Cenergyrestrictionsdestroyinvestorconfidence2Cwhichcrushesthedollarandtriggerseconomicrecession-thevagueCFIUSinterpretationofnationalsecuritychillsALLforeigninvestment.-1" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>And, energy restrictions destroy investor confidence, which crushes the dollar and triggers economic recession- the vague CFIUS interpretation of national security chills ALL foreign investment.</span></h4><p><strong>Carroll-Emory International Law Review-09</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(James, COMMENT: BACK TO THE FUTURE: REDEFINING THE FOREIGN INVESTMENT AND NATIONAL SECURITY ACT’S CONCEPTION OF NATIONAL SECURITY, 23 Emory Int’l L.

Why the difference? The shale gas boom that is now more than 10 years long in the USA is just getting started in China and so the Chinese remain heavily reliant on coal to make electricity and for their total energy. Around the world, the basic energy choice is coal or gas. China is just the biggest example of this fundamental fact. China’s reliance on coal means that its economic growth brings skyrocketing carbon emissions and other air pollution. Indeed, Chinese air quality is infamous around the world, and smog has been so thick that Beijing airport has been unable to land planes for short periods. As of 2011, China was responsible for 29% of the world’s carbon emissions, while the US produced 16%, even though the US economy is still considerably bigger than China’s. Moreover, US carbon emissions are declining to 1992 levels, but China’s emissions skyrocket. Though China is building substantial new wind, solar, and nuclear generation, those investments are not enough to cut Chinese coal consumption, given economic growth that is still 7% in what some describe as an economic slowdown. Shale gas, however, could be big enough to actually displace significant amounts of coal in China. More gas in China means less mercury, soot. lead, smog, and carbon emissions. China’s energy plans call for shale gas to provide 6% of its total energy as soon as 2020. &nbsp;If it achieves that goal, China will avoid more than 500 million tons of carbon pollution per year or about 1.5% of today’s total carbon emissions.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HIncreasingdemandforChinesecoalproductioncauseswatershortageswhichthreateneconomiccollapseandpoliticalinstability.-1" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Increasing demand for Chinese coal production causes water shortages which threaten economic collapse and political instability.</span></h4><p><strong>Schneider 11</strong> (Keith, senior editor for Circle of Blue-a nonprofit focusing on resource shortages founded in 2000, Choke Point: China—Confronting Water Scarcity and Energy Demand in the World’s Largest Country, Feb 15, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../www.circleofblue.org/waternews/2011/world/choke-point-china—confronting-water-scarcity-and-energy-demand-in-the-world’s-largest-country/)" tppabs="http://www.circleofblue.org/waternews/2011/world/choke-point-china%E2%80%94confronting-water-scarcity-and-energy-demand-in-the-world%E2%80%99s-largest-country/)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.circleofblue.org/waternews/2011/world/choke-point-china%E2%80%94confronting-water-scarcity-and-energy-demand-in-the-world%E2%80%99s-largest-country/)</span></a></span><br/>By any measure, conventional and otherwise, China’s tireless advance to international economic prominence <br/>AND<br/>rising incomes and improving opportunities, is at risk, say some authorities.</p><h4 id="HChineseeconomiccollapsecausesAsianandMiddleEastconflict-Chinawillturnoutwardlyaggressive.-1" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Chinese economic collapse causes Asian and Middle East conflict- China will turn outwardly aggressive.</span></h4><p><strong>Newmeyer 09&nbsp;</strong>DR.

This will not be a replay of the 1930s, but a replay of the 1970s is a serious prospect. The world is in danger of undoing the market reforms of the 1980s and ‘90s that brought unprecedented prosperity, especially to emerging markets outside the West. Like the 1970s, policy backsliding could prolong a severe downturn and compromise eventual recovery. The short-term challenge is to arrest the slide to Big Government at home and creeping protectionism abroad. The medium-term challenge is to get back on track with trade and FDI liberalisation combined with domestic structural reforms – substantial “unﬁnished business” left before the crisis struck. More, not less, markets and globalisation are what the world needs. That is primarily a matter for unilateral action by governments and competitive emulation among them. It can be reinforced by international policy cooperation in the WTO, G20 and other fora, but not too much can be expected of cumbersome global-governance mechanisms. Overall, limits to government intervention and a well-functioning market economy are of a piece with open markets, economic globalisation and international political stability.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>Scenario 2- Economic Collapse:</p><p>Chinese FDI to the US declined sharply in 2012 but could rebound if the US takes steps to liberalize its national security FDI policy towards China.<br/>Hanemann 12-28 (Theo, research director at the Rhodium Group and leads the firm’s cross-border investment work, Chinese FDI in the US in 2012, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../rhgroup.net/notes/chinese-direct-investmnet-in-the-u-s-in-2012-a-record-year-amid-a-gloomy-fdi-environment)" tppabs="http://rhgroup.net/notes/chinese-direct-investmnet-in-the-u-s-in-2012-a-record-year-amid-a-gloomy-fdi-environment)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://rhgroup.net/notes/chinese-direct-investmnet-in-the-u-s-in-2012-a-record-year-amid-a-gloomy-fdi-environment)</span></a></span><br/>AGAINST THE GLOBAL TREND The recent growth of Chinese investment is even more remarkable in <br/>AND<br/>the United States remains a top destination for FDI from China and elsewhere.</p><p>And investment is low overall – more of it is critical to jobs and growth <br/>Scissors and Payne 1/11/13 (Derek, Senior Research Fellow in Asia Economic Policy, and Dean Cheng is Research Fellow in Chinese Political and Security Affairs, *Amy, research associate at the Heritage Foundation, “Morning Bell: Chinese Investment in the U.S. Shatters Records” <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../blog.heritage.org/2013/01/11/china-investment-in-the-us-2012/)" tppabs="http://blog.heritage.org/2013/01/11/china-investment-in-the-us-2012/)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://blog.heritage.org/2013/01/11/china-investment-in-the-us-2012/)</span></a></span>&nbsp;</p><p>China set a record with its investments around the world in 2012.

Why the difference? The shale gas boom that is now more than 10 years long in the USA is just getting started in China and so the Chinese remain heavily reliant on coal to make electricity and for their total energy. Around the world, the basic energy choice is coal or gas. China is just the biggest example of this fundamental fact. China's reliance on coal means that its economic growth brings skyrocketing carbon emissions and other air pollution. Indeed, Chinese air quality is infamous around the world, and smog has been so thick that Beijing airport has been unable to land planes for short periods. As of 2011, China was responsible for 29% of the world's carbon emissions, while the US produced 16%, even though the US economy is still considerably bigger than China's. Moreover, US carbon emissions are declining to 1992 levels, but China's emissions skyrocket. Though China is building substantial new wind, solar, and nuclear generation, those investments are not enough to cut Chinese coal consumption, given economic growth that is still 7% in what some describe as an economic slowdown. Shale gas, however, could be big enough to actually displace significant amounts of coal in China. More gas in China means less mercury, soot. lead, smog, and carbon emissions. China's energy plans call for shale gas to provide 6% of its total energy as soon as 2020. &nbsp;If it achieves that goal, China will avoid more than 500 million tons of carbon pollution per year or about 1.5% of today's total carbon emissions.</p><p>Increasing demand for Chinese coal production causes water shortages which threaten economic collapse and political instability. <br/>Schneider 11 (Keith, senior editor for Circle of Blue-a nonprofit focusing on resource shortages founded in 2000, Choke Point: China—Confronting Water Scarcity and Energy Demand in the World’s Largest Country, Feb 15, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../www.circleofblue.org/waternews/2011/world/choke-point-china—confronting-water-scarcity-and-energy-demand-in-the-world’s-largest-country/)" tppabs="http://www.circleofblue.org/waternews/2011/world/choke-point-china%E2%80%94confronting-water-scarcity-and-energy-demand-in-the-world%E2%80%99s-largest-country/)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.circleofblue.org/waternews/2011/world/choke-point-china%E2%80%94confronting-water-scarcity-and-energy-demand-in-the-world%E2%80%99s-largest-country/)</span></a></span><br/>By any measure, conventional and otherwise, China’s tireless advance to international economic prominence <br/>AND<br/>rising incomes and improving opportunities, is at risk, say some authorities.<br/>Chinese economic collapse causes Asian and Middle East conflict- China will turn outwardly aggressive.<br/>Newmeyer 09 DR.

This will not be a replay of the 1930s, but a replay of the 1970s is a serious prospect. The world is in danger of undoing the market reforms of the 1980s and ’90s that brought unprecedented prosperity, especially to emerging markets outside the West. Like the 1970s, policy backsliding could prolong a severe downturn and compromise eventual recovery. The short-term challenge is to arrest the slide to Big Government at home and creeping protectionism abroad. The medium-term challenge is to get back on track with trade and FDI liberalisation combined with domestic structural reforms – substantial "unﬁnished business" left before the crisis struck. More, not less, markets and globalisation are what the world needs. That is primarily a matter for unilateral action by governments and competitive emulation among them. It can be reinforced by international policy cooperation in the WTO, G20 and other fora, but not too much can be expected of cumbersome global-governance mechanisms. Overall, limits to government intervention and a well-functioning market economy are of a piece with open markets, economic globalisation and international political stability.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HScenario2-EconomicCollapse:-2" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Scenario 2- Economic Collapse:</span></h4><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HChineseFDItotheUSdeclinedsharplyin2012butcouldreboundiftheUStakesstepstoliberalizeitsnationalsecurityFDIpolicytowardsChina.-1" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Chinese FDI to the US declined sharply in 2012 but could rebound if the US takes steps to liberalize its national security FDI policy towards China.</span></h4><p><strong>Hanemann 12-28</strong> (Theo, research director at the Rhodium Group and leads the firm’s cross-border investment work, Chinese FDI in the US in 2012, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../rhgroup.net/notes/chinese-direct-investmnet-in-the-u-s-in-2012-a-record-year-amid-a-gloomy-fdi-environment)" tppabs="http://rhgroup.net/notes/chinese-direct-investmnet-in-the-u-s-in-2012-a-record-year-amid-a-gloomy-fdi-environment)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://rhgroup.net/notes/chinese-direct-investmnet-in-the-u-s-in-2012-a-record-year-amid-a-gloomy-fdi-environment)</span></a></span><br/>AGAINST THE GLOBAL TREND The recent growth of Chinese investment is even more remarkable in <br/>AND<br/>the United States remains a top destination for FDI from China and elsewhere.</p><h4 id="HAndinvestmentislowoverall2013moreofitiscriticaltojobsandgrowth" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>And investment is low overall – more of it is critical to jobs and growth</span></h4><p>Scissors and Payne 1/11/13 (Derek, Senior Research Fellow in Asia Economic Policy, and Dean Cheng is Research Fellow in Chinese Political and Security Affairs, *Amy, research associate at the Heritage Foundation, "Morning Bell: Chinese Investment in the U.S. Shatters Records" <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../blog.heritage.org/2013/01/11/china-investment-in-the-us-2012/-http-/blog.heritage.org/2013/01/11/china-investment-in-the-us-2012/)" tppabs="http://blog.heritage.org/2013/01/11/china-investment-in-the-us-2012/-http://blog.heritage.org/2013/01/11/china-investment-in-the-us-2012/)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://blog.heritage.org/2013/01/11/china-investment-in-the-us-2012/-http://blog.heritage.org/2013/01/11/china-investment-in-the-us-2012/)</span></a></span>&nbsp;</p><p>China set a record with its investments around the world in 2012.

Why the difference? The shale gas boom that is now more than 10 years long in the USA is just getting started in China and so the Chinese remain heavily reliant on coal to make electricity and for their total energy. Around the world, the basic energy choice is coal or gas. China is just the biggest example of this fundamental fact. China’s reliance on coal means that its economic growth brings skyrocketing carbon emissions and other air pollution. Indeed, Chinese air quality is infamous around the world, and smog has been so thick that Beijing airport has been unable to land planes for short periods. As of 2011, China was responsible for 29% of the world’s carbon emissions, while the US produced 16%, even though the US economy is still considerably bigger than China’s. Moreover, US carbon emissions are declining to 1992 levels, but China’s emissions skyrocket. Though China is building substantial new wind, solar, and nuclear generation, those investments are not enough to cut Chinese coal consumption, given economic growth that is still 7% in what some describe as an economic slowdown. Shale gas, however, could be big enough to actually displace significant amounts of coal in China. More gas in China means less mercury, soot. lead, smog, and carbon emissions. China’s energy plans call for shale gas to provide 6% of its total energy as soon as 2020. &nbsp;If it achieves that goal, China will avoid more than 500 million tons of carbon pollution per year or about 1.5% of today’s total carbon emissions.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HIncreasingdemandforChinesecoalproductioncauseswatershortageswhichthreateneconomiccollapseandpoliticalinstability.-2" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Increasing demand for Chinese coal production causes water shortages which threaten economic collapse and political instability.</span></h4><p><strong>Schneider 11</strong> (Keith, senior editor for Circle of Blue-a nonprofit focusing on resource shortages founded in 2000, Choke Point: China—Confronting Water Scarcity and Energy Demand in the World’s Largest Country, Feb 15, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../www.circleofblue.org/waternews/2011/world/choke-point-china—confronting-water-scarcity-and-energy-demand-in-the-world’s-largest-country/)" tppabs="http://www.circleofblue.org/waternews/2011/world/choke-point-china%E2%80%94confronting-water-scarcity-and-energy-demand-in-the-world%E2%80%99s-largest-country/)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.circleofblue.org/waternews/2011/world/choke-point-china%E2%80%94confronting-water-scarcity-and-energy-demand-in-the-world%E2%80%99s-largest-country/)</span></a></span><br/>By any measure, conventional and otherwise, China’s tireless advance to international economic prominence <br/>AND<br/>rising incomes and improving opportunities, is at risk, say some authorities.</p><h4 id="HChineseeconomiccollapsecausesAsianandMiddleEastconflict-Chinawillturnoutwardlyaggressive.-2" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Chinese economic collapse causes Asian and Middle East conflict- China will turn outwardly aggressive.</span></h4><p><strong>Newmeyer 09&nbsp;</strong>DR.

This will not be a replay of the 1930s, but a replay of the 1970s is a serious prospect. The world is in danger of undoing the market reforms of the 1980s and ’90s that brought unprecedented prosperity, especially to emerging markets outside the West. Like the 1970s, policy backsliding could prolong a severe downturn and compromise eventual recovery. The short-term challenge is to arrest the slide to Big Government at home and creeping protectionism abroad. The medium-term challenge is to get back on track with trade and FDI liberalisation combined with domestic structural reforms – substantial "unﬁnished business" left before the crisis struck. More, not less, markets and globalisation are what the world needs. That is primarily a matter for unilateral action by governments and competitive emulation among them. It can be reinforced by international policy cooperation in the WTO, G20 and other fora, but not too much can be expected of cumbersome global-governance mechanisms. Overall, limits to government intervention and a well-functioning market economy are of a piece with open markets, economic globalisation and international political stability.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HScenario2-EconomicCollapse:-3" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Scenario 2- Economic Collapse:</span></h4><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h4 id="HChineseFDItotheUSdeclinedsharplyin2012butcouldreboundiftheUStakesstepstoliberalizeitsnationalsecurityFDIpolicytowardsChina.-2" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Chinese FDI to the US declined sharply in 2012 but could rebound if the US takes steps to liberalize its national security FDI policy towards China.</span></h4><p><strong>Hanemann 12-28</strong> (Theo, research director at the Rhodium Group and leads the firm’s cross-border investment work, Chinese FDI in the US in 2012, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../rhgroup.net/notes/chinese-direct-investmnet-in-the-u-s-in-2012-a-record-year-amid-a-gloomy-fdi-environment)" tppabs="http://rhgroup.net/notes/chinese-direct-investmnet-in-the-u-s-in-2012-a-record-year-amid-a-gloomy-fdi-environment)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://rhgroup.net/notes/chinese-direct-investmnet-in-the-u-s-in-2012-a-record-year-amid-a-gloomy-fdi-environment)</span></a></span><br/>AGAINST THE GLOBAL TREND The recent growth of Chinese investment is even more remarkable in <br/>AND<br/>the United States remains a top destination for FDI from China and elsewhere.</p><h4 id="HAndinvestmentislowoverall2013moreofitiscriticaltojobsandgrowth-1" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>And investment is low overall – more of it is critical to jobs and growth</span></h4><p>Scissors and Payne 1/11/13 (Derek, Senior Research Fellow in Asia Economic Policy, and Dean Cheng is Research Fellow in Chinese Political and Security Affairs, *Amy, research associate at the Heritage Foundation, "Morning Bell: Chinese Investment in the U.S. Shatters Records" <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../blog.heritage.org/2013/01/11/china-investment-in-the-us-2012/-http-/blog.heritage.org/2013/01/11/china-investment-in-the-us-2012/)" tppabs="http://blog.heritage.org/2013/01/11/china-investment-in-the-us-2012/-http://blog.heritage.org/2013/01/11/china-investment-in-the-us-2012/)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://blog.heritage.org/2013/01/11/china-investment-in-the-us-2012/-http://blog.heritage.org/2013/01/11/china-investment-in-the-us-2012/)</span></a></span>&nbsp;</p><p>China set a record with its investments around the world in 2012.

Why the difference? The shale gas boom that is now more than 10 years long in the USA is just getting started in China and so the Chinese remain heavily reliant on coal to make electricity and for their total energy. Around the world, the basic energy choice is coal or gas. China is just the biggest example of this fundamental fact. China's reliance on coal means that its economic growth brings skyrocketing carbon emissions and other air pollution. Indeed, Chinese air quality is infamous around the world, and smog has been so thick that Beijing airport has been unable to land planes for short periods. As of 2011, China was responsible for 29% of the world's carbon emissions, while the US produced 16%, even though the US economy is still considerably bigger than China's. Moreover, US carbon emissions are declining to 1992 levels, but China's emissions skyrocket. Though China is building substantial new wind, solar, and nuclear generation, those investments are not enough to cut Chinese coal consumption, given economic growth that is still 7% in what some describe as an economic slowdown. Shale gas, however, could be big enough to actually displace significant amounts of coal in China. More gas in China means less mercury, soot. lead, smog, and carbon emissions.

This will not be a replay of the 1930s, but a replay of the 1970s is a serious prospect. The world is in danger of undoing the market reforms of the 1980s and ’90s that brought unprecedented prosperity, especially to emerging markets outside the West. Like the 1970s, policy backsliding could prolong a severe downturn and compromise eventual recovery. The short-term challenge is to arrest the slide to Big Government at home and creeping protectionism abroad. The medium-term challenge is to get back on track with trade and FDI liberalisation combined with domestic structural reforms – substantial "unﬁnished business" left before the crisis struck. More, not less, markets and globalisation are what the world needs. That is primarily a matter for unilateral action by governments and competitive emulation among them. It can be reinforced by international policy cooperation in the WTO, G20 and other fora, but not too much can be expected of cumbersome global-governance mechanisms. Overall, limits to government intervention and a well-functioning market economy are of a piece with open markets, economic globalisation and international political stability.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>And Scenario 2 is the economy – <br/>Chinese FDI to the US declined sharply in 2012 but could rebound if the US takes steps to liberalize its national security FDI policy towards China.<br/>Hanemann 12-28 (Theo, research director at the Rhodium Group and leads the firm’s cross-border investment work, Chinese FDI in the US in 2012, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../rhgroup.net/notes/chinese-direct-investmnet-in-the-u-s-in-2012-a-record-year-amid-a-gloomy-fdi-environment)" tppabs="http://rhgroup.net/notes/chinese-direct-investmnet-in-the-u-s-in-2012-a-record-year-amid-a-gloomy-fdi-environment)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://rhgroup.net/notes/chinese-direct-investmnet-in-the-u-s-in-2012-a-record-year-amid-a-gloomy-fdi-environment)</span></a></span><br/>AGAINST THE GLOBAL TREND The recent growth of Chinese investment is even more remarkable in <br/>AND<br/>the United States remains a top destination for FDI from China and elsewhere.<br/>And, energy restrictions destroy investor confidence, which crushes the dollar and triggers economic recession- the vague CFIUS interpretation of national security chills ALL foreign investment.<br/>Carroll-Emory International Law Review-09 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(James, COMMENT: BACK TO THE FUTURE: REDEFINING THE FOREIGN INVESTMENT AND NATIONAL SECURITY ACT’S CONCEPTION OF NATIONAL SECURITY, 23 Emory Int’l L.

Why the difference? The shale gas boom that is now more than 10 years long in the USA is just getting started in China and so the Chinese remain heavily reliant on coal to make electricity and for their total energy. Around the world, the basic energy choice is coal or gas. China is just the biggest example of this fundamental fact. China’s reliance on coal means that its economic growth brings skyrocketing carbon emissions and other air pollution. Indeed, Chinese air quality is infamous around the world, and smog has been so thick that Beijing airport has been unable to land planes for short periods. As of 2011, China was responsible for 29% of the world’s carbon emissions, while the US produced 16%, even though the US economy is still considerably bigger than China’s. Moreover, US carbon emissions are declining to 1992 levels, but China’s emissions skyrocket. Though China is building substantial new wind, solar, and nuclear generation, those investments are not enough to cut Chinese coal consumption, given economic growth that is still 7% in what some describe as an economic slowdown. Shale gas, however, could be big enough to actually displace significant amounts of coal in China. More gas in China means less mercury, soot. lead, smog, and carbon emissions. China’s energy plans call for shale gas to provide 6% of its total energy as soon as 2020. &nbsp;If it achieves that goal, China will avoid more than 500 million tons of carbon pollution per year or about 1.5% of today’s total carbon emissions.</p><p>Increasing demand for Chinese coal production causes water shortages which threaten economic collapse and political instability. <br/>Schneider 11 (Keith, senior editor for Circle of Blue-a nonprofit focusing on resource shortages founded in 2000, Choke Point: China—Confronting Water Scarcity and Energy Demand in the World’s Largest Country, Feb 15, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../www.circleofblue.org/waternews/2011/world/choke-point-china—confronting-water-scarcity-and-energy-demand-in-the-world’s-largest-country/)" tppabs="http://www.circleofblue.org/waternews/2011/world/choke-point-china%E2%80%94confronting-water-scarcity-and-energy-demand-in-the-world%E2%80%99s-largest-country/)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.circleofblue.org/waternews/2011/world/choke-point-china%E2%80%94confronting-water-scarcity-and-energy-demand-in-the-world%E2%80%99s-largest-country/)</span></a></span><br/>By any measure, conventional and otherwise, China’s tireless advance to international economic prominence <br/>AND<br/>rising incomes and improving opportunities, is at risk, say some authorities.<br/>And, pollution from coal causes environmental protests that threaten CCP rule. <br/>LeVine 12 (Steve, author of The Oil and the Glory, Foreign Policy contributor, &nbsp;CHINA The Cost of Coal , The Weekly Wrap — Aug. 3, 2012, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../oilandglory.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/08/03/the_weekly_wrap_aug_3_2012_part_i-http-/oilandglory.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/08/03/the_weekly_wrap_aug_3_2012_part_i)" tppabs="http://oilandglory.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/08/03/the_weekly_wrap_aug_3_2012_part_i-http://oilandglory.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/08/03/the_weekly_wrap_aug_3_2012_part_i)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://oilandglory.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/08/03/the_weekly_wrap_aug_3_2012_part_i-http://oilandglory.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/08/03/the_weekly_wrap_aug_3_2012_part_i)</span></a></span></p><p>China’s moment of coal truth: A question that has vexed us for some time <br/>AND<br/>and economic outcomes.
