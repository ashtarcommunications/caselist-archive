The implication of this message is equally clear.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">Given the</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;structural&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">setting of a</span> complex <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">policymaking process that is</span> woven throughout government and is <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">directly affected</span> by the tensions created <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">by separation of powers</span> and federalism<span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">no comprehensive</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;national&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">energy policy</span> of any detail <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">is likely to develop</span> despite executive, legislative, or administrative desires to do so<span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">There are ideological and pragmatic reasons</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;behind this conclusion. The&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">first</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;reason, grounded in the liberal tradition,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">is that the country is "generally suspicious" of central planning</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">. Rather than have an imitation Japanese or European industrial policy, the United States economy continues to run on private competition. Granted, the government will attempt to halt large accumulations of corporate power through antitrust enforcement. Still, though, countervailing government control of the economy through heavy central planning is simply not an accepted way of doing business.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">A&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">second</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;and corollary reason is that although government is used as a backstop to prevent large aggregations of corporate power,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">government</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">will</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;also&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">promote and support competitive businesses</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">. The New Deal was not so much an experiment in social policythough it was clearly that-as it was an example of the federal government stimulating the economy by getting business on its feet again.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Third, there is a commitment to&nbsp;</span>the hard energy path of<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;largescale, high-tech</span>nology, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">capital intensive energy production.</span> This commitment finds its roots in the industrial revolution <span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">of the nineteenth century. This history makes it difficult for policy makers and decision makers to design and implement alternative energy policies, thus putting the burden of change on proponents 'of alternatives.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Fourth</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, also echoing the liberal tradition,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">there is an underlying faith in the market</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">. The country's efforts to achieve the virtues of the market-color blindness, individual liberty, eqmility, and technological innovations-may not reach a Utopian plateau, but government controls are worse approximations. The country's faith in the market forms the baseline, and government will only intervene if cracks in the baseline are perceived.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Thus the dominant model of U.S. energy policy is firmly based in the tenets of democratic capitalism: private ownership and production; competition; no overt central planning; wariness of monopoly; and government support of each of the other elements. The hope is that our national economy and our quality of life can flourish if (1) markets are relatively clear, (2) entry and exits are relatively inexpensive, and (3) corporate power is relatively dispersed.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Indeed, the ideology of domestic energy policy rests upon the idea that inter-industry and intra-industry competition are highly desirable</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">~' Moreover, such industrial pluralism ultimately serves the public interest by providing relatively abundant energy at relatively stable prices. Economic efficiency, economic growth, economies of scale, and a cautious eye on market power thus define the public interest in energy. So says the dominant model. What remains to be seen is whether the dominant model has significant longevity given contemporary concerns about the continued use of fossil fuels and environmental degradation.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">Before</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;the environmental consequences of hard path&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">energy production can be adequately addressed</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">, however,&nbsp;</span><em><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">the</span></em><em><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;dominant&nbsp;</span></em><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11pt; background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow">structure of</span></em><em><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;domestic&nbsp;</span></em><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11pt; background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow">energy policymaking</span></em><em><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;and policy&nbsp;</span></em><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11pt; background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow">must be acknowledged</span></em><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">.

These processes, their forms of reason and discourse, can be said to have performed a particular imagination of their public, and encouraged the material enactment of that imagination into society. If we also refer back here to the practices of pollution management at the Windscale-Sellafield site, as reflected in Dunster's 1958 description earlier of how routine marine radioactive discharges were set, we can see in this account, and in the ensuing environmental contamination and human exposures from this, a performance of nuclear technology's imagined publics. We can see from not only the typical symbolism but also in corresponding material practices that as democratic participants, worthy of respectful recognition and to be given standing as part of the moral --community in which nuclear technology exists, effectively there is no public. It has been one of the most significant shifts of collective understanding amongst many - contributed by the late twentieth century social sciences and humanities, that symbolic actions carry corresponding changes in material social relations. Thus the&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">normatively imposed social relations of technoscience here are not just symbolically projected, but also materially performed</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">. In addition to the instances noted above, a further routinized example of the latter was the sustained extreme secrecy and misinformation that was practised by the UK nuclear authorities behind the scenes of this 1956 flood of positive publicity, and in imposed assumptions-in-practice about what people's concerns, needs and capacities are and should be. These were in no need of co ll ective negotiation; they were subsumed into the dominant assumed ontology. Inquiry inspector Mr Justice Parker's later empiricist framing and interpretation of the Windscale inquiry's conflicting ontological commitments, as these were embodied in the irreconcilable arguments of the parties but represented by him as measurable - and measured by him - against an empirically discoverable standard, did the same. Despite all the noise and fury of public debate and controversy, his discrete translations of expressed public concerns into his own terms were not subjected to any direct accountable scrutiny. Of course, his rational arguments in favour of THORP's approval were, but that is not what I am referring to here. This book still stands as a sole, modest and utterly marginal witness to this.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><h4 id="HTechnocraticmanagementmakesextinctioninevitable2014noaffproposalcansolve." class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Technocratic management makes extinction inevitable—no aff proposal can solve.</span></h4><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">Crist 7</span> Eileen Crist, Associate Professor of Science and Technology in Society at Virginia Tech University, 2007, “Beyond the Climate Crisis: A Critique of Climate Change Discourse,” <em>Telos</em>, Volume 141, Winter, Available Online to Subscribing Institutions via Telos Press, p. 49-51</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">If mainstream environmentalism is catching up with the solution promoted by Teller, and perhaps harbored all along by the Bush administration, it would certainly be ironic.

Initial interest in renewable energy by the sustainability camp no doubt emanated, at least in part, from the fact that its fuel price is non-existent and that capitalization of systems to collect renewable sources need not involve the extravagant, convoluted corporate forms that manage the conventional energy regime. But forgotten, or misunderstood, in the attraction of renewable energy have been the social origins of such emergent possibilities. Communities exist today who address energy needs outside the global marketplace: they are often rural in character and organize energy services that are immune to oil price spikes and do not require water heated to between 550Q and 900Q Fahrenheit (300Q and 500Q Celsius) (the typical temperatures in nuclear reactors). No energy bills are sent or paid and governance of the serving infrastructure is based on local (rather than distantly developed professional) knowledge. Needless to say,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">sustainability is embodied in the lifeworld of</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;these&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">communities</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, u</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">nlike&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">the modern strategy</span> that <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">hopes to design sustainability into its technology</span> and economics <span style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">so as not to</span> seriously <span style="background: yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">change its</span> otherwise <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">unsustainable</span> way of <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">life</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;. Predictably,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">modern society will underscore its wealth and technical acumen as evidence of its superiority over alternatives</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">. But smugness cannot overcome the fact that&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">energy-society relations are evident in which the bribe of democratic-authoritarianism and the unsustainability of energy capitalism are successfully declined.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">In L 928, Mahatma Gandhi (cited in Gandhi, 1965: 52) explained why the democratic-authoritarian bargain and Western capitalism should be rejected: God forbid that India should ever take to industrialization after the manner of the West. The economic imperialism of a single tiny island kingdom (England) is today keeping the world in chains. If an entire nation of 300 million took to similar economic exploitation, it would strip the world bare like locusts. Unless the capitalists of India help to avert that tragedy by becoming trustees of the welfare of the masses and by devoting their talents not to amassing wealth for themselves but to the service of the masses in an altruistic spirit, they will end either by destroying the masses or being destroyed by them. As Gandhi's remark reveals,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">social inequality resides not in access to electric light</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;and other accoutrements of modernity,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">but in a world order that places efficiency and wealth above life-affirming ways of life</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">This is our social problem, our&nbsp;</span><em><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">energy problem</span></em><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">our ecological problem</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, and, generally, our political-economic problem.

The US Department of Commerce estimates the world market for nuclear power technology, fuel and related services and equipment at "upwards of" $750 billion over the next 10 years, Richard Myers, vice president for policy development, planning and supplier programs at NEI, said at a press conference Monday in Washington to release a report the US nuclear power industry commissioned on the topic. "</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">It is a myth that the US nuclear supply chain has disappeared</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">," Myers said</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Most manufacturing of large "heavy metal" components for nuclear power plants, such as reactor vessels, is now done in Asia, but many US firms manufacture "precision components" for the nuclear industry and would stand to benefit from increased ability to compete with other countries</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 9.0pt">, Myers said.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">US licensing and regulatory reviews of</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;nuclear&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">exports</span>, however, <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">are</span> "unduly <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">burdensome</span>," <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">have</span> confusing "<span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">layers of jurisdiction" shared by</span> at least <span style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">four</span> federal <span style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">agencies, and</span> typically <span style="background: yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">take</span> at least <span style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">a year to complete, "months longer" than</span> reviews <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">in other</span> exporter <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">countries</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">, he said.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">As a result,&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">the US export control regime is</span> "far more complex and <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">more difficult to navigate</span> ... than comparable regimes in other nations<span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">," Myers said. The report prepared by the law firm Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman for NEI said that "US agencies should be able to increase the efficiency of their license processing through stronger executive branch procedures. By signaling to potential customers that US exports may be licensed on a schedule comparable to those of foreign export control regimes, such an improvement could significantly 'level the playing field' for US exporters in the near term." Many such reforms can be accomplished "administratively," without the need for legislation, James Glasgow, a partner at Pillsbury who specializes in nuclear export law, said during the press conference. The US Department of Energy is currently amending some of its export regulations, known as the Part 810 rule, and reforming that rule could provide significant opportunities to US exporters, Glasgow said. Unfortunately, some of DOE's proposed revisions to the rule go in the wrong direction, adding regulatory requirements and hurdles, Myers said.

It should be noted that, of the crises that involved four nuclear actors—Suez Nationalization War (1956), Berlin Wall (1961), October Yom Kippur War (1973), and Iraq No-Fly Zone (1992)—and five nuclear actors—Gulf War (1990)—only two are not full-scale wars. While this demonstrates that the pacifying effect of more nuclear actors is not strong enough to prevent war in all situations, it does not necessarily weaken the argument that there is actually a pacifying effect. The positive and statistically significant coefficient on the variable that counts the number of crisis actors has a magnitude greater than that on the variable that counts the number of nuclear actors. Since increases in the number of overall actors in a crisis are strongly associated with higher levels of violence, it should be no surprise that many of the conflicts with many nuclear actors—by extension, many general actors as well—experienced war. Therefore, the results can only suggest that,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">keeping the number of crisis actors fixed, increasing the proportion of nuclear actors has a pacifying effect</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">. They do not suggest that adding nuclear actors to a crisis will decrease the risk of high levels violence; but rather, adding more actors of any type to a crisis can have a destabilizing effect. Also in Table IV,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Model 2 demonstrates that the effect of a nuclear dyad is only approaching statistical significance</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">, but does have a sign that indicates higher levels of violence are less likely in crises with opponents that have nuclear weapons than other crises.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">This</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;lukewarm result&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">suggests that it might not be necessary for nuclear actors to face each other in order to get the effect of decreased propensity for violence.</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">All actors</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;should&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">tend to be more cautious</span> in escalation <span style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">when there is a nuclear opponent</span>, regardless of their own capabilities<span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">. While this might weaken support for focusing on specifically a ‘balance of terror’ as a source of stability (see Gaddis, 1986; Waltz, 1990; Sagan and Waltz, 2003; Mearsheimer, 1990),&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">it supports the logic in this article that&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">nuclear weapons</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;can serve as a&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">deter</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">rent of&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">aggression</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;from both nuclear and non-nuclear opponents</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">.6 Model 3 transforms the violence variable to a binary indicator of war and demonstrates that the principal relationship between the number of nuclear actors and violence holds for the most crucial outcome of full-scale war.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Model 4 demonstrates that accounting for the presence of new nuclear actors does not greatly change the results.</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">The coefficient on the new nuclear actor variable is</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;statistically&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">insignificant, which lends credence to the</span> optimists’ <span style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">view that new nuclear</span>-weapon <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">states should not</span> be presupposed to <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">behave less responsibly</span> than the USA, USSR, UK, France, and China did during the Cold War<span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">. Finally, Model 5 similarly illustrates that crises involving superpowers are not more or less prone to violence than others. Superpower activity appears to not be driving the observed relationships between the number of nuclear-crisis actors and restraint toward violence. It is important to establish more specifically what the change in the probability of full-scale war is when nuclear actors are involved. Table V presents the probability of different levels of violence as the number of nuclear actors increases in the Clarify simulations. The control variables are held at their modes or means, with the exception of the variable that counts the number of crisis actors. Because it would be impossible to have, say, five nuclear-crisis actors and only two crisis actors, the number of crisis actors is held constant at five. As we can see,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the impact of an increase in the number of nuclear actors is substantial.&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">Starting from a crisis</span> situation <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">without any nuclear actors, including one</span> nuclear actor (out of five) <span style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">reduces the likelihood of</span> fullscale <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">war by nine percentage points</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow">.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">As we</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;continue to&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">add nuclear actors, the likelihood of</span> full-scale <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">war declines sharply</span>, so that the probability of a war with the maximum number of nuclear actors is about three times less than the probability with no nuclear actors<span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">.

While we control for the strategic selection of serious threats within crises, we are unable to control for the non-random initial initiation of a crisis in which the actors may choose to enter a crisis based on some ex ante assessment of the outcomes.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">To account for possible selection bias caused by the use of a truncated sample that does not include any non-crisis cases,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">one would need to use another dataset in which the crisis cases are a subset and then run Heckman type selection models (see Lemke and Reed, 2001). It would, however, be difficult to think of a different unit of analysis that might be employed, such that the set of crises is a subset of a larger category of interaction. While dyadyear datasets have often been employed to similar ends, the key independent variable here, which is specific to crises as the unit of analysis, does not lend itself to a dyadic setup. Moreover, selection bias concerns are likely not valid in disputing the claims of this analysis</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">. If selection bias were present, it would tend to bias the effect of nuclear weapons downward, because the set of observed crises with nuclear actors likely has a disproportionate share of resolved actors that have chosen to take their chances against a nuclear opponent. Despite this potential mitigating bias, the results are statistically significant, which strengthens the case for the explanations provided in this study</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><h4 id="HDeterrencefailureisveryunlikely.Proliferationsavesmorelivesthanitcosts." class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Deterrence failure is very unlikely.

This will happen in two main ways.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">First,&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow">only a small number of people need be involved in</span> Third World <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">c</span>ommand <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">and c</span>ontrol<span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">. The superpowers had tens of thousands of nuclear warheads and thousands of nuclear weapons personnel in a variety of deployments organized around numerous nuclear delivery platforms. A state that has, say, fifty nuclear weapons needs at most fifty launch operators and only a handful of group commanders. This has both quantitative and qualitative repercussions.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Quantitatively,&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">the</span> very <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">small number of people</span> 'in the loop' greatly <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">diminishes the</span> statistical <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">probability that accidents</span> or human error <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow">will result</span> in inappropriate nuclear launches<span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">. All else being equal, the chances of finding some guard asleep at some post increases with the number of guards and posts one has to cover.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Qualitatively,&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">small numbers makes it possible to</span> centrally <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">train operators</span>, to screen <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">and choose them with exceeding care</span>, 7 <span style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">and to keep each of them in direct contact</span> with central authorities <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">in</span> times of <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">crises</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow">.</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;With very small control communities, there is no need for intermediary commanders. Important information and instructions can get out quickly and directly. Quality control of launch operators and operations is easier. In some part, at least, Third World states can compensate for their lack of sophisticated use-control technology with a more controlled selection of, and more extensive communication with, human operators.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Secondly, and relatedly, Third World&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">proliferators will not need</span> to rely on cumbersome <span style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">standard operating procedures</span> to manage and launch their nuclear weapons<span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">. This is because the number of weapons will be so small, and also because the arsenals will be very simple in composition.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">Third World stares</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;simply&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">will not have that many weapons to keep track of</span>.<span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;Third World states will not have the great variety of delivery platforms that the superpowers had (various ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, long range bombers, fighter bombers, missile submarines, nuclear armed ships, nuclear mortars, etc., etc.), or the great number and variety of basing options, and they will not employ the complicated strategies of international basing that the superpowers used. The small and simple arsenals of Third World proliferators will not require highly complex systems to coordinate nuclear activities.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">This</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow">&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">creates</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;two specific&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">organizational advantages</span>. One, <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">small organizations</span>, even if they do rely to some extent of standard operating procedures, <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">can be flexible in times of crisis</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">. As we have discussed, the essential problem of standard operating procedures in nuclear launch processes is that the full range if possible strategic developments cannot be predicted and specified before the fact, and thus responses to them cannot be standardized fully. An unexpected event can lead to 'mismatched' and inappropriate organizational reactions. In complex and extensive command and control organizations, standard operating procedures coordinate great numbers of people at numerous levels of command structure in a great multiplicity of places. If an unexpected event triggers operating procedures leading to what would be an inappropriate nuclear launch, it would be very difficult for central commanders to “get the word out' to everyone involved. The coordination needed to stop launch activity would be at least as complicated as the coordination needed to initiate it, and, depending on the speed of launch processes, there may be less time to accomplish it. However,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">the small numbers of people</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;involved in nuclear launches and the simplicity of arsenals&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">will make it</span> far <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">easier</span> for Third World leaders <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">to</span> 'get the word out' and <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">reverse launch procedures</span> if necessary<span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">. Again, so few will be the numbers of weapons that all launch operators could be contacted directly by central leaders. The programmed triggers of standard operating procedures can be passed over in favor of unscripted, flexible responses based on a limited number of human-to-human communications and confirmations.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Two,&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">the smallness</span> and simplicity of Third World command and control organizations <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">will make it easier</span> for leaders <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">to</span> keep <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">track</span> of <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">everything that is going on</span> at any given moment. One of the great dangers of complex organizational procedures is that once one organizational event is triggered<span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">—once an alarm is sounded and a programmed response is made—</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">other branches of the organization are likely to be affected as well</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">. This is what Charles Perrow refers to as interactive complexity, 8 and it has been a mainstay in organizational critiques of nuclear command and control s ystems.9 The more complex the organization is, the more likely these secondary effects are, and the less likely they are to be foreseen, noticed, and well-managed. So, for instance, an American commander that gives the order to scramble nuclear bombers over the U.S. as a defensive measure may find that he has unwittingly given the order to scramble bombers in Europe as well. A recall order to the American bombers may overlook the European theater, and nuclear misuse could result.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">However, when numbers of nuclear weapons can be measured in the dozens</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;rather than the hundreds or thousands, and when deployment of those weapons does not involve multiple theaters and forward based delivery vehicles of numerous types,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">tight coupling is unlikely to cause unforeseen and unnoticeable organizational events</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">. Other things being equal, it is just a lot easier to know all of what is going on. In short, while Third World states may nor have the electronic use-control devices that help ensure that peripheral commanders do nor 'get out of control,' they have other advantages that make the challenge of centralized control easier than it was for the superpowers.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The small numbers of personnel and organizational simplicity of launch bureaucracies means that even if a few more people have their fingers on the button than in the case of the superpowers,&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">there will be less of a chance that weapons will be launched without a definite</span>, informed and unambiguous <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">decision</span> to press that button<span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">.</span></p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h3 id="H2NC2014NoProlif" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>2NC—No Prolif</span></h3><h4 id="HNowidespreadprolif2014" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>No widespread prolif—</span></h4><p class="MsoNormal">Proliferating states have <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">dysfunctional management</span> of nuclear programs due to <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">weak political institutions</span>. &nbsp;The quality of technical workmanship is low; there is no coordination among technical teams, and mistakes cause finger pointing and delays—that’s Hymans.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><h4 id="HPreferourevidence2014" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Prefer our evidence—</span></h4><p class="MsoNormal">First—it takes into account globalization which has spread nuclear know-how and tech. &nbsp;Prolif has <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">still slowed</span> proving the problems listed above can’t be fixed.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">Second—people have been predicting a prolif breakout for 50 years and it has never manifested—prefer empirics which are objective and untainted by ideology.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><h4 id="HProlifisslowandstable2014theirevishysteria." class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Prolif is slow and stable—their ev is hysteria.</span></h4><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">Mueller 9</span>—John Mueller is a professor of political science and Woody Hayes Chair of National Security Studies at the Mershon Center at Ohio State University October 23, 2009, “The Rise of Nuclear Alarmism,” <em>Foreign Policy</em>, http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2009/10/23/the_rise_of_nuclear_alarmism?page=full</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">We</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;have</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;also&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">endured decades of hysteria over</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;the potential for&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">nuclear&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow">prolif</span>eration, <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow">even though</span> the <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow">prolif</span>eration that <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow">has</span> actually taken place has <span style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">been</span> both <span style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">modest and</span> substantially <span style="background: yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">inconsequential</span>.<span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">When</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;the quintessential rogue state, communist&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">China, obtained them in 1964, CIA Director</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;John McCone sternly&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">proclaimed that nuclear war was "almost inevitable."

If the expected costs from nuclear wars arising out of miscalculation or irrational acts exceed the expected costs from wars that could be prevented by proliferation, then,</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;indeed,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">proliferation is a very dangerous</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;thing. There is, of course, no precise way to measure these expected costs, but we do have some basis for estimating them. Using expected utility calculations similar to the one suggested here, one of us (Bueno de Mesquita 1981b) found that 65 of approximately 70,000 opportunities to initiate war rationally were seized in the period 1816 to 1974, with hundreds of other opportunities being used to threaten war. In that same study it was also found that only 11 of nearly 500,000 opportunities to initiate war were seized in violation of the expectations arising from the expected utility framework. In other words,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">the ratio of</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;seemingly&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">rational</span> and correct <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">calculations to</span> either <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">irrational calculations or miscalculations that have led to war is over 40 to 1</span>. This implies that <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">through</span> symmetry-producing <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">nuclear prolif</span>eration, <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">we may expect to prevent</span> approximately <span style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">40 conventional or</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;one-sided&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">nuclear wars for every one miscalculated</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;or irrational bilateral&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">nuclear exchange</span>. Using the 40 most recent wars as a crude indicator, this analysis implies that <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">a single</span> miscalculated or irrational <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">nuclear exchange</span> in the third world <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow">would have to kill</span> several <span style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">tens of millions of people before</span> some <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">proliferation would be unjustified by yielding a higher expected loss of life</span>. It seems to us unlikely that one such miscalculated or irrational act among third world countries, each with a very few warheads, could produce this level of loss<span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">. Still, we do not rule it out, but rather note that it is exactly such estimates that must be made in calculating the trade-offs between gains and losses from nuclear proliferation. One might expect, for instance, that selection of candidates for proliferation might be based partially on the calculation of the marginal effect on expected costs in life and property from not standing in the way of the candidate in question. Thus, proliferation would be resisted where the expected marginal effect would be an increase in loss of life and property over nonproliferation, but would be encouraged where the marginal effect was otherwise.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><h4 id="HSameeffectasnuclearwar" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Same effect as nuclear war</span></h4><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">Jianguo 95</span>—Major General, frmr assoc. prof and Dean of the Antichemical Warfare Academy Wu, Nuclear Shadows on High-Tech Warfare, http://www.fas.org/nuke/guide/china/doctrine/jianguo.htm</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">What merits our attention is that&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">in a high-tech conventional war, a nuclear environment may</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;still&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">emerge even if nuclear weapons are not used</span>.<span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;The more society advances, the greater the demands for energy will be.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">In order to satisfy the demands for energy, nuclear power stations were built.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">According to the data released by the International Atomic Energy Agency in March 1994, at the end of 1993 there were 430 nuclear power plants with a total installed capacity of approximately 345 million kw operating in various places throughout the world; these accounted for more than 17 percent of the world's gross power generation.

Coupled with the peculiar nature of the DPRK's autocratic regime, a nuclear-armed DPRK is then perceived as too hostile and destructive to its neighbours. However, applying the analogy of “more may be better”, an alternative discourse with respect to nuclear proliferation maintained by Waltz could well pinpoint a far more optimistic scenario. Contrary to conventional wisdom, Waltz asserts that nuclear&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">prolif</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">eration&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">not only reduces the possibility of going to war, but also encourages</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;new nuclear&nbsp;</span><span style="background: yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">states</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">,</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;which used to rule in a radical manner domestically,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">to behave in an increasingly rational manner</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;diplomatically. At the extreme, Waltz suggests that nuclear&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">prolif</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">eration&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">may maintain peace</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;rather than threaten global security</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">. Surprisingly, the application of his theory to the DPRK is rather limited; and is confined only to media reports (Swami, 2010). In his classic study Waltz (1995) proposes five fundamental assumptions to illustrate his argument. First, he argues that the international system is anarchical, i.e., no global authority protects security, provides public goods or controls domestic affairs above the state level. As a result, states have to ensure their own security by preventing attack from other states themselves. In other words, the anarchical system drives states to self-help. The absence of a world government then prompts individual states to gain access to weapons to compensate for a sense of insecurity. Acquisition of nuclear weapons and inducement of an arms race between states show the self-help system at work. Second, as “states coexist in a condition of anarchy”, they try hard to advance the sophistication of weapons and enhance military capability as much as possible to avoid aggression from adversaries (Waltz, 1995, p. 4). This self-strengthening process is what Waltz calls “security maximization”. What do states do with their weapons throughout this process? Waltz thinks that&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">states</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;mainly&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">possess</span> the <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">weapons for a defensive purpose</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">. When a state enhances its military capability (the relevant gain), its neighbouring states immediately face relevant loss to the military equilibrium. In consequence, the latter have to strengthen their military power in response to the relevant loss in order to maintain a balance of power. Waltz (1995, p. 5) explains the defensive intention of security maximization as follows: One way to counter an intended attack is to build fortifications and to muster forces that look forbiddingly strong. To build defenses so patently strong that no one will try to destroy or overcome them would make international life perfectly tranquil, I call this the defensive ideal. However, this statement does not imply that these states will not use weapons to attack others. In the event that a state perceives gains from aggression to outweigh the cost of war, battle might break out. Waltz argues that this scenario is unlikely to happen between nuclear powers. Since Waltz, different schools deriving from neo-realism have offered different assumptions on the likeliness of conflicts owing to different assessments of uncertainty and risk, such as offensive realism or defensive realism. Some might put the defensive rationale by indicating that states tend to keep the nuclear weapons as an “existential deterrent” so as to deter others from military actions (Naval Studies Board and US Research Council, 1997). Third, Waltz (1995, pp. 7, 9) maintains that&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">nuclear weapons</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, unlike conventional weapons,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">give “an easy clarity” for states to predict the action of other states and</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;thereby&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow">“makes war less likely</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">”. This is because all states realize that nuclear weapons have the potential to cause unlimited and devastating suffering. At the extreme, the concept of mutual assured destruction (MAD) sends a very clear message to both sides should two nuclear powers go to war. In contrast, as the suffering from conventional weapons can be to some extent contained, states might deem the cost of such war affordable and recklessly wage war and suffer the results of miscalculation. Waltz (1995, p. 9) defines the fundamental essence of nuclear weapons thus:&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">In a nuclear world, prediction is easy to make because it does not require close estimates of opposing forces</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">. … In a conventional world, deterrent threats are ineffective because the damage threatened is distant, limited, and problematic. Fourth, Waltz (1995, p. 7) assumes state actors are rational and are able to predict scenarios as well as calculate their self-interests, so that states will not take the risk of going to war when they predict the battle could only “win much and might lose everything”. Waltz offers the case of the Cuban Missile Crisis to illustrate this point. As nuclear weapons can wreak unlimited damage to states, the strategy of MAD further makes states cautious. This&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">deterrent effect</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;in a nuclear world consequently&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">avoids any miscalculation of gains and losses</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">. Regardless of the regime type, historical context and the political spectrum, nuclear weapons and&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">nuclear wars&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">constantly&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">imply a massive</span> relevant <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">loss to states</span>, thus <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">preventing them from going to war</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">. Even if the historical context might determine a nuclear pair, such as the US and the Soviet Union, China and the Soviet Union, India and Pakistan, many realists argues that rational calculation is more fundamental than bitterness (Rajain, 2005). As Waltz (1995, p. 12) puts it: “Those who believe that bitterness causes wars assume a close association that is seldom found between bitterness among nations and their willingness to run high risks.” In short, states will not go to nuclear war as they are rational actors in international relations. Fifth, when calculation of the prospects makes nuclear states reluctant to go to war, Waltz suggests horizontal nuclear proliferation is encouraged in world politics while vertical proliferation is made redundant. “Vertical proliferation” of nuclear weapons, according to Waltz, was demonstrated during the Cold War, especially between the US and the Soviet Union, when the number of nuclear warheads and their technological quality rapidly increased. Waltz (1995, p. 7) argues that further vertical proliferation is unnecessary since only a few nuclear weapons and a “second strike” capability may be a sufficient deterrent to other would-be attackers. Rather, “horizontal proliferation”, which means the spread of nuclear weapons to different countries, is seen by Waltz as more crucial in preserving peace in the world.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">When more states possess nuclear weapons,&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">calculations about using them become complicated</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;(Waltz, 1995, p. 15).&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">States will</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;thus&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">be reluctant to take the risk of starting a nuclear war because of the uncertainty of the response</span> from other states<span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;and the certainty of unlimited nuclear destruction to both sides should a nuclear response be elicited. This helps exclude the option of using nuclear weapons for the mere purpose of interest maximization.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><h4 id="HDeterrencebreakdownsdon2019tcausefull-scalenuclearwar" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Deterrence breakdowns don’t cause full-scale nuclear war</span></h4><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:.2in"><span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">Waltz 3</span> Kenneth, Emeritus Professor of Political Science at UC Berkeley and Adjunct Senior Research Scholar at Columbia University, The Spread of Nuclear Weapons: A Debate Renewed, p. 34-35</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:.2in">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">States are deterred by the prospect of</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;suffering&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">severe damage</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;and by their inability to do much to limit it. Deterrence works because nuclear weapons enable one state to punish another state severely without first defeating it. "Victory," in Thomas Schelling's words, "is no longer a prerequisite for hurting the enemy." 37 Countries armed only with conventional weapons can hope that their military forces will be able to limit the damage an attacker can do. Among countries armed with strategic nuclear forces, the hope of avoiding heavy damage depends mainly on the attacker's restraint and little on one's own efforts. Those who compared expected deaths through strategic exchanges of nuclear warheads with casualties suffered by the Soviet Union in World War II overlooked the fundamental difference between conventional and nuclear worlds. 38</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Deterrence rests on what countries can do to each other with strategic nuclear weapons.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">From this statement,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">one can&nbsp;</span><em><span style="font-size:12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">easily leap to the wrong conclusion</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">: that deterrent strategies, if they have to be carried through, will produce a catastrophe.&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">That countries are able to annihilate each other means neither that deterrence depends on their threatening to do so nor that they</span> <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">will</span> necessarily do so <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">if deterrence fails</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">.

The United States had the ability to place thousands of warheads precisely on targets in the Soviet Union. Surely we would have struck military targets before striking industrial targets and industrial targets before striking cities.

As ever, the biggest international dangers come from the strongest states.

Firstly, it clearly relates to how receptive policy makers will be to threats made by opponents. For example, De Rivera (1968, 53) suggests that the signal-to-noise ratio (the strength of the signal relative to the strength of confusing background stimuli), the rewards and costs associated with recognizing (or not) the signals, and the general expectations of the observer play a role in whether initiator or defender threats are heard by the other. Secondly, for sensitive leaders (those high in complexity), they are highly unlikely to make rapid, impulsive decisions in even a conventional crisis, let alone a nuclear one. Such leaders are known for having extremely slow, deliberative, and cautious decision processes that seek out tremendous amounts of information for consideration prior to making decisions (Preston 2001). As a result, such&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background: yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">policy makers would be exceedingly unlikely to "rush to judgment" and misperceive the relatively simple cost/loss equation created by nuclear weapons</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">.</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">They also would be highly attentive to signaling from potential adversaries in such a nuclear deterrence environment</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">. In contrast, for insensitive leaders (those low in complexity), they would be far more likely to "rush to judgment," miss warning signals from potential adversaries, and pay little attention to information or feedback from the external environment. Such leaders would be far more vulnerable to the psychological malfunctions of selective perception, use of stereotypes and faulty analogies, and groupthinktype malfunctions (see Janis 1972; Janis and Mann 1977; 't Hart 1994; 't Hart, Stern, and Sundelius 1997). Hence, the risk of miscalculation or challenges to deterrence from such leaders would undoubtedly be greater than would be the case for sensitive leaders. At the same time, the fact that such leaders also view the world in simple, black-and-white terms and do not necessarily tune into nuances suggests they would be far more likely to accept the quite simplistic, black-and-white cost/loss benefit equation nuclear weapons thrust upon security relationships. Historically,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">American presidents scoring both high and low in complexity</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, sensitive</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;ones like Eisenhower and Kennedy,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">as well as less sensitive</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;ones such as Truman, Johnson, and Reagan,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">have all</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;(despite their rhetoric)&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">shown great caution when making</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;foreign policy&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">decisions that could</span> in any way <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">provoke a true nuclear response</span> from an opponent<span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">. Indeed, Truman and Johnson (in Korea and Vietnam respectively) both recognized the serious constraints which the Soviet possession of nuclear weapons posed on the unlimited exercise of American power in both conflicts (see Preston 2001).&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The reactions of policy makers under the immense stress of nuclear crises has</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;also&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">been pointed to by deterrence skeptics</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">as likely leading to</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;greater chances for&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">decisional pathologies</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;(e.g.,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">misperception</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, motivated misperceptions, avoidance of value trade-offs,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">groupthink</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">) to impact decision making and lead to deterrence failure (Janis 1972; Janis and Mann 1977; Jervis 1976; Lebow 1981, 1987; Lebow and Stein 1989, 1990).

Similarly, George (1991) de scribes the Cuban Missile Crisis as an example of excellent crisis management (see also Preston 2001). And Blight (1992) notes that for policy makers, the fear of nuclear war (a "shattered crystal ball") served as an "adaptive device" preventing JFK and the ExComm from taking reckless actions and seeking every possible means to avoid a nuclear exchange. Nevertheless, a substantial literature in political psychology (Janis and Mann 1977; Hermann 1979; Hermann and Hermann 1990; "t Hart 1994) warns that policy makers reactions and decision making patterns under intense stress deteriorate and become less effective as the levels increase—an element that can never be fully removed from considerations of the resilience of nuclear deterrence under severe crises conditions.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><h3 id="H2NCProximity" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span><span id="_Toc240796006"></span>2NC Proximity</span></h3><h4 id="H1.Proximityhasnoneteffect2014statesneareachotheraremorelikelytofightconventionalwarsoverborders2Cresources2Corethnicgroups.MakesdeterrenceMOREnecessary.Plusproliferatorsacknowledgenukesarepurelydefensive2014that2019sShen" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>1.

Three explanations for its demise stand out. The first is historical. States develop; they get better at generating and piecing together the human, financial, and technological resources that lead to productivity and prosperity. The same holds for corporations and other organizations. The rise of these new powers cannot be stopped. The result is an ever larger number of actors able to exert influence regionally or globally. A second cause is U.S. policy. To paraphrase Walt Kelly's Pogo, the post-World War II comic hero, we have met the explanation and it is us.

Since the first oil shocks of the 1970s, U.S. consumption of oil has grown by approximately 20 percent, and, more important, U.S. imports of petroleum products have more than doubled in volume and nearly doubled as a percentage of consumption. This growth in demand for foreign oil has helped drive up the world price of oil from just over $20 a barrel to over $100 a barrel in less than a decade. The result is an enormous transfer of wealth and leverage to those states with energy reserves. In short, U.S. energy policy has helped bring about the emergence of oil and gas producers as major power centers. U.S. economic policy has played a role as well. President Lyndon Johnson was widely criticized for simultaneously fighting a war in Vietnam and increasing domestic spending. President Bush has fought costly wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, allowed discretionary spending to increase by an annual rate of eight percent, and cut taxes. As a result, the United States' fiscal position declined from a surplus of over $100 billion in 2001 to an estimated deficit of approximately $250 billion in 2007. Perhaps more relevant is&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">the ballooning</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;current&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">account deficit</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, which is now more than six percent of GDP. This places downward pressure on the dollar, stimulates inflation, and&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">contributes to the accumulation of wealth and power elsewhere</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;in the world</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">. Poor regulation of the U.S. mortgage market and the credit crisis it has spawned have exacerbated these problems. The war in Iraq has also contributed to the dilution of the United States' position in the world.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">The war in Iraq has proved</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;to be an expensive war of choice -- militarily, economically, and diplomatically as well as in human terms. Years ago, the historian Paul Kennedy outlined his thesis about "</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">imperial overstretch</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">," which posited that the United States would eventually decline by overreaching, just as other great powers had in the past. Kennedy's theory turned out to apply most immediately to the Soviet Union, but the United States -- for all its corrective mechanisms and dynamism -- has not proved to be immune. It is not simply that the U.S. military will take a generation to recover from Iraq; it is also that the United States lacks sufficient military assets to continue doing what it is doing in Iraq, much less assume new burdens of any scale elsewhere. Finally, today's nonpolar world is not simply a result of the rise of other states and organizations or of the failures and follies of U.S. policy. It is also an inevitable consequence of globalization. Globalization has increased the volume, velocity, and importance of cross-border flows of just about everything, from drugs, e-mails, greenhouse gases, manufactured goods, and people to television and radio signals, viruses (virtual and real), and weapons.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">Globalization</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;reinforces nonpolarity in two fundamental ways. First, many cross-border flows take place outside the control of governments and without their knowledge. As a result, globalization&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">dilutes the influence of the major powers</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">. Second, these same flows often strengthen the capacities of nonstate actors, such as energy exporters (who are experiencing a dramatic increase in wealth owing to transfers from importers), terrorists (who use the Internet to recruit and train, the international banking system to move resources, and the global transport system to move people), rogue states (who can exploit black and gray markets), and Fortune 500 firms (who quickly move personnel and investments). It is increasingly apparent that being the strongest state no longer means having a near monopoly on power. It is easier than ever before for individuals and groups to accumulate and project substantial power. NONPOLAR DISORDER The increasingly nonpolar world will have mostly negative consequences for the United States -- and for much of the rest of the world as well.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">It will make it more difficult for Washington to lead</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;on those occasions when it seeks to promote collective responses to regional and global challenges. One reason has to do with simple arithmetic. With so many more actors possessing meaningful power and trying to assert influence, it will be more difficult to build collective responses and make institutions work. Herding dozens is harder than herding a few. The inability to reach agreement in the Doha Round of global trade talks is a telling example. Nonpolarity will also increase the number of threats and vulnerabilities facing a country such as the United States. These threats can take the form of rogue states, terrorist groups, energy producers that choose to reduce their output, or central banks whose action or inaction can create conditions that affect the role and strength of the U.S. dollar. The Federal Reserve might want to think twice before continuing to lower interest rates, lest it precipitate a further move away from the dollar. There can be worse things than a recession. Iran is a case in point. Its effort to become a nuclear power is a result of nonpolarity. Thanks more than anything to the surge in oil prices, it has become another meaningful concentration of power, one able to exert influence in Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, the Palestinian territories, and beyond, as well as within OPEC. It has many sources of technology and finance and numerous markets for its energy exports. And due to nonpolarity, the United States cannot manage Iran alone. Rather, Washington is dependent on others to support political and economic sanctions or block Tehran's access to nuclear technology and materials. Nonpolarity begets nonpolarity.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><h4 id="HProlifmakesthetransitionstablepreventinggreatpowerwar" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Prolif makes the transition stable preventing great power war</span></h4><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">Alagappa 8</span> (Muthiah, Distinguished Senior Fellow—East-West Center, in “The Long Shadow: Nuclear Weapons and Security in 21<sup>st</sup> Century Asia, Ed.

How can we define a game? Is there any useful distinction between fun, play and games? What makes games engaging? How do we design them? &nbsp;Games are a subset of both play and fun. In programming jargon they are a “child”, inheriting all the characteristics of the “parents.” They therefore carry both the good and the bad of both terms. Games, as we will see, also have some special qualities, which make them particularly appropriate and well suited for learning. &nbsp;&nbsp;So what is a game? &nbsp;Like play, game, has a wide variety of meanings, some positive, some negative. On the negative side there is mocking and jesting, illegal and shady activity such as a con game, as well as the “fun and games” that we saw earlier. As noted, these can be sources of resistance to Digital Game-Based Learning — “we are not playing games here.” But much of that is semantic. What we are interested in here are the meanings that revolve around the definition of games involving rules, contest, rivalry and struggle.</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-language:EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">What Makes a Game a Game?&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;mso-bidi-language:EN-US">Six Structural Factors &nbsp;The Encyclopedia Britannica provides the following diagram of the relation between play and games: 35 PLAY &nbsp;spontaneous play &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;organized play (GAMES) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;noncompetitive games&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">competitive games</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-language: EN-US">&nbsp;(CONTESTS)&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">intellectual contests</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-language:EN-US">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">physical contests (SPORTS) &nbsp;&nbsp;Our goal here is to understand why games engage us, drawing us in often in spite of ourselves. &nbsp;This powerful force stems first from the fact that they are a form of fun and play, and second from what I call the six key structural elements of games: &nbsp;1. Rules 2. Goals and Objectives 3. Outcomes and Feedback 4. Conflict/Competition/Challenge/Opposition &nbsp;5. Interaction, and 6. Representation or Story. &nbsp;&nbsp;There are thousands, perhaps millions of different games, but all contain most, if not all, these powerful factors. Those that don’t contain all the factors are still classified as games by many, but can also belong to other subclasses described below. In addition to these structural factors, there are also important design elements that add to engagement and distinguish a really good game from a poor or mediocre one. Let us discuss these six factors in detail and show how and why they lead to such strong engagement.</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt; font-family:&quot;TimesNewRomanPSMT&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;mso-bidi-language:EN-US">&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">Rules are what differentiate games from other kinds of play</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-language:EN-US">.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Probably the most basic definition of a game is that it is organized play, that is to say rule-based.&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">If you don’t have rules you have free play, not a game</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-language:EN-US">.

Brickhouse and Smith explain that Socrates' testing of ideas and people is a mutual testing not only of others but also of himself: Socrates claims that he has been commanded by the god to examine himself as well as others; he claims that&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">the unexamined life is not worth living</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">; and, since he rarely submits to questioning himself, "it must be that in the process of examining others Socrates regards himself as examining his own life, too."&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Such a&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow">mutual testing of ideas provides the only claim to knowledge</span> that <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">Socrates can have: since neither he nor anyone else knows the real definitions of things, he cannot claim to have any knowledge of his own; since</span>, however, <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">he subjects his beliefs to</span> repeated <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">testing, he can claim to have</span> that <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">limited human knowledge supported by</span> the <span style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">"inductive evidence"</span> of "previous elenctic examinations<span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">." This mutual testing of ideas and people is evident in the Laches and also appears in the Gorgias in Socrates' testing of his own belief that courage is inseparable from the other virtues and in his willingness to submit his belief and indeed his life to the ultimate test of divine judgment, in what Bakhtin calls a dialogue on the threshold. The contesting or challenging of others' ideas and their lives and their ritualistic crowning/decrowning is evident in the Gorgias in Soocrates' successive refutations and humiliations of Gorgias, Polus, and Callicles.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><h4 id="H3.Wesolvetheterminalimpacttoeducation2014fairnessinadebatecontextthroughtopicalityfosterstoleranceofalternativeviewpointswhichsolvesdogmatismandbigotryinsociety." class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>3.

Second,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">respondents provided demographic data so that patterns could be compared along three dimensions</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">. These dimensions, the independent variables for the student portion of the study, involved three items:&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">1) level of debate experience; 2) whether NPDA was the only format of parliamentary debate the students had experienced; and 3) whether students had participated in NDT or CEDA policy debate</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">. Third, the questions were to determine how students rated the debates based on criteria for good debate-educational value, clash, and a fair division of ground. Students were also asked two general questions: whether they would try the no-topic debate again, and whether they liked the no-topic round. These questions constituted the dependent variables for the student study. Because the sample was small, descriptive statistical data were gathered from critics. Taking into account the experience of the critics, additional questions concerning items such as whether no-topic debating deepened discussion. Both students and critics were asked which side they thought the no-topic approach favored, and the students with NDT/ CEDA policy debating experience were asked if a no-topic debating season would be good for policy debate.For the objective items, critics and students were asked to circle a number between 1 and 7 to indicate the strength of reaction to each item (Appendix I and Appendix II). In scoring responses, the most favorable rating received the highest score of seven and the least favorable rating a score of one. In some instances, values that were circled on the sheet were reversed such that the most favorable reaction to that category received the higher score. Frequency distributions and statistics were then tabulated for each question, and the anecdotal remarks were tabulated. For the student empirical data, t-tests were conducted to determine whether overall debate experience, NPDA experience, or policy experience affected how the students reacted to an item.

Alternatively, we may start by looking in the refrigerator and cupboard to see what is already there, then allowing ourselves to devise innovative ways of combining subsets of these ingredients.

Most modern legal theorists question the value of procedural regularity when it denies substantive justice.52 Some even question the whole notion of justifying a legal decision by appealing to a rule of law, versus justifying the decision by reference to the facts of the case and the judges' own reason and expe-rience.53 I do not intend to enter this important jurisprudential de-bate, except to the limited extent that the "empathy" writings have suggested that the rule-of-law chills judges' empathic reactions. In this regard, I have several observations. My first thought is that the rule-of-law model is only a model. If the term means absolute separation of legal decision and "politics," then it surely is both unrealistic and undesirable.54 But&nbsp;</span><span class="TitleChar" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">our actual</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt">statutory and</span> <span class="TitleChar" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">decisional "rules" rarely mandate a particular (unempathetic) response.

Most rules are <strong>guidelines</strong> that <strong>establish</strong> spheres of <strong>relevant</strong> <strong>conversation</strong>, <strong>not</strong> <strong>mathematical</strong> <strong>formulas</strong></span>.<span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;Moreover, legal training in a common law system emphasizes the indeterminate nature of rules and the significance of even subtle variations in facts. Our legal tradition stresses an inductive method of discovering legal principles</span>. <span class="TitleChar">We are taught to distinguish different "stories," to arrive at "law" through experience with many stories, and to revise that law as future experience requires.</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;Much of the effort of most first-year law professors is, I believe, devoted to debunking popular lay myths about "law" as clean-cut answers, and to illuminate law as a dynamic body of policy determinations constrained by certain guiding principles.55 As a practical matter, therefore,&nbsp;</span><span class="TitleChar" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">our rules often are</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">ambiguous and&nbsp;</span><span class="TitleChar" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow">fluid standards that offer<strong>&nbsp;substantial room for varying interpretations</strong></span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">.</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;The interpreter, usually a judge, may consult several sources to aid in decisionmaking. One important source necessarily will be the judge's own experiences -including the experiences that seem to determine a person's empathic capacity. In fact, much ink has been spilled to illuminate that our stated "rules" often do not dictate or explain our legal results. Some writers even have argued that a rule of law may be, at times, nothing more than a post hoc rationalization or attempted legitimization of results that may be better explained by extralegal (including, but not necessarily limited to, emotional) responses to the facts, the litigants, or the litigants' lawyers,56 all of which may go un-stated. The opportunity for contextual and empathic decisionmaking therefore already is very much a part of our adjudicatory law, despite our commitment to the rule-of-law ideal. Even when law is clear and relatively inflexible, however, it is not necessarily "unempathetic." The assumed antagonism of legality and empathy is belied by our experience in rape cases, to take one important example. In the past, judges construed the general, open-ended standard of "relevance" to include evidence about the alleged victim's prior sexual conduct, regardless of whether the conduct involved the defendant.57 The solution to this "empathy gap" was legislative action to make the law more specific - more formalized. Rape shield statutes were enacted that controlled judicial discretion and specifically defined relevance to exclude the prior sexual history of the woman, except in limited, justifiable situations.58 In this case, one can make a persuasive argument not only that the rule-of-law model does explain these later rulings, but also that obedience to that model resulted in a triumph for the human voice of the rape survivor. Without the rule, some judges likely would have continued to respond to other inclinations, and admit this testimony about rape survivors. The example thus shows that radical rule skepticism is inconsistent with at least some evidence of actual judicial behavior. It also suggests that the principle of legality is potentially most critical for people who are least understood by the decisionmakers - in this example, women - and hence most vulnerable to unempathetic ad hoc rulings. A final observation is that the principle of legality reflects a deeply ingrained, perhaps inescapable, cultural instinct.&nbsp;</span><strong><span class="TitleChar" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">We value some procedural regularity</span></strong><span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;- "law for law's sake" -&nbsp;</span><span class="TitleChar" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">because it lends&nbsp;</span><em><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt; background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">stasis and structure</span></em><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;to our often chaotic lives.&nbsp;</span><span class="TitleChar" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">Even within our most intimate relationships, we both establish "rules," and expect the other party to follow them</span><span class="TitleChar">.</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">59&nbsp;</span><span class="TitleChar" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">Breach of these</span><span class="TitleChar">&nbsp;unspoken&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">agreements can destroy the relationship and hurt us deeply,&nbsp;</span><em><span style="font-size:12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">regardless of the wisdom or "substantive fairness"</span></em><span class="TitleChar" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">&nbsp;of a particular rule.

In this manner, a back-end adjustment process is consistent with the pragmatic approach to public policy that we advocated in the book.5</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">This article addresses in more detail the potential of two</span><span class="TitleChar">&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">types of back-end processes</span>: (1) deadline extensions and (2) <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">waivers</span>, exceptions, and variances<span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">.6 Our analysis proceeds in three steps. Part II describes the almost exclusive focus of regulatory reformers on the front end of the process. Part III offers a close examination of five federal statutes that provide opportunities for the two types of adjustments we are studying. The results confirm our earlier assertion that Congress has authorized agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and the Interior Department to make these types of back-end adjustments available in a variety of contexts and for a variety of reasons.? Our analysis reveals that&nbsp;</span><span class="TitleChar" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow">Congress has established</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;six different&nbsp;</span><span class="TitleChar" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">grounds for back-end adjustment</span><span class="TitleChar">,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">and we assess the potential for each of these grounds to improve regulatory policy. Although we recommend the imposition of conditions on the issuance of some of these back-end adjustments, we find that&nbsp;</span><span class="TitleChar">these adjustments are generally consistent with the precautionary tilt of the statutes in which they are located because they still require the regulated entity to do the best it can to protect&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">people and the environment. Where such protective mechanisms are absent, we urge that the statutes be amended to include them.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Part IV analyzes the procedures by which requests for back-end adjustments are currently processed. We find that agencies consider most applications for back-end adjustments using informal procedures that include public notice and solicitation of public comments, although in a few instances, more formal procedures apply. We favor the informal approach because it is an efficient way for agencies to respond to the issues raised by requests for back-end adjustments and because more elaborate procedures are not necessary to promote rational decisionmaking, given the nature of the issues likely to be raised in back-end adjustment proceedings. We are concerned, however, about the extent to which effective public participation will occur under these procedures. We therefore endorse two steps to enhance the transparency of back-end adjustment decision-making: the establishment of electronic reading rooms and the issuance by agencies of annual reports on back-end ad- justments.8 We argue that&nbsp;</span><span class="TitleChar" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">these</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;two&nbsp;</span><span class="TitleChar" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">mechanisms</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;will&nbsp;</span><span class="TitleChar" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">facilitate involvement by public interest groups</span><span class="TitleChar">&nbsp;and interested citizens&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">by allowing them to prioritize</span> the <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">adjustment proceedings</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;in which they wish to become involved.&nbsp;</span><em><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt; background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">The result is</span></em><em><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;likely to be&nbsp;</span></em><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11pt; background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow">enhanced agency accountability and reduced opportunities for agency abuse</span></em><em><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;of the back-end adjustment process</span></em><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">.</span></p></div></div></td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>11/09/2012</td><td style="width:100%; word-wrap:break-word;"><div><!--  <input type="image" onclick="deleteEntry('9', 'http://opencaselist.paperlessdebate.com/xwiki/rest/wikis/opencaselist/spaces/Emory/pages/Pesce-Sigalos Neg/objects/Admin.EntryClass/')" value="Delete" title="Delete" style="float:right;" src="/xwiki/resources/icons/silk/cross.gif" />

Deterrence works because nuclear weapons enable one state to punish another state severely without first defeating it. "Victory," in Thomas Schelling's words, "is no longer a prerequisite for hurting the enemy." 37 Countries armed only with conventional weapons can hope that their military forces will be able to limit the damage an attacker can do. Among countries armed with strategic nuclear forces, the hope of avoiding heavy damage depends mainly on the attacker's restraint and little on one's own efforts. Those who compared expected deaths through strategic exchanges of nuclear warheads with casualties suffered by the Soviet Union in World War II overlooked the fundamental difference between conventional and nuclear worlds. 38</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="TitleChar">Deterrence rests on what countries can do to each other with strategic nuclear weapons.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">From this statement,&nbsp;</span><span class="TitleChar">one can&nbsp;</span><em><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">easily leap to the wrong conclusion</span></em><span class="TitleChar">: that deterrent strategies, if they have to be carried through, will produce a catastrophe.&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">That countries are able to annihilate each other means neither that deterrence depends on their threatening to do so nor that they will</span> necessarily do so <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">if deterrence fails</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">.

The United States had the ability to place thousands of warheads precisely on targets in the Soviet Union. Surely we would have struck military targets before striking industrial targets and industrial targets before striking cities. The intent to hit military targets first was sometimes confused with a war-fighting strategy, but it was not one. It would not have significantly reduced the Soviet Union's ability to hurt us. Whatever American military leaders thought, our strategy rested on the threat to punish.&nbsp;</span><span class="TitleChar" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">The threat, if it failed</span><span class="TitleChar">&nbsp;to deter,&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">would have been followed not by&nbsp;</span>spasms of <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow">violence but by punishment</span> administered in ways <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">that conveyed threats of more to come</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">A war between the United States and the Soviet Union that got out of control would have been catastrophic.

As ever, the biggest international dangers come from the strongest states. Fearing the world's destruction, one may prefer a world of conventional great powers having a higher probability of fighting less- destructive wars to a world of nuclear great powers having a lower probability of fighting more-destructive wars.

It should be noted that, of the crises that involved four nuclear actors—Suez Nationalization War (1956), Berlin Wall (1961), October Yom Kippur War (1973), and Iraq No-Fly Zone (1992)—and five nuclear actors—Gulf War (1990)—only two are not full-scale wars. While this demonstrates that the pacifying effect of more nuclear actors is not strong enough to prevent war in all situations, it does not necessarily weaken the argument that there is actually a pacifying effect. The positive and statistically significant coefficient on the variable that counts the number of crisis actors has a magnitude greater than that on the variable that counts the number of nuclear actors. Since increases in the number of overall actors in a crisis are strongly associated with higher levels of violence, it should be no surprise that many of the conflicts with many nuclear actors—by extension, many general actors as well—experienced war. Therefore, the results can only suggest that,&nbsp;</span><span class="TitleChar">keeping the number of crisis actors fixed, increasing the proportion of nuclear actors has a pacifying effect</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">. They do not suggest that adding nuclear actors to a crisis will decrease the risk of high levels violence; but rather, adding more actors of any type to a crisis can have a destabilizing effect. Also in Table IV,&nbsp;</span><span class="TitleChar">Model 2 demonstrates that the effect of a nuclear dyad is only approaching statistical significance</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, but does have a sign that indicates higher levels of violence are less likely in crises with opponents that have nuclear weapons than other crises.&nbsp;</span><span class="TitleChar">This</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;lukewarm result&nbsp;</span><span class="TitleChar">suggests that it might not be necessary for nuclear actors to face each other in order to get the effect of decreased propensity for violence.</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;</span><strong><span class="TitleChar" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">All actors</span></strong><strong><span class="TitleChar">&nbsp;should&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">tend to be more cautious</span></strong><strong>&nbsp;in escalation <span style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">when there is a nuclear opponent</span>, regardless of their own capabilities</strong><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">. While this might weaken support for focusing on specifically a ‘balance of terror’ as a source of stability (see Gaddis, 1986; Waltz, 1990; Sagan and Waltz, 2003; Mearsheimer, 1990),&nbsp;</span><strong><span class="TitleChar">it supports the logic in this article that&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">nuclear weapons</span></strong><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;can serve as a&nbsp;</span><strong><span class="TitleChar" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">deter</span></strong><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">rent of&nbsp;</span><strong><span class="TitleChar" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">aggression</span></strong><strong><span class="TitleChar">&nbsp;from both nuclear and non-nuclear opponents</span></strong><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">.6 Model 3 transforms the violence variable to a binary indicator of war and demonstrates that the principal relationship between the number of nuclear actors and violence holds for the most crucial outcome of full-scale war.&nbsp;</span><span class="TitleChar">Model 4 demonstrates that accounting for the presence of new nuclear actors does not greatly change the results.</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;</span><span class="TitleChar" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">The coefficient on the new nuclear actor variable is</span><span class="TitleChar">&nbsp;statistically&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">insignificant, which lends credence to the</span> optimists’ <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow">view that new nuclear</span>-weapon <span style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">states should not</span> be presupposed to <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">behave less responsibly</span> than the USA, USSR, UK, France, and China did during the Cold War<span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">. Finally, Model 5 similarly illustrates that crises involving superpowers are not more or less prone to violence than others. Superpower activity appears to not be driving the observed relationships between the number of nuclear-crisis actors and restraint toward violence. It is important to establish more specifically what the change in the probability of full-scale war is when nuclear actors are involved. Table V presents the probability of different levels of violence as the number of nuclear actors increases in the Clarify simulations. The control variables are held at their modes or means, with the exception of the variable that counts the number of crisis actors. Because it would be impossible to have, say, five nuclear-crisis actors and only two crisis actors, the number of crisis actors is held constant at five. As we can see,&nbsp;</span><span class="TitleChar">the impact of an increase in the number of nuclear actors is substantial.&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">Starting from a crisis</span> situation <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">without any nuclear actors, including one</span> nuclear actor (out of five) <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">reduces the likelihood of</span> fullscale <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">war by nine percentage points</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">.&nbsp;</span><span class="TitleChar" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">As we</span><span class="TitleChar">&nbsp;continue to&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">add nuclear actors, the likelihood of</span> full-scale <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow">war declines sharply</span>, so that the probability of a war with the maximum number of nuclear actors is about three times less than the probability with no nuclear actors<span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">.

While we control for the strategic selection of serious threats within crises, we are unable to control for the non-random initial initiation of a crisis in which the actors may choose to enter a crisis based on some ex ante assessment of the outcomes.&nbsp;</span><span class="TitleChar">To account for possible selection bias caused by the use of a truncated sample that does not include any non-crisis cases,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">one would need to use another dataset in which the crisis cases are a subset and then run Heckman type selection models (see Lemke and Reed, 2001). It would, however, be difficult to think of a different unit of analysis that might be employed, such that the set of crises is a subset of a larger category of interaction. While dyadyear datasets have often been employed to similar ends, the key independent variable here, which is specific to crises as the unit of analysis, does not lend itself to a dyadic setup. Moreover, selection bias concerns are likely not valid in disputing the claims of this analysis</span><span class="TitleChar">. If selection bias were present, it would tend to bias the effect of nuclear weapons downward, because the set of observed crises with nuclear actors likely has a disproportionate share of resolved actors that have chosen to take their chances against a nuclear opponent. Despite this potential mitigating bias, the results are statistically significant, which strengthens the case for the explanations provided in this study</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">.</span></p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p align="center" class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:10.0pt;text-align:center; page-break-before:always;mso-pagination:widow-orphan lines-together;page-break-after: avoid;mso-outline-level:3"><strong><span style="font-size:16.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"><ins>1NR-~--Slow</ins></span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:10.0pt;mso-pagination:widow-orphan lines-together; page-break-after:avoid;mso-outline-level:4"><strong><span style="font-size:13.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-bidi-font-style: italic">Prolif will be slow even in the new era.</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Tepperman 9</span></strong> (Jonathon, former Deputy Managing Ed.

His claim rests primarily on the assumption that all new nuclear states will believe they only need to threaten adversaries with the destruction of one or two cities to ensure stable deterrence, and that they subsequently will be reluctant to dedicate massive resources to building large nuclear arsenals.' My claim is less broad, and it concerns only stares in the developing world. I argue&nbsp;</span><ins>that conditions in the <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">developing world</span> are such that whether <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow">leaders</span> think they need to be able to destroy only one city or believe they should have the capability to achieve complete societal destruction of an adversary, they <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow">very likely will judge that only very small nuclear arsenals are needed</span> for the job.</ins><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;Moreover, because conditions are such that arsenal buildups will exact high economic, political and security costs on developing states, it is very unlikely they will build more weapons than they believe they need. What follows is an examination of the specific conditions on which these claims are based.&nbsp;</span><ins>There are five main reasons to expect small arsenals among nuclear states in the developing world. They include <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">1) the limited number of targets</span> developing states will have <span style="background: yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">to worry about</span>, <span style="background: yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">2) fears concerning</span> <span style="background: yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">'regional suicide' through nuclear fallout</span>, <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">3) economic constraints</span> related to nuclear production and military budgets, <span style="background: yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">4)</span> the specific manner in which developing states reap <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">political rewards</span> and prestige <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">from nuclear weapons development, and 5) the requirements of keeping</span> nuclear <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">arsenals opaque</span></ins><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">. These factors can carry a cumulative weight in developing state proliferators, which is to say that their cumulative effect may serve to constrain arsenal buildup when the individual effect of any one of them may not be sufficient. They also reinforce each other in important ways, meaning that if policymakers recognize the existence of one or some of the conditions they are likely to recognize most or all of them, and thus their cumulative weight is likely CO be felt. Not all the factors discussed here will apply to all proliferators and potential proliferators in the developing world; however, it is not necessary that they do. It is simply necessary that enough of the factors apply, or that one of them applies strongly enough, to generate the essential constraining effects. This is very likely to be the case in all developing world situations.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p align="center" class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:10.0pt;text-align:center; page-break-before:always;mso-pagination:widow-orphan lines-together;page-break-after: avoid;mso-outline-level:3"><strong><span style="font-size:16.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"><ins>1NR-~--AT: Horowitz</ins></span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:10.0pt;mso-pagination:widow-orphan lines-together; page-break-after:avoid;mso-outline-level:4"><strong><span style="font-size:13.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-bidi-font-style: italic">He concedes this is the focus of the study.</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Horowitz 9</span></strong> (Michael, Assistant Prof. Pol.

The indeterminacy of much of the deterrence literature highlights the importance of rigorous testing (Downs 1989; George and Smoke 1989; Jervis 1989b). Scholars have disagreed, extensively, over how states in deterrence crises calculate the costs and benefits of different actions (Huth and Russett 1990, 466). Many scholars argue that nuclear proliferation is likely to lead to more international conflict, although some disagree.Waltz, for example, argues that nuclear weapons deter challengers and take escalation off the table, making disputes less likely. The balance of threat from nuclear escalation outweighs issue-specific calculations of interests. According to Waltz, the risk of nuclear escalation trumps any uncertainty generated by nuclear acquisition, making postproliferation conflicts less likely (Waltz 1995, 5-8).&nbsp;</span><ins>A simple measurement problem limits existing research on nuclear war; all observations after 1945 are censored and end in a condition of no nuclear war.

Military officers are likely to see war as inevitable; they usually distrust nonmilitary approaches to international conflict; they are likely to neglect the nonmilitary costs and consequences of preventive war; and they usually favor offensive doctrines and decisive operations over protracted or delayed conflicts7. 5Although Sagan provides only anecdotal evidence in support of these controversial generalizations about military thinking,&nbsp;</span><ins>let us suppose that he is correct -</ins><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;suppose that military officers do favor preventive war.&nbsp;</span><ins><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">It is quite another matter to expect these officers to favor preventive war against nuclear targets</span></ins><ins>&nbsp;</ins><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">(where the cost of failure could be exorbitant),&nbsp;</span><ins>or to expect their civilian leaders to authorize such risky military conduct</ins><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">. In anticipation of these points, Sagan relates several episodes in which u.s. military officers planned and seriously advocated preventive-war options to destroy the emergent nuclear arsenal of the Soviet Union during the first decade of the cold war. Although Truman and Eisenhower ultimately ruled against these measures, Sagan believes that these cases support his argument about the biases of military organizations in favor of preventive nuclear war. This leads him to expect that such attacks will be carried out in the future by states having weak civilian control over their militaries. There are two problems with this argument. The first concerns Sagan's extrapolation of military roles from the U.S. experience to the context of new nuclear states.&nbsp;</span><ins><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Even if</span></ins><ins>&nbsp;we accept that <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">U.S. military officers are biased</span> in favor of preventive options, <span style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">it does not follow that other militaries will share this bias</span>.</ins><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;As Richard Betts relates, "statesmen and soldiers are partners in preventing war and fighting it."&nbsp;</span><ins>Since the primary job of civilian authorities in the United States is to ensure that deterrence does not fail, <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">military officials plan ways to limit damage</span> and win the war if deterrence does fail</ins><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">!' Not all countries around the world have the luxury of dividing these roles in this manner. In countries with weak civilian control - the countries with which Sagan is especially concerned - military officers assume many of the duties that civilians perform in the United States and in other nations in which civilian control is strict.&nbsp;</span><ins>Consider the case of Pakistan</ins><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">. Apart from the traditional military duties of recruitment, training, discipline, and strategic planning, Pakistan's military leadership plays an active part in deciding when, where, and how to use military force.&nbsp;</span><ins><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Because Pakistani military officers assume</span></ins><ins>&nbsp;much of the <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">responsibility for</span> ensuring the country's <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow">national security</span> and well-being, <span style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">they display few</span> of the <span style="background: yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">biases</span> Sagan observes among American officers.</ins><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;Pakistani officers do not see war with India as inevitable; they do not distrust nonmilitary approaches to international conflict; and they do not neglect the nonmilitary costs and consequences of preventive war. The second problem with Sagan's argument about preventive war lies with his inductive analysis of the new nuclear states themselves.&nbsp;</span><ins>Sagan cites the pre-nuclear case of Pakistan to illustrate his concern</ins><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;about preventive war among new nuclear states. He rightly observes that the 1965 war between Pakistan and India began as a Pakistani attempt to wrest control of Indian-held Kashmir before India's rearmament effort - which began after India's loss to China in the 1962 Himalayan border war - would forever shift the regional balance of power. A deal with the Soviet Union to build on Indian soil an assembly factory for MiG aircraft and the prospect that India might also receive American F- 104s convinced President Ayub Khan and his young foreign minister, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, to take preventive military action against India." In the end, however, Pakistan's Operation Grand Slam was a failure.&nbsp;</span><ins>Pakistan never again attempted a preventive military campaign against India</ins><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">. 80 Why, then, does Sagan fear preventive military attacks by Pakistan against Indian nuclear facilities in the future?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;</span></p><p align="center" class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:10.0pt;text-align:center; page-break-before:always;mso-pagination:widow-orphan lines-together;page-break-after: avoid;mso-outline-level:3"><strong><span style="font-size:16.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"><ins>1NR-~--AT: Knopf</ins></span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:10.0pt;mso-pagination:widow-orphan lines-together; page-break-after:avoid;mso-outline-level:4"><strong><span style="font-size:13.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-bidi-font-style: italic">Lots of historical disproof</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Alagappa 8</span></strong> (Muthiah, Distinguished Senior Fellow – East-West Center, in “The Long Shadow: Nuclear Weapons and Security in 21<sup>st</sup> Century Asia, Ed.

Thus, when I talk of 'economic growth' I am referring to 'undifferentiated, orthodox economic growth' as measured by conventional national accounting measurements such as GDP. One of the foci of analysis for green critiques of economic growth is consumerism, since consumerism has become a central driver and is functional for contemporary economic growth policies. As the current economic crisis aptly demonstrates, if (too many) people save rather than consume, the capitalist system becomes unstable and does not function. One of the critiques of consumerism is based on the notion that&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">easy&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow">consumption 'devalues' that which is consumed</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">-&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">hence the</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">disposable, banal, and</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;ephemeral, but constantly&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">repetitious character of modern consumerism</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">There is no sense of</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;the&nbsp;</span><span style="background: yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">fragility</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;(despite the evident ephemerality)&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">or</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;any associated sense of&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">preciousness&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">attached to the</span> mass produced <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">goods</span> and services <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">consumed</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">. Consumerism denotes an attitude towards that consumed of indifference, repetition, with little connection or meaningful connection made-one good or service is as good as another. The 'repressive tolerance' which defines the consumer experience and its associated highly disciplined subjectivities, was outlined by Marcuse (and others) over fifty years ago as characterizing modern Western capitalist societies (Marcuse, 1964). This still has analytical purchase and remains an apt description today of those societies. As Murray Bookchin points out, the judgement of a repressed psyche is not a good standard for determining what is 'good' and virtuous and what is not (Bookchin, 1982). One of the upshots of the analysis of vulnerability, developed in ohapter 2, for green politics is a reaffirmation of the need to examine issues of identity and the creation of new 'sustainability' and 'resilient' subjectivities, against the repressive tolerant. consumer identities which demarcate the limit of 'normal' and hence 'possible' or 'desirable' identities. Whether it is the putative identities and practices one can discern within the Transition movement, or the cultivation of virtue and certain character traits for green political and economic practices (such as 'green citizenship'), vulnerability and resilience are suggestive of specific types of virtue (such as compassion, care, courage, prudence, temperance, self-assuredness, steadfastness, sensuality, humility, and materiality-as opposed to 'materialism'). They also denote certain types of character traits, such as that of the 'pioneer' and 'dissident'.

Dissidents seek to direct a self transforming present in a more radical direction, whereas revolutionaries typically seek the complete destruction of the existing order and then the construction of a new one. Greens as dissidents also begin from an acceptance of the inevitability of key aspects of this transition-primarily around climate change and the end of the oil age-and thus see an answer to 'what is to be done?' in terms of managing and shaping that inevitable transition, rather than building/re-building. Dissident also seems less extreme and dogmatic in its critique and its demands, than those who advocate full-blown revolution. And given what was said in chapter 3 and elsewhere about the link between creativity, flexibility, and adaptive fitness, it would be odd for green politics to be dogmatic revolutionaries animated by a sense of the hopelessness of working within and through contemporary institutiohs or that there was nothing worth preserving within and from the contemporary social order.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Green dissent could</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;perhaps be (wrongly) described as somewhere on a continuum between 'reformism' and 'revolution', a form of 'creative adaptive management' to&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">create collective resilience in the face of actually existing unsustainability.</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">1 In his essay 'The Power of the Powerless', Vaclav&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Havel uses the story of a greengrocer who unthinkingly displays his 'loyalty' to the regime by displaying a Communist Party slogan in his shop</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">This the greengrocer does 'ritualistically, since this is the only way the regime is capable of acknowledging his display of loyalty'</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;(Havel, 1978: 45).

So while critics such as Fromm are correct in highlighting the distinction in consumer culture between 'being' and 'having' (Fromm, 1976), what these analyses often miss is that consumption is also an act of' &nbsp;belonging' and identity affirmation (Keat, 1994; Jackson, 2009b).It is for this reason that a refusal to consume is so damaging to the modern political and economic order and why to consciously choose not to consume is perhaps one of the most politically significant acts one can do in a consumer society. And one that, the continual performance (or rather non-performance) of which, further marks one out as a dissident, part of 'the great refusal' to use Marcuse's term (Marcuse, 1964). That is,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">to question</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;economic&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">growth</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;under consumer capitalism&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">is to be 'disloyal'</span> to the prevailing order<span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">. While for Havel living in what he calls the 'post-totalitarian' communist regime is 'living a lie', I do not want to go so far and say that life in contemporary consumer capitalist democracies is in the same way to 'live a lie'. Rather what I would like to dwell upon is Havel's notion of'living within the truth' and what this can offer for green dissidents.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">For Havel 'living within the truth</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;...&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">can be any means by which a person or group revolts against manipulation</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">: anything from&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">a letter by intellectuals to</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;a workers'&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">strike</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, from a rock concert to a student demonstration, from refusing to vote in the farcical elections, to making an open speech at some official congress, or even a hunger strike' (Havel, 1986: 59-60). Though clearly written with the then communist regime in mind, Havel's call to 'live in truth' is equally pertinent to consumer capitalism. As he puts it: The profound crisis of human identity brought on by living within a lie, a crisis which in turn makes such a life possible, certainly possesses a moral dimension as well; it appears, among other things, as a deep moral crisis in society.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">A person</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;who has been&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">seduced by the consumer</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;value system, whose identity is dissolved in an amalgam of the accoutrements of mass civilization,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">and who has</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;not roots in the order of being,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">no sense of responsibility for anything higher than</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;his or her own personal&nbsp;</span><span style="background: yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">survival, is a&nbsp;</span><em><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow">demoralized person</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">.

For Havel&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the re-appropriation of individual responsibility is something to be actively striven for</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">. This reverses or balances the usual focus on rights and freedoms with which often 'progressive' critiques of consumerism are couched. In Havel's response to what Tim Jackson amongst others has called 'The Age of Irresponsibility' (Jackson, 2009b ), also connects with some of the green republican arguments outlined in chapters 6 and 7, not least the stress on both the recovery of the good of politics and the centrality of the individual citizen as a moral being and not just or only a consumer (or producer/worker or investor). As Jackson notes, 'the "age of irresponsibility" is not about casual oversight or individual greed. The economic crisis is not a consequence of isolated malpractice in selected parts of the banking sector. If there has been irresponsibility, it has been much more systemic, sanctioned from the top, and with one clear aim in mind: the continuation and protection of economic growth' (Jackson, 2009b: 26; emphasis added).&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The struggle Havel describes from the 1968 'Prague Spring' between 'the system' and 'the aims of life'</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;(Havel, 1978: 66) re</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">sonate green concerns of the degradation of natural life-supporting systems and the undermining of conditions promoting human conviviality, quality of life, and well-being</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;(Barry, 2009b; De Geus, 2009, 2003; Jackson, 2009a). What Havel goes on to say about political change and strategy in the context of a consumer culture is pertinent and important for those seeking a transition away from unsustainability, 'Society is not sharply polarized on the level of actual political power, but ...&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the fundamental lines of conflict run right through each person</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">' (Havel, 1978: 91; emphasis added). This is a profound point, namely that it is difficult, if not impossible, to simply analyse actually existing unsustainability as an oppressive totalitarian regime in which there is an identifiable 'them' dominating 'us'. Under consumer capitalism, debt-based consumption, and so on, we who live in these societies are all implicated in its continuation. And while of course there are identifiable groups and institutions (such as large corporations, financial wealth management firms, the leadership of mainstream political parties, key agencies of the nation state such as departments of finance, global financial institutions such as the World Bank and the IMP, and what Sklair has called&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">the</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;'transnational&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">capitalist class'</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">) who do&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">benefit more from</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;actually existing&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">unsustainability</span>,<span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">we have to face up to the fact that&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">'ordinary people'</span>, that is, everyone <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">also contributes</span> (unequally of course) <span style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">to the</span> 'mundane' operation of global capitalism and the <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">exploitation of people and planet</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">. The recognition of this is but another way of drawing attention to the fact that capitalism,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the common sense of&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">neoclassical economics</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, and so on&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">have achieved</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;'full spectrum'&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">domination of hearts and minds</span>,<span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;such that capitalism,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">and realistic&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">critiques</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;of it,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">need to be viewed as&nbsp;</span><em><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow">cultural</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;(and</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;indeed&nbsp;</span><em><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">psychological)&nbsp;</span></em><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11pt; background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow">projects</span></em><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">. It is for this reason that I canvassed the Transition movement in chapter 3, since it adopts an explicitly cultural and psychological approach. Of course such cultural and psychological critical analyses are not exhausted by this movement and these cannot be a substitute for oppositional political struggle.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">This 'cultural turn' in green politics</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;is</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, to my mind, linked to&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the 'postscarcity economics of sustainable desire'</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;outlined in chapter 5,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">and&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">is premised</span> firmly <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">on a notion of human flourishing</span> that lies <em><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow">beyond</span></em><em><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;production,&nbsp;</span></em><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11pt; background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow">'supplyside' solutions</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, 'competiveness'</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, and increasing 'labour productivity'.

Let me make that abundantly clear,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">it is not an ascetic renunciation</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;of materialism for its own sake, as if material life is intrinsically unworthy or does not express valued modes of human being. Thus I do not accept the Fromm-inspired view that materialism or indeed material consumption is simply a mode of 'having' and not 'being'.

That Havel conceives consumer-capitalist and communist societies as comparable can be seen in his view that:&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">traditional</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;parliamentary&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">democracies</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;can&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">offer no</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;fundamental&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">opposition to the&nbsp;</span><em><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow">autonomism</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">&nbsp;of</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;technological civilization, and&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">the</span> industrial-<span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">consumer society</span>,<span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;for they, too, are being dragged helplessly along by it. People are manipulated in ways that are infinitely more subtle and refined than the brutal methods used in the post-totalitarian societies ... the omnipresent dictatorship of consumption, production, advertising, commerce, consumer culture, and all that flood of information. (Havel, 1978: 116; emphasis added) Some of the republican elements expressed in Havel's thought centre around 'responsibility' (Havel, 1986: 104). He maintains that the abdication of responsibility in the name of consumer choice-what I have elsewhere described as the reduction of political liberty to a consumer 'freedom of choice' (Barry, 2009a)-weakens the ethical and political capacities of citizens within liberal democracies.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Liberal&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow">consumer-citizens</span> then become 'victims of the same autonomism, and <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">are incapable of transcending concerns about their</span> own personal <span style="background: yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">survival to become</span> proud and <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">responsible members of the polis</span>,<span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">making a genuine contribution to the creation of its destiny'</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;(Havel, 1978: 116; emphasis added). In this Havel is articulating concerns very close to the type of green republicanism outlined in this book. His concluding comments in The Power of the Powerless also offer suggestive lines for interpreting the Transition movement. In a passage focusing on the contours of what Havel calls&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the 'existential revolution'</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;that&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">is needed to renew the relationship of humans to the 'human order and cosmopolitan responsibility'</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, Havel notes that the structures needed to make this happen 'should naturally arise from below as a consequence of authentic "selforganization"; they should derive energy from a living dialogue with the genuine needs from which they arise, and when these needs are gone, the structures should also disappear ... The decisive criterion of this "selfconstitution" should be the structure's actual significance and not just a mere abstract norm' (Havel, 1978: 119). A better description of the Transition movement's aims, motivations, and objectives would be hard to find. Havel goes on to describe these new, provisional, and practical structures 'postdemocratic'. He describes the outlines of these 'authentic' political structures in this manner: Do not these groups emerge, live, and disappear under pressure from concrete and authentic needs, unburdened by the ballast of hollow traditions? Is not their attempt to create an articulate form of 'living within the truth' and to renew the feeling of higher responsibility in an apathetic society really a sign of some rudimentary moral reconstitution? In other words, are riot these informed, non-bureaucratic dynamic and open communities that comprise the 'parallel polis' a kind of rudimentary prefiguration, a symbolic model of those more meaningful 'post-democratic' political structures that might become the foundation of a better society? (Havel, 1978: 120-121). Fundamental here, I think, is Havel's call to responsibility and struggle against the prevailing political order when it undermines quality of life, perpetuates injustice, or the denial or compromising of democratic norms. In a similar vein Carla Emery puts it eloquently, 'People have to choose what they're going to struggle for.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Life is always a struggle, whether or not you're struggling for anything worthwhile, so it might as well be for something worthwhile'</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;(in Astyk, 2008: 204). Or to phrase it differently: get busy living or get busy dying. WHAT IF WE ARE THE PEOPLE WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR? 289 As argued throughout this book in facing the many challenges of the present time-climate change, peak oil, diminishing forms of social well-being, financial and economic crises, and the ecological liquidation of the foundations of life on the planet-the most important response needed is one which explicitly focuses on imagination and creativity. As W. B. Yeats (long before Barak Obama used a version of these sentiments) suggested, what is needed is for us 'to seek a remedy ... in audacity of speculation and creation' (Yeats, 1926). While&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">'another world is possible' it can only be possible if it is imagined</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, and perhaps&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">one of the most persistent obstacles to the transition</span> away from actually existing unsustainability apart from ignorance of the ecological and human costs of our capitalist-consumer way of life-<span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow">is the</span> stultifying <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow">grip of&nbsp;</span><em><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">'business as usual'</span></em><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow">&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">and its</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">limited and</span> <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">limiting horizons of possible futures</span> for ourselves and our societies<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">. In many respects,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">our</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;collective&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">inability to respond to 'limits to growth' is</span> in large measure <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">due to&nbsp;</span><em><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow">limits of</span></em><em><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;creativity and&nbsp;</span></em><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11pt; background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow">imagination</span></em><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">. We cannot, or find it very difficult, to imagine a different social order. For Richard Norgaard the answer to our present ecological predicament is as difficult to achieve as it is simple to express, 'We need a new life story. We need an overarching story that respects a diversity of life stories.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Living the story of economic development is destroying humanity and nature and a good many other species along with us. We need a master story that puts our hope, compassion, brains, sociality, and diversity to new and constructive ends'</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;(in Deb, 2009: xxiii). And if we follow Havel, it may be that this new story we need is already here, in the same sense that the eco-feminist Mary Mellor (Mellor, 1995) has persuasively written that&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">the sustainable world</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">,</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;society, or mode of being&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">is not some utopian 'there' but an already living</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, embodied, engendered&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">'here' in the</span> reproductive and exploited labour of women, in the 'core' <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">economic activity of caring</span> and sharing and ... flourishing<span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">. The Polanyi-inspired attempt to 'reembed' the economy within human social relations can be viewed as a defensive move to protect community from both the formal market and the state. Such&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">protective measures</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;can&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">include</span> the expansion of the social economy, or the <span style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">efforts</span> by the Transition movement in seeking <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">to</span> disrupt, slow down and <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">re-conceptualize the economy</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">. Such reactive measures could all be thought of as seeking to defend and extend those sustainable practices in the here and now, that is, that already exist within 'actually existing unsustainability'.

As Havel suggests, 'For the real question is whether the "brighter future" is really always so distant. What if, on the contrary, it has been here for a long time already, and only our own blindness and weakness has prevented us from seeing it around us and within us, and kept us from developing it?' (Havel, 1978: 122). Now there's an intriguing set of concluding thoughts-what if not only the resilient, sustainable way of life is 'always already here', present, and available to us if we so choose-but also if it is indeed the case that 'we are the people we've been waiting for?' And what of the hard greens, where do they and their analysis fit within this book? For it is fair to say that they have been shadowing the book. While I discussed them briefly in the Introduction and made some casual comments about them and their diverse positions and prescriptions throughout, I have not met them head on as it were. So it would be fitting for me to offer my thoughts on the place and status of the hard green position. Are they basically correct? Do I agree with them (from the green republican acceptance of the time-bound and contingent character of all human creations, including civilizations and societies) that they have identified the beginning of the end of our existing capitalist, carbon-based civilization and societies? While I certainly admire their brutal honesty, I baulk at their jump from crisis to collapse, and then from collapse to violence and 'de-civilization' (Elias, 2000; Hine and Kingsnorth, 2010). Their political analyses echo (almost always unwittingly) the eco-authoritarian position of the late 1960s and early 1970s. The hard-green view in being so pessimistic means its pessimism precludes a view of politics as the 'art of the possible', and a view of the inevitability of collapse can and does lead to de-politicized or even anti-political responses. But surely&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the challenge</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, as outlined by the green republican project of this book,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">is to embrace new intelligibilities, ways of being, having, and doing, new identities and subjectivities, and new arts of life</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, all must be part of a project to avert collapse?2 This is, as I see it, the point of green republican politics as a form of 'anticipatory politics' to challenge the rule of the 'nee-liberal vulgate'. At this present moment, on the cusp of this 'Great Transition',&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">what greens need is</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;to cultivate critical awareness, opposition, and&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">dissent, to have the courage of their convictions in</span> analysing and <span style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">resisting</span> actually existing <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">unsustainability</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, and outlining their vision for the transition to a better society, in part to engage, inform, and prepare citizens for the coming changes that will characterize the decades ahead. Greens need to be realistic and cleareyed in their disavowal of naive utopianism, but convinced of its basic conviction that another world is possible, necessary, and desirable. And while on quiet mornings we may hear it coming, its arrival, like all major transitions in human history, will demand political struggle. The battle for hearts, minds, and hands has begun, and my writing this book and you reading it are constitutive of that struggle.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><h3 id="HAT:CTP2FSpillover" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>AT: CTP/Spillover</span></h3><h4 id="HSmallmomentumandchangeinlanguageisthebasisforlarge-scalessocialchange." class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Small momentum and change in language is the basis for large-scales social change.</span></h4><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">Princen 10</span>—Thomas Princen School of Natural Resources and Environment @ Michigan <em>Treading Softly</em> p. 50-53</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">A Crisis People won't change until there's a crisis.

It is true that when there is a crisis people come together. When the town floods, everyone pitches in to stack sandbags and evacuate the elderly. But to conclude that people will only act when there's a crisis defies logic-and a whole lot of history. I will give an example of such history, but first let's put the general point right up front:&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">Fundamental social change starts with</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;(1) a&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">few&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">committed people</span>,<span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">new understandings, and</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background: yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">small acts</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;that eventually confront the structures of power.</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;And for motive, fundamental change draws on people's basic need for meaning, engagement, and fairness.

Indeed, it was an institution-a set of widely shared norms and principles, rules and procedures. And what people back then shared-rulers and commoners alike-was the idea that some people, by virtue of birth or race or nationality, would be slaves. That's just the way it was, and everyone knew it; it was beyond questioning. Always has been, always will be.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">Then a dozen shopkeepers</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;and clergy</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;got together in a print shop in London in 1787 and said, in effect, no more; this is wrong; it must stop. So they set about gathering information on what was really happening on slave ships and on the plantations. They distributed brochures and pamphlets and lectured across England and abroad.

But notice that for the <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">early abolitionists</span>, there was no crisis: They were quite comfortable<span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">. Their country was riding high. Life was good. Those shopkeepers and clergy and a few noblemen simply concluded that slavery was wrong. Others might have foreseen slavery's demise due to economic trends or movements for democracy and individual rights. But for much of this early history of abolition, there was no crisis. Instead, a few people acquired new understandings, took a strong moral stance, and confronted power. They took on one of the most pervasive, most accepted, most "necessary" structures in human history-slavery. And&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">they&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow">did not back down when</span> defenders <span style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">ridiculed</span> them<span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">when some claimed that the economy would collapse&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">and people would be thrown out of work, that the empire required it. The abolitionists spoke truth to power. And the truth was that Britain and the world as a whole would do quite well without slavery. In fact, if one accepts the maxim that slavery degrades slave and slaveholder alike, Britain and the world did better without slavery. But notice: there was nothing normal or inevitable, and certainly nothing moral, about slavery. Today&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">there is nothing</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;normal or&nbsp;</span><span style="background: yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">inevitable about unending growth</span> on a finite planet. There is nothing normal or inevitable about 10 percent of the world's population holding 85 percent of global household wealth <span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">2 while a billion or two struggle day to day just to survive.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">There is nothing normal</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;or inevitable&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">about</span> knowingly <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">degrading ecosystems</span>, permanently extinguishing entire species<span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, causing irreversible changes in climate, or dislocating millions of people by failing to stop the resultant rise in sea levels. And there is nothing normal or inevitable about justifying all this in the name of "economic growth" or "progress" or "consumer demand" or "efficiency" or "jobs" or "return on investment" or "global competitiveness." So yes, many people in advanced industrial countries are comfortable. They appear unlikely to change until a crisis affects them personally. They have done well by the current structures, economic and political. But just a bit of reflection, a glimmer of foresight, a glance at the biophysical trends, not to mention at financial trends where mounting debt threatens the entire confidence game, and the path's end point is clear: collapse. All the market forces and technological wizardry will not change some basic facts: we have one planet, one set of ecosystems, and one hydrologic cycle; and each of us has just one brain, one body, and one lifetime. Limits are real. If the current system cannot continue on one planet, just as slavery could not continue with trends in democracy and free markets and religious rights and human rights, then the action is with those with a bit of foresight, those with a vision of a different way of living on the planet, of living with nature, not against nature. The action is with those who can accept limits indeed, embrace them.

They are the ones making sure the sand and the sandbags are on hand so that others can pitch in when the time comes.

The&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">others</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, the people who need a crisis to act, are not the leaders.

And now is the time to prepare-not when the crisis hits home and hits hard. So make no mistake, some people will act when there's a crisis. But many others will be getting ready now. These are the concerned and committed, the "moral entrepreneurs" who are already discovering that acting now is very satisfying, very engaging. It's hard, yet at times quite simple.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><h3 id="HAT:CoalDA" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>AT: Coal DA</span></h3><h4 id="HReplacingeverycoalplantisn2019tenoughtosolve2014neitheristheaff." class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Replacing every coal plant isn’t enough to solve—neither is the aff.</span></h4><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">Rapier 12</span>—Chief Technology Officer at Merica International—a Renewable Energy Company, Master’s in Chemical Engineering from Texas AandM University &nbsp;March 15, 2012, Robert Rapier, Study: Eliminating Coal-Fired Power is Worth 0.2 Degrees in 100 Years, http://www.consumerenergyreport.com/2012/03/05/study-eliminating-coal-fired-power-is-worth-0-2-degrees-in-100-years/</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Who could have dreamed solving climate change would be so easy</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">?

He did indeed project short-term warming in that scenario, yet it was a result of the air becoming cleaner and allowing sunlight through as the coal was phased out. Thus, the media really got that story wrong, which was not about a deficiency of natural gas, but rather about the peculiarity of burning coal — that the particulate emissions reflect sunlight. Those who fixated on natural gas as the culprit could have written the same story about solar power — which the study’s author confirmed for me. Hence, I made that my “Bombshell” to illustrate the point.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">However, that particular study didn’t actually model the temperature impact of shutting down coal plants and replacing them with anything other than natural gas.

I am just wondering what the potential actually is. Are we talking about 1 or 2 degrees lower?

Pay particular attention to the temperature scale.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The graphic indicates — as Tom Wigley’s previous paper indicated but which was only reported relative to natural gas — that&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">in every single case, it doesn’t matter what coal-fired power plants are replaced with, the temperature is projected to increase for almost the next 40 years. This is true even in the baseline “Conservation” case,</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;which involves merely idling the coal-fired plants and not replacing them with anything.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The paper projects that if coal-fired power plants continue to operate, the expected temperature rise relative to the baseline</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;(i.e., relative to the expected temperature increase from other sources)&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">in 50 years is 0.15 degrees C, and in 100 years is about 0.33 degrees C</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">If coal is phased out and replaced with natural gas, the relative 50 and 100 year temperature rise is projected to be 0.14 degrees C and 0.24 degrees C, respectively</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">So the paper shows slightly less warming</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;when natural gas is used, which Climate Progress Tweeted as “Switch from coal to natural gas would have zero effect on global temperatures by 2100” and included a link to Joe’s “bombshell.” That is obviously an exaggeration, as the graphic clearly shows that the effect is not zero. If it was, the natural gas line would overlay the coal line.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Shocking Implications</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">One shocking implication from the paper was the projection that hydropower would be worse than coal for the next 60 years. The study’s authors cited methane emissions from organic matter buried under water as the reason for this apparent anomaly. But that’s not the really shocking thing about the study for me.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The most shocking conclusion was the magnitude of the numbers we are talking about.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">Even if you could in theory shut down all of the coal-fired power plants in the world and replace them</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;with wind, solar, and hydropower —&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">in 50 years the projected temperature is only one-twentieth of a degree C cooler than the base case of continuing to use coal</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">. In 100 years, if I could replace all global coal-fired power plants with firm, renewable power — the temperature is only projected to be about 0.2 degrees cooler than under the coal base case</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">. And the way this is being spun is that the 0.09 degree reduction from switching to natural gas is equivalent to an effect of “zero”, but the 0.2 degree reduction in hypothetically replacing everything with wind and solar power 100 years from now is significant</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">. About the natural gas case, Romm literally said the 0.09 degree lower temperature in switching to natural gas means that “natural gas is a bridge fuel to nowhere”, but the 0.2 degree lower temperature in switching to renewables is “the world’s only plausible hope to avert catastrophic temperature rise.”</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Nuclear and Natural Gas to the Rescue — But Most Environmentalists Hate Them</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">A big irony here is that there are only two power sources that are today capable of achieving the study’s conclusion that we must rapidly replace coal-fired power plants: Nuclear power and natural gas.

According to Macintyre,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">'modern societies</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;recognize that acquisitiveness is a character trait indispensable to continuous and limitless economic growth, and on</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">e of their central beliefs is that continuous and limitless economic growth is a fundamental good</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">. That a systematically lower standard of living ought to be preferred to a systematically higher standard of living is a thought incompatible with either the economics or the politics of peculiarly modem societies' (Macintyre, 1988: 112; emphasis added). This is an obvious but nonetheless important point. Namely, that a post-growth economy and society calls for 'non-acquisitive' identities and interests, or at least identities and interests that are not orientated towards orthodox economic growth and associated practices of passive consumerism. Of course there are those for whom economic insecurity is a positive and indeed necessary feature of modern capitalism. Schumpeter, for example, famously noted capitalism's 'creative destruction' by which he meant that, 'This process of Creative Destruction is the essential fact about capitalism. It is what capitalism consists in and what every capitalist concern has got to live in' (Schumpeter, 1975: 82). But as the Foucauldian analysis in the last chapter suggested, this risk-taking is no longer limited to the 'entrepreneur' but is now a feature of every neo-liberal subject in contemporary capitalist societies (Mellor, 2010).&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">For</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;Schumpeter, and indeed other&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">mainstream economists, a key feature of capitalism's productive dynamism is its inherent instability</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Its</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;very&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">capacity to generate insecurity is a way of spurring innovation</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;and entrepreneurialism; all with the aim, of course, of increasing production and consumption, profitability and therefore economic growth. Therefore, arguments for economic security run counter to this vision, both in questioning the means (creative destruction and manufactured and structurally maintained insecurity) and the ends (orthodox economic growth as measured by GDP). However,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">this does not</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;necessarily&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">mean</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;(as critics are wont to point out)&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">that&nbsp;</span><span style="background: yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">a focus on economic security as a main objective</span> of macroeconomic policy <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">means an end to</span> entrepreneurialism or <span style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">innovation</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">.

Irrespective of the particular views of Nature held by different individuals and social groups, consensus has emerged over the seriousness of the environmental condition and the precariousness of our socio-ecological balance (Swyngedouw, forthcoming). BP has rebranded itself as ‘Beyond Petroleum’ to certify its environmental credentials, Shell plays a more eco-sensitive tune, eco-activists of various political or ideological stripes and colours engage in direct action in the name of saving the planet, New Age post-materialists join the chorus that laments the irreversible decline of ecological amenities, eminent scientists enter the public domain to warn of pending ecological catastrophe, politicians try to outmanoeuvre each other in brandishing the ecological banner, and a wide range of policy initiatives and practices, performed under the motif of ‘sustainability’, are discussed, conceived and implemented at all geographical scales. Al Gore’s evangelical film An Inconvenient Truth won him the Nobel Peace price, surely one of the most telling illustrations of how eco - logical matters are elevated to the terrain of a global humanitarian cause (see also Giddens, 2009). While there is certainly no agreement on what exactly Nature is and how to relate to it, there is a virtually unchallenged consensus over the need to be more ‘environmentally’ sustainable if disaster is to be avoided; a climatic sustainability that centres around stabilizing the CO2 content in the atmosphere (Boykoff et al., forthcoming). This consensual framing is itself sustained by a particular scientific discourse.1 The complex translation and articulation between what Bruno Latour (2004) would call matters of fact versus matters of concern has been thoroughly short-circuited. The changing atmospheric composition, marked by increasing levels of CO2 and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, is largely caused by anthropogenic activity, primarily (although not exclusively) as a result of the burning of fossilized or captured CO2 (in the form of oil, gas, coal, wood) and the disappearance of CO2 sinks and their associated capture processes (through deforestation for example).&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">These undisputed matters of fact are, without proper political intermediation, translated into matters of concern</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">.

The discursive matrix through which the contemporary meaning of the environmental condition is woven is one quilted systematically by the continuous invocation of fear and danger, the spectre of ecological annihilation or at least seriously distressed socio-ecological conditions for many people in the near future. ‘</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Fear’ is indeed the crucial node through which much of the current environmental narrative is woven, and continues to feed the concern with ‘sustainability’</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">. This cultivation of ‘ecologies of fear’, in turn, is sustained in part by a particular set of phantasmagorical imaginaries (Katz, 1995).&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The apocalyptic imaginary of a world without water,</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;or at least with endemic water shortages, ravaged by hurricanes whose intensity is amplified by climate change;&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">pictures of scorched land as global warming shifts the</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;geopluvial&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">regime&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">and the spatial variability of droughts and floods; icebergs that disintegrate around the poles as ice melts into the sea, causing the sea level to rise; alarming reductions in biodiversity as species disappear or are threatened by extinction; post-apocalyptic images of waste lands reminiscent of the silent ecologies of the region around Chernobyl; the threat of peak-oil that, without proper management and technologically innovative foresight, would return society to a Stone Age existence; the devastation of wildfires, tsunamis, diseases like SARS, avian flu, Ebola or HIV, all these imaginaries of a Nature out of synch, destabilized, threatening and out ofcontrol are paralleled by equally disturbing images of a society that continues piling up waste, pumping CO2 into the atmosphere, deforesting the earth, etc. This is a process that Neil Smith appropriately refers to as ‘nature-washing’ (2008: 245). In sum,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">our ecological predicament is sutured by millennial fears, sustained by an apocalyptic rhetoric and representational tactics</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, and by a series of performative gestures signalling an overwhelming, mind-boggling danger, one that threatens to undermine the very coordinates of our everyday lives and routines, and may shake up the foundations of all we took and take for granted. Table 1 exemplifies some of the imaginaries that are continuously invoked. Of course, apocalyptic imaginaries have been around for a long time as an integral part of Western thought, first of Christianity and later emerging as the underbelly of fast-forwarding technological modernization and its associated doomsday thinkers. However, present-day millennialism preaches an apocalypse without the promise of redemption. Saint John’s biblical apocalypse, for example, found its redemption in God’s infinite love. The proliferation of modern apocalyptic imaginaries also held up the promise of redemption: the horsemen of the apocalypse, whether riding under the name of the proletariat, technology or capitalism, could be tamed with appropriate political and social revolutions. As Martin Jay argued, while traditional apocalyptic versions still held out the hope for redemption, for a ‘second coming’, for the promise of a ‘new dawn’, environmental apocalyptic imaginaries are ‘leaving behind any hope of rebirth or renewal . . . in favour of an unquenchable fascination with being on the verge of an end that never comes’ (1994: 33). The emergence of newforms of millennialism around the environmental nexus is of a particular kind that promises neither redemption nor realization. As Klaus Scherpe (1987) insists,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">this is not simply apocalypse now, but apocalypse forever</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">It is a vision that does not suggest, prefigure or expect the necessity of an event that will alter history</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">. Derrida (referring to the nuclear threat in the 1980s) sums this up most succinctly: . . . here, precisely, is announced—as promise or as threat—an apocalypse without apocalypse, an apocalypse without vision, without truth, without revelation . . . without message and without destination, without sender and without decidable addressee . . . an apocalypse beyond good and evil. (1992: 66)&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The environmentally apocalyptic future, forever postponed, neither promises redemption nor does it possess a name; it is pure negativity</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">. The attractions of such an apocalyptic imaginary are related to a series of characteristics. In contrast to standard left arguments about the apocalyptic dynamics of unbridled capitalism (Mike Davis is a great exemplar of this; see Davis, 1999, 2002), I would argue that&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">sustaining and nurturing apocalyptic imaginaries is an integral and vital part of the new cultural politics of capitalism</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;(Boltanski and Chiapello, 2007)&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">for which the&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">management of fear is a central leitmotif</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;(Badiou, 2007). At the symbolic level, ap</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">ocalyptic imaginaries are extraordinarily powerful in disavowing or displacing social conflict and antagonisms</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">. As such,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">apocalyptic imaginations</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;are decidedly populist and&nbsp;</span><em><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">foreclose a proper political framing</span></em><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">. Or, in other&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">words, the presentation of&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">climate change as a global humanitarian cause produces a</span> thoroughly <span style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">depoliticized imaginary</span>, one <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">that&nbsp;</span><em><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow">does not revolve around choosing one trajectory rather than another</span></em><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, one that is not articulated with specific political programs or socio-ecological project or revolutions.

These processes, their forms of reason and discourse, can be said to have performed a particular imagination of their public, and encouraged the material enactment of that imagination into society. If we also refer back here to the practices of pollution management at the Windscale-Sellafield site, as reflected in Dunster's 1958 description earlier of how routine marine radioactive discharges were set, we can see in this account, and in the ensuing environmental contamination and human exposures from this, a performance of nuclear technology's imagined publics. We can see from not only the typical symbolism but also in corresponding material practices that as democratic participants, worthy of respectful recognition and to be given standing as part of the moral --community in which nuclear technology exists, effectively there is no public. It has been one of the most significant shifts of collective understanding amongst many - contributed by the late twentieth century social sciences and humanities, that symbolic actions carry corresponding changes in material social relations. Thus the&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">normatively imposed social relations of technoscience here are not just symbolically projected, but also materially performed</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">. In addition to the instances noted above, a further routinized example of the latter was the sustained extreme secrecy and misinformation that was practised by the UK nuclear authorities behind the scenes of this 1956 flood of positive publicity, and in imposed assumptions-in-practice about what people's concerns, needs and capacities are and should be. These were in no need of co ll ective negotiation; they were subsumed into the dominant assumed ontology. Inquiry inspector Mr Justice Parker's later empiricist framing and interpretation of the Windscale inquiry's conflicting ontological commitments, as these were embodied in the irreconcilable arguments of the parties but represented by him as measurable - and measured by him - against an empirically discoverable standard, did the same. Despite all the noise and fury of public debate and controversy, his discrete translations of expressed public concerns into his own terms were not subjected to any direct accountable scrutiny. Of course, his rational arguments in favour of THORP's approval were, but that is not what I am referring to here. This book still stands as a sole, modest and utterly marginal witness to this.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p></div></div></td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>11/10/2012</td><td style="width:100%; word-wrap:break-word;"><div><!--  <input type="image" onclick="deleteEntry('11', 'http://opencaselist.paperlessdebate.com/xwiki/rest/wikis/opencaselist/spaces/Emory/pages/Pesce-Sigalos Neg/objects/Admin.EntryClass/')" value="Delete" title="Delete" style="float:right;" src="/xwiki/resources/icons/silk/cross.gif" />

To the extent that this process gets out of the center's control, certain measures have to be taken to 'suffocate', limit, or curb the 'spread' of these weapons. As concerns the second point, Mutimer (1997:203) points out the peculiar agency implied in the concept: "Notice that&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">the weapons themselves spread</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow">;&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">they are not spread by an external agent&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">of some form - say, a human being or political institution".&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">The fact that a large number of these weapons were actually 'spread' by Western states is&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">consequently&nbsp;</span><strong><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">hidden through this discursive structure</span></strong><span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">. These points are also relevant for the Mediterranean Initiative. We can add a third entailment to the list which appears through a critical reading of the NATO/RAND narrative. As the RAND authors (1998:15) observe, "The mere existence of ballistic missile technology with ranges in excess of 1,000 km on world markets and available to proliferators around the Mediterranean basin would not necessarily pose serious strategic dilemmas for Europe."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">In fact,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">we might even agree with the neorealist proposition that 'more might be better', above all in terms of nuclear weapons.</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;This is certainly the preferred solution of John Mearsheimer (1990) for the stabilization of European political order after the end of the cold war.

A central purpose of the Mediterranean Initiative/Dialogue is to improve 'mutual understanding' and to 'dispel some of the misperceptions and apprehensions that exist, on both sides of the Mediterranean' (Solana, 1997a:5). And both the RAND Corporation and NATO put some emphasis on public information and perception. Yet the structure of this relationship proves to be unbalanced and virtually unilateral. As mentioned above, for NATO, the prime task is above all the "further refinement of its definition of security" (de Santis, 1998). The general identity of the South as a site of danger and insecurity is consequently never in question. Western perceptions are never problematized. Knowledge of the South is, it appears, a matter of matching more and better information with proper conceptual tools.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">On the other hand, (mis)perceptions take the place of knowledge in the South.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">NATO is perceived widely as a Cold War institution searching for a new enemy. That is why the best course to change the perception of NATO in these countries is to focus more on "soft" security, building mutual understanding and confidence before engaging in "hard" military cooperation. Measures should be developed with the aim of promoting transparency and defusing threat perceptions, and promoting a better understanding of NATO's policies and objectives (de Santis, 1998:34).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">To interpret political misgivings about NATO and its post-cold war diplomacy as 'misperceptions' which can be put straight by "educating opinion-makers in the dialogue-countries"(RAND, 1998:75) tends to naturalize and objectify the Western rendition of NATO's identity. The possibility that from the perspective of the 'Southern' countries NATO's political and strategic design might look quite different is lost in this narrative. NATO's identity is decontextualized and objectified, the productive role of different cultural and strategic settings in the establishment of identities and formulation of interests denied. To maintain such a lofty position becomes more difficult if we let the Mediterranean participants voice their concerns openly. Far from being 'misperceptions and misunderstandings', these countries' less than enthusiastic attitudes towards NATO are based on, for instance, the establishment of powerful Western military intervention capabilities off their beaches. Also, NATO's attempts to institutionalize a military cooperation is interpreted as an attempt to gain a strategic foothold in the region in order to monitor the flow of missile technology and the possession of WMD (Selim 1998:12-14). In other words, we encounter rather rational and reasonable security political and strategic concerns.

For while we so far cannot observe any direct military intervention by the Alliance in the Mediterranean region, NATO's discourse on the South in general, and the Initiative in particular render it accessible and available for such action. Strategic knowledge is produced as an expression of, and in anticipation of, strategic power. The 'self-determination' of NATO as a continuously capable and competent military agent is effected through a discourse that inscribes a particular, securitizing, strategic order upon the South, positing it as a site of danger, irrationality and insecurity against the West. In this context it is interesting to observe the exclusion of states from the Mediterranean Initiative that are not considered to be 'moderate, Western-looking and constructivist' (RAND 1998:57). This differentiation between insiders and outsiders appears to be based on the degree to which the respective countries are willing to subject themselves to the imperial encounter with the West, and to open themselves to the strategic gaze and control of NATO.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The imperial encounter is then made possible and supported by what one may call the Emperor's two bodies. On one hand, the West appears as a cultural identity among others, located in space (North of the Mediterranean) and time (in the post-cold war era). In this sense, the West is the entity that needs to be protected from the dangers and threats which 'spill over' from the South through adequate strategic means.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">On the other hand,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background: yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">the West is presented as a 'site of knowledge'</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, as the source or&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">author of the proper and objective 'world-picture' that depicts the realities of&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">post-cold war&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">global politics</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">.

How can we conceptualize this shift to examine what has changed over the past century and what has remained the same in a racist society? Joe Feagin examines this question with a theory of systemic racism to explore societal complexity of interconnected elements for longevity and adaptability of racism. He sees that systemic racism persists due to a “white racial frame,” defining and maintaining an “organized set of racialized ideas, stereotypes, emotions, and inclinations to discriminate” (Feagin 2006: 25).&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The white racial frame arranges the routine operation of racist institutions, which enables social and economic repro-duction and amendment of racial privilege.</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;It is this frame that defines the political and economic bases of cultural and historical legitimization.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">While&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">the white racial frame</span> is one of the components of systemic racism, it <span style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">is attached to other terms of racial oppression</span> to forge systemic coherency.<span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">It has altered over time</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;from slavery to segregation to racial oppression&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">and now frames “culture war,”</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;or “clash of civilizations,”&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">to legitimate the racist oppression of domination, exclusion, war, and genocide.</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The concept of&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">“culture war”</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;emerged to define opposing ideas in America regarding privacy, censorship, citizenship rights, and secularism, but it&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">has</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;been&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">globalized</span> through <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">conflicts over</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;immigration,&nbsp;</span><em><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow">nuclear power</span></em><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">, and the “war on terrorism.”&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Its discourse</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;and action articulate to&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">flood the racial space of systemic racism.</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;Racism is a process of defining and building communities and societies based on racial-ized hierarchy of power. The expansion of capitalism cast new formulas of divisions and oppositions, fostering inequality even while integrating all previous forms of oppressive hierarchical arrangements as long as they bolstered the need to maintain the structure and form of capitalist arrangements (Batur-VanderLippe 1996). In this context, the white racial frame, defining the terms of racist systems of oppression, enabled the globalization of racial space through the articulation of capitalism (Du Bois 1942; Winant 1994). The key to understanding this expansion is comprehension of the synergistic relationship between racist systems of oppression and the capitalist system of exploitation. Taken separately, these two systems would be unable to create such oppression independently. However, the synergy between them is devastating. In the age of industrial capitalism, this synergy manifested itself imperialism and colonialism. In the age of advanced capitalism, it is war and genocide. The capitalist system, by enabling and maintaining the connection between everyday life and the global, buttresses the processes of racial oppression, and synergy between racial oppression and capitalist exploitation begets violence. Etienne Balibar points out that the connection between everyday life and the global is established through thought, making global racism a way of thinking, enabling connections of “words with objects and words with images in order to create concepts” (Balibar 1994: 200). Yet, global racism is not only an articulation of thought, but also a way of knowing and acting, framed by both everyday and global experiences. Synergy between capitalism and racism as systems of oppression enables this perpetuation and destruction on the global level. As capitalism expanded and adapted to the particularities of spatial and temporal variables, global racism became part of its legitimization and accommodation, first in terms of colonialist arrangements.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">In colonized and colonizing lands, global racism has been perpetuated through racial ideologies and discriminatory practices</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;under capitalism&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">by the creation and recreation of connections among memory, knowledge, institutions, and construction of the future in thought and action. What makes racism global are the bridges connecting the particularities of everyday racist experiences to the universality of racist concepts and actions, maintained globally by myriad forms of prejudice, discrimination, and violence</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;(Balibar and Wallerstein 1991; Batur 1999, 2006). Under colonialism, colonizing and colonized societies were antagonistic opposites.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Since colonizing society portrayed the colonized “other,” as the adversary and challenger of the “the ideal self,” not only identification but also segregation and containment were essential to racist policies.</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The terms of exclusion were set by the institutions that fostered and maintained segregation, but the intensity of exclusion, and redundancy, became more apparent</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;in the age of advanced capitalism,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">as an extension of post-colonial discipline.

The “geography of hunger” marks the context and space in which oppression and exploitation continue. The historical maps drawn by colonialism now demarcate the boundaries of post-colonial arrangements. The white racial frame restructures this space to fit the imagery of symbolic racism, modifying it to fit the television screen, or making the evidence of the necessity of the politics of exclusion, and the violence of war and genocide, palatable enough for the front page of newspapers, spread out next to the morning breakfast cereal. Two examples of this “geography of hunger and exploitation” are Iraq and New Orleans.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><h4 id="HTheaff2019sfantasyofcontrolwillonlyproducea201Cnever-endingwar201Dforsecurity2014blowbackensureseffortstocreateorderoutofdisorderwillfail." class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>The aff’s fantasy of control will only produce a “never-ending war” for security—blowback ensures efforts to create order out of disorder will fail.</span></h4><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">Ritchie 11</span>—Nick, PhD, Research Fellow at the Department of Peace Studies @ University of Bradford, Executive Committee of the British Pugwash Group and the Board of the Nuclear Information Service “Rethinking security: a critical analysis of the Strategic Defence and Security Review” International Affairs Volume 87, Issue 2, Article first published online: 17 MAR 2011</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Third,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the legitimating narrative of acting as a ‘force for good’ that emerged</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;in the 1998 SDR&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">to justify an expensive, expeditionary, war-fighting military doctrine in the name of ‘enlightened self-interest’ must be scrutinized</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">.

Indeed, the Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty’s 2001 ‘responsibility to protect’ doctrine sets out clearly the principle of conditional sovereignty and the grounds for legitimate intervention when a state cannot or will not protect its citizens from pervasive and severe harm. 94 More broadly, if we accept that in an increasingly complex, interdependent world the human security of UK citizens enmeshed in global networks of risk and opportunity is intertwined with the human security of others, particularly in conflict-prone regions often characterized by poverty, weak governance and underdevelopment, then actions to improve others’ long-term human security does constitute a form of ‘enlightened self-interest’. But we must question the assumption that war-fighting interventionist missions of choice do, in fact, serve the long-term human security interests of UK citizens as opposed to the interests of the state based on prevailing conceptions of national role. Utility of force Connected to this critique is a reappraisal of the utility of force within the conception of national security as global risk management, on two counts. First, security risks are increasingly likely to arise from a complex mixture of interdependent factors. Environmental, economic, military and political sources of insecurity could include the effects of climate change, mass poverty and economic injustice, global pandemic disease, mass migration and refugee flows, poor governance, weak and failing states, international terrorism and asymmetric warfare, the spread of WMD and advanced conventional military technologies, ethnic and sectarian nationalism, and competition over access to key resources such as oil and water. Future conflicts are therefore likely to be complex and diverse. They are unlikely to be susceptible to purely military solutions, and the use of military force in regional crises will be messy, indeterminate and of limited value and effectiveness. 95 It is not obvious that the armed forces have a significant war-fighting role to play in mitigating these risks, as opposed to supporting police, intelligence and security forces in countering terrorist plots—and possibly launching a limited, precision strike against WMD capabilities in the event of the extreme scenario of robust intelligence that a WMD attack is imminent. In fact, the 2009 National Security Strategy limited the role of the armed forces to ‘defence against direct threats to the UK and its overseas territories’ (which one could qualify as ‘direct violent, or military, threats’) together with a contributory role in ‘tackling threats to our security overseas by helping to address conflict, instability and crises across the globe’. 96 This broad but essentially supportive remit for the military was reinforced in the 2010 National Security Strategy’s catalogue of priority risks. The three-tiered list enumerated 15 risks, which can be reduced to five: terrorism, civil emergencies, international crime, trade disputes and an attack by another state. 97 The role of military force is limited in all of these except the last, which remains by far the least likely. As Jenkins argues, almost none of the above is a threat. They are crimes, catastrophes, or, in the case of being ‘drawn in’ to a foreign conflict, a matter of political choice … as for the threat of conventional attack on the British Isles by another state, we can only ask who? The threat is so negligible as to be insignificant. It is like insuring one’s house for billions of pounds against an asteroid attack. 98 Bob Ainsworth, then Defence Secretary, seemed to grasp this in 2009, arguing that ‘our initial conclusions on the character of warfare should be first that international intervention will be more difficult not less. We will have to consider carefully how to apply military force in pursuit of national security. And second, and related to this, that the timely application of soft power and methods of conflict prevention will be a high priority.’ 99 Yet the government also insists on maintaining an interventionist, expeditionary military doctrine and corresponding capabilities based on a seemingly unquestioned national security role as a ‘force for good’ in global risk management operations.

Writing after the 1991 Gulf War, Edward Said notes the US hesitance to use the word ‘empire’ despite its long imperial history.2 This hesitance too is increasingly under attack as even self-designated liberal commentators such as Michael Ignatieff urge the US to overcome its unease with the ‘e-word’ and selfconsciously don the mantle of imperial power, contravening the limits of sovereign authority and remaking the world in its universalist image of ‘democracy’ and ‘freedom’.3 Rashid Khalidi has argued that the US invasion and occupation of Iraq does indeed mark a new stage in American world hegemony, replacing the indirect and proxy forms of Cold War domination with a regime much more reminiscent of European colonial empires in the Middle East.4&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">The ease with which a defence of empire has been mounted</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;and a colonial project so unabashedly resurrected&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">makes this a</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;particularly opportune, if not&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;

What Edward Said has to offer IR scholars, I believe, is a certain kind of global sensibility, a critical but sympathetic and felt awareness of an inhabited and cohabited world. Furthermore, it is a profoundly political sensibility whose globalism is predicated on a cognisance of the imperial and a firm non-imperial ethic in its formulation. I make this argument by travelling through a couple of Said’s thematic foci in his enormous corpus of writing. Using a lot of Said’s reflections on the role of public intellectuals, I argue in this article that&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">IR scholars need to develop</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;what I call&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">a ‘global intellectual posture’</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">. In the 1993 Reith Lectures delivered on BBC channels, Said outlines three positions for public intellectuals to assume – as an outsider/exile/marginal, as an ‘amateur’, and&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">as a disturber of the status quo</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;speaking ‘truth to power’ and&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">self-consciously&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">siding with those who are underrepresented</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;and disadvantaged.9 Beginning with a discussion of Said’s critique of ‘professionalism’ and the ‘cult of expertise’ as it applies to International Relations, I first argue the importance, for scholars of global politics, of taking <em>politics&nbsp;</em>seriously. Second, I turn to Said’s comments on the posture of exile and his critique of identity politics, particularly in its nationalist formulations, to ask what it means for students of global politics to take the <em>global&nbsp;</em>seriously. Finally, I attend to some of Said’s comments on humanism and contrapuntality to examine what IR scholars can learn from Said about <em>feeling and thinking globally&nbsp;</em>concretely, thoroughly and carefully.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">IR Professionals in an Age of Empire: From ‘International Experts’ to ‘Global Public Intellectuals’</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">One of the profound effects of the war on terror initiated by the Bush administration has been&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">a</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;significant&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">constriction of a</span> democratic <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">public sphere</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, which&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">has included the</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;active and aggressive&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">curtailment of intellectual</span> and political <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">dissent</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;and a sharp delineation of national boundaries along with concentration of state power.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">The academy</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;in this context&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background: yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">has become a</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;particularly&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">embattled site</span> with<span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;some highly disturbing onslaughts on academic freedom.

Edward Said has written extensively on the place of the academy as one of the few and increasingly precarious spaces for democratic deliberation and argued the necessity for public intellectuals immured from the seductions of power.14 Defending the US academy as one of the last remaining utopian spaces, ‘the one public space available to real alternative intellectual practices: no other institution like it on such a scale exists anywhere else in the world today’15, and lauding the remarkable critical theoretical and historical work of many academic intellectuals in a lot of his work, Said also complains that ‘the American University, with its munificence, utopian sanctuary, and remarkable diversity, has defanged (intellectuals)’16.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The most serious threat to the ‘intellectual vocation’</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, he argues,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">is&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">‘professionalism’ and mounts a pointed attack on the proliferation of ‘specializations’ and&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">the ‘cult of expertise’ with their focus on</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;‘relatively&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow">narrow areas of knowledge’, ‘technical formalism’, ‘impersonal</span> theories and <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">methodologies’</span>, and<span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;most worrisome of all, their ability and&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">willingness to be&nbsp;</span><em><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow">seduced by power</span></em><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">.17 Said mentions in this context the funding of academic programmes and research which came out of the exigencies of the Cold War18, an area in which there was considerable traffic of political scientists (largely trained as IR and comparative politics scholars) with institutions of policy-making. Looking at various influential US academics as ‘organic intellectuals’ involved in a dialectical relationship with foreign policy-makers and examining the institutional relationships at and among numerous think tanks and universities that create convergent perspectives and interests, Christopher Clement has studied US intervention in the Third World both during and after the Cold War made possible and justified through various forms of ‘intellectual articulation’.19&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background: yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">This is</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;not simply a matter of scholars working for the state, but&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">indeed&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background: yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">a</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;larger&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">question of&nbsp;</span><em><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">intellectual orientation</span></em><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">It is not uncommon for IR scholars to feel the need to formulate their&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">scholarly&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">conclusions&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">in terms of its relevance for global politics, where ‘relevance’ is measured&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">entirely in terms of policy wisdom</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">.

These processes, their forms of reason and discourse, can be said to have performed a particular imagination of their public, and encouraged the material enactment of that imagination into society. If we also refer back here to the practices of pollution management at the Windscale-Sellafield site, as reflected in Dunster's 1958 description earlier of how routine marine radioactive discharges were set, we can see in this account, and in the ensuing environmental contamination and human exposures from this, a performance of nuclear technology's imagined publics. We can see from not only the typical symbolism but also in corresponding material practices that as democratic participants, worthy of respectful recognition and to be given standing as part of the moral --community in which nuclear technology exists, effectively there is no public. It has been one of the most significant shifts of collective understanding amongst many - contributed by the late twentieth century social sciences and humanities, that symbolic actions carry corresponding changes in material social relations. Thus the&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">normatively imposed social relations of technoscience here are not just symbolically projected, but also materially performed</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">. In addition to the instances noted above, a further routinized example of the latter was the sustained extreme secrecy and misinformation that was practised by the UK nuclear authorities behind the scenes of this 1956 flood of positive publicity, and in imposed assumptions-in-practice about what people's concerns, needs and capacities are and should be. These were in no need of co ll ective negotiation; they were subsumed into the dominant assumed ontology. Inquiry inspector Mr Justice Parker's later empiricist framing and interpretation of the Windscale inquiry's conflicting ontological commitments, as these were embodied in the irreconcilable arguments of the parties but represented by him as measurable - and measured by him - against an empirically discoverable standard, did the same. Despite all the noise and fury of public debate and controversy, his discrete translations of expressed public concerns into his own terms were not subjected to any direct accountable scrutiny. Of course, his rational arguments in favour of THORP's approval were, but that is not what I am referring to here. This book still stands as a sole, modest and utterly marginal witness to this.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><h4 id="HThecritiqueisprior2014proliferationdiscourseundercutsaffsolvencybyprioritizingsupply-sidesolutionsattheexpenseofaddressinglegitimatedemand-sideconcerns." class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>The critique is prior—proliferation discourse undercuts aff solvency by prioritizing supply-side solutions at the expense of addressing legitimate demand-side concerns.</span></h4><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">Mutimer 94</span>—David Mutimer is Deputy Director of YCISS and Associate Professor of Political Science at York University August 1994, “Reimagining Security: The Metaphors of Proliferation,” Centre for International and Strategic Studies, York University, http://pi.library.yorku.ca/dspace/bitstream/handle/10315/1415/YCI0074.pdf?sequence=1</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The Assembled Image</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The image of&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">PROLIFERATION knits together the metaphors of</span> 'proliferation', <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow">'stability' and 'balance' to shape</span> the <span style="background: yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">policy</span> responses of the international community. <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">The metaphors</span> have certain entailments, which serve to <span style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">highlight</span>, downplay <span style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">and hide aspects of</span> the <span style="background: yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">security</span> environment.

The second example is of the links being drawn in the Middle East between Arab states' potential chemical arms, and Israel's nuclear arsenal. The Arab states are balking at ratifying the CWC until the Israeli nuclear arms are at least placed on the negotiating table.

This view is reflected in the following passage, quoted from a paper by the Indian Ambassador to Japan, who was previously the Indian representative on the Conference on Disarmament:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.3in;margin-bottom:0in; margin-left:.4in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">It would be futile to pretend that 1995 is 1970, that nothing has changed and nothing requires to be changed in the 1995 NPT. It would be a cruel joke on the coming generation to say that they will be safer with an indefinite extension of the 1970 NPT. 1995 presents an opportunity; there is great scope for non governmental agencies, intellectuals and academics, who believe in nuclear disarmament to work towards changing this mindset and spur governments in nuclear weapon countries to look at reality, to accept that there are shortcomings in the NPT and that nations, both within and outside the NPT have genuine concerns which need to be addressed in order to make the NPT universal, non discriminatory and a true instrument for nuclear disarmament. Emphasis added.66</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">There are three noteworthy elements of this plea for change. The first is that Ambassador&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Shah recognises the importance of changing the mindset toward the problem in order to effect change in the policy responses to that problem</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">. This feature of his remarks relates to the second. Ambassador Shah casts&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">his justification for alterations in the NPT</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;as&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">reflect</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">ing&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">a changed reality—thereby attacking the naturalisation of the features of the world which are highlighted by the PROLIFERATION image, as reflected in the NPT.</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;Finally, Ambassador Shah calls for the new NPT to be an instrument of 'nuclear disarmament', not non-proliferation. In other words, he recognises that&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">there is a policy problem to be addressed, but it is not a PROLIFERATION problem</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">—that is, a spread of weapons technology from those who have to those who do not presently have.

The NPT is seen as the linchpin of the proliferation control effort, without which the entire edifice might fall. What Ambassador Shah's comments demonstrate, reflecting the position taken in India, is the way in which&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">that effort, tied so closely to the entailments of the PROLIFERATION image,&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">serves</span> only <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">a particular set of interests by highlighting</span> only <span style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">specific features of 'reality'</span>.<span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;From where he sits, 'reality' provides Ambassador Shah with a different approach to the problem of nuclear (and other mass destruction) weapons, an approach better captured through an image of (DIS)ARMAMENT than one of PROLIFERATION.</span></p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h3 id="H2NC2014SPFKPrior" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>2NC—SPF K Prior</span></h3><h4 id="HProliferationdiscoursespursineffectivepolicies2014focusonmotivesandactors2Cnotonweapons." class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Proliferation discourse spurs ineffective policies—focus on motives and actors, not on weapons.</span></h4><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">Mutimer 94</span>—David Mutimer is Deputy Director of YCISS and Associate Professor of Political Science at York University August 1994, “Reimagining Security: The Metaphors of Proliferation,” Centre for International and Strategic Studies, York University, http://pi.library.yorku.ca/dspace/bitstream/handle/10315/1415/YCI0074.pdf?sequence=1</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">'Proliferation'</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;in its base biological meaning then,&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">refers to an autonomous process of</span> growth and <span style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">outward spread, internally driven but externally controlled</span>.<span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;Danger arises when the controls fail and the natural proliferation of cells produces excessive reproduction.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The first step of the adoption of 'proliferation' as a metaphor for international security involved applying the term to the development of&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">nuclear technology</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;after the discovery of controlled fission in the United States' Manhattan Project.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The U</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">nited&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">S</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">tates'&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">nuclear programme represented the source 'cell'</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;or 'organism'&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">from which the technology&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">would spread.

The first question to be asked is what are the implications of this image, with its understandings of autonomy, spread and external control, for the policy response to the development of nuclear technology?&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">There are two</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;crucial&nbsp;</span><span style="background: yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">entailments of the proliferation metaphor</span> as applied to nuclear weapons<span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">The first</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;entailment&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">is the image of a spread outward from a</span> point, or <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">source</span>.

For example, former Prime Minster Trudeau proposed a scheme to the United Nations Special Session on Disarmament for preventing weapons' spread. This scheme included two measures currently under consideration at the Conference on Disarmament, a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and a Cutoff of Fissile Material Production. Trudeau's plan was known as the 'suffocation proposal'—firmly in keeping with the biological referent of proliferation.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">To stop, rather than control, reproduction by organisms, you need to 'suffocate' the progenitors</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">The second entailment</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;of the 'proliferation' metaphor for the problem of nuclear weapons spread&nbsp;</span><span style="background: yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">is a</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">n extreme&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">technological bias</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">. Biological proliferation is an internally driven phenomenon, and so&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">the image of 'Proliferation'</span> applied to the development of nuclear technology <span style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">highlights the autonomous spread of</span> that <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">technology</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, and its problematic weapons variant. As Frank Barnaby writes in a recent work, "A country with a nuclear power programme will inevitably acquire the technical knowledge and expertise, and will accumulate the fissile material necessary to produce nuclear weapons."50 In fact, the text from which this is drawn presents an interesting example of the autonomy of the 'proliferation' metaphor. The book is entitled How Nuclear Weapons Spread: Nuclear-weapon proliferation in the 1990s. Notice that&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">the weapons themselves spread, they are not spread by an external agent</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;of some form—say a human being or human institution</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">. Under most circumstances such a title would be unnoticed, for as Lakoff and Johnson argue, the metaphors are so deeply engrained in our conceptual system that they are not recognised as being metaphorical.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">This image</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, by highlighting the technological and autonomous aspects of a process of spread,&nbsp;</span><em><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">downplays or even&nbsp;</span></em><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11pt; background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow">hides</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;important aspects of&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">the relationship of nuclear weapons to</span> international <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">security</span>.<span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;To begin with,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">the image hides the fact that nuclear weapons do not spread, but are spread</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">—and in fact are spread largely&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">by</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;the&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow">western states</span>.

This can he grasped through the concept of poli1y stories.

This perspective thus subjects the factual dimensions of political processes to the interests and normative commitments of actors, in the sense that knowledge is used to justify and legitimize calls for adopting certain policies to resolve what is seen to be a problem that 'ought' to be resolved. The formulation is partly inspired by Rein and Schuss (1991. 265), who refer to&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">problem-setting&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">stories</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;that&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">'link</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;causal accounts of&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">policy problems to</span> particular <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">proposals</span> for action <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">and facilitate the normative leap from "is" to 'ought</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">"'. We depart from Rein and Schon's conception somewhat by emphasizing more strongly the factual claims (the characteristics of a phenomenon and normative principles (the morally' grounded principles used to legitimize the policy formulation invoked by actors as they define a problem and argue for a specific policy approach. The concept of policy stories seeks to capture how actors integrate knowledge claims into their politically charged arguments so as to 'frame' the issue under discussion. Because of the interlocking of the factual and normative dimension of policy making, a policy story, can be seen to create space for political agency. That is: a policy story serves by creating an argument grounded in a body of scientifically produced knowledge, to persuade and mobilize different groups as it represents a complete package: an authoritative problem-definition and a concomitant policy solution that is legitimized in both factual and normative terms.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background: yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">A policy</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;story-&nbsp;</span><span style="background: yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">that&nbsp;</span><em><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">wins acceptance at the discursive level</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;can be seen to&nbsp;</span><em><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt; background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">define the terms of the debate</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">&nbsp;for the establishment of policy and</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;to&nbsp;</span><em><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow">de- legitimize competing</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">&nbsp;conceptualizations and&nbsp;</span><em><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow">policy approaches</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">.

In this way, the policy story' may over time attain a 'taken for granted' char- acter as it comes to structure, and reflect, policy practice. This process of stabilization is best described as a process of institutionalization. Following Scott, we can define institutionalization as a 'process by which a given set of units and a pattern of activities come so be normatively' and cognitively held in place, and practically taken for granted as lawful' Scott at al. 1994: 10). This latter feature is critical to the argument presented here. In the change from an argument for a specific policy approach to the establishment of that policy in practice, the policy story comes to define the cognitive-normative outlook of a policy regime. This can he defined as an interlock between the knowledge which underwrites the policy story, and the establishment in practice of the policy advocated in a policy story: That is:&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background: yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">the&nbsp;</span><em><span style="font-size:12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">knowledge that</span></em><em><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;once&nbsp;</span></em><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11pt; background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow">formed part of an argument for a policy&nbsp;</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">is</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;now&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">an&nbsp;</span><em><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow">integral part&nbsp;</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">of the</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;very rationality and identity' of&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">organization involved with managing this&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">policy</span> <span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">in practice.

Thus it should come as no surprise that, even in this era of globalization, many non-Western states are ambivalent, antagonistic or resistant to 'global' norms. Nor should it be too surprising that Western arms control, non-proliferation and confidence-building processes or concepts have not necessarily taken root when they have been exported to different regional contexts, or to more multilateral forums.

But invariably after the complaint is lodged there is the requisite back and forth and congressional hearings and blue-ribbon panels, and the bomb boosters win. Write another check and we will fix whatever needs fixing, say the custodians-stockpile stewardship miraculously costs more than the nuclear budget in the days of production and testing-and so the cycle continues.

Butler describes the mind-numbing nuclear business and the unfortunate prolongation of Cold War policies, yet he intentionally avoids condemning anyone, an unfortunate oversight. As principal overseer of the nuclear establishment for many years, he says he fought against the Cold War nuclear mindset, and even ended some careers prematurely. But who are the faceless and too-powerful covert decision-makers who have outlived the general and continue to nurture and safeguard their blessed weapon? Isn't it time to ask who agitates against nuclear disarmament? The way things really work is that lab scientists, defense program bureaucrats, science advisers to the commanders of the unified commands, and nuclear specialists on military staffs manufacture "needs" and develop nuclear "requirements." One may hail their Cold War devotion and commitment on behalf of the bomb, but the unfortunate legacy is an enduring process by which nuclear requirements persist due to inertia. It is bottom-up rather than top-down policy. In choosing not to criticize the nuclear establishment, Butler allows these pro-nuclear forces to hide behind service, hardly ever facing up to their spellbound dedication to the bomb, never having to acknowledge their corrosive role in ultimately undermining the universal task-which is bringing the bomb under control. Organically withering The assumption was once that weapons modernization was an automatic process. The labs would by necessity get the money to build new warheads to replace outmoded ones; the next model of missile or bomber would certainly be developed to supplant the obsolete. But now that the political situation has changed, no one officially wants any complications or problems associated with anything that smacks of nuclear weapons being "new" or "modernized" or "improved." Absent a frank statement of the permanence of nuclear weapons that is fundamental to current U.S. policy, the real intentions remain opaque. Decisions are masked by stewardship and talk of "hedges" and "contingencies." Nuclear disarmament is thwarted by "supreme national interest" escape clauses that, in the end, connote continued utility for nuclear weapons. And the bomb wins. It is no wonder that the fight over the nuclear future is again becoming ferocious. The believers pounce on the weaknesses of the White House and attempt to turn the nuclear debate into a partisan battle. Unlike the Democrats, they say with scorn, Republicans are not about to leave the nation vulnerable by engaging in nuclear disarmament. What is most striking about the four-score list of retired generals and admirals who joined Butler and retired Gen. Andrew J. Goodpaster in calling for a renewed commitment to eliminate nuclear weapons is not the weight of the names but the absence of the two most prominent military officers in American society: Gens. Colin Powell and Norman Schwarzkopf. The bomb evidently still has plenty of friends. When writing of the pro-nuclear constituency, a tone of ridicule comes easily. I could describe the kookier efforts of nuclear scientists and apparatchiks-from neutron bombs to mini-nukes. I could make fun of the vocabulary, from mushroom clouds, to Davy Crocketts, red beards, broken arrows, and peacekeepers. I could recount the dark side-the tests at Bikini, the human radiation experiments, Silkwood, Thule, Palomares, Rocky Flats. This is a history and geography that makes the nuclear elite wince. While ridicule is great for sound bites, it alienates not just the custodians but the arms control community as well.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">arms controllers are hampered by their own</span> Cold War <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">history, when they pushed for incremental change</span> to lessen the danger of global nuclear war, always <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">mindful not to challenge</span> the fundamental existence of <span style="background: yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">nuclear weapons</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">.

As the weapons declined in number, in the extent of deployment, and in prominence, they lost that very intrusive quality.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Nuclear weapons are intrinsically colossal in their demands. In the nuclear realm, minimum anything is not possible, while the state of nuclear dominance is unacceptable</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">. As the Cold War struggled through its final decade, the arms control establishment gained the grudging acquiescence of nuclear advocates, men and women who have always known that nuclear weapons can only survive if they are relatively invisible. Get nuclear weapons off the front pages, whether through secrecy or arms control treaties-that was the way to keep control of the machine and to insure modernization and advance. But that was yesterday. Today nuclear weapons are virtually invisible. So much so that ordinary people just don't pay any attention to them anymore. In fact, all of the evidence points to the undeniable conclusion that the nuclear era is over and nuclear weapons are organically withering on the vine. But we'd never know it. A governmental commitment to nuclear disarmament would be irrelevant, of course, if the nuclear weapons enterprise were satisfied to completely wither away. But it isn't. And so on top of the we-need-nukes-because-nukes-exist conundrum, there is the self-interest of organizations and industries wedded to the bomb. Any commitment to abolition is rejected on the basis of technical impossibility. Which is to say that the very scientists and engineers who constructed and controlled tens of thousands of warheads for 50 years seemingly cannot put their minds to undoing it all. Their modesty is increasingly transparent. Yet this cycle will not be broken solely through caution and a Butler-esque professional courtesy that avoids naming names, a politeness that never condemns the anti-disarmament forces that still grind away just as vigorously as Butler did when he worked his way up in the nuclear enterprise.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">Nuclear disarmament will not occur</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;just&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">because</span> well-meaning <span style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">scientists</span>, bureaucrats and military officers <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">chip away at the</span> grotesque <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">arithmetic, "revise" the war plan to make it more humane</span>, repair the most egregious excesses<span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">. Butler is dead-on, of course, in saying that a real commitment to the ultimate goal of nuclear disarmament is essential. But while he came out of the trance and is now speaking up, his failure to point fingers does not really explain the dynamics of the final battle. The anonymity of the problem he describes is completely at odds with the gravity of the issues he says are at stake. Little noticed during the Christmas season was the response of Gen. Eugene Habiger, the current head of U.S. Strategic Command, to the generals' and admirals' initiative. Calling the weapons a "viable part" of U.S. national security strategy, Habiger told Defense Daily that he would undertake a spread-the-message strategy, personally visiting members of Congress one-on-one to promote his product. "I will tell them that we've got a sharp team of superstars and that we are committed to making sure our national strategy of deterrence is viable and credible," he said. "I hope eventually we come to zero nuclear weapons, but we need to do it in a prudent manner so that we don't compromise national security," he continued. "We can't afford another Pearl Harbor-with nuclear weapons." Habiger's justification for the bomb should remind everyone that Butler and his colleagues are the exception and not the rule.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">The bomb survives all attempts to dominate it.

By contrast, wealth (in income, power or education) can purchase safety and freedom from risk.”23 Thus when we endorse a risk-free ethics, we should bear in mind that members of social groups with less to lose and more to gain are more likely to engage in risky behaviors than are members of more secure and privileged social groups. Moreover, as Mary Douglas has argued at length, risk is a forensic resource and, much like the “</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">danger</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">” she elaborated in her early work,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">functions as a means of social control</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">. “Anthropologists would generally agree,” she writes, “that dangers to the body, dangers to children,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">dangers&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">to nature&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">are available as so many weapons to use in the struggle for ideological domination.</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">”24&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">These weapons are sharpened</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, she argues,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">by Western societies’ association of risk assessment with scientific neutrality.</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;Along similar lines, Nick Fox contends that “</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">risk analysis is a</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;deeply&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">political activity</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt; background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">The</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;identification of hazards</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;(and the consequent&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">definition of what is a risk</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow">)&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">can</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;easily&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">lead to</span> “the valorization of certain kinds of living over others.”<span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">25 The&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background: yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">identification of “risk groups” deemed</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;to be&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">threatening</span> to the social order<span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">—the unemployed, criminal, insane, poor, foreign—are a common technology for establishing boundaries between self and other, the normal and the pathological, that&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">is, for securing that “formidable battery of distinctions</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">” Said analyzes between “</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">ours and theirs, proper and improper,” higher and lower, colonial and native,</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Western and Eastern</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">.26 In a fascinating article on debates over native title in Australia, Eva Mackey demonstrates both the way in which&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">political actors deploy a rhetoric of risk</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, danger, and threat&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">and the uses of risk management to imperial hegemony</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">. Not only have newspaper headlines “presented native title as an issue that has brought the nation to the brink of a dangerous abyss, to the point of destruction,” but the Howard government “constructs native title as a danger and risk to the ‘national interest,’ particularly a risk to competitiveness, opportunities, and progress. The entire anti-native title lobby have all stated . . . that the uncertainty over native title is dangerous for investment and economic competitiveness.”27 As Mackey points out, these notions of danger imply “a normative, non-endangered state,” and it is through ideas of the normal and deviant that institutional power is maintained.28 A related argument articulated by governmentality theorists is that modern societies normalize risk avoidance and pathologize risk taking, represent the former as rational and mature, the latter as irrational and childish— oppositions that, again, are familiar to any student of colonial discourse.29 These oppositions are buttressed by&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">an elaborate apparatus of&nbsp;</span><span style="background: yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">expert knowledge</span> produced by disciplines such as engineering, statistics, actuarialism, psychology, epidemiology, and economics, which <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">attempt to regulate risk through calculations of probability</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;and which view the social body as “requiring intervention, management and protection so as to maximize wealth, welfare and productivity.”30 Knowledge produced about probability is then deployed as counsel to individuals about how to conduct their lives. As Lupton contends: “In late modern societies, not to engage in risk avoiding behavior is considered ‘a failure of the self to take care of itself—a form of irrationality, or simply a lack of skillfulness’ (Greco 1993).&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Risk-avoiding behavior, therefore, becomes viewed as a moral enterprise relating to issues of self-control, self-knowledge and self-improvement</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">.”31&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">This is a characteristic of neoliberal societies&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">that Pat O’Malley, Franc¸ois Ewald, and others refer to as the “</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">new prudentialism</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">.”32 To recognize that risk is a form of social control, and that risk taking is more necessary to certain classes than to others, is also to recognize that risk is not an objective entity or preexisting fact but is produced by specific cultural, political, and institutional contexts, as well as through competing knowledges. “To call something a risk,” argues Douglas, “is to recognize its importance to our subjectivity and wellbeing.” 33 Anthony Giddens, similarly, contends that “</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">there is no risk which can be described without reference to a value</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">.”34 In a frequently cited passage, Ewald writes, “</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Nothing is a risk in itself; there is no risk in reality</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">. But on the other hand,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">anything can be a risk; it all depends on how one analyses the danger, considers the event.</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">”35 Indeed, this is precisely&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the unconscious of risk-management technologies,</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;which&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">assume both that risks are preexistent in nature and that individuals comport themselves in strict accordance with a</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;“hedonic&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">calculus</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">.” 5 3 1 Also embedded within this insurantial unconscious is the fact that, as Fox puts it, “The welladvertised risk will turn out to be connected with legitimating moral principles.”36 If postcolonial studies, as I am arguing, should more rigorously interrogate risk-avoidance strategies (including those that repress or discipline the foreignness in language) on their political, class, and ideological investments, it should also recognize the degree to which&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">risk management</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;(no doubt among modernity’s most wildly optimistic formulations</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">)&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">indulges in a fantasy of mastery over uncertainty</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">. In risk-management discourses, risk has taken on the technical meaning of a known or knowable probability estimate, contrasted with uncertainty, which designates conditions where probabilities are inestimable or unknown.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">This transformation of the unknown into a numerical figure, a quantification of nonknowledge</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;that takes itself for knowledge,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">attempts to master whatever might be undesirable in the unknown</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;(i.e., the future) by indemnifying it in advance—and thereby advertising its own failure. I believe it could be demonstrated, moreover, were we to trace the genealogy of this fantasy, that it coincides at crucial moments with the history of colonization. The notion of risk, first used in relation to maritime adventures, arises contemporaneously with modern imperialism, to describe the hazards of leaving home. With industrial modernity, and particularly the rise of the science of statistics in the nineteenth century, it took on themien of instrumental reason and the domination of nature, nuances that bear an unmistakable resemblance to the logics of concurrent colonial enterprises.37 This fantasy of mastery is also a suppression of possibility; in most instances,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">risk avoidance is&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">an (implicit or explicit)&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">maintenance of dominant values. Risk taking, by contrast, is the condition of possibility of possibility— that is, of change</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">. It is perhaps no surprise that&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">one’s political position is the strongest predictor of his/her attitude toward risk.&nbsp;</span><span style="background: yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">Risk</span>,<span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;as we have&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">seen,&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">is</span> regularly <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">formulated as that which threatens the dominant order</span> (conceived on the level of a society, a colonial regime, or a global economic order)<span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">That threat</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, of course,&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">is the “danger” of transformation, of</span> reorganized social and ideological <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">hierarchies</span>, redistributed economic and cultural capital, renovated geopolitical relations—in short, precisely the kinds of transformation called for<span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;by much of postcolonial studies. Risk, including the risk of errors in meaning, may be necessary to any social change, that is, to engaging in the kind of oppositional criticism Said advocates: “</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Criticism must think of itself,</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">” he writes, “as&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">constitutively opposed to every form of tyranny, domination, and abuse</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">.”38 The necessity of risk to change (and the craven conformism of risk avoidance) is a principle Friedrich Nietzsche elaborates in Beyond Good and Evil, where, critiquing the “timidity of morality,” he calls for a new species of philosophers, willing to risk untruth, uncertainty, even ignorance, thinkers willing to inhabit “the dangerous maybe.”39 Nietzsche was also prescient in recognizing that “howmuch or how little is dangerous to the community . . . now constitutes the moral perspective; here, too, fear is again themother ofmorals.”40 More recently, philosophers such as Derrida and John D. Caputo (explicitly taking up Nietzsche’s vocation) have argued that change, indeed social responsibility itself, inevitably demands a wager on uncertain possibilities (or, in Derridean terms, the “aporia”). “Let us not be blind,” writes Derrida, “to the aporia that all change must endure.

Below we review relevant research on why people support war and other military engagements. Our review is broad, but it focuses most of al;l on the roles of “fear and loathing,” perceptions of threat, and inter-group prejudice on support for military action.

For instance, “Integrated Threat Theory” (Stephan and Stephan 2000) and “Social Identity Theory” (Tajfel 1981; Tajfel and Turner 1986) both predict that feeling threatened by some out-group leads individuals to have heightened levels of out-group hostility&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">and to support (or engage in) conflict</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;with that out-group. For example, Oswald found a positive association between feelings of threat and anti-Arab hostility (2005). In that study, perceptions of threat were tapped using a five-item scale that measured participants’ sense of fear and vulnerability toward terrorist attacks. The strongest relationship was for the following item: “I feel personally at risk for being a victim of a terrorist attack.” Along those lines, perceived threat of terrorism among Americans, specifically, leads to support for war — especially wars targeting Arabs and Muslims in the Middle East.

Consistent with this,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">research</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;using the “Belief in a Dangerous World” scale&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">has shown that perceptions of a hostile world lead to authoritarian attitudes&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">and derogation of out-groups</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;(Altemeyer 1988; Duckitt et al. 2002),&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">which</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, as mentioned above,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">have been linked to aggressive and violent attitudes toward out-groups, including support for war</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;(e.g., Altemeyer 1988; Duckitt 2001; McFarland 2005). Furthermore, Willer et al. (2008) found that those who view others generally as untrustworthy are significantly more likely to support war. There is also some research that examines the origins of perceived threat and, most specifically, right wing authoritarianism. Those high in RWA are believed to have had much harsher and more punitive (i.e., threatening) upbringings that emphasized strict adherence to rules and norms (Duckitt 2001). In fact, it is theorized that authoritarian attitudes manifest themselves in order to help combat the perpetual sense of threat and insecurity that was instilled during childhood.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Inter-group prejudice and the related construct of ethnocentrism are also major contributing factors to support for war</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">. Ethnocentrism is the belief that one’s own group and that group’s culture are superior to all others (Kam and Kinder 2007). Kam and Kinder (2007) used a direct measure of ethnocentrism and found it to be a robust predictor of support for war in Iraq. However, inter-group prejudice and ethnocentrism is more often operationalized in past research on war in other forms. The most common way of operationalizing them is by&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">using the “Social Dominance Orientation” (SDO)</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;scale. High SDO individuals tend to perceive the world as highly competitive and hierarchical, believing that certain groups of people (especially their own group) are inherently better than others and should dominate lesser groups in society (Duckitt 2001; Pratto, Sidanius, Stallworth, Malle 1994; Sidanius and Pratto 1993; Sidanius and Pratto 1999).&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">High SDO individuals are driven</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;by in-group dominance motives&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">to establish and maintain power over other groups.</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;Furthermore, having a&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">high SDO likely stems from</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;having a tough-minded, power-hungry personality, and from&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">viewing the world as a “competitive jungle” that is ruthless and zero-sum</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;(Duckitt 2001; Duckitt et al. 2002; but see also Jost and Thompson 2000 for a more complex view). The properties of social dominance orientation are explained by&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">“</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">Social Dominance Theory</span>”<span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;which&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background: yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">contends</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;that&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">societies develop</span> ideologies, or “<em><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow">legitimizing myths</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">,”&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">that provide justification for, and</span> help <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">maintain</span>, group <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">inequalities.

Along these lines,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">researchers have identified SDO as a foundational ideology behind prejudice</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;(e.g., Duckitt 2001; Duckitt et al. 2002; Duckitt and Sibley 2007)&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">and have empirically associated SDO with</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;various forms of&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">discrimination</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, including anti-black&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">racism</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">, antiArab racism, negative attitudes toward Middle Easterners, negative attitudes toward miscegeny,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">U.S. dominance over other nations, cultural elitism, and opposition to</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">women’s</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;and gay rights (Heaven, Organ, Supavadeeprasit, and Leeson 2006; Pratto et al. 1994). Research on SDO has shown that it is also predictive of support for war and war related activities. Specifically, in past studies&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">SDO&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">was&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">positively correlated with</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;prowar attitudes and support for the US-led wars in Afghanistan and both wars in Iraq (Cohrs et al. 2005; Crowson et al. 2006; Heaven et al. 2006; McFarland 2005; Pratto et al. 1994), as well as&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">support for the idea of going to war in pursuit of perceived national economic interests, such as oil prices</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;(Pratto et al. 1994). More recent research based on American Environics data from the spring of 2007 shows that SDO also predicts support among Americans for a military attack on Iran (Willer et al. 2008). However, the militancy of those high in SDO disappears entirely for – and may even correlate 10 negatively with – support for wars framed as humanitarian (e.g. military efforts to prevent genocide) (McFarland and Matthews 2005; Pratto et al. 1994; but see also Cohrs et al. 2005). These findings suggest that SDO is related to pro-war attitudes, but only if those wars are perceived as dominance oriented.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><h3 id="H2NCLink2014Supply2FExportControl" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>2NC Link—Supply/Export Control</span></h3><h4 id="HSupplygroupsdichotomizetheFirstandThirdworld2014thisresultsinracistpolicing." class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Supply groups dichotomize the First and Third world—this results in racist policing.</span></h4><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">Mutimer 2k</span>—David Mutimer is Deputy Director of YCISS and Associate Professor of Political Science at York University <em>The Weapons State</em>, ch. 5, “Entailing Self and Other,” pg. 96-97</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">The</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;central&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background: yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">practices of</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;supplier groups and</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;their attendant&nbsp;</span><em><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow">export controls</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">&nbsp;construct a</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;core&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">set of inside states</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">those sufficiently responsible</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;and mature&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">to take it upon themselves to judge the behavior of other states</span> and sanction them for troubling activities<span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">That set overlaps</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;notably&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">with the</span> club of advanced industrial States of the <span style="background: yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">North</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">.

The logic of the 'balance' between the superpowers, it has been argued, is that mutual assured destruction with nuclear weapons introduces a caution conducive to 'stability'. If the metaphors of the Cold War are adopted to imagine the new international security environment, there seems little way to escape the conclusions of this argument, that nuclear weapons can be stabilisers. Indeed, it has led John Mearsheimer to argue:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:.3in;margin-bottom:0in; margin-left:.4in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">If complete Soviet withdrawal from Eastern Europe proves unavoidable, the West faces the question of how to maintain peace in a multipolar Europe.

The best hope for avoiding war in post-Cold War Europe is nuclear deterrence; hence some nuclear proliferation is necessary to compensate for the withdrawal of the Soviet and American nuclear arsenals from Central Europe. Emphasis added.62</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">As part of the 'managed proliferation' of nuclear weapons in Europe, Mearsheimer suggests provision of nuclear arms to Germany. On this and on other points Mearsheimer's argument has been widely, and justifiably, attacked. But what is interesting about it is the way in which it makes the entailments of the 'stability' and 'balance' metaphors so clear.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">What is important is to assure</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;that&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">the&nbsp;</span><em><span style="font-size:12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">numbers of weapons are distributed</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">&nbsp;so</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;that&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">the balance</span> among them <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">is stable</span> — regardless of who holds the weapons. <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">The problems of history and politics</span> which would be raised<span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;by German nuclear weapons&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">are</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;blithely&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">ignored, because the metaphors</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;informing Mearsheimer's conceptualisation&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">hide them entirely</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">.</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;Most of us are sufficiently sensitive to these problems that Mearsheimer's argument is jarringly uncomfortable.

It is not an accident that it was a conservative alliance facing a revolutionary challenge that formulated the practice we now call the balance of power. Nor is it an accident that the changes in Eastern Europe, while welcomed in the West on democratic grounds, were feared for their capability to introduce 'instability'.63&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background: yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">When a 'balance' is 'stable', an asymmetrical alteration</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;to either side&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow">introduces instability.</span> Thus <span style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">once a stable balance is achieved, the metaphor highlights the importance of the maintenance of the status quo</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">The&nbsp;</span><em><span style="font-size:12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">conservative bias</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;of the metaphors&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">is problematic</span>, even within the limited confines of a proliferation problem. <span style="background: yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">The goal of policy makers seems</span> clearly <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">to be the reduction of weapons</span> and their related technologies—at least in the arsenals of others! <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">The image, however,</span> which is informing the policy response to the problem, <em><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow">provides no support for reduction</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">&nbsp;once a stable balance is achieved.</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">There can be no guarantee</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;that&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow">any reduction</span> in arsenals, <span style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">even</span> a <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow">'symmetrical'</span> reduction, <span style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">would produce a</span> similarly <span style="background: yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">stable balance</span> at the lower levels of arms.<span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;Indeed,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">building on the received wisdom of the Cold War, there might even be a case to be made for high levels of arms, as&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">a 'balance' at high levels is&nbsp;</span><em><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow">more resistant</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">&nbsp;to small changes</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">—that is, it is more 'stable'</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><h3 id="HAT:We2019renotRacist" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>AT: We’re not Racist</span></h3><h4 id="HRacistintentisirrelevant2014theaff2019s201Cproliferationmetaphor201Dentailsanormativecommitmenttoracistpowerrelations." class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Racist intent is irrelevant—the aff’s “proliferation metaphor” entails a normative commitment to racist power relations.</span></h4><p class="MsoNormal"><span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">Biswas 1</span> (Shampa Biswas, Whitman College, Walla Walla, WA , 2001, “Nuclear Apartheid” as Political Position: Race as a Postcolonial Resource?” <em>Alternatives</em> 26.4, 485—522)</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">It is interesting here that the “self” (that opposes Fundamentalism) is clearly named—it is “democracy’ Democracy here becomes the marker of a common (modern) civilizational boundary that the BJP shares with the West in the act of’ naming the common enemy—(anti— modern) “Islamic fundamentalism.” An article in the BJP—published newsmagazine BJP Today titled The Fundamentalists sic Threat to USA,” which identifies the growing recognition within the United States of the emerging Muslim terrorist threat,87 is designed to more explicitly mark out this Islamic threat that plagues both the West and India.

Speaking of the narcissistic character, Rivierre noted that ultimately this individual lives in `fear of his own suicide or madness’; this is the essence of what she calls his depressive anxiety. It is necessary therefore to focus upon this dark side of the new Promethean for</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;this is a figure wracked by&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">guilt and</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;anxiety concerning the destructive consequences of his creative powers</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">First there is internal destruction.</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;In a recent bestseller, The Culture of Fear: Why Americans are Afraid of the Wrong Things, Barry Glassner (1999) investigates a range of social anxieties which have beset the American psyche, from panics about smack and gunslinging black teenagers to scares about satanic abuse and internet addiction. The book is a rich description of some of the fears that haunt the contemporary American psyche but it is ultimately disappointing for it offers little insight into the deeper cultural anxieties that the American media so cleverly exploits. What Glassner highlights, without ever examining, is the internal destruction consequent upon the American mode of development.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The US</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">A&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">is a grossly unequal society and one in which structural</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">inequality remains steadfastly mapped onto questions of race and class</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">. Right at the end of his book Glassner briefly examines the source of the moral panics he has described, suggesting that they are `oblique expressions of concern about problems Americans know to be pernicious but have not taken decisive action to quash – problems such as hunger, dilapidated schools, gun proliferation, and deficient health care for much of the US population’ (Glassner p.209). No more vivid expression of this social divisiveness can be found than in statistics regarding prison populations. According to recent Home Office (2000) figures, Britain, the worst offender in Europe, has a prison population of 72,000, equivalent to 139 per 100,000 people (Norway has 59). But the US tops the table with 686 per 100,000 (compared to China’s 111 and Brazil’s 133). The US prison population currently stands at 1.96 million people, an astronomical figure, the overwhelming proportion of whom are black men, and&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">US&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">government spends more on imprisonment than&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">on higher</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;education</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">! Contrary to the belief that the US exemplifies an effective multicultural society what we see is a severely restricted multiculturalism in which racial divisions, focusing upon the&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">exclusion of African-Americans and Latinos, are more entrenched than ever</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">. This has led some commentators to suggest that&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the US’s failure to understand global inequality and its incomprehension at the rage that many peoples feel towards it is an expression of its own inability to understand the sharpness of its own internal differences</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;(Shapiro 2003). But social disintegration in the US is not just mapped along racial lines. As the effects of decades of neo-Liberal social and fiscal policies accumulate it is increasingly clear that in the US the concept of a `safety net’, central to the post-war settlement in western type democracies, has all but disappeared. As a consequence, and this has been glimpsed in some of Richard Sennett’s (1998) recent work, failure can now have catastrophic psychological and material effects even upon the American middle classes. The result seems to be a form of `moral isolationism', which is spreading through American society, a feeling that there is no-one and no-thing to rely upon. And whilst associationism, despite Putnam’s (2000) gloomy prognostications, still seems to be a strong feature of civic culture in the USA, with a few exceptions, such as strong faith communities, this offers little consolation when the chips are really down. In the absence of collective solutions to shared risk Americans fall back upon themselves. But this is not healthy individualism but social anomie, an isolationism fueled by those survival anxieties which were first glimpsed by Christopher Lasch (1985).&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">There exists a second reservoir of guilt and&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">anxiety</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">which&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow">is</span> <span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">intimately&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">connected to</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;the&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">destructive creativity of</span> the <span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">America</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">n Prometheus.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">This can be traced back to the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">hideous and&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">monstrous child</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;that America, more than any other, nurtured from conception through to realisation.

Within a few years a whole genre of sci-fi American B movies, paperbacks and comics was flourishing in which the theme of mutation was a constant motif (Jancovich 1996). This was the return of the repressed, or, rather, the annihilated. A whole culture of paranoia was developing; partly fueled by the Cold War, a culture that remains a potent dimension of the American psyche to this day. Richard Hofstadter (1979) described how&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background: yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">this culture of paranoia</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;infused American politics</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">. Describing the paranoid style of the American politician, Hofstadter argues that&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">whilst retaining some of the characteristics of the clinical paranoiac</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;- overheated,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">oversuspicious, overaggressive, grandiose, and apocalyptic in expression</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;– this character does not perceive that the hostile and conspiratorial world is necessarily directed at him. Rather he sees all that is bad and evil directed at his nation, his culture and his way of life (Hofstadter, p.4). This has been typical of new right politics for many years and, for example, has resulted in persecutory immigration policies designed to protect ways of life that are often fictitious and based in phantasy. In a recent essay, Jason Cowley (2001) argues that this culture, despite its religiosity, ‘</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">is</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">essentially an entertainment culture,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">addicted to</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;narratives of&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">catastrophe’</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;in everything from film right through to computer games. Sat astride the pinnacle of this culture is Tom Clancy, the best-selling, Reagan-adoring writer of fiction such as the Sum of all Fears which presciently described the hijacking by Arab militants of civilian planes which were then used as weapons against the American people. Fiction becomes fact. America looks into the mirror of the world and sees an enemy, an enemy which if not contained will spread. Thus the `domino theory’, given vivid expression by Harry.S. Truman who succeeded Roosevelt as US President in 1944, a `theory’ which justified American intervention in Greece, Turkey and countless Latin American countries during the Cold War, inspired the Vietnam tragedy and now `the War on Terror’ in which a febrile Islam is imagined to be spreading rhizome-like around the edges of the `free world’. But who is this enemy if not Thanatos, Little Boy and all his heirs, the dark echoes of the idealisation of the American way of life - a variety and quantity of weapons of mass destruction which are now, like China’s citizens, almost beyond enumeration? In 2000 American defence expenditure stood at $295bn, this exceeded the combined expenditure of the rest of the world by almost $30bn. This year, 2003, it is set to rise by a further 14%, the biggest leap in over two decades, as a new generation of tactical nuclear weaponry, outlined in Rumsfeld’s `nuclear posture review’ of the previous year, is actively contemplated by the National Nuclear Security Agency (Guardian 2003). Despite the caution of John Quincy Adams, America’s sixth president, not to go `in search of monsters to destroy’, Rumsfeld and Co. are clearly bent on fostering the conditions that will keep this species sustainable for decades to come (and the US defence industry by the way).&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Such an overwhelming degree of military superiority betrays&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">not just the extent of American ambitions for global hegemony but also</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;the extent of America’s fear.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Returning to Riviere, she notes how&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">depressive&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">anxiety gives rise to</span> its own special defence, the <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">manic defence. In place of vulnerability there is omnipotence</span> <span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">and specifically an attitude of contempt and depreciation for the relationships upon which the narcissist depends. Listening to Richard Perle and other architects of the Project for the New American Century this contempt – for the United Nations, `Old Europe’ and countries which cannot or will not embrace the neo-conservative brand of modernisation – is explicit and worn with smirking pride. Contemplating the demise of the UN after the war on Iraq, Perle notes that `whilst the chatterbox on the Hudson will continue to bleat’ what will die `is the fantasy of the UN as the foundation of the new world order’ (Perle 2003). He then unleashes an apparently clinical demolition of the repeated failure of the Security Council to act against breaches of international law without providing even the faintest of hints that in truth it has been the US which has most consistently used its veto on the Security Council – nine times in all since 1990 against the four vetos cast by the other four members combined during the same period. And whilst we’re on the subject of inaction in the face of breaches of international law we’d do well to remember that over the last thirty years the USA has vetoed 34 UN resolutions on Israel and has consistently supported Israel’s routine violations of UN resolution 242 to which the US is a signatory. What we have here is both cold cunning – there is no room for the UN as a countervailing source of authority in `the Project’ –&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">and a paranoia</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;about the world&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow">which has become so routine that it is not even aware of itself</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Allusions to `threat’ and `security’ run like a thread throughout&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the brief manifesto of&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the Project</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, that is, its `Statement of Principles’.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">But&nbsp;</span><em><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow">what makes this paranoia, instead of a rational fear</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;response to the real threats&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">that exist to American hegemony around the world?&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The massive overkill,&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">the self-fulfilling nature of</span> so many American <span style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">interventions, the</span> uncanny <span style="background: yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">knack</span> that American foreign policy has displayed <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">of making its worst fears come true</span>, the classic paranoid conviction that one is the misunderstood victim and never the perpetrator, <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow">the</span> complete <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">inability to perceive how ones</span> own <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow">‘defensive actions’ are</span> experienced by the other as <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">provocation</span> and threat<span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;–&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">wherever we look, the ‘arms race’ with the Soviet Union</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, the run-up to the Cuban Missile Crisis,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">fear of communist contagion in&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">S.E&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Asia&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">and Latin America,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">current ‘</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">war on terror</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">ism’&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">and ‘containment’ of N.Korea we see the same mixture of provocation, ineptness and misunderstanding.</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;In his recent book on paranoia, David Bell (2003) notes how the fears that the paranoid is subject to are the echo of what has become alien(ated). In this way Melanie Klein adds a twist to our understanding of alienation by insisting that&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">what we project into the world</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;forever&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">threatens to</span> return and <span style="background: yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">haunt us</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">. Bell notes how films such as Alien and The Conversation vividly depict this. Indeed Klein argues that&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">through projective identification&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">the other can become subject to control</span> by self, in subtle ways <span style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">becoming nudged</span> and coerced <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">into enacting what is put into them</span>. In this way <em><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">paranoia can become self-fulfilling</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;and it really does seem as if the world is out to get you.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">God’s chosen people Estimates suggest that well over 60% of the citizens of the USA engage in religious worship on a regular basis – in Britain the figure is more like 7%. Christian fundamentalism has become particularly powerful in the USA since the late 1960’s, perhaps as the backlash towards 60’s `godlessness’. But these fundamentalist movements seem to be simply the tip of the iceberg that is modern American religiosity. Indeed, as Karen Armstrong (2001) noted, the concept of `fundamentalism’ was first coined to characterise the emergence of charismatic religious movements in N.America at the beginning of the twentieth century. In fact God and America have walked hand in hand ever since the Founding Fathers. This has found a powerful and consistent expression in the politics of the United States, and particularly in its foreign policy, where analysts have coined the phrase `American exceptionalism’ to describe the belief that `the United States is an extraordinary nation with a special role to play in human history’ (McCrisken 2001). Almost from the beginning of the occupation by European settlers N.America has been construed as a promised land and its citizens a chosen people. The New World was, in this sense contrasted with the Old, a world of famine, war and intolerance from which many of these settlers had fled. McCrisken provides countless indications of this exceptionalist belief system from George Washington to Bill Clinton but all are characterised by certain common suppositions – that America is the land of the free, that its intentions are inherently benevolent, that inside every non-American there is an American struggling to get out and, perhaps most importantly given the War on Terror and the occupation of Iraq, that the US is the embodiment of universal human values based on the rights of all mankind – freedom, democracy and justice. Weinberg (1935) described this in terms of the belief in `manifest destiny’ which gave successive administrations in the nineteenth century the sense of America’s special mission to bring freedom to the peoples of the world, as in the Mexican War or the Spanish-American War which led to the `liberation’ of Cuba.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Today the sense of manifest destiny is no less strong but now it is garbed in the cloak of ‘modernisation’</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">– the belief that all societies pass through certain stages of development</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;(from traditional to modern)&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">that the West, and particularly&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the U</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">nited&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">S</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">tates,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">is the common endpoint towards which all peoples must&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">irresistibly&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">move</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">. Of course, this is Fukuyama’s `end of history’ and it is perhaps no surprise to find him to be (along with Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz and Co.) one of the 25 signatories to the Statement of Principles (written in June 1997) of the Project for the New American Century – the neo-Conservative manifesto which now directs American and British foreign policy. The point about all this is that&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">this very idealisation of America</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;by Americans, its self-identification with virtue,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">contributes&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">enormously both to its innocence and&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">to its arrogance</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">. There is often a real generosity of spirit and a friendly naivete which strikes the non-American (at least the English ones) when encountering an American citizen. One thinks of the countless jokes about the American as an `innocent abroad’ captured in the image of the gawping American tourist. But there is also the arrogance added to this, an arrogance which leads even hard nosed strategists to assume that invading troops need know nothing about the peoples that they are about to `liberate’, a mistake which had tragic consequences in Somalia and is now being repeated in Iraq. Moreover this is an arrogance which leaves Americans with such a strong sense that they have virtue on their side, and it is</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;this&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">that has</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;provided the fertile ground for the splitting and paranoia which has been&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">such a feature of</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;the American view of the world&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">since the Second World War. Again, if we return to Hofstadter's ideas about American politics we can see this paranoid belief in a vast and sinister conspiracy which is set out to undermine and destroy a way of life. Indeed for Hofstadter, ‘</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">the paranoid spokesman sees</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;the&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow">fate</span> of this conspiracy <span style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">in apocalyptic terms</span> - he traffics in the birth and death of whole worlds<span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">, whole political orders, whole systems of human values. He is always manning the barricades of civilization’ (Hofstadter 1979, p.29). Three decades on and this still sounds very familiar. One thinks of the `fighting talk’ of George Bush in the war on Iraq, in the fight against the Axis of Evil, and the struggle against global terrorism - fighting terror with terror, the talion morality of the paranoid schizoid position, destroying and re-creating political systems, acting as the purveyor of civilization to the world. This then, is a world in which American society has been called upon to resist the spreading evils, first of communism, now of militant Islam. Moreover, it has been this splitting of good and evil which fueled the rise of McCarthyism in the 1950’s and which is threatening American civil liberties today.

David Bell develops this theme in his commentary on Mike Davis’s recent NLR article (Davis 2001) in which he notes that the resort, following September 11th, to increasingly pervasive forms of security and control within the USA actually contributes the very anxiety these measures seek to address. Bell argues, `</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">the</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">grandiose&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">demand for</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;complete&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">security creates</span> ever <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">more</span>, in our minds, <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">enemies endowed with our</span> own <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">omnipotence who are imagined as seeking to control us’</span> (<span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Bell, p.37).

McCrisken (2003) refers to the `Vietnam syndrome’ as a defining element of American foreign policy since the 1970’s, something which formed the backdrop to the first Gulf War through which it reached a partial and incomplete resolution. Vietnam was a trauma for the USA in two ways. The American claim to have a monopoly on virtue was destroyed by successive scandals, atrocities and outrages, in fact they were revealed to be as savage as any other occupying power. Jean-Paul Sartre (1968) famously argued that the war waged by America on Vietnam was implicitly genocidal. Indeed for Sartre, the war in Vietnam signified a new stage in the development of imperialism - 'it is the greatest power on earth against a poor peasant people. Those who fight it are living out the only possible relationship between an over-industrialized country and an under-developed country, that is to say, a genocidal relationship implemented through racism' (p.42). Worse still, they lost the war, against one of the most economically backward societies imaginable the might of American military power came to nought. The impact of Vietnam was such that the USA virtually avoided direct military involvement for twenty five years, preferring indirect involvement (encouraging and equipping Iraq versus Iran, Afghanistan versus the Soviet Union) or direct engagement in situations such as tiny Grenada where they could hardly lose. The Vietnam Syndrome also encouraged the development of an approach to warfare which gave maximum emphasis to the use of air power and the avoidance of ground troops, something exemplified by the intervention in Kosovo and, later, Afghanistan.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">We can</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;also&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">understand the Vietnam Syndrome in terms of Freud’s work on trauma</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;and his notions of repetition and working through.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Trauma&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">(whether loss of limb or sexual abuse)&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">is an attack upon the narcissistic organisation of the</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">psyche</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">/body, it is experienced as loss which is irreparable.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">But loss can be managed sufficiently</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;for a life to move on,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">and for this to occur a place in the psyche</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">/culture&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">needs to be found in which some of the shock, rage, horror and grief can be addressed</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">symbolically</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">. And for a while in the 1970’s elements of the liberal American intelligentsia were able to initiate such a process through critical self-analysis, literature, film and music. But a quite different response, based upon a manic form of denial, was waiting in the wings. Freud notes how a&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">child may engage in the repetition of traumatic experience in an attempt to&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">magically&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">overcome it by reversing the subject/object relationship, by&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">becoming master rather than victim</span>.

Its not easy to forget the horror of that day. There was no absence of bodies then. Horrific scenes of people jumping out of windows, running for life, mangled and dismembered corpses. On September 11th we witnessed true annihilation, not a film, just annihilation. As Cowley (2001) acutely observed, `Islamic terrorists appropriated the destructive impulses of American entertainment culture, making of a nation’s apocalyptic fantasies a terrifying actuality, as if they were attempting to speak to the Americans in their own language’. This was a massive attack on the security of the American nation. As Hanna Segal (2002) noted, the trauma of the terrorist attack had an added dynamic 'the crushing realisation that there is somebody out there who actually hates you to the point of annihilation'. It is now commonplace to say that the USA lost its innocence on September 11th. But what it really lost was its embrace of the imaginary. Until that day the American psyche had been consumed by a helpless fascination with a fictional threat, or rather a series of fictional threats; on September 11th they received the shock of the real. `Welcome to the world’ some people said. Suddenly Americans became as vulnerable as the rest of us. The immediate response to September 11th was bewilderment and incredulity. Again, as Segal noted, the question on most American lips was `why’? It is a common reaction for people in trauma situations to think that people are out to get them, ‘in the case of the terrorist attacks it is actually a true fact. One’s worst nightmares come true’. Segal added another dimension - the symbolism of the twin towers and the Pentagon. This is very important if we are to try and understand the meanings and motivations behind the war on Iraq. So, the symbolism equates to ‘we are all-powerful, with our weapons, finance, high tech - we can dominate you completely’. The suicide bombers destroyed this omnipotence. As Segal noted: we were pushed into a world of terror versus terror, disintegration and confusion. The shock was followed by mourning and barely contained anxiety. The president of the United States of America appeared on global television networks as `the child adult’, a little boy lost. At first he seemed quite inadequate to the part that was being demanded of him. It almost looked like he wanted to run – asking, `why me’? For weeks the USA was gripped by a wave of panics about anthrax and other impending attacks. But traces of American triumphalism were being quickly reasserted. The flags which, from Maine to Arizona, first hung from poles and windows in grief quickly transmuted into a sign of strength and resolution, and later, to bellicosity. This other mood could also be discerned in homage to the courage of fire crews and emergency service personnel and to the passengers who overcame the hi-jackers on the fourth plane (`let’s roll’). But rage took time to gather. Many liberals and leftists in Europe anticipated an outpouring of vengeful rhetoric from the Republicans, but it did not come. Rather, the response was surprisingly measured and multilateral. And whilst many opposed the war of the `coalition against terror’ against Afghanistan, at least the connection with September 11th seemed obvious – Al Quaeda was clearly being protected by the Taliban regime. It was only when this phyric victory had been swiftly achieved that a shift, symbolised by the `Axis of Evil’ speech in January 2002, into a more paranoid and in-your-face triumphalist discourse began. The question of weapons of mass destruction became central to the moral and ethical charge for war. Was there any proof of their existence? The weapons inspectors could find none, yet we were told time after time that clear evidence existed, even though the documents cited had very little credibility. Again, as Hofstadter noted,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">typical&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">procedure of&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">higher&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">paranoid scholarship</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;is to&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">start by accumalating</span> facts, or <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow">what appear to be facts to establish 'proof'</span> that a conspiracy exists - <em><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt; background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">the paranoid mentality seeks a coherence that reality cannot provide</span></em><span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">.

The bad object/other becomes the fixation point of our anger, fear, rage and paranoia.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">Excessive projection leaves the individual in</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;mortal&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">fear</span> of an attack<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;from the bad object.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Thus&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight: yellow">we</span> try and <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">destroy this object, lest it</span> comes back to<span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">destroy us</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">. The question arises though, as to what happens when these destructive forces are unable to find a satisfactory object</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">. Despite the measured and multi-lateral nature of the intervention there was still something murderous and retaliatory about the attack on the people of Afghanistan. An attack based in the talion morality of the paranoid schizoid position - an eye for an eye.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The problem with</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;the war in&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Afghanistan&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">against the Taliban&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">was there was no sense of gratification</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">and the lust to get equal was never satisfied</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">. There are several reasons for this. First, the bombing of Afghanistan simply wasn’t enough to either exact revenge, or to demonstrate the power of the Apocalypse - you cannot bomb the stone age back into the stone age even though, as Sartre (1968, p.40) had noted over thirty years earlier, this had already been attempted in Vietnam with disastrous effects. Second, Bin Laden disappeared, vaporised - there was no bad object to destroy. Finally, the exercise of military might, of unadulterated power had nothing to be powerful over - power only exists if people are the objects of that power. Instead we seemed to have an increasingly paranoid American population and its government on the one hand and disappearing enemy bodies on the other. And then came the `Axis of Evil’ speech and a further ratcheting up of the spiral of splitting, projection, paranoid phantasy, and defensive offence. White House rhetoric began providing florid depictions of a world divided between good and evil in which there was no `in between’, `you are either with us or you are against us’. Fakhry Davids (2002) notes that the events of September 11th were brought home vividly to us by the wall to wall media coverage - the shocking images of the planes crashing into the twin towers of the World Trade Centre, and then its collapse.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Psychically unbearable events</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, argues Davids,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">call into play powerful defences whose aim is to protect us from perceived danger</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">. For Davids, the extent to which the event has been reframed in stereotyped racist terms is apparent everywhere, ‘the problem has now been reduced to a conflict between the enlightened, civilised, tolerant, freedom loving, clean living democrat versus the bearded, robed, Kalashnikov bearing bigoted, intolerant, glint in the eye fundamentalist fanatic, or viewed from the other side, the humble believer with God on his side versus the infidel armed with all the worldly might of the devil’ (Davids 2002, p.362). For Davids,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">it is difficult for us to find neutral ground</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;- you are either with us, or against us - which side are you on?&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">This&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">reduction of a complex situation into black and white</span>, good and bad <span style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">is a paranoid solution to</span> intense <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">anxiety which reinforces</span> <span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">self-idealisation</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;which we have seen lies at the heart of&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">American&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">exceptionalism</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">. As Davids notes,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">such a world view makes us feel&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">that&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">we know who we are, and may justify actions that make us feel better. The problem is that we don’t face the problem. There have been many arguments about why America</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;and Britain decided to&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">wage war on Iraq</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">. All quite plausible in their own right - Saddam the evil dictator, Saddam the murderer of his own people, then there are the economic, the oil, the money to be made from reconstructing the country, the geo-political, securing the middle east - stopping a snowball of violence, and of course harbouring the terrorist. Then of course there are the weapons of mass destruction, yet to be found, despite the documentation of the paranoid conspirators. All these explanations contribute to a fuller picture, but as David Hare (2003) recently wrote,&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the main motivation behind&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">this&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">war was a simply assertion of&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">American&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">power, ‘the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">feral&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">pleasure of the flex’.</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Uppity Saddam had dared to piss on the boots of Uncle Sam</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">A lesson in respect was due</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">An annihilatory lesson aimed at the global</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;(and not just Islamic)&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">psyche</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">. But we’ve been here before.

Denial&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">of the real and a manic reassertion of omnipotence</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">. The war on Iraq was a demonstration of pure and total power. It became sanitised as a film of all the elements that might obstruct or resist power. There were no bodies, just empty tanks, boots and buildings that were endlessly pounded as a demonstration of shock andawe. The Iraqi bodies disappeared, the presidential guard disappeared and then Saddam disappeared, as did the mighty Republican Guard and, oh yes, it seems so have the weapons of mass destruction. Peter Preston (2003) commented along similar lines, `the missing link, for those of us watching far away is death: the bodies of the men and women who have died’. Preston argued that the televised war turned away from the reality of the situation. Nobody wanted to see dead bodies, wounded soldiers or civilians suffering. We can watch the bombs falling, but not see the effect - ‘the dead become undead for photographic purposes’. In Britain, the first time we saw blood and bodies, despite the apocalyptic first night of the cruise missiles, was a report by John Simpson two weeks into the war. Simpson (2003) was with a convey of Kurdish fighters and American special forces when they came under attack from American warplanes: "This is just a scene from hell here. All the vehicles on fire. There are bodies burning around me, there are bodies lying around, there are bits of bodies on the ground. This is a really bad own goal by the Americans" . The very graphic images were even worse, broadcast on BBC television - blood dripping down the windscreen of a vehicle while the reporter sat inside. The cameraman wiping blood from the lens of the camera with his fingers. It was as if the full horror of war had suddenly hit the world. We could at last see the very symbolic and sickening images of a real, as opposed to a hyperreal war. It is paradoxical that there has been more emphasis on casualties since the end of the war. Some conclusions The destruction of the world trade centre was a terrible event in world history, a terrible shock to the American psyche and brought terrible traumas to the ordinary citizens of New York. For the USA as the only world power, the bubble was burst. Coppolla wasn’t there, or even Bruce Willis to protect the ordinary person in the street - the terrorists struck at the very heart of America. The tables, however, were turned and the Middle East temporarily succumbed to the (film) show of power (with no casualties), the show that should have protected the twin towers but didn’t. The problem is we cannot have war without bodies - and there cannot be power without being in relation to the other. Despite the fact the neo-Conservatives were itching to take on Saddam before Bush even got into office, despite the fact that for some of these strategists September 11th was therefore both a shock and an opportunity sent from heaven, despite the long period of military preparation and the diplomatic side-show conducted by that naïve Mr Blair that accompanied it, despite all this the occupation of Iraq looks like being a piece of inept foreign policy making in the best traditions of American irrationalism. Little thought appears to have been given to what happens once the military occupation was achieved, to the problem of law and order or to reviving the basic infrastructure. Little thought appears to have been given to the possibility that armed Saddam loyalists might `melt’ into the night in order to fight a sustained campaign of sabotage and guerilla warfare or that the repressed Shias might quickly fill the power vacuum left by the collapse of the Baathists and look to their theocratic Shia neighbours in Iran as guide and model.

Therefore, the court remanded for a factual determination as to whether the loss of withdrawal benefits constituted liquidated damages or an unacceptable penalty. n100</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">The majority opinion justified this break with years of nationwide precedent by reasoning that "a revolution in the practice of law has occurred." n101 This "revolution" required the "economic interests of the law firm to be protected as they are in other business enterprises." n102 The court supported its recognition of a "revolution" by noting the increased propensity of law firms--even large, seemingly stable firms--to split up as partners grab clients on the way out. n103 As a result, noncompetition agreements have become common, despite the near universal recognition by courts and ethics committees that such agreements are unenforceable. n104 Furthermore, the court reasoned that the pervasiveness of lateral hiring, even among high-level partners, has undermined the assumption that firms are stable institutions. n105 The court concluded that,</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">&nbsp;*821 &nbsp;due to these "sweeping changes" in the profession, the per se rule banning noncompetition agreements among law partners should be abolished. n106</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">The court then addressed some of the arguments made by the dissent and by other courts upholding the ban. According to the majority of the court, two primary arguments exist in support of the ban: (1) an attorney should have the freedom to practice law where and for whom he or she pleases, n107 and (2) clients are not commodities and should have the freedom to choose representation. n108 The majority argued that these freedoms are merely "theoretical" because they are routinely circumscribed. n109 For example, attorneys, like other professionals, may be fired or forced out by their partners despite the wishes of the client. n110 Similarly, an attorney is not required to accept representation of every client that seeks services, and a lawyer may even be required to decline representation of a prospective client if a conflict of interest exists. n111 In fact, an attorney has many grounds to justify terminating a relationship with a client. n112 Finally, the majority noted that, in civil cases, clients have no "right" to an attorney at all. n113 Thus, these "freedoms," upon which the per se rule is justified, are in fact already limited. n114</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">The court proceeded a step further, arguing that permitting restrictive covenants may even serve the client. According to the court, the ban promoted a "culture of mistrust" and damaged the stability of law firms. n115 Partners may be reluctant to refer clients to or support the practice of their fellow partners if fear persists that a partner may leave with those clients at any time. n116 The court concluded that the changing nature of the business of law, the permissibility of such covenants in other *822 &nbsp;professions, and the undesirable promotion of the culture of mistrust required the abolition of the per se ban on lawyer restrictive covenants. n117 The court remanded the case to the trial court for analysis under the test of reasonableness applicable to all restrictive covenants. n118</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">Justice Kennard, the sole dissenting justice, made several arguments in support of the per se ban. First, Kennard offered a different interpretation of Rule 1-500 of the Rules of Professional Conduct, arguing that the rule was unambiguous: agreements that restrict competition are unethical. n119 She criticized the majority's argument as flawed because it interpreted "restrict" to mean "prohibit" and claimed that a reasonable cost was not a restriction. n120 According to the dissent, this interpretation does not give the words their plain and ordinary meaning. n121 In their ordinary meaning, restrict and prohibit are not synonymous; a price as high as 82.5% of net profits certainly constitutes a restriction. n122 Therefore, the partnership agreement violated the clear meaning of the rule.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">In support of this interpretive argument, the dissent cited the "discussions" that accompany the Rules and "provide guidance for interpretation." n123 The discussions accompanying Rule 1-500, which the majority ignored, were unequivocal:</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">$ (Rule 1-500$ ) permits a restrictive covenant in a law corporation, partnership, or employment agreement. The law corporation shareholder, partner, or associate may agree not to have a separate practice during the existence of the relationship; however, upon termination of the relationship (whether voluntary or involuntary), the member is free to practice law without any contractual restriction . . . . n124</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">According to the dissent, the court should not have endorsed an interpretation completely inconsistent with this unambiguous commentary. n125</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">Second, the dissent argued that, despite the majority's perceived "revolution" in the practice of law, n126 the law is still primarily a profession, and lawyers should continue to strive for the highest ethical standards. n127 Although no one in the private sector could continue to practice law without a profit, an attorney has a very high fiduciary duty. This duty often requires an attorney to place the interest of a client above her own interest. Therefore, the client's right to choose representation is paramount to the interests of the attorney. n128 Enforcing covenants not to compete, on the other hand, would subordinate the client's rights to the monetary interests of established firms. n129</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">Next, the dissent attacked the argument that, since noncompetition agreements are enforceable in other professions, lawyers should not be treated differently. n130 According to the dissent, the ethics rules of other professions are not helpful because "the nature, ideals, and practices of the various professions are different." n131 Notwithstanding the rules with respect to other professions, lawyers should strive to obtain the highest ethical standards because "ethics is not a subject in which the objective is to achieve consensus at the level of the lowest common denominator." n132 &nbsp;&nbsp;*824</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">Finally, the dissent noted that the purpose of ethics regulations is to protect the public, not the monetary interests of law firms. n133 According to the dissent, the majority subordinated the rights of clients and lawyers to the business interests of firms and justified this erosion of ethics standards by concluding that these rights are merely "theoretical" because they are already circumscribed. n134 The dissent strenuously disagreed with the majority's conclusion, arguing that this analysis was irrelevant. The issue in this case was not whether a partner may be forced out of a law firm, nor whether a conflict of interest existed; n135 the issue was whether the defendant-law firm could "prevent a willing attorney from representing a willing client." n136 Therefore, the majority's analysis on this point was merely "rationalization, not reasoning." n137</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">The dissent concluded that the court should not promote the weakening of ethical standards and that the integrity of the legal profession demanded upholding the per se ban on covenants not to compete between law partners. n138</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">IV. Analysis and Recommendations</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">Although the Howard court set out persuasive policy reasons for abolishing the per se ban on lawyer restrictive covenants, the majority's reasoning contained several flaws. First, the court misconstrued the meaning of the ethics rule: under the majority's interpretation, the rule prohibits only outright bans on competition. In reaching this conclusion, the court violated several rules of statutory construction. Second, the court failed to recognize the need to articulate a new standard for law partners. Instead, the court held that agreements between law partners should be analyzed under the "rule of reason" test applicable to ordinary business partnerships. This Comment contends that the rules of &nbsp;ethics, as currently written, mandate a higher standard for attorneys than for other types of partners. In abrogating the per se ban, courts should interpret the rule in a manner that balances the changing nature of the practice of law with the competing ethical considerations.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a. proper construction of the rules of professional conduct</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The Howard court began its analysis by examining the California Business and Professions Code, which expressly permits reasonable restrictive covenants among business partners. n139 The court noted that this provision had long applied to doctors and accountants and concluded that the general language of the statute provided no indication of an exception for lawyers. n140 After reaching this conclusion, however, the court noted that, since it had the authority to promulgate a higher standard for lawyers, the statute alone did not necessarily control, n141 and the court therefore proceeded to examine the California Rules of Professional Conduct. n142 The court avoided the apparent conflict between the business statute and the ethics rule by undertaking a strained reading of the rule.

Share-in-savings contracts, on the other hand is a method in which the government pays back the contractor over time utilizing the savings generated by the product. However, DOD is generally more concerned with warfighting capability which does not normally equate to operating efficiencies. Therefore, of the options listed by the GAO, Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) or Private Finance Initiatives (PFI) seems to be the most promising for procurement of new capabilities.

In the Taoist classic Huai-nan-tzu, one finds a famous story of a man who suddenly finds himself the unexpected owner of a new horse. &nbsp;His neighbors congratulate him on his good fortune, until his son falls from the horse and breaks his leg. &nbsp;The man's neighbors then act to console him on his bad fortune, until army conscriptors arrive and carry off all the able-bodied young men, leaving the injured young man behind as worthless. &nbsp;The lesson of the story is that&nbsp;</span><span class="TitleChar">when an event occurs,&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">we are quick to judge</span> it as fortunate or unfortunate, <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">but our judgments are</span> often <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">mistaken</span>, as later events often prove<span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">.6 &nbsp;And one of the most heavily stressed lessons of the Chuang-tzu is that&nbsp;</span><span class="TitleChar" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">humans</span><span class="TitleChar">&nbsp;quickly&nbsp;</span><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">judge</span> events <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">on the basis of what we accept on the basis of simplistic assumptions</span> — e.g., that life is inherently better than death — and that <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">the wise person learns to</span> question and <span style="background:yellow; mso-highlight:yellow">discard such assumptions, and forego</span> such <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">judgments</span> regarding events<span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">. When Chuang-tzu's wife died, Chuang-tzu does not argue that the world is a better place for her absence, or that his life is improved by his sudden new freedom. &nbsp;In fact, there is no issue in the passage of whether the world is better off with Chuang-tzu's wife alive or dead. &nbsp;The only issue in the passage is that&nbsp;</span><span class="TitleChar">people are born</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;</span><span class="TitleChar">and</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;that&nbsp;</span><span class="TitleChar">people later die</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">, and&nbsp;</span><span class="TitleChar">to ignore that basic fact would display culpable stupidity</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">. &nbsp;The very same lesson is impressed upon the reader of the previous passage, regarding the sudden transformation of a character's elbow. &nbsp;What we are taught in that passage is that&nbsp;</span><span class="TitleChar">life is a process of ineluctable change and transformation, and that humans would be profoundly wrong and clearly silly to object to such change</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">. &nbsp;Another element of the lesson is that&nbsp;</span><span class="TitleChar">the nature of human life is not separate from</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, or other than,&nbsp;</span><span class="TitleChar">the nature of nonhuman life</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">. &nbsp;If, for instance, one were to see a driver accidentally run over one's child or beloved, one's first instinct might be to attack the driver with a righteous fury, falsely equating emotional intensity and violent action with the responsible exercise of moral judgment. In general,&nbsp;</span><span class="TitleChar">we work to teach ourselves</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;and each other not&nbsp;</span><span class="TitleChar">to</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;respond in that way, to take a course of self-restraint,&nbsp;</span><span class="TitleChar">curb</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">ing&nbsp;</span><span class="TitleChar">emotion</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">,&nbsp;</span><span class="TitleChar">lest it propel us into actions that will later, upon calm reflection, be revealed to have been emotionally satisfying but morally wrong</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">. &nbsp;If I saw my child run down by a car, it might give me great emotional satisfaction to drag the driver from her car and beat her to death. &nbsp;But it might well turn out that she had in fact done nothing wrong, and had been driving legally and quite responsibly when a careless child suddenly ran into her path, giving her no time to stop or to evade the child.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="TitleChar">Because we have all learned that the truth of events is often not apparent to the parties that are experiencing them, we generally work to learn some degree of self-control, so that our immediate emotional reaction to events does not mislead us into a foolish course of action</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">. Now if we take these facts and transfer them into our consideration of Chuang-tzu and Mencius on the riverbank, that episode should, logically, be read as follows. &nbsp;If Mencius feels an emotional urge to jump into the river to save the baby, his emotional response to the baby's presence there must be seen as immature and irresponsible.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="TitleChar">After all, one might muse, one never knows, any more than the man with the horse, when an event that seems fortunate is actually unfortunate, or vice versa</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="TitleChar">What if the baby</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;in the water&nbsp;</span><span class="TitleChar">had been</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">&nbsp;the ancient Chinese equivalent of&nbsp;</span><span class="TitleChar">Adolf Hitler</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">,&nbsp;</span><span class="TitleChar">and the saving of young Adolf — though occasioned by the deepest feelings of compassion, and a deep-felt veneration for "life" — led to the systematic extermination of millions of innocent men, women, and children? &nbsp;If one knew</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, in retrospect,&nbsp;</span><span class="TitleChar">that Hitler's atrocities could have been totally prevented by the simple moral act of refraining from leaping to save an endangered child, would one not conclude, by sound moral reasoning, that letting that particular baby drown would have represented a supremely moral act?</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">&nbsp;How, Chuang-tzu constantly challenges us,&nbsp;</span><span class="TitleChar" style="background:yellow;

Again, like with suffering coming from old age, you just have to accept these effects when they come, and deal with them in the best way possible. &nbsp;Inescapable suffering includes certain mental traumas as well, like experiencing the deaths of beloved ones and separation. It also includes some of the suffering others inflict upon you. &nbsp;Inescapable suffering encompasses everything that is linked to impermanence, which is extensive.

People who have everything - wealth, health and good friends - and they nevertheless turn what should be paradise into their own personal hell.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">There is a restlessness in people that comes from neglecting the spirit, and which can only be satisfied in the sphere of the spirit</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">As long as this aspect of the human being is neglected, the human will never come to peace, and will suffer in many ways</span><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">.

Even the enlightened suffer in this world. Sometimes their suffering is caused by their compassion and wisdom. &nbsp;Schools dedicated to the Bodhisattva tradition argue that suffering cannot end for anyone as long as a single creature on earth is still suffering. It is very true, isn’t it? How can anyone filled with compassion be totally happy as long as there is still suffering around one? &nbsp;Causes of suffering&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><strong><span class="StyleBoldUnderline" style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">Attachment and the ego</span></strong><strong><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&nbsp;are closely linked, and they are the main causes of suffering, for they&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">encourage perpetual action to satisfy</span></strong><strong>&nbsp;their <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">unsatiable needs</span></strong><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">.&nbsp;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The ego not only causes harm on a personal level, but it is a source of destruction and hatred on a wide scale.

This is like trying to prevent our children from growing up, or our old people from dying.

Just like our own lives. Wanting to freeze ecosystems at a certain charming stage of their existence is like our other foolish dream of always being young, attractive and healthy ourselves. Good luck! &nbsp;The only ease lies with the process of evolution itself.

CONCLUSION<br/>The direct message of the dominant model is that United States energy policy is market driven. The implication of this message is equally clear. Given the structural setting of a complex policymaking process that is woven throughout government and is directly affected by the tensions created by separation of powers and federalism, no comprehensive national energy policy of any detail is likely to develop despite executive, legislative, or administrative desires to do so.<br/>There are ideological and pragmatic reasons behind this conclusion. The first reason, grounded <br/>AND<br/>through heavy central planning is simply not an accepted way of doing business.<br/>A second and corollary reason is that although government is used as a backstop to prevent large aggregations of corporate power, government will also promote and support competitive businesses. The New Deal was not so much an experiment in social policythough it was clearly that-as it was an example of the federal government stimulating the economy by getting business on its feet again.<br/>Third, there is a commitment to the hard energy path of largescale, high-technology, capital intensive energy production. This commitment finds its roots in the industrial revolution of the nineteenth century. This history makes it difficult for policy makers and decision makers to design and implement alternative energy policies, thus putting the burden of change on proponents ’of alternatives.<br/>Fourth, also echoing the liberal tradition, there is an underlying faith in the market. The country’s efforts to achieve the virtues of the market-color blindness, individual liberty, eqmility, and technological innovations-may not reach a Utopian plateau, but government controls are worse approximations. The country’s faith in the market forms the baseline, and government will only intervene if cracks in the baseline are perceived.<br/>Thus the dominant model of U.S. energy policy is firmly based in <br/>AND<br/>policy must be acknowledged. Hopefully, this article has provided that acknowledgement.</p><p>2AC clarifications are too late—the 1AC plan is used to generate counterplan competition—2AC or CX clarification justifies aff conditionality and kills any neg predictability</p></div></div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>03/29/2013</td><td style="width:100%; word-wrap:break-word;"><div><!--  <input type="image" onclick="deleteEntry('18', 'http://opencaselist.paperlessdebate.com/xwiki/rest/wikis/opencaselist/spaces/Emory/pages/Pesce-Sigalos Neg/objects/Admin.EntryClass/')" value="Delete" title="Delete" style="float:right;" src="/xwiki/resources/icons/silk/cross.gif" />

An expanded Democratic advantage in the Senate. A second-term President with his legacy on the line.<br/>Does all that add up to enough to break decades of impasse and produce comprehensive immigration reform? As expectations — and tensions — rise, the answer won’t be long in coming.<br/>A bipartisan bill could be filed in the Senate as early as next week, followed in relatively short order by a House bill, also crafted by a bipartisan group, aiming at a compromise on the key issue of citizenship.<br/>The efforts are being applauded by President Barack Obama, who is using every ounce of his political clout to try to get comprehensive reform.<br/>Obama said the time has come "to work up the political courage to do what’s required to be done."<br/>"I expect a bill to be put forward. I expect a debate to begin next month. I want to sign that bill into law as soon as possible," Obama said at a White House naturalization ceremony.<br/>In addition to the issue of eventual citizenship for 11 million undocumented immigrants, Congress is expected to address the need for temporary or guest worker programs.<br/>Congress last passed comprehensive bipartisan reform legislation in 1986, when President Ronald Reagan signed a law that granted citizenship to several million undocumented immigrants and created a guest worker program.<br/>Up until now, Republicans have opposed citizenship programs as an "amnesty" for lawbreakers who entered the country illegally, and labor has chafed at guest worker programs.<br/>But Republican losses in the 2012 elections and increased public support for reform have many in the GOP talking compromise.<br/>"If there is one issue that the two parties could produce something meaningful on in this Congress, it would be immigration," said Stephen Hess, a political expert at The Brookings Institution.<br/>Hess said an eventual bill "will have lots of provisos, and it will go back and forth, but it would be hard not to produce something given the general feeling that something has to be produced."<br/>More and more Republicans are moving toward immigration-reform measures as the party seeks to reach out to Latinos, the nation’s largest — and growing — minority voting bloc.<br/>Public opinion is behind them.<br/>A recent poll showed 63 percent of Americans supported a path to citizenship for undocumented workers provided they meet certain requirements, according to a survey by the Public Religion Research Institute.<br/>Notable Republicans who have recently spoken in favor of compromise on citizenship proposals include Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky.; former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour; and Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis.<br/>And a March report by the National Republican Committee, considered a "post mortem" on the 2012 elections, recommended the GOP embrace comprehensive immigration reform to shore up its shaky standing with minorities — Latinos, in particular.<br/>Roy Beck, executive director of Numbers USA, which advocates lower numerical numbers on immigration, predicted a majority of Republican senators would oppose citizenship.<br/>Groups like Numbers USA are working to hold GOP senators in line. They sent 13,000 emails to Kentucky voters that claimed Paul’s position was "more radical and pro-immigration than anything proposed by President Obama."<br/>The group has targeted Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., one of the "Gang of Eight" senators writing the Senate bipartisan bill, as a lawmaker who favors foreign workers over unemployed South Carolinians.<br/>Democrats from conservative-leaning states could also feel political heat.<br/>Beck said if five to 10 Democrats in the Senate oppose a bill, proponents would need 10 to 15 Republicans to reach the 60 votes needed to cut off debate and vote on legislation.<br/>"You do the math," Beck said.<br/>In 2007, an effort to cut off debate on a Senate immigration reform bill died on a 46-53 vote.<br/>But immigrant reform proponents, such as America’s Voice, say there is a "tectonic shift" in the GOP, and the Democrats also have expanded their Senate majority to 53-45, plus two independents who caucus with them. They predict the Senate will muster the votes necessary to pass a reform bill.<br/>Still, it won’t be easy.<br/>"We will have not only a few potholes, but a few near-death experiences along the way," said Frank Sharry, America’s Voice executive director.</p><p>Basic research is bipartisan, but government funding of applied energy research causes backlash.<br/>Washington Post, 6/4/2012.

Earlier this spring, the House Appropriations Energy and Water Subcommittee passed a bill for 2013 that would cut funding for energy R%26D by 27 percent.<br/>Created in 2007 under the America Competes Act with strong bipartisan support, the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, or ARPA-E, is modeled on the Pentagon’s highly successful DARPA program to help bridge the gap between research findings and the technological prototypes that could apply such breakthroughs to the real world. It’s a phase in innovation known as the "Valley of Death": the financing gap that can doom promising new technologies before they have a chance.<br/>Venture capital and angel investors from the private sector can and do step in. But policymakers for both parties have agreed that the federal government is particularly well suited to fund "high risk, high reward" ideas through ARPA-E—a mission that implicitly acknowledges that failure is naturally part of the process.<br/>ARPA-E’s early investments—ranging from high-powered lithium batteries to low-cost solar panels—have garnered praise from both sides, prompting calls to increase funding. The American Enterprise Institute, Brookings, and the Breakthrough Institute proposed a %241.5 billion annual budget for the agency in a 2010 report. Even the Heritage Foundation suggested a %24300 million budget for ARPA-E in 2012, in the same plan in which it proposed to dismantle the entire Department of Energy.<br/>Senate Republicans have similarly risen to ARPA-E’s defense in the face of proposed cuts. "We are now going to have to cut back somewhere… But we want to cut fat, not muscle and bone," Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) wrote in April 2011. "It is my belief that the work done by ARPA-E and the private-sector innovators will lead us into a world of improved, clean, reliable low-cost energy."<br/>But after an initial boost of stimulus funding in 2009—which helped tide the agency over into 2010—Congress has significantly pared back funding, and House Republicans want to push it down even further, proposing to cut the %24275 million budget in 2012 to %24200 million:<br/>Why have House Republicans soured on the program? Many believe the government should only <br/>AND<br/>also received private investment, which Republicans saw as proof of government waste.<br/>It’s the same rationale that Republicans have used in recanting their support for clean-energy loan programs in their attack on Solyndra. Such government loans are aimed at helping new technologies overcome the second "Valley of Death" from prototype to full-scale commercialization.<br/>Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, for example, supported such loans when he was governor of Massachusetts, personally delivering a %241.5 million check in 2003 to Konarka, a solar panel company that just went bankrupt. But on the campaign trail, he has attacked the %24535 million Solyndra loan as "crony capitalism" that gambled with taxpayers’ money to enrich Obama’s allies. By contrast, he has shared Obama’s call for more government spending on basic scientific research.<br/>In both cases — the attacks on Solyndra and the House ARPA-E budget-cutting — Republicans essentially want to narrow the role of government. Basic research is still kosher. But aggressive government forays into development should be discouraged.<br/>PC key. <br/><strong>The Atlantic 2/21/13</strong> ~There’s Reason to Be Optimistic About Congress—Seriously, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/02/theres-reason-to-be-optimistic-about-congress-seriously/273393/~~" tppabs="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/02/theres-reason-to-be-optimistic-about-congress-seriously/273393/~~"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/02/theres-reason-to-be-optimistic-about-congress-seriously/273393/~~</span></a></span></p><p>Nevertheless, this is a new congressional session, and Boren’s pessimism might possibly be <br/>AND<br/>not a fabric yet — but there are threads, and that’s encouraging."<br/>In today’s context, defining success is important — and requires a healthy dose of both skepticism and pragmatism. There’s little hope that this Congress can reverse the — exacerbated by, among other things, powerful special interests and partisan media — that has gripped Washington. The forces that drove Rep. Boren out of Congress remain potent, and the legislative atmosphere on Capitol Hill is still toxic.<br/>Instead of a long-term course correction, the question is whether Republican leaders in the House, President Obama, and Senate Democrats can facilitate a reprieve — if only to show the public that the institution is still functional. Cutting a deal with the broad backing of both parties isn’t a question so much of relieving those pressures as of learning to pass laws in spite of them.<br/>Favorable Conditions<br/>The makeup of the 113th Congress and the occupant of the White House make conditions riper for bipartisan legislation than at any time since President George W. Bush’s first years in office. Since then, Washington has been in the grip of one of two dynamics: Either one party has held Congress and the presidency, or one party, possessing limited power, has had little interest in passing consequential legislation.<br/>The latter was the case last session, when Republicans controlled only the House. In most cases, they used this chamber to approve legislation, such as Rep. Paul Ryan’s eponymous budget, that helped define the party’s agenda but had no chance of gaining approval in the Senate (much less withstanding a veto from the White House). They were trying to wait out a president whom they believed would be sent packing in 2013.<br/>Democrats were in a similar position from 2007 to 2009, when they controlled Congress <br/>AND<br/>backing of the other party — and by and large didn’t get it.<br/>This session is different. Neither party has unilateral control, and yet there is <br/>AND<br/>a slew of national security issues after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.<br/>But drawing comparisons to that period is difficult because of 9/11; and<br/>AND<br/>) to lesser-known achievements (such as raising the minimum wage).<br/>The similarity between that period and now extends beyond the split control of government. <br/>AND<br/>in a head-to-head matchup, according to preelection polls.<br/>Boehner’s Challenge<br/>Public opinion might once again be pulling against Republicans, burnt as they were by <br/>AND<br/>a president when the people at home are inclined to support the president."<br/>How much Obama’s broad popularity matters to most GOP House members is debatable. With many of the president’s supporters packed into heavily Democratic urban districts, most Republicans represent safely red districts. (In November, Mitt Romney won 227 congressional districts, a majority, despite losing by 4 percentage points in the national vote.)<br/>But Obama’s standing could weigh more heavily on House Speaker John Boehner and Majority Leader <br/>AND<br/>’" said John Breaux, the former longtime Democratic senator from Louisiana.<br/>The onus falls particularly hard on Boehner, whose struggles to control his conference are well documented. More than any other player in Washington, he will determine whether anything gets done this year. How he decides to proceed could rest on how frequently he’s willing to leave conservative colleagues out in the cold and, consequently, how far he’s willing to risk his speakership.<br/>The good of the party, and not his seat of power, propelled Boehner’s decision to bring the superstorm Sandy relief bill to a vote earlier this year, when it passed with just a minority of support from Republicans. That combination — Democrats and the moderate wing of the House GOP — is the pathway to enacting a sweeping set of bipartisan agreements.<br/>A week after the storm vote, a large bipartisan majority passed a three-month extension of the debt ceiling. "It is hard to see this Congress being viewed as a bipartisan one, but we have seen a glimmer of light on the recent bipartisan vote to extend the debt ceiling," said Ron Bonjean, a onetime aide to the Republican leadership.<br/>Obama’s Duty<br/>Maintaining that momentum in the House won’t be easy, and it could require Obama’s personal leadership. Getting Boehner to take such a perilous route could depend in large part on successful cajoling from the president. And on this subject — the relationships among Washington’s top leaders — discussion of a deal being cut becomes sharply pessimistic.</p><p>The impact is cyber terrorism. <br/>Reuters, 6/13/2012.

Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., center at the podium, has long advocated for the comprehensive immigration reform. In November 2012, the representative stood with members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and announced a declaration of nine principles for comprehensive immigration reform. Photo courtesy of Rep. Luis Gutierrez/Flickr.<br/>This week, the Republican National Committee, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky. and Speaker of the House John Boehner all have endorsed bipartisan work in Congress toward comprehensive immigration reform legislation.<br/>But Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., still worries.<br/>"I’m not sleeping because I’m thinking about what ~more~ needs to be done," said the 10-term Democratic congressman from Chicago. "There are other more nefarious forces out there."<br/>Gutierrez has made securing a path to citizenship for the estimated 11 million undocumented residents living in the U.S. — most of them Hispanic — a personal mission. Now that he’s closer than ever to the goal, he’s not letting up on his image as a tireless, vocal firebrand widely considered the preeminent voice for immigration reform in Congress.<br/>He’s led rallies against the deportation policies of President Barack Obama and challenged Mr. Obama and Democratic leaders who support immigration reform to push harder and faster for a comprehensive bill.<br/>But Gutierrez now says the November election may have done for the cause what all his years of hectoring the political class could not.<br/>"I said this before the election. Everybody said, what’s going to change, Luis? What’s going to change if we vote for Barack Obama? All these deportations, people getting arrested," Gutierrez said in an interview with PBS NewsHour. "I remember saying, oh, I’m working for Obama. I’m gonna make sure he gets elected because the victory is going to be so huge he’s going to be indebted to Latinos."<br/>Latinos voted overwhelmingly for the president and other Democrats, and that changed the calculus of Republicans as well, Gutierrez said. "That vote was so huge and numerous that Republicans, who had always wanted to either take this ~immigration reform~ off the table or — many more — who were our allies, our partners" could now support comprehensive reform, he said.<br/>Working closely with Republicans, as he did several years ago during the last run at comprehensive immigration reform, Gutierrez is part of a small group in Congress quietly fashioning a bill. It’s allowed the liberal former Chicago city council member to forge new bonds despite ideological differences.<br/>"There are a lot of wonderful personal relationships that are being developed across the aisle between people who politically have nothing else in common, who come to this issue, this ’public policy matter,’ ~they~ you would say, so that it would be drained of any emotion, right?—from a different perspective. I see it as a civil rights issue, as a human rights issue," Gutierrez said.<br/>As the economic, political, and practical advantages of immigration reform get voiced by <br/>AND<br/>revisit it now. We’re not gonna allow a permanent subclass of Americans."<br/>Predictions are that immigration bills in the House and Senate will be unveiled formally after next week’s Spring congressional recess. Legislation could arrive on the president’s desk before summer’s end.<br/>But some advocates worry something they can’t see now, such as the grassroots "anti-amnesty" movement that scuttled public opinion support for a law six years ago, could arise again.<br/>Gutierrez says it’s what keeps him from sleeping well.</p><p>B. despite skepticism and disagreements<br/><strong>IBT 3/22/13</strong>—International Business Tribune ~<span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../www.ibtimes.com/immigration-reform-bill-suddenly-close-what-made-republicans-change-their-minds-1145763~~" tppabs="http://www.ibtimes.com/immigration-reform-bill-suddenly-close-what-made-republicans-change-their-minds-1145763~~"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.ibtimes.com/immigration-reform-bill-suddenly-close-what-made-republicans-change-their-minds-1145763~~</span></a></span></p><p>When President Barack Obama called on Congress to send him an immigration bill "in the next few months" during his 2013 State of the Union address in January, many were skeptical that it would actually happen.<br/>By now it’s a tired trope that the obstructionist tactics of Republican legislators have left Washington sclerotic, all but unable to address many of the issues facing America as Obama begins his second term in the White House.<br/>But immigration reform is turning out to be one area of policy where action is happening, and experts on the issue say that a landmark law will likely be on the books by the end of this summer.<br/>"People want to get this done well before the August recess, and people are talking about before July 4," David Koelsch, an attorney and law professor who runs the Immigration Law Clinic at the University of Detroit Mercy, said. "A signing ceremony on the Fourth of July looks really good, there’s nice optics around that."<br/>It’s almost shocking at this point to see members of Congress from both sides of the aisle coming together to support a groundbreaking piece of important legislation.<br/>But that’s what’s happening as even Tea Party-backed Republicans like Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky are coming into the fold and endorsing a path to citizenship and other pillars of what is shaping up to be the framework for comprehensive immigration reform.<br/>There are still some differences between even the most centrist members of Congress that must be ironed out, but in most cases they are disagreements of scale and specifics, and a consensus about what to include in the bill is taking shape.</p><p>Hirsh (PC)<br/>2.

President Obama didn’t want to be seen as backing down. So Susan Rice — one of his most devoted aides since 2007 — gave him the way out, seemingly all on her own.<br/>"If nominated, I am now convinced that the confirmation process would be lengthy, disruptive, and costly — to you and to our most pressing national and international priorities," Rice wrote on Thursday in a letter withdrawing her name from consideration as secretary of State.<br/>In a statement in response, Obama said that "while I deeply regret the unfair and misleading attacks on Susan Rice in recent weeks," he "accepted her decision." He added that Rice will continue as his U.N. ambassador for the time being.<br/>This was all the part intended for public consumption. The underlying reality is this<br/>AND<br/>excoriating GOP attacks on her with unusual (for him) personal pique.<br/>But as the weeks passed, it became clearer that Rice’s biggest political problem was no longer just the klatch of Republican senators, led by John McCain, who were fiercely criticizing her for allegedly misleading statements on the attack at the U.S. consulate that killed U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans in Benghazi, Libya on Sept. 11.<br/>After a series of strikingly unsuccessful meetings on Capitol Hill in which she failed to <br/>AND<br/>supplying and financing a brutal Congolese rebel force known as the M23 Movement. <br/>That may have been the tipping point, though an official on Rice’s team declined to say so. As she put it herself in her letter to Obama, the president had some other "pressing national international priorities.… It is far more important that we devote precious legislative hours and energy to enacting your core goals, including comprehensive immigration reform, balanced deficit reduction, job creation, and maintaining a robust national defense and effective U.S. global leadership."<br/>In other words, the Obama team was quickly coming to realize that, even though it appeared he had considerable leverage over the Republicans following a more-robust-than-thought reelection victory, a Rice nomination was simply going to cost him too much political capital, especially when it came to a long-term budget deal.</p><p>6.

But a review of a wide cross-section of polling conducted over the last few months suggests it’s too early to declare Obama the honeymoon over just yet.<br/>Here’s the bottom line: There are data points that should worry the president and his top advisers. But across the board, his numbers haven’t exactly dive-bombed.<br/>There are two polls that that have shown signs of trouble for the president:</p><ul><li>Obama’s approval rating &nbsp;(45 percent) in a Quinnipiac University survey released Thursday was virtually unchanged from his approval rating a month ago (46 percent). But it is down from early December, when 53 percent of voters approved of the job the president was doing, a month after his re-election win.</li><li>According to Gallup, which tracks Obama’s approval rating among Americans based on a three-day rolling average, Obama’s number is now hovering around the high 40s, down from the low 50s where it stood in the months leading up to last week’s failure to avert the deep federal spending cuts known as sequestration.<br/>How do those numbers stack up against the rest of the post-election polling that has been conducted? Obama’s job approval rating hasn’t dropped as severely in other surveys:<br/>So what does this all suggest? A couple of things. For starters, <br/>AND<br/>with Congressional Republicans, the fights haven’t done serious damage to his brand.<br/>It’s important to note that the outcome of the first fiscal battle, over the <br/>AND<br/>post-sequester coverage has focused on how Obama’s warnings haven’t come true.<br/>Aside from Obama’s approval rating, there is some data that suggest signs of trouble for Obama coming out of the sequestration standoff. A CBS News poll showed nearly as many Americans blamed him (33 percent) as blamed Congressional Republicans (38 percent) for failure to avert the cuts. And last month’s NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll found only 32 percent said the country is headed in right direction, down from 41 percent in December.<br/>As the Fix boss wrote in this space about a month ago, the lengths of post-reelection political honeymoons have grown shorter and shorter in recent years (Gallup has a comprehensive study here). Obama, who has a very ambitious legislative agenda right now, is hoping to be the exception to that trend. We’ll find out in the coming months if he can pull that off or not.</li></ul><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h3 id="HAT:Guns" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>AT: Guns</span></h3><p>Guns don’t thump immigration<br/><strong>Kayyem 1/21</strong> ~Juliette, columnist for Boston Globe, Action on guns and immigration needed, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../bostonglobe.com/opinion/2013/01/21/president-obama-has-opportunities-guns-immigration/uRCngtyVOuJ51De55A8HyK/story.html~~" tppabs="http://bostonglobe.com/opinion/2013/01/21/president-obama-has-opportunities-guns-immigration/uRCngtyVOuJ51De55A8HyK/story.html~~"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://bostonglobe.com/opinion/2013/01/21/president-obama-has-opportunities-guns-immigration/uRCngtyVOuJ51De55A8HyK/story.html~~</span></a></span></p><p>Neither immigration nor gun control had a significant place in Obama’s first-term agenda<br/>AND<br/>level Republican leaders aiming for 2016, such as Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>Economy<br/>No fiscal thumpers—immigration central focus—bipart key<br/>USA TODAY 3/22/13 <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2013/03/21/budget-congress-recess-immigration-guns/2006219/index.htm" tppabs="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2013/03/21/budget-congress-recess-immigration-guns/2006219/"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2013/03/21/budget-congress-recess-immigration-guns/2006219/</span></a></span></p><p>A brief reprieve in the fiscal battles between President Obama and a divided Congress will allow two contentious and politically divisive domestic issues — guns and immigration — to take center stage in the national debate this spring.<br/>The ability for Washington to find solutions to either issue will require the kind of bipartisan cooperation and common ground the president and congressional leaders have been unable to find on the budget.<br/>In other words: It won’t be easy.<br/>The push to strengthen the nation’s gun laws has been fueled by public pressure for legislative action in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in Newtown, Conn., that left 20 schoolchildren and six educators dead.<br/>Renewed interest in overhauling the nation’s immigration laws, and how or whether to create a path to citizenship for about 11 million undocumented residents, was sparked after the election in 2012 saw Hispanic voters siding with Obama over the GOP by 3-to-1.<br/>Congress will turn to both issues this spring after approving competing budget resolutions and a short-term spending bill this week to avert a government shutdown through Sept. 30.

President Obama made the same argument in his 2012 State of the Union address, giving almost complete credit for hydraulic fracturing to Uncle Sam:<br/>The development of natural gas will create jobs and power trucks and factories that are <br/>AND<br/>support is critical in helping businesses get new energy ideas off the ground.<br/>Nordhaus and Shellenberger come down unequivocally on the president’s side of this argument:<br/>In fact, virtually all subsequent commercial fracturing technologies have been built upon the basic understanding of hydraulic fracturing first demonstrated by the Department of Energy in the 1970s.<br/>They also suggest that the same approach will foster the development of renewable energies such as wind and solar power:<br/>Indeed, once we acknowledge the shale gas case as a government success, not a failure, it offers a powerful basis for reforming present clean energy investments and subsidies.<br/>This argument is a direct contravention of the conventional wisdom that while government has a legitimate and valuable role in basic science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) research, it is a lousy venture capitalist and is largely incapable of picking winning technologies in the market.<br/>Critics of the government’s claim of credit argue, in essence, that the government <br/>AND<br/>that the increases came from state and private, not federal, lands.<br/>But for argument’s sake, let’s stipulate to the premise that hydraulic fracturing technology represents a great government success. What can we learn from this shining example?<br/>Not much, for two reasons:<br/>1) One winning game does not a champion make. Nordhaus and Shellenberger take the fracking example in isolation, and ignore persuasive literature showing that "industrial policy" (the formal term for government picking winners and losers) has a history of abject failure. Some, such as Terence Kealey at the University of Buckingham, point out that Japan’s efforts at industrial policy (through an agency called MITI) were simply a disaster:<br/>MITI, far from being a uniquely brilliant leader of government/industrial partnership, <br/>AND<br/>and the oil to make its unwanted steel. (p.111)<br/>Kealey points to a comprehensive study of MITI interventions between 1955 and 1990, observing that:<br/>Richard Beason of Alberta University and David Weinterin of Harvard showed that, across the 13 major sectors of the economy, surveying hundreds of different companies, Japan’s bureaucrats almost invariably picked and supported the losers. (p.111)<br/>As Obama’s own economic adviser Larry Summers pointed out, the government is a bad <br/>AND<br/>Based on the evidence, the latter is more likely than the former.<br/>2) Displacement is not addition. Studies show that government "investment" in applied research and development does not add new money to the pot, it displaces private capital, and does so disproportionally. When government steps in, it displaces more money than it throws in the pot.<br/>Again, Kealey sums it up well using a study by the OECD:<br/>Furthermore, regressions including separate variables for business-performed R%26D and that <br/>AND<br/>R%26D and the interaction between them. (p.19)<br/>Kealey’s own research agrees:<br/>Moreover, the OECD does not stand alone: at least two other researchers, Walter Park of the Department of Economics at the American University at Washington, D.C., and myself, have found—by similar surveys of OECD data—similarly damaging effects of the government funding of research and development.<br/>It’s a unique case turn—VC is jumpstarting fusion commercialization now.<br/>NPR, 11/9/2011.

Governments have spent many billions of dollars to develop that energy source, fusion energy, but it’s still a distant dream. Now a few upstart companies are trying to do it on the cheap. And the ideas are credible enough to attract serious private investment.<br/>One such company is hidden away in a small business park in the suburbs of Vancouver, British Columbia. Nothing seems unusual here — there’s a food distributor, an engineering firm and small warehouses. But on one door there’s a sign suggesting that all is not normal.<br/>The sign says "General Fusion" and warns people with pacemakers to proceed with caution.<br/>The reason for that caution can be found behind bulletproof walls that surround an experimental machine. This gleaming metal structure could be out of a science fiction movie set. It stands 15 feet tall, is crisscrossed with wires and is covered with aluminum foil. Two men are hunched over an instrument, troubleshooting.<br/>The machine is flanked with banks of electrical capacitors, which hold — and release — the amount of energy you find in a stick of dynamite. A siren warns to stay clear: The system is charging up, and with all that electric charge, some piece of hardware could go flying.<br/>This plasma ray gun is part of a bigger instrument, which is still under construction. The goal, simply put, is to create a small piece of the sun and harness that energy.<br/>"This is an insanely ambitious project," says Michel Laberge, the brains behind the project. He’s a physicist and inventor with a rusty beard and a college-casual wardrobe.<br/>Beating The Big Guys<br/>This story really starts a dozen years ago, when the company where he was working asked him to join in a hot technology race that had nothing to do with energy. He was asked to build a switch for fiber optics communication cables.<br/>"So I was in competition with Nortel, Bell Lab, Lucent," Laberge says. "All those guys were putting literally billions of dollars in this project. And they gave me half a million dollars, and one guy ... said, ’Do something that will work better than the other guy.’ ~And I said,~ ’Oh, OK%21’ "<br/>As Laberge tells the story, he actually succeeded.<br/>"For half a million dollars, we beat the billion-dollars worth of work. So that inflated my head a little bit. I said, ’Hey, look at that. You can beat the big guy if you do something different.’ "<br/>So, on his 40th birthday, he quit his job in what he calls a midlife crisis, took the pile of money he’d earned at his old company, and decided to try something really revolutionary. With his Ph.D. in fusion energy, he thought he’d try to beat the big boys in the fusion field.<br/>"Reason No. 1 is to save the planet. We are in deep poo-poo," Laberge says.<br/>Fossil fuels will run out, and in the meantime they are causing global warming. Among the allures is that fusion reactors can’t melt down, and they don’t produce significant nuclear waste. And Laberge says if he succeeds, he could be worth billions.<br/>"As for glory, I word that as a negative. I don’t want glory. That’s just a pain. I don’t want anybody to know me, really. Not interested in the glory. I’ll take the money, though," he says with a hearty laugh.<br/>He knew he couldn’t beat the existing multibillion-dollar fusion labs at their own game. So instead, he decided to combine ideas from the two current approaches to make a vastly cheaper machine.<br/>A One-Two Punch<br/>The general principle behind fusion is simple. If you can fuse together light atoms, you can create a heavier atom plus lots of energy. The trick is that in order to fuse atoms together, you need to provide enough energy to heat the atoms up to 150 million degrees Celsius.<br/>"Other fusion uses a very complex way of producing energy — superconducting magnets, laser beams, all sorts of expensive and complicated and pricey stuff," he says. "It costs them billions and billions of dollars, so it’s not so practical in my opinion. Here, what the energy source is, is compressed air. Compressed air is dirt cheap."<br/>Think of his idea as a one-two punch. His big electrical gizmo starts to heat up the atoms. Those get injected into a 10-foot-wide sphere full of swirling molten lead.<br/>"The liquid will be circulated with a pump, so it spins around and makes a vortex in the center. You know, like your toilet with a hole in the center," Laberge says.<br/>And just as the heated atoms get into the center, Laberge fires 200 pistons, powered with compressed air, which surround the sphere. "Those are compressed air guns ... that send a big compression wave, squash the thing, and away you go%21"<br/>If all goes as planned, squashing the mixture heats it up enough to fuse the atoms and ignite nuclear reactions.<br/>The concept is called magnetized target fusion. Laberge didn’t invent the idea, but he re-imagined it, and, more to the point, he raised %2430 million from Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos and several venture capital firms to see if he can get it off the ground.<br/>Ask Laberge if he thinks it will work, and you’ll get an indignant reply: "Of course I think it’s going to work%21 Do you think I’m going to spend 10 years of my life doing something I think won’t work? I think it ~has~ a good shot of working."<br/>He adds, "I wouldn’t say I’m 100 percent sure it’s going to work<br/>AND<br/>, this is making power for the whole planet. This is huge%21"<br/>Changing The Venture Capital Game<br/>And the physics concept isn’t the only big idea here: Laberge is also pioneering the idea that venture capital firms, which are used to taking big gambles but expect a quick payback, can sometimes have the patience to invest in a project they can’t just flip in three years. Private funding could change the game for fusion energy.<br/>Richard Siemon used to run the fusion program at Los Alamos National Laboratory, which <br/>AND<br/>’ that’s sort of like a non-issue for a government researcher."<br/>But private investors are only interested in projects that could become commercially viable power sources. That’s why Siemon is happy to see private investors taking an interest in fusion energy.<br/>"I really think that venture capital might just come in at this point and pick the best fruits off the tree and run with them," says the retired physicist.<br/>In fact, Laberge’s company is not the only one out there using private funds to build reactors based on magnetized target fusion and other novel concepts. Siemon says he’s confident someone will eventually figure this out. And that may be an economic competitor.</p><h2 id="H2A2NC" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span><strong>* 2NC</strong></span></h2><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h3 id="HAT:PlanDoesn2019tPickWinners28Nelson1229" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>AT: Plan Doesn’t Pick Winners (Nelson 12)</span></h3><p>Private funding is better suited to find the designs that will actually translate well to market.

The new "Big Data R%26D Initiative", for instance, will put %24200 million into commitments for applied tools and techniques in biomedical research.<br/>And while it’s certainly exciting to see federal funds go towards translational research, it <br/>AND<br/>grant recipients are academic labs with not a single startup or commercial partner.<br/>As an entrepreneur myself, this brings up a series of concerns:<br/>Quality: Will the resulting products of these grants be useful? In my experience, startups are simply more efficient at translating ’needs’ to products. Because they operate on commercial incentives, startups are better at iterating to ensure their software development efforts fit their customer’s needs. In comparison, academic labs seem divorced from the end user, and have less willingness and/or incentive to engage in lean customer development processes.<br/>Sustainability: Will the funded efforts actually be sustainable? Startups, as opposed to <br/>AND<br/>. Consequently they are more often reliant on continuous government funding for longevity.<br/>Unfair / illegal competition: Existing startups such as NextBio and SolveBio are already developing solutions to large-scale applied data analysis. It would seem that some of the recent grants will fund efforts that essentially duplicate the work of these startups. Is this is really the best use of federal funds? Is it even legal given the federal government shouldn’t provide or support a service which can be procured through ordinary business channels?<br/>A pointed case study is that of an %2412.2 million ARRA grant<br/>AND<br/>who by contrast must optimize best practices to compete and ensure applied outcomes.<br/>Rather than focusing on exclusive support for academic labs, the NIH and NHGRI should <br/>AND<br/>21 million SBIR for instance, which has since become an industry standard.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h3 id="H2NCInnovationNB" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>2NC Innovation NB</span></h3><p>Dependence on government funding for applied research undermines innovation and decreases likelihood of commercialization—micro-economic studies prove.<br/>Yaichi Aoshima, Kazunari Matsushima, and Manabu Eto, February 2011.

In a declaration of faith in the power of the undiscovered, he committed his administration to increasing expenditure on research, bringing it above 3 per cent of U.S. GDP. (The figure for Canada is about 1.8 per cent).<br/>Noteworthy was his espousal of basic science. U.S. funding agencies’ expenditures on it will double, whereas Canada’s granting bodies for basic science have recently been cut by more than %24145-million over three years.<br/>"Basic scientific research," Mr. Obama said, quoting Vannevar Bush, "<br/>AND<br/>they will lower their buckets into the well until they come up dry.<br/>What basic research consists in - done right - is the systematic advancement of understanding of the physical world. This is done largely in universities, since it embodies the experience that students should share. Together, our students and our basic research represent an investment in our future.<br/>Mr. Obama’s central message to his countrymen is to invest in the long term, to behave as if they have a future. In Canada, favoured as we are, we find this hard.<br/>But the rewards for timidity are modest. Directing basic research to applied goals, as we do through numerous university-industry partnerships, is a flawed operation. Sometimes it works. This is the case when the links between new knowledge and its applications are clear. But if apparent to the bureaucracy, they are also apparent to others. The likelihood of stealing a march on the rest of the world is correspondingly small.<br/>Substantial technological innovations are less easy to link to the new ideas that make them possible. These are, of course, the technologies that governments in their roseate dreams hope to encourage by selecting "relevant" basic science.<br/>Mr. Obama’s advisers might recall that, in 1937, the same National Academy of Sciences was charged with making a study of emerging technologies. It reported that the major growth areas in applied science would be found in novel means of farming, in manufacturing synthetic gasoline and in the introduction of synthetic replacements for natural rubber.<br/>They had rightly grasped that there was a coming crisis in resource availability. What they overlooked - understandably, since the clues were hidden among so many others - was the imminent emergence of nuclear energy, antibiotics, jet aircraft, space travel and computers.<br/>These powerful technologies emerged because the new opportunities thrown up by basic science were seized, not because the basic science itself was targeted. Quite the contrary - it was freedom of inquiry in basic research that permitted far-reaching new concepts to flower. These then led, from the bottom up, to ground-breaking technologies.<br/>It is an abiding mystery why, having failed so definitively to pick winners in the marketplace for goods, governments have been empowered to pick winners in the far more subtle marketplace for ideas.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h3 id="H2NCVCSolvesNow" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>2NC VC Solves Now</span></h3><p>Government-backed fusion projects consistently fall behind schedule—a new wave of privately funded companies are leveraging venture capital and are likely to achieve commercialization faster. <br/>Mark Halper, 1/28/2013.

And they certainly stand a chance of licking Lawson.<br/>THE FUSION ENTREPRENEURS <br/>But what has gone largely unnoticed in the shadows of these giants is that a <br/>AND<br/>will get at least one or two of the little ones there first.<br/>Each of them is working on considerably smaller fusion contraptions than the 20-story "tokamak" building that will rise at Cadarache and the 10-story tall, 3-football field long facility housing 192 lasers that each zig zag their way nearly a mile to hit a tiny target of hydrogen isotopes in Livermore.<br/>And each (I mention only some below) is developing its own particular take on fusion.<br/>Two of the startups, Tri-Alpha Energy of Irvine, Calif. and Lawrenceville Plasma Physics(LPP) of Middlesex, New Jersey, are working on a technology &nbsp;called "aneutronic" fusion that directly creates electricity. Other approaches to fusion use the heat of hot neutrons released in the reaction to drive a turbine. Aneutronic fusions tends to use fuel that differs from the deuterium and tritium (both hydrogen isotopes) of "conventional" fusion. Rather, it tends to use regular hydrogen and boron.<br/>One thing that distinguishes LPP is its collaborative approach – it is boldly reaching out to Iran, a world leader in aneutronic fusion research, to jointly develop this peaceful form of nuclear power in an initiative that LPP president Eric Lerner calls Fusion for Peace.<br/>And when I think of what sets Tri-Alpha &nbsp;- a stealth company – apart from the others, I think of funding. It has received over %24140 million in venture funds, including tranches from Goldman Sachs, Venrock, Vulcan Capital New Enterprise Associates, and reportedly from Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen.<br/>FUSION AND THE OIL INDUSTRY<br/>Another fusion startup that has venture backing – about %2432 million last time I counted – is General Fusion of Burnaby, Canada, near Vancouver.

We need to increase the number of students we graduate in STEM by focusing on participation of underrepresented populations, like women and minorities, and by teaching STEM in new ways that engage students.<br/>The prerequisite for accomplishing this mandate requires a significant improvement in the math competency of all students, but especially for women and students from underserved communities. We have to make the learning social, contextual, and relevant for these students. New instructional methodologies and innovative use of technologies can be a major tool in accomplishing this mandate.<br/>Flipped classes and blended learning, where students watch online videos offered through companies like EdX and then participate in classroom discussion, are one way to use technology in higher education. Such a blended model helps students learn at their own pace before coming to the class and creates more peer-to-peer learning opportunities.<br/>Fixing a Broken Funding Model<br/>Another factor is contributing to the lack of STEM graduates: the poor funding model for higher education.<br/>Affordable higher education is becoming available to fewer people. Research from the National Center for Education Statistics and the National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education shows an alarming trend of dramatically diminished state support for public higher education. Our public universities and colleges have increased tuition and fees and reduced administrative costs, but these efforts are not enough.</p><p>No terrorist threat to the US – death of bin Laden shifted attack priorities<br/>Mahadevan 3-22 ~Prem, senior researcher at the Center for Security Studies, "The Glocalisation of Al Qaedaism," <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../www.isn.ethz.ch/isn/Digital-Library/Articles/Special-Feature/Detail/-lng=en&id=161729&contextid774=161729&contextid775=161659&tabid=1454211886~~" tppabs="http://www.isn.ethz.ch/isn/Digital-Library/Articles/Special-Feature/Detail/?lng=en%26id=161729%26contextid774=161729%26contextid775=161659%26tabid=1454211886~~"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.isn.ethz.ch/isn/Digital-Library/Articles/Special-Feature/Detail/?lng=en%26id=161729%26contextid774=161729%26contextid775=161659%26tabid=1454211886~~</span></a></span><br/>This leads to the second develop­ment which has boosted Al Qaeda’s ideology locally<br/>AND<br/>Zawahiri’s empha­sis on attacking the ’near enemy’ has gained impetus.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div></div></div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>03/29/2013</td><td style="width:100%; word-wrap:break-word;"><div><!--  <input type="image" onclick="deleteEntry('23', 'http://opencaselist.paperlessdebate.com/xwiki/rest/wikis/opencaselist/spaces/Emory/pages/Pesce-Sigalos Neg/objects/Admin.EntryClass/')" value="Delete" title="Delete" style="float:right;" src="/xwiki/resources/icons/silk/cross.gif" />

After my experience in fusion research and many other energy technologies, I feel that I’ve learned where we might look for practical fusion power. &nbsp;Part of that learning comes from where practical fusion power is not likely to be found.<br/>Fusion is not like fire, although some fusion researchers seem to think so. &nbsp;Fire became a major source of energy for early humankind, partly because it provided special capabilities, and it had essentially no competition. &nbsp;Also, there were no cost or environmental issues to be concerned with when humans discovered fire and learned to use it. &nbsp;Fire worked; it was convenient, and it did wonderful things when measured by then-existing lifestyles.<br/>Fusion research started after World War II at a time when it was felt that science had wonderful things to provide for humankind. &nbsp;The potential cost of fusion power was not an issue. &nbsp;The wonders of the atom, or more properly the nucleus, were felt to be unbounded. &nbsp;Fusion was the fundamental energy source in the universe, powering the sun and the stars. &nbsp;Wonders awaited.<br/>Many outstanding people turned to the pursuit of fusion power. &nbsp;A number of fusion concepts emerged and were investigated. &nbsp;Soon it became painfully clear that practical fusion power would not happen quickly. &nbsp;First, we had to develop the science of plasma physics.<br/>After decades of effort, a great deal has been learned and accomplished, but a practical fusion power concept has not been forthcoming. &nbsp;Note that I said "practical fusion power." &nbsp;Unlike fire, fusion power has to compete against a number of other options. &nbsp;The word "practical" means that a fusion power system must be desirable, based on the realities of the society into which it will be introduced.<br/>An unfortunate problem today is that many people in fusion research believe that producing a fusion-something that simply works is the goal, but that is definitely wrong%21 &nbsp;Fusion power and fire are distinctly different.<br/>Let’s consider some specific criteria for practical fusion power. &nbsp;In 1994, the U.S. Electric Power Research Institute – EPRI – convened a panel of utility technologists to develop "Criteria for Practical Fusion Power <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../login/XWiki/fi001454.-srid=dybaiznk" tppabs="http://opencaselist.paperlessdebate.com/xwiki/wiki/opencaselist/Emory/Systems-http://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02213958."><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">Systems-http://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02213958.</span></a></span>" The result was a four-page folder that outlined "Three principal types of criteria:"<br/>Economics,<br/>Public Acceptance, and<br/>Regulatory Simplicity.<br/>The criteria are almost self-explanatory, but let me quote from the Economics Criteria: &nbsp;"To compensate for the higher economic risks associated with new technologies, fusion plants must have lower lifecycle costs than competing technologies available at the time of commercialization." &nbsp;Details for the criteria are given in the report, which I commend to anyone motivated to help develop fusion power.<br/>Against these criteria, let’s consider tokamak fusion, the centerpiece of which is ITER – the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor – under construction in France. &nbsp;As we know, it’s an enormously large machine, which is generally considered to be a prototype of a practical fusion power plant.<br/>Comparing the ITER and the core of a comparable commercial fission reactor shows an enormous difference in size – a factor of 5-10 — ITER being huge by comparison to a fission reactor core.<br/>It is known in engineering and technology development that the cost of a finished machine or product is roughly proportional to the mass of the device. &nbsp;Eyeballing ITER compared to a fission reactor core, it’s obvious that an ITER-like machine is many times more massive. &nbsp;Yes, you can argue details, like the hollow bore of a tokamak, but the size of the huge superconducting magnets and their heavy support structures provides no relief.<br/>Bottom line – On the face of it, an ITER-like power system will be much more expensive than a comparable fission reactor, so I believe that tokamak fusion loses big-time on cost, independent of details.<br/>Next, consider the fact that deuterium-tritium fusion inherently emits copious neutrons, which will induce significant radioactivity in adjacent tokamak structural and moderating materials. &nbsp;Accordingly, a tokamak power system will become highly radioactive as soon as it begins to operate and, over time, radiation damage will render those same materials structurally weak, requiring replacement.<br/>In the U.S., as elsewhere in the world, we have a Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which will almost certainly be given the task of ensuring that the public is safe from mishaps associated with tokamak power system failures. &nbsp;Expected regulation will require all kinds of safety features, which will add further costs to tokamak power.<br/>While the character of the plasma in a tokamak power reactor will not likely represent <br/>AND<br/>situation where the magnets go normal, releasing very large amounts of energy.<br/>Accordingly, it is virtually certain that the regulators will demand a containment building for a commercial tokamak reactor that will likely resemble what is currently required for fission reactors, so as to protect the public from normal-going superconducting magnet energy release. &nbsp;Because an ITER-like tokamak reactor is inherently so large, such a building will be extremely expensive, further increasing the costs of something that is already too expensive.<br/>Next, there’s the induced radioactivity in the structure and moderator of a tokamak power <br/>AND<br/>to cost, along with an added difficulty for industry to deal with.<br/>No matter what materials are chosen, there will still be neutron-induced materials <br/>AND<br/>materials being transported around the country. &nbsp;Remember the criteria of public acceptance.<br/>I could go on with other downsides and showstoppers associated with tokamak fusion power, but I won’t. &nbsp;It is enough to say that tokamak fusion power has what I believe are insurmountable barriers to practicability and acceptability.<br/>By the way, my arguments assume that tokamak physics and technology works well and is reasonably simple, meaning that not many more components will have to be added to the system to allow it to operate on a steady basis for very long periods of time between the long shutdowns needed to change out radiation-damaged, radioactive materials.<br/>What I’ve just described is not a happy story. &nbsp;At some point, probably in a matter of years, a group of pragmatic power industry engineers will be convened to seriously scrutinize tokamak fusion, and they are virtually certain to declare that it cannot become a practical power system</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>. That will certainly be a calamity for the people involved and for the cause of fusion power.<br/>Let’s review what I’ve said. &nbsp;First, we have to recognize that practical fusion power must measure up to or be superior to the competition in the electric power industry. &nbsp;Second, it is virtually certain that tokamak fusion as represented by ITER will not be practical.<br/>So where are we likely to find practical fusion power? &nbsp;First, we must look for a concept or concepts that are inherently small in size, which means high plasma density. &nbsp;Second, we must look for something that can be based on a low or zero neutron fusion reaction. &nbsp;One example is the proton-boron reaction.<br/>We know some things about proton-boron fusion. &nbsp;First it requires much higher temperatures that deuterium-tritium. &nbsp;Second, it cannot be based on a Maxwellian plasma particle distribution, because theory tells us that the plasma radiation losses (Bremsstrahlung) from a very high temperature, Maxwellian, proton-boron plasma will kill the concept.<br/>That means that a proton-boron plasma must be non-Maxwellian, and it must be fashioned in such a way that normal inter-particle scattering reactions can be managed on an on-going basis.<br/>For this audience, the requirements for practical fusion power sound like they could be <br/>AND<br/>but wonder if IEC just might be the key to practical fusion power.<br/>In conclusion, in the early days of the U.S. fusion research, the program was classified secret and called Project Sherwood. &nbsp;One explanation for that name was, if it works, it sure would be wonderful.<br/>I hope that you and others will be able to help make it happen.<br/>Thank you.<br/>PS. &nbsp;These thoughts were painful to formulate. &nbsp;As a past leader of the U.S. federal fusion program, I played a significant role in establishing tokamak research to the U.S., and I had high hopes for its success. &nbsp;Realities have emerged to dash those hopes. &nbsp;When we learn unpleasant things, it is incumbent on us to speak up, even when it hurts.</p></div></div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>03/30/2013</td><td style="width:100%; word-wrap:break-word;"><div><!--  <input type="image" onclick="deleteEntry('24', 'http://opencaselist.paperlessdebate.com/xwiki/rest/wikis/opencaselist/spaces/Emory/pages/Pesce-Sigalos Neg/objects/Admin.EntryClass/')" value="Delete" title="Delete" style="float:right;" src="/xwiki/resources/icons/silk/cross.gif" />

Rather than promising never to use nuclear weapons first, these proponents advocate that the United States pledge not to initiate the use of “weapons of mass destruction,” by which they mean chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons.<br/>However, chemical weapons do not belong in this category—their destructive capacity pales <br/>AND<br/>the incentive such a policy would provide hostile nations to acquire nuclear weapons.<br/>Advocates of an explicit U.S. nuclear threat often claim that such a threat deterred Iraq’s use of chemical and biological weapons during the first Gulf War. However, President George H.W. Bush’s threat of “the strongest possible response” if Iraq used its chemical or biological weapons applied equally to the destruction of Kuwait’s oil fields, which Iraq did with impunity.34<br/>U.S. officials threatened privately to escalate the war in ways that did <br/>AND<br/>U.S. threats to use nuclear weapons were the determining factor.<br/>Nuclear threats are also unnecessary to deter non-nuclear attacks because U.S<br/>AND<br/>it has not done so, in part because of just such considerations.<br/>Threatening to use nuclear weapons in response to non-nuclear attacks could also increase <br/>AND<br/>, even if they believed that doing so would be unnecessary or imprudent.<br/>The bottom line is that the marginal value of explicit threats to use nuclear weapons to respond to non-nuclear attacks is small, the wisdom of carrying out such threats is dubious, and the potential long-term security costs of making such threats is &nbsp;&nbsp;great.

There would be no nuclear weapons. As we move toward that vision, the United States should view its nuclear weapons for one purpose and one purpose only—to deter the use of nuclear weapons by others.

He and his acolytes proselytise the case for Australia to get IFRs. &nbsp;This latest enthusiasm seems to have been inspired by Britain’s present crisis of nuclear waste.<br/>Britain had, and still has, nearly 100 metric tonnes of weapons grade plutonium<br/>AND<br/>for some reason, the Cumbrians are not very keen on the idea…<br/>So, along come the nuclear entrepreneur whiz kids.<br/>Why not have another try at turning toxic wastes into a profitable export, they <br/>AND<br/>stockpile of plutonium in GEH’s Prism fast reactors”. It’s a complicated process.<br/>Now, doesn’t that sound good?<br/>It would get rid of Britain’s massive amount of plutonium wastes, make it (almost) unsuitable for weapons, make money for UK, and give cheap electricity to the colonials, hmm… say, in Australia! Yep, Barry Brook and his crew think that this is a great idea for Australia.<br/>What’s wrong with this?<br/>Lots.<br/>First of all, I always think “follow the money”. Because of various factors, these reactors will be hugely expensive to build. The construction materials have to be especially tough and durable because of obvious – and non-obvious – safety concerns. The PRISM reactor is cooled by liquid sodium, which can very readily catch fire. They are kept as small reactors, to make it easier to maintain safety features.<br/>Apart from the high costs of building these reactors, because they are small, they would not be economic to sell except in large numbers; they need to be pretty well mass produced to make them viable for export. Bearing in mind that they still exist only as blueprints — it will be a very long stretch until somebody (in Australia?) places an order for them in large numbers.<br/>The Integral Fast Reactor is, after all, just another type of nuclear reactor <br/>AND<br/>reactor is costing 1,000 times more than conventional reactors to run.<br/>Beyond all that, there is the safety factor, mentioned briefly before. The metal fuel gets hot and, unlike oxide based fuels, when it heats, it swells. If the fuel expands too much, it can crack the surrounding cladding — and that presents a big problem.<br/>And just as safety impinges on costs, so does security. These small nuclear reactors have to be guarded, and so does the plutonium and enriched uranium fuel being transported to the reactor. And so do the eventual radioactive wastes produced by the IFRs. Security alone would be a huge expense — and more so because it would involve guarding not just a few big reactors, but a large number of small ones.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>1NC—China<br/>Egypt won't nuclearize<br/>Coleman 12 Colonel Matthew, "Iran Goes Nuclear: Predictive Responses to a Wicked Problem," 3-22, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc-AD=ADA561094" tppabs="http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA561094"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA561094</span></a></span><br/> <br/>Although Egypt views a nuclear-armed Iran as an existential threat, it is <br/>AND<br/>in the world and continue their quest toward peace in the Middle East.<br/>No impact to cyber attack<br/>Green 2 Joshua, Editor, Washington Monthly, “The Myth of Cyberterrorism”, November, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2001/0211.green.html" tppabs="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2001/0211.green.html"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2001/0211.green.html</span></a></span></p><p>When ordinary people imagine cyberterrorism, they tend to think along Hollywood plot lines, <br/>AND<br/>as PDAs, BlackBerrys, and even wireless or infrared copiers and faxes.<br/>No resource wars. <br/>Salehyan 8—Professor of Political Science at North Texas Idean, Journal of Peace Research, “From Climate Change to Conflict?

But the most basic question has hardly been examined: Would America really fight a war with China over the islands?<br/>As with so many issues in East Asia, Washington clearly wishes the dispute would just go away—or at least away from American officials’ desks.

In short, even a modestly liberal reading of American commitments lends fuel to the Chinese and Japanese fires both.<br/>It is simple to understand why Beijing and Tokyo are so exercised about the uninhabited islands.

Not just any old WMDs but nuclear weapons − the most destructive, indiscriminate and immoral of all weapons.<br/>Integral fast reactors<br/>Integral fast reactors (IFRs) are reactors proposed to be fuelled with a metallic <br/>AND<br/>long-lived waste products into shorter-lived, less problematic wastes).<br/>IFRs would breed their own fuel (plutonium-239) from uranium-238 <br/>AND<br/>the few alternative uses for depleted uranium − hardening munitions − is objectionable.<br/>Pyroprocessing technology would be used − it would not separate pure plutonium suitable for direct <br/>AND<br/>-lived waste radioisotopes to convert them into shorter-lived waste products.<br/>In short, IFRs could produce lots of greenhouse-friendly energy and while they're <br/>AND<br/>paper. For it only gets ugly in moving from blueprint to backyard."<br/>Complete IFR systems don't exist. Fast neutron reactors exist but experience is limited and they have had a troubled history. The pyroprocessing and waste transmutation technologies intended to operate as part of IFR systems are some distance from being mature. But even if the technologies were fully developed and successfully integrated, IFRs would still fail a crucial test − they can too easily be used to produce fissile materials for nuclear weapons.<br/>IFRs and nuclear weapons<br/>George Stanford, who worked on an IFR RandD program in the US, notes that proliferators "could do with IFRs what they could do with any other reactor − operate it on a special cycle to produce good quality weapons material."<br/>As with conventional reactors, IFRs can be used to produce weapon grade plutonium in the fuel (using a shorter-than-usual irradiation time) or by irradiating a uranium or depleted uranium 'blanket' or targets. Conventional PUREX reprocessing can be used to separate the plutonium. Another option is to separate reactor grade plutonium from IFR fuel and to use that in weapons instead of weapon grade plutonium.<br/>The debate isn't helped by the muddle-headed inaccuracies of some IFR advocates, <br/>AND<br/>weapon grade plutonium, IFRs can produce weapon grade plutonium. Go figure.<br/>Presumably Brook's point is that IFR-produced plutonium cannot be separated on-site from irradiated materials (fuel/blanket/targets); it would need to be separated from irradiated materials at a separate reprocessing plant. If so, it is a banal point which also applies to conventional reactors, and it remains the case that IFRs can certainly produce weapon grade plutonium.<br/>Brooks' HSHVHSORFs are conventional PUREX plants − technology which is well within the reach of <br/>AND<br/>sort of techniques as extracting it from spent fuel from light water reactors."<br/>IFR advocates propose using them to draw down global stockpiles of fissile material, whether <br/>AND<br/>amount to over 270 tonnes, enough for 27,000 nuclear weapons.</p><p>IFRs makes nuclear terrorism inevitable<br/>Gallucci, President of the MacArthur Foundation, 11—president of the John D. and Catherine T.

The disaster at Fukushima could just as well have been the result of a deliberate attack. An attacker would only have needed to know the weaknesses in facility design and operation in order to put the fuel and reactor cores at risk. This logic also applies to theft and diversion.<br/>For more than a decade, American presidents have said that the greatest threat confronting our country is that a terrorist will detonate a nuclear device in one of our cities.<br/>Some say this is farfetched. I am convinced it is perfectly feasible, a risk low in probability but high in consequence.<br/>Terrorists would have a hard time getting their hands on a ready-made nuclear <br/>AND<br/>might be by the standards of the designers at Livermore or Los Alamos.<br/>The consequences of either device would be catastrophic. A bomb on the scale of Hiroshima could kill a quarter of a million people in a major city. A smaller device could kill tens of thousands over several weeks. The economic and political costs would be incalculable.<br/>The biggest impediment to making a nuclear weapon is getting the fissile material, either highly enriched uranium or plutonium.<br/>So our objective in addressing the security risks of nuclear power is simple: make sure that terrorists cannot get their hands on fissile material from the nuclear fuel cycle.<br/>I would argue that we need to carefully control enrichment technology, because it can be used to produce HEU; and we need to stop the spread of reprocessing technology because it does produce plutonium.<br/>There is a debate over whether spent fuel reprocessing is a prudent or irrational way to manage radioactive waste and conserve uranium, from both economic and technical points of view. I take the latter view.<br/>My reasoning (I have discovered that foundations call this a "logic model"):<br/>The more fissile material there is available, the more likely it is that an IND will be manufactured and an act of nuclear terrorism will occur.<br/>If energy producers choose to recycle plutonium in thermal reactors, it will be impossible adequately to account for plutonium in the nuclear fuel cycle. The risk of theft or diversion would rise.<br/>The introduction of mixed oxide (MOX) fuel into any country's nuclear fuel cycle increases the risk that plutonium will be acquired by a would-be nuclear terrorist.<br/>So any nation thinking about recycling plutonium needs to be aware of, and take account of, the additional risk of nuclear terrorism.<br/>In my view, there is nothing to be won by the introduction of plutonium fuels into the nuclear fuel cycle that is not substantially off-set by an increased risk to security.<br/>If we eliminate the possibility of terrorists obtaining fissile material, we eliminate most of the risk of a nuclear terrorist attack.<br/>So, as we think about the security risks and begin to assess how to minimize them going forward, our priority should be to end the recycle of plutonium and the use of mixed oxide fuel. If separated plutonium exists, it can be stolen from a storage or fuel-fabrication facility, a nuclear reactor, or in transport.<br/>In my opinion there is no acceptable reprocessing technology – not COEX, not UREX+, not pyroprocessing. If a mixed oxide fuel can be used in a thermal reactor, it can also be used directly to make an improvised nuclear device, or be purified by a determined terrorist sufficiently to be used in such a device.<br/>So I do not buy the arguments made for plutonium recycle in the U.S., China, India, the Republic of Korea, and beyond. The claim is that recycle would facilitate radioactive waste management, save uranium and SWUs, and prepare the way for fast reactors.<br/>American proponents even argue it would help the U.S. regain technical credibility and international leadership in nuclear energy.<br/>It is not at all clear that recycle will ease radioactive waste management. Indeed, it may well exacerbate the challenge. Moreover, safe spent-fuel storage is at hand in dry storage – local or off-site – good, arguably, for hundreds of years.<br/>The economic arguments for recycle, which depend on the price of uranium and the cost of enrichment and reprocessing, are weak and have gotten weaker over time.<br/>And the large scale adoption of fast reactors is hardly inevitable – or even likely for a very long time.<br/>I have told the Blue Ribbon Commission, a U.S. panel investigating storage options for nuclear waste, that it is folly to argue for a recycle approach. It is politically risky, economically unwise, and technically unnecessary. The only remaining argument is that the U.S. needs to be an industry leader. But it is a poor leader that persuades others to go in precisely the wrong direction.<br/>Instead, the U.S. should argue that the risks of plutonium recycle <br/>AND<br/>in persuading China, Korea, Japan, and others not to recycle.</p><p>No widespread prolif<br/>Hymans 12—Jacques E.

And Mr. Barak repeatedly warned that because of Israel’s more limited military capabilities, its own window of opportunity to carry out an effective strike was closing.<br/>It has appeared that Mr. Barak has drifted away from Mr. Netanyahu in recent months, sounding more conciliatory toward the Obama administration, but even the prime minister has become less antagonistic.<br/>The Pentagon declined to comment on The Daily Beast report, but a senior defense official said, “The U.S. military constantly plans for a range of contingencies we might face around the world, and our planning is often quite detailed.” The official added, “That shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone.”<br/>In recent years, Mr. Barak and Mr. Netanyahu had become increasingly alarmed as Iran moved forward with a nuclear program that it says is solely for peaceful purposes, but that Israel, the United States and others believe is geared toward producing a bomb. The two men consistently emphasized Israel’s doctrine of self-reliance for such existential issues.<br/>But faced with tough opposition from Washington and public criticism from a string of former Israeli security chiefs, the prospect of an imminent unilateral Israeli strike receded in recent months.<br/>In the past few weeks Mr. Netanyahu campaigned for re-election in Israel as a strong leader who, among other things, had managed to persuade the world to deal with the Iranian threat.<br/>Mr. Netanyahu and his conservative Likud Party emerged weakened from the elections, with much of the Israeli electorate more focused on domestic issues. In a speech after the voting, he said, “The first challenge was and still is to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.” But he did not again threaten to go it alone.</p><p>No terrorist threat to the US – death of bin Laden shifted attack priorities<br/>Mahadevan 3-22 Prem, senior researcher at the Center for Security Studies, “The Glocalisation of Al Qaedaism,” <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../www.isn.ethz.ch/isn/Digital-Library/Articles/Special-Feature/Detail/-lng=enandid=161729andcontextid774=161729andcontextid775=161659andtabid=1454211886" tppabs="http://www.isn.ethz.ch/isn/Digital-Library/Articles/Special-Feature/Detail/?lng=enandid=161729andcontextid774=161729andcontextid775=161659andtabid=1454211886"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.isn.ethz.ch/isn/Digital-Library/Articles/Special-Feature/Detail/?lng=enandid=161729andcontextid774=161729andcontextid775=161659andtabid=1454211886</span></a></span><br/>This leads to the second develop­ment which has boosted Al Qaeda’s ideology locally<br/>AND<br/>Zawahiri’s empha­sis on attacking the ‘near enemy’ has gained impetus.</p><p>1NC Warming<br/>IFRs too slow to solve warming—development time and sodium fires.<br/>Clarke 10—Renfrey Clarke is an Australian writer, a climate change activist, and member of the Socialist Alliance in Adelaide, South Australia April 8, 2010, “Why James Hansen is wrong on nuclear power,” International Journal of Socialist Renewal, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../links.org.au/node/1607" tppabs="http://links.org.au/node/1607"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://links.org.au/node/1607</span></a></span></p><p>When a technology is immature – as is the case with third-generation nuclear power generation – the time needed to make it fully operational is always an important question. And when the task is to replace fossil-fuelled energy generation, the timeframes for perfecting the new equipment and building it out are critically short.<br/>Just how short emerges from work performed by James Hansen himself. If a basically recognisable natural world is to survive, the US climatologist has concluded, atmospheric carbon dioxide must be cut by the end of the century to a level below 350 parts per million (ppm). This will require ending net human-induced CO2 emissions by 2050.<br/>How much CO2 can be emitted during this period, if the eventual concentration of 350 ppm is to be achieved? Other scientists have calculated the allowable “carbon budget” for the years until 2050 at a total of 420 gigatonnes (billion tonnes) of CO2, with other greenhouse gases in proportion. At present emission rates, this budget will be exhausted around 2021.<br/>How might third- and fourth-generation nuclear plants fit these requirements? Highly complex, and still unproven, third-generation plants would not be operating in significant numbers before 2020, and probably for rather longer. This is indicated by experience with the plant now being built at Olkiluoto in Finland. Construction at the site is at least three and a half years behind schedule, and is plagued by cost overruns of some 60 per cent.<br/>Compared to earlier installations, the projected fourth-generation plants – specifically, the <br/>AND<br/>. Fresh mining of uranium would not be needed for hundreds of years.<br/>Along with plutonium, the reactor products from IFRs would contain highly radioactive isotopes of <br/>AND<br/>. Its attractiveness as a basis for weapons proliferation would arguably be slight.<br/>High-level wastes from other reactors could also be incorporated into the IFR fuel, to be “burned” and transmuted into relatively manageable materials. The wastes left behind after the fuel extraction would initially be dangerous – and quite usable for dirty bombs – but within 200 years would be no more radioactive than natural uranium ores.<br/>Energy bonanza?<br/>Through the use of IFRs, proponents like Hansen maintain, huge quantities of energy could be created without major emissions of greenhouse gases. Meanwhile, the costs and dangers of uranium mining and enrichment would be avoided. With plutonium and highly radioactive wastes never leaving the reactor sites, security would be easier to manage. From being a massive obstacle, end-product waste storage would become quite feasible.<br/>Unfortunately, IFRs do not offer a solution to global warming. The catch, above all, is in the time lines. There is simply no way that IFRs can be designed, brought to practical operating status and built in massive numbers during the few years – barely a decade, if something like today’s natural world is to survive – that the greenhouse emissions budget allows us.<br/>Developing workable IFRs would not be straightforward or quick, even if massive resources were <br/>AND<br/>breakdowns, and are fiendishly difficult and time consuming to service and repair.<br/>Needing to maintain high neutron energy levels, fast reactors cannot use water as a coolant, since this would slow the neutrons down. The coolant of choice is molten sodium metal. Sodium is highly reactive, burning readily in air and exploding on contact with water. If leaks are not to result in sodium-air fires, the reactor vessel and coolant pipes must be surrounded with inert argon gas, adding to complexity and costs. At a certain point, the sodium coolant must be used for steam generation; here, it is separated from high-pressure water by only a thin barrier of pipe metal, any flaw in which can have drastic consequences.<br/>The sodium that passes through the reactor core becomes highly radioactive. This means that <br/>AND<br/>prevent fires. Even minor malfunctions can result in months of down time.<br/>Sodium fires<br/>Between 1980 and 1997, Russia’s BN-600 fast reactor experienced 27 leaks, <br/>AND<br/>, actual as compared to designed output – of just 7 per cent.<br/>The development of IFRs, if it goes ahead, will be expensive, difficult and prolonged. Wikipedia predicts a commercialisation date for fourth-generation nuclear plants of 2030.

He and his acolytes proselytise the case for Australia to get IFRs. &nbsp;This latest enthusiasm seems to have been inspired by Britain’s present crisis of nuclear waste.<br/>Britain had, and still has, nearly 100 metric tonnes of weapons grade plutonium<br/>AND<br/>for some reason, the Cumbrians are not very keen on the idea…<br/>So, along come the nuclear entrepreneur whiz kids.<br/>Why not have another try at turning toxic wastes into a profitable export, they <br/>AND<br/>stockpile of plutonium in GEH’s Prism fast reactors”. It’s a complicated process.<br/>Now, doesn’t that sound good?<br/>It would get rid of Britain’s massive amount of plutonium wastes, make it (almost) unsuitable for weapons, make money for UK, and give cheap electricity to the colonials, hmm… say, in Australia! Yep, Barry Brook and his crew think that this is a great idea for Australia.<br/>What’s wrong with this?<br/>Lots.<br/>First of all, I always think “follow the money”. Because of various factors, these reactors will be hugely expensive to build. The construction materials have to be especially tough and durable because of obvious – and non-obvious – safety concerns. The PRISM reactor is cooled by liquid sodium, which can very readily catch fire. They are kept as small reactors, to make it easier to maintain safety features.<br/>Apart from the high costs of building these reactors, because they are small, they would not be economic to sell except in large numbers; they need to be pretty well mass produced to make them viable for export. Bearing in mind that they still exist only as blueprints — it will be a very long stretch until somebody (in Australia?) places an order for them in large numbers.<br/>The Integral Fast Reactor is, after all, just another type of nuclear reactor <br/>AND<br/>reactor is costing 1,000 times more than conventional reactors to run.<br/>Beyond all that, there is the safety factor, mentioned briefly before. The metal fuel gets hot and, unlike oxide based fuels, when it heats, it swells. If the fuel expands too much, it can crack the surrounding cladding — and that presents a big problem.<br/>And just as safety impinges on costs, so does security. These small nuclear reactors have to be guarded, and so does the plutonium and enriched uranium fuel being transported to the reactor. And so do the eventual radioactive wastes produced by the IFRs. Security alone would be a huge expense — and more so because it would involve guarding not just a few big reactors, but a large number of small ones.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>1NC—China<br/>Egypt won't nuclearize<br/>Coleman 12 Colonel Matthew, "Iran Goes Nuclear: Predictive Responses to a Wicked Problem," 3-22, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc-AD=ADA561094" tppabs="http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA561094"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA561094</span></a></span><br/> <br/>Although Egypt views a nuclear-armed Iran as an existential threat, it is <br/>AND<br/>in the world and continue their quest toward peace in the Middle East.<br/>No impact to cyber attack<br/>Green 2 Joshua, Editor, Washington Monthly, “The Myth of Cyberterrorism”, November, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2001/0211.green.html" tppabs="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2001/0211.green.html"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2001/0211.green.html</span></a></span></p><p>When ordinary people imagine cyberterrorism, they tend to think along Hollywood plot lines, <br/>AND<br/>as PDAs, BlackBerrys, and even wireless or infrared copiers and faxes.<br/>No resource wars. <br/>Salehyan 8—Professor of Political Science at North Texas Idean, Journal of Peace Research, “From Climate Change to Conflict?

Not just any old WMDs but nuclear weapons − the most destructive, indiscriminate and immoral of all weapons.<br/>Integral fast reactors<br/>Integral fast reactors (IFRs) are reactors proposed to be fuelled with a metallic <br/>AND<br/>long-lived waste products into shorter-lived, less problematic wastes).<br/>IFRs would breed their own fuel (plutonium-239) from uranium-238 <br/>AND<br/>the few alternative uses for depleted uranium − hardening munitions − is objectionable.<br/>Pyroprocessing technology would be used − it would not separate pure plutonium suitable for direct <br/>AND<br/>-lived waste radioisotopes to convert them into shorter-lived waste products.<br/>In short, IFRs could produce lots of greenhouse-friendly energy and while they're <br/>AND<br/>paper. For it only gets ugly in moving from blueprint to backyard."<br/>Complete IFR systems don't exist. Fast neutron reactors exist but experience is limited and they have had a troubled history. The pyroprocessing and waste transmutation technologies intended to operate as part of IFR systems are some distance from being mature. But even if the technologies were fully developed and successfully integrated, IFRs would still fail a crucial test − they can too easily be used to produce fissile materials for nuclear weapons.<br/>IFRs and nuclear weapons<br/>George Stanford, who worked on an IFR RandD program in the US, notes that proliferators "could do with IFRs what they could do with any other reactor − operate it on a special cycle to produce good quality weapons material."<br/>As with conventional reactors, IFRs can be used to produce weapon grade plutonium in the fuel (using a shorter-than-usual irradiation time) or by irradiating a uranium or depleted uranium 'blanket' or targets. Conventional PUREX reprocessing can be used to separate the plutonium. Another option is to separate reactor grade plutonium from IFR fuel and to use that in weapons instead of weapon grade plutonium.<br/>The debate isn't helped by the muddle-headed inaccuracies of some IFR advocates, <br/>AND<br/>weapon grade plutonium, IFRs can produce weapon grade plutonium. Go figure.<br/>Presumably Brook's point is that IFR-produced plutonium cannot be separated on-site from irradiated materials (fuel/blanket/targets); it would need to be separated from irradiated materials at a separate reprocessing plant. If so, it is a banal point which also applies to conventional reactors, and it remains the case that IFRs can certainly produce weapon grade plutonium.<br/>Brooks' HSHVHSORFs are conventional PUREX plants − technology which is well within the reach of <br/>AND<br/>sort of techniques as extracting it from spent fuel from light water reactors."<br/>IFR advocates propose using them to draw down global stockpiles of fissile material, whether <br/>AND<br/>amount to over 270 tonnes, enough for 27,000 nuclear weapons.</p><p>IFRs makes nuclear terrorism inevitable<br/>Gallucci, President of the MacArthur Foundation, 11—president of the John D. and Catherine T.

The disaster at Fukushima could just as well have been the result of a deliberate attack. An attacker would only have needed to know the weaknesses in facility design and operation in order to put the fuel and reactor cores at risk. This logic also applies to theft and diversion.<br/>For more than a decade, American presidents have said that the greatest threat confronting our country is that a terrorist will detonate a nuclear device in one of our cities.<br/>Some say this is farfetched. I am convinced it is perfectly feasible, a risk low in probability but high in consequence.<br/>Terrorists would have a hard time getting their hands on a ready-made nuclear <br/>AND<br/>might be by the standards of the designers at Livermore or Los Alamos.<br/>The consequences of either device would be catastrophic. A bomb on the scale of Hiroshima could kill a quarter of a million people in a major city. A smaller device could kill tens of thousands over several weeks. The economic and political costs would be incalculable.<br/>The biggest impediment to making a nuclear weapon is getting the fissile material, either highly enriched uranium or plutonium.<br/>So our objective in addressing the security risks of nuclear power is simple: make sure that terrorists cannot get their hands on fissile material from the nuclear fuel cycle.<br/>I would argue that we need to carefully control enrichment technology, because it can be used to produce HEU; and we need to stop the spread of reprocessing technology because it does produce plutonium.<br/>There is a debate over whether spent fuel reprocessing is a prudent or irrational way to manage radioactive waste and conserve uranium, from both economic and technical points of view. I take the latter view.<br/>My reasoning (I have discovered that foundations call this a "logic model"):<br/>The more fissile material there is available, the more likely it is that an IND will be manufactured and an act of nuclear terrorism will occur.<br/>If energy producers choose to recycle plutonium in thermal reactors, it will be impossible adequately to account for plutonium in the nuclear fuel cycle. The risk of theft or diversion would rise.<br/>The introduction of mixed oxide (MOX) fuel into any country's nuclear fuel cycle increases the risk that plutonium will be acquired by a would-be nuclear terrorist.<br/>So any nation thinking about recycling plutonium needs to be aware of, and take account of, the additional risk of nuclear terrorism.<br/>In my view, there is nothing to be won by the introduction of plutonium fuels into the nuclear fuel cycle that is not substantially off-set by an increased risk to security.<br/>If we eliminate the possibility of terrorists obtaining fissile material, we eliminate most of the risk of a nuclear terrorist attack.<br/>So, as we think about the security risks and begin to assess how to minimize them going forward, our priority should be to end the recycle of plutonium and the use of mixed oxide fuel. If separated plutonium exists, it can be stolen from a storage or fuel-fabrication facility, a nuclear reactor, or in transport.<br/>In my opinion there is no acceptable reprocessing technology – not COEX, not UREX+, not pyroprocessing. If a mixed oxide fuel can be used in a thermal reactor, it can also be used directly to make an improvised nuclear device, or be purified by a determined terrorist sufficiently to be used in such a device.<br/>So I do not buy the arguments made for plutonium recycle in the U.S., China, India, the Republic of Korea, and beyond. The claim is that recycle would facilitate radioactive waste management, save uranium and SWUs, and prepare the way for fast reactors.<br/>American proponents even argue it would help the U.S. regain technical credibility and international leadership in nuclear energy.<br/>It is not at all clear that recycle will ease radioactive waste management. Indeed, it may well exacerbate the challenge. Moreover, safe spent-fuel storage is at hand in dry storage – local or off-site – good, arguably, for hundreds of years.<br/>The economic arguments for recycle, which depend on the price of uranium and the cost of enrichment and reprocessing, are weak and have gotten weaker over time.<br/>And the large scale adoption of fast reactors is hardly inevitable – or even likely for a very long time.<br/>I have told the Blue Ribbon Commission, a U.S. panel investigating storage options for nuclear waste, that it is folly to argue for a recycle approach. It is politically risky, economically unwise, and technically unnecessary. The only remaining argument is that the U.S. needs to be an industry leader. But it is a poor leader that persuades others to go in precisely the wrong direction.<br/>Instead, the U.S. should argue that the risks of plutonium recycle <br/>AND<br/>in persuading China, Korea, Japan, and others not to recycle.</p><p>No widespread prolif<br/>Hymans 12—Jacques E.

And Mr. Barak repeatedly warned that because of Israel’s more limited military capabilities, its own window of opportunity to carry out an effective strike was closing.<br/>It has appeared that Mr. Barak has drifted away from Mr. Netanyahu in recent months, sounding more conciliatory toward the Obama administration, but even the prime minister has become less antagonistic.<br/>The Pentagon declined to comment on The Daily Beast report, but a senior defense official said, “The U.S. military constantly plans for a range of contingencies we might face around the world, and our planning is often quite detailed.” The official added, “That shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone.”<br/>In recent years, Mr. Barak and Mr. Netanyahu had become increasingly alarmed as Iran moved forward with a nuclear program that it says is solely for peaceful purposes, but that Israel, the United States and others believe is geared toward producing a bomb. The two men consistently emphasized Israel’s doctrine of self-reliance for such existential issues.<br/>But faced with tough opposition from Washington and public criticism from a string of former Israeli security chiefs, the prospect of an imminent unilateral Israeli strike receded in recent months.<br/>In the past few weeks Mr. Netanyahu campaigned for re-election in Israel as a strong leader who, among other things, had managed to persuade the world to deal with the Iranian threat.<br/>Mr. Netanyahu and his conservative Likud Party emerged weakened from the elections, with much of the Israeli electorate more focused on domestic issues. In a speech after the voting, he said, “The first challenge was and still is to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.” But he did not again threaten to go it alone.</p><p>No terrorist threat to the US – death of bin Laden shifted attack priorities<br/>Mahadevan 3-22 Prem, senior researcher at the Center for Security Studies, “The Glocalisation of Al Qaedaism,” <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../www.isn.ethz.ch/isn/Digital-Library/Articles/Special-Feature/Detail/-lng=enandid=161729andcontextid774=161729andcontextid775=161659andtabid=1454211886" tppabs="http://www.isn.ethz.ch/isn/Digital-Library/Articles/Special-Feature/Detail/?lng=enandid=161729andcontextid774=161729andcontextid775=161659andtabid=1454211886"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.isn.ethz.ch/isn/Digital-Library/Articles/Special-Feature/Detail/?lng=enandid=161729andcontextid774=161729andcontextid775=161659andtabid=1454211886</span></a></span><br/>This leads to the second develop­ment which has boosted Al Qaeda’s ideology locally<br/>AND<br/>Zawahiri’s empha­sis on attacking the ‘near enemy’ has gained impetus.</p><p>1NC Warming<br/>IFRs too slow to solve warming—development time and sodium fires.<br/>Clarke 10—Renfrey Clarke is an Australian writer, a climate change activist, and member of the Socialist Alliance in Adelaide, South Australia April 8, 2010, “Why James Hansen is wrong on nuclear power,” International Journal of Socialist Renewal, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../links.org.au/node/1607" tppabs="http://links.org.au/node/1607"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://links.org.au/node/1607</span></a></span></p><p>When a technology is immature – as is the case with third-generation nuclear power generation – the time needed to make it fully operational is always an important question. And when the task is to replace fossil-fuelled energy generation, the timeframes for perfecting the new equipment and building it out are critically short.<br/>Just how short emerges from work performed by James Hansen himself. If a basically recognisable natural world is to survive, the US climatologist has concluded, atmospheric carbon dioxide must be cut by the end of the century to a level below 350 parts per million (ppm). This will require ending net human-induced CO2 emissions by 2050.<br/>How much CO2 can be emitted during this period, if the eventual concentration of 350 ppm is to be achieved? Other scientists have calculated the allowable “carbon budget” for the years until 2050 at a total of 420 gigatonnes (billion tonnes) of CO2, with other greenhouse gases in proportion. At present emission rates, this budget will be exhausted around 2021.<br/>How might third- and fourth-generation nuclear plants fit these requirements? Highly complex, and still unproven, third-generation plants would not be operating in significant numbers before 2020, and probably for rather longer. This is indicated by experience with the plant now being built at Olkiluoto in Finland. Construction at the site is at least three and a half years behind schedule, and is plagued by cost overruns of some 60 per cent.<br/>Compared to earlier installations, the projected fourth-generation plants – specifically, the <br/>AND<br/>. Fresh mining of uranium would not be needed for hundreds of years.<br/>Along with plutonium, the reactor products from IFRs would contain highly radioactive isotopes of <br/>AND<br/>. Its attractiveness as a basis for weapons proliferation would arguably be slight.<br/>High-level wastes from other reactors could also be incorporated into the IFR fuel, to be “burned” and transmuted into relatively manageable materials. The wastes left behind after the fuel extraction would initially be dangerous – and quite usable for dirty bombs – but within 200 years would be no more radioactive than natural uranium ores.<br/>Energy bonanza?<br/>Through the use of IFRs, proponents like Hansen maintain, huge quantities of energy could be created without major emissions of greenhouse gases. Meanwhile, the costs and dangers of uranium mining and enrichment would be avoided. With plutonium and highly radioactive wastes never leaving the reactor sites, security would be easier to manage. From being a massive obstacle, end-product waste storage would become quite feasible.<br/>Unfortunately, IFRs do not offer a solution to global warming. The catch, above all, is in the time lines. There is simply no way that IFRs can be designed, brought to practical operating status and built in massive numbers during the few years – barely a decade, if something like today’s natural world is to survive – that the greenhouse emissions budget allows us.<br/>Developing workable IFRs would not be straightforward or quick, even if massive resources were <br/>AND<br/>breakdowns, and are fiendishly difficult and time consuming to service and repair.<br/>Needing to maintain high neutron energy levels, fast reactors cannot use water as a coolant, since this would slow the neutrons down. The coolant of choice is molten sodium metal. Sodium is highly reactive, burning readily in air and exploding on contact with water. If leaks are not to result in sodium-air fires, the reactor vessel and coolant pipes must be surrounded with inert argon gas, adding to complexity and costs. At a certain point, the sodium coolant must be used for steam generation; here, it is separated from high-pressure water by only a thin barrier of pipe metal, any flaw in which can have drastic consequences.<br/>The sodium that passes through the reactor core becomes highly radioactive. This means that <br/>AND<br/>prevent fires. Even minor malfunctions can result in months of down time.<br/>Sodium fires<br/>Between 1980 and 1997, Russia’s BN-600 fast reactor experienced 27 leaks, <br/>AND<br/>, actual as compared to designed output – of just 7 per cent.<br/>The development of IFRs, if it goes ahead, will be expensive, difficult and prolonged.

An expanded Democratic advantage in the Senate. A second-term President with his legacy on the line.<br/>Does all that add up to enough to break decades of impasse and produce comprehensive immigration reform? As expectations -- and tensions -- rise, the answer won't be long in coming.<br/>A bipartisan bill could be filed in the Senate as early as next week, followed in relatively short order by a House bill, also crafted by a bipartisan group, aiming at a compromise on the key issue of citizenship.<br/>The efforts are being applauded by President Barack Obama, who is using every ounce of his political clout to try to get comprehensive reform.<br/>Obama said the time has come "to work up the political courage to do what's required to be done."<br/>"I expect a bill to be put forward. I expect a debate to begin next month. I want to sign that bill into law as soon as possible," Obama said at a White House naturalization ceremony.<br/>In addition to the issue of eventual citizenship for 11 million undocumented immigrants, Congress is expected to address the need for temporary or guest worker programs.<br/>Congress last passed comprehensive bipartisan reform legislation in 1986, when President Ronald Reagan signed a law that granted citizenship to several million undocumented immigrants and created a guest worker program.<br/>Up until now, Republicans have opposed citizenship programs as an "amnesty" for lawbreakers who entered the country illegally, and labor has chafed at guest worker programs.<br/>But Republican losses in the 2012 elections and increased public support for reform have many in the GOP talking compromise.<br/>"If there is one issue that the two parties could produce something meaningful on in this Congress, it would be immigration," said Stephen Hess, a political expert at The Brookings Institution.<br/>Hess said an eventual bill "will have lots of provisos, and it will go back and forth, but it would be hard not to produce something given the general feeling that something has to be produced."<br/>More and more Republicans are moving toward immigration-reform measures as the party seeks to reach out to Latinos, the nation's largest -- and growing -- minority voting bloc.<br/>Public opinion is behind them.<br/>A recent poll showed 63 percent of Americans supported a path to citizenship for undocumented workers provided they meet certain requirements, according to a survey by the Public Religion Research Institute.<br/>Notable Republicans who have recently spoken in favor of compromise on citizenship proposals include Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky.; former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour; and Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis.<br/>And a March report by the National Republican Committee, considered a "post mortem" on the 2012 elections, recommended the GOP embrace comprehensive immigration reform to shore up its shaky standing with minorities -- Latinos, in particular.<br/>Roy Beck, executive director of Numbers USA, which advocates lower numerical numbers on immigration, predicted a majority of Republican senators would oppose citizenship.<br/>Groups like Numbers USA are working to hold GOP senators in line. They sent 13,000 emails to Kentucky voters that claimed Paul's position was "more radical and pro-immigration than anything proposed by President Obama."<br/>The group has targeted Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., one of the "Gang of Eight" senators writing the Senate bipartisan bill, as a lawmaker who favors foreign workers over unemployed South Carolinians.<br/>Democrats from conservative-leaning states could also feel political heat.<br/>Beck said if five to 10 Democrats in the Senate oppose a bill, proponents would need 10 to 15 Republicans to reach the 60 votes needed to cut off debate and vote on legislation.<br/>"You do the math," Beck said.<br/>In 2007, an effort to cut off debate on a Senate immigration reform bill died on a 46-53 vote.<br/>But immigrant reform proponents, such as America's Voice, say there is a "tectonic shift" in the GOP, and the Democrats also have expanded their Senate majority to 53-45, plus two independents who caucus with them. They predict the Senate will muster the votes necessary to pass a reform bill.<br/>Still, it won't be easy.<br/>"We will have not only a few potholes, but a few near-death experiences along the way," said Frank Sharry, America's Voice executive director.<br/>PC key.<br/>The Atlantic 2/21/13 There's Reason to Be Optimistic About Congress—Seriously, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/02/theres-reason-to-be-optimistic-about-congress-seriously/273393/index.htm" tppabs="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/02/theres-reason-to-be-optimistic-about-congress-seriously/273393/"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/02/theres-reason-to-be-optimistic-about-congress-seriously/273393/</span></a></span></p><p>Nevertheless, this is a new congressional session, and Boren's pessimism might possibly be <br/>AND<br/>not a fabric yet -- but there are threads, and that's encouraging."<br/>In today's context, defining success is important -- and requires a healthy dose of both skepticism and pragmatism. There's little hope that this Congress can reverse the -- exacerbated by, among other things, powerful special interests and partisan media -- that has gripped Washington. The forces that drove Rep. Boren out of Congress remain potent, and the legislative atmosphere on Capitol Hill is still toxic.<br/>Instead of a long-term course correction, the question is whether Republican leaders in the House, President Obama, and Senate Democrats can facilitate a reprieve -- if only to show the public that the institution is still functional. Cutting a deal with the broad backing of both parties isn't a question so much of relieving those pressures as of learning to pass laws in spite of them.<br/>Favorable Conditions<br/>The makeup of the 113th Congress and the occupant of the White House make conditions riper for bipartisan legislation than at any time since President George W. Bush's first years in office. Since then, Washington has been in the grip of one of two dynamics: Either one party has held Congress and the presidency, or one party, possessing limited power, has had little interest in passing consequential legislation.<br/>The latter was the case last session, when Republicans controlled only the House. In most cases, they used this chamber to approve legislation, such as Rep. Paul Ryan's eponymous budget, that helped define the party's agenda but had no chance of gaining approval in the Senate (much less withstanding a veto from the White House). They were trying to wait out a president whom they believed would be sent packing in 2013.<br/>Democrats were in a similar position from 2007 to 2009, when they controlled Congress <br/>AND<br/>backing of the other party -- and by and large didn't get it.<br/>This session is different. Neither party has unilateral control, and yet there is <br/>AND<br/>a slew of national security issues after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.<br/>But drawing comparisons to that period is difficult because of 9/11; and<br/>AND<br/>) to lesser-known achievements (such as raising the minimum wage).<br/>The similarity between that period and now extends beyond the split control of government. <br/>AND<br/>in a head-to-head matchup, according to preelection polls.<br/>Boehner's Challenge<br/>Public opinion might once again be pulling against Republicans, burnt as they were by <br/>AND<br/>a president when the people at home are inclined to support the president."<br/>How much Obama's broad popularity matters to most GOP House members is debatable. With many of the president's supporters packed into heavily Democratic urban districts, most Republicans represent safely red districts. (In November, Mitt Romney won 227 congressional districts, a majority, despite losing by 4 percentage points in the national vote.)<br/>But Obama's standing could weigh more heavily on House Speaker John Boehner and Majority Leader <br/>AND<br/>'" said John Breaux, the former longtime Democratic senator from Louisiana.<br/>The onus falls particularly hard on Boehner, whose struggles to control his conference are well documented. More than any other player in Washington, he will determine whether anything gets done this year. How he decides to proceed could rest on how frequently he's willing to leave conservative colleagues out in the cold and, consequently, how far he's willing to risk his speakership.<br/>The good of the party, and not his seat of power, propelled Boehner's decision to bring the superstorm Sandy relief bill to a vote earlier this year, when it passed with just a minority of support from Republicans. That combination -- Democrats and the moderate wing of the House GOP -- is the pathway to enacting a sweeping set of bipartisan agreements.<br/>A week after the storm vote, a large bipartisan majority passed a three-month extension of the debt ceiling. "It is hard to see this Congress being viewed as a bipartisan one, but we have seen a glimmer of light on the recent bipartisan vote to extend the debt ceiling," said Ron Bonjean, a onetime aide to the Republican leadership.<br/>Obama's Duty<br/>Maintaining that momentum in the House won't be easy, and it could require Obama's personal leadership. Getting Boehner to take such a perilous route could depend in large part on successful cajoling from the president. And on this subject -- the relationships among Washington's top leaders -- discussion of a deal being cut becomes sharply pessimistic.<br/>IFR’s cause a huge fight.<br/>Elias 8—San Diego Tribune Staff, Political Commentator Thomas D.

Combined with the fact that it depends on a sophisticated form of nuclear technology, that appears to make the notion of power plants using the Integral Fast Reactor anathema to today's politicians.<br/>But it shouldn't. For this technology is demonstrably safer than any existing nuclear power plant, depends almost completely on recycling for its fuel and would make virtually no contribution to worldwide climate change.<br/>Yes, there are serious problems with today's version of nuclear power. The most <br/>AND<br/>designed atomic plant, but that doesn't stop people or politicians from worrying.<br/>Meanwhile, no such concerns apply to the Integral Fast Reactor (IFR), designed at the Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois and its Idaho satellite facility during the 1980s and '90s at a cost of more than 1 billion taxpayer dollars.<br/>The design was shelved and a small prototype essentially deep-sixed in 1994, ostensibly because of concerns that it might lead to proliferation of nuclear weapons.<br/>Here are some of the advantages of the IFR, as listed by Steve Kirsch, a multimillionaire Silicon Valley software entrepreneur who has pushed the concept for several years:<br/>These reactors can be fueled entirely with today's used nuclear fuel, consuming virtually all of the long-lived radio-isotopes that make storage of spent fuel rods such a problem. It would take IFRs centuries to use up the supplies of uranium that have already been mined, in part because this design is about 100 times more efficient in milking energy from uranium than those in use today.<br/>IFRs require no enrichment of uranium, can be fueled with plutonium waste from other nuclear plants and emit almost no greenhouse gases. Such reactors would be cooled with liquid sodium, so they would not require massive water supplies and therefore can be located almost anywhere (read: isolated, desolate areas far from the large populations that might use the energy they produce).<br/>The main disadvantage -- the one that killed the idea back in the mid-'90s -- is the fear that it would lead to proliferation of weapons-grade uranium because it is a form of "breeder" reactor that could theoretically produce more fissionable material than it uses.<br/>But that's a matter of choice, making the breeder issue a red herring, an objection raised even though it has little merit only because it will alarm large numbers of people. For IFRs can be designed to use just as much fuel as they create, or more. In fact, it is today's thermal reactors that are large producers of ultra-dangerous plutonium.<br/>The other problem with IFRs -- this one legitimate -- is that the liquid sodium cooling them could catch fire. But the scientists who developed the IFR design insisted that adding an extra cooling loop to each reactor would likely prevent this.<br/>Kirsch maintains the IFR project was killed because it threatened oil companies, uranium mines, coal mines and natural gas companies. Which it would.<br/>But George Stanford, a Ph.D. nuclear physicist who helped create the IFR design at Argonne, believes the main reason was fear of proliferation. "Well-meaning but ill-informed people claiming to be experts confused the issue and convinced many administrators and legislators the IFR was a threat," he said in a remarkable 2001 essay that can be accessed at nationalcenter.org/NPA378.html.<br/>There is no doubt that American ingenuity has solved innumerable problems and won several wars. That same creativity also produced a power plant idea that could solve many of today's energy problems while doing little or no harm to citizens or the environment.<br/>Key to competiveness. &nbsp;<br/>Bloomberg, 10/23/2012. “Blame Politics for the U.S. Engineer Shortage,” <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-23/blame-politics-for-the-u-s-engineer-shortage.html." tppabs="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-23/blame-politics-for-the-u-s-engineer-shortage.html."><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-23/blame-politics-for-the-u-s-engineer-shortage.html.</span></a></span></p><p>Given the tepid economic recovery, it’s sad that Congress cannot enact a pro-<br/>AND<br/>do is let these people stay here and let American companies hire them.<br/>The cost of failing to do so is large, as the American technology industry <br/>AND<br/>in these sectors, both of which currently face severe shortages of talent.<br/>The best economic research on high-skilled immigration, recently assembled here by the Kauffman Foundation, suggests extensive economic gains from growing America’s stock of human capital.

In particular, U.S. leadership in nuclear technology and operations can strengthen U.S. influence with respect to other countries’ nuclear programs and the evolution of the international nonproliferation regime, while also supporting U.S. competitiveness in a major export market.<br/>Nuclear power technologies are distinct from other potential exports in energy or in other sectors <br/>AND<br/>, could help address concerns about the proliferation of uranium-enrichment capabilities).<br/>COMMERCIAL NUCLEAR OPERATIONS<br/>As the world’s largest commercial nuclear operator and dominant weapons state, the United States <br/>AND<br/>of nuclear materials and technologies, but this dominance too has slowly declined.<br/>At present, however, the U.S. safety and security infrastructure and <br/>AND<br/>in domestic nuclear energy activities could erode U.S. international standing.<br/>COMPETITIVE COMMERCIAL NUCLEAR EXPORTS<br/>As an active participant in commercial markets, the United States has considerable leverage internationally <br/>AND<br/>nonproliferation organizations like the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) as well.<br/>In addition, BPC’s Nuclear Initiative recognizes that a nuclear accident is a low-probability event that would have high consequences regionally or globally. Many countries that have expressed interest in, or the intention to, develop domestic nuclear power lack important infrastructure, education, and regulatory institutions. We believe that, if these programs move forward, the United States has a critical commercial and advisory role to play.<br/>However, domestic exporters of U.S. nuclear technology, fuels, and <br/>AND<br/>jurisdiction over commercial nuclear trade, global safety and security, and nonproliferation.<br/>In an attempt to ameliorate current competitive disadvantages, the Obama administration recently created a <br/>AND<br/>.S. companies to compete more effectively in the global nuclear marketplace.<br/>LEADERSHIP ON INTERNATIONAL ISSUES RELATED TO THE NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE<br/>Leadership in technological and policy developments related to the management of the nuclear fuel cycle <br/>AND<br/>technologies are sound and we support efforts to maintain and expand these policies.<br/>We also believe that international fuel assurances and spent fuel take-back capabilities would give new-entrant countries a powerful incentive to forgo their own enrichment and reprocessing activities. This is particularly true given the fact that most current and proposed national nuclear energy programs are too small to justify indigenous fuel-cycle programs, at least in economic terms.35<br/>For many years, the United States and other countries and organizations, including the <br/>AND<br/>new entrants look for more comprehensive service packages beyond reactor design and construction.<br/>In particular, the ability to take advantage of spent fuel take-back services may provide a strong incentive for countries to participate in multinational fuel arrangements and could allow for more secure, long-term stewardship of spent fuel. Of course, to offer this service, the United States and its partners would have to develop effective spent fuel management and disposal capabilities of their own.<br/>Strategic Goal: Historically, the United States has been a leader in nuclear technology research and commercialization. To extend this tradition and assure further innovation, the United States must continue to support research and development efforts within the nuclear industry, the national labs, and U.S. universities.<br/>We believe that progress currently underway in a few technical areas will be especially helpful <br/>AND<br/>related research, development, and deployment (RDandD) programs.<br/>Beginning in 2002, DOE actively supported the development of advanced passive reactors through the Nuclear Power 2010<br/>program, a government and industry cost-sharing effort that focused on overcoming major technical and regulatory barriers to the deployment of new nuclear power plants. The program supported design certification and first-of-a-kind engineering for two Generation III+ reactor designs (the AP1000 and the Economic Simplified Boiling-Water Reactor), as well as three early site permits and two COLs.<br/>In December 2011, the NRC unanimously certified the first Generation III+ reactor design, the Westinghouse AP1000. This approval and the subsequent decision to build two new reactors using the AP1000 design at Southern Company’s Vogtle site sets an important precedent for additional nuclear plant construction in the United States and internationally.<br/>Four AP1000 reactors are currently under construction in China and several U.S. <br/>AND<br/>build additional advanced passive reactors rather than conventional Generation II or III reactors.<br/>Continued leadership in the development of advanced nuclear technologies presents an important export opportunity for the U.S. nuclear industry and for our nation’s economy. The Commerce Department estimates that the international market for nuclear equipment and services will grow to $500–$740 billion over the next ten years.40 Perhaps more importantly, as previously discussed, U.S. commercial strength in this area provides substantial co-benefits in terms of national security.<br/>Beyond the near-term opportunities described above, we believe it is critical to <br/>AND<br/>believe that nuclear energy must remain a priority area for federal energy investment.<br/>Several prominent recent studies, including the BRC report discussed previously and the Massachusetts Institute <br/>AND<br/>capital and technical expertise needed to sustain a leadership role in the future.<br/>Conclusion<br/>Over the course of the last year, BPC’s Nuclear Initiative event series has sparked <br/>AND<br/>effective actions to support continued U.S. leadership in nuclear energy.<br/>As a starting point, policy makers and the public must understand the important role <br/>AND<br/>for managing and disposing of spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste.<br/>In addition, policy makers and the public must understand the clear linkages that exist <br/>AND<br/>issues of vital interest to our long-term energy and national security.</p><p>Leadership prevents nuclear terrorism. <br/>Sagan 11 (Scott D., Caroline S.G.

Uranium prices have been in a slump since the reactor meltdown in Fukushima, Japan, in March 2011—yet there are reasons to believe the slump may be temporary.<br/>"World demand is growing, and supplies aren't growing fast enough," says Adam Schatzker, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets in Toronto. Today's low prices aren't sustainable, he says, and are likely to recover in the next few years. "It's just a matter of when," he says.<br/>The world-wide nuclear-power industry was thrown into turmoil by Fukushima. Japan, the world's third-largest nuclear-power producer at the time, mothballed its other reactors. Other countries have closed plants and put plans for expansion under review. Some might exit nuclear power altogether.<br/>Yet while the reaction to Fukushima might slow the growth of nuclear power, it won't reverse it. Many countries, particularly emerging-market nations such as China, India, Russia and South Korea, are bringing many more reactors online to meet their rising energy needs. Currently 62 new reactors are being built around the world, and many more are planned.<br/>The International Atomic Energy Agency predicts nuclear-power production will rise between 35% and 100% over the next 20 years. The World Nuclear Association, a trade group, estimates total demand for uranium will rise by about 60% over that time.<br/>China, which faces growing pollution problems from fossil fuels, recently resumed permitting new reactors, ending a hiatus that followed Fukushima. It already has approved four new reactors in a matter of months, on top of the 28 that were already under construction, notes Jonathan Hinze, an analyst at uranium-research firm Ux Consulting. The new reactors will use a more modern and safer design, developed after the 40-year-old Fukushima plant was built.<br/>In Japan, which has few domestic sources of energy, new Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has publicly reversed his predecessor's antinuclear stance. Mr. Abe says he wants to bring many of the country's reactors back online and recently talked about building new, safer reactors. Japan has few domestic sources of energy and is heavily dependent on oil imports.<br/>Meanwhile, a 20-year agreement to decommission old Soviet warheads and convert the uranium for use in reactors is due to expire this year. Analysts don't expect it to be renewed. This could put upward pressure on prices, because the agreement currently supplies one-eighth of world uranium needs.<br/>The World Nuclear Association warns that world-wide uranium demand might exceed supply next year.<br/>Meanwhile, this past week, a Russian state-controlled entity struck a $2.6 billion deal to secure future supplies by taking control of global mining company Uranium One SXRZF -0.63% .<br/>All this spells a bullish case for uranium. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, less than half the world's uranium reserves can be mined profitably at current levels. Mining costs are rising quickly. Mr. Schatzker at RBC says the industry needs prices at $75 or $80 a pound for future mine production to be profitable; it currently trades at $42.25.<br/>Just before Fukushima the price was about $70. Mr. Schatzker thinks prices might get back there within three years. In 2008, just before the financial crisis, uranium hit $135.<br/>There are risks to investing in uranium, of course. Another disaster might spell doom for the industry. Nuclear programs remain subject to political pressure. The world's energy needs might grow more slowly than forecast, reducing the need for nuclear power. Other energy supplies, such as natural gas or solar power, might prove cheaper or more abundant than expected.<br/>IFR’s eliminate all uranium mining – their 1AC<br/>Blees et al 11 (Charles Archambeau , Randolph Ware, Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences, Tom Blees, National Center for Atmospheric Research, Barry Brook, Yoon Chang, University of Colorado, Jerry Peterson, Argonne National Laboratory, Robert Serafin Joseph Shuster Tom Wigley, “IFR: An optimized approach to meeting global energy needs (Part I)” 2/1/11) <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../bravenewclimate.com/2011/02/01/ifr-optimized-source-for-global-energy-needs-part-i/)" tppabs="http://bravenewclimate.com/2011/02/01/ifr-optimized-source-for-global-energy-needs-part-i/)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://bravenewclimate.com/2011/02/01/ifr-optimized-source-for-global-energy-needs-part-i/)</span></a></span></p><p>Fossil fuels currently supply about 80% of humankind’s primary energy.

Kazakhstan is a strategic linchpin in the vast Central Asian-Caspian Basin zone, a region rich in energy resources and a potential gateway for commerce and communications between Europe and Asia.<br/>However, it is also an area that faces an assortment of troubling security challenges. Ensuring a stable and secure Central Asia is important for the international interests of the United States and its European allies for several prescient reasons:<br/>• Asian Security: Because of its proximity to Russia, China, Iran, and the South Asian sub-continent, Kazakhstan’s security and stability is an increasingly vital interest to all major powers. Kazakhstan’s tenure as chair of the OSCE will become an opportunity for greater multilateral cooperation in achieving this objective while strengthening the role and prestige of the OSCE throughout Central Asia.<br/>• Afghanistan: Central Asia is a key staging area for U.S. and NATO military operations in Afghanistan against Taliban insurgents and Al Qaeda militants. Central Asia is a crucial conduit for U.S. and NATO troops and supplies into Afghanistan. U.S. offi cials recently reached new agreements with Russia, Kazakhstan, and other Central Asian countries to allow Afghanbound non-military supplies through their territories.<br/>• Trans-National Terrorism: The Taliban resurgence in Afghanistan stimulates cross-border terrorism that may endanger the stability of several Central Asian neighbors and undermine Western interests. Central Asian states have been the victims of Afghanistan-based transnational terrorism. These states, including Kazakhstan, can support international efforts to counter regional terrorist networks.<br/>• Organized Crime and Drug Traffi cking: Central Asia is an important transit region for narcotics traffi cking between Afghanistan and the countries of Europe and Asia. Joint initiatives that will enable the Kazakh government to control and monitor borders more effectively, intercept smuggling operations, and eradicate criminal networks will buttress international security and curtail funding to cross-border terrorist groups.<br/>• Energy Security: Central Asia has the potential to be a vital energy source for Europe. The region contains a vast storehouse of oil and natural gas, which Europe urgently needs in order to lessen its reliance on Russian and Middle Eastern energy supplies. Disputes between Russia and several energy transit states, such as Ukraine, have increased Europe’s interest in developing direct supply lines between Europe and the Caspian countries.<br/>Challenges to International Interests<br/>Despite the strategic significance of Central Asia and the Caspian Basin, in recent years <br/>AND<br/>on the part of other major powers competing for influence in Central Asia.<br/>Many Western experts conclude that Russia’s leaders have sought to use multi-national organizations, Moscow’s political connections and its economic leverage to assert greater control over ex-Soviet neighbors. There are reports that the Central Asian governments were pressured to curtail Western security interests, including limiting its military presence in the region by, for example, urging Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan to evict the U.S. military from bases on their territory.<br/>Kazakh leaders are supportive of a more effective American and European role in Central Asia <br/>AND<br/>enhance Astana’s role as a regional stabilizer.<br/>Kazakhstan as a Regional Stabilizer<br/>Despite having the largest territory and economy in Central Asia, Kazakhstan is not a <br/>AND<br/>hegemonic ambitions by larger countries that would undercut Kazakhstan’s political or economic independence.<br/>While it is a member of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), the <br/>AND<br/>an Individual Partnership Action Plan (IPAP) with NATO in January 2006.<br/>NATO’s June 2004 summit affirmed the growing importance of Central Asia by designating the region as an area of “special focus” and stationing a liaison officer in the Kazakh capital of Astana in order to develop NATO assistance programs to modernize national military structures. A NATO Secretary General Special Representative for the Caucasus and Central Asia was also appointed.<br/>Astana has underscored that neither the CSTO nor the SCO should become exclusive military alliances <br/>AND<br/>become fully operational by 2011 and potentially available for international peace stability missions.<br/>Kazakhstan is the only Central Asian country to have an Action Plan to assist in the reconstruction process in Afghanistan, including granting more than $3 million in the 2007-2008 fiscal year for social and infrastructure projects, humanitarian aid, and training for Afghan law enforcement and border patrol officers. For 2009-2011, Kazakhstan has committed an additional $5 million to improve the water supply and distribution infrastructure for shipments of grain and other commodities.<br/>Kazakhstan also provides funding to support U.S. objectives in the region. <br/>AND<br/>economic development project aimed at strengthening Kazakhstan’s capacity to achieve its development goals.”<br/>Kazakhstan has initiated and championed the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-Building in Asia <br/>AND<br/>and move it closer to Europe.<br/>Multi-National Counter-Terrorism<br/>Kazakhstan has been combating several potential threats to its own stability and that of its <br/>AND<br/>to defend each country against major terrorist threats.<br/>Regional Non-Proliferation<br/>KazakhstanwasthefirstformerSovietrepublictoabandon its nuclear arsenal.

(Note that the construction cycle for power plants is similar in duration.)<br/>Global warming initiatives - Nuclear power does not generate greenhouse gases. Should major energy consuming countries adopt aggressive global warming initiatives, nuclear power would be an obvious beneficiary.<br/>New mining opportunities - Persistently high uranium prices will open up new mining and extraction opportunities for investors.<br/>Investor participation - Although energy and natural resource investors have bought heavily into uranium, it is still not widely held by the broad investment community. There is still a lot of room for expansion.<br/>Risks<br/>Technological risk - New technologies such as the Integral Fast Reactor could turn the uranium supply/demand equation upside down.

Rigorous testing—lack of depth means debates on their chosen topic won’t be productive—any valuable debate cannot occur unless the topic and form of argument are established in advance—also means we can’t test the truth-value of their claims.<br/>Here are some examples of AFFs they allow—<br/>-WGA, We almost lost Detroit<br/>-WGA, Nuclear Secrecy<br/>-Emporia – Re-energize Debate<br/>-Oklahoma’s Black gold AFF<br/>-Oklahoma’s space traders AFF<br/>-Idaho State’s Queer Bots AFF<br/>2. Ground—the resolution is chosen because it is controversial and creates a division of ground that is procedurally fair in the sense that everyone has relatively the same AFF/NEG balance—allowing the AFF to pick the topic allows them to rig the game by picking an issue where they have the moral high ground—AFF/NEG equalization is key because it is non-arbitrary and applies to all teams equally.<br/>In the world of our interpretation the affirmative has to say more energy production is good, and the negative can always say more energy production is bad. &nbsp;We get arguments like the production critique, electricity DAs; energy prices DAs, energy trade off DAs.<br/>This has to be a voting issue—we have to invest massive amounts of time to get back to square zero—the potential for abuse alone overstretches our research burdens and our strategy was irreparably altered by their failure to advocate the resolution in the 1AC. &nbsp;Unreasonable burden for the 2NR to go for substance and framework because the 2ar can just pick which one they want to answer and focus the debate.<br/>USFG<br/>Theoretical debates must be policy relevant—it improves students learning and makes academia valuable.<br/>Jentleson 2—Bruce Jentleson, Director of the Terry Sanford Institute of Public Policy and Professor of Public Policy and Political Science at Duke University International Security 26.4 (2002) 169-183, Project Muse</li></ol><p>To be sure, political science and international relations have produced and continue to produce <br/>AND<br/>to fulfill its broader societal responsibilities that greater praxis is to be pursued.<br/>Illusion of agency is valuable. <br/>Shove and Walker 7 Elizabeth Sociology @ Lancaster Gordon Geography @ Lancaster “CAUTION!

More than 40,000 urban public school students have competed in UDLs.<br/>Policy debate is the most academically rigorous of all interscholastic speech activities and the oldest, dating back to 1928, of all high school academic competitions. Policy debate develops core academic skills: literacy, critical thinking, research, communication, organization, and supporting of arguments.<br/>UDLs can have a fundamental impact on participating schools. An Argumentation and Debate course is offered at almost half of the schools in the Urban Debate Network. Curricular Debate, a method that incorporates formal debating throughout the regular curriculum, is offered in several districts.<br/>UDLs promote education equity. Not only are they providing rigorous academic training to students from all across participating cities, some of those urban public school students are competing nationally and winning. UDLs have placed highly at state debate championships in California, Georgia, Illinois, New Jersey, and New York. UDL teams have been in the top 16 National Finalists on four separate occasions, placing 5th in the nation in 2003.<br/>Debate training equips youth for future success. Former debaters are disproportionately represented among leaders in the media, the business word, the law, the academy, and the government. Nearly two out of three Members of the 104th U.S. Congress (1996-97) were former debaters.<br/>Urban debate is highly efficient and cost-effective as an out-of-school-time program. A full academic season costs under $750 per student served, compared with an industry average of nearly $1,500.<br/>The commitment by urban public school districts to urban debate is substantial and growing. &nbsp;Since 1997, approximately $11 million has been invested in Urban Debate Leagues by school districts such as those in Baltimore, Detroit, St. Louis, Seattle, Newark, Kansas City, and Chicago. Private partners have also made significant, multi-million dollar investments in UDLs.</p><p>And participation is record-breaking and will continue to grow—latest data.<br/>NAUDL 12 — National Association of Urban Debate Leagues, 2012 (“National Association of Urban Debate Leagues Winter 2012 Newsletter,” Winter, Available Online at <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../www.urbandebate.org/newsblastwinter12.shtml" tppabs="http://www.urbandebate.org/newsblastwinter12.shtml"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.urbandebate.org/newsblastwinter12.shtml</span></a></span>, Accessed 04-05-2012)</p><p>Urban debate is growing!
