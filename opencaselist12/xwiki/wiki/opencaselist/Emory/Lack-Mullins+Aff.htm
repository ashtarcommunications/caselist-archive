Aren’t we receiving artistic training when we’re given techniques to ‘make it clear’ for the judge, ‘resonate’ with them, ‘paint them a picture’? What if strategic debate is defined by particular aesthetic rhythms, the affective winds that carry the ballots turning the turbines of production of aff and neg cases? Do we dare deny the genealogy of aesthetic imperialism and its racial divisions of natural and unnatural, pure and impure? If the violence of our aesthetics never reached our conscious perception, could we enjoy nationalism, slavery and genocide as beautiful harmony? Wouldn’t this aesthetic machinery necessitate an investigation, such that we ensure debate trains our ideological packaging in ways worth training?</p><p>At the nexus of every discourse on energy production is a set of aesthetic assumptions about what that world is, where the energy is coming from. Whether the world conceived as dead materiality to be exploited or even a mother Earth that was harmonious before the entrance of human agents, a violent aesthetics of the Whole and the One purifies the world of alterity before it can even enter our conscious consideration.<br/>Morton 7<br/>[Ecology without Nature, p. 14-17]<br/>One of the ideas inhibiting genuinely ecological politics, ethics, philosophy, and art is the idea of nature itself. Nature, a transcendental term in a material mask, stands at the end of a potentially infinite series of other terms that collapse into it, otherwise known as a metonymic list: fish, grass, mountain air, chimpanzees, love, soda water, freedom of choice, heterosexuality, free markets . . . Nature. A metonymic series becomes a metaphor. Writing conjures this notoriously slippery term, useful to ideologies of all kinds in its very slipperiness, in its refusal to maintain any consistency.11 But consistency is what nature is all about, on another level. Saying that something is unnatural is saying that it does not conform to a norm, so "normal" that it is built into the very fabric of things as they are. So "nature" occupies at least three places in symbolic language. First, it is a mere empty placeholder for a host of other concepts. Second, it has the force of law, a norm against which deviation is measured. Third, "nature" is a Pandora's box, a word that encapsulates a potentially infinite series of disparate fantasy objects. It is this third sense—nature as fantasy—that this book most fully engages. A "discipline" of diving into the Rorschach blobs of others' enjoyment that we commonly call poems seems a highly appropriate way of beginning to engage with how "nature" compels feelings and beliefs.¶ Nature wavers m between the divine and the material. Far from being something "natural" itself, nature hovers over things like a ghost. It slides over the infinite list of things that evoke it. Nature is thus not unlike "the subject," a being who searches through the entire üniverse for its reflection, only to find none. If it is just another word for supreme authority, then why not just call it God? But if this God is nothing outside the material world, then why not just call it matter? This was the political dilemma in which Spinoza, and the deists of eighteenth-century Europe, found themselves,- Being an "out" atheist was very dangerous in the eighteenth century, as evidenced by the cryptic remarks of Hume and the increasingly cautious approach of Percy Shelley, who had been expelled from Oxford for publishing a pamphlet on atheism. God often appeared on the side of royal au- thority, and the rising bourgeoisie and associated revolutionary classes wanted another way of being authoritative. "Ecology without nature" means in part that we try to confront some of the intense notions which nature smudges.¶ Ecological writing is fascinated with the idea of something that exists in between polarized terms such as God and matter, this and that, subject and object. I find John Locke's critique of the idea of ether to be helpful here. Locke's critique appeared toward the beginning of the modern construction of space as an empty set of point coordinates. Numerous holes in materialist, atomist theories were filled by some thing elemental. Newton's gravity worked because of an ambient ether that transmitted the properties of heavy bodies instantaneously, in an analogy for (or as an aspect off the love of an omnipresent God.14 If ether is a kind of "ambient fluid" that surrounds all particles, existing in between" them, then what surrounds the particles of ambient fluid themselves?) If nature is sandwiched between terms such as God and immer, what medium keeps the things that are natural sandwiched to- gether? Nature appears to be both lettuce and mayonnaise. Ecological writing shuffles subject and object back and forth so that we may think they have dissolved into each other, though what we usually end up with is a blur this book calls ambience.¶ Later in the modern period, the idea of the nation-state emerged as a way of going beyond the authority of the monarch. The nation all too often depends upon the very same list that evokes the idea of nature. Nature and nation are very closely intertwined. I show how ecocritique could examine the ways in which nature does not necessarily take us outside society, but actually forms the bedrock of nationalist enjoyment. Nature, practically a synonym for evil in the Middle Ages, was considered the basis of social good by the Romantic period. According to numerous writers such as Rousseau, the framers of the social con- tract start out in a state of nature, the fact that this state is not much different from the "concrete jungle" of actual historical circumstance has not escaped attention.¶ In the Enlightenment, nature became a way of establishing racial and sexual identity, and science became the privileged way of demonstrating it. The normal was set up as different from the pathological along the coordinates of the natural and the unnatural.lb Nature, by then a scientific term, put a stop to argument or rational inquiry: "Well, it’s just in my nature." He is ideological, you are prejudiced, but my ideas are natural. A metaphorical use of Thomas Malthus in the work of Charles Darwin, for example, naturalized, and continues to naturalize, the workings of the "invisible hand" of the free market and the "survival of the fittest"—which is always taken to mean the competitive war of all (owners) against all (workers). Malthus used nature to argue against the continuation of early modern welfare, m a document produced tor the government of his age. Sadly, this very thinking is now being used to push down the poor yet further, in the battle of the supposedly ecologically minded against "population growth" (and immigration). Nature, achieved obliquely through turning metonymy into metaphor, becomes an oblique way of talking about politics. What is presented as straightforward, "unmarked," beyond contestation, is warped.¶ One of the basic problems with nature is that it could be considered either as a substance, as a squishy thing in itself, or as essence, as an abstract principle that transcends the material realm and even the realm of representation. Edmund Burke considers substance as the stuff of nature in his writing on the sublime.27 This "substantialism" asserts that there is at least one actually existing thing that embodies a sublime quality (vastness, terror, magnificence). Substantialism tends to promote a monarchist or authoritarian view that there is an external thing to which the subject should bow. Essentialism, on the other hand, has its champion in Immanuel Kant. The sublime thing can never be represented, and indeed, in certain religions, says Kant, there is a prohibition against trying (Judaism, Islam). This essentialism turns out to be politically liberating, on the side of revolutionary republicanism.21 On the whole, nature writing, and its precursors and family members, mostly in phenomenological and/or Romantic writing, has tended to favor a substantialist view of nature—it is palpable and there—despite the ex- plicit politics of the author. Further work in ecocritique should delineate a republican, nonsubstantialist countertradition running through writers such as Milton and Shelley, for whom nature did not stand in for an authority for which you sacrifice your autonomy and reason.¶ Ecological forms of subjectivity involve ideas and decisions about group identity and behavior. Subjectivity is not simply an individual, and certainly not just an individualist, phenomenon. It is a collective one. Environmental writing is a way of registering the feeling of being surrounded by others, or more abstractly, by an otherness, some- thing that is not the self. Although it may displace the actual social col- lective and choose to write about surrounding mountains instead, such displacements always say something about the kinds of collective life that ecological writing is envisaging. Fredric Jameson outlines the necessity for criticism to work on ideas of collectivity:¶ Anyone who evokes the ultimate value of the community or the collectivity from a left perspective must face three problems: 11 how to distin- guish this position radically from communitarianism; Z) how to differentiate the collective project from fascism or nazism; 3) how to relate the social and the economic level—that is, how to use the Marxist analysis of capitalism to demonstrate the unviability of social solutions within that stratem. As for collective identities, in a historical moment in which individual personal identity has been unmasked as a decentered local of multiple subject positions, surely it is not too much to ask that something analogous be conceptualized on the collective level.2'¶ The idea of the environment is more or less a way of considering groups and collectives—humans surrounded by nature, or in continuity with other beings such as animals and plants. It is about being-with. As La- tour has recently pointed out, however, the actual situation is far more drastically collective than that. All kinds of beings, from toxic waste to sea snails, are clamoring for our scientific, political, and artistic attention, and have become part of political lite—to the detriment of mono- lithic conceptions of Nature.,n To write about ecology is to write about society, and not simply in the weak sense that our ideas of ecology are social constructions. Historical conditions have abolished an extra- social nature to which theories of society can appeal, while at the same time making the beings that tell under this heading impinge ever more urgently upon society.</p><p>The wind turbine is a strategic nodal point in aesthetic programming. Specifically, wind energy debates produce the notion of the ‘landscape’ as untouched nature that we can enjoy as visual resource. <br/>Brian Miles, May 2008.

These typifications, which are similar to Shields’s “place-images,” make sense only in the context of particular heritage narratives and they “come about through over- simplification (i.e. reduction to one trait), stereotyping (amplification of one or more traits) and labeling (where a place is deemed to be of a certain nature)” (Shields 1991, p. 47). Typifications can persist even after the real or assumed spatial or social components of their formation are gone. As Shields (1991) remarks: “such a label further impacts on material activities and may be clung to despite changes in the ‘real’ nature of the site” (p. 47). This reinforcement of landscape form can be seen in the Vermont wind energy debate. Typification of Vermont as the ‘Green Mountain State’ (i.e. a pristine forested landscape with small farms tastefully dotting a countryside that is harmonious with nature) limits the range of aesthetically permissible human intervention in the landscape at the same time that the energy demands of the state’s growing urban and suburban populations are met with technologies that are seemingly at odds with the state’s environmental consciousness (e.g. nuclear energy; imported oil, natural gas, and large- scale hydroelectric). Community typifications are used in two related ways in public discourse:¶ They provide concise definitions of particular places and, perhaps more importantly, they highlight the differences between communities ... When used in this way, they can mobilize action by raising the specter that the familiar and valued will be transformed into something alien where the quality of life is less than desirable. (Bridger 1996, p. 356) 19¶ This typification and opposition process can be seen in the Vermont wind energy debate. For example, in a letter to the editor of The Caledonian-Record, one opponent of wind development in the Northeast Kingdom of Vermont states that:¶ a major contributor to the economy of the area is tourism but we do not attract the shop-until-you-drop set. We are the home to and destination of those seeking the beauty, solitude and abundant wildlife of the area. (Soininen 2005)¶ Community typifications quickly communicate the narrative context that a speaker is drawing on. As such, they are useful for understanding with what aspects of a community or a landscape a speaker is identifying.¶ Rhetorical narratives are accounts of events, real or hypothetical, that are told to persuade (Bridger 1996, p. 357). These narratives are associated with ideographs, which are a common “vocabulary of concepts that function as guides, warrants, reasons, or excuses for behavior and belief” (McGee 1980 cited in Bridger 1996, p. 357). These concepts are typically vague terms, the abstract nature of which allows even groups with competing goals to identify with them. Ideographs are:¶ short phrases that represent an orientation towards an abstract ideology...they are best thought of as setting loose constraints of thought, action, and debate while simultaneously serving as rhetorical tools that competing groups use as they attempt to influence the “official” definitions of particular situations. (Bridger 1996, p. 357)¶ The meaning of an ideograph is specified when it is employed as “the moral of the story” in a particular rhetorical narrative. These narratives also include: plot, character, and setting. In addition, they rely heavily on “characterizations,” which Condit (1987) defines as “universalized descriptions of particular agents, acts, scenes, purposes, or agencies...” (cited in Bridger 1996, p. 358). When characterizations become taken-for- granted knowledge, they change the course of public discourse. It is through discourse- 20 changing characterizations and the ‘morals’ associated with an ideograph that rhetorical narratives transform heritage narratives of place—reproducing certain community typifications, redefining others, and introducing new typifications.¶ 2.4. Narrative, identity, and social movements¶ According to Glover (2004) narratives, as used in the advocacy campaigns of contemporary social movements, encode “collectively constructed and shared meanings, interpretations, rituals, and identities” that represent the common cause, the esprit de corps of grassroots groups that constitute a movement (p. 48). Davis (2002) asserts that the stories used by social movements are powerful vehicles “for producing, articulating, regulating, and diffusing shared meaning” (p. 22). Fine (2002) argues that narratives enable collective action by providing sharable symbolic representations of reality that help people understand their positions within power structures in societies; narratives allow culture to be communicated and thus shared; it is these shared cultures that enable sustained collective action (p. 230). Glover (2004) argues that stories accomplish this by helping individuals recognize their shared experiences and connected futures (p. 47). Further, “grassroots associations are institutional contexts in which collective identities are forged through the social practice of story telling” (ibid., p. 48).¶ According to Polletta and Jasper (2001), the goals of recent social movement groups are less overtly concerned with redistributing political power than with defending their collective identity: 21¶ Unlike the civil rights and early labor movements ... post-citizenship movements are peopled by those who already enjoy most or all of the normal rights of citizens ... Participants in these movements do not usually have an identity imposed on them by the political and legal systems, accordingly they have more freedom to engage in creative reformations of who they are (p. 287).¶ Collective identities represent an individual’s emotional, moral, and cognitive connections to a broader imagined or experiential community. Distinct from, but part of personal identities, collective identities are “expressed in cultural materials—names, narratives, symbols, verbal styles, rituals, clothing,” etc. (ibid., p. 285). “New social movements”—which I argue that grassroots groups organized around the Vermont wind power debate can in part be described as—establish and defend the ideational space for their identities and lifestyles through the management of meaning. This meaning making is accomplished through the telling of stories.3 Further:¶ social movements are not viewed merely as carriers of extant ideas and meanings that grow automatically out of structural arrangements, unanticipated events, or existing ideologies. Rather, movement actors are viewed as signifying agents actively engaged in the production and maintenance of meaning for constituents, antagonists, and bystanders or observers (Snow and Benford 1988 cited in Benford and Snow 2000, p. 613).¶ What gives rise to the ‘contentious identities’ that groups defend using meanings conveyed by narratives? That is, how do the social movements who craft such narratives develop? According to Polletta and Jasper (2001), the identities that these groups construct are culturally mediated, emerging from personal responses to structural forces (e.g. the boom-bust cycles of capitalist markets, the unequal distribution of the costs and benefits of economic development). The structural influences on these responses can be understood in terms of actors’ positions in overlapping networks of economic, political, 22¶ and social relations (ibid., p. 289). Actors construct identities by inhabiting particular nodes in these networks and by articulating, through stories, the information that traverses the interconnecting network edges using historically- and culturally-determined semiotic tools. Thus, collective identities are defined in terms of their adherents’: (1) social relations, (2) prior personal and cultural experience.¶ Collective identities are an instance of discursive-material formation. Materially, they are constituted in the bodies, material goods, and the surrounding environment of the actors who assume them. Collective identities are constituted discursively in the meanings interpreted, based on prior cultural experience, from the information that actors draw from and inject into the economic, political, and social networks of which they are a part. Horton’s (2003) study of “green” identities espoused by post-1960s environmental social movements of Lancaster, England shows how the materialities of these lifestyles— style of dress, architecture, car ownership, grocery shopping—serve as signifiers, as cultural codes for the performance of identity by members of the movements. And as Vanderbeck (2006) illustrates, cultural codes associated with a collective identity are deployed discursively by both those who espouse and those who combat that identity. As discursive-material formations, the collective identities of grassroots groups reflect and can influence the shape of the landscape inhabited by group members as well as the discourses (i.e. stories) about those landscapes. By representing particular collective identities in narratives, grassroots groups advocate for the continuation of a particular lifestyle in a particular landscape (i.e. particular social-spatial relations). In providing conventions for the form a landscape should take (e.g. rolling hills of farm fields bisected by winding roads with forested ridge lines in the distance) and the social activities that 23 ought to take place therein (e.g. dairy farming, sightseeing, shopping at farm stands) the discursive-material collective identities of these groups are related to Shield’s (1991) social spatialization.¶ 2.5. Landscape and identity¶ In this thesis, I argue that the grassroots associations that have formed around the Vermont wind energy debate (both for and against development) make meaning— construct their collective identities—by transforming heritage narratives and characterizations of Vermont through the rhetorical narratives they employ in the debate. The meanings of these narratives are conveyed via frames that define problems (see section 2.6). Through these narratives, these organizations represent the Vermont landscape using particular community typifications. These competing persuasive representations tap into particular heritage narratives and characterizations that invite readers to identify with meanings of Vermont that are harmonious with the collective identity of a particular grassroots organization. According to Glover (2004), the identities espoused by a grassroots organization can be understood by studying how a particular organization portrays itself as contributing to a particular outcome (p. 50). For example, does the group position itself as a protector, a keeper of a sacred trust? If so, what is the group protecting? The ‘community’, the ‘environment’? From whom or what (i.e. who is the antagonist?) is the group (i.e. the protagonist) protecting it? What will happen if the group fails to keep its charge?¶ 24¶ The narratives of a particular collective identity express the lifestyle associated with that identity. Lifestyles can be thought of as cultural codes and scripts for the performance of an identity (Davis 2002, p. 8; Horton 2003, p. 68). Instead of ascribing identities onto agents, a narrative understanding of identity “emphasizes a dialogical subjectivity and the storied transactions and relationships within which identity and difference are negotiated and renegotiated” (Davis 2002, p. 26; emphasis mine). Indeed, in order for a group to form a common identity, an ‘other’ must be defined (Glover 2004, p. 48), providing negative space against which to distinguish ‘us’ from ‘them.’ Those with whom one identifies are cast as protagonists or heroes to rally for and fight beside against the antagonist or villain represented by the other. As Davis (2002) notes, when a reader identifies with the antagonist of a narrative (i.e. identifies with the grassroots group using a particular narrative), they make the story their own (p. 17). By identifying with a story, one also accepts, more or less, the interpretations of events espoused by grassroots groups.¶ By virtue of their role in identity formation, stories are inherently personal and emotional. This affective nature of stories enables tellers to influence the responses and conclusions that audiences have to stories (Davis 2002, p. 19). This use of stories relies on Berbrier’s concept of “cultural affectation” wherein emotionally laden values espoused by claims-makers and aligned with culturally resonant meanings (Berbrier 1998, p. 440). Contrary to rational arguments, stories are not generally expected to be transparent about their ontological and epistemological assumptions. This makes narratives difficult to contest and refute using the tools of Enlightenment rationality. This difficulty can be seen in some aesthetic arguments present in opposition narratives in the 25 Vermont wind power debate. Unlike questions of habitat impact or economic benefit, when the potential presence of wind turbines on ridgelines in Vermont is portrayed using emotionally-charged words such as ‘abomination,’ poetic musings on the sublime nature of the peaks, photographs evoking the bucolic, or animations depicting lighted turbines on pristine peaks, those who disagree with this portrayal cannot refute such sentiments using the scientific and technical discourses of public policy planning (see section 2.7.3).¶ To summarize, social movements form in order to cause or prevent changes in social-spatial relations. They do this by reasserting or contesting meanings framed through the telling of stories. These stories persuade those outside of a particular movement group insofar as the outsiders can be brought to identify with the members of the group. In this way, social movements seek to achieve their goals through the management of meaning. In this research, I founded my understanding of the rationales Vermont-based grassroots wind groups have used in the debate and how they have used them, in terms of the meaning making work that grassroots groups do as they craft narratives that: (1) sustain and bolster these groups’ collective identities and lifestyles; and (2) reproduce and redefine the symbolic and concrete landscape of Vermont.¶ 2.6. Public policy discourse and framing¶ In this section, I move from the preceding discussion of more general spatial and social theory literature and on to a discussion of concepts central to my case study of the contemporary wind power debate in Vermont. 26¶ Grassroots groups construct stories to convey their preferred understanding of social and natural phenomena. These understandings, these meanings of events and processes, these problem definitions, are expressions of broader systems of meaning or what Gamson (2005) calls “frames.” As Benford and Snow (2000) note, groups generate interpretive frames that “not only differ from existing ones, but that may also challenge them” (p. 614). These collective action frames are constructed in part as movement adherents negotiate a shared understanding of some problematic condition or situation they define as in need of change, make attributions regarding who or what is to blame, articulate an alternative set of arrangements, and urge others to act in concert to affect change (ibid., p. 615).¶ By identifying and focusing attention on the causes of a bounded problem, frames limit the range of solutions to the problem while providing grounds from which to challenge the solutions of others (ibid., pp. 616-617). The frames used by grassroots groups vary in the scope of the problems they define (ibid., p. 618). Broader, more abstract frames can be drawn on by distinct, even conflicting, social movements (e.g. the injustice frame employed by both pro-life and pro-choice groups in contemporary abortion debate— injustice toward fetuses and injustice toward women, respectively). Abstract, or master frames become broadly accepted by virtue of being vaguely defined—the ‘reader’ is free to interpret the frame in a way that resonates with their particular culturally-defined values (ibid., p. 619).¶ The concepts ideograph (which I describe in section 2.3), and frame are closely related. According to Bridger (1996), ideographs set:¶ loose constraints of thought, action, and debate while simultaneously serving as rhetorical tools that competing groups use as they attempt to influence the “official” definitions of particular situations. (p. 357)¶ 27¶ Frames, specifically Benford and Snow’s (2000) collective actions frames, are:¶ shared understanding[s] of some problematic condition or situation they define as in need of change, make attributions regarding who or what is to blame, articulate an alternative set of arrangements, and urge others to act in concert to affect change. (p. 615)¶ Problem definition—what is the problem, who is to blame, what is the remedy—and rhetorical use in discourse are essential to the natures of both the concept of frame and the concept of ideograph. Given this shared nature, I treat ideographs and frames as identical concepts. In deference to the broad scholarly and popular usage of the term frame, I will henceforth use it instead of the word ideograph.¶ Frames gain currency in public policy discourse to the degree that they resonate with the conventional narratives of a culture; particular frames are not intelligible as narratives in cultures where they lack resonance (Polletta 2002, p. 34). Narrative expressions of frames are rendered in diverse modes of communication: written language (technical writing, journalistic writing, persuasive writing), speech (public speeches, conversations), visual images (still: photographs, drawings and diagrams; moving: animations, videos, films). These modes in turn are realized in diverse media: legal filings and decisions, policy white papers, newspapers, websites, and brochures. Each of these modes and media are suited to communicating particular styles of frames—for example the written language of policy white papers often conveys technical scientific discourses. Thus, when considering the frames that are present in public policy discourses, such as the debate over wind energy development in Vermont, it is necessary to analyze a dataset that reflects diverse meaning making practices.</p><p>The landscape fetish will end in climate disruption and mass extinction. Our false confidence in the harmony of nature is the source of our failure to limit violence against so called natural alterity as well as ourselves.<br/>Morton 11<br/>[Ecological Thought, first chapter]<br/>We've gotten it wrong so far—that's the truth of climate disruption and mass extinction. I don't advocate a return to premodern thinking. The ecological thought is modern. The paradox is that the modern era—let's sav it began around the late eighteenth century—impeded its own access to the ecological thought, even though the ecological thought will have been one of its lasting legacies. As far as ecology goes, modernity spent the last two and a half centuries tilting at windmills.The ghost of "Nature," a brand new entity dressed up like a relic from a past age, haunted the modernity in which it was born." This ghostly Nature inhibited the growth of the ecological thought. Only now, when contemporary capitalism and consumerism cover the entire earth and reach deeply into its life forms, is it possible, ironically and at last, to let go of this nonexistent ghost. Exorcise is good for you, and human beings are past the point at which Nature is a help. Our continued survival, and therefore the survival of the planet we're now dominating beyond all doubt, depends on our thinking past Nature.¶ Modern thinkers had taken it for granted that the ghost of Nature, rattling its chains, would remind them of a time without industry, a time without "technology," as if we had never used flint or wheat. But in looking at the ghost of Nature, modern humans were looking in a mirror. In Nature, thev saw the reflected, inverted image of their own age—and the grass is always greener on the other side. Nature was always "over yonder" alien and alienated.12 Just like a reflection, we can never actually reach it and touch it and belong to it. Nature was an ideal image, a self- contained form suspended afar, shimmering and naked behind glass like an expensive painting. In the idea of pristine wilderness, we can make out the mirror image of private property: Keep off the Grass, Do Not Touch, Not for Sale. Nature was a special kind of private property, without an owner, exhibited in a specially constructed art gallery. The gallery was Nature itself, revealed through visual technology in the eighteenth century as "picturesque" -looking like a picture." The "new and improved" version is art without an object, just an aura: the glow of value,14 Nature isn't what it claims to be.¶ While we're on the subject of Nature and "new and improved" upgrades, this book makes a rigorous distinction between environmentalism and ecology. By the time you finish, you may feel that there are good reasons for advocating not just ecology without nature but also ecology without environmentalism.¶ In Reflections on the Edge of Askja, Paul Skaulson relies us why we need Naturi-¶ lo live, to lie able to exist, the mind must connect itself with some kind of order. It must apprehend reality as an independent whole . . . and must bind itself in a stable fashion to certain features of what we call reality It cannot bind itself to the ordinary world of everyday experience, except by taking it on faith that reality forms an objective whole, a whole which exists independently of the mind. The mind lives, and we live, in a relationship of faith with reality itself. This relationship is likewise one of confidence in a detached reality, a reality which is different and other than the mind. We live and exist in this relationship of confidence, which is always by its nature uncertain and insecure... [This] relationship of confidence . . . is originally, and truly, always a relationship with reality as a natural totality as Nature."¶ It isn't hard to detect in this passage the violent, repetitive actions of someone desperate to restart a broken machine. Skulason cranks handles, attaches jumper cables, rolls it down a hill , . . it's not just what he says or even how he says it. It's the attitude with which he says it, the "subject position." From the tone of hope and fear, you can tell that the game is up and that he knows it. He is indulging in magical thinking: "If I just keep saying this in the right way, it'll be okay. Nature will exist." The desperation is legible in the sheer amount of writing. It goes on and on, waiting for something that never comes. It’s Nature writing reduced to Waiting for Godot: l must keep going. I can will Nature into existence, write it into the script." Skulason is living to cheer us up in the middle of the slow motion disaster we're facing. The more be says, the worse gets.¶ In the name of ecology, we must scrutinize Nature with all the suspicions modern person can muster. Let the buyer beware. Nature has turned out to be a plastic knockoff of the real thing. As Emmanuel Lévinas puts it in an astonishing passage that is among other things a passionate critique ot deep ecology's favorite philosopher, Martin Heidegger, our concepts of 'faceless generous mother nature" are based on "sedentary" agricultural societies with their idea of “possession.” The faceless mother provides the very motivation for our exploitation of Earth, seen as "inexhaustible mattter for things.

The system’s internal state of crisis and the rigorous screening that’s underway demand a new criterion in the name of which this screening and selection will be carried out. From one era to the next, the idea of virtue has never been anything but an invention of vice. Without ecology, how could we justify the existence of two different food regimes, one “healthy and organic” for the rich and their children, and the other notoriously toxic for the plebes, whose offspring are damned to obesity. The planetary hyper-bourgeoisie wouldn’t be able to make their normal lifestyle seem respectable if its latest caprices weren’t so scrupulously “respectful of the environment.” Without ecology, nothing would have enough authority to gag any and all objections to the exorbitant progress of control. Tracking, transparency, certification, eco-taxes, environmental excellence, and the policing of water, all give us an idea of the coming state of ecological emergency. Everything is permitted to a power structure that bases its authority in Nature, in health and in well-being. “Once the new economic and behavioral culture has become common practice, coercive measures will doubtless fall into disuse of their own accord.” You’d have to have all the ridiculous aplomb of a TV crusader to maintain such a frozen perspective and in the same breath incite us to feel sufficiently “sorry for the planet” to get mobilized, whilst remaining anesthetized enough to watch the whole thing with restraint and civility. The new green-asceticism is precisely the self-control that is required of us all in order to negotiate a rescue operation where the system has taken itself hostage. From now on, it’s in the name of environmentalism that we must all tighten our belts, just as we did yesterday in the name of the economy. The roads could certainly be transformed into bicycle paths, we ourselves could perhaps, to a certain degree, be grateful one day for a guaranteed income, but only at the price of an entirely therapeutic existence.

We enjoy the pain that we cannot know the turbine, and enjoy the turbine’s disruption of natural beauty. The sublime is the sentiment of pleasure at the failure to represent, pleasure from the pain of unpresentability. Beautiful aesthetics position the turbine as impure, corrupted by the human, and thus disruptive. Voting aff flips status quo aesthetics by enjoying that disruption, undermining the ideological basis of the landscape.<br/>Morton 11<br/>[The Ecological thought, first chapter]<br/>In Lakewood. Colorado, residents objected to the construction of a solar array in a park in 2008. because it didn't look "natural." Objections to wind farms are similar—made not because of the risk to birds but because they "spoil the view." A 2008 plan to put a wind farm near a remote Scottish island was well, scotched, because residents complained that their view would be destroyed. This is truly a case of the aesthetics of Nature impeding ecology and a good argument for why ecology must be without Nature. Why is a wind turbine less beautiful than an oil pipe? Why does it "spoil the view" any more than pipes and roads?¶ You could see turbines as environmental art. Wind chimes play in the wind, some environmental sculptures sway and rock in the breeze. Wind farms have a slightly frightening size and magnificence. One could easily read them as embodying the aesthetics of the sublime (rather than the beautiful). But it's an ethical sublime that says, "We humans choose not to use carbon"—a choice visible in gigantic turbines. Perhaps it's this very visibility of choice that makes wind farms disturbing: visible choice, rather than secret pipes. running under an apparently undisturbed "landscape” (a word for a painting, not actual trees and water).

P. 77-9]<br/>The sublime sentiment, which is also the sentiment of the sublime, is, according to Kant, a strong and equivocal emotion: it carries with it both pleasure and pain. Better still, in it pleasure derives from pain. Within the tradition of the subject, which comes from Augustine and Descartes and which Kant does not radically challenge, this contra- diction, which some would call neurosis or masochism, develops as a conflict between the faculties of a subject, the faculty to conceive of something and the faculty to "present" something. Knowledge exists if, first, the statement is intelligible, and second, if "cases" can be derived from the experience which "corresponds" to it. Beauty exists if a certain "case" (the work of art), given first by the sensi- bility without any conceptual determination, the sentiment of plea- sure independent of any interest the work may elicit, appeals to the principle of a universal consensus (which may never be attained).¶ Taste, therefore, testifies that between the capacity to conceive and the capacity to present an object corresponding to the concept, n undetermined agreement, without rules, giving rise to a judgment which Kant calls reflective, may be experienced as pleasure. The sublime is a different sentiment. It takes place, on the contrary, when the imagination fails to present an object which might, if only in principle, come to match a concept. We have the Idea of the world (the totality of what is), but we do not have the capacity to show an example of it. We have the Idea of the simple (that which cannot be broken down, decomposed), but we cannot illustrate it with a sensible object which would be a "case" of it. We can conceive the infinitely great, the infinitely powerful, but every presentation of an object destined to "make visible" this absolute greatness or power appears to us painfully inadequate. Those are Ideas of which no presentation is possible. Therefore, they impart no knowledge about reality (ex- perience); they also prevent the free union of the faculties which gives rise to the sentiment of the beautiful; and they prevent the for- mation and the stabilization of taste. They can be said to be unpre- sentable.¶ I shall call modern the art which devotes its "little technical ex- pertise" &#123;son "petit technique"), as Diderot used to say, to present the fact that the unpresentable exists. To make visible that there is something which can be conceived and which can neither be seen nor made visible: this is what is at stake in modern painting. But how to make visible that there is something which cannot be seen? Kant himself shows the way when he names "formlessness, the absence of form," as a possible index to the unpresentable. He also says of the empty "abstraction" which the imagination experiences when in search for a presentation of the infinite (another unpresentable): this abstraction itself is like a presentation of the infinite, its "nega- tive presentation." He cites the commandment, "Thou shalt not make graven images" &#123;Exodus), as the most sublime passage in the Bible in that it forbids all presentation of the Absolute. Little needs to be added to those observations to outline an aesthetic of sublime paintings. As painting, it will of course "present" something though negatively; it will therefore avoid figuration or representation. It will be "white" like one of Malevitch's squares; it will enable us to see only by making it impossible to see; it will please only by causing pain. One recognizes in those instructions the axioms of avant-gardes in painting, inasmuch as they devote themselves to making an allusion to the un- presentable by means of visible presentations. The systems in the name of which, or with which, this task has been able to support or to justify itself deserve the greatest attention; but they can originate only in the vocation of the sublime in order to legitimize it, that is, to conceal it. They remain inexplicable without the incommensurability of reality to concept which is implied in the Kantian philosophy of the sublime.¶ It is not my intention to analyze here in detail the manner in which the various avant-gardes have, so to speak, humbled and dis- qualified reality by examining the pictorial techniques which are so many devices to make us believe in it. Local tone, drawing, the mixing of colors, linear perspective, the nature of the support and that of the instrument, the treatment, the display, the museum: the avant-gardes are perpetually flushing out artifices of presentation which make it possible to subordinate thought to the gaze and to turn it away from the unpresentable. If Habermas, like Marcuse, understands this task of derealization as an aspect of the (repressive) "desublimation" which characterizes the avant-garde, it is because he confuses the Kantian sublime with Freudian sublimation, and because aesthetics has remained for him that of the beautiful.</p><p>The Ballot is a decision on Aesthetic Education. Vote for the team that provides the best aesthetic training. Aesthetic tastes create the possibility or impossibility of genocidal violence.

The presenting of the unpresentable wind turbine is an aesthetic performance the neg can read disads to – just google some keywords like wind, nature, sublime, aesthetics and the bibliography is a mile long. <br/>Lyotard 74<br/>[The Postmodern Condition. P. 81-2]<br/>The postmodern would be that which, in the modern, puts for- ward the unpresentable in presentation itself; that which denies itself¶ the solace of good forms, the consensus of a taste which would make (\ it possible to share collectively the nostalgia for the unattainable;¶ that which searches for new presentations, not in order to enjoy * them but in order to impart a stronger sense of the unpresentable. A postmodern artist or writer is in the position of a philosopher: the¶ text he writes, the work he produces are not in principle governed by preestablished rules, and they cannot be judged according to a deter- mining judgment, by applying familiar categories to the text or to¶ the work. Those rules and categories are what the work of art itself is looking for. The artist and the writer, then, are working without rules in order to formulate the rules of what will have been done. Hence the fact that work and text have the characters of an event; hence also, they always come too late for their author, or, what amounts to the same thing, their being put into work, their realiza-¶ tion &#123;mise en oeuvre) always begin too soon. Post modern would¶ have to be understood according to the paradox of the future &#123;post) anterior &#123;modo).¶ It seems^to me that the essay (Montaigne) is postmodern, while the fragment &#123;The Athaeneum) is modern.¶ Finally, it must be clear that it is our business not to supply reality but to invent allusions to the conceivable which cannot be presented. And it is not to be expected that this task will effect the last reconciliation between language games (which, under the name of faculties, Kant knew to be separated by a chasm), and that only the transcendental illusion (that of Hegel) can hope to totalize them into a real unity. But Kant also knew that the price to pay for such an illusion is terror. The nineteenth and twentieth centuries have given us as much terror as we can take. We have paid a high enough price for the nostalgia of the whole and the one, for the reconciliation of the concept and the sensible, of the transparent and the communicable experience. Under the general demand for slackening and for appease- ment, we can hear the mutterings of the desire for a return of terror, for the realization of the fantasy to seize reality. The answer is: Let us wage a war on totality; let us be witnesses to the unpresentable; let us activate the differences and save the honor of the name.</p><p>Creative crisis is what makes debate revolutionize itself – exclusion of aesthetic education is terror that makes debate static and education genocidal. There is no pure or natural policy debate. What is most valuable for debate is generating new questions and new ideas – the riches behind our aesthetic training cannot be imagined or calculated because they will create new criteria of imagination.<br/>Lyotard 74<br/>[The Postmodern Condition. 63-4.]<br/>Of course, it does not always happen like this in reality. Countless¶ scientists have seen their "move" ignored or repressed, sometimes for¶ decades, because it too abruptly destabilized the accepted positions,¶ not only in the university and scientific hierarchy, but also in the¶ 221¶ problematic. The stronger the “move” the more likely it is to be¶ denied the minimum consensus, precisely because it changes the rules of the game upon which consensus had been based. But when the institution of knowledge functions in this manner, it is acting like an ordinary power center whose behavior is governed by a principle of homeostasis.¶ Such behavior is terrorist, as is the behavior of the system de- scribed by Luhmann. By terror I mean the efficiency gained by elimi- nating, or threatening to eliminate, a player from the language game one shares with him. He is silenced or consents, not because he has been refuted, but because his ability to participate has been threat- ened (there are many ways to prevent someone from playing). The decision makers' arrogance, which in principle has no equivalent in the sciences, consists in the exercise of terror. It says: "Adapt your¶ 222¶ aspirations to our ends—or else."¶ Even permissiveness toward the various games is made condition-¶ al on performativity. The redefinition of the norms of life consists in enhancing the system's competence for power. That this is the case is particularly evident in the introduction of telematics tech- nology: the technocrats see in telematics a promise of liberalization and enrichment in the interactions between interlocutors; but what makes this process attractive for them is that it will result in new tensions in the system, and these will lead to an improvement in its performativity.223¶ To the extent that science is differential, its pragmatics provides the antimodel of a stable system. A statement is deemed worth re- taining the moment it marks a difference from what is already known, and after an argument and proof in support of it has been found. Science is a model of an "open system," in which a statement becomes relevant if it "generates ideas," that is, if it generates other statements and other game rules. Science possesses no general metalanguage in which all other languages can be transcribed and evaluated. This is what prevents its identification with the system and, all things considered, with terror. If the division between decision makers and executors exists in the scientific community (and it does), it is a fact of the socioeconomic system and not of the pragmatics of science itself. It is in fact one of the major obstacles to the imagina- tive development of knowledge.¶&nbsp;</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h3 id="HIndianaRound1" class="wikigeneratedheader"><span>Indiana Round 1</span></h3><p>Contention One is the Unspoiled Landscape</p><p>First is our thesis: Aesthetic evaluations are required now in considering changes to the environment or landscape – it doesn’t matter what the benefits of the project may be, the government has absolute discretion to reject “eyesores” – this is in the context of energy developments</p><p>Walworth ‘6, “Case Note: Regulating Aesthetics of Coastal Maine: Kroeger v. Department of Environmental Protection”, (J.D. University of Maine, Law Review), North Dakota Law Review, 85 N. Dak. L. Rev. 329</p><p>Aesthetics finally were explicitly addressed in the dicta of Berman v. Parker. n53 Justice Douglas argued that the concept of the public welfare must include aesthetics and that legislatures ought to control and protect beauty in their communities: "[t]he concept of public welfare is broad and inclusive. The values it represents are spiritual as well as physical, [*106] aesthetic as well as monetary." n54 Berman led commentators to debate the lasting effects of the dicta: had it sanctioned aesthetics legislation under the general welfare power or did it lack constitutional support? n55 The question inspired by Berman was addressed in the notable and more recent case of Metromedia Inc. v. City of San Diego, where a billboard ordinance regulating specific types of signs was overturned for violating the First Amendment. n56 Despite the free speech focus of the case, the majority also recognized aesthetic regulations as a "substantial government goal," effectively affirming aesthetic regulations as a permissible government function. n57 It is important to note that the Court in Metromedia acknowledged the risk of aesthetic regulations: with the acceptance of aesthetic notions as permissible goals comes the danger that regulations can be based on subjective rationales that defy "objective evaluation." n58 The Court pointed out that this risk mandates aesthetics be scrutinized carefully "to determine if they are only a public rationalization of an impermissible purpose" that would not fall within the police powers. n59 These "impermissible purposes" have been the subject of much litigation, as demonstrated by state court cases below.¶ C. Approach by State Jurisdictions: The Ancillary and Primary Views¶ Berman heralded a growing awareness of the importance of aesthetics regulation in American society. Federal action soon followed: Congress passed the National Environmental Policy Act, n60 the Wild and Scenic [*107] Rivers Act, n61 the National Trails System Act, n62 and the Coastal Zone Management Act, n63 all to protect the environment against public and private mistreatment. n64 States soon became involved as well, and as of the 1960s, legislatures were passing statutes protecting wetlands. n65 State regulation even went so far as to focus regulations on locations ranging from golf courses to battlefields. n66 The new legislation had to pass judicial scrutiny for impermissible purposes, however, and two judicial approaches towards aesthetic regulation began to emerge under the police powers: the ancillary approach and the primary approach. n67 In some jurisdictions, aesthetic regulations were deemed ancillary to health and safety components of the police powers. n68 Conversely, other jurisdictions devised an "aesthetics alone" approach, making aesthetics the primary purpose for regulations under the general welfare police power. n69 During the mid-1990s, the trend in jurisdictions was to utilize the primary over the ancillary approach in aesthetic regulation cases. n70 The ancillary approach focuses on the health and safety functions of the police power first, with aesthetics second. For instance, the Court of Appeals of New York linked billboard regulation to issues relating to traffic safety, such as clear visibility and distraction prevention, although it [*108] acknowledged the blight billboards created on motorways was akin to "a plague of locusts." n71 Where developments near or on natural resources are challenged, some jurisdictions addressed the public health and safety issues first, and included scenic uses last. n72 Scenic areas often overlap with natural resource areas, creating an "easy alliance" between aesthetics and environmental protection. n73 In Oswego Properties, Inc. v. City of Lake Oswego, n74 the City denied a housing development plan to build a forty-four foot wall in the proximity of existing trees because it failed to satisfy the city's open space requirement. n75 The court held that the city's standard of maintaining aesthetic appearances justified the protection of the nearby trees. n76 Other jurisdictions such as Arkansas have also accepted the promotion of tourism as a basis for regulations protecting the visual landscape, rather than aesthetics alone. n77 In Donnrey Communications Co. v. City of Fayetteville, ordinances regulating outdoor advertising advanced the legitimate government interest in tourism and aesthetics. n78 In its opinion, the court took note that the city's board of directors had deemed billboards as not only ill equipped mechanisms to provide useful information to tourists, but also objects detrimental to the scenic resources [*109] that attracted tourists to the city in the first place. n79 Although the case of Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council n80 admittedly focused on a takings and compensation challenge to South Carolina's total ban on coastal development rather than a specific aesthetic regulation, both aesthetics and tourism were among the numerous factors behind the state's Beachfront Management Act that prohibited new development below an established erosion line. n81 Despite reversal on appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, n82 the Supreme Court of South Carolina deemed preservation of "this existing public resource . . . a 'laudable goal.'" n83¶ The primary approach advances protection of visual resources as its chief objective and suggests that the general welfare prong of the police powers includes aesthetics. n84 Regulations of eyesores such as junkyards and wind turbines pass judicial scrutiny for solely aesthetic purposes. In Oregon, for instance, the Supreme Court upheld an ordinance regulating a wrecking yard for purely aesthetic purposes. n85 In the case In re Halnon, the Supreme Court of Vermont upheld the Vermont Public Service Board's denial of a certificate to build a wind turbine based on the adverse aesthetic impact it would have on the environment. n86 The New Hampshire Supreme Court has been explicit in its acceptance of the primary approach. In Asselin v. Town of Conway, n87 where a sign owner protested the municipality's directives regarding lighted signage, the court stated, "We now conclude that municipalities may validly exercise zoning power solely to advance aesthetic values, because the preservation or enhancement of the visual environment may promote the general welfare." n88 Asselin was cited by the Court in the more recent case of Taylor v. Town of Plaistow, where a zoning ordinance required a distance of 1,000 feet between car dealerships for purely aesthetic reasons. n89</p><p>This process has always rejected wind turbines as “unappealing” or “hideous” – this is formed out of the way we see the environment as an interconnected universal idea</p><p>Brisman ‘5, “The Aesthetics of Wing Energy Systems”, (J.D.

Some philosophers have dedicated their whole careers to discussing and writing about "aesthetics." n233 Thus, it is well beyond the scope of this Article to provide even a basic introduction to the elements of the branch of philosophy called "aesthetics." n234 Nevertheless, it is worthwhile to present a definition of "aesthetics" to ground our discussion of the aesthetic precedent for wind energy systems. According to Allen Carlson:¶ ¶ Aesthetics is the area of philosophy that concerns our appreciation of things as they affect our senses, and especially as they affect them in a pleasing way. As such it frequently focuses primarily on the fine arts, the products of which are traditionally designed to please our senses. However, much of our aesthetic appreciation is not confined to art, but directed towards the world at large. We appreciate not only art, but also nature - broad horizons, fiery sunsets, and towering mountains. Moreover, our appreciation reaches beyond pristine nature to our more mundane surroundings: the solitude of a neighborhood park on a rainy evening, the chaos of a bustling morning marketplace, the view from the road. n235¶ ¶ [*82] In Part III, this Article identified two types of negative visual aesthetic responses to wind farms, echoing Carlson's definition of aesthetics. Whereas some individuals dislike the structural form of wind turbines and regard them as unappealing objects of fine art ("I can't believe how large and hideous they are . . . . They look like alien monsters coming out of the ground."), n236 others object to turbines because of turbines' impact on their aesthetic appreciation of the landscape ("a blight on unspoiled mountainsides and seascapes"). n237 While at least one commentator has noted that "the pinwheel-like motion of . . . wind plants is a source of playful visual interest to many," n238 and while one could make a fairly convincing argument that the meditative experience of this pinwheel-like motion resembles the contemplative encounter with one of George Rickey's kinetic sculptures (such as Summer III (1963); Sedge IV (1964); Two Lines - Temporal I (1964); Five Lines in Parallel Planes (1965); Six Lines in a T (1965-66); Peristyle II (1966); Two Vertical, Three Horizontal Lines (1966)), n239 or with one of the mobiles of Alexander Calder (such as Non-Objective (1947); Object in Y (1955); Red, 1959 (1959); Antennae with Red and Blue Dots (1960)), n240 Lynn Chadwick (Dragonfly (1951)), n241 or Kenneth Martin (Small Screw Mobile (1953); Screw Mobile with Black Centre, (ca. 1958-65)), n242 this [*83] Article is more interested in demonstrating how an exposure to certain artworks might affect the sentiment that wind turbines disrupt the "purity" of the landscape or "spoil" the view.</p><p>This logic justifies religious, selfish, and identity based violence that operates outside of and above conceptions of morality</p><p>Kateb 2000 [George, Aestheticism and Morality: Their Cooperation and Source: Political Theory, Vol. 28, No. 1 (Feb., 2000), pp. 5-37Published by: Sage Publications, Inc.Stable URL: <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../www.jstor.org/stable/192282Accessed" tppabs="http://www.jstor.org/stable/192282Accessed"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.jstor.org/stable/192282Accessed</span></a></span>]</p><p>Other ideals that are unconsciously or theoretically raised above morality can be suggested. I do not have the whole list. The reason for talking about them in this essay is really to propose that all of these ideals are, to some extent, aesthetic. None is completely aesthetic, but all are partly so. Aesthetic motives help to animate pursuit of ideals that are untheorized but enacted, or theoretically defended, at large moral cost, that are loved more than morality or are so loved that the moral cost does not break into consciousness with any force. If I am right, then the place to begin the discussion of the cooperation and hostility between aestheticism and morality is with the hostility, which is, I believe, the main part of the story. Both unconscious immorality and ration-alizations of the (ostensibly nonaesthetic) supra-moral are helped along by unconscious aestheticism. A more conscious aestheticism, on the other hand, may be either more self-limiting and hence less productive of immorality or, by being given its proper name, more easy to denounce and resist. But these last speculations are uncertain. I say, then, that despite all denials and failures of recognition, some part of the passion for religious faith, for the preservation or expansion of a way of life or a solidary group identity, for politics as an end in itself, for the project of masculinity, for acquiring the pleasures of a symbolic life, for rising in the world as a great individual, or, finally, for saving nature from the predatory verminous human race is aesthetic. All these salient (or potentially salient) features of the human record, theorized or unconsciously enacted, are to be accounted for, in part, by what I shall call aesthetic cravings. These cravings, seeking satisfactiono r gratification, help to swell the amounto f unconscious or rationalized immorality in the world. (To repeat, I am talking about pur-suits that are immoral but not preponderantly egotistical, selfish, or person-ally vicious, pursuits that involve numbers of people who act idealistically. In the case of extremist and assertive individualism, the will to play one's role to the limit-an aesthetic craving-often is a good deal more important than mere egotism or lack of scruples.) When I maintain that unconscious aes-theticism is responsible for a substantial amount of the world's wickedness, am I saying something surprising or something obvious? I cannot tell. But if the claim is obvious, then I still think that it needs repeating and explaining. If it is surprising, then it needs explaining all the more. For the moment my theme is unconscious (or indeliberate or un-self-aware) aestheticism. Even when the immoral supra-moral is theorized, the ideal, whatever it might be, is not recognized as aesthetic except occasionally by a rare theorist such as Nietzsche or Hegel, and then not continuously. The immoralism of the latter two is steady, but their characterization of its motiva-tion as aesthetic is not steady.</p><p>The idea that a harmonious and authentic nature that can be accessed is so vague and unknowable that it can be enlisted in the most conservative, racist and terrifying violence in the name of the natural.</p><p>Morton 7</p><p>[Ecology without Nature, p. 14-17]</p><p>One of the ideas inhibiting genuinely ecological politics, ethics, philosophy, and art is the idea of nature itself. Nature, a transcendental term in a material mask, stands at the end of a potentially infinite series of other terms that collapse into it, otherwise known as a metonymic list: fish, grass, mountain air, chimpanzees, love, soda water, freedom of choice, heterosexuality, free markets . . . Nature. A metonymic series becomes a metaphor. Writing conjures this notoriously slippery term, useful to ideologies of all kinds in its very slipperiness, in its refusal to maintain any consistency.11 But consistency is what nature is all about, on another level. Saying that something is unnatural is saying that it does not conform to a norm, so "normal" that it is built into the very fabric of things as they are. So "nature" occupies at least three places in symbolic language. First, it is a mere empty placeholder for a host of other concepts. Second, it has the force of law, a norm against which deviation is measured. Third, "nature" is a Pandora's box, a word that encapsulates a potentially infinite series of disparate fantasy objects. It is this third sense—nature as fantasy—that this book most fully engages. A "discipline" of diving into the Rorschach blobs of others' enjoyment that we commonly call poems seems a highly appropriate way of beginning to engage with how "nature" compels feelings and beliefs.¶ Nature wavers m between the divine and the material. Far from being something "natural" itself, nature hovers over things like a ghost. It slides over the infinite list of things that evoke it. Nature is thus not unlike "the subject," a being who searches through the entire üniverse for its reflection, only to find none. If it is just another word for supreme authority, then why not just call it God? But if this God is nothing outside the material world, then why not just call it matter? This was the political dilemma in which Spinoza, and the deists of eighteenth-century Europe, found themselves,- Being an "out" atheist was very dangerous in the eighteenth century, as evidenced by the cryptic remarks of Hume and the increasingly cautious approach of Percy Shelley, who had been expelled from Oxford for publishing a pamphlet on atheism. God often appeared on the side of royal au- thority, and the rising bourgeoisie and associated revolutionary classes wanted another way of being authoritative. "Ecology without nature" means in part that we try to confront some of the intense notions which nature smudges.¶ Ecological writing is fascinated with the idea of something that exists in between polarized terms such as God and matter, this and that, sub-ject and object. I find John Locke's critique of the idea of ether to be helpful here. Locke's critique appeared toward the beginning of the modern construction of space as an empty set of point coordinates. Numerous holes in materialist, atomist theories were filled by some thing elemental. Newton's gravity worked because of an ambient ether that transmitted the properties of heavy bodies instantaneously, in an analogy for (or as an aspect off the love of an omnipresent God.14 If ether is a kind of "ambient fluid" that surrounds all particles, existing in between" them, then what surrounds the particles of ambient fluid themselves?) If nature is sandwiched between terms such as God and immer, what medium keeps the things that are natural sandwiched to- gether? Nature appears to be both lettuce and mayonnaise. Ecological writing shuffles subject and object back and forth so that we may think they have dissolved into each other, though what we usually end up with is a blur this book calls ambience.¶ Later in the modern period, the idea of the nation-state emerged as a way of going beyond the authority of the monarch. The nation all too often depends upon the very same list that evokes the idea of nature. Nature and nation are very closely intertwined. I show how ecocritique could examine the ways in which nature does not necessarily take us outside society, but actually forms the bedrock of nationalist enjoyment. Nature, practically a synonym for evil in the Middle Ages, was considered the basis of social good by the Romantic period. According to numerous writers such as Rousseau, the framers of the social con- tract start out in a state of nature, the fact that this state is not much different from the "concrete jungle" of actual historical circumstance has not escaped attention.¶ In the Enlightenment, nature became a way of establishing racial and sexual identity, and science became the privileged way of demonstrating it. The normal was set up as different from the pathological along the coordinates of the natural and the unnatural.lb Nature, by then a scientific term, put a stop to argument or rational inquiry: "Well, it’s just in my nature." He is ideological, you are prejudiced, but my ideas are natural. A metaphorical use of Thomas Malthus in the work of Charles Darwin, for example, naturalized, and continues to naturalize, the workings of the "invisible hand" of the free market and the "survival of the fittest"—which is always taken to mean the competitive war of all (owners) against all (workers). Malthus used nature to argue against the continuation of early modern welfare, m a document produced tor the government of his age. Sadly, this very thinking is now being used to push down the poor yet further, in the battle of the supposedly ecologically minded against "population growth" (and immigration). Nature, achieved obliquely through turning metonymy into metaphor, becomes an oblique way of talking about politics. What is presented as straightforward, "unmarked," beyond contestation, is warped.¶ One of the basic problems with nature is that it could be considered either as a substance, as a squishy thing in itself, or as essence, as an abstract principle that transcends the material realm and even the realm of representation. Edmund Burke considers substance as the stuff of nature in his writing on the sublime.27 This "substantiahsm" asserts that there is at least one actually existing thing that embodies a sublime quality (vastness, terror, magnificence). Substantialism tends to pro- mote a monarchist or authoritarian view that there is an external thing to which the subject should bow. Essentialism, on the other hand, has its champion in Immanuel Kant. The sublime thing can never be represented, and indeed, in certain religions, says Kant, there is a prohibition against trying (Judaism, Islam). This essentialism turns out to be politically liberating, on the side of revolutionary republicanism.21 On the¶ whole, nature writing, and its precursors and family members, mostly in phenomenological and/or Romantic writing, has tended to favor a substantialist view of nature—it is palpable and there—despite the ex- plicit politics of the author. Further work in ecocritique should delineate a republican, nonsubstantialist countertradition running through writers such as Milton and Shelley, for whom nature did not stand in for an authority for which you sacrifice your autonomy and reason.¶ Ecological forms of subjectivity involve ideas and decisions about group identity and behavior. Subjectivity is not simply an individual, and certainly not just an individualist, phenomenon. It is a collective one. Environmental writing is a way of registering the feeling of being surrounded by others, or more abstractly, by an otherness, some- thing that is not the self. Although it may displace the actual social col- lective and choose to write about surrounding mountains instead, such displacements always say something about the kinds of collective life that ecological writing is envisaging. Fredric Jameson outlines the necessity for criticism to work on ideas of collectivity:¶ Anyone who evokes the ultimate value of the community or the collectivity from a left perspective must face three problems: 11 how to distin- guish this position radically from communitarianism; Z) how to differentiate the collective project from fascism or nazism; 3) how to relate the social and rhe economic level—that is, how to use the Marxist analysis of capitalism to demonstrare the unviability of social solutions within that stratem. As for collective identities, in a historical moment in which individual personal identity has been unmasked as a decentered local of multiple subject positions, surely it is not too much to ask that something analogous be conceptualized on the collective level.2'¶ The idea of the environment is more or less a way of considering groups and collectives—humans surrounded by nature, or in continuity with other beings such as animals and plants. It is about being-with. As La- tour has recently pointed out, however, the actual situation is far more drastically collective than that. All kinds of beings, from toxic waste to sea snails, are clamoring for our scientific, political, and artistic attention, and have become part of political lite—to the detriment of mono- lithic conceptions of Nature.,n To write about ecology is to write about society, and not simply m the weak sense that our ideas of ecology are social constructions. Historical conditions have abolished an extra- social nature to which theories of society can appeal, while at the same time making the beings that tell under this heading impinge ever more urgently upon society.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The idea of “nature” presumes an intelligent designer – this causes an annihilation of difference – what does not jive with the intelligent natural design becomes metaphysically demonic and must be eliminated.</p><p>Morton 7</p><p>[Ecology without Nature, p. 18-0]</p><p>The more we study it. the more we see that, beyond the fact that many different people have many different opinions about it, nature in itself flickers between things—it is both/and or neither/nor. This flickering affects how we write about it. Nature is . . . animals, trees, the weather . . . the bioregion, the ecosystem. It is both the set and the con tents of the set. It is the world and the entities in that world. It appears like a ghost at the never-arriving end of an infinite series: crabs, waves, lightning, rabbits, silicon . . . Nature. Of all things, nature should be natural. But we cannot point to it. What we usually get is a suggestive effusion on something "Whose dwelling is in the light ot setting suns, /¶ In the round ocean, and the living air, / And the blue sky, and in the mind of man," as Wordsworth marvelously put it.12 Nature becomes supernatural, a process made clear in John Carta's decisive treatment ot the history of Puritan ideas about nature and wilderness (though Gatta sets aside the more radical Puritan possibilities of the Diggers, the mystic Jacob Bochme and the vegetarian Thomas Tryon)." Or nature dissolves and we are left with sheer matter, and a sequence of ideas with numerous high points in radical materialist philosophy, such as Spinoza. We want there to be something in berween. But would that be natural? Would it not be supernatural? Would that be supernatural like a spirit—more of a refined essence—or a ghost—something more sub- stantial, maybe made of ectoplasm? We could go on splitting hairs infi- nitely. Our journey to the middle, of the "in between" space, whatever we call it, would go on generating binary pairs, and we would always be coming down on one side or the other, missing the exact center. It does not matter whether this is materialist spirituality, or spiritual materialism. Thinking posits something "over there" that maintains a mysterious allure.¶ Since the Romantic period, nature has been used to support the capitalist theory of value and to undermine it; to point out what is intrinsically human, and to exclude the human; to inspire kindness and compassion, and to justify competition and cruelty. It is easy to see why M. H. Ahrams would have written a book on Romantic poetry called Natural Supernaturalism. In short, nature has been on both sides of the equation ever since it was invented. Ecology without Nature takes nature out of the equation by exploring the ways in which literary' writing tries to conjure it up. We discover how nature always slips out of reach in the very act of grasping it. At the very moment at which writing seems to be dissolving in the face of the compelling reality it is describing, writing overwhelms what it is depicting and makes it impossible to find anything behind its opaque texture. Even as it establishes a middle ground "in between" terms such as subject and object, or inside and outside nature without fail excludes certain terms, thus reproducing the difference between inside and outside in other ways.'4 Just when it brings us into proximity with the nonhuman "other," nature reestablishes a comfortable distance between "us" and "them." With ecological friends like this, who needs enemies?¶ Some will accuse me of being a postmodernist, by which they will mean that I believe that the world is made of text, that there is nothing real. Nothing could be further from the truth. The idea of nature is all too real, and it has an all too real effect upon all too real beliefs, practices, and decisions in the all too real world. True, I claim that there is no such "thing" as nature, it by nature we mean some thing that is single, independent, and lasting. But deluded ideas and ideological fixations do exist. "Nature" is a focal point that compels us to assume cer- tain attitudes. Ideology resides in the attitude we assume toward this fascinating object. By dissolving the object, we render the ideological fixation inoperative. At least, that is the plan.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The idea of nature is so pure and ecstatic that it demands genocidal violence.

In his criticism of Sheldon Wolin, Connolly argues that it may in fact be:¶ A quick tempo of life, to put it bluntly, that sets a crucial condition of possibility for the vibrant practice of democratic pluralism. [Connolly’s] wager is that it is more possible to negotiate a democratic ethos con- gruent with the accelerated tempo of modern life than it is either to slow the world down or to insulate the majority of people from the effects of speed.¶ (Connolly, 2002: 162)¶ Slowing down the world will come at a cost. The nostalgia for a simpler or slower life often inspires a rogues gallery of enemies and scapegoats to blame for the failure of restoration movements (ibid.: 162). In part, this is because the pace of life is not solely under the dominion of human control. Life has a life of its own. But failure to constrain life’s unpredictability and acceleration leads to the redirection of energies of ressentiment to the vilification of those identied with the acceleration of life. Across the political landscape one can observe the Right blaming queer lives for the breakdown of ‘stable’ families and from the Left the scapegoating of technophiles and scientists for destroying nature and human authenticity.¶ This seems true of Habermas who, from his chosen perspective of the ‘Future Present’, can consider evolution and change only in apocalyptic terms. The fear of change and of the unpredictable expresses a kind of revul- sion toward life. And life is nothing if not mutable and aleatory. Connolly’s political theorist as seer also attempts to peer into the future, but the seer looks for incipient possibilities not catastrophic certainties. Instead the political theorist as seer ‘reviews forking moments, not apparent to most participants when things are still open’ (Connolly, forthcoming: 9).</p><p>Plan</p><p>The United States federal government should remove restrictions on wind energy production based on adverse aesthetic evaluations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Contention Two is The Challenge</p><p>Status quo aesthetic politics are IMMENSLEY dangerous—it claims that a myopic, Western view of beauty and thought is universally applicable.</p><p>The effects of this sort of false consciousness cannot be understated<del>Our conception of what is aesthetically “good” or “bad” ORGANIZES and DOMINATES all other spheres of thought and inquiry—from education to politics to philosophy to morality. &nbsp;EVERY DECISION WE MAKE is influenced by our aesthetic tastes—when something just “feels” right, or a plan “looks good” or an idea “resonates with you”, that is the aesthetic of Western domination at work.</del></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Taylor, 1998 [Clyde R.

The application of this axiom came to politics, religion, law, journalism, science, sports, history, psychiatry, criminology, and many other fields of knowledge before it approached the aesthetic, defended by its definition as an autonomous sphere with rules of its own. We may conclude, however, that when such interroga­tions collide with the aesthetic, the potential damage is all the greater, because of its character as a construct without a ground in reality apart from its own self-assertion.¶ Awareness mounts that the aesthetic is an eighteenth-century bour­geois construction (taken over from aristocratic beginnings) for the con­trol of knowledge, specifically of the "beautiful." The central place set aside for the aesthetic experience in the arena of culture is increasingly identified with the ruler-of-the-roost posture assumed by imperial West­ern knowledge. The position occupied by the man of taste scrutinizing the art-object reverberates the arrogance of the subject-object relation in Western philosophical discourse, describing the distinction between the thinker and the thing being thought. For artist and theorist Laura Kipnis, then, aesthetics "is a key instance in the formation of the bourgeois sub­ject and in the constitution of subject positions from which first world domination is effected and reproduced."' The enabling event of the aes­thetic was the construction of this subjective individualism. "In the po‑ litical realm of reality," notes Susan Kappeler, "very different values ad­here to the possibilities of subject and object: the role of the subject means power, action, freedom, the role of the object powerlessness, domination, oppression. The two roles are not equally desirable. Hence the role of sub­ject constitutes a site for a power struggle."'¶ But the invention of the aesthetic first appealed to its fashioners as an alternative to power. The aesthetic emerged out of a fusion of concepts of morality and beauty, inherited from the neo-Platonist ideas of the Ren­aissance; a crucial difference however was that the morality of the first aesthetic philosophers was more thoroughly secular than seventeenth-century neo-Platonic thinkers whose notions of beauty and morality were more spiritual, deeply implicated with ideas of the soul. English­man Francis Hutcheson, who is credited with being the first moderm philosopher of the aesthetic, indicated by his titles the chief concerns of the new discipline. Inquiry Concerning Beauty, Order, Harmony and Design was the first part of his An Inquiry into the Original of Our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue (1725).¶ The aesthetic became a philosophical growth industry, although it should be noted that the concept has never existed without formidable philosophical refutations.' As it grew, it incorporated ideas about the imagination, taste, morality, beauty, art, the senses, into an expansive category of knowledge and experience. The ecstatic spread of aesthetics in European thought profited from the appeal to (and maybe the corrup­tion of) the desire for beauty, for sensory satisfaction for an emerging up­per middle class whose accumulations of wealth and power were out­growing their pioneering values of puritanical self-denial. The seduction of the aesthetic as a body of principles concerning taste also served the desire to regulate social distinction for a class which, having gotten money, now hungered for status. White British theorist Terry Eagleton makes the compelling argument that, having acquired dominance in the material sphere, the bourgeoisie used the aesthetic to extend control over the senses and the feelings of interior life, thus ensuring further compli­ance with its social order.'¶ The opacity of the aesthetic, its endless definitions and clarifications, may be reduced by noting its two institutionalized functions. One bound­ary of meaning organizes it as a foundational principle in art criticism. The other reference, the philosophical, relates it to cognition, in which a space of contemplation is marked out as characterized by the aesthetic gaze or experience. In most of its incarnations, this aesthetic gaze is iden­tified as disinterested, removed from considerations of politics, money,self-interest, in favor of a higher inquiry. The ideal object of this aesthetic experience is autonomous, autotelic, an end in itself, when bracketed by the gaze of the observer. It is both transcendent and universal, un­bounded by history or geography.¶ The capacity for aesthetic appreciation, placing a priority on form over function, is, as Bourdieu notes, a disposition affordable by individuals who have lifted themselves above the imperatives of necessity and sur­vival—is in fact, celebrated as a sign of that deliverance.' The aesthetic disposition functions as a base for the fabrication and exploitation of countless social distinctions separating the cognoscenti from the be­nighted, the privileged from the pitiful, the elect from the damned, through what Baudrillard calls a "political economy of signs."' Grounded in this base is the mechanically reproduced normative superiority of bourgeois knowledge, experience, and practice. The aesthetic, then, is a system of representation and reception encoding the world for the spectator posi­tion of the Western upper middle class. Or as seen by Susan Kappeler from a slightly different angle, "culture, as we know it, is patriarchy's self-image."'¶ But the aesthetic serves an even more powerful function than individu­alistic self-empowerment. Not only is the aesthetic an ideology, it gives crucial support to general ideological stability. Hadjinicolaou points out "different spheres or forms of the ideological level: for example, the moral, legal, political, religious, economic, philosophical and aesthetic spheres. The process by which one sphere dominates the others is ex­tremely complex."' Despite this complexity, it is plain to see the role of the aesthetic in uniting, rationalizing, legitimating—bringing order to these other levels. Just as the aesthetic arose as a body of knowledge unit­ing but transcending principles located in literature, the graphic arts and music, its influence including harmonizing the divisions of social order. Part of its spell is its claim to function as an imaginative model of the dynamic by which these spheres, indeed, the natural world, are held to­gether: "The aesthetic, one might argue, is in this sense the very para­digm of the ideological."' In Fanon's calculation, the aesthetic functions like internalized psychic policemen operating throughout the body poli­tic, maintaining the society's symbolic order:¶ In capitalist societies, the educational system, whether lay or clerical, the structure of moral reflexes handed down from father to son, the ex­emplary honesty of workers who are given a medal after fifty years of good and loyal service, and the affection which springs from harmoni­ous relations and good behavior—all these aesthetic expressions of re‑spect for the established order serve to create around the exploited per­son an atmosphere of submission and of inhibition which lightens the task of policing considerably.3°¶ The premises of the aesthetic raise it above ideology. Among these premises are the assertions that the work of art is autonomous and auto­telic on the one hand and universal, transcending geography and history on the other. One of the more ambitious recent efforts to support the uni­versality of aesthetic consciousness is White anthropologist Jacques Maquet's The Aesthetic Experience.' Much of his argument is based on a search for the purely ornamental in the artifacts of a wide range of the world's cultures. His argument is that the ornamental dimension of such work expresses its autotelism, its existence for its own sake, outside of function. But his illustrations range from instances in the West where the work for its own sake has achieved great respect in some social contexts to artifacts from cultures where the ornamentation of objects may be epi­phenomena of entirely different values. The demonstration of the wide­spread appeal of ornamentation makes a thin support for the universal presence of "the aesthetic experience" as defined in the West.¶ The point is that if the appropriate definitions were expanded to a neat capsule of aesthetic discourse, many of their elements would be found in societies around the world, but in very few societies outside the West would they be synthesized as a category of knowledge. Just as they did not appear in Europe in that form until the eighteenth century. The aes­thetic, then, is an ethnic gaze, and a class-bounded one at that. It operates in that region where the beliefs of its converts grant it an undeniable re­ality as a mental object. It is only when that provisional reality is exceeded and the aesthetic is underwritten as a universal category that it becomes identifiable as false consciousness, on a staggering scale. The fragility of its universalist claims, however, undermines its authority and weakens the whole of its discursive reach. If its face-value definition in dictionar­ies were replaced by a more practical one, such as "the taste and appre­ciative conventions of the Western ruling and bourgeois classes," we could begin to see how deeply its history has strained under false illusions.¶ This study will resist the weak temptation to refute the philosophical validity of aesthetic discourse at length. A much briefer and even sum­mary discussion seems adequate to establish its dishonesty in the terms of the politics of representation. Of course, the discipline of aesthetic rea­soning would have it otherwise, would insist on an entry into the Su­maoro's chamber of finely spun, devious, casuistic argument recalling the vacuous medieval reasoning that has characterized its discussionfrom the beginning.' And once one enters into this chamber, arguing the issue on its ground, an honorable exit is unlikely, without great loss of time and energy. (From experience, I have found defenders of aesthetic knowledge unable or unwilling to grant any presuppositions except that such a mental category exists in all of us, thereby making all argument circular and pointless—it exists because it is there.) But in fairness to those who cannot proceed without such confirmation of their doubts, we might pause to consider two cogent recitations of aesthetic logic.¶ The first is from White philosopher George Dickie (of the United States), who considers the much reputed "aesthetic attitude" or aesthetic gaze. This gaze is crucial to the "aesthetic experience" and different from other ways of knowing. In aesthetic theory, the special mode of being of the work of art demands a disinterestedness, an "aesthetic distance." The condition of art can theoretically only be approached and appreciated through this mode of mental cognition in order for its character as art, as opposed to everyday life and artifact, to stand forth. Dickie's close analy­sis, however, determines that no such unique mode of appreciation or rec­ognition can be isolated. He concludes, "But the aesthetic attitude ('the hallmark of modern aesthetics') in this formulation is a great letdown—it no longer seems to say anything significant. Nevertheless, this does seem to be all that is left after the aesthetic attitude has been purged of distancing and disinterestedness. The only thing which prevents the aes­thetic attitude from collapsing into simple attention is the qualification closely."'¶ Tony Bennett's critique begins with an acknowledgment of the general existence of "discourses of value" (which I have called "hierarchies of value"). These discourses of value make sense only with an ideal valu­ing subject in mind, someone capable of responding adequately to the prompt of experience, and of being a good citizen in the "valuing com­munity" where such values are legislated and shared. Such discourse for knowing thus depends on "the individual's valuation of self as both sub­ject of discernment and ultimate valued object. Their structure is thus narcissistic."' This seems to be a normative condition of human behav­ior, though one that can place severe limits on the human capacity to un­derstand and cope with difference. But these hazards are compounded by aestheticism, specifically by its reach toward hegemony and its claims to universal validity.¶ For aesthetic reasoning to go forward it must rely upon a "universal valuing subject" (or privileged collective consciousness) much more com­manding and absorptive than the "particular valuing communities" that¶ are to be found everywhere. This universal valuing subject relies on an "already elaborated theory of knowledge." Given what has been said, it is not merely unlikely but impossible for this universal valuing subject of aesthetic discourse to reflect any origin but its own, namely Western, ruling-class ideology. Bennett's analysis revolves around the crucial point of the receptor of "aesthetic" information, the subject located in the subject-position from which judgments of taste are confirmed or rejected. His critique assures that once again, the logical process is circular: the object is beautiful because I think it is beautiful. He quotes White Scot­tish philosopher David Hume: "Thus, though the principles of taste be universal, and nearly the same in all men; yet few are qualified to give judgment on any work of art, or establish their own sentiment as the standard of beauty. .. . some men in general, however difficult to be par­ticularly pitched upon, will be acknowledged by universal sentiment to have a preference over others."' Hume will give us clear indication in a footnote of this work of some who must be excluded from the considera­tions of taste, or even civilization. Kant's much subtler analysis affirms the necessarily subjective condition of aesthetic reasoning, as well as re­lying on a universal valuing subject, but fudges the difficult question of relativity of judgment by positing an ultimately true judgment of taste in posterity. In other words, the most refined elaboration of aesthetic theory ends by asserting that there ought to be final unanimity on the questions of beauty and taste, some day in the future.¶ It is worth recalling Bennett's conclusion at length:¶ Notwithstanding the scientific claims which often accompany it, aes­thetic discourse is ideological in the Althusserian sense that it functions as a discourse producing subjects. The universal valuing subject (man) it constructs interpellates the reader into the position of a valuing subject who is defined, in relation to the valued object (man), within a mirror structure of self-recognition. Yes, indeed, man is manifested in this ob­ject; yes, indeed, I recognize myself in it; isn't it/aren't I wonderful?—such is the effect of aesthetic discourse for the subject who takes up the position it offers. As ideology, however, aesthetic discourse is character­ized by a number of contradictions and torsions, albeit ones which vary in their consequences depending on the political articulations of such discourse. In the case of bourgeois aesthetics, the production of a unified valuing subject, although necessary in providing a theoretical legitima­tion for the representation of class-specific aesthetic norms as univer­sally valid, is also at another level, a sham, and necessarily so.¶ ¶ As with both of these critiques, the validity of the aesthetic as a cate­gory of knowledge rests largely on the issue of universality. But the uni‑versality of the category carries different meanings. The category can be thought of as responding to a science of the beautiful whose rules are universally valid, regardless of regional variations: one aesthetic law for everybody. Or, the aesthetic can indicate a category found explicitly in many civilized societies and implicitly in less civilized societies, or even in all societies, but a category whose content varies with the cultural con­texts in which it is exercised: we all have an aesthetic, but my aesthetic may be different than yours.¶ You don't have to be clairvoyant to guess which of these versions of universality arose first. The historical shift from one idea of universality to another is revealing. One aesthetic for all is the legacy of ethnocentric Euro-enlightenment. The first aesthetic philosophers considered them­selves as uncovering a category of "Universal Reason," and anyone who differed from their opinions was merely exposing his or her backward­ness. But even in this period, there were occasional and routine demur­rers, raising the possibility of some relativity among nations and peoples when it came to perceiving the beautiful. Museology may have been re­sponsible for the extension of aesthetic criteria to other societies whose arts and artifacts acquired vogues among Western consumers, i.e., Japa­nese scrolls, Chinese vases, Persian carpets, as well as greater knowledge of the architecture and other cultural forms of non-Western societies past and present. Then, the dogmas of taste became a criterion for the civi­lized. It has only been under the impetus of decolonization theory, re­flected in comparative anthropology, that the aesthetic sense has been at­tributed to all societies.¶ The absurdity of one aesthetic of universal application for all cultures is transparent, though doubtless some philosophers and psychologists continue the search, despite its diminishing returns. In the place of this universal dogma, many are drawn to a multicultural notion of plural aes­thetics. Yet the fallacy of this more modern, supposedly democratic mul­ticultural notion of the aesthetic is epistemological. It needs to be re­peated that the distribution of categories of knowledge among different cultures shows no pattern where they overlap around one category de­voted to aesthetic knowledge. Instead, evidence shows that protocols of beauty are integrated within other categories in different societies and often are not isolated in any fashion resembling what Western knowledge has defined as the aesthetic. Notoriously, many languages have no word for art, just as no society in the world had a word for aesthetics until 1735. Where anthropologists have ferreted out such hierarchies, they haveseldom shown them as they exist in the raw, i.e., integrated within their home cosmologies. The discovery of such "aesthetic systems" is much like the discovery of the Americas, bearing all the marks of the precon­ceptions and interests of the discoverers. They find aesthetic systems the way Columbus found "the Indies" in the Caribbean. Aesthetic universal­ity is bourgeois cognition caught in a permanent "mirror phase." The question becomes, can such investigators who have invented a scheme of knowledge for their own self-fashioning locate the same kind of knowl­edge among foreign cultures without appending the biases of their self-fashioning, and if they could remove their "idols of the tribe," why would they not remove the category altogether, since the category is itself largely a repository of mental idolatry? In other words, only an investigator who had no preconceptions about the existence of the aesthetic as a category of knowledge could objectively locate one in a remote culture. Even more unlikely, though technically possible, would be for Western scholars, busy establishing the order of things in the ioos, to discover a principle in a non-Western society and make that foreign principle the basis for a category of "Universal Reason" or a discipline of study.¶ The quest for the universality of the aesthetic mistakes the existence of hierarchies of values in all cultures around objects, performances, or events as evidence of "aesthetic" calculation. But value hierarchies oper­ate within cultural cosmologies and ideological configurations. Two so­cieties often venerate the same object, but for entirely different reasons, as we are reminded when a museum piece is reclaimed by its originating cultural community for its ritual or other value. Or the intensity of ven­eration in two societies may appear similar but be very differently moti­vated.¶ The world's diverse cultural hierarchies have been shanghaied into service of aesthetic theory in two ways. Non-Western value systems are sampled to disguise the isolation of the aesthetic as a local, Western mid­dle-class preoccupation. But under the assumption that the aesthetic is a Western philosophical discovery (of universal import), and most highly developed in its articulation and intellectual finesse in the West, aesthetic theory is simultaneously used to establish the relative inferiority of these non-Western societies in this area of development, and by inference, gen­erally.¶ Maquet's inquiry is part of a very recent anthropological effort, re­searching oral cultures to discover the nature of their "aesthetics." This research responds to a liberal ideological motive, to reverse the use of aes‑¶ thetic criteria for inferiorization, and instead to use it to help establish the common humanity of all peoples. Not surprising, investigators have unearthed the criteria for stratified valuation of different objects. This is unremarkable, since very little human activity is undertaken without ideas for gauging anticipated success. Researches like this also have a double function. The "discovery" of scales of respect for different objects or experiences elevates that society in the ranks of civilization, in the lib­eral ethnographer's eyes. At the same time, the "discovery" tacitly con­firms the universality of a specifically Western perspective. But this lib­eral gesture effects a "one way universality," as noted by two interrogators of the complex idea of the "primitive."' If ethnographers have only re­cently begun to inquire into the criteria of beauty and desirability among non-Western peoples, neither they nor other aestheticians have hardly ever inquired about response by "primitives" to objects from outside these cultures, like the Mona Lisa, for instance.'</p><p>The best form of resistance to the status quo’s aesthetic narrative of beauty and perfection is a complete embrace of imperfection.

Beneath that question lies another: who are the "we" that is mounting this resistance and how do "we" conceive ourselves? Though very different, even dia­metrical alternatives, the two perspectives are alike in limiting them­selves within a low-productive culturalism. The weakness of culturalism as defined here lies in buying into notions of culture organized by the canonical art-culture system, partly as articulated by Matthew Arnold and partly by classical anthropology. This is a view of culture divorced from history (except a kind of museum catalog, cultural history), and therefore from political analysis.¶ The limitation of these two culturalist perspectives are overcome in the theoretical insights of Julio Garcia Espinosa's essay "For an Imperfect Cinema."' Writing as a Cuban filmmaker and theorist, Espinosa fash­ioned an argument usually considered a part of third cinema theory, and as such, remains one of its most endurable products. If dominant cinema has managed to present itself as "perfect cinema—technically and artis­tically masterful," then there is no better choice for the resistant film ac­tivist than to cultivate an "imperfect cinema."5¶ Espinosa's case for a new concept of cinema rests on an anti-elitist cri­tique of "art." Art as an isolated, impartial, uncommitted activity, as pro­duced by individuals regarded as special and different, as an activity car­rying its own, peculiar cognitive agency, is recognized by Espinosa as an irrelevance: "A new poetics of the cinema will, above all, be a 'partisan' and 'committed', art, a consciously and resolutely 'committed' cinema—that is to say, an 'imperfect' cinema."' Instead of the "perfection" claimed by high art, Espinosa advances popular art, by which he means cultural work practiced as a general, social activity, in which the collaboration be­tween the work and the receiving audience/population is foregrounded.¶ For critiques of aestheticism, the example of jazz quickly rises as an example of cultural production amazingly vital and yet amazingly free of the rules and regularities of classicism. Not surprisingly, then, in an argument somewhat parallel to Espinosa's, one writer, Ted Gioia, dis­cusses jazz as The Imperfect Art: True, jazz embodies many of the features that mark the concept of Espinosa's imperfect cinema, its call-response relation to its audience, its commitment to improvisation and process rather than to calculation and product, its collective authorship, its irrev­erence toward tradition, its unabashed populism. Gioia senses the revo­lutionary potential in this configuration: "An aesthetics of jazz would al­most be a type of non-aesthetics."' If Gioia inches back from the precipice of this discovery, retreating into bromides about the creative artist in an attempt to win a place for jazz musicians in this lineage, we need not follow him in these regressions.¶ In both these descriptions "imperfect" must be understood as ironi­cal, that is, as depending on a double meaning, twinned with the concept of the perfect that those with the privileges of power/knowledge are eager to impose. The concept of "imperfect" culture acknowledges this power to define at the same time that it rejects the substance of the defini­tions. It exposes the irony that resistance will always embrace contraband meanings and values, and these meanings and their carriers will always be framed as unofficial, unorthodox, indiscrete, undisciplined, chaotic, methodologically incorrect, vulgar, or in a word, imperfect. Speaking in an entirely different context, Fanon glimpsed the imperfection of the colonized populations: "In the Weltanschauung of a colonized people there is an impurity, a flaw that outlaws any ontological explanation."' This is the Fanon that sees the condition of the colonized as a pathology, not the later Fanon that sees it as a moment pregnant with change and transformation. In other words, Fallon and Gioia recognize the impurity of uncanonized people and their thought and culture, but with less of the irony that Espinosa brings to the models against which they are inevita­bly deemed lacking. The shallowness of "perfection" is perhaps more quickly grasped in Espinosa's example of the cinema of perfection, the slick, technically poised practice of the culture industry.' It is the per­fection of an aestheticized cultural regime, of the Crystal Palace, and by isolating it from other possibilities Espinosa refreshes our eyes to the or­dinary.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><h1 id="H1AC2013Kentucky" class="western wikigeneratedheader"><span>1AC – Kentucky</span></h1><p> <br/>Contention One is Nature<br/>Aesthetic evaluations are required now in considering changes to the environment or landscape – it doesn’t matter what the benefits of the project may be, the government has absolute discretion to reject “eyesores” – this is in the context of energy developments<br/>Walworth ‘6, “Case Note: Regulating Aesthetics of Coastal Maine: Kroeger v.
