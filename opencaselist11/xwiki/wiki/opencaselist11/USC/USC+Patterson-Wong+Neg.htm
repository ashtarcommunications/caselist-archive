The attempt to escape all norms doesn’t teach us about what is inevitable in life. &nbsp;Things like the law, structure, and norms are inevitable and we need to learn how to exist within this world. &nbsp;Their arguments are a fantasy of a life that can never exist.<br/>HATAB, Prof of Philosophy @ Old Dominion University, 02<br/>(Lawrence J., The Journal of Nietzsche Studies 24 (2002) 132-147)<br/>Modern societies, at least, cannot function without institutions and the coercive force of law…that refashions natural energies in less savage and more productive directions.</p><p>Liberating the oppressed is co-opted, used for more domination<br/>SARAH Hendricks, who works for the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, WROTE IN 98 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../fcis.oise.utoronto.ca/~daniel_schugurensky/freire/sh2.html)" tppabs="http://fcis.oise.utoronto.ca/~daniel_schugurensky/freire/sh2.html)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://fcis.oise.utoronto.ca/~daniel_schugurensky/freire/sh2.html)</span></a></span><br/>Freire's generalized and homogenized conception of oppression… the methodology of Freire's pedagogy could easily be co-opted and utilized to perpetuate systems of domination.</p><p>Calling for authentic migration experience is a strategy ripe for co-option. The state loves the supposedly authentic spokespersons of migration as tokens to pretend as if it’s benevolent.<br/>Lentin, senior lecturer in Sociology, director of the MPhil in Ethnic and Racial Studies, and founder member of the Trinity Immigration Initiative, 08 (Ronit, Migrant women’s networking: New articulations of transnational ethnicity)<br/>I want to conclude by asking whether co opting representatives of migrant networks…and the recognition of ethnoracially &nbsp;heterogeneous states.</p><p>IT IS DISCONCERTING THAT SOME INDIVIDUALS MERELY STAND WITH THE DISPOSSESSED. &nbsp;DO WE REALLY BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE SUFFERING WANT US TO JUST OBSERVE THEIR SUFFERING? &nbsp;OR DO THEY WANT US TO STRIVE TOWARDS ACTUALIZING THEIR CONCERNS?&nbsp;</p><p>THE QUESTION WE SHOULD BE ASKING OUR SELVES IS “HOW CAN CONCERN BE SUSTAINED, ACTUALIZED, AND CONTINUED?” &nbsp;ANYTHING LESS IS BETRAYAL.<br/>Raskin 99, PROF OF PUBLIC POLICY, (Marcus, G Wash U, Transnational Law &amp; Contemporary Problems, Fall)<br/>For those who were consigned to the role of slave… This failure, this sense of futility where knowledge is an instrument of domination for the few, demands recognition.&nbsp;</p><h3 id="HBlockCards"><span>Block Cards</span></h3><p>YOU INVERT THE HIEARCHY. &nbsp;&nbsp;EVEN FREIRE VOTES NEG. &nbsp;<br/>Adeleke, Pf African American Studies, The University of Montana-Missoula, 02<br/>(Tunde, Globalization And the Challenges of Race-based Pedagogy, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../globalization.icaap.org/content/v2.2/adeleke.html)" tppabs="http://globalization.icaap.org/content/v2.2/adeleke.html)"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://globalization.icaap.org/content/v2.2/adeleke.html)</span></a></span><br/>The need for a distinct black pedagogy and epistemology seems justifiable within American society and polity… is often a narrow and poor replica of the original.</p><div class="wikimodel-emptyline"></div><p>JUST BECAUSE YOU MAKE THE DEBATE COMMUNITY MORE AWARE OF ITS RACISM DOESN’T MEAN IT’LL CHANGE<br/>Litowitz, Assistant Professor, Chicago-Kent College of Law. B.A., Oberlin College, 97 (Douglas E. University of Notre Dame, 72 Notre Dame L. Rev. 503)<br/>But there is a problematic assumption running through much CRT scholarship…(black, white, Asian), because we are splintered enough as it is.<br/>Politicizing sex only fuels the religious right <br/>Diana DeGette 9, Vice Chair of the Committee on Energy and Commerce and co-chair of the Congressional Pro-Choice Caucus, “The Politicization of Sex and Reproduction”, <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../www.huffingtonpost.com/rep-diana-degette/the-politicization-of-sex_b_163847.html" tppabs="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rep-diana-degette/the-politicization-of-sex_b_163847.html"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rep-diana-degette/the-politicization-of-sex_b_163847.html</span></a></span> <br/>Right-wing Republicans continually use sex as a weapon when they don't have an effective argument to stand on … all with one aim in mind: to advance their political agenda over common-sense public health policies.<br/>The right specializes in coopting movements like yours—they’ll use it to crush public eroticism <br/>Dagmar Herzog professor of history at the Graduate Center, City University of New York. She has published extensively on the historiesof sexuality and gender, theology and religion “Sex in Crisis: How the Religious Right Is Trying to Ruin Sex for Everyone”, &nbsp;8 <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="wikimodel-freestanding" href="../../../../../www.alternet.org/sex/93519/sex_in_crisis-_how_the_religious_right_is_trying_to_ruin_sex_for_everyone/index.htm" tppabs="http://www.alternet.org/sex/93519/sex_in_crisis:_how_the_religious_right_is_trying_to_ruin_sex_for_everyone/"><span class="wikigeneratedlinkcontent">http://www.alternet.org/sex/93519/sex_in_crisis:_how_the_religious_right_is_trying_to_ruin_sex_for_everyone/</span></a></span> <br/>The Religious Right is a capacious tent in which many agendas and approaches have found a home. … and the assault on abortion felt like it could grow into an assault on whatever else anyone might want to do with their lives and bodies as well.</p>
