# Archived Caselists

These are archives of caselists prior to the advent of openCaselist.

## NDT-CEDA

These originally used a numbering scheme on wikispaces where the year in the wiki name is the year of that season's NDT. They have been normalized to match the openCaselist convention of naming each caselist after the start of the season.

From 2006-2007 through 2008-2009, the same wikispaces wiki was used, so there are duplicates pages from the wrong years included in the directories. I have made some effort to parcel these out to the correct years, but it's not complete.
