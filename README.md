# Archived Caselists
Prior to the advent of openCaselist, disclosure information for both NDT-CEDA college debate and NDCA HS debate was posted on a variety of different platforms, including different wikispaces.com wikis, an earlier XWiki version of openCaselist, and for some years just in large Word documents emailed between teams.

This repo contains archives of some of these sources, and links to other sites which maintain archives. It is by no means complete. If you would like to contribute to the project by adding more archives (such as creating an offline archive from one of the archive.org links below), please feel free to submit a pull request.

Theoretically, it would be possible to scrape these sources, clean up the data, and import them into openCaselist. I'm unlikely to tackle that project personally, but if anyone else is interested, I'd be happy to offer suggestions on where to start.

In particular, scraping archive.org snapshots is difficult, as it has significant rate limits, the wiki structure has a lot of links that result in duplicate content, and there are nested pages, wikis with overlapping years, etc.

## NDT-CEDA (College)
NDT-CEDA moved to openCaselist for the 2011-2012 season. The first three years are archived here as separate static sites (`opencaselist11`, `opencaselist12`, and `opencaselist13`). Starting with 2014-2015, all content has been migrated into the current openCaselist site.

Caselists from 1999-2000 through 2010-2011 are in the `ndtceda` directory. These originally used a numbering scheme on wikispaces where the year in the wiki name is the year of that season's NDT. They have been normalized to match the openCaselist convention of naming each caselist after the start of the season.

For 2006-2007, 2007-2008, and 2008-2009, the same wikispaces wiki was used, so there are duplicates pages from the wrong years included in the directories. I have made some effort to parcel these out to the correct years, but it's not complete.

## NDCA (High School)
NDCA Policy and LD caselists moved to openCaselist for the 2013-2014 season. The first year of both are included here as static sites (`hspolicy13`, `hsld13`). Starting with 2014-2015, all content has been migrated into the current openCaselist site.

HS caselists from 2007-2008 through 2012-2013 were hosted on various wikispaces sites. An archive of one site used for 2010-2011, 2011-2012, and 2012-2013 is included in the `ndca` directory. Other years are hosted on archive.org and linked below. If anyone would like to put in the work to scrape archive.org and include those archives here, feel free to submit a pull request.

### Open Evidence Project
The Open Evidence Project moved to openCaselist for the 2013-2014 season. There are some archives from before then, but they do not appear to be available from the NDCA website anymore. Archive.org has some snapshots, but they may not be complete/usable.
