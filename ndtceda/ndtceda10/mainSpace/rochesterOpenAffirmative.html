 “We have a very, very serious problems in this community. Back in 1960, when I was a young cop on the beat, we put the mentally ill people who were threats into a system that incarcerated them. Today, they’re out on the street, and we’re paying a price for it.” <br />
<br />
- Clarence Wiiliam Dupnik, Sherrif of Pima County, Arizona, in response to the Giffords shootings. <br />
<br />
On January 8th a shooting occurred in Tuscon that produced a national debate on American public discourse. Arizona is a key site in the immigration debate – the discursive environment was ripe with hatred towards illegal immigrants and anti-government rhetoric. Almost immediately, a number of discourses and narratives competed to define the historical event, from calls to decrease violent political rhetoric and increase gun control to political scapegoating. But just as quickly, we saw the emergence of a familiar narrative of ideology and state power that re-directed the focus of the discussion. Instead of critical reflection the dominant narrative asserted that the Tuscon shooting was an isolated incident composed in the deranged mind of an uncontrollably mentally ill individual….there is no societal narrative and no reason to contest power or discourse. Instead the call is for more state authority, more centralized power, more surveillance, more disciplinary power and more involuntary commitment. The New Republic embodied this narrative when it called for legal changes in the wake of the shooting.  <br />
The periodical The New Republic embodied this by calling for involuntary commitment, constant surveillance, and a drive to destroy the other when they wrote on January 11th that  <br />

The bottom line: No one was legally  <br />

<br />
But how does this relate to the resolution? Aside from the obvious linkage between what have now become the two hot-button issues of Arizonan politics – immigration politics and the direction of the mental health narrative post-shooting – Current US Visa Policy contains the same categorizations of what constitutes mental fitness that fuels the social antagonism inherent to the type of narrative that would involuntarily incarcerate some and call for the rest to violently police one another with the goal of preventing the mentally ill from infilitrating and infecting our society.  <br />

The stigmatization mental health carries creates incalculable suffering. The mentally ill are treated as if they have no agency and their subjectivity is corrupted. Exclusions and categorizations produce subjects that are silenced as irrational and depoliticized – they are seen as disposable at best and a threat at worst. Mental health categories and labeling are part of a process whereby an expert gets to determine your subjectivity, and impose an alternate narrative onto which you may not object. This is the classic example of a sovereign authority creating knowledge under the guise of specialized objectivity. The story in Tuscon becomes only a story of someone gone crazy – nothing else to see unless you are a psychiatrist – and the key political question becomes how can we better control the dangerously mentally ill, foreclosing the possibility to interrogate how is it that our endorsements of biopolitical control contribute to systemic exclusions that produce outbursts of violence. It has become an empty receptacle that power can use whenever challenges to authority occur. Resistance to capitalism? Resistance to US authority? Only for the irrational. Only for the insane.  <br />

Thus we advocate – the resolution provides us an opportunity to perform a critique of knowledge production as it relates to the intersection of immigration and mental health politics. We recognize that every action we take invokes forms of power for legitimation and implementation. Thus we posit the role of the debaters and judges as the ethical agents of power and their decision should reflect the most productive usage of the disciplinary technology of the ballot. We occupy a space within an activity that is founded on knowledge production and technologies of education – it is in this case that we must remain mindful of the ways we direct power and should use the inevitable power of this debate round and its knowledge production to affirm a criticism of US visa policy and the categorizations it fosters.  <br />

<h1 id="toc8"><a name="Mental Health Aff (Narrative Version)"></a>Mental Health Aff (Narrative Version)</h1>
 <a name="_GoBack"></a>On January 8th a shooting occurred in Tuscon that produced a national debate on American public discourse. Arizona is a key site in the immigration debate – the discursive environment was ripe with hatred towards illegal immigrants and anti-government rhetoric. Sherrif Dupnik in response to the initial attack “The anger, the hatred, the bigotry…Arizona I think has become sort of the capital. We have become the mecca for prejudice and bigotry.” The tragedy produced a ripple in the discursive and political conscious of the country. We immediately began a critical reflection upon the discourses we produce the way violence in our speech act can create violence in our politics and induce material suffering. An opportunity was opened to re-orient criticism back onto the constant state of violence and securitization that plagues public discourse in our country. <br />
Almost immediately a number of political discourses attempted to fill the opening – ranging from calls to end the violent political imagery to demands for increased gun control. These competing narratives shape the meaning of the event and the histories it produces by structuring the meta-narrative of the event. The event has become a site of knowledge production – with each shaping of knowledge competing for dominance to shape the history of the Giffords shooting. The Giffords tragedy offers us the opportunity to glimpse how power operates to subvert narratives that challenge authority and instead diffuses resistance into realms that obscure the operation of power. With a sleight of hand the discussion is reoriented from liberal or progressive calls to a fundamentally conservative one. <br />
9/11 provides an example – an opportunity for critical reflection on the process of globalization and the way US hegemony and intervention in the Middle East had produced animosity and antagonism was bypassed for a retreat back into an ideology. Power shaped the knowledge and history of the event producing identities and subjects. Terrorists were crazy fundamentalists who hated our freedom. This knowledge meant only violent solutions were available and directed our policy choices in favor of a narrative that reinforced US hegemonic forces and biopolitical control. Today we are seeing a similar reshaping of a narrative to produce a similar retreat into ideology and power via the production of knowledge with the solutions limited to discipline and punishment. <br />
<br />
The Giffords shooting has produced another set of narratives that seek to deflect criticism from violence and political justice towards calls for 60’s styles reincarceration of the mentally ill. One of the first instances of this narrative was produced by Sheriff Clarence Dupnik when he claimed, “We have very, very serious problems in this community. Back in 1960, when I was a young cop on the beat, we put the mentally ill people who were threats into a system that incarcerated them. Today, they’re out on the street, and we’re paying a price for it.” (Democracy Now, CNN). <br />
<br />
This narrative has spread to the front-pages of the New York Times and begun to dominate media coverage of the Tuscon shooting. Instead of critical reflection the dominant narrative claims that the Tuscon shooting was an isolated incident composed in the deranged mind of an uncontrollably mentally ill individual. There is no societal narrative, no reason to contest power or discourse, in fact the only thing that is necessary is more biopolitical control of a population far on the periphery of society. Instead of challenges to state authority and rhetoric we get calls for more centralization, more involuntary commitment, more discipline, more punishment. The New Republic exemplifies this trend when they called for involuntary commitment, constant surveillance and a drive to search and destroy the other. They wrote on January 11, 2011, <br />
<br />
The New Republic, William Galston, 01/11/11, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.tnr.com/blog/william-galston/81228/the-tucson-shooter-and-the-case-involuntary" rel="nofollow">http://www.tnr.com/blog/william-galston/81228/the-tucson-shooter-and-the-case-involuntary</a> commitment?utm_source =Editors+and+Bloggers&amp;utm_campaign=864e9a4638-Edit_and_Blogs&amp;utm_medium=email <br />
<br />
The bottom line: No one was legally <br />
AND <br />
our community and the functioning of our democracy? <br />
<br />
The direction of this narrative is one that tends towards control and otherization. The mentally ill are unreasonable and irrational – the only sure thing is that they will commit violence -- The stigma that those who are mentally ill experience is reinforced by the strategy of otherization – the categorization of the mentally ill is at the root of what makes stories like Loughners prevalent in American history. Instead of retreating into ideology we should use this moment to rethink the way we approach questions of mental health. Now is THE KEY discursive moment. Benjamin Kerstein had the following narrative to relay. (OPTIONAL) <br />

When I was twenty years old, I <br />
AND <br />
good life, and even a happy one. <br />
<br />
The strategy is clear – obscure the operation of power by using mental illness as an empty signifier used to encompass large segments of white violence – it is a rhetorical strategy that produces a different narrative that avoids challenging authority. It allows double standards to operate and knowledge to be produced based on race. (OPTIONAL) <br />
<br />
Dean Obeidallah, 01/13/11, What if Jared Loughner were a Muslim?, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://edition.cnn.com/2011/OPINION/01/13/obeidallah.loughner.muslims/" rel="nofollow">http://edition.cnn.com/2011/OPINION/01/13/obeidallah.loughner.muslims/</a> <br />
<br />
But let's be brutally honest. If the <br />
AND <br />
the same goes for a non-Muslim. <br />
How does this relate to the resolution? Beyond the obvious linkage of the mainstays of Arizona politics – immigration politics and the mental health narrative of the shootings – there is a far more insidious relationship that becomes apparent. Current US Visa policy contains the same categorizations of mental health and unhealth that produce the narrative that the excess social antagonism is being deposited into now. Mental illness has become a lens that obscures the functioning of power– the same fear of the violent and dangerous mentally ill and ultimately the same strategies of exclusion and stigmatization that seek to secure the population from the diseased other are being produced in US immigration policy. The goal is to avoid the mentally ill from interacting and infecting our population – rather we endorse the drive to purify our population and exclude those that might contaminate our community. The goal is biopolitical exclusion – the visa system treats all mentally ill as dangerous and thus excludable. <br />
The biopolitical shaping of both the narrative of Tuscon and the experience of those described by US visa policy are the same. Exclusions and categorizations produce subjects – they identify an entire segment of the population and produce knowledge about the essential identity of that population. Subjects are silenced as irrational and depoliticized – they are seen as disposable at best and a threat at worst. Mental health categories and labeling are part of a process whereby an expert gets to determine your subjectivity for you, then silence your narrative and impose an alternate narrative and then finally speak on your behalf. This is the classic example of a sovereign authority creating knowledge under the guise of specialized objectivity. The story in Tuscon is only a story of someone gone crazy – nothing else to see unless you are a psychiatrist – the key political question posed by Tuscon is how can we better control the dangerously mentally ill – not how is it that our endorsements of biopolitical control contribute to systemic exclusions that produce outbursts of violence. It has become an empty receptacle that power can use whenever challenges to authority occur. Resistance to capitalism? – only crazy people think about that – resistance to US authority? – only crazy terrorists. <br />

The plan displays that our methodology can make conclusions that are topical and political BUT we simultaneously recognize that we cannot enact the plan. The ballot represents an endorsement of a particular knowledge production in our case – a challenging to the biopolitical order and the discourses that sustain it. Attempts to sever affirmatives from the forms of knowledge they produce are artificial and unpredictable which outweighs any potential ground loss. <br />
