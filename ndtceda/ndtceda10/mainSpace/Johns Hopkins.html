 <br />
<br />
There is a clash of civilizations, where<br />
Fighting happens along the border between policy and performance,<br />
Black world and white world..<br />
Worlds we once called home,<br />
but were violently excluded from.<br />
<br />
In debate, we are migrants seeking a home,<br />
Seeking home in a community at war,<br />
Seeking home in a community that demands for us to choose,<br />
But as migrants we refuse to choose,<br />
For, both sides have attacked us, ripping the soul from our argument::<br />
<br />
Two stacked tubs on a table,<br />
Debaters dressed in military garb spewing out answers to Towson,<br />
The timer alarm rings off and it is time for cross-x,<br />
I ask him simply,<br />
“Why answer us like towson?”<br />
He responds,<br />
“You and towson are basically the same.”<br />
I ask, “howso?”<br />
He responds,<br />
“I don’t know, you both hate debate.”<br />
My argument has been thrown back at me distorted and simplified,<br />
transformed from critical love to simple hate speech,<br />
made into a straw-man zombie argument, walking dead,<br />
with no soul.<br />
<br />
A different round, now in New York,<br />
Our opponent sits in a chair next to the judge,<br />
Spewing out answers to pascifism,<br />
Criticizing Dr. King for not being as black as Malcolm,<br />
Then starts to criticize my partner for going to Johns Hopkins,<br />
Challenging his blackness and my blackness,<br />
Says we are not radical enough, laughs at our efforts to create dialogue,<br />
Says the community is at war and that love is a joke,<br />
and we’re not black enough to fight for change.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
We are not black enough, not white enough,<br />
We don’t defend policy, but we’re still not radical enough.<br />
We are refugees in this community,<br />
forced to migrate because war tore us from our homes.<br />
<br />
In this community, we are migrants seeking a home,<br />
Seeking home in a community at war,<br />
Seeking home in a community that demands for us to choose,<br />
But as migrants we refuse to choose,<br />
For we have built our home at the border,<br />
Where your violent gazes can no longer rip our souls from our bodies.<br />
<br />
<strong>The same way debaters establish and maintain their power over identities through violent</strong><br />
<strong>otherization, the entire nation-state system was built on the same logic. The identity of the nation is constructed through the creation and maintenance of the border</strong>.<br />

<br />
<strong>This type of death occurs in what we will call the spirit or the soul. Every being has a soul within them that animates them and also extends past them, connecting them to others, to their past, and to their future.</strong><br />

<strong>The creation of bordered identities murders our souls. In debate we mostly speak about physical demise, but that kind of death is not experiencable. Soul death is something one experiences consistently as a painful internal crisis that creates suicidal drives. Steven Crowell explains the differences between physical demise and soul death when he writes,</strong><br />
[Steven Crowell, 2004 “Authentic Historicality”, Space, Time, and Culture, pg. 65-66]<br />
<br />
<strong>Soul Death is not simply an individual phenomemon, but is something that we experience collectively because of the system of hierarchized identities we live in. Dr. Martin Luther King jr speaks on the collectivity of soul death when he said,</strong><br />
[Martin Luther King, 1964 “Noble Lecture”]<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>This national poverty of spirit creates an internal insecurity at the community, national, and international level, which calls for destroying difference in order to make the national community coherent and meaningful. Talking about the phenomenon of soul death in a different way, Jutta Weldes writes,</strong><br />
<strong>[Jutta Weldes, Mark Laffey, Hugh Gusterson, Raymond Duvall. “Introduction: Constructing Insecurity”. 1999 pg.11-12]</strong><br />

<strong>Soul Death is not simply a “quality of life” argument, but is the root cause behind all forms of conflict and war. In order to heal the wounds of soul death, we must create a site for breaking down the border.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Therefore, our framework is the judge should vote for who best solves for soul death.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Our advocacy statement is the debate community should affirm the topic as a spiritual act against all borders that exist in our lives.</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Our advocacy to solve for soul death is to actively resist systems of bordered identities through affirming the topic spiritually. This affirmation recognizes the soul in all beings around us and the connectedness that the revelation of the soul reveals. We do not deny or desire to destroy difference, but instead we orient the soul as the starting point for our activism against systems of domination. This orientation allows us to build a new narrative where what connects us is more important than what divides us, allowing us to break down the borders that exist in our lives.</strong><br />

<strong>We understand that affirming a topic about visas to break down borders sound contradictory, but we affirm this contradiction. Bordered identities are built to create order and destroy contradictions, ambiguities, and difference. The only way to create a new consciousness and solve for soul death is to affirm the contradictions that do not fit in an ordered society. Affirming contradictions helps to bridge divisions and heals our souls in the process</strong><br />

<strong>Normally the ballot is a tool for voting for or against a policy. We rupture this interpretation by viewing the ballot as a bridge-building tool. Voting affirmative is an act of connection where the judge connects their decision to our advocacy, legitimizing the place of the spirit in debate. Tim Wise, a former policy debater, speaks to the power of the ballot in 2007.</strong><br />
[Tim Wise, 2007, White Like Me]<br />
<br />
<strong>The ballot is not for the creation of a movement to change debate, but instead creates a moment of rupture where change is birthed from the old through building bridges across the borders that normally separate us. The multiplication of these moments creates a movimiento, a collection of small acts that creates a quiet storm that changes debate, our nation, and our world from the inside out.</strong><br />
