 <br />
Our relation to the other is always already structured by the threat of loss that death represents- kinship is an attempt to foreclose that loss through historical continuity (genealogy), biological sameness (genetics), or even economic responsibility and legal contract (marriage/adoption), creating a symbolic substance that can persist against the threat of death and loss- this collapses difference and reduces the world to standing reserve, guarded forever against the possibility of mourning<br />

<strong><span class="underline"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The aff’s disavowal of death through kinship is the root cause of heterosexism- the threat of death is externalized through massive structural violence, rendering heterosexuals “relatively safe” from loss- this fantasy of immortality can only be sustained by continual production of others upon whom death can be displaced</span></span></strong><br />

You can’t win a link turn- even exploding the definition of the family doesn’t change the ontology of kinship- the visa system uses “family based visas” to establish a link of possession to those already within the United States that erases difference and ensures that our approach to the Other is rooted in violent disavowal of death<br />

<br />
<br />
Spectrality is a better starting point for politics- rather than seeking to create presence for queers, we should question whether heterosexuals were ever present to begin with- only beginning with a displacement of the presence/absence binary can create the conditions for a productive politics, all other approaches cede to the narcissism of equality on heterosexual terms<br />

Self-recognition DA- the permutation leads to mourning mediated by kinship practices- we mourn the loss of others in order to create the fantasy of our own self-presence- only a primordial concept of mourning can activate a notion of responsibility that doesn’t collapse into narcissism<br />

<br />
Disavowal of death ensures the aff is co-opted and replicates American exceptionalism- the national security state is constructed through a narrative of timelessness that seeks to place it beyond the end of history- the aff’s attempt to control and regulate death through kinship and queer presence reproduces the ontological conditions for existing fascist institutions, ensuring endless military violence and global despair<br />

Mourning precedes structural violence- focusing on the uneven allocation of death ignores the reality of death itself and attempts to eradicate loss- only beginning with being-toward-death can create effective politics<br />

Interpretation- the aff should read a topical plan and the neg should test the plan and/or it’s method of justification<br />

<br />
<u>We control uniqueness</u>- the question of justification is intrically bound up with the immigration debate- the only question is whether we will uncritically accept status quo knowledge production, or make it a <u>point of stasis</u><br />

<strong>If we win our FW args it means a couple of things- justifies role of the ballot</strong><br />
<strong>Our <u>role for the ballot</u> is that this debate should be a question of who produces the best concept of subjectivity- that means that you should evaluate our links as indications of the particular type of subjectivity that the aff engages in and our impacts as the logical consequences of that subjectivity</strong><br />
<strong><u>Plan is not offense</u>- questions like “does the alt bans H-1B visas” are irrelevant- our <u>point of stasis</u> is whether the subjectivity the aff creates in advocating visa expansion is good- if its bad then you reject the aff because the plan responds to a poorly constructed and dangerous model of the world</strong><br />
<strong><u>Reject plan minus justifications perms</u>- these perms sever the question of the aff’s method and link to our disads above- you should instead evaluate perms as a combination of the aff and alt methods</strong><br />
