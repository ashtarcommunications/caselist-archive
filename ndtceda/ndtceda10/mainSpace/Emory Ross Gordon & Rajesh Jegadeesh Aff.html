<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Although multinational corporations and free trade are proving good for development and human rights in the Third World, there still remains</span> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the objection that globalization harms the environment</span></u>. <span style="font-size: 6pt;">Factories in the Western world, the argument runs, will relocate to poorer countries with no environmental legislation, where they can pollute with impunity. The West has to follow suit and lower its own environmental standards in order to stay in business. That is a dismal thesis, with the implication that when people obtain better opportunities, resources, and technology, they use them to abuse nature. Does there really have to be a conflict between development and the environment?</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">The notion that there has to be a conflict runs into the same problem as the whole idea of a race to the bottom………………………….. That is why the amount of raw materials needed to make a given product keeps diminishing as productive efficiency improves. With modern production processes, 97 percent less metal is needed for a soft drink can than 30 years ago, partly because of the use of lighter aluminum. A car today contains only half as much metal as a car of 30 years ago. Therefore, it is better for production to take place where the technology exists, instead of each country trying to have production of its own, with all the consumption of resources that would entail. It is more environmentally friendly for a cold northern country to import meat from temperate countries than to waste resources on concentrated feed and the construction and heating of cattle pens for the purpose of native meat production</span>.<br />

Money is a projected conceptual schema- it’s a social language we can use to express how important the environment is to us in a language other people will understand and care about- aesthetics is not- the alternative will never be as effective because it doesn’t tap into our shared cultural understandings of value- this is empirically proven by urban renewal projects designed to beutify inner cities- they have never worked and are heavily resisted by people as being wasteful<br />

<u>Use of the <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">debate can be</span> an <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">effective</span> pedagogical tool ………………………, political critique, and legal defense.</u> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">A debate exercise is particularly suited to an examination of United States foreign policy, which in political science courses is usually studied from a theoretical, often heavily realpolitik perspective. In such courses, international legal considerations are usually given short shrift, if discussed at all. As a result, students may come to believe that international law plays no role in United States foreign policy-making. In fact, serious consideration is usually paid by government officials to international law in the formulation of United States policy, albeit sometimes ex post facto as a justification for policy, rather than as a bona fide prior constraint on consideration of policy options. In addition, lawyers are prominent advisers at many levels of the foreign-policy-making process. Students should appreciate the relevance of international law for past and current US actions, such as the invasion of Grenada or the refusal of the United States to sign the law of the sea treaty and landmines convention, as well as for [*387] hypothetical (though subject to public discussion) United States policy options such as hunting down and arresting war criminals in Bosnia, withdrawing from the United Nations, or assassinating Saddam Hussein.</span><br />

Certainly, dialogue between the two camps has been hindered by the failure of each camp to accept the core assumptions and comprehend the language used by the other. This has led to a widespread failure within mainstream circles to take postmodernist approaches seriously. However, I would argue that the approaches taken by scholars such as James Der Derian, David Campbell, Richard Ashley and R.B.J. Walker at least deserve to be assessed on their own merits. Rather than add to chorus of criticism here,</span> I <span style="font-size: 8pt;">shall</span> question whether the debate between postmodernists and positivists ultimately ‘matters’ in the sense of having a material impact upon the kind of empirical ……………. This would seem to get all who make postmodernist claims into deep philosophical hot water: <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">having said that there is no privileged standpoint from which one can understand the world, the postmodernist</span>, one might argue, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">then seeks to construct one</span>. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Der Derian for instance, berates positivists for supposedly constructing ‘a transcendental, privileged space to make truth-claims about international relations (like those made by game and rational choice theory from the supposed high-point of scientific progress’. He then proceeds — later on in the same article — to illustrate his own truth claim about the global forces of ‘simulation, surveillance and speed’ (<span style="color: #075a90;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.palgrave-journals.com/ip/journal/v45/n2/full/8800222a.html#bib4#bib4" rel="nofollow">Der Derian, 1990</a></span>).</span><br />

This last point demands further elaboration. The</span><u><span style="color: #0e0e0e;"> <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">shrinkage of politics <strong>hardly means</strong></span> <strong>that <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">corporate colonization will be less of a reality</span>, that social <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">hierarchies </span>……………. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">elites</span></strong></span></u> <span style="color: #0e0e0e; font-size: 6pt;">– an already familiar dynamic in many lesser-developed countries. The fragmentation and chaos of a Hobbesian world, not very far removed from the rampant individualism, social Darwinism, and civic violence that have been so much a part of the American landscape, could be the prelude to a powerful Leviathan designed to impose order in the face of disunity and atomized retreat. In this way the eclipse of politics might set the stage for a <em>reassertion</em> of politics in more virulent guise – or it might help further rationalize the existing power structure. In either case, the state would likely become what Hobbes anticipated: the embodiment of those universal, collective interests that had vanished from civil society. 75</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 6pt;">But, in many other countries where capitalism rubs people the wrong way, this is not the case. On either side of the Atlantic, for example, the Latin world is often drawn to anti-capitalist movements and rulers on both the right and the left.

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Of course, discourses abound and the world is represented in different, and often competing, ways. This means that any representation can potentially be contested and so must actively be reproduced. Meanings, in other words, are neither static nor final; rather, they are always in process and always provisional.

As writers such as Niccolo Machiavelli, Max Weber, Reinhold Niebuhr, and . goals be sincere or idealistic; it is equally important, always, to ask about the effects of pursuing these goals and to judge these effects in pragmatic and historically contextualized ways. <u>Moral absolutism</u> inhibits this judgment. It alienates those who are not true believers. It promotes arrogance. And it <u>undermines political effectiveness</u>. <br />
