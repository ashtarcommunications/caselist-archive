However, it has been stated that the additional fees to the USCIS for H-1B Visa and L-1 Visa applications be shouldered by the applicants’ employers, and not by the petitioners themselves. The increase does not affect companies and employees looking to the USCIS to renew or extend the status of their H-1B Visa and L-1 Visa.<br />
<span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Not all employers and H-1B … H-1B Visa or L-1 Visa application.</span></span><br />
On the other hand, petitioners whose company or employers do not fall under the aforementioned criteria are required to submit written evidence, attestation or statements to the USCIS justifying why the new fee increases are not applicable to their H-1B Visa or L-1 Visa application. These evidences or statements should then be submitted to the USCIS alongside any filled out forms, applications and documents pertinent to the H-1B Visa and L-1 Visa petition.<br />
In a teleconference held by the USCIS, it was made clear that H-1B Visa and L-1 Visa applications submitted to the USCIS without the enclosed additional fees will not be out rightly returned or rejected. Instead, the USCIS will promptly issue Requests for Evidence (RFE) for H-1B Visa and L-1 Visa applications where they believe the additional fees are required or the necessary documentation to prove otherwise is either lacking and/or missing.<br />
Public Law 111-230 also explicitly states that these new increases to the H-1B Visa and L-1 Visa petitions come in addition to already existing filing and application charges under the USCIS. For H-1B Visa applications to the USCIS, the additional $2,000 comes on top of the I-129 form fee, the Fraud Fee, the premium processing fee and the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act (ACWIA) fee. For L-1 Visa applications to the USCIS, the additional $2,250 comes on top of the I-129 form fee, the Fraud Fee, and the premium processing fee.<br />
The fee increase was for the explicit purpose of reducing visas.<br />

There, too, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% red;">nations in the region increasingly look to Washington for reassurance, and if they decide the U</span>nited <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% red;">S</span>tates <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% red;">cannot be relied upon they will</span> have to decide whether <strong>to <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% red;">succumb to Iranian influence or build their own nuclear weapons</span></strong> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">to resist it. In the 1990s, after the Soviet Union had collapsed and the biggest problem in the world seemed to be ethnic conflict in the Balkans, it was at least plausible to talk about cutting back on American military capabilities. In the present, increasingly dangerous international environment, in which terrorism and great power rivalry vie as the greatest threat to American security and interests, cutting military capacities is simply reckless. Would we increase the risk of strategic failure in an already risky world, despite the near irrelevance of the defense budget to American fiscal health, just so we could tell American voters that their military had suffered its “fair share” of the pain? The nature of the risk becomes plain when one considers the nature of the cuts that would have to be made to have even a marginal effect on the U.S. fiscal crisis. Many are under the illusion, for instance, that if the United States simply withdrew from Iraq and Afghanistan and didn’t intervene anywhere else for a while, this would have a significant impact on future deficits. But, in fact, projections of future massive deficits already assume the winding down of these interventions.Withdrawal from the two wars would scarcely make a dent in the fiscal crisis. Nor can meaningful reductions be achieved by cutting back on waste at the Pentagon—which Secretary of Defense Gates has already begun to do and which has also been factored into deficit projections. If the United States withdrew from Iran and Afghanistan tomorrow, cut all the waste Gates can find, and even eliminated a few weapons programs—all this together would still not produce a 10 percent decrease in overall defense spending. In fact, the only way to get significant savings from the defense budget—and by “significant,” we are still talking about a tiny fraction of the cuts needed to bring down future deficits—is to cut force structure: fewer troops on the ground; fewer airplanes in the skies; fewer ships in the water; fewer soldiers, pilots, and sailors to feed and clothe and provide benefits for. To cut the size of the force, however, requires reducing or eliminating the missions those forces have been performing. Of course, there are any number of think tank experts who insist U.S. forces can be cut by a quarter or third or even by half and still perform those missions. But this is snake oil. Over the past two decades, the force has already been cut by a third. Yet no administration has reduced the missions that the larger force structures of the past were designed to meet. To fulfill existing security commitments, to remain the “world’s power balancer of choice,” as Leslie Gelb puts it, to act as “the only regional balancer against China in Asia, Russia in eastern Europe, and Iran in the Middle East” requires at least the current force structure, and almost certainly more than current force levels. Those who recommend doing the same with less are only proposing a policy of insufficiency, where the United States makes commitments it cannot meet except at high risk of failure. The only way to find substantial savings in the defense budget, therefore, is to change American strategy fundamentally. The Simpson-Bowles commission suggests as much, by calling for a reexamination of America’s “21st century role,” although it doesn’t begin to define what that new role might be. Others have. For decades “realist” analysts have called for a strategy of “offshore balancing.” Instead of the United States providing security in East Asia and the Persian Gulf, it would withdraw its forces from Japan, South Korea, and the Middle East and let the nations in those regions balance one another. If the balance broke down and war erupted, the United States would then intervene militarily until balance was restored. In the Middle East and Persian Gulf, for instance, Christopher Layne has long proposed “passing the mantle of regional stabilizer” to a consortium of “Russia, China, Iran, and India.” In East Asia offshore balancing would mean letting China, Japan, South Korea, Australia, and others manage their own problems, without U.S. involvement—again, until the balance broke down and war erupted, at which point the United States would provide assistance to restore the balance and then, if necessary, intervene with its own forces to restore peace and stability. Before examining whether this would be a wise strategy, it is important to understand that this really is the only genuine alternative to the one the United States has pursued for the past 65 years. To their credit, Layne and others who support the concept of offshore balancing have eschewed halfway measures and airy assurances that we can do more with less, which are likely recipes for disaster. They recognize that either the United States is actively involved in providing security and stability in regions beyond the Western Hemisphere, which means maintaining a robust presence in those regions, or it is not. Layne and others are frank in calling for an end to the global security strategy developed in the aftermath of World War II, perpetuated through the Cold War, and continued by four successive post-Cold War administrations. At the same time, it is not surprising that none of those administrations embraced offshore balancing as a strategy. The idea of relying on Russia, China, and Iran to jointly “stabilize” the Middle East and Persian Gulf will not strike many as an attractive proposition</span>. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% red;">Nor is </span>U.S<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">. </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% red;">withdrawal</span> from East Asia and the <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Pacific </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% red;">likely to have a stabilizing effect</span> on that region. <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">The </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% red;">prospects of a war on the Korean Peninsula would increase</span>.</strong> Japan and other nations in the region would face the choice of succumbing to Chinese hegemony or taking <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% red;">unilateral steps for self-defense</span>, which <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% red;">in Japan’s case <strong>would mean the rapid creation of a formidable nuclear arsenal</strong></span>. <span style="font-size: 6pt;">Layne and other offshore balancing enthusiasts, like John Mearsheimer, point to two notable occasions when the United States allegedly practiced this strategy. One was the Iran-Iraq war, where the United States supported Iraq for years against Iran in the hope that the two would balance and weaken each other. The other was American policy in the 1920s and 1930s, when the United States allowed the great European powers to balance one another, occasionally providing economic aid, or military aid, as in the Lend-Lease program of assistance to Great Britain once war broke out. Whether this was really American strategy in that era is open for debate—most would argue the United States in this era was trying to stay out of war not as part of a considered strategic judgment but as an end in itself. Even if the United States had been pursuing offshore balancing in the first decades of the 20th century, however, would we really call that strategy a success? The United States wound up intervening with millions of troops, first in Europe, and then in Asia and Europe simultaneously, in the two most dreadful wars in human history. It was with the memory of those two wars in mind, and in the belief that American strategy in those interwar years had been mistaken, that American statesmen during and after World War II determined on the new global strategy that the United States has pursued ever since. Under Franklin Roosevelt, and then under the leadership of Harry Truman and Dean Acheson, American leaders determined that the safest course was to build “situations of strength” (Acheson’s phrase) in strategic locations around the world, to build a “preponderance of power,” and to create an international system with American power at its center. They left substantial numbers of troops in East Asia and in Europe and built a globe-girdling system of naval and air bases to enable the rapid projection of force to strategically important parts of the world. They did not do this on a lark or out of a yearning for global dominion. They simply rejected the</span> <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% red;">offshore balancing</span> strategy, and they did so because they <strong>believed <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">it had </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% red;">led to great, destructive wars in the past and would likely do so again</span></strong>. They believed their new global strategy <strong>was more likely to deter major war and therefore be less destructive</strong> and less expensive in the long run. <span style="font-size: 6pt;">Subsequent administrations, from both parties and with often differing perspectives on the proper course in many areas of foreign policy, have all agreed on this core strategic approach. From the beginning this strategy was assailed as too ambitious and too expensive. At the dawn of the Cold War, Walter Lippmann railed against Truman’s containment strategy as suffering from an unsustainable gap between ends and means that would bankrupt the United States and exhaust its power. Decades later, in the waning years of the Cold War, Paul Kennedy warned of “imperial overstretch,” arguing that American decline was inevitable “if the trends in national indebtedness, low productivity increases, [etc.]” were allowed to continue at the same time as “massive American commitments of men, money and materials are made in different parts of the globe.” Today, we are once again being told that this global strategy needs to give way to a more restrained and modest approach, even though the indebtedness crisis that we face in coming years is not caused by the present, largely successful global strategy. Of course it is precisely the success of that strategy that is taken for granted. The enormous benefits that this strategy has provided, including the financial benefits, somehow never appear on the ledger. They should</span>. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">We might begin</span> by <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">asking about the global security order </span>that <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the U</span>nited <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">S</span>tates<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;"> has sustained since Word War II—<strong>the prevention of major war, the support of an open trading system, and promotion of</strong> </span><strong>the liberal principles <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">of free markets and free government</span></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. How much is that order worth? What would be the cost of its collapse or transformation into another type of order? Whatever the nature of the current economic difficulties,</span> <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% red;">the past six decades <strong>have seen a greater increase in global prosperity than any time in human history. Hundreds of millions have been lifted out of poverty</strong>. Once-backward nations have become economic dynamos</span>. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">And the American economy, though suffering ups and downs throughout this period, has on the whole benefited immensely from this international order.</span> <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">One price of this success has been maintaining a sufficient military capacity to provide the essential security underpinnings of this order</span>. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">But has the price not been worth it? In the first half of the 20th century, the United States found itself engaged in two world wars. In the second half</span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">, <strong>this global</strong> </span><strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% red;">American strategy helped produce a peaceful end to the great-power struggle of the Cold War and then 20 more years of great-power peace</span></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Looked at coldly, simply in terms of dollars and cents, the benefits of that strategy far outweigh the costs. The danger, as always, is that we don’t even realize the benefits our strategic choices have provided</span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">. </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% red;">Many assume that the world has simply become more peaceful</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, that great-power conflict has become impossible, that nations have learned that military force has little utility, that economic power is what counts. This belief in progress and the perfectibility of humankind and the institutions of international order is always alluring to Americans and Europeans and other children of the Enlightenment</span><strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">. </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% red;">It was the prevalent belief in the decade before World War</span></strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% red;"> I</span>, in the first years after World War II, and in those heady days after the Cold War when people spoke of the “end of history.” <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% red;">It is </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">always </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% red;">tempting to <strong>believe that the international order the U</strong></span><strong>nited <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% red;">S</span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">tates </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% red;">built and sustained with its power can exist in the absence of that power</span></strong><strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% red; font-size: 8pt;">,</span></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">or at least with much less of it. This is the hidden assumption of those who call for a change in American strategy: that the United States can stop playing its role and yet all the benefits that came from that role will keep pouring in.</span> <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% red;">This is a great if recurring illusion, the idea that you can pull a leg out from under a table and the table will not fall over.</span></strong> <br />

<span class="DebateUnderline"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">A. ELIGIBILITY</span></strong></span>. Proving eligibility involves … files her application to immigrate. <br />
Substantively, the two most common criteria for establishing eligibility are based on certain family relationships and prospective employment relationships. In family cases, substantive eligibility is established by obtaining approval from CIS of a Petition filed on the immigrant’s behalf by a family member who is a U.S. citizen (&quot;USC&quot;) or LPR, where that USC or LPR Petitioner has a certain, statutorily defined relationship to the immigrant Beneficiary. (Ex.: Husband-wife, parent-child, brother-sister)<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.pbl.net/IMMIGRANT_SELECTION_SYSTEM.doc#_ftn19" rel="nofollow">[19</a>]. In a typical employment-based case, a U.S. employer goes through a multi-step process to prove first to the U.S. Department of Labor (“DOL”) and later to USCIS that the employer should be allowed to hire a particular foreign worker and, as a necessary part of that process, that the foreign worker should be allowed to apply for LPR status. Notably, some employment-based cases do not require DOL involvement. .For example, if the prospective employee has extraordinary qualifications in his field, or his being employed in a particular position in the United States would be in the “national interest”, the U.S. employer may simply file a petition with USCIS thoroughly documenting that fact. <br />

<span style="display: block; text-align: left;"> <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">So far</span></span> President <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">Obama</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> has achieved</span></span> very <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">little</span></span> in the Middle East. <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">However, he <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">still has an opportunity to be a transformative leader who can deliver peace</span></span></span> and <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">security in the region. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">To do so he must</span> now <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">deliver</span> on his promise of change</span></span>, says Alon Ben-Meir . With the peace process at a standstill, President <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">Obama must shake up the current efforts</span></span>, and his Mideast peace team, in order <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">to get the Israelis and Palestinians back on track</span></span> toward a peaceful resolution of their conflict. <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">The</span></span> Obama <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">White House has invested an enormous amount of political capital</span> </span>to advance Middle East peace since taking office, <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">yet has little to show for it</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">.</span></span> Even so, the United States cannot abandon its efforts and leave Israel and the Palestinians to their own devices. It is therefore time to recognize that the current U.S. strategy is not working-significant changes are needed if there is to maintain any hope for reaching a breakthrough in the coming year. The new strategy must begin with President Obama's visit to Israel after the midterm election. Rightly or wrongly, Obama's decision not to visit Israel following his June 2009 Cairo speech and other trips to region was interpreted as a slight to Israel. This month, the President will make his third official overseas visit as President to four Asian countries, including a Muslim majority country, Indonesia, once again skipping Israel and sending the message to the Israeli public that he is uninterested in engaging the Israelis directly. Because of President Obama's long overdue visit to Israel, <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">the Israeli public is</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> becoming <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">increasingly</span></span></span> more <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">skeptical</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> of the President and his administration</span></span>. <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">Although the majority of Israelis support a two-state solution, the public remains passive and</span></span> acutely <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">cynical</span></span> with regard to the current peace efforts. <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">This</span></span> relatively <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">silent majority will only become aroused in support</span></span> of the peace process <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">if they understand what is at stake</span></span>, and why it is in Israel and the United States' best interest to achieve peace now. The Israeli public needs to hear it directly from the President of the United States. President <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Obama must connect with ordinary Israelis and forcefully deliver the message that</span></span> while America's commitment to Israel's national security is unequivocal and unconditional, <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">only sustainable peace offers Israel ultimate security</span></span>. A personal appearance by President Obama before the Israeli Parliament would have a decisive impact on Israel's public opinion and on his own personal standing and credibility in the Israelis' eyes. The President needs to explain that America and Israel are in this together, and that the U.S. will stand with Israel shoulder-to-shoulder and at all times to confront any potential threat from any direction. What <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">the President needs</span></span> is <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">a game changer, and only when the Israeli public subscribes to the peace process with confidence</span></span> and a belief that peace can be achieved with security, <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">will they raise their voice in support</span></span> of peace &quot;now.&quot;</span><br />

font-size: 12pt;">that its window of opportunity for military action is closing, which could prompt a preventive attack; (5) the prospect that Iran’s response to pre-emptive attacks could involve unconventional weapons, which could prompt escalation</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> by Israel and/or the U</span></span>nited <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">S</span></span>tates; <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">(6)</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> the <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">lack of a communications</span></strong> framework <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">to build</span> trust and <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">cooperation</span> </span></span>among framework participants. <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;

<span style="display: block; text-align: left;"> But Mr. <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">Obama has no</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> clear path to <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">approval</span></span></span> of the treaty <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">without</span></span> Senator Jon <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">Kyl</span></span> of Arizona, the lead Republican negotiator, <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">who declared</span></span> this week that <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">there was no time to reach agreement this year</span></span> on a nuclear modernization program that he wanted as the price for ratification. <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The White House has only one Republican supporter</span></span>, Senator Richard G. <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Lugar</span></span> of Indiana. <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">A survey of 14</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> other Senate <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">Republicans who were considered possible supporters found none who were willing to publicly back the treaty</span></span></span>. Ten of them said they were undecided or were waiting for the same assurances as Mr. Kyl, and four did not respond, suggesting that approval may depend on changing Mr. Kyl’s mind. <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">Among those who agreed with</span></span> Mr. <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">Kyl</span></span> that the issue should wait until next year <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">was</span></span> Senator Bob <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">Corker</span></span> of Tennessee, <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">one of three</span></span> Republicans <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">to vote for the treaty in committee</span></span> in September. In an interview, he said that the treaty and modernization program needed to be “fully digested, fully explained” and that there was no reason to rush during the lame-duck session. “I’m very skeptical that it’s the right thing to do and very skeptical that it can be done this December,” he said. Moreover, <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">10 newly elected Republican senators</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> who will take office</span></span> in January <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">signed a letter objecting to a lame-duck vote.</span></span> “Out of respect for our states’ voters, we believe it would be improper for the Senate to consider the New Start treaty or any other treaty in a lame-duck session,” said the letter, which was released by Senator-elect Roy Blunt of Missouri. Mr. <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">Kyl showed no signs of backing down after meeting with</span></span> Senator John <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">Kerry</span></span> of Massachusetts, the Democratic chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. But Mr. Kerry expressed hope afterward that a deal was still possible, and the White House released new details of its commitment to Mr. Kyl to spend $84 billion over the next 10 years to modernize the nation’s nuclear weapons program. </span><br />
<span style="display: block; text-align: left;"> Peace process failure de-rails any hope for the future agenda, that’s Ben-Meir. Obama’s success depends on strength against Netanyahu – which is also key to his foreign policy agenda.</span><br />

<span style="display: block; text-align: left;"> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">According to Israeli press reports, there was satisfaction and even rejoicing in Netanyahu quarters at the results of the elections for the House of Representatives. The assumption is that </span><span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">a majority of Republicans in the House will make it difficult for President Barack Obama to put pressure on the</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> present </span><span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Israeli government in the interest of a credible political process</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. While this appears at first sight reasonable and even probable given traditionally strong Republican support for Israel, it is by no means a given. A great deal depends on how Obama decides which way to go in the coming two years, and whether it is possible for him to achieve any success that may shore up his political capital vis-a-vis Congress. The results of the mid-term elections for the House can largely be explained by domestic and local factors, uppermost among which is the state of the economy. This is largely what brought into being the Tea Party, which oddly enough clamors for unfettered financial capital when this was the very reason why Americans were hard hit by the crisis in the first place. They are determined to deprive Obama of a second term and if the economy does not improve, they and the Republican party as a whole may well succeed. </span><span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">The</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> other <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">option Obama has for</span> possible <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">achievement</span> of some success <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">is foreign policy</span></span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, especially in the Middle East, where traditionally the president has more leeway and is less constrained by Congress. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan bequeathed by the Bush administration have so far not shown themselves to be amenable to a quick solution, and a lot depends on what can be done during the coming year. But the prospects do not seem too auspicious. Then there is Iran. One should expect that the Israeli government will have here an advantage as it can lobby Congress to be even more shrill on Iran in order to pressure Obama to take the military option. Still, another war in the region has severe consequences and is bound to backfire in more than one way, least of which oil prices reaching unprecedented levels. </span><span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">This leaves the sagging “peace process” between Palestinians and Israelis</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. So far, </span><span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">the <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">Obama</span> administration <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">has shown considerable weakness and</span> in fact <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">has been outmaneuvered by</span> </span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin </span><span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">Netanyahu</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The Palestinian Authority was hoping that after mid-term elections Obama would change gears, and so did several other Arab countries. This presumably was based on the assumption that pressure on the Netanyahu government before the elections would turn the matter into an election issue to the detriment of Obama. </span><span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">The question</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> here <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">revolves over whether Obama is willing and able to spend</span> whatever <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">political capital he has left to bring about a settlement</span> to the conflict <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">that</span> can be declared a success and <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">may</span> possibly <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">help in</span> a <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">re-election</span> campaign</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">A solution to the</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> Israeli-Palestinian <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">conflict was declared by more than one official</span></span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, including General David Petreaus, to be </span><span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">a national security issue</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">And <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">on national security issues, the Congress has often balked at facing the president head-on</span></span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. But even if Obama takes this option there may be limits to the kind of pressure he can bring to bear on any Israeli government given the influence of the Israel lobby. The worst-case scenario from the point of view of the Palestinian leadership is Israeli American agreement that “what is possible now” is another “interim” solution – Oslo 2 in effect. Such a prospect is already under discussion in Israel and the idea of a state with “temporary” borders was also raised under the Bush administration. Palestinians rejected this arrangement in the past, but it fears the possibility of intense pressure being exercised by the US and the international community, including possibly some Arab governments. The dangers from a Palestinian point of view are obvious. A temporary arrangement will very likely turn into a permanent one if all major issues are left again to be “negotiated” in the manner of the Oslo process: Jerusalem, borders, refugees, and sovereignty. For after 19 years of negotiations, since the Madrid Conference in late 1991, the Palestinian leadership does not have the credibility or indeed the legitimacy to accept another round of years of negotiations. The Palestinian Authority has reached the end of the line. Already there are public calls for the dissolution of the PA given the lack of clear prospects for an agreement. The idea was even recently raised by some PA officials. For it was never envisioned by Palestinians that the PA would function indefinitely as a large municipality to administer the affairs of Palestinians in the occupied territories. A great deal then depends on the choices President Obama <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">decides to make – and his choices will be crucially important not only for his presidency.</span> </span></span><br />

<span style="display: block; text-align: left;"> Obama has patience and the self-confidence not to insist that his solution is the best and only one.

Congress and the surrounding power centers, swiftly reading weakness in this president, decided they would fill the vacuum Obama left for them. <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">A</span></span> friend and longtime <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">warrior for liberal reforms described</span></span> what unfolded in harsh but accurate terms: &quot;<span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">First <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">he was rolled by the bankers</span>, then</span></span> he was rolled by <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">the generals, then</span></span> he was rolled by <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">the Blue Dogs</span></span> and other Democrats who had no interest in going along with what he proposed.&quot; <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">Obama seemed exceedingly tolerant of resisting forces</span></span> and even cooperated with them. Or maybe he privately agreed with them. He never made it clear. Perhaps because he was young and relatively inexperienced, Obama surrounded himself with savvy veterans of Washington's inside baseball. He inherited his economic advisers from Robert Rubin, his political team from former Senate leader Tom Daschle and center-right Clintonistas like Rahm Emanuel. Together with old friends from the academy, the administration was overstaffed with intellectual abstraction and short on street-smart politicians, especially any harboring liberal instincts. That pretty much ruled out the &quot;change&quot; many voters had expected. It produced a tone-deaf seminar of policy thinkers in which Obama assumed he was hearing all sides. <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">Republican</span></span>s, who are masters of deceptive marketing, seized on Obama's most appealing qualities and turned them upside down. Their <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">propaganda cast him</span></span> not as soft but <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">as</span></span> a power-mad (black) leftist, destroying democracy with <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">socialist</span></span> schemes. The portrait was so ludicrous and mendacious, <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">the president</span></span>'s party <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">hardly bothered to respond</span></span>. Egged on by the Republican Party and Fox News, right-wing frothers conjured sicko fantasies and extreme accusations: the president is not only a black man (bad enough for the party of the white South); he is not even American. The vindictive GOP strategy is racial McCarthyism, demonizing this honorable man as an alien threat, just as cold war Republicans depicted left-liberal Democrats as commie sympathizers. <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">Even</span></span> Obama <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">supporters began to ask, Where is the figh</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">t in the man?</span></span> Some critics blame a lack of courage, but that neglects the extraordinary nerve Obama displayed in his rise to the White House—a young black man with an unusual name and limited experience who triumphed through his audacity. Obama's governing style is a function of his biography—a man who grew up always in the middle, both black and white. He succeeded by learning rare skills, the ability to bridge different worlds comfortably and draw people together across racial, political and intellectual divides. He learned to <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">charm and disarm</span></span>, not to smash and conquer. For the first time in his life, those <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">qualities seem to have failed</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> him</span></span>. Indeed, he may have been misled by his high regard for his own talents. This is really his first encounter with devastating political defeat. The question now is, What will he learn from his &quot;shellacking&quot;? Possibly not much, since it is always very hard to rethink and adjust in midstream. But remember, this man is an unusually observant politician with a great thirst for self-reflection. One can reasonably hope that as he absorbs the hard knocks, he will make calculated changes in how he governs. Bluntly put, <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">Obama needs to learn <strong>hardball</strong></span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">. People saw this</span></span> in him <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">when he fired</span></span> Gen. Stanley <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">McChrystal</span></span>, and many of us yearn to see more. If he absorbs the lesson of power, he will accept that sometimes in politics you can't split the difference or round off sharp edges. <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">He has to push back aggressively and stand his ground</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">, more like those ruthless opponents trying to bury him. If Congress won't act, the president will</span></span>. But first he has to switch from cheerleading to honest talk. Tell people what the nation really needs, what Republicans intend to sabotage. <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In a political street fight, you've got to hit back</span></span>.</span><br />

<span style="display: block; text-align: left;"> Jonathon <span class="Author-Date"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Cook, 11-19</span></span>-2010, “Obama’s Bride” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.intifada-palestine.com/2010/11/obamas-bribe/" rel="nofollow">http://www.intifada-palestine.com/2010/11/obamas-bribe/</a></span><br />
<span style="display: block; text-align: left;"> Watching the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians drag on year after year without conclusion, it is easy to overlook the enormous changes that have taken place on the ground since the Oslo Accords were signed 17 years ago. Each has undermined the Palestinians’ primary goal of achieving viable statehood, whether it is the near-trebling of Jewish settlers on Palestinian land to the current numbers of half a million, Israel’s increasing stranglehold on East Jerusalem, the wall that has effectively annexed large slices of the West Bank to Israel, or the splitting of the Palestinian national movement into rival camps following Israel’s withdrawal from Gaza in 2005. Another setback of similar magnitude may be unfolding as Barack Obama dangles a lavish package of incentives in the face of Benjamin Netanyahu in an attempt to lure the Israeli prime minister into renewing a three-month, partial freeze on Jewish settlement construction in the West Bank. The generosity of the US president’s package, which includes 20 combat aircraft worth $3 billion and backing for Israel’s continued military presence in the Jordan Valley after the declaration of a Palestinian state, has prompted even Thomas Friedman of The New York Times to compare it to a “bribe”. Israeli officials said yesterday they were still waiting to see a text of the deal worked out between Netanyahu and the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, in seven hours of negotiations. In addition to the concession in the Jordan Valley and the offer of combat jets that would effectively double the annual aid from the US, the deal is said to include a promise by Washington to veto for the next year any UN resolutions Israel opposes and to refrain, after borders have been agreed, from demanding any future limits on settlement growth. The signs are that Netanyahu will be able to secure the backing of his right-wing cabinet for a brief settlement freeze that this time, the US has indicated, will not include East Jerusalem. <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">So far, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">in attempting to resolve the conflict, Obama has nearly exhausted his political capital</span>. There were intimations this week that <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">the White House could not afford further humiliation and was going for broke</span></span></span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">. </span><span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">The timetable</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> for negotiations <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">now calls for</span> reaching <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">an agreement on borders within three month</span></span></span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">s</span> — the duration of the settlement construction freeze — <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">followed by a final resolution of the conflict within a year or so</span></span>. <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Washington’s hopeful logic is that a renewal of the freeze will be unnecessary in three months because an agreement on borders will already have established whether a settlement is to be considered included in Israel’s territory and therefore permitted to expand or inside Palestine and therefore slated for destruction.</span></span> In a similarly optimistic vein, the US apparently expects the problem of refugees simply to dissolve through the creation of a special international fund to compensate them. The right of return appears to be off the table. If these obstacles can be surmounted this way – a very big “if” – only one significant point of contention, the future of East Jerusalem, remains to be resolved. This is where things get more awkward. The US is not proposing that the three-month freeze apply to East Jerusalem, after settlement-building there caused friction between Israel and the US during the last moratorium. This concession and the outlines of a previous US peace proposal under president Bill Clinton hint at Washington’s most likely strategy. East Jerusalem will be divided, with the large settlement blocs, home to at least 200,000 Jews, handed over to Israel while the Old City and its holy places fall under a complicated shared sovereignty. In the face of this intense US-Israeli diplomacy, Palestinians are dismayed. They have described the agreement between the US and Netanyahu as “deeply disappointing” and are demanding from the White House similarly generous inducements to ease their path back to negotiations. The Arab League, which has taken a prominent role in overseeing the Palestinian negotiations, has also objected to the deal. The Palestinians fear they will be left with a patchwork of disconnected areas – what Israel has previously termed “bubbles” – as their capital. If the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, can be made to swallow all this, which seems highly improbable, he will then have to contend with Hamas, the rival Palestinian faction, which can be expected to do everything in its power to disrupt such an agreement. And then there is Netanyahu. Few Israeli analysts think he has suddenly become more amenable to the US plans. Neve Gordon, a politics professor at Ben Gurion University in the Negev and author of an important study of the occupation, believes the Israeli prime minister is simply playing the part demanded by Obama. “He is taking the US ‘merchandise’ on offer, but will hold firm on key issues that guarantee the talks’ failure. That way he gets the credit for keeping the negotiations on track and lets the Palestinians take the blame for walking out.” This sounds suspiciously like a re-run of the last proper peace talks, at Camp David in 2000. Then, Israeli intransigence stalled the negotiations, but Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, was blamed by the US and Israel for their collapse. The Camp David failure led to the outbreak of Palestinian violence, the second intifada, and the demise of the Israeli peace camp. Mr Netanyahu may be prepared to risk a repeat of both such outcomes from these talks if it means he can avoid making any real concessions on Palestinian statehood. </span><br />

<span style="display: block; text-align: left;"> What is of more interest to me, however, is what her selection reveals about the basis of presidential power. Political scientists, like baseball writers evaluating hitters, have devised numerous means of measuring a president’s influence in Congress. I will devote a separate post to discussing these, but in brief, they often center on the creation of legislative “box scores” designed to measure how many times a president’s preferred piece of legislation, or nominee to the executive branch or the courts, is approved by Congress. That is, how many pieces of legislation that the president supports actually pass Congress? How often do members of Congress vote with the president’s preferences? How often is a president’s policy position supported by roll call outcomes? These measures, however, are a misleading gauge of presidential power – they are a better indicator of congressional power. This is because <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">how members</span> of Congress <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">vote on a</span> nominee or <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">legislative item is rarely influenced by anything a president does. Although journalists</span> (and political scientists) often <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">focus on the legislative “endgame” to gauge presidential influence</span> – will the President swing enough votes to get his preferred legislation enacted? – <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">this mistakes an outcome with actual evidence of presidential influence</span></strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">. Once we control for</span> other factors – a member of Congress’ <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">ideological and partisan leanings</span>, the political leanings of<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;"> her constituency</span>, whether she’s up for reelection or not – <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">we can</span> usually <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">predict how she will vote without needing to know</span> much of anything about <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">what the president wants.</span> (I am ignoring the importance of a president’s veto power for the moment.) <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">Despite</span> the <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">much publicized</span> and celebrated <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">instances of presidential arm-twisting</span> during the legislative endgame, then, most <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">legislative outcomes don’t depend on presidential lobbying</span></strong>. But this is not to say that presidents lack influence. Instead, the primary means by which presidents influence what Congress does is through their ability to determine the alternatives from which Congress must choose. That is, presidential power is largely an exercise in agenda-setting – not arm-twisting. And we see this in the Sotomayer nomination. Barring a major scandal, she will almost certainly be confirmed to the Supreme Court whether Obama spends the confirmation hearings calling every Senator or instead spends the next few weeks ignoring the Senate debate in order to play Halo III on his Xbox. That is, how senators decide to vote on Sotomayor will have almost nothing to do with Obama’s lobbying from here on in (or lack thereof). His real influence has already occurred, in the decision to present Sotomayor as his nominee.</span><br />

<span style="display: block; text-align: left;"> Last week I was surprised when <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">pro-Israel</span></span> and well-known Jewish politician, New York Mayor Michael <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Bloomberg, expressed his support for the construction of the Islamic Center</span></span> near the wreckage of the World Trade Center’s twin towers. The news of the center continues to draw the negative attention of media outlets, many of which have questioned whether Muslims have the right to build Islamic institutions in the United States. Moreover, media coverage of the Cordoba Initiative’s plans to build an Islamic community center in Manhattan has been largely inaccurate. Many of the facts have been changed or misreported: the center has been described as a mosque, when in fact it is a community center with a mosque, and the location has been described as Ground Zero, when in reality the center is two blocks away and shares the neighborhood with a strip club and gambling parlor. In addition, the community center intends to open its doors to non-Muslims, and will contain a number of social and recreational activities. The center will have a swimming pool, a gym, a theater, a restaurant, a library, an art gallery and studios, and a memorial to the victims of September 11th. However, misleading reports have created widespread and popular opposition against building the center. Nor is Bloomberg alone in his support for building the center. Many other <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">Jewish rabbis and leaders</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> across the U</span></span>nited <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">S</span></span>tates <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">have lent their support</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> to the project</span></span>. In fact, the <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">support among the Jewish community has been <strong>so</strong> <strong>vociferous</strong> that when</span></span> Abraham <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">Foxman</span></span> of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">spoke out</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> against the center, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">thousands of American Jews responded by signing a petition supporting the Cordoba Initiative</span>’s plans. </span></span> The problem is the United States is less than three months away from midterm elections, and many politicians are using the center as a campaign issue. Politicians have used the construction of an Islamic community center near Ground Zero to play on voter fears about Islamic influence in American society, and in doing so have encouraged the spread of false information. Fortunately, the <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">Cordoba</span></span> Initiative and Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">have handled the subject positively. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">Despite the</span></span></span> political circumstances and approaching <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">elections</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">, they have <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">succeeded in <strong>communicating effectively</strong> with many American leaders and individuals</span></span></span>. The <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Cordoba</span></span> Initiative <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">has also mobilized significant support</span></span> for the center and managed to overcome legal obstacles, which will allow construction to begin soon. Although some are still trying to convince the project managers to change the location of the center, they have been unsuccessful thus far. It has not been easy for the Cordoba Initiative to attract support for its center from Jewish and Christian leaders. For the past several years, Arab community leaders and Muslim scholars led by men like Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf, have been reaching out to the American public through <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">interfaith projects</span></span>. In addition, they have sponsored joint programs to <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">serve local communities. These efforts have fostered <strong>new friendships across the religious divide</strong></span></span>. One example is the Adams Mosque near Washington, DC. Last Ramadan, the Adams Mosque was over capacity with worshipers for late-night prayers. Needing extra space, the Imam of the mosque, Majid, approached a local synagogue, who agreed to let the Muslim worshippers use their space. Such experiences are positive examples of how Jewish and Muslim communities have been redefining their relationship. <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Many assumed that the Jewish-American community would be the first to cry foul over the Islamic community center</span></span> in lower Manhattan. There is a tendency to view Muslims and Jews as traditional enemies, given the history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Increasing dialogue and cooperation, however, is turning these stereotypes on their head. Some <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">Muslims and Jews are</span></span> even <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">finding common ground for joint projects by <strong>building a consensus</strong> on sensitive issues like the</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> Israeli-Palestinian <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">conflict</span></span></span>, agreeing on the need for a two-state solution as well as the importance of security and freedom for Israelis and Palestinians alike.</span><br />

The delegation, which <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">included</span></span> U.S. Reps. William <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">Goodling</span></span> (R- PA), Tom <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">Ewing</span></span> (R-IL), Nancy <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">Pelosi</span></span> (D-CA), Constance <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">Morella</span></span> (R- MD), Peter <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">King</span></span> (R-NY), John <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">Mica</span></span> (R-FL), <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">and</span></span> Ciro <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">Rodriguez</span></span> (D- TX), visited both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland at a critical point in the peace process and the search for lasting peace and justice on the entire island. After meeting with political leaders, concerned citizens, and both elected and appointed officials including Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, and Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, the members were <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">encouraged</span></span> that the will of the Irish people, both north and south, will eventually be carried out for a new and peaceful north. <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">New</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> power sharing <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">arrangements</span></span></span>, as provided for in the Good Friday Accord, as well as respect for human rights and the diversity of both traditions on the entire island, can and must come soon to Northern Ireland, as the peace process moves forward. While in Belfast, the delegation released a letter from the bipartisan leadership of the House, including Speaker Dennis Hastert and Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt, which served as a call for &quot;root and branch&quot; reform of the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), as a central ingredient for &quot;a Northern Ireland police service that will be the pride of all its people, and that will protect the human and civil rights of each and every citizen.&quot; In Cork, Gilman, Chairman of the House International Relations Committee, said at the University College, &quot;if the hopes of the Good Friday Peace Accord are met there should be no limit to the entire island's leadership role as a partner in the transatlantic relationship with Europe.&quot; In Derry, <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">Walsh</span></span> met with young students with whom he had participated earlier this year in a teleconference to further understanding of how the U.S. Congress works.

Signed by President Clinton in December of last year, the law will provide 4,000 non-resident visas a year for three years to residents of both traditions in the north and border counties. Participants, who must be between the ages of 18 and 35, will spend up to three years in the U.S. learning a trade and experiencing life in a true multicultural society. <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The</span></span> so-called &quot;<span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 12pt;">Walsh Visa</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&quot; law is <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">the only U.S. legislation associated with the Irish Peace Agreement</span></span></span>.</span><br />

<span style="display: block; text-align: left;"> The statements by Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad about wiping Israel off the map are not qualitatively new and resemble those by other Iranian leaders. Their reiteration at a time when Iran is under pressure on the nuclear issue, however, suggests increasing extremism on the part of the Iranian leadership towards Israel, as well as diminished sensitivity towards international public opinion. Even if it is unlikely, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">the possibility that a fanatical group</span>, whether within the regime or a faction emerging from a split in the leadership, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">will gain control of nuclear weapons and decide to use them </span>against Israel <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">cannot be </span>categorically <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">ruled out</span>.
