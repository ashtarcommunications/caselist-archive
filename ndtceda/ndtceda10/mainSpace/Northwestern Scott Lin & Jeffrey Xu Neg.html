Security K 1NC<br />
<br />
The aff deploys security discourse to guide changes to the visa system – this creates a system of complex border control where admissibility of the immigrant is wholly dependent on their contributions to the national state. This discursive strategy enables the state to exploit immigrants by tying their legal status to employment and to institute exceptional policies through recourse to fears of terrorism.<br />

Salter (ibid:82 ... ) argues that governments … of ban-opticon as a whole.<br />
This process of securitization spills over – it doesn’t stop at immigration. Any time a new social process is willfully inserted into the matrix of security, the state expands its self-appointed authority to institute exceptional policies – and render them the rule. The issue is not one of exercising security in the abstract but introducing security where it does not belong.<br />

What is the condition that can trigger … are in this case not first of all judicial but indeed existential.<br />
The Alternative: Desecuritize migration. <br />
Security is socially manufactured and can be undone – the 1AC has chosen to tie certain assumptions about how political community is constituted to the enaction of their plan. The alternative lets us reconfigure this political community – desecuritization means imagining an alternative way of organizing the political not founded upon the expansion of security logic. <br />

The affirmative engages in a Faustian bargain – the plan trades collusion with neoliberal structures of domination for the inclusion of a select few GLBT individuals into US national life. This selective inclusion is the basis for establishing a model of the “good homosexual” – one that mirrors heteronormative forms of oppression.<br />

The dark underside of the aff’s bargain is a matrix of surveillance and subjectification – the terms of their contract with the state demand that only those same-sex couples who embody neoliberal norms be admitted for incorporation into the United States. Furthermore, a system of affidavits and a culture of homophobia ensure that same-sex couples will continue to face overwhelming discrimination – even as they shape themselves into good homosexuals.<br />

Additionally, the distribution of visas as a political strategy for inclusion injects sovereign adjudication into migration --- turns the case by making all inclusion temporary and fleeting<br />

The good homosexual embraces conservative US nationalism. The bargain “he” has made is the foundational ground for US imperialism: Implicit in integration into the national public is complicity with the construction of various enemies to the state – those deemed terrorists, illegal immigrants, even GLBT who embody too-radical forms of sexuality. The state offers a promise of incorporation in exchange for support for its acts of violence.<br />

We should refuse the bargain. <br />
The state’s promise holds only the certainty of genocide exercised at a global level. Participation in the neoliberal state’s filtered forms of migration not only props up a militarized global lockdown but endangers movements towards GLBT liberation – even as elite GLBT reap the gains of neoliberal participation, neoconservative forces criminalize their existence. Only refusal of the promise project can solve. It’s not a question of mass activism or consciousness shifting but how we as academics deal with this history of oppression.<br />

Interrogating the aff’s strategy for political inclusion is a prior question to policy proposals. Delinking sovereignty from mobility and questioning the ontological suppositions of the plan solve the case better by creating an avenue for true emancipation for migrants. The alternative is a prerequisite to respecting queer identity. <br />
