Plan: The United States Federal Government should no longer enforce the requirement that an individual must have cooperated and be willing to cooperate with reasonable requests for assistance by federal, state, or local law enforcement in investigating or prosecuting crimes related to human trafficking in order to obtain a T visa.<br />
<br />
Human trafficking is a means to degrade women at the hands of the men that own them. They treated as less than human and forced to engage in risky sexual behaviors for no pay. Traffickers use the illegal status of the women and the risk of deportation as a means of total control over the victims, leaving them powerless to seek help<br />

More generally, agent autonomy is ….. burden of such a society.<br />

A radical reconception of war and peace is required if we are ever to effect meaningful change. The violation of a person’s body through trafficking is a form of war designed to disable and destroy. Since the violation of ones body is used as a means of perpetuating war it should be seen as one each and every time an individual is trafficked<br />

The absence of war is not peace – the idea that preventing a war means there is peace ignores the reality of patriarchal domination and ensures war will continually occur<br />

Our argument is not that we should let everyone die or engage in pessimistic politics but that the way we view conflict is inherently flawed and that misconceptions skews appropriate decision making. Conflict can happen without violence.<br />

Trafficking is a form of psychological warfare that convinces women they have no choice but to stay with their trafficker. This bond created through violence, threats, and coercion often overwhelms any fears of the police and makes women unable or unwilling to testify against their traffickers<br />
Joycelyn M. Pollocka &amp; Valerie Holliera (Department of Criminal Justice, Texas State University) “T Visas: Prosecution Tool or Humanitarian Response?” Women &amp; Criminal Justice 20: 1, 127 — 146 April 13, 2010 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08974451003641172" rel="nofollow">http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08974451003641172</a><br />
<br />
Another problem that prevents ….percent, victims are retrafficked (Rieger 2007).<br />
<br />
The psychological stress induced as a result of this process is often so severe that free will is not restored immediately upon rescue. This initial lack of cooperation is misperceived as compliance with trafficking and forces the trafficked back into exploitation and patriarchy. This is exacerbated by current legislation that assumes that only the “iconic” version of a victim is to be believed and helped.<br />
Jayashri Srikantiah (Associate Professor of Law and Director, Immigrants’ Rights Clinic, Stanford Law<br />

Ultimately, trafficking is a form of modern day slavery where traffickers use any means necessary, including lack of immigration status, to control the actions and behaviors of their victims<br />

Changes in the industry, however, are ….than the last.<br />
<br />
Decoupling the requirement to testify from the T visa actually increases the likelihood and quality of the testimony received. Even more, the increase in survivor participation in the political struggle is critical to expanding and fully understanding the human trafficking problem<br />

Domestic anti-trafficking efforts …. from immigration relief.<br />

Even if not entirely effective the victim oriented approach to trafficking promotes safety of women, breaks the cycle of trafficking, allows them to testify against their captors and reclaim the lives that were stolen from them by trafficking<br />

2. Advantages to the “Protect the Victim….. future harm and victimization.<br />
<br />
To be clear this is not solely a narrative about the plight of women coerced into sexual slavery. It is about the broader narrative of human trafficking and its implications for modern day policy. It is not solely an issue of whether trafficking legislation is good or bad. It is a question of how we frame these debates about trafficking to include discussions from all points of view.<br />

Put away your outdated util file. Your discussion of utilitarianism is based on an outdated form of utilitarianism that fails to account for changes in the literature.

Transnational organized crime contributes to and thrives on the recent and growing trend of ungovernability that is undermining the ability of many states to carry out their traditional functions……………..

Failed states pose one of the deepest challenges to American national security and international peace and stability.

<br />
Presenting the ambiguous definition of trafficking and its related terms provide a foundation for the varied meanings associated with the concept of trafficking……………...

The aff criticizes the notion that there is an iconic vision of a victim to be helped and be believed (Sritankiah ev).

<br />
The re-inscription of western imperialism and colonialism is evidenced through the creation and implementation of trafficking policies. …………….When western policy makers and feminists homogenize experiences and ignore contextual differences, this leads to a disregard of the historical, cultural and socio-political background of migrants.<br />

Perm do both<br />

Perm do the plan and all non-competitive parts of the alt<br />
Other forms of victimization still exist which means the alt cant solve. Default to specific rejections of bad victimization<br />
Not identifying trafficked individuals as victims causes them to be subject to punishment by the state and increases the risk of being retrafficked. It is necessary in the policy context<br />

An essential component of effective anti-trafficking legislation that addresses both the supply and demand factors for trafficking in persons is to define trafficked persons as &quot;victims.&quot; …………………However, there is a need to increase the awareness of the general public in both countries of origin and destination, and of the consumers of sexual services in countries of destination, that trafficking is not a victimless crime.<br />

Despite such aspirations, however, early reports suffered from inconsistent coverage and disagreements over what constituted a &quot;consistent pattern of gross violations.&quot; …………….Similarly, some scholars suggest that as &quot;accurate and unbiased human rights reporting has become an intrinsically important goal for many key actors within the [State] Department,&quot; the reports have improved. n145 Intense congressional debate and outside scrutiny provide an additional quality check.<br />

Control over independent regulatory agencies has traditionally resided with Congress, which created all of them. ……………………If the American people believe that the president should be responsible for the actions of the SEC, it will be difficult to convince them otherwise.

The incentive to avoid notice-and-comment rulemaking through interpretive rulemaking has increased over time, as both the time and cost of notice-and-comment rulemaking has increased. ……………..This scrutiny has led both Congress and the executive branch to impose substantial procedural and analytical requirements on agency rulemaking beyond those required by the Administrative Procedure Act. n30<br />

Cooper 2009 – contributing editor at Conde Nast Portfolio and The Washington Monthly (Matthew, 1/13. Politico. &quot;Bush and the era of D.C. as fortress&quot;, lexis)<br />
<br />
That strange, contentious day seemed to set the tone for the next eight years in Washington and the extraordinary circumstances they have encompassed:……………... Bush's first treasury secretary, Paul O'Neill, and his initial director of the White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives, John Dilulio, complained widely of political interference.<br />
<br />
The President still has to spend capital in congress. Congress people are more likely to pressure for changes in the CP than in the plan because they are removed from public backlash<br />

<br />
Another problem with the theory of agency expertise is the assumption that agencies are sufficiently insulated from politics to make their decisions scientifically, rather than politically………….Perhaps agency lawmaking is somewhat more removed from legislative politics than is congressional lawmaking, but, in acting behind closed doors to pressure agencies, members of Congress are largely free from electoral accountability.<br />

These changes, along with low rates of acceptance for refugee status in most European countries, transformed public and official attitudes towards those seeking asylum. Increasingly, asylum seekers were characterized in public discourse as “economic refugees”……………. It was not suprising, then, that asylum become mired in political controversy in countries as different as the United States, Netherlands, Italy, and Germany.<br />

<br />
An analysis of asylum statistics conducted by two academic experts revealed that the percentage of asylum seekers who are found by the INS to not satisfy the exceptions to the filing deadline actually increased……………... As a result women with deserving asylum claims – like “Oumou Amine” who sought asylum based on her fear of FGM (see previous page) – have been denied asylum based on the filing deadline.<br />

<br />
Trafficking is fundamentally different from asylum, another widely publi- 1. cized human rights issue that also is closely intertwined with immigration law…………………...

Under the 1996 immigration law asylum seekers are subject to “mandatory detention,” and are held in detention facilities and jails……………... For refugee women – many of whom have suffered unspeakable abuses – detention can be particularly traumatizing.<br />

 <br />
Plan:<br />
The United States federal government should provide T visas to victims of child trafficking for the purposes of intercountry adoption as victims of severe trafficking<br />
The status quo does not view baby selling as a form of child laundering. As a result, little or no protections exist under the TVPA exist for the victims of child trafficking. In fact, child theft is incentived due to lack of legal recourse or protections<br />

<span class="UnderlineChar">Legitimate intercountry adoption provides a permanent family placement…………….., including the non-applicability of national and international laws pertaining to trafficking</span>. <br />
Contention 2 is the neocolonist mindset<br />
Intercountry adoption is rooted in the neo-colonialist mindset. The desire to “save” the savages from their unwilling parents props up the idea of intervention and imperialism the world over. The plan shatters that mindset and breaks down neo-colonialism<br />

<span class="SmalltextChar">Answering this question requires reasoning by analogy………………………..</span><span class="UnderlineChar"> intercountry adoption remains rooted in a kind of neo-colonialist mindset. </span><br />
This mindset is particularly relevant to the trafficking of children and is rooted in the ideology of neocolonialism. Even more, the concept of removing a child for a “better life” here in the United States justifies genocide against any group we don’t deem worthy of existing<br />

<span class="UnderlineChar">The viewpoint that it is permissible to take children from their original families …………………..removed in order to destroy, in whole or part, that group</span>. <br />
There is massive incentive for child trafficking and eventual laundering. This is hidden under the guise of a “better life” for the child and renders those children and families invisible<br />

<br />
<br />
This reifies a regime of orientalist commodification – they are the mail order brides of children. They are purchased and trafficked to “save them” from their home life but this altruism is really only a justification for a global system of racist exchange<br />
