<strong>The Modern Visa System Continues This History of Exclusionary Isolation Through Categorized Requirements – If Immigrants Do Not Have X,Y, or Z, They Cannot Be Equal to Us as Citizens, No Matter Their Personal Story.

<strong>Thus, Gerald and I reject the entire visa system, a form of hard border politics, and instead advocate a shift to a “soft border”.</strong> <br />

<strong>Observation 3: Advocacy</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>By advocating a soft border, Tristan and I adopt the stance of the Politizen, the figure always standing both inside and outside the concept of citizenship. Affirming the Politizen, we recognize that we there are limited areas of engaging with politics. However, this resolution demands action; the debate community, abiding with a norm to only endorse policy plans that are topical, is turning a blind eye to the inherent exclusionary practices of the visa system. As politizens, we have decided this blindness must be addressed.</strong> <br />
