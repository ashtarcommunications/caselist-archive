The United States should offer to negotiate a Code of Conduct for acceptable space practices with any other interested space faring nation that would prohibit the testing or deployment of anti-satellite weapons and would create joint mechanism for cleanup of space debris and offer China gradual cooperation in the International Space Station if they agree. The U.S. federal government should establish ten ten-million dollar annual prizes for the development of te<strong>chnology for space colonization,</strong> commercialized space technology<strong>, and nanotechnology.</strong> Each prize recipient should be honored at an awards ceremony hosted by the President of the United States. The Center for Responsible Nanotechnology should create an international administration of molecular nanotechnology. The CRN should establish a self-contained, secure <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.crnano.org/crnglossary.htm#Molecular" rel="nofollow">molecular manufacturing</a></span> system with a <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.crnano.org/bootstrap.htm" rel="nofollow">personal nanofactory</a></span> to be developed in a closely guarded crash program. The personal nanofactory should be released for widespread use. All MNT capability should be administered by this international body with product designs being reported and tracked. The administration should include restriction infrastructure and a board of technology evaluators as per the CRN’s proposal.<br />
