 <span class="Underline">A. Conflict and antagonism is constitutive of the human experience and the social body. The world is not objective but made up of different perspectives, world views, paradigms, and ontologies. There will forever be conflict when these realities or paradigms bump up against each other. These antagonisms are fundamental and ineradicable. The affirmative engages in a style of politics that attempts to forever erase or eliminate the antagonisms that structure our existence. The affirmative does not understand though, that these conflicts cannot be solved, cannot be erased, and cannot be exterminated, it is a false and ultimately disastrous hope. The affirmative engages in a politics of utopian fantasy construction in response to the constitutive antagonisms that hopes to eliminate them to create some better or lost world of harmony. This style of politics is necessarily violent and genocidal. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">B. Instead of responding to increased uncertainty, instability, and conflict with another affirmative genocidal utopian fantasy, the alternative is to accept these antagonisms as ineradicable and constitutive of the human, social, and political order. We must establish a different relationship to these antagonisms. Vote negative to attempt the institutionalization of this lack within political reality. Vote negative as your democratic duty. </span><br />
