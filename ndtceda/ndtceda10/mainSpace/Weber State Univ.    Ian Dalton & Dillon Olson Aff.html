 <span class="underline"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">Hi my name is Dai,* I’m a survivor of human trafficking and exploitation. I have experienced the harm that these forms of violence inflict on those of us who have been sexually exploited</span></span><span class="CardsChar"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Let me tell you a little history about my life</span></span><span class="underline"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">. I have been an American for nearly 21 years</span></span><span style="color: #343434; font-size: 8pt;">. Abused as a child, I made a promise to myself that I would never be abused again. As I continue with my speech</span><span class="underline"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">, I’m here to share my story specifically regarding my traumatic experience in the sex trafficking. </span></span><span style="color: #343434; font-size: 8pt;">One question that has always perplexed me is the need to share my experiences, and what I witnessed in Las Vegas without exploiting myself. An integral part of my story is that </span><span class="underline"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">I, and many other minority women</span></span><span style="color: #343434; font-size: 8pt;">, whether American or not, </span><span class="underline"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">were shipped from state to state in order to provide specific services for men. It has been stated by many that the sex industry has been divided into two distinct classifications: prostitution and trafficking. I encourage you to listen to my story as I reveal to you why I believe they are one and the same.</span></span><span style="color: #343434; font-size: 8pt;"> In 1995, </span><span class="underline"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">I fell in love with a military man, who persuaded me to move with him to an undisclosed remote area. There, I was raped and beat continually while handcuffed to a door of an abandoned house</span></span><span style="color: #343434; font-size: 8pt;">. Eventually, through circumstances, I made my escape, but not before he had confiscated my naturalization papers, driver’s license and social security card. With no proof of my identity, I could not acquire adequate shelter</span><span class="underline"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">. I felt like an animal that has been cast into the street.</span></span><span style="color: #343434; font-size: 8pt;"> My life became a scenario of sojourning from one homeless shelter to another.</span> <span class="underline"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">One day, I was approached by a </span></span><span style="color: #343434; font-size: 8pt;">middle-aged woman who had been watching my every move. Unaware that she was a (</span><span class="underline"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">Female Pimp), she insisted that I come and work for her in the Escort Service (she assured me that it was only a dating service</span></span><span style="color: #343434; font-size: 8pt;">). </span><span class="underline"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">My unawareness of this proposition was so overwhelmed by my need for food, money and clothing that I desperately accepted her offer. After several weeks I found myself well provided for and economically stable. Then the unthinkable happened: a client bargained me for sex. After I refused his offer, he grabbed me by the hair, forced me on the floor and raped and beat me.</span></span><span style="color: #343434; font-size: 8pt;"> In terror, I fled to the police to report the violence. To my astonishment, the police informed me that I had no rights because I had attained the status of a “street-walker”. Eventually, </span><span class="underline"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">the female pimp</span></span><span style="color: #343434; font-size: 8pt;"> who recruited me </span><span class="underline"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">sent me to this gentleman</span></span><span style="color: #343434; font-size: 8pt;"> who worked in Nevada </span><span class="underline"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">where my experience in Human Trafficking began</span></span><span style="color: #343434; font-size: 8pt;">. To this day, </span><span class="underline"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">I am still haunted by flashbacks regarding certain smells</span></span><span style="color: #343434; font-size: 8pt;">, as well as cold floors which numbed my bare feet. Many times, panic ensues when I find myself in a line of women; it resurrects the nightmares of all the humiliating inspection line-ups I had to endure. </span><span class="underline"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">We were constantly paraded before a potential client; their lustful eyes examining and perusing us before we became final choices for each predatory customer. </span></span><span style="color: #343434; font-size: 8pt;">Being Korean, I remember the time when a prejudiced ‘john’ demanded that I dress as a Japanese prostitute/geisha. </span><span class="underline"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">My vulnerability was made complete when I was taught to speak broken English, fulfilling the racist image of exoticism. Although, I was one of the few that spoke and understood English, my required masquerade as a foreigner brought more money to the Master through harboring of immigrants. There is no difference between trafficking and prostitution when innocent women and children are being harbored for the sole purpose of the commercial sex trade. Exploiters and pimps are always violating the rights of these victims who are pursuing their freedom to escape from harm. </span></span><span style="color: #343434; font-size: 8pt;">In reality, </span><span class="underline"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">no female desires to be a part of this nightmare. Most of us were incarcerated in basements, underneath casinos and in abandoned warehouses. Our desperate cries for help were silenced by the walls, which separated us from the rest of the world</span></span><span style="color: #343434; font-size: 8pt;">. While tourists roamed the streets of Las Vegas admiring the architectural beauty and the celestial lights, which permeated the night sky, </span><span class="underline"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">we, the victims, were in perpetual fear for our lives. The Master</span></span><span style="color: #343434; font-size: 8pt;">, knowing full well that I was an American, </span><span class="underline"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">forced me to work both the Escort and the Trafficking. If I refused or didn’t comply, I was taken underground and sentenced to various methods of punishment. The vividness of this maltreatment brought back such </span></span><span style="color: #343434; font-size: 8pt;">childhood </span><span class="underline"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">nightmares </span></span><span style="color: #343434; font-size: 8pt;">of the times I was locked in a closet. Each of these two scenarios mirrored the same cries for freedom; after all, I was the submissive little foreign girl who was threatened not to tell anyone. In both cases, my guilt-ridden confessions of bad behavior resulted in my temporary release. On my knees, I had to convince my Master that I would be on my best behavior. </span><span class="underline"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">After hours of interrogation, I was given permission to return to do what I did best; being a concubine, and deluding myself into thinking that I enjoyed it. I was involved in trafficking for more than six months. I compare that time to being held hostage in a timeless existence where my mind engaged itself in disassociation with my soul.</span></span><span style="color: #343434; font-size: 8pt;"> This mental state was the only way in which I could keep any sanity. Repeatedly, </span><span class="underline"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">I witnessed the beatings, rapes and murders of innocent women. At times, my tears of hopelessness would drown me into a pathos of my own execution. How could my own country not be aware of these cruelties? How could this kind of discrimination and slavery be given the power to blind immigrant and American women of their rights</span></span><span style="color: #343434; font-size: 8pt;">? The frustration of these and other questions echoed within my catatonic mind. Most of the time we were transported by trucks with drivers who were not naive to our purpose, and well informed of our identity. After months of these transports for trafficking </span><span class="underline"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">our self-images had been reduced to cattle being loaded on a cattle car. Thousands of dollars were exchanged on these cross-country trips which kept us silent and our existence a secret.</span></span><span style="color: #343434; font-size: 8pt;"> There were times that the warehouse truck would stop, the tail gate door forced opened, then two or three were summoned out.We were given shoes and clothing so we would not appear as homeless refugees. We had to walk a block down to a near by truck stop, given fifteen minutes to bathe ourselves, then return to the truck. In degrading humiliation we had to beg for toiletries and other personal items. Sometimes, a policeman would appear on the scene and I would be so tempted to cry out for help, but fear of jeopardizing my life and the lives of the other women prevented me. The quick shower and change of clothing signaled our soon “rendezvous” with the ‘johns’ who requested for us. The women were released a few at a time so as not to raise any suspicion. Selections of adult-aged women and minor girls (who were under the age of sixteen) usually numbered between twenty and fifty. The adult women were expected to resemble a late teen. If they would not comply they were discarded, cast-out, and some were never heard from again. We were constantly monitored, forbidden to make eye contact with anyone in public areas. When we arrived at our destination, the women were separated into motel rooms. We traversed the very rural area of Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Texas, California, Florida, and New York. </span><span class="underline"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">We were never paid directly, however, later on I discovered that it would turn more money if clients were deceived into thinking that all of us were immigrants. After months of ongoing physical and mental agony I became apathetic regarding my life; I did not care if I lived or died</span></span><span style="color: #343434; font-size: 8pt;">. With convincing death threats from my Master, I remained silent. If he suspected that I was going to expose him he would verbalize threats against my family and friends</span><span class="underline"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">. It was at this time that I soul searched an alternative way to reveal this horror to the public. </span></span><span style="color: #343434; font-size: 8pt;">Anyone can locate escort services, brothels, bathhouses and strip clubs in the yellow pages, newspapers, and brochures which detail the variety of girls they have to offer. As for the Trafficking business, they sought out clientele by word of mouth, on the Internet, personal references and very powerful people who were involved on the inside. This creates a distraction for the sex trade businesses, which continually harbors immigrants as slaves. The sex trade pimps are incredibly organized, know how to blend into society and stage criminal activity as though it is “business as usual.” The scary scenario is not the everyday casual clients, but it is the established businessmen, the upper echelon trustees and the government officials which are also clientele.</span> <span class="underline"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">America needs to have its eyes open to this reality which is happening twenty-four hours a day. People need to understand that the master minds behind the sex trafficking are very clever, creative, deceptive and cautious regarding their services and the way in which they enslave women against their will.</span></span><span style="color: #343434; font-size: 8pt;"> It is important to understand that pimps emerge from diverse social backgrounds. The majority of the ones with which I had contact, (who were responsible for the trafficking recruitment) had attained status and wealth.Even though language barriers prevented my communication with these women, we shared the same relentless fears. </span><span class="underline"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">Somehow, we also shared the dim ray of hope that maintained our survival. I remember, at different times, holding each of them in my arms letting their tears stain my clothing, while all along, sharing the same</span></span><span style="color: #343434; font-size: 8pt;"> pain. Though English was my one advantage, I was just as lost, confused and terrified. However, </span><span class="underline"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">within the depths of this hell I was experiencing, my will to survive was the fire which kept alive my vision of exposing trafficking to the public. </span></span><span style="color: #343434; font-size: 8pt;">Finally, I was able to escape from my master through a wealthy client who bought me for an undisclosed amount of money. He was an older gentleman with considerable influence. Through his kindness I planned my way of another escape. He admired my oriental beauty and encouraged and coached me to be a (female pimp). He bought my companionship with jewelry, money and expensive cars: He never physically abused me. With ulterior motives he taught me how to make my own money as a Las Vegas Madam (Female Pimp). Therefore, </span><span class="underline"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">to escape the daily abuse of the sex industry, I found myself recruiting women and leading them into the same vile profession which had terribly traumatized me. I was deceived and controlled by the power it gave me. </span></span><span style="color: #343434; font-size: 8pt;">Down the road, I got to the point where I could not stomach what I was doing; repeating the very pattern which held me captive for so long. I may not have abused these women the way my Master did to me, but I did sell them. I used large amounts of narcotics to escape the reality of my immoral empire. </span><span class="underline"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">When I realized I could not escape the recurring nightmares of women locked in basements, warehouse trucks and cheap dirty motels. I was hurled into a major mental breakdown.</span></span><span style="color: #343434; font-size: 8pt;"> Coming to terms with my situation, I ran away from the ‘john’ who bought me. Fearing the possibility of being kidnapped and returned to Las Vegas, I began to seek refuge in churches, seeking their assistance in my quest for deliverance and freedom.</span> <span class="underline"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">Upon leaving Nevada, I was constantly on the run from former pimps. My life resembled a fugitive fleeing from one location to another.</span></span><span style="color: #343434; font-size: 8pt;"> In the fall of 2000, I made contact with an advocate through the Internet, she advised me to relocate to a different state. Since then, I slowly began to heal, trust, and reinvent myself to return to society to make positive contributions</span><span class="underline"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">. I long to reach out to those who are still imprisoned in the revolving door of sexual exploitation. Truly, their shackles can be broken by people who are willing to tear down the walls of silence, and offer them the hope of freedom. They robbed me of five years, they thought they could break me. Yet, I am still standing and I will stand and voice my experience for the victims who are still held in captive of human trafficking. </span></span><span style="color: #343434; font-size: 8pt;">*Names have been changed for security purposes.

</span><br />
Woman’s relationship to the Symbolic order is one of radical exclusion. She can never appear in the Symbolic order <em><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">as woman</span></em> because woman is what is excluded so that the Symbolic may gain consistency. So, we begin with a series of questions about the Mother Tongue…<br />
<span class="cite">Irigaray 1987 </span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">[Luce, “Is the Subject of Science Sexed?” in <em><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Hypatia </span></em>2.3] </span><br />
<span style="margin-right: 3.0pt;"><span class="underline">Certain questions can… simply procreation, is lacking.  </span></span><br />
<br />
We see the effect of the Symbolic exclusion of women everywhere: in culture, in law, in interpersonal relationship. For example, the dominant narrative of trafficking occludes the sexuality of women in that they are wrongly painted as passive victims that are always lured and tricked into passive victim roles. This narrative strips women of their agency and places the focus on the role of the male alone.<br />
<span class="cite">Berman 2010 </span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">[Jacqueline, PhD. Principal Analyst, Berkeley Policy Associates, “Biopolitical Management, Economic Calculation and ‘Trafficked Women’” in <em><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">International Migration</span></em>, Vol. 48 (4) 2010] </span><br />
<span class="underline">In this</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> racialized </span><span class="underline">environment…. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">imminent’’ security threats. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> </span><br />
Perhaps this is because woman stages the ontological limit of the subject: the very gesture which opens up the space for the subject’s symbolization is absolute negativity, and woman occupies this space because the Real can only be expressed in the form of the very void-experienced generated by the broken character of Symbolic existence. Woman is the Symbolic become itself.<br />
<span class="cite">Feldner and Vighi 2007</span> [Helko and Fabio, <em><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Zizek Beyond Foucault</span></em>, pp. 205-207]<br />
<span class="underline">On the strength of… the guise of ‘not-all’.  </span><br />
<br />
Woman <em><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">is</span></em> the phallus—and, paradoxically, this is why she is radically excluded from the Symbolic. <br />
<span class="cite">Homer 2005</span> <span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">[Sean, Senior Lecturer at City College, <em><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Jacques Lacan</span></em>, pp. 98-100] </span><br />
<span class="underline">From a Lacanian perspective… ‘being’ the phallus. </span><br />
<span class="underline"> </span><br />
The Lacanian reading of the Phallus radically transforms Freud’s notion of penis-envy: because everyone lacks the phallus, the theory of penis-envy is revealed as Man’s attempt to transmute woman’s desire into a monstrous reflection of its true nature and so ensure the narcissistic victory of man’s desire over the autonomy of the world. <br />
<span class="cite">Irigaray 1985</span> <span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">[Luce, <em><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">The Speculum of the Other Woman</span></em>]</span><br />
<span class="underline">What is the relationship of that… the sexual market.</span><br />
<br />
The death drive in the symbolic order is always resolved through the male never the woman. A female resolving of the death drive means that the feminine will always be rendered as passive objects. She is condemned to a state of psychosis and hysteria. <br />
<span class="cite">Irigaray 1985</span> <span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">[Luce, <em><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">The Speculum of the Other Woman</span></em>, pp. 53-55]</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">So let us speculate that things…. and its practice? </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> </span><br />
The affirmation of the femininity through the acceptance of menstruation as difference is necessary to break down the patriarchal construction of woman being the void between being and non-being. This patriarchal construction paints the feminine as desiring the void in a search for her wholeness. Only through our affirmation of the stable feminine identity can we achieve this. <br />
<span class="cite">Irigaray 1985</span> <span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">[Luce, <em><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">The Speculum of the Other Woman</span></em>, pp. 166-167]</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Theoretically there would be no such thing as woman. She would not exist. The best that can be said is that she does not exist yet. </span><span class="underline">Something of her a-specificity… its natural wholeness</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">7 </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> </span><br />
<br />
Attempts to fill the void left by patriarchy create an impossible fantasy that only results in violence. This discourse only leads to scapegoating, blaming a group for the inability to achieve the fantasy, which results in their extermination. Without challenging the causes of this, violence will always resurface and plague humanity. <br />
<span class="cite">Stavrakakis 99</span> <span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">[Yannis, teaching fellow at the department to Government at the University of Essex and director of the M.A. program in Ideology and Discourse Analysis<em><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"> Lacan and the Political</span></em>.] </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">What I will try to do in this…. highly problematic area (seminar of 18 June 1958) </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> </span><br />
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">This perpetuates patriarchy through depicting the feminine as passive tradable subjects. </span><br />
<span class="cite">Irigaray 85</span> <span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">(Luce Irigaray, French Feminist and Psychoanalyst, <em><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">This Sex Which is Not One,</span></em> pp. 170-171)</span><br />
The <span class="underline">society</span> we know…. transaction among men alone<br />
<br />
<br />
Masculinity’s bid for universality presents itself as a universal container in which the conflicts of particularity are fought. This erases the conflictual nature of existence; the only universal is the rupture itself, the incommensurability of sexual difference, which reveals the excesses generated by symbolization.<br />
<span class="cite">Feldner and Vighi 2007</span> [Helko and Fabio, <em><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Zizek Beyond Foucault</span></em>, pp. 208-209]<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">What we have here…. </span><span class="underline">consubstantial with every symbolisation. </span><br />
<br />
<br />
Woman can never be caught: we hold no illusion that buried deep inside us is some treasure worth being loved.<br />
<span class="cite">Feldner and Vighi 2007</span> [Helko and Fabio, <em><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Zizek Beyond Foucault</span></em>, pp. 203-204]<br />
