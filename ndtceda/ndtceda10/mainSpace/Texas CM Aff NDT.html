 Two Questions Haunt Us As We Research This Topic.<br />
First, How Should We Gather Knowledge? Especially In Research Encounters That Defy Our Expectations?<br />
Second, What is Our Obligation to Respond To Migrant Experiences That We Can Neither Know Nor Feel?<br />
The 1AC Experiments With Emotional Reflection<br />
We Perceive-Feel-Value the Resolution with Generosity of Perception—As Ben Anderson Puts it<br />
Your Ballot Cultivates a Structure of Feeling.<br />
Respond With Generosity of Perception—A Willingness to Be Surprised—A Capacity to be Affected By Encounters That exceed your reckoning. <br />
We offer 3 guideposts<br />
First, reflexivity.<br />
What drives us to research, to hope, to despair, to develop politics?<br />
Brenda Gray says that “reflexivity”—<br />
(Breda Gray, Senior Lecturer in Sociology at Lancaster University, 2008 [“Putting Emotion and Reflexivity to Work in Researching Migration” <em>Sociology</em> 42<em>:</em> 935)<br />
Reflexivity…section of the article<br />
Second, Affect—Flows of Emotion Between Bodies That Energize Thought, Feeling, and Engagement<br />
Third, Structure of Feeling—<br />
Gray uses the phrase “Structure of feeling to describe”—<br />
(Breda Gray, Senior Lecturer in Sociology at Lancaster University, 2008 [“Putting Emotion and Reflexivity to Work in Researching Migration” <em>Sociology</em> 42<em>:</em> 935)<br />
Reflexivity…section of the article<br />
Immigration policy emerges from networks of visceral attachement—AFFECT comes before cognitive deliberation in the visa context<br />
(Edbauer 2008 [Rice, Jenny Edbauer (2008) “The New “New”: Making a Case for Critical Affect Studies,” Quarterly Journal of Speech, 94: 2, 200—212, JP Miller])<br />
The essays in…section of the article<br />
Generosity of Perception<br />
How should our research encounter migrants?<br />
How can we learn to be affected by what we can neither know nor feel? <br />
Temporary worker visas draw attention to perception.<br />
Etymologically, visas are a knowing-watching, their exercise of violent will and division<br />
(Breda Gray, Senior Lecturer in Sociology at Lancaster University, 2008 [“Putting Emotion and Reflexivity to Work in Researching Migration” <em>Sociology</em> 42<em>:</em> 935)<br />
“It’s visas” implies the USFG is doing the watching, after all, “the USFG” reduces to “that only-one standing awake at the helm.”<br />
(Encyclopedia of Indo-European culture 1997 “Guest” By J.P. Mallory, Douglas Q. Adams p. 249)<br />
Visa goes back to the Indo-European root wei<br />
[Etymology Explorer from Jacob Robertson <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://roots.jrobertsons.com/roots/etymologies/V/VI/VIS/word_VISOR_95690.html" rel="nofollow">http://roots.jrobertsons.com/roots/etymologies/V/VI/VIS/word_VISOR_95690.html</a>]<br />
Porkonoy offers more on this root—this source lists violence as one of its derivations<br />

PAGE 6 AND 7 ARE CITE LISTS<br />
But perception is also feeling-moving<br />
Gray notes that:<br />
(Breda Gray, Senior Lecturer in Sociology at Lancaster University, 2008 [“Putting Emotion and Reflexivity to Work in Researching Migration” <em>Sociology</em> 42<em>:</em> 935)<br />
The etymology of migrant goes back to the The Indo-European Root “Meigw-.”—Meaning to change and exchange<br />
For These societies, encounters with strangers offered three options for Meigw-Exchange:<br />
(Encyclopedia of Indo-European culture 1997 “Guest” By J.P. Mallory, Douglas Q. Adams p. 249)<br />
“Ghostis.”<br />
Are Immigrants guest or hostile, friend or foe?<br />
The Indo-European root “ghostis” lies behind our words guest host hostile…to nomads:<br />
(Oxford Intro to P-I-E…p.249)*2<br />
Ghostis-Moved from the Indo-European to Greek as the word Xenos—A word for foreigners and enemies—but also immigrants and friends. Today we talk of Xenophobia.<br />
The Romans spoke hospitalities by combining Ghostis with power—Today Americans call visas hospitality<br />
George Pavlich invokes “Ghostis” as “allegorical footing” for the uncertainty of research encounter<br />
(George Pavlich 2005 [Professor of Sociology University of Alberta Law and Critique (2005) 16: 95-112)<br />
Yet Pavolich warns that—<br />
Critique—visas—debate—hospitality—all involve encounters on the thresh-hold of generosity and power. As pavlich writes:<br />
( )<br />
But this resolution reduction is not a starting point for politics<br />
Ghostis is instead an allegory for the contradictions of research encounter—ghostis can mean guest, host, as well as hostile<br />
Research that attempts to host new meanings also risk mastery—learning involves openness to experiences that threaten our preconceptions.<br />
Anderson writes that—<br />
Affective imperatives will emerge amidst research encounters—but through experiments in generosity of perception…<br />
(Ben Anderson, Prof Geography at the University of Durham, 2005 [“Practices of judgment and domestic geographies of affect” <em>Social and Cultural Geography]</em><br />
<em>Initially it would…making of disconnections</em><br />
<br />
How should we perceive-feel-encounter the resolution? <br />
We multiply its potential rather than judge it a hostile instrument of cooption<br />
Pavlich cites a quotation from Michel Fouault:<br />
( OED )<br />
Or, as Pavlich writes, cultivates:<br />
( OED )<br />
The Word Resolved Calls into attention to perception, as indicated by the OED<br />
( OED “Perception)<br />
Or More analytically:<br />
(OED “Resolved”)<br />
To Be resolves involves working on the topic’s meaning. The OED offers the definition<br />
( OED )<br />
The 1AC renders transformation through perception and interpretation. The OED cites a definition used regularly since 1397:<br />
( OED )<br />
The OED offers more recent examples of this usage, such as:<br />
( OED )<br />
The Gift<br />
The Limits of present visa policy confronts us as a debt<br />
What must we do?<br />
Visa beneficiary eligibility reflects the impossibility of giving without expectation of return.<br />
The beneficiary eligibility is the object of “gift” (oed) and reduces to the root “deu” meaning give.<br />
A benefit is a deu-dhe, a gift deed. It is generosity set in it’s place<br />
(OED, “Benefit”)<br />
The OED’s first definition of expand is:<br />
(OED “expand”)<br />
Temporary worker visa beneficiaries are the recipients of an expansive gift-display. Thomas Hanson argues:<br />
(Thomas Blom Hansen and Finn Stepputat 2007 Sovereign Bodies: Citizens, Migrants, and States in the Post-Colonial World <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/i7996.html" rel="nofollow">http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/i7996.html</a>)<br />
the sovereignty of…national imaginaries<br />
The Uncertainty of Visa expectations is demonstrated specifically in the Maryland Crab Industry<br />
(Tara Bahrampour, 7/15/2010, The Washington Post)<br />
Hundreds of Mexican…expand the program<br />
that United States Federal Government should substantially expand its beneficiary eligibility for the giving of non immigrant temporary worker visas.<br />
Should’s oldest root trace back to “(s)kell” meaning guilt or debt<br />
(OED “Shall” 4)<br />
Today Should flows between the “past tense of shall” and the subjunctive—what is both certain and in doubt, past and future. Should traces in a thresh-hold between guilt uncertainty and complacent expectation. Its meaning moves depending on emotional inflection<br />
These tensions are reflected in hthe OED<br />
(Shall the past tense should with modal function)<br />
Is the resolution a debt? Perhaps should invokes:<br />
(OED Shall 8)<br />
The 1AC encounters a crack in the resolutional meaning by demonstrating its polysemy—there are many interpretations<br />
This is what Ceccarelli calls “hermenueutic depth”—when a “critic recognizes…both an interpretation and its opposite are sustained”<br />
(Leah Ceccarelli, Assistant professor of communication at the university of Washington, 1998, Quarterly journal of speech 84: 4, 395-415)<br />
When one thinks of text…persuaded by messages<br />
Anderson writes that:<br />
( (Ben Anderson, Prof Geography at the University of Durham, 2006 “becoming and being hopeful: towards a theory of affect” <em>Environemtn and Planning D:</em> Society and Space, 2006, volume 24, pages 733 – 752)<br />
Affect comes as…hints at the uncertainty<br />
This is a mode of perception in our research encounters—not a politics of giving<br />
The 1AC experiements with the resolution’s multiple meanings to cultivate capacities for enchanted perception—a prerequisite to change in a world otherwise doomed to the total entropy of the same. As Anderson writes:<br />
(Ben Anderson, Prof Geography at the University of Durham, 2006 “becoming and being hopeful: towards a theory of affect” <em>Environemtn and Planning D:</em> Society and Space, 2006, volume 24, pages 733 – 752)<br />

Breda Gray, Senior Lecturer in Sociology at Lancaster University, 2008 [“Putting Emotion and Reflexivity to Work in Researching Migration” <em>Sociology</em> 42<em>:</em> 935)<br />
We are all familiary…research practice<br />
Experiment, Encounter, Network<br />
We expect to learn about the visa policy implementation—but engagement also rquires topical reflection on perceptual tendencies—what does it mean to cross borders of knowledge and concern?<br />
Experiments with everyday debate practices crack through the resolution as a frozen lake of meaning—cultivating capacities for creative perception<br />
(Leet 2006 (Senior research at the Brisbane institute with Roland Bleiker “from the sublime to the subliminal: Fear, Awe, and Wonder in International Politics” <em>Millenium</em> v 34<br />
Conventional practices…domination of life<br />
Creative learning welcomes experiments with unexpected meaning. The debate network is a complex adaptive system—it self organizes through non linear interactions between arguments debaters judges and decisions. Promises of stable equilibrium are an illusion—any organization of argument is only a work in progress<br />
