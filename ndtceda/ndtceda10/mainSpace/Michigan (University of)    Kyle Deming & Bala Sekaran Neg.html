Round 3 - Neg vs MSU HR<br />

The United States federal government should create an uncapped technology visa, identical to the H-1B program in every way except only limited to one renewal period and excluding dual intent provisions.<br />
<br />
The counterplan solves the aff – it targets high-skill jobs with labor shortages and eliminates all problems with the H-1B visa cap<br />
Robb, 99 – US Senator from Virginia (Charles, AMERICA'S WORKFORCE NEEDS IN THE 21ST CENTURY, S. HRG. 106-929, 10/21, lexis Congressional)<br />
I see two main problems with continuing...These are problems that only education can solve.<br />
<br />
The only difference between the plan and the counterplan is that the H-1B allows a permanent residence option while the counterplan is truly temporary – this facilitates better brain circulation and prevents brain drain.<br />

More broadly, it seems clear that trade...to the regular H-1B program.<br />

Finally, this book is not primarily about public policy...the entrepreneurial ecosystem in America’s technology regions.<br />
<br />
<br />
The permutation fails to generate the same level of brain circulation – it creates 2 uncapped categories, which means immigrants will choose the plan’s option, not the counterplan’s. Leaving the H-1B category capped means immigrants will be forced to choose the CP.<br />

We begin by making a stylized distinction between...both countries are better off.<br />
<br />
<br />
There are many alternative visa proposals to the H-1B – the dual intent clause is the only important difference. Even if the CP text is slightly different from the solvency evidence, focusing on dual intent is hardly unfair. This evidence proves the CP is predictable and the aff should be prepared<br />
Bagchi, 5 (Indrani, “H1-B is passe, ‘W’ visa is hot,” The Times of India, 8/4, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/H1-B-is-passe-W-visa-is-hot/articleshow/1190405.cms" rel="nofollow">http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/H1-B-is-passe-W-visa-is-hot/articleshow/1190405.cms</a>)<br />

The term “immigrant” situates difference only in relation to a hegemonic identity of nativist cultural belonging and is appropriated by elites to further marginalize people of color through institutional racism<br />

We must first recognize the existence ...to be re-evaluated and corrected.<br />

Words matter; this debate matters. Rigorous attention to vocabulary which reinforces privilege is a starting point for resistance, where an aff ballot only reinforces the structures of privilege which make racism appear invisible to identities situated in positions of power.

<br />
<strong><span style="color: black;">The President should issue an executive order establishing an independent export control commission within the National Security Council to balance national security risks with economic interests for export controls. The executive order should apply sunset provisions to items unilaterally placed upon the export control list and have the commission review the placement of every item every 12 months, and create an economic competitiveness exemption that eliminates export control on dual-use technologies when they are available on open markets outside the United States. The executive order should require that a visa applicant in a nanotechnology field or graduate study program should receive a determination on the visa application within 30 days, should provide a one-year automatic visa extension to international students to remain in the United States to seek employment, and should institute a skills-based preferential processing system that gives priority to nanotechnology fields in all visa applications, and allow nanotechnology graduates to file for a change in status without regard to priority date currency. The executive order should allow automatic work permits to any international students in nanotechnology fields seeking to remain in the United States </span></strong><br />
