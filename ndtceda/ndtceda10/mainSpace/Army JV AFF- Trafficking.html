 <br />
<br />
A. In the status quo, human trafficking is one of the largest sectors of international organized crime. The current version of the TVPA does not offer adequate protection to trafficking victims.<br />
Congressional Research Group 2006 Trafficking in Persons: The U.S. and International Response <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://italy.usembassy.gov/pdf/other/RL30545.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://italy.usembassy.gov/pdf/other/RL30545.pdf</a><br />
<br />
B. Eligibility for T-Visas is currently too narrow; this is a function of the restrictive language of the TVPA. Current language is written with a view towards prosecution of traffickers, and places victim identification in the hands of prosecutors; this results in many trafficking victims being made ineligible.<br />
Srikantiah 7 Associate Prof of Law and Director of Immigrants Rights Clinic @ Stanford Law School (Jayashri, “Perfect Victims and Real Survivors: The Iconic Victim in Domestic Human Trafficking Law” Boston University Law Review Vol 87: 157-211).<br />
making determinations based on her own conception of who is a deserving trafficking victim. <br />
<br />
<br />
C. Reform now is key-- The status quo drives trafficking underground, as trafficking victims are unwilling to come forward to prosecutors for fear of prosecution and deportation. Removing the conditions on T-visas is necessary to fight trafficking.<br />
Angel 8 Legislative Counsel to US Congressman Nadler Carole, “Immigration Relief for Human Trafficking Victims: Focusing the Lens of the Human Rights of Victims” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://digitalcommons.law.umaryland.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1026&amp;context=wle_papers" rel="nofollow">http://digitalcommons.law.umaryland.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1026&amp;context=wle_papers</a><br />
<br />
Thus the plan:<br />
<br />
The United States Federal Government should amend the Trafficking Victims Protection Act to adopt the standards for trafficking provided by the United Nations Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children.<br />
<a name="_Toc271731428"></a><br />
Observation 2 is Solvency<br />
<br />
A. Currently the “force, fraud, and coercion language” of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act does not meet the standards set in the UN Protocol on Trafficking.<br />
Giampolo 06 (Angela D., J.D. “THE TRAFFICKING VICTIMS PROTECTION REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2005: THE LATEST WEAPON IN THE FIGHT AGAINST HUMAN TRAFFICKING” <br />
<br />
B. The U.S.’s approach confuses and undermines the U.N.’s Trafficking Protocol’s definition of trafficking required to foster international cooperation<br />
Chuang 10 (Janie, Assistant Professor of Law, American University “RESCUING TRAFFICKING FROM IDEOLOGICAL CAPTURE: PROSTITUTION REFORM AND ANTI-TRAFFICKING LAW AND POLICY,” 158 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1655)<br />
1AC- Solvency<br />
<br />
<br />
C. Amending the TVPA expands the number of people with access to the State to secure their human rights and avoid slavery<br />
Chacon, 06 [Jennifer M. Chacon, Assistant Professor, University of California, Davis, School of Law, MISERY AND MYOPIA: UNDERSTANDING THE FAILURES OF U.S. EFFORTS TO STOP HUMAN TRAFFICKING, 74 Fordham L. Rev. 2977, May, 2006, lexis]<br />
<br />
Advantage 1 is Terrorism<br />
<br />
A. Adopting the UN Protocol allows for the creation of a standard worldwide database.<br />
Chuang 10 (Janie, Assistant Professor of Law, American University “RESCUING TRAFFICKING FROM IDEOLOGICAL CAPTURE: PROSTITUTION REFORM AND ANTI-TRAFFICKING LAW AND POLICY,” 158 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1655)<br />
<br />
B. Increased data sharing capability is key to tracking terrorist groups<br />
Keefer 06 (Sandra L. United States Army Colonel “HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND THE IMPACT ON NATIONAL SECURITY FOR THE UNITED STATES,” USAWC STRATEGY RESEARCH PROJECT, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&amp;AD=ADA448573)BB" rel="nofollow">http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&amp;AD=ADA448573)BB</a><br />
<br />
C. Nuclear terrorism is the greatest threat facing national security. A nuclear terrorist attack would cause millions of deaths and untold destruction in a matter of seconds.<br />
Rhodes, 10 ( “Reducing the nuclear threat: The argument for public safety” By Richard Rhodes | 14 December 2009. Bulletin of Atomic Scientists) <br />
<br />
Advantage 2 is Human Rights<br />
<br />
A. The “force, fraud, and coercion” clause excludes many victims and leads to increased deportations of trafficking victims.<br />
Harvard Law Review 06 (“Remedying the Injustices of Human Trafficking through Tort Law,” Harvard Law Review, Vol. 119, No. 8 (Jun., 2006) p.2581-2582 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/4093518" rel="nofollow">http://www.jstor.org/stable/4093518</a> mrw)<br />
<br />
B. Deportation of trafficked people only allows for them to be further traumatized, ostracized from their home societies or re-trafficked.<br />
Haynes 08 (Dina Francesca, ARTICLE: (NOT) FOUND CHAINED TO A BED IN A BROTHEL: CONCEPTUAL, LEGAL, AND PROCEDURAL FAILURES TO FULFILL THE PROMISE OF THE TRAFFICKING VICTIMS PROTECTION ACT,” Georgetown Immigration Law Journal, Spring 2007, Lexis, mrw)<br />
<br />
C. Trafficking is the ultimate form of dehumanization.<br />
DeMarco 7 – [Caitlin, intern in the Ronald Reagan Memorial Internship Program at Concerned Women for America Jul 12, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cwfa.org/articles/13418/BLI/dotcommentary/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cwfa.org/articles/13418/BLI/dotcommentary/index.htm</a>]cn<br />
We have all heard the catchy song lyrics about &quot;what happens in Mexico&quot; staying in Mexico or the advertisements about &quot;what happens in Vegas&quot; staying in Vegas. Ambassador Lagon addressed that fallacy. <br />
<br />
D. The dehumanizing motivations that legitimize and foster human rights abuses, like those occurring in the human trafficking industry, is at the root cause of war and conflict. It permeates all ATROCITIES and until it is addressed we will continue to see a cycle of suffering and violence.<br />
Berube ’97 (David, Ph.D. in Communications, “Nanotechnological Prolongevity: The Down Side”, NanoTechnology Magazine, June/July 1997, p. 1-6, URL: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cla.sc.edu/ENGL/faculty/berube/prolong.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cla.sc.edu/ENGL/faculty/berube/prolong.htm</a>)<br />
<br />
Advantage 3 is International Norms<br />
<br />
A. The best long term solvency for human rights atrocities is increased support of established international human rights promotion mechanisms.<br />
Amann 2008. (Diane Marie, Symposium: Human Rights in the United States, Harvard Human Rights Journal)<br />
B. By adopting the UN standards for trafficking the plan is supporting international human rights norms, thus promoting the Universality of Human Rights, which elevates the power of the discourse.<br />
Baxi 98 (Upendra, Professor Of Law At The University Of Warwick, Fall, 8 Transnat'l L. &amp; Contemp. Probs. 125, &quot;Voices Of Suffering And The Future Of Human Rights,&quot; L/N) <br />
<br />
C. The language of human rights empowers people to make demands on their societies, questions political practices, and prevent atrocities.<br />
Baxi 98 (Upendra, Professor Of Law At The University Of Warwick, Fall, 8 Transnat'l L. &amp; Contemp. Probs. 125, &quot;Voices Of Suffering And The Future Of Human Rights,&quot; L/N) <br />
<br />
D. Engaging in discourse of universality of human rights is necessary to create and maintain the concept of indispensability of the Other, which is key to resisting oppression and dehumanization.<br />
Baxi 98 (Upendra, Professor Of Law At The University Of Warwick, Fall, 8 Transnat'l L. &amp; Contemp. Probs. 125, &quot;Voices Of Suffering And The Future Of Human Rights,&quot; L/N) <a name="_Toc271731430"></a><br />
<br />
Advantage 4 is Soft Power<br />
<br />
A. Lack of HR credibility is lowering US influence now<br />
Hongju 2009 (Harold Hongju professor of international law at Yale Law School , “Speech: Repairing Our Human Rights Reputation,” Lexis) <br />
<br />
B. Government activism to solve gender issues is key to gaining trust and cooperation and maintain influence<br />
Culpepper 10 (Brent, “Missed Opportunity: Congress's Attempted Response to the World's Demand for the Violence Against Women Act,” 43 Vand. J. Transnat'l L. 733, Lexis)BB<br />
<br />
C. US decline in the international sphere will explode into transition wars, maintaining influence and soft power is key to peace<br />
Brzezinski 05 (Zbigniew, The Choice: Global Domination or Global Leadership, p. 2-4; National Security Advisor in the Carter Administration, Professor of Foreign Policy at Johns Hopkins University)
