<strong>Our aff is still relevant and unique</strong><br />
Hans <strong>Kristensen</strong>, 4/8/<strong>2010</strong>. Director of the Nuclear Information Project @ Federation of American Scientists. “<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.fas.org/blog/ssp/2010/04/npr2010.php" rel="nofollow">The Nuclear Posture Review</a>,” FAS Security Blog, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.fas.org/blog/ssp/2010/04/npr2010.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.fas.org/blog/ssp/2010/04/npr2010.php</a>.<br />
At the same time<u>, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">the new NPR comes across as</span> a <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">surprisingly cautious</span> document</u> <u>that</u> recommends curtailing the U.S. nuclear posture further in the future but for now <u>preserves many of the key nuclear weapons force structure and policy elements of the previous administration</u>. Proliferators and Peer Adversaries The truly new in this NPR is that a good portion of it has very little to do with the U.S. nuclear posture and more to do with policies intended to curtail the spread of nuclear weapons to others. As such, this NPR has a much broader horizon than previous versions. A much needed update. The NPR illustrates how proliferation has had and continues to have a real effect on U.S. nuclear weapons policy. This is most vivid in the sections dealing with the role of nuclear weapons and regional deterrence. In the end, however, the NPR illustrates that proliferation is a side-chapter for the sizing and characteristics of the U.S. nuclear posture, which continues to be dominated by planning against Russia and China. As such, it is in the regional mission that most of the change that President Obama has promised may eventually emerge. Clarifying the Nuclear Carrot <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">The NPR adopts a much needed simplification and clarification of the U.S. negative security assurance</span></u>, an important “carrot” intended to help persuade countries not to acquire nuclear weapons. <u>This is not a new policy by any means, but the NPR surely clarifies it</u>: The “United States will not use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapons states that are party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and in compliance with their nuclear non-proliferation obligations.” Compare that to the Cold War version most recently repeated by the Bush administration in 2002: The United States “will not use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapon states parties to the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons [NPT], except in the case of an invasion or any other attack on the United States, its territories, its armed forces or other troops, its allies or on a state toward which it has a security commitment, carried out or sustained by such a non-nuclear weapon state in association or alliance with a nuclear weapon state.” Oy ve! There were so many exemptions buried in the old version that it was hard to understand what it meant. The new version fixes that: sign and abide by the NPT and you’re covered<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">! </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Yet as soon as you begin thinking about how this policy would be applied</span></u> <u>in the real world, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">questions arise. Take Iran</span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">,</span> for example, <u>a non-nuclear weapon state that has signed the NPT, but is not</u> – how to say it – <u>on the best terms with the regime. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">How much in breach of its obligations under the NPT does Iran have to be before the policy kicks in?</span></u> In other words, <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">at what point would the president decide to include or exclude Iran from the list of potential adversaries he orders the military to plan nuclear strikes against?</span></u> Likewise, <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">the negative security assurance only relates to Iran’s nuclear status</span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">. </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">But Iran is <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.fas.org/blog/ssp/2010/02/warplan.php" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">__already a target__</a> for U.S. nuclear planning</span></u> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">because of its</span></u> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">chemical and biological weapons</span> capabilities. And as the NPR makes clear, U.S. nuclear weapons continue to play a role in deterring chemical and biological weapons</u>. So could a country that has signed the NPT and abide by its obligations still be a target because it has chemical and biological weapons? In other words, which part of the policy rules? Reducing the Role of Nuclear Weapons? President <u>Obama <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Remarks-By-President-Barack-Obama-In-Prague-As-Delivered/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">__pledged__</a> in his Prague speech</u> last year <u>that he would “reduce the role of nuclear weapons”</u> to “put an end to Cold War thinking,” and <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.globalzero.org/en/opening-day-statement-global-zero-leaders" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reaffirmed</a> in February this year that the “Nuclear Posture Review will reduce [the] role….” <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">At a first glance the NPR appears to reduce the role of nuclear weapons</span></u>. The document states in the executive summary that, the “fundamental role of U.S. nuclear weapons is to deter nuclear attack on the United States, our allies, and partners.” (They’ll probably have to add “U.S. forces” to that list.) While most of the debate so far has focused on what “fundamental” means, I think the important part of that statement is the word “nuclear.” Because the two previous administrations used a broader role: to deter weapons of mass destruction attacks. Weapons of mass destruction (WMD) is a much broader category that includes nuclear, biological, chemical, and radiological weapons. Nuclear strike plans against regional adversaries armed with WMD were <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.fas.org/blog/ssp/2007/11/white_house_guidance_led_to_ne.php" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">added</a> to the strategic war plan in 2003. Under the section “Reducing the Role of U.S. Nuclear Weapons” the NPR lists three overall conclusions about the role: The United States will continue to strengthen conventional capabilities and reduce the role of nuclear weapons in deterring non-nuclear attack, with the objective of making deterrence of nuclear attack on the United States or our allies and partners the sole purpose of U.S. nuclear weapons. The United States would only consider the use of nuclear weapons in extreme circumstances to defense the vital interests of the United States or its allies and partners. The United States will not use of threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapons states that are party to the NPT and in compliance with their nuclear proliferation obligations. The “deter nuclear attack” and pursuit of “<u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">sole purpose</span></u>” is clearly new language, and they <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">would</span></u><u>, if implemented, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">constitute a roll-back of</span> the Clinton and <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Bush</span> administrations’ <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">policy</span></u> of using nuclear weapons to deter all forms of WMD. <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">But</span></u> <u>a little further into the document, it <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">soon becomes clear that the actual reduction in the nuclear mission</span></u> – at least for now – <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">is </span></u><u>rather <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">modest, if anything at all</span>.</u> In fact, <u>it’s difficult to see why <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">under the language used in this NPR, U.S. nuclear planning would</span> not <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">continue</span> pretty much <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">the way it is now</span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">. </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">The NPR explicitly rejects the adoption of</span></u> <u>a “<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">sole purpose” </span>policy</u> for now, and leaves it up to future presidents to possibly change the policy in that direction. The price for a “sole purpose” policy, it seems, is more conventional weapons.<br />

In principle, the Bush administration also sought to reduce U.S. reliance on nuclear weapons. Nevertheless, the <span style="color: black;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.dod.mil/execsec/adr2002/html_files/chap7.htm" rel="nofollow">2001 Nuclear Posture Review</a></span> found nuclear deterrence to be broadly applicable to a range of threats, including &quot;large-scale conventional military force.&quot; Moreover, the review, whose <span style="color: black;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/policy/dod/npr.htm" rel="nofollow">list of potential adversaries</a></span> included several without known nuclear arsenals, concluded that the &quot;unique properties&quot; of nuclear forces could enable the United States to &quot;hold at risk classes of targets important to achieve strategic and political objectives.&quot; This ambiguous formula was just as suggestive of coercion as of deterrence. The Bush administration also struggled to persuade other countries to follow its lead on nonproliferation, as evidenced by the failure of the 2005 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) Review Conference. This outcome wasn't entirely coincidental. </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">How America</span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">ns</span> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">conceive the role of nuclear weapons illuminates the role of nonproliferation in the eyes of a skeptical world</span></u>. <u>If Washington considers its nuclear arsenal suitable for coercing</u> <span style="color: black;">potential </span><u>adversaries, then stopping the spread of nuclear weapons becomes</u> <u>an adjunct</u> <span style="color: black;">to the already considerable power of the United States.</span> <strong><em><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">If</span></u></em></strong><span style="color: black;">, on the other hand,</span> <strong><em><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">nuclear weapons come to play a strictly defensive role</span> for the U</u></em></strong><span style="color: black;">nited</span> <strong><em><u>S</u></em></strong><span style="color: black;">tates and its allies,</span> <strong><em><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">then nonproliferation can be</span></u></em></strong> <span style="color: black;">more readily</span> <strong><em><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">appreciated</span></u></em></strong> <span style="color: black;">as</span> <strong><em><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">broadly</span></u></em></strong> <span style="color: black;">in the common interest of humanity. Given the prominence of the United </span>States in the international system, the role of U.S. nuclear weapons will strongly influence the Obama administration's chances of finding support for strengthened nonproliferation measures at the May 2010 NPT Review Conference in New York<span style="color: black;">.</span> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">If</span></u> <u>U.S. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">nuclear weapons are flaunted as instruments of coercion</span></u><span style="color: black;"> and emblems of might, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">then</span></u> <span style="color: black;">the states that have failed to observe the NPT's rules--</span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">North Korea and Iran--are likely to receive</span></u><span style="color: black;"> more </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">sympathy</span></u> <u>from the &quot;non-aligned&quot; camp</u><span style="color: black;"> than otherwise would be the case. </span><u>Their illicit activities will seem like natural responses to an overweening superpower that behaves as if it were a dissatisfied actor.</u> But <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">i<u>f</u></span> it is known that <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">U.S. nuclear weapons exist only for deterrence</span></u>, <u>then the U.S. case stands to receive the more understanding reception.</u> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Less is likely to be made of</span></u> the <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">failure</span></u> <span style="color: black;">of the recognized nuclear weapon</span> <u>states <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">to move rapidly toward disarm</span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">ament</span>. <span style="color: black;">As the de facto guarantor of security, prosperity, and the status quo across a globe-spanning network of alliances, the United States in particular could not be expected to drop its defenses while potential adversaries are seeking nuclear weapon capabilities of their own. The Obama administration's own Nuclear Posture Review, to be delivered before the NPT Review Conference, offers a timely opportunity to deliver on the president's promise to constrain the role of U.S. nuclear forces. The fulfillment of that pledge cannot rest too much on actual changes in force structure, since bureaucratic and political realities always weigh heavily upon formal review processes. (The inertia is compounded by the timing of U.S.-Russian nuclear diplomacy, which is currently focused on renewal of arms control mechanisms rather than seeking profound shifts in force posture.) Instead,</span> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">the administration can alter the role of nuclear weapons by issuing a clear and authoritative definition of their purposes</span></u><span style="color: black;">. </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">We shouldn't consider this step merely a matter of &quot;declaratory policy</span></u></strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; color: black;">,&quot;</span><span style="color: black;"> as if it were solely for external consumption; rather, </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">it should be taken as </span></u></strong><strong><u>a basic choice of <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">defense policy, the point of departure for future guidance to planners</span></u></strong><span style="color: black;">. </span>Naturally<span style="color: black;">,</span> <u>the most straightforward expression of <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">a defensive policy</span></u>--<u>pure deterrence,</u> with no element of coercion--<u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">would be</span></u> &quot;no-first-use&quot; guidance,<u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; color: black;"> deciding that nuclear weapons are only to be used in response to nuclear attack</span></u> <span style="color: black;">against the United States, its allies, or its forward-deployed forces. The United States refrained from making no-first-use pledges during the Cold War because of the need to counteract Soviet conventional superiority. Subsequently, it adopted a policy of &quot;calculated ambiguity,&quot; explained by the need to deter chemical or biological attacks with nuclear weapons. Despite the implausibility of such a disproportionate retaliatory threat, this concern remains the primary obstacle to a nuclear no-first-use policy. Even so, it does not prevent a deterrence-only policy. If the Obama administration determines that conventional forces and defensive systems suffice to deter or neutralize chemical or biological attack, then it can readily adopt a nuclear no-first-use policy. Or, if the administration determines that nuclear weapons should continue to play a role in deterring chemical or biological attack--notwithstanding their lack of credibility for this purpose--then it can take the advocates of calculated ambiguity at their word, establishing a policy of no first use of weapons of mass destruction.</span> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">The</span></u> appropriate <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">statement could be issued as an Executive Order, giving it the force of policy</span></u>. Either nuclear no-first-use or the second-best alternative will face opposition from advocates of traditionalism in nuclear strategy, which prizes flexibility over all other considerations. But neither idea would face insurmountable obstacles. Certainly, <strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">if the role of nuclear weapons cannot be constrained</span></u></strong> by issuing an authoritative policy statement, <strong><u>then</u></strong> seemingly <strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">very little can be achieved</span></u></strong> in this area at all.<br />

WASHINGTON -- <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">The greatest contribution</span></u> the <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Obama</span></u> administration's forthcoming review of U.S. nuclear strategy <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">could make to nonprolif</span></u>eration<u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;"> is to establish a doctrine that pledges to use such weapons only against atomic threats</span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">,</span> a leading disarmament advocate said last week (see GSN, Jan. 19). (Jan. 25) - A nuclear-capable U.S. Minuteman 3 ICBM lifts off during an exercise. A forthcoming U.S. nuclear strategy review should rule out the use of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear threats, a leading proponent of disarmament said last week (U.S. Air Force photo). The Pentagon-led Nuclear Posture Review, expected to be released in March, is to establish policies for the U.S. nuclear deterrent over the next five to 10 years. <u>It should make a &quot;strong statement about nuclear policy which can assure the world that we're</u> still <u>not</u> in the position of <u>planning to use nuclear weapons</u>, particularly in a pre-emptive manner; an impression that had been left in the world in the last decade or so,&quot; <u>said former Defense Secretary</u> William <u>Perry.</u> The highly anticipated review should also &quot;endorse unambiguously&quot; the sweeping nonproliferation goals U.S. President Barack Obama laid out in his 2009 speech in Prague and be &quot;explicit about concrete steps&quot; toward achieving those milestones, Perry said Friday during the U.S. rollout of the report from the International Commission on Nuclear Nonproliferation and Disarmament. The administration of Obama's predecessor, President George W. Bush defined U.S. nuclear doctrine as reserving the right to respond by any means, including nuclear strike, to attacks made against the country. The study includes 76 policy recommendations for world leaders to follow as they work toward a world free of nuclear weapons. It was issued last month in hopes of helping to guide deliberations at the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty review conference, scheduled for May in New York. The document suggests a worldwide nuclear arms rollback to 2,000 weapons, or about 10 percent of today's stockpile, by 2025. It urges countries with nuclear weapons to refine their nuclear doctrines to limit the role of nuclear weapons and provide assurances that they would not consider a nuclear strike against any nation that does not possess such weapons. The United States should &quot;at the very least accept the principle that the 'sole purpose' of possessing nuclear weapons is to deter others from using such weapons&quot; against it and its allies, the study states. <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Embracing that position would &quot;be a <strong><em>significant contribution</em>&quot; to</strong> <strong>reducing the role of nuclear weapons</strong></span></u> in U.S. national security strategy <strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">and place <em>&quot;very strong pressure</em> on the other nuclear-armed states to change their own position</span></u></strong> in a more forthcoming way,&quot; according to the report. &quot;The Prague speech just stated, of course, that it was the U.S. objective ... to reduce the salience of the role of nuclear weapons but it wasn't really spelled out in any more detail than that, whereas all the other elements of the Prague speech have since then have largely been operationalized,&quot; said Gareth Evans, co-chairman of the commission. He did not provide specific examples. &quot;To the extent that <u>the world is waiting</u> for the NPR is very much <u>to see what is happening on the doctrine front</u>,&quot; Evans added. <u>Perry argued that nonprolif</u>eration <u>and disarm</u>ament <u>efforts have</u> &quot;stalled or even <u>reversed&quot; in the last decade, noting that Russia and China</u> today <u>are</u> said to be <u>building new nuclear weapons</u>. &quot;North Korea has gone nuclear and Iran is following close in its footsteps,&quot; according to Perry. If those countries develop their own arsenals &quot;I believe we will cross over a nuclear tipping point, greatly increasing the danger of a nuclear catastrophe in the world,&quot; he said. &quot;We must do everything in our power to prevent that from happening,&quot; Perry added. He and former Senator Sam Nunn and former Secretaries of State Henry Kissinger and George Shultz are sometimes called the &quot;Four Horsemen of the Non-Apocalypse&quot; for their key role in promoting revived discussion of nuclear disarmament. Evans said nuclear doctrine was a &quot;lively issue&quot; for debate among commission members because &quot;there's still a constituency&quot; for extended deterrence -- possible use of a nuclear-strategic response in the event of a nuclear attack on the territory or troops of an ally. There are also advocates for keeping open the possibility of using nuclear weapons to deal with non-nuclear contingencies, including &quot;particularly extreme ones&quot; that could stem from biological weapons development. However, the commission's &quot;very strong view was that <strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">we</span></u></strong> just simply <u><strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">can't make <em>serious progress</em></span></strong></u> toward disarmament <strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">without</span></u></strong> at the threshold <u><strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">making <em>absolutely clear</em> that nuclear weapons' role in salience must be reduced</span></strong></u> in this way <strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">and <em>only kept available for nuclear threat contingencies</em></span></u></strong><strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">,</span></strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">&quot;</span> he told the audience. The counterargument is that allies would be less protected by a security umbrella employing only conventional forces, Evans acknowledged. Still, he argued, the capability of the United States and others is &quot;amply sufficient to deal with any other contingency that's remotely foreseeable for the future.&quot; He did not specify what those contingencies might include. A declaration on the nuclear doctrine within the U.S. review would increase the chances to achieve agreements on nonproliferation and disarmament at the conference itself, as well as future talks at the U.N. Security Council and the International Atomic Energy Agency, he said. Discussions on <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">nonprolif</span></u>eration <u>and disarm</u>ament &quot;<u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">require multilateral buy-in</span>&quot;</u> from other countries <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">and a</span></u> &quot;big, big, <strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">stumbling block</span></u></strong> to getting that buy-in in the past <strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">has been the perception that the big guys are just not serious</span></u></strong> when it comes to disarmament,&quot; Evans said. &quot;So <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">for the U.S. to demonstrate seriousness</span></u> in the way that would be involved in the NPR movement <u>on this doctrine issue</u> in a way that we've <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">described <u>would be</u> ... <u>hugely important</u>.&quot;</span> &quot;That's the view we've been stating with some vigor to the U.S. administration in recent months,&quot; he added. A Pentagon spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment by deadline. &quot;<u>It's hard to see where&quot; the</u> policy <u>discussion</u> <u>within the Obama administration</u> about adopting the sole purpose position <u>will land</u>, according to Hans Kristensen, director of the Federation of American Scientists Nuclear Information Project. <u>The debate</u> raging between policy-makers -- with the U.S. National Security Council and the State and Defense departments on one side and U.S. Strategic Command on the other -- <u>is one of the reasons the</u> all-encompassing <u>review has been delayed</u> until March, he said. <u>Strategic Command believes making a declaration would be a mistake</u> and allow countries to seek biological and chemical weapons without fear of the U.S. nuclear deterrent, Kristensen told Global Security Newswire . The other side has argued that such countries are smaller and highly vulnerable to conventional capabilities, he added. &quot;<strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">It's hard to see how the administration would be <em>able to illustrate it has reduced the role</em> of nuclear weapons</span></u></strong> in national security strategy <strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">without adopting such a policy</span></u></strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">,&quot;</span> according to Kristensen.<br />

<em><span style="color: black;">However, I would argue that</span> <u><span style="color: black;">before the U</span></u><span style="color: black;">nited</span> <u><span style="color: black;">S</span></u><span style="color: black;">tates (or any other country)</span> <u><span style="color: black;">gives up on the NPT</span></u> <span style="color: black;">and associated nuclear nonproliferation regime,</span> <u><span style="color: black;">we should take full account of</span></u> <span style="color: black;">not only</span> <u><span style="color: black;">the regime's</span></u> <span style="color: black;">failures, but also its</span> <u><span style="color: black;">successes</span></u><span style="color: black;">. Indeed, the success of the NPT is in many ways more surprising than its recent failures: </span><u><span style="color: black;">for almost four decades, almost all states in the international system chose to forgo nuclear weapons, and in some cases, even gave them up</span></u><span style="color: black;">. </span><u><span style="color: black;">Numerous reports in the</span></u> <span style="color: black;">19</span><u><span style="color: black;">60s</span></u> <u><span style="color: black;">warned that the number of new nuclear states could reach </span></u><span style="color: black;">as high as</span><u><span style="color: black;"> 20</span></u> <span style="color: black;">in a few decades (The Bomb 1965:53).</span> <u><span style="color: black;">Instead, the count </span></u><span style="color: black;">by 2008</span> <u><span style="color: black;">is only four</span></u><span style="color: black;">: India, Pakistan, Israel, and North Korea. 2 The fact that so many states abstained from nuclear weapons tells us to look closely at the nuclear nonproliferation regime. What role has it played in encouraging nuclear forbearance? </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; color: black;">With </span></u><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; color: black;">the risk of nuclear theft or accidents increasing with each new nuclear weapons state</span></u></strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; color: black;">, the international community needs all the help it can get in discouraging nuclear prolif</span></u><u><span style="color: black;">eration</span></u><span style="color: black;">. </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; color: black;">This is especially important given</span></u><u><span style="color: black;"> the growing numbers of &quot;<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">latent nuclear states</span>,&quot; those <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">with the &quot;necessary</span> industrial <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">infrastructure and</span> scientific <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">expertise to </span></span></u><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; color: black;">build</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="color: black;"> nuclear <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">weapons on a crash basis</span></span></u></strong> <span style="color: black;">if they chose to do so&quot; (Sagan 1996:56). In 2004, the International Atomic Energy Agency (</span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; color: black;">IAEA) estimated that </span></u><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; color: black;">over 40 countries</span></u></strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; color: black;"> were &quot;nuclear latent</span></u> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; color: black;">states</span></u><span style="color: black;">&quot;. Given the high stakes, we need to better understand how and in what ways the NPT has actually helped discouraged nuclear proliferation. In doing so, we can also understand the mechanisms through which international regimes work to influence policymakers. So what about </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; color: black;">the NPT</span></u></strong><span style="color: black;">—if anything—</span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; color: black;">has</span></u></strong> <span style="color: black;">led to such <strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">a stunning record of nonprolif</span>eration</u></strong>? Certainly, a number of authors have tackled the topic of how the NPT contributes to halting nonproliferation. What tends to be missing, however, is a systematic and theoretically grounded way to assess the NPT's utility. In this article, I propose such a framework, drawing from social psychology. Within the social psychology literature, scholars agree that persuasion and influence happen through distinct, recognizable mechanisms. I argue that </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; color: black;">the</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; color: black;"> influence of the </span></u></strong><span style="color: black;">nuclear nonproliferation</span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; color: black;"> regime </span></u></strong><span style="color: black;">of state elites</span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; color: black;"> could be understood through the lens of social psychology</span></u></strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; color: black;">.</span><span style="color: black;"> 3 In other words, I propose taking social psychology's framework for how attitudes and behavior change, and applying it to the NPT. I do so through a three-step process. </span><strong><u><span style="color: black;">I</span></u></strong><span style="color: black;"> first </span><strong><u><span style="color: black;">break apart </span></u></strong><span style="color: black;">&quot;nuclear forbearance&quot; (or </span><strong><u><span style="color: black;">compliance with the NPT</span></u></strong><span style="color: black;">) </span><strong><u><span style="color: black;">into three different outcomes</span></u></strong><span style="color: black;"> identified by the social psychology literature: </span><strong><u><span style="color: black;">persuasion</span></u></strong><span style="color: black;"> (behavior resulting from genuine transformation of preferences), </span><strong><u><span style="color: black;">social conformity</span></u></strong><span style="color: black;"> (behavior resulting from the desire to maximize social benefits and/or minimize social costs, without a change in underlying preferences), </span><strong><u><span style="color: black;">and </span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="color: black;">identification</span></u></strong><span style="color: black;"> (behavior resulting from the desire or habit of following the actions of an important other). Next, I investigate the different mechanisms through which the international social environment exerts influence on policymakers: creating a &quot;list&quot; effect in which those in noncompliance are obviously in a small minority, linking nuclear nonproliferation to other strongly held values, establishing a public record of state commitment which makes it hard for a state to withdraw, and more. Finally, I assess the utility of the framework by examining the case of Japan: to what extent does it help us understand Japanese nuclear decision-making? I conclude with some thoughts on how this framework could be applied in a number of different issue areas in international relations. Because the framework is drawn from social psychology, it should be applicable to more than just nuclear proliferation. To what extent is it useful to understand compliance with international regimes as three different outcomes (persuasion, identification, and conformity)? Do the mechanisms work in other issues areas? Are some mechanisms more potent in specific issue areas, or perhaps in different types of regimes (for example, regimes formalized through treaties, informal regimes, track-two diplomacy, etc.)? While my immediate focus is how this framework helps us to understand nuclear proliferation and nonproliferation, it could provide fertile ground for research across a number of different fields. Almost all states have both ratified and adhered to the NPT, giving up nuclear weapons and exercising &quot;nuclear forbearance.&quot;</span> <strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; color: black;">One may think that</span></u></strong><span style="color: black;"> this nuclear forbearance means these states have permanently given up the nuclear option, and </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; color: black;">if the NPT is weakened</span></u></strong><span style="color: black;">, these </span>states'<strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; color: black;"> nuclear decision-making would not change</span></u></strong><span style="color: black;">. That would be the case if these states were &quot;persuaded&quot;—that is, they have internalized the message of the NPT and no longer need the treaty to exist for them to adhere to its precepts. </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; color: black;">However</span></u></strong><span style="color: black;">, this outcome of &quot;</span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; color: black;">persuasion&quot; is not the only type of nuclear forbearance</span></u></strong> <span style="color: black;">possible. It could be that <u>the elite are forgoing nuclear weapons due to &quot;<strong>conformity</strong></u>&quot;—to gain social prestige and/or avoid social costs. In this case, <strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">if the NPT collapsed, the social costs and benefits associated with it may no longer exist</span></u></strong><u>,</u> potentially </span><strong><u><span style="color: black;">leading to a reassessment of a state's nuclear posture</span></u></strong><span style="color: black;">. Or, <strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">leadership could</span></u></strong> be</span><u><span style="color: black;"> <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">follow</span></strong></span></u><span style="color: black;">ing <strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">the lead</span></u></strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;"> <strong>of an important &quot;other</strong></span></u>&quot;—the outcome of identification. <strong><u>If the important &quot;other&quot; helped to weaken the NPT, then leadership may no longer be as concerned about adhering to the treaty</u></strong>. While the behavioral outcome is currently the same—nuclear forbearance—the attitude and motivation behind the behavior is not. This unpacking of nuclear forbearance is based on social psychology. Alastair Iain Johnston (2001) has taken the field considerably forward by his identification from the social psychology literature of two methods of behavior change: persuasion and social influence. Johnston argues that <u>in addition to</u> transformation of state interests (<u>persuasion), <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">multilateral institutions can</span></u> also <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">exert</span></u>, or provide a forum through which members exert, &quot;<u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">social influence</span></u>&quot;—essentially, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; color: black;">a</span></u><u><span style="color: black;"> social <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">version o</span>f </span></u><span style="color: black;">material </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; color: black;">carrot-stick factors that states include in cost-benefit calculations</span></u><span style="color: black;">. Roughly, &quot;persuasion&quot; can be characterized as &quot;I now see that X is better than Y&quot; and &quot;<u>social influence&quot; can be characterized as</u> &quot;I think Y is correct (or </span><u><span style="color: black;">I like Y better</span></u><span style="color: black;">), </span><u><span style="color: black;">but since everyone else says X, I will do X so I don't rock the boat</span></u><span style="color: black;">&quot; (Johnston 2001). Social rewards for conformance with institutional norms include backpatting; for nonconformance, shaming. Social influence, then, is a cost-benefit calculation made with social factors, whereas persuasion is true preference change (Kelman 1958). This is an important point: constructivists often construe the effect of multilateral institutions as that of changing a state's conception of its national interest. While that is an important effect to investigate, it is also crucial to recognize that this is not the only &quot;nonmaterial&quot; way through which states' behavior may change. In other words, it does not have to be all-or-nothing: either states transform their attitudes and behavior (validating constructivism) or they don't (validating realism). Constructivism allows us to explore ways in which the social milieu created by regimes can influence state behavior without &quot;converting&quot; them. Social conformity is one conceptualization of this influence short of conversion. Another example is the cooperative process documented by Dalia Dassa Kaye (2001) in her study of the Middle East peace process, which she shows to help states gain common understandings without necessarily wholesale transformation of state preferences. Distinguishing between full-fledged persuasion and social conformity is critical to nuclear policymaking. As Ariel Levite (2002) argues, <strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">some states that have adhered to the NPT may</span> actually <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">be engaged in &quot;nuclear hedging</span></u></strong>&quot;—that is, not actively engaging in nuclear weapons development but <u>maintaining capacity to develop them quickly if desired. On the surface, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">what looks like NPT compliance</span> and what seems to indicate persuasion <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">may</span> better <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">be described as social conformity</span></u>.</span></em><br />
<em><span style="color: black; margin: 3pt 0in;">This paper argues, however, that our model of persuasion and influence needs to be more detailed to provide a robust guide in our exploration. First, instead of the term &quot;social influence,&quot; I propose the use of &quot;<u>social conformity</u>&quot; to <u>signal outward acceptance with private rejection</u>, because in social psychology literature, this is the terminology most often used. Beyond this terminology issue, I argue that, in addition to persuasion and social conformity, <u>we must also include &quot;identification&quot; as a method of behavioral change</u>. <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Identification takes place when an actor wants to be like another</span>, and so changes</u> his or her <u>actions to mimic those they admire</u>. It can take place when a friend agrees with another friend, not because he has really changed his mind, but because it is important to a significant other. Herbert Kelman (1958:51) defines identification in this way:</span></em><br />
<em><span style="color: black;">Identification can be said to occur when an individual accepts influence because he wants to establish or maintain a satisfying self-defining relationship to another person or group. This relationship may take the form of classical identification, in which the individual takes over the role of the other, or it may take the form of a reciprocal role relationship. The individual actually believes in the responses which he adopts through identification, but their specific content is more or less irrelevant. He adopts the induced behavior because it is associated with the desired relationship.</span></em><br />
<em><span style="color: black;">Identification falls between outright persuasion (where preferences have changed) and social conformity (where preferences have not changed). In fact, while <u>identification</u> can be an influence outcome between individuals, it</span> <u><span style="color: black;">is a common result from group membership</span></u><span style="color: black;">. Called &quot;ingroup identification,&quot; Marilynn Brewer and R. J. Brown (1998:561) note that &quot;</span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; color: black;">when a collection of individuals believe that they share a common</span></u> <span style="color: black;">in-group </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; color: black;">membership, they are more likely to act in the interest of collective welfare</span></u> <span style="color: black;">than are individuals in the same situation who do not have a sense of group identity.&quot; In contrast to social conformity (which is strategic and motivated by straightforward utility maximization), identification is based on an affective desire to create, maintain, or strengthen a relationship.</span></em><br />
<em><span style="color: black;">Why is it important to include identification as a third method of behavioral change? After all, models are theoretical constructs that help us understand reality, not chart it out in full detail. However, mechanisms that produce original policy results should be included in models. That is, if the behavior change mechanism of identification leads to different policy results than persuasion and social influence, then it should be included. A current example from the nonproliferation arena will illustrate. Over the past decade, the United States has backed away from some of its obligations in the nonproliferation regime: a continued push for new nuclear weapons, public declaration of the decision to continue designing and computer-testing new nuclear weapons, and a decision to employ a limited ballistic missile defense system. Some also argue that the Bush administration's proposed nuclear agreement with India undermines the basis of the NPT by encouraging nuclear trade with a state that refuses to sign the NPT.</span></em><br />
<em><span style="color: black;">If an ally of the United States' (call this state Ally X) had initially followed the United States lead on nuclear nonproliferation due to persuasion, Ally X would remain persuaded, and thus would likely express disappointment, as well as encourage the United States to get back on course. If, however, another ally's behavior was based on identification with the United States (call this state Ally Y), then which United States would it identify with: the United States of action or rhetoric? Identification is also important because even if the United States works to uphold the nonproliferation regime, the fact that Washington maintains nearly 10,000 nuclear weapons—and almost 60% of them are operational—may send the message that to be powerful, a country needs nuclear armaments (United States Profile 2007).</span></em><br />
<em><span style="margin: 3pt 0in;"><span style="color: black;">In addition, <u>because</u> in reality <u>states are not unitary actors</u>, the distinctions between persuasion, <u>conformity and identification likely play out in domestic politics</u>. In fact, each of the influence outcomes could be represented by some segment of society interested in nuclear policy. One example would be nongovernmental organization </span><strong>(</strong><u><span style="color: black;">NGOs</span></u><span style="color: black;">) and activists <u>are &quot;persuaded&quot;</u> that nuclear weapons are detrimental to state prestige and identity, <u>policy wonks in the diplomatic core &quot;identify&quot; with their Western allies, and members of the military bow to &quot;social conformity</u>.&quot; In each case</span><strong>,</strong> <u><span style="color: black;">the behavior is the same</span></u><span style="color: black;">: nuclear forbearance. <u>The reasons behind the actions are different</u>, however, <u>and material or social changes could lead to behavioral changes</u>. A short narrative of how different domestic factions might play out in Ally X and Ally Y will illustrate. This description is not meant to describe any two countries, but rather simply highlight what differently influenced groups might look like with regard to nuclear policy, and how they might react to US behavior.</span></span></em><br />
<em><span style="color: black; margin: 3pt 0in;">In the case of Ally X and Ally Y (both confronted by the US's changing behavior with regard to the nuclear nonproliferation regime), Ally X's nuclear policy could be supported by a coalition of civil servants in a bureaucracy that has supported the NPT for many years, political appointees who believe in nonproliferation, and antinuclear activists with embedded ties to the policymaking apparatus—all of whom are &quot;persuaded.&quot; <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">The U</span></u>nited <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">S</span></u>tates<u>'</u> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">current actions</span></u> probably would <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">inspire</span> disappointment, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">resentment</span>, disgust</u>—but a change of heart is not likely because these actors are genuinely persuaded of the merits of nonproliferation. However, other elements in that government and state—<u>those who support nonproliferation because of identification or social conformity</u>—will likely have a different reaction. Those who believe their state should forgo nuclear weapons due to the negative diplomatic effects any other position would have, <u>might rethink their position in light of the US's stance</u>, as well as the ineffectual response to North Korea's nuclear test in October 2006. In the short run, it is not likely that the state's behavior would change, but <u>in the long run, those persuaded may change their minds or may lose ground to growing ranks of those who disagree.</u></span></em><br />
<em><span style="color: black;">In the case of Ally Y, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; color: black;">where nuclear policy is guided by identification</span></u><u><span style="color: black;"> with the U</span></u><span style="color: black;">nited </span><u><span style="color: black;">S</span></u><span style="color: black;">tates, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; color: black;">confusion is likely</span></u><span style="color: black;"> to result, based on gap between US rhetoric and actions.

<em><span style="color: black;">Metric: Does NPT adherence provide a leverage point for outside influence and action to prevent proliferation?</span></em><br />
<em><u><span style="color: black;">NPT adherence clearly provides a point of leverage</span></u><span style="color: black;">, although the nature of that leverage - and its likely effectiveness - could vary depending on the country. In Iran’s case, its adherence to</span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; color: black;"> t</span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; color: black;">he NPT has been</span></u><u><span style="color: black;"> most useful as <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">a rallying point</span> for outside efforts <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">to pressure</span></span></u> <span style="color: black;">Iranian</span> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; color: black;">leaders to think anew about their goals</span></u><span style="color: black;">. UN Security Council Resolutions 1737 (2006), 1747 (2007), 1803 (2008), and 1835 (2008) all reaffirmed the council’s support for the NPT, while Resolutions 1747 and 1803 both emphasized ‘‘the need for all States Parties to that Treaty to comply fully with all their obligations.’’ Moreover, some key European countries’ support for actions to stop Iran’s uranium enrichment activities has been linked to a belief*accurate or not*that Iranian acquisition of nuclear weapons would put at risk the overall NPT structure.19 Amid continuing tensions between the George W. Bush administration and other countries, Iran’s NPT obligations provided a ready basis to argue that the issue was not simply one of the United States versus Iran. To use a hypothetical example,</span> <u><span style="color: black;">let us imagine that</span></u> <span style="color: black;">due to some combination of the most recent North Korean volte-face on giving up its nuclear weapons, tensions with China, and uncertainty about the U.S. security link,</span> <u><span style="color: black;">pressures grow</span></u><span style="color: black;"> in Japan </span><u><span style="color: black;">to pursue nuclear weapons</span></u><span style="color: black;">. In this case,</span> <strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; color: black;">outside powers could use</span></u></strong> <span style="color: black;">Japan’s</span> <strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; color: black;">NPT adherence as a leverage point to urge the</span></u></strong><span style="color: black;"> Japanese </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; color: black;">leadership to think carefully about whether to take that step</span></u></strong><span style="color: black;">. Japan’s</span> <u><span style="color: black;">NPT adherence</span></u> <span style="color: black;">- and the need for it to go through procedures to withdraw from the NPT -</span> <u><span style="color: black;">would also help buy time for new initiatives to deal with</span></u> <span style="color: black;">future Japanese</span> <u><span style="color: black;">security concerns</span></u><span style="color: black;">.</span></em><br />
<em><span style="color: black;">Still another example of the leverage provided by NPT membership concerns possible action to be taken after a country has violated its obligations and broken out of the NPT. Iran may yet be a future case in point. Should Iran acquire nuclear weapons, the international community will need to take many actions to contain the regional and global spillovers.20 Those actions could well include measures to make Iran pay a price for violating the NPT - to signal resolve to Iran, to its threatened neighbors, and to the wider NPT community. The fact that Iran would have violated its legal obligations under the NPT would provide a stronger foundation for any such international punitive actions. </span></em><br />
<em><span style="color: black;">Metric: Did widespread</span> <u><span style="color: black;">NPT adherence</span></u> <span style="color: black;">help </span><u><span style="color: black;">reverse the perception that runaway proliferation was unavoidable</span></u><span style="color: black;">?</span></em><br />
<em><span style="color: black; margin: 3pt 0in;">In the early 1960s, there was a growing fear that widespread proliferation of nuclear weapons was possibly unavoidable. President John F. Kennedy warned in 1963 that a world with many dozens of nuclear weapon states might emerge. This fear of runaway proliferation gave urgency to the negotiation of a nonproliferation treaty, not least because of the belief that growing worldwide use of nuclear power would place access to nuclear weapons material in the hands of many countries.21 Such <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">warnings of runaway proliferation</span></u>, however, <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">could</span> well</u> have <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">become a self-fulfilling prophecy</span></u><strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">. <u>Fearful of a world of nuclear powers, many countries</u> <u>might have sought nuclear weapons lest they be left behind</u></span>.</strong></span></em><br />
<em><u><span style="color: black;">Responding to such fears, the U</span></u><span style="color: black;">nited </span><u><span style="color: black;">S</span></u><span style="color: black;">tates </span><u><span style="color: black;">took </span></u><span style="color: black;">actions to enhance the nuclear security of its European non-nuclear allies. In parallel, the United States, the Soviet Union, and many other countries joined together</span> <u><span style="color: black;">to create </span></u><span style="color: black;">what became</span> <u><span style="color: black;">the nonproliferation regime</span></u><span style="color: black;">. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">T</span></span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; color: black;">he NPT</span></u> <span style="color: black;">was and</span> <u><span style="color: black;">remains a key part of that regime</span></u><span style="color: black;">. Steadily growing</span> <u><span style="color: black;">membership in the NPT</span></u> <span style="color: black;">after its opening for signature in 1968 - including critical countries in Europe and Asia -</span> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; color: black;">provide</span></u><span style="color: black;">d </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; color: black;">a </span></u><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; color: black;">valuable symbol</span></u></strong> <u><span style="color: black;">that demonstrate</span></u><span style="color: black;">d to many countries</span> <u><span style="color: black;">that runaway proliferation was not the wave of the future</span></u><span style="color: black;">. So did the prospect of an international system of nuclear safeguards - run by a then-new International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) - to prevent diversion of nuclear weapon materials from peaceful nuclear uses. In effect, partly </span><u><span style="color: black;">because of</span></u><span style="color: black;"> more traditional security mechanisms and partly due to the growing</span> <strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; color: black;">NPT</span></u></strong> <strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; color: black;">membership</span></u></strong><span style="color: black;">, early</span> <strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; color: black;">fears of</span></u></strong> <span style="color: black;">a world</span><strong><u><span style="color: black;"> of <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">runaway</span> global <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">prolif</span>eration <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">became a self-denying prophecy</span></span></u></strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; color: black;">.</span></em><br />
<em><span style="color: black;">Today,</span> <u><span style="color: black;">fears have </span></u><span style="color: black;">again </span><u><span style="color: black;">emerged that runaway proliferation could develop</span></u><span style="color: black;">. It is often argued that</span> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; color: black;">the spread of nuclear weapons is at a </span></u><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; color: black;">‘‘tipping point</span></u></strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; color: black;">,’’</span></u> <span style="color: black;">that</span> <u><span style="color: black;">there is a danger of ‘‘</span></u><strong><u><span style="color: black;">cascading’’ proliferation</span></u></strong><span style="color: black;">, and that we could be entering a ‘‘new nuclear age.’’22 In this context, however, widespread adherence to the NPT alone will not suffice to counter fears of nuclear weapon proliferation. Rather,</span> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; color: black;">the NPT’s contribution to countering fears</span></u><u><span style="color: black;"> of runaway proliferation <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">will depend heavily on</span> </span></u><span style="color: black;">whether there is</span> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; color: black;">a</span></u> <span style="color: black;">widespread </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; color: black;">perception that countries are </span></u><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; color: black;">complying</span></u></strong> <span style="color: black;">fully </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; color: black;">with their NPT obligations</span></u></strong><span style="color: black;">.</span></em><br />
<em><span style="color: black;">Article II Net Assessment. The direct impact of Article II in preventing proliferation is mixed. Negotiation of the NPT with its ‘‘no manufacture, no acquisition’’ obligation forced a number of countries to decide whether or not to pursue nuclear weapons. Faced with that decision, important countries chose to renounce nuclear weapons. In deciding, states were motivated by a mix of considerations, and the NPT helped crystallize their decisions. By contrast, some prominent NPT parties have stayed in the NPT while pursuing nuclear weapons: North Korea, Iraq, and Libya - and quite possibly Iran.</span></em><br />
<em><span style="color: black;">The indirect impact of Article II may be more compelling. The ‘‘no acquisition, no manufacture’’ obligation provides a nonproliferation leverage point for rallying outsiders, for engaging in dialogue with countries rethinking their nonproliferation commitment, and for taking action after NPT breakout. Successful negotiation of the</span> <strong><u><span style="color: black;">NPT</span></u></strong> <span style="color: black;">and Article II</span> <strong><u><span style="color: black;">contribute</span></u></strong><span style="color: black;">d </span><strong><u><span style="color: black;">significantly to reversing</span></u></strong> <span style="color: black;">earlier </span><strong><u><span style="color: black;">fears of runaway worldwide proliferation</span></u></strong><span style="color: black;">.

 <em><span class="7TimesNewRoman">Learning to Leverage?</span></em><br />
<br />
<em><span class="7TimesNewRoman">When a new state acquires nuclear weapons, how does it influence the way the state behaves and how might that change over time?

<em><span class="7TimesNewRoman">This section focuses on how acquiring nuclear weapons influences both the new nuclear state and potential adversaries.

Coming from a slightly different perspective, uncertainty about the consequences of proliferation on the balance of power and the behavior of new nuclear states on the part of their potential adversaries could also shape behavior in similar ways (Schelling 1966; Blainey 1988).

<em><span style="color: black;">Nuclear winter is a term that describes the climatic effects of nuclear war.</span> <u>In the</u> <span style="color: black;">19</span><u>80's</u>, <span style="color: black;">work conducted jointly by</span> <u>Western and Soviet scientists showed that</u> <span style="color: black;">for a full-scale nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union the climatic consequences, and indirect effects of the collapse of society, would be so severe that the ensuing</span> <u>nuclear winter would produce <strong>famine for billions</strong></u> <span style="color: black;">of people far from the target zones. There are several wrong impressions that people have about nuclear winter. One is that there was a flaw in the theory and that the large climatic effects were disproven. Another is that the problem, even if it existed, has been solved by the end of the nuclear arms race. But these are both wrong. Furthermore,</span> <u>new nuclear states threaten global climate change even with arsenals that are much less than 1% of the current global arsenal</u>. <a name="What.27s_New"></a><span style="color: black;">What's New </span><u>Based on new work</u> <span style="color: black;">published in 2007 and 2008</span> <u>by some of the pioneers of nuclear winter research</u> <span style="color: black;">who worked on the original studies,</span> <u>we now can say</u> <span style="color: black;">several things about this topic. New Science: </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">A minor nuclear war</span></u></strong> <span style="color: black;">(such as between India and Pakistan or in the Middle East), with each country using 50 Hiroshima-sized atom bombs as airbursts on urban areas,</span> <strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">could produce</span></u></strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;"> <strong>climate change unprecedented in recorded human history</strong></span></u>. <span style="color: black;">This is only 0.03% of the explosive power of the current global arsenal. </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">This</span></u> <span style="color: black;">same scenario</span> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">would produce </span></u></em><u><strong>global ozone depletion</strong></u> <em><span style="color: black;">, because the heating of the stratosphere would enhance the chemical reactions that destroy ozone.

A nuclear explosion is like bringing a piece of the Sun to the Earth's surface for a fraction of a second. Like a giant match, it causes cities and industrial areas to burn. Megacities have developed in India and Pakistan and other developing countries, providing tremendous amounts of fuel for potential fires. The direct effects of the nuclear weapons, blast, radioactivity, fires, and extensive pollution, would kill millions of people, but only those near the targets. However, the fires would have another effect. The massive amounts of dark smoke from the fires would be lofted into the upper troposphere, 10-15 kilometers (6-9 miles) above the Earth's surface, and then absorption of sunlight would further heat the smoke, lifting it into the stratosphere, a layer where the smoke would persist for years, with no rain to wash it out. The climatic effects of smoke from fires started by nuclear war depend on the amount of smoke. Our new calculations show that for 50 nuclear weapons dropped on two countries, on the targets that would produce the maximum amount of smoke, about 5 megatons (Tg) of black smoke would be produced, accounting for the amount emitted from the fires and the amount immediately washed out in rain. As the smoke is lofted into the stratosphere, it would be transported around the world by the prevailing winds. We also did calculations for two scenarios of war between the two superpowers who still maintain large nuclear arsenals, the United States and Russia. In one scenario, 50 Tg of black smoke would be produced and in another, 150 Tg of black smoke would be produced. How many nuclear weapons would be required to produce this much smoke? It depends on the targets, but there are enough weapons in the current arsenals to produce either amount. In fact, there are only so many targets. Once they are all hit by weapons, additional weapons would not produce much more smoke at all. Even after the current nuclear weapons reduction treaty between these superpowers is played out in 2012, with each having about 2,000 weapons, 150 Tg of smoke could still be produced. Here are movies of the smoke transport from three different scenarios: </span><u>These new results were made possible by the use of a <strong>state-of-the-art general circulation model of the climate</strong></u>. <u>For the first time a complete calculation of not only atmospheric but also oceanic circulation was conducted</u>,<span style="color: black;"> including the entire atmosphere from the surface up through the troposphere, stratosphere, and mesosphere, to an elevation of 80 kilometers (50 miles). </span><u>Previous calculations</u><span style="color: black;"> had not been run for the 10 year simulations here, and </span><u>had not allowed the smoke to be lofted into the upper stratosphere</u><span style="color: black;">, where it would persist for many years. We calculated the climate response to the three scenarios illustrated above. Compared to the global warming observed for the past century, all three scenarios show massive cooling. Compared to the climate change for the Northern Hemisphere for the past 1,000 years, the famous hockey stick diagram, the climate change from any of these scenarios is unprecedented. Compared to climate change for the past millenium, even the 5 Tg case (</span></em> <strong><u>a war</u></strong> <em><span style="color: black;"> between India and Pakistan)</span></em> <strong><u>would plunge the planet into temperatures colder than the Little Ice Age</u></strong> <em><span style="color: black;">(approximately1600-1850 ). This would be essentially</span></em> <strong><u>instantly</u></strong> <em><span style="color: black;">, and</span></em> <strong><u>agriculture would be severely threatened</u></strong> <em><span style="color: black;">. Larger amounts of smoke would produce larger climate changes, and for the 150 Tg case produce a true nuclear winter, making agriculture impossible for years. In both cases,</span> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">new climate model simulations show that the effects would last for more than a decade</span></u>. <span style="color: black;">Analogs Support the Theory </span><u>Nuclear winter is a theory based on computer model calculations</u><span style="color: black;">. Normally, scientists test theories by doing experiments, but we never want to do this experiment in the real world. Thus we look for analogs that can inform us of parts of the theory. And</span> <u>there are</u> <span style="color: black;">many such</span> <u>analogs that convince us that the theory is correct</u><span style="color: black;">: Cities burning. Unfortunately, we have several examples of cities burning, firestorms created by the intense release of energy, and smoke being pumped into the upper atmosphere. These include San Francisco as a result of the earthquake in 1906, and cities bombed in World War II, including Tokyo, Dresden, Hamburg, Darmstadt, Hiroshima, and Nagasaki. The seasonal cycle. In the winter, the climate is cooler, because the days are shorter and sunlight is less intense. Again, this helps us quantify the effects of reduction of solar radiation. The diurnal cycle. At night the Sun sets and it gets cold at the surface. If the Sun did not rise tomorrow, we already have an intuitive feel for how much cooling would take place and how fast it would cool. Volcanic eruptions. Explosive volcanic eruptions, such as those of Tambora in 1815, Krakatau in 1883 and Pinatubo in 1991, provide several lessons. The resulting sulfate aerosol cloud in the stratosphere is transported around the world by winds, thus supporting the results from the animations above. The surface temperature plummets after each large eruption, in proportion to the thickness of the stratospheric cloud. In fact 1816, following Tambora, is known as the &quot;Year Without a Summer,&quot; with global cooling and famine. Following the Pinatubo eruption, global precipitation, river flow, and soil moisture all reduced, since cooling the planet by blocking sunlight has a strong effect on reducing evaporation and weakening the hydrologic cycle. This is also what the nuclear winter simulations show. Forest fires. Smoke from large forest fires sometimes is injected into the lower stratosphere. And the smoke is transported around the world, also producing cooling under the smoke. Dust storms on Mars. Occasionally, dust storms start in one region of Mars, but the dust is heated by the Sun, lofted into the upper atmosphere, and transported around the planet to completely enshroud it in a dust blanket. This process takes a couple weeks, just like our computer simulations for the nuclear winter smoke.

This </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">teaches us that </span></u></em><u><strong>large amounts of aerosols in Earth's atmosphere have caused massive climate change and extinction of species</strong></u> <em><span style="color: black;">. The difference with nuclear winter is that the K-T extinction could not have been prevented. <a name="Policy_Implications"></a>Policy Implications The work on nuclear winter in the 1980's, and the realization that both direct and indirect effects of nuclear war would be a global catastrophe, led to the end of arms race and the end of the Cold War. In response to the comment &quot;In the 1980s, you warned about the unprecedented dangers of nuclear weapons and took very daring steps to reverse the arms race,&quot; in an interview in 2000, Mikhail Gorbachev said &quot;Models made by Russian and American scientists showed that a nuclear war would result in a nuclear winter that would be extremely destructive to all life on Earth; the knowledge of that was a great stimulus to us, to people of honor and morality, to act in that situation.&quot;[1] Since the 1980's, the number of nuclear weapons in the world has decreased to 1/3 of the peak number of more than 70,000. The consequences of </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">regional-scale nuclear conflicts are unexpectedly large</span></u></strong><span style="color: black;">, with the potential to become</span> <u><strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">global catastrophes</span></strong></u>. <span style="color: black;">The combination of</span> <u>nuclear proliferation</u><span style="color: black;">, political instability, and urban demographics</span> <u>may constitute one of the greatest dangers to the stability of society since the dawn of humans</u><span style="color: black;">. The current and projected American and Russian nuclear arsenals can still produce nuclear winter. Only nuclear disarmament will prevent the possibility of a nuclear environmental catastrophe. </span></em><br />

<em><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Eradicating the idea that nuclear first use is an option</span></u> would have enormous implications. It <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">would </span>alter the expectations of politicians and commanders.</u> <u>It would</u> (or should)</em> <strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">influence military investment decisions</span></u></strong> <em><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;"> - </span></u></em><u><strong>more conventional capability may be necessary</strong></u> <em>, for example.[[#26|26]] <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">It</span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;"> <u>could affect public articulations of defense policy and military doctrine</u></span>. In the Soviet period, Moscow's NFU pledge was undermined by a profusion of military writings that emphasized nuclear preemption and warfighting and otherwise were in tension with NFU. But a genuine NFU strategy would need to harmonize doctrinal expositions and political explanations of defense policy with the constraints of the NFU commitment. <u>Changes in public rhetoric</u> alone will not be sufficient to convince the world that a NFU strategy is firmly in place. But they <u>could help send the message</u> that NFU was being taken seriously. NATO presently proclaims at every occasion that nuclear weapons are essential and that nuclear first-use is an integral component of alliance military strategy. If NATO instead were to proclaim that nuclear weapons are irrelevant to most of the alliance's security needs and that it could not envision circumstances in which it would use nuclear weapons first, this would certainly set a very different tone. War planning, of course, is not a public activity, though it has public outcroppings. So though this is a necessary step if NFU is to be real, it must be coupled with other, more visible steps, if others are to be convinced that NFU is more than declaratory policy. Exercises and training. <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Militaries</span></u>, goes the old aphorism, <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">fight the way they train</span></u>. <u>Military organizations are honed through years training and exercises to operate in certain ways with certain expectations. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">If exercises </span></u></em><u><strong>sometimes</strong> <strong>or routinely</strong> <em><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">involve scenarios that include nuclear first use, this will be visible to observers of the exercises and will be have impact on the way the military thinks and behaves</span></em></u><em>. NFU cannot be real if militaries are practicing as if nuclear weapons will be used first. In the context of a strategy of NFU, <u>exercises should ingrain the idea that first-use is entirely out of the picture and should not figure at all in the calculations of military commanders.</u> Force Composition and Disposition. A strategy of NFU would require or permit dramatic alterations in force posture. A purely deterrent force could be much smaller and simpler than the present arsenals of the larger nuclear powers. There would be no need for emphasis on speed or offensive readiness. (Readiness for survivability would, of course, remain desirable.) The force postures most compatible with NFU, and most convincing to other powers, would possess little or no capability for first-use. This proposition - that states should seek to minimize the first-use capacities of their nuclear arsenals - has potentially profound implications for nuclear posture. It could lead far down a road toward latent, residual, undeployed nuclear capabilities. In effect, this would entail the aggressive pursuit of deep dealerting.[[#27|27]] In the context of a strategy of NFU, nuclear forces need only survive survive an attack and be capable of retaliation. No other demands are placed upon them. This means that all readiness measures associated with first use options are superfluous, unnecessary, and even undesirable. Some categories of nuclear weapons - nonstrategic nuclear forces, for example - would become expendable. Forward deployed weapons, such as the American nuclear capabilities deployed in Europe, would be neither necessary nor appropriate. With offensive readiness no longer important, there would be no reason to leave warheads routinely mated to delivery systems. There might be little reason, indeed, to possess actively deployed nuclear weapons. There might be no compelling reason to leave nuclear weapons in the custody of military organizations. So long as survivability could be assured, there might be an argument for keeping few, if any, fully assembled nuclear weapons in the arsenal. Following this logic still further, in this sort of nuclear environment, states might grow comfortable not only with NFU, but with the notion of no-early-second-use - retaliation does not need to be prompt in order to deter. The end point of this logic might be something like the capacities of present day Japan, which might be regarded as a massively dealerted nuclear power. It possesses nuclear expertise, delivery systems, and fissile material. In some weeks or months it could build nuclear weapons for retaliation if it needed to. But no one fears its first use options. Thus, the premise of NFU, if taken seriously, produces a logic that can lead in stunning directions. In short, once nuclear arsenals are limited to purely deterrent purposes, it becomes possible to envision substantial alterations of force posture that would give considerable reality to NFU commitments. For the larger nuclear powers, one could imagine much smaller forces, deeply dealerted, incapable of rapid use, perhaps with warheads unmated from delivery systems, perhaps with warheads withdrawn from regular deployment. This is a very different nuclear force, far from anything presently in view, but one entirely compatible with a world dominated by deterrence and NFU. CONCLUSION To truly embrace a strategy of NFU has fundamentally important implications in terms of both purpose and posture. Nuclear-armed <u>states must be prepared to abandon the practice of exploiting nuclear weapons for the attainment of a variety of different purposes.</u></em> <u><strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Only</span></strong></u> <em>one</em> <strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;"> purpose is</span></u></strong> <em>compatible with NFU:</em> <strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">the deterrence of nuclear attack</span></u>. <u>All other purposes associated</u></strong> <em>with nuclear weapons must</em> <strong><u>be</u></strong> <em>jettisoned or</em> <strong><u>achieved by other means</u></strong> <em>. This is the crux of the issue. <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">If</span></u> nuclear weapon <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">states</span></u> were really prepared to <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">limit themselves purely to nuclear deterrence</span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">,</span> not only would NFU be acceptable but <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">many of the <strong>associated force posture alterations would become palatable</strong></span></u><strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">, <u>if not congenial</u></span></strong>. <u>However</u>, most nuclear-armed <u>states appear to have objectives beyond nuclear deterrence</u> that are thought to be served by their nuclear weapons, <u>leading to the embrace of first use doctrines</u> and the retention of first use options. Above all, the sole superpower has linked its nuclear capability to at least a handful of objectives other than nuclear deterrence, and hence finds NFU to be entirely objectionable. Washington correctly appreciates that NFU is incompatible with its present nuclear doctrine. So long as this remains the case, the genuine strategy of NFU will make little headway in the corridors of power. If the time someday comes when the nuclear powers are truly interested in a meaningful embrace of NFU, this will be a significant step toward the marginalization of nuclear weapons. It will mean that their role in international politics and national policy is much more circumscribed. <u>Once nuclear weapons have been restricted to the narrow purpose of neutralizing the nuclear weapons of others, a familiar logic comes into play: <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">if the only purpose for nuclear weapons is deterrence</span></strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">, then if no one has them no one needs them</span>.</u></em><br />

<em><span style="color: black;">In his 5 April 2009 speech in Prague, President</span> <u>Obama stated that the U</u>nited <u>S</u>tates <u>intends to “reduce the role of nuclear weapons</u><span style="color: black;"> in our na­tional security strategy.” </span><u>This reduction</u><span style="color: black;">, if achieved,</span> <u>does not signify</u> <span style="color: black;">the beginning of</span> <u>unilateral nuclear disarm</u>ament.<span style="color: black;"> The President was careful to note that nuclear deterrence would be necessary as long as other nations possess nuclear weapons, and that the goal of a nuclear-free world “will not be reached quickly, perhaps not in my lifetime.”</span></em><br />
<em><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">A reduction in the role that nuclear weapons</span></u></strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;"> play</span></u><span style="color: black;"> in America’s na­tional security strategy</span> <u><strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">requires a corresponding increase in conventional capabilities</span></strong></u><span style="color: black;">.

<em><span style="color: black;">This</span> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">increased role for conventional forces </span></u></em><u><strong>demands new thinking related to</strong></u> <em><span style="color: black;">the kinds of conventional</span></em> <u><strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">capabilities, targeting doctrines, warf­ighting strategies, deployment of forces, and strategic communication</span></strong> <em>nec­essary to deter both conventional- and WMD-armed opponents</em></u><em><span style="color: black;">.

<span style="color: black;">In the Cold War, nuclear deterrence was called the balance of terror. Of course, the threat levels have changed and arms control agreements allow smaller numbers of nuclear warheads. However, the US keeps nuclear-armed bombers and submarines ready for alert, and several hundred nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missiles. But today’s challenges are different. What’s emerging is how conventional deterrence may dominate America’s hard and soft power options in the years ahead. Just look at the landscape.</span> <strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Russia</span></u></strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;"> has been engaging in Cold War-style antics</span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">. <strong><u>China</u></strong><u>’s</u></span> <span style="color: black;">“peaceful rise”</span> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">policy is buttressed by</span></u> <span style="color: black;">its</span> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">military build-up</span></u>. <u>Many nations are pursuing</u> <u>sophisticated tech</u>nologies <span style="color: black;">from stealthy unmanned systems to advanced air defenses capable of finding and destroying targets 100 miles away.</span> <strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Rogue states</span></u></strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;"> are getting closer to nuclear</span></u> <span style="color: black;">weapons</span> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">arsenals</span></u> <span style="color: black;">of their own,</span> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">and most</span></u> <span style="color: black;">already</span> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">have significant conventional forces</span></u>. <u>As Chair</u>man <u>of the Joint Chiefs of Staff</u> <span style="color: black;">Admiral Michael G. Mullen</span> <u>put it</u>: “<strong><u>It is way past time to reexamine our strategic thinking about deterrence</u></strong><strong><span style="color: black;">.” 2 </span></strong><span style="color: black;">Defining Conventional Deterrence </span><u>Conventional deterrence is the ability of one nation</u><span style="color: black;"> (or a group of allies) </span><u>to show they have and will use stronger forces to make sure an aggressor state can’t achieve its ends</u><span style="color: black;">. Calculation is everything, so conventional deterrence works only when an aggressor is certain that they can’t get away with what they are contemplating because they will be stopped cold by superior force. Airpower is one of the important tools for conventional deterrence. It’s certainly a credible instrument. The US put on displays of air mastery in Iraq (1991), Kosovo (1999), Afghanistan (2001) and again in Iraq (2003). In the last two decades, the US has used airstrikes to contain dictators, punish aggression, turn around international violations of sovereignty and stop regime-inflicted humanitarian disasters. No-fly zones squelched Iraqi military activity for a decade. </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">There’s no reason</span></u> <u>to think <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">the US will depend less on</span></u><span style="color: black;"> airpower for </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">conventional deterrence in the future</span></u><u>.</u><span style="color: black;"> It remains just the type of flexible, proportionate tool essential to credible, conventional deterrence.</span> <u>Gates explained the need</u> <span style="color: black;">for options well.</span> <u>“A conventional strike force means that more targets are vulnerable without</u> <span style="color: black;">our</span> <u>having to resort to nuclear weapons</u><span style="color: black;">,” he said. 3 So it’s reasonable to ask: is the US keeping far enough ahead to make its conventional deterrence effective? The answer depends, in part, on US airpower in general, and the F-22 in particular. This paper examines one vital aspect of conventional deterrence: how to assure that the US can open up the airspace and execute a conventional strike.</span> <strong><em><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Trends now suggest that America can’t take that advantage for granted</span></u></em></strong><span style="color: black;">, or rely on airpower’s conventional deterrence for much longer.</span> <strong><em><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Potential adversaries are moving way too fast</span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;"> <u>on</u></span></em></strong> <span style="color: black;">aircraft,</span> <strong><em><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">weapons and tactics and the gap is narrowing</span></u></em></strong><span style="color: black;">. Instead of nuclear warhead throw-weight and survivable second strike, the technical details of the balance for conventional deterrence in the 21st Century may come down to stealth and supersonic speed without afterburner. Conventional Deterrence Then And Now America’s defense officials once followed the relative standings of conventional forces very closely. Conventional deterrence came into vogue in the 1980s when Cold War tensions with the Soviet Union revived interest in strong conventional forces as deterrents in their own right. Back then, scholars researched case studies on historical and regional conflicts and re-examined how military might on each side influenced the causes of wars. Keen interest developed in whether NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) and the Warsaw Pact could restrain themselves and fight a conventional war in Europe without resorting to nuclear weapons – and if so, who would prevail. Major improvements in air and land forces followed. All that preparation for Europe turned out to be unnecessary – but highly useful elsewhere. No challengers arose to test the ability of the US to employ airpower as it chose. However,</span> <strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">the balance may be shifting</span></u></strong> <span style="color: black;">again. In the last two years,</span> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Russia, India and China have</span></u> <span style="color: black;">all announced or</span> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">clarified major defense programs</span></u> <span style="color: black;">that include everything from the development of advanced fighters to upgrading aircraft carriers. Turns out,</span> <u>adversaries took careful note of</u> <span style="color: black;">the way</span> <u>America</u> <span style="color: black;">and its allies used air</span> <u>dominance</u> <span style="color: black;">in all its operations.</span> <u>They reshaped their defense plans</u> <span style="color: black;">to make inroads on that asymmetric advantage. </span><u>They are building advanced missiles, aircraft and subsystems and there’s also a world market for their best wares</u>. <span style="color: black;">For all these reasons,</span> <u>conventional deterrence is moving up the list of jobs for America’s military</u><span style="color: black;">. According to Mullen: </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">A big part of credibility</span></u></strong><span style="color: black;">, of course,</span> <strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">lies in our conventional capability</span></u>.</strong> <u>The capability to project U.S. military power globally and conduct effective theater-level operations</u> <span style="color: black;">across the domains of land, sea, air, space, cyberspace, and information – including the capability to win decisively – </span><u>remains essential to deterrence effectiveness. <strong>We must</strong></u> <span style="color: black;">therefore </span><strong><u>address our conventional force structure and its readiness as a deterrent factor,</u></strong> <u>especially after 7 years at war</u>.<span style="color: black;"> No one is suggesting that deterrence in this multi-polar world will be the same as the Cold War. Far from it. For one thing, America will not have the same economic dominance it once enjoyed. America’s economy will still probably be the biggest for a time, but economic and financial peers are already on the scene. Some forecast China’s economy may grow fast enough to overtake the US. With China, and other nations, military deterrence will be one part of a much wider relationship encompassing trade agreements, financial deals, diplomacy, and yes, other competition for global influence as China navigates its “peaceful rise.” Instead of spies and the Berlin Wall, the deterrence of the 21st Century will include gala state dinners, toasts with strong liquor, and a shifting series of international consortia and negotiations on everything from trade to climate change. However,</span> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">low-level military friction is likely to be a constant</span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">. <u>Russia will be active on its borders and China will continue to build global ties</u></span><u>. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Expect the spheres of influence of the major world powers to collide</span> from time to time</u>. <span style="color: black;">THE NEW DETERRENCE METRICS </span><strong><em><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Conventional deterrence will have a big role in shaping those collisions</span></u></em></strong> <em>– <strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">and whether they turn out to be occasional jostling or</span></u></strong></em> <span style="color: black;">more</span> <strong><em><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">serious face-offs</span></u></em></strong>.

Bounding the Study Deterrence is a complex and dynamic concept involving political, psychological, cultural, and military elements. Given the multifaceted nature of deterrence, our initial task was to develop and define the parameters of our research. After consultation with the project sponsor, we bound the study in the following ways: First, we have limited our analysis to conventional deterrence. Although nuclear deterrence remains an essential element of U.S. national security strategy,</span> <u>many future contingencies are likely to stem from conventional threats</u><span style="color: black;">. As discussed above,</span> <u>U.S. conventional power is likely to be the most</u> <span style="color: black;">credible deterrent when dealing with these security challenges. Moreover, although the body of academic literature on deterrence is vast, the majority of it is focused solely on the nuclear component. Given the centrality of nuclear deterrence throughout the Cold War - the period in which deterrence theory was developed - there has been significantly less examination of deterrence at the conventional level. Consequently, one objective of</span> <u>this study</u> <span style="color: black;">is to</span> <u>provide fresh analysis on the theory and practice of</u> <span style="color: black;">conventional </span><u>deterrence</u>. <span style="color: black;">Second, our analysis is focused on identifying the range of maritime capabilities and operations that can contribute to deterrence, rather than which specific combination is most likely to have the largest deterrent effect in any particular context. ' The Navy has a wide range of kinetic and non-kinetic tools that can be used to protect, acquire, and otherwise further U.S. interests, and in order to develop and implement effective deterrence strategies, it must first identify which assets, capabilities, and operations are applicable and useful for the deterrence mission. Effective deterrence requires all elements of national power across the D.I.M.E. (diplomatic, information, military, economics) spectrum, and our objective is to determine how and where maritime power provides important and unique contributions to deterrence within this broader framework. Third, based on the sponsor's guidance, this study is focused on U.S. deterrence strategies against sovereign states.</span> <u>While there has been</u> <span style="color: black;">a significant amount of attention in recent years to deterring terrorists and other non-state actors,</span> <u>the potential for inter-state conflict</u> <span style="color: black;">still </span><u>remains.</u> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">In the coming decades, <strong>shifts in the balance of global military</strong></span></u><span style="color: black;">, economic, and political</span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;"> power can create new possibilities for international competition, crises, and conflict, especially over global energy resources</span></u></strong><span style="color: black;">. Consequently, our objective is to analyze how</span> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">U.S. conventional power can</span></u> <span style="color: black;">help </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">deter</span></u> <span style="color: black;">state-on-state</span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;"> crises and conflicts</span></u>. <span style="color: black;">Fourth,</span> <u>we pay particular attention to extended deterrence</u> <span style="color: black;">- the threat of force used to deter attacks on friends and allies. We do not deny or downplay the critical importance of deterring direct attacks on the U.S. homeland, especially given global trends in the proliferation and modernization of ballistic missiles. In fact, most of our analysis is applicable to both extended deterrence and &quot;central&quot; deterrence (the threat of force to deter attacks on one's homeland). But, in general,</span> <u>extended deterrence is</u> <span style="color: black;">more </span><u>challenging</u> <span style="color: black;">than central deterrence</span> <u>because it can be difficult to convince others that the U</u>nited <u>S</u>tates <u>would actually be willing to run potentially significant risks to protect another country</u>. <span style="color: black;">As Thomas Schelling observed, ...the difference between the national homeland and everything 'abroad' is the difference between threats that are inherently credible, even if unspoken, and the threats that have to be made credible. To project the shadow of one's military force over other countries and territories is an act of diplomacy. To fight abroad is a military act, but</span> <u>to persuade enemies or allies that one would fight abroad</u><span style="color: black;">, under circumstances of great cost and risk,</span> <u>requires more than a military capability. It requires projecting intentions</u>. <u>It requires having those intentions, even deliberately acquiring them, and communicating them persuasively to make other countries behave</u>.&quot; <u>Developing credible extended deterrence strategies is</u> <span style="color: black;">especially </span><u>important because it is likely that many future security challenges will involve deterring attacks against</u> <span style="color: black;">friends and</span> <u>allies.</u> <u>The two <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">scenarios</span> that currently dominate planning and procurement</u> <span style="color: black;">for Major Combat Operations (MCOs) </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">involve</span></u> <span style="color: black;">issues of extended deterrence - the protection and defense of</span> <strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">South Korea</span></u></strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;"> and <strong>Taiwan</strong></span></u><span style="color: black;">. Similarly,</span> <u>many concerns about direct <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Russian or Iranian aggression</span></strong> are focused on threats to states in their respective regions, such as Ukraine and Georgia in the case of Russia, and Israel, Turkey, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia for Iran</u>. <span style="color: black;">Finally, we examine conventional deterrence in peacetime, crises, and in the opening stages of conflict. According to the new Maritime Strategy,</span> <u>in an increasingly globalized and interconnected world, international crises and conflict can have <strong>devastating ripple effects on the</strong></u> <span style="color: black;">peaceful and productive functioning of the</span> <strong><u>global system</u></strong>.&quot; <u>In order to prevent severe disruptions to the global system, deterrence efforts must begin during peacetime</u> <span style="color: black;">(Phase 0), contribute to the peaceful resolution of crises (Phase 1),</span> <u>and, if conflict erupts, provide</u> <span style="color: black;">decision-makers with useful</span> <u>tools for quick termination of the conflict</u> <span style="color: black;">on terms favorable to the United States (Phase 2). Although most of our analysis is centered on conventional deterrence before conflict begins, we will briefly examine the role of deterrence and other forms of military coercion at the outset of conflict to demonstrate how threats of force - including the limited use of force - can help deter escalation and terminate conflicts.</span> Pg. 9-14</em><br />

For instance, the United States is the dominant naval power everywhere, such that other nations cannot compete with it even in their home waters. They either happily or grudgingly allow the United States Navy to be the guarantor of international waterways and trade routes, of international access to markets and raw materials such as oil. Even when the United States engages in a war, it is able to play its role as guardian of the waterways. In a more genuinely multipolar world, however, it would not. Nations would compete for naval dominance at least in their own regions and possibly beyond. <u>Conflict between nations would involve struggles on the oceans as well as on land. Armed embargos, of the kind used in World War I and other major conflicts, would disrupt trade flows in a way that is now impossible</u>. Such order as exists in the world rests not merely on the goodwill of peoples but on a foundation provided by American power. Even the European Union, that great geopolitical miracle, owes its founding to American power, for without it the European nations after World War ii would never have felt secure enough to reintegrate Germany. Most Europeans recoil at the thought, but even today <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Europe's stability depends on</span></u> <u>the guarantee,</u> <span class="Style1CharCharChar">however distant and one hopes unnecessary, </span><u>that the <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">U</span></u>nited <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; border: 1pt solid windowtext;">S</span></u>tates <u>could step in <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">to check any dangerous development</span> on the continent. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">In a</span> genuinely <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">multipolar world, </span>that <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">would not be possible without</span> renewing the danger of <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">world war</span></strong></u><strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; border: 1pt solid windowtext;">.</span></strong> People who believe greater equality among nations would be preferable to the present American predominance often succumb to a basic logical fallacy. They believe the order the world enjoys today exists independently of American power. They imagine that in a world where American power was diminished, the aspects of international order that they like would remain in place. But that 's not the way it works. International order does not rest on ideas and institutions. It is shaped by configurations of power. The international order we know today reflects the distribution of power in the world since World War ii, and especially since the end of the Cold War. A different configuration of power, a multipolar world in which the poles were Russia, China, the United States, India, and Europe, would produce its own kind of order, with different rules and norms reflecting the interests of the powerful states that would have a hand in shaping it. Would that international order be an improvement? Perhaps for Beijing and Moscow it would. But it is doubtful that it would suit the tastes of enlightenment liberals in the United States and Europe. The current order, of course, is not only far from perfect but also offers no guarantee against major conflict among the world's great powers. <u>Even under the umbrella of unipolarity, regional conflicts involving the large powers may erupt. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">War could erupt between China</span> and <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Taiwan</span></u> and draw in both the United States and Japan. War could erupt <u>between <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Russia</span> and <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Georgia,</span></u> forcing the United States and its European allies to decide whether to intervene or suffer the consequences of a Russian victory. Conflict <u>between <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">India</span> and <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Pakistan</span></u> remains possible, as does conflict <u>between <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Iran</span> and <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Israel</span> or other <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Middle Eastern states</span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">.</span> These, too, could draw in other great powers, including the United States. Such conflicts may be unavoidable no matter what policies the United States pursues. <u>But they are <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">more likely to erupt if</span> the <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">U</span></u>nited <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; border: 1pt solid windowtext;">S</span></u>tates <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">weakens</span></u> <u>or <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">withdraws</span> from its positions of regional dominance</u>. This is especially true <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">in East Asia,</span></u> <u>where most nations agree that a <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">reliable American power has a stabilizing</span> and pacific <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">effect</span> on the region</u>. That is certainly the view of most of China 's neighbors. But even China, which seeks gradually to supplant the United States as the dominant power in the region, faces the dilemma that an American withdrawal could unleash an ambitious, independent, nationalist Japan. <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">In Europe</span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">,</span> too, <u>the <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">departure of</span> the <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">U</span></u>nited <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; border: 1pt solid windowtext;">S</span></u>tates from the scene -- even if it remained the world's most powerful nation -- <u>could be destabilizing. It <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">could tempt Russia to an </span>even more <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">overbearing</span> and potentially <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">forceful approach to unruly nations on its peripher</span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">y.</span> Although some realist theorists seem to imagine that the disappearance of the Soviet Union put an end to the possibility of confrontation between Russia and the West, and therefore to the need for a permanent American role in Europe, history suggests that conflicts in Europe involving Russia are possible even without Soviet communism. <u>If the U</u>nited <u>S</u>tates withdrew from Europe -- if it <u>adopted</u> what some call <u>a strategy of <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">&quot;offshore balancing&quot;</span> -- this <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">could</span></u> in time <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">increase</span></u> <u>the <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">likelihood of conflict involving Russia and</span> its near <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">neighbors,</span> which could in turn <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">draw</span> the <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">U</span></strong></u>nited <strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">S</span></u></strong>tates <strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">back in</span></u></strong> under unfavorable circumstances. <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">It is</span></u> <u>also <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">optimistic to imagine that</span> a <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">retrenchment</span> of the American position <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">in the Middle East</span> and the assumption of a more passive, &quot;offshore&quot; role <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">would lead to</span> greater <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">stability </span>there</u>. The vital interest the United States has in access to oil and the role it plays in keeping access open to other nations in Europe and Asia make it unlikely that American leaders could or would stand back and hope for the best while the powers in the region battle it out. Nor would a more &quot;even-handed&quot; policy toward Israel, which some see as the magic key to unlocking peace, stability, and comity in the Middle East, obviate the need to come to Israel 's aid if its security became threatened. That commitment, paired with the American commitment to protect strategic oil supplies for most of the world, practically ensures a heavy American military presence in the region, both on the seas and on the ground. The subtraction of American power from any region would not end conflict but would simply change the equation. <u>In the Middle East, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">competition</span> for influence among powers both inside and outside the region <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">has raged for </span>at least two <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">centuries.</span> The rise of <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Islamic fundamentalism</span> doesn't change this. It only <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">adds a new</span> and more <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">threatening dimension</span> to the competition</u>, which neither a sudden end to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians nor an immediate American withdrawal from Iraq would change. <u>The <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">alternative to American predominance</span></u> <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext;">in the region <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">i</span></u></span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; border: 1pt solid windowtext;">s <strong>not balance and peace. It is further competition.</strong></span></u> The region and the states within it remain relatively weak. <u>A diminution of American influence would not be followed by a diminution of other external influences. One could expect deeper involvement by both China and Russia</u>, if only to secure their interests. 18 And one could also expect the more powerful states of the region, particularly Iran, to expand and fill the vacuum. It is doubtful that any American administration would voluntarily take actions that could shift the balance of power in the Middle East further toward Russia, China, or Iran. The world hasn 't changed that much. An American withdrawal from Iraq will not return things to &quot;normal&quot; or to a new kind of stability in the region. It will produce a new instability, one likely to draw the United States back in again. The alternative to American regional predominance in the Middle East and elsewhere is not a new regional stability. In an era of burgeoning nationalism, the future is likely to be one of intensified competition among nations and nationalist movements. Difficult as it may be to extend American predominance into the future, no one should imagine that a reduction of American power or a retraction of American influence and global involvement will provide an easier path.</em><br />

Concretely, George Kennan described the United States—and democracies in general—as prehistoric dinosaurs with very small brains, stupidly unable to anticipate and deal with problems until they become life-threatening but simultaneously capable of enormous destruction once a truly dangerous threat is upon them.49 This mirrors the classic American fallacy that there is one big threat, or type of enemy, that deserves attention to the exclusion of all others. Ironically, given the COIN community’s propensity to elevate irregular war over other forms of conflict, it is this strategic fallacy that led to the degradation of COIN capabilities after Vietnam in the first place. Given that <strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; color: black;">the</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; color: black;"> U</span></u></strong>nited <strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; color: black;">S</span></u></strong>tates must be ready for future irregular wars but <strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; color: black;">must</span></u></strong> also maintain and<strong><u><span style="color: black;"> <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">strengthen its conventional warfighting capaci</span>ty</span></u></strong><strong>,</strong> it is entirely possible to have parts of the Army and Marine Corps optimized for COIN while optimizing the Navy and Air Forces for higher intensity engagements. This sort of division of labor makes sense given that <u><span style="color: black;">most foreseeable conventional contingencies are likely to rely heavily on naval and air assets</span></u>, though ground assets will play an important role as well. Hoehn et al’s report for the RAND Corporation on the future of the American military offers one potential blueprint for adopting a more clear-cut division of labor scheme. They argue that U.S. ground forces should orient themselves primarily, though not exclusively, towards dealing with irregular challenges, while <strong><u><span style="color: black;">the Navy and Air Force should</span></u></strong><u><span style="color: black;"> primarily</span></u>, though not exclusively, <strong><u><span style="color: black;">devote themselves towards maintaining</span></u></strong><u><span style="color: black;"> American <strong>power projection capabilities and conventional superiority</strong> over the global commons</span></u><span style="color: black;">.</span>50 Within the land services, good infantry and mechanized tactics, techniques and procedures are as necessary for fighting the Taliban as they were for fighting the Soviets. Adding crowd control and civil-military operations to the list of basic skills for infantry would never practically mean not training them how to operate against other conventionally trained infantry. The Chinese/Russians have tanks, and al Qaeda does not—but they do use vehicles. Calling in fire or using infantry weapons are pretty much the same tasks no matter the target. Some key questions for U.S. land forces involve doctrine, officer training, and procurement. Some members of the land warfare community have argued that the newest Operations manual (Manual 3-0) borrowed too heavily from COIN doctrine. This implies that all Army operations for the near future will be governed by principles and structures ideal for operating in an irregular war, specifically, Iraq.51 Many of the things that the Army should do to make these systems/processes better – for example, including culture in planning and assessment – should be done anyway, and in planning for every contingency, not just COIN. Not every part of every service has to do the same job—there are air assault divisions and mountain divisions in the Army, so why not have COIN-focused BCTs with advising specialists?52 Moreover, one outcome likely to be wasteful in a budgetary sense is if the Army fails to resolve its debate over its future and maximizes for both conventional operations and COIN. Neither will be necessary if the United States Navy cannot get Army units to a future conflict and the Air Force cannot protect them from air strikes. Fortunately, just as training troops to understand foreign cultures and other elements of the ‘‘soft’’ side of COIN are helpful for building the capabilities necessary to win conventional wars, many ‘‘high’’ technology elements essential for conventional wars, like rapid over-the-horizon strike capabilities, UAVs, satellite phones, etc., are also helpful for COIN and asymmetric warfare. Even asymmetric conflicts on the sea and in the air require conventional platforms—or at least the most advanced platforms. One example of investment overlap could be next-generation UAVs. UAVs based on similar research and development streams, might be useful both for the COIN role for which they have been praised and the fighter-replacement role. The Air Force may fight hard because of the way it will disrupt the its fighter pilot-dominant organizational hierarchy. In the meantime, the United States will still need carriers for power projection and to protect the flank of U.S. forces deployed in theater. Another example of the links between COIN capabilities and air and naval forces comes from the methods used by the American military to assist its units or Iraqi Security Forces when they call for help. Air-dropped precision guided munitions (PGMs) and UAVs have replaced indirect artillery in many cases since they are faster and more accurate. Over the last year, when Iraqi Security Forces have engaged insurgents without a massive U.S. land force component backing them up, or when they call for help, it is U.S. fixed wing and rotary wing aircraft that have played a decisive role. For example, in Basra, when Coalition Forces backed up Iraqi Security Forces who struggled to implement Operation Knights’ Charge, air support made an important difference. Finally, <strong><u><span style="color: black;">investments in basic defense science are essential</span></u></strong><u><span style="color: black;">. </span></u>As is logical, given that the United States is fighting two wars, increases in defense spending in this decade have gone mostly towards personnel, as well as operations and maintenance (O&amp;M). Between the ‘‘peace dividend’’ taken at the end of the Cold War and the budgetary focus of this decade, <strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; color: black;">investments in basic research and development for the weapons of the future has suffered</span></u></strong>. While the FY2009 budget contains an increase of 2 percent in the base DOD budget to $76.9 billion, current defense projections call for a 20 percent decrease in research and development from FY2009-2013, with the savings going into procurement for existing weapons systems. If anything, <strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; color: black;">uncertainty</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="color: black;"> about the future character of war <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">should lead to a greater emphasis on research</span></span></u></strong><u><span style="color: black;"> and development spending. By spending a modest amount </span></u>of money in promising research areas,<u><span style="color: black;"> the U</span></u>nited <u><span style="color: black;">S</span></u>tates <u><span style="color: black;">can help ensure that it not only leads the way in this generation of military weaponry, but in the next generation as well</span></u><span style="color: black;">. </span>In particular, funding for basic defense science—detached from systems close to production—is essential. While results-based funding helps ensure accountability, it also leads to a focus on incremental research that discourages the experimentation necessary to lead to breakthroughs. However, the FY2009 budget proposed only $11.5 billion in Science &amp; Technology (S&amp;T) funding, a decrease of 3 percent from FY2000.53 Conclusion At present, the dominant strands of defense strategy debates feature COIN advocates that wish to transform the American military to focus more on counterinsurgency and irregular wars and traditionalists who seek to return the American military to focusing exclusively on conventional wars. This debate presents a false choice. <strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; color: black;">The national strategy of the U</span></u></strong>nited <strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; color: black;">S</span></u></strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">ta</span>tes <u><span style="color: black;">calls for remaining actively engaged around the world, which will sometimes <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">require using military force abroad</span></strong></span></u><span style="color: black;">. </span>It is necessary, in a world of limited budgets, to move beyond the COIN v. Conventional War debate, especially because by embracing a zero-sum vision of future war, and trading one capability for the other, it makes facing the neglected threat more likely. Given uncertainty about the future security environment and the future character of war in the information age, a hedging strategy seems prudent. <strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; color: black;">By</span></u></strong> optimizing different aspects of the military for different campaigns, recognizing significant differences in the types of campaigns that are most likely at different levels of intensity, <strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; color: black;">investing in</span></u></strong><u><span style="color: black;"> defense systems with applicability to</span></u> both COIN and <strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; color: black;">conventional</span></u></strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; color: black;"> <strong>campaigns</strong></span></u><span style="color: black;">, and bolstering funding for basic defense science research,</span><u><span style="color: black;"> <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">the U</span></strong></span></u>nited <strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; color: black;">S</span></u></strong>tates <strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; color: black;">can ensure that it remains the leading global military power</span></u></strong> <span style="color: black;">not only for this generation, but also for the next, as</span> well.

<em>It is important to recognize at the outset two key points about United States strategy and the potential costs and benefits for the United States in a changing security environment. First<strong>,</strong> <strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">the U</span></u></strong><strong><u>nited</u></strong><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;"> S</span></u></strong><strong><u>tates</u></strong><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;"> is very likely to remain fully engaged in global affairs</span></u></strong><u>. Advocates of restraint or global withdrawal</u>, while popular in some segments of academia, <u>remain</u> <u>on the margins of policy debates</u> in Washington D.C. This could always change, of course. However, at present, <u>it is a given that <strong>the U</strong></u><strong><u>nited</u></strong> <strong><u>S</u></strong><strong><u>tates</u></strong> <strong><u>will define its interests globally</u></strong> <u>and pursue a strategy</u> that requires capable military forces able <u>to</u> <u>project power around the world</u>. Because ‘‘indirect’’ counter-strategies are the rational choice for actors facing a strong state’s power projection, irregular/asymmetric threats are inevitable given America’s role in the global order.24 Second, <strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">the worst-case scenario is a loss of U.S. conventional superiority</span></u></strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">. <strong>Losing military control of the</strong></span></u> <u>sea and the air, ‘‘the <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">global commons</span></strong></u><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">,’’25</span></u><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;"> <strong>would render American global strategy outmoded in an instant</strong>.</span></u> The idea that the United States must improve its capacity to fight counterinsurgency operations presumes a need to do so beyond defending the homeland and that the United States will have the capacity to intervene in future conflicts around the world. However, while it seems unlikely at present, what if developments in warfare cut down and then eliminated the conventional military superiority of the United States? <u>The <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">loss of conventional military superiority</span></strong> by the United States <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">would</span></strong> probably <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">make the current strategic environment look like a picnic</span></strong></u>.26 For example, currently a Marine unit deploying to Afghanistan or Iraq focuses most on the post-deployment battlefield tasks. However, <u>imagine a world where commanders and <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">soldiers</span></strong></u>, like their World War II forbears, <u>must <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">fear being sunk</span></strong> on a transport ship <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">or shot out of the sky</span></strong></u> on the way over, or being targeted by electronic, nanotechnological, or directed energy or precision guided munitions when preparing to search a village for insurgents.27 <u>In such a strategic environment, <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">overseas deployments</span></strong></u> to win hearts and minds in a low intensity war or wipe out radical jihadi groups <strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">would</span></u></strong> <u>likely—and logically— <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">take a backseat</span></strong> to more ‘‘traditional’’ concerns: convoys, tank battles, air and coastal defenses</u><u>,</u> and crash programs to build a new generation of naval and air weapons to take back the seas and skies. Meanwhile, <u>in the interim, <strong>t<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">he U</span></strong>nited <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">S</span></strong>tates <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">homeland would be more at risk</span></strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;"> <strong>than at any p</strong></span><strong>oint</strong></u> since the World War II—arguably more threatened than <strong><u>in its entire history</u></strong>. What John Mearsheimer has called the ‘‘stopping power of water’’ previously functioned to shield the United States, with its oceanic buffers to the east and west, from existential threats. However, in the information age and if the United States no longer controls the waterways of the world, water may not be enough. <strong>A <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">world without American conventional</span></u></strong> <u>military <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">superiority would</span></strong></u> <u>also</u> <strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">encourage aggression</span></u></strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;"> <strong>by regional actors eager to settle score</strong></span></u><strong><u>s</u></strong> <u>and take advantage of the</u></em><br />

<em><span style="color: black;">Vol. 1, 2006, 35–55]</span></em><br />
<em><span style="color: black;">The basic argument of power parity is that key contenders in the international system challenge one another for dominance when they anticipate that the prospects of overtaking the regime leader are credible. An important new insight emerges from Figure 1.</span> <strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Conflict can still take place despite strong power asymmetry, but its severity will be much reduced. This deduction is supported by empirical evidence</span></u></strong>.</em><br />
<em><u>When the global hierarchy was uniform</u>, <u>the U</u>nited <u>S</u>tates <span style="color: black;">and its allies were</span> <u>engaged in W</u>orld <u>W</u>ar <u>II</u>. <span style="color: black;">After 1945, the United States emerged as the preponderant power. </span><u>It</u> <span style="color: black;">continued to</span> <u>wage wars in Korea, Vietnam, Kuwait and Iraq, but these wars produced limited casualties (compared to World Wars</u><span style="color: black;">), as did the attack on the US by Al Qaeda. Despite US preponderance, these wars were not deterred but losses were reduced. This formally derived figure also accounts for what Bueno de Mesquita and Lalman identify as a seeming contradiction; the Seven Weeks’ War between Austria and Prussia occurred at parity, but both nations were jointly satisfied producing a conflict of low intensity among contenders.</span> <u>The probability of conflict under parity is high, thus the conflict, but the structural constraints imposed by satisfaction kept the severity of that war limited</u>.<span style="color: black;">8</span></em><br />
<em><span style="color: black;">This new representation of the parity model also offers a formal answer to the argument of Choucri and North that the theory is inconsistent in failing to account for the peaceful transfer of control over the world hierarchy from England to the United States.9 As Figure 1 indicates,</span> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">the condition required for peace</span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">ful</span> <span style="color: black;">overtaking </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">be<u>tween two major powers includes agreement on the rules that guide the hierarchy</u></span><u>. It is not just power relations</u><span style="color: black;">—as realists would argue—</span><u>that lead nations to wage conflict. Agreement or disagreement with preferences</u>, <span style="color: black;">in coordination with parity,</span> <u>leads to war and peace</u>.10</em><br />
<em><span style="color: black;">This leads us to the final unexpected implication of the graphic that informs our political strategy. At the bottom left corner, Figure 1 accounts for the process of integration.</span> <u>Integration is the most important new phenomenon emerging since W</u>orld <u>W</u>ar <u>II</u>. <span style="color: black;">A comparison of Figures 1 and 2 shows that this process is most likely in a post-overtaking asymmetric period.</span> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Deutsch et al</span>.</u> <span style="color: black;">independently</span> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">observed</span></u> <span style="color: black;">such a pattern in 1957. They indicated</span> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">that integration did not take place when nations were at parity</span></u>. <u>Rather, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">integration occurred</span></u> <span style="color: black;">around ‘cores of strength’</span> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">where a dominant nation provided the ‘nucleus’</span> for integration</u><span style="color: black;">.11</span></em><br />
<em><u>A hierarchy dominated by a preponderant nation imposes high costs for conflict on smaller challengers and reduces costs for integration</u>. <u>This produces a bias towards stability</u><span style="color: black;">. The dominant power desires to maintain the status quo. As Keohane correctly infers, preponderant powers have the ability to absorb the costs of integration and allow smaller nations to ‘free ride’ because their actions are consistent with stable economic growth.12</span> <strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">In a uniform hierarchy</span></u></strong> <span style="color: black;">(Figure 2),</span> <strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">the probability of conflict and escalation to severe war increases, while prospects for integrations are reduced</span>.</u></strong> <u>No single party is willing to carry the burden of integration</u><span style="color: black;">, and concurrently each member of the hierarchy is able to enhance individual growth by avoiding the costs of the collective good. Thus, rather than supporting trade opportunities that lead to expansion among all, large nations that can affect the market price of goods impose tariffs in a selfish attempt to advance their own growth.13</span></em><br />
<em><span style="color: black;">Policy Implications </span></em><br />
<em><span style="color: black;">The internal mobilization of resources, and effective alliance formation or neutralization, can be manipulated in response to policy changes. A reliable strategic perspective is needed to make choices in world politics, particularly for the</span> <u>U</u>nited <u>S</u>tates<span style="color: black;">, as key</span> <u>decisions can sway the balance in favour of either global stability or instability.</u></em><br />
<em><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">There is <strong>substantial empirical support for the power parity proposition</strong> throughout the conflict literature</span>.</u><span style="color: black;">14 In other research environments, such formal and empirical evidence would have been sufficient to challenge the fundamental assertion that a parity or ‘balance of power’ preserves peace. However, given the widely held belief among practitioners and academics that the underlying logic of balance of power is correct, these two research directions continue to develop side by side. The collapse of the Soviet Union is one such critical test that has awakened the need to reformulate long-held beliefs.</span> pg. 40-43</em><br />

<em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Haiti also endured 60 years of U.S. embargo, almost 20 years of U.S. occupations as well as intervention through the backing of military dictatorships and the undermining of the democratic process with the ousting of democratically elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in 2004. In</span> <u>the course of the U.S. developing a future relationship with Haiti, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">it is essential that we reconcile</span> and address the <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">detrimental policies of the past</span> so that future policies serve the interests of the Haitian masses</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> as opposed to the ruling class and foreign corporate interests. Three days </span><u>after the catastrophic earthquake</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, the </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Obama</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> administration </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">announced that it will grant temporary protected status</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> for 18 months to </span><u>Haitian immigrants living in the U.S. before Jan. 12</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>This</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> order </span><u>will allow</u> <u>Haitian residents</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the opportunity </span><u>to receive a work permit</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>However, it excludes Haitians who arrive on U.S. soil after Jan. 12</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">; </span><u>they will be deported back to Haiti</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">It</span> also <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">doesn't</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> address the waiving of the $500 application fee to receive temporary protected status; nor does it </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">lead to the granting of a permanent status</span></u></strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;"> to Haitian residents</span> after the 18-month expiration date</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>Addressing this issue is paramount and would greatly improve the economy of Haiti, as Haitian immigrants in the U.S. send more than $1 billion in remittances, according to the Inter-American Development Bank</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> -- more than one-third of Haiti's gross national product. In addition, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">the U.S. has received sharp criticism for</span> <strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">past <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">discriminatory practices</span></span></strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;"> toward Haitian immigrants</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, as compared with other immigrant groups. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">T</span></span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">he <strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">U.S. should be held accountable</span></strong> in administering</span> a clear and just application of immigration policy that renders <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">equal treatment</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">and consideration to all immigrants. In order to accelerate the process of Haiti's much-needed growth and development, an immediate retiring of all debt that Haiti has incurred should be supported by the U.S. and international community. Rep. Barbara Lee, a California Democrat who serves as chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, introduced a resolution on Haiti last week recommending debt forgiveness for the impoverished nation. Also, future foreign aid should be in the form of grants rather than loans, as past loans from the U.S and International Monetary Fund (IMF) have been interest-heavy and have come with strict conditions that have been debilitating to the Haitian economy. Grants will ensure that Haiti has the resources to rebuild its public sector and provide its citizens with basic public services to support its economic restoration. </span><u>As</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Nicole Lee, </span><u>executive director of TransAfrica Forum, has noted: &quot;Haiti is poor because it was made poor.&quot; From its inception through the present, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Haiti's development has been </span>stunted and <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">plagued by</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> debt and </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">destructive</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> economic </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">policies implemented by</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> France, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">the U.S</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and institutions such as the IMF and the World Bank. </span><u>The historical and continuous destabilization of Haiti, led by the U.S.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and Western powers, </span><u>is evidenced in policies that have affected all facets of Haitian economic life</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Haiti has more international nongovernmental organizations, per capita, than any other country. However, if Haiti is to be truly independent and prosperous, it is Haitian grass-roots organizations and NGOs that need to be bolstered. The focus should be on capacity building, as well as supporting the sovereignty of a democratically elected Haitian government and the will of the people. In the distribution of the $100 million that the Obama administration has issued, the larger percentage should be going to the local NGO's. These organizations are intricately woven into the social, economic and political fabric of Haitian society and intimately understand how to address the short-term and long-term needs of the people. </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">The U.S. has a <strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">moral obligation</span></strong> to assist its</span> close <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">neighbor</span> in the recovery from and development after this disastrous earthquake. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">It</span> also <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">has a unique opportunity to turn a new page in history, where the people are prioritized over profit</span> and Haitian self-determination and sovereignty are honored and respected</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span></em><br />

These realities, as much as direct political repression under dictatorship or coup regimes, necessarily also have led many Haitians to try to leave their home. And yet </span><u>the U.S</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. state has persisted in defining Haitians as &quot;economic&quot; rather than &quot;political&quot; refugees (such as those from Cuba, to cite one notorious example of a </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">blatant double standard</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">), and </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">has</span></u> <u>for decades <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">consistently violated international law</span></strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;"> by denying Haitians sanctuary and</span> instead <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">forcibly returning them</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">This is part of a long-term</span></u> <u>and appalling <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">pattern of discrimination against Haitians</span> under U.S. immigration policy.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Michael Clemens of the Center for Global Development points out that </span><u>the U.S. officially absorbs approximately <strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">1 million permanent immigrants annually</span></strong></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> from around the world. Despite the xenophobia of chauvinists, there is plenty of evidence that immigration brings economic as well as social and cultural benefits to the U.S. Indeed, the U.S. often portrays itself as a melting pot of immigrants in search of freedom and prosperity. </span><u>And yet, only about 21,000 Haitian immigrants on average are legally admitted into the U.S. each year</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, mostly those with a relative here already. Between 1982 and 2009, the U.S. Coast Guard stopped and returned more than 114,000 Haitians en route to the United States. During the reign of terror under the coup regime in 1991, 38,000 Haitians fled and sought safety in the U.S.; of those, fewer than 5 percent received asylum, and the rest were repatriated or held in the infamous prison camps at Guantánamo Bay. Even more criminally, U.S. agencies actually gave names and addresses to coup leaders of some of those who had attempted to flee, guaranteeing arrest, torture and execution for thousands. Since 2001, </span><u>official <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">policy and practice have</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> actually </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">become</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> even </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">harsher</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.

U.S. CONTINUES TO TREAT HAITIANS LIKE CRIMINALS</span> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Even in the wake of</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> what is generally acknowledged to be among </span><u>the worst <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">catastrophe</span>s in human history, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">the U.S. <strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">continues to treat Haitians like criminals</span></strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Navy and Coast Guard vessels are circling Haiti, not to rescue survivors, but to capture and return anyone trying to escape. Hilary Clinton was quick to declare: &quot;Our ordinary and regular immigration laws will apply going forward, which means that we are not going to be accepting into the United States Haitians who are attempting to make it to our shores. They will be interdicted. They will be repatriated.&quot; The federal government responded to the earthquake by freeing up space in the Krome detention center outside of Miami. And a tent city has been erected at Guantánamo Bay, the Miami Herald reports, &quot;in case waves of Haitians leave their homeland and are captured at sea, said Navy Rear Adm. Thomas Copeman.&quot; A U.S. Air Force plane has been transmitting a message from Raymond Joseph, Haiti's ambassador to the U.S., in Kreyòl across Haiti, the New York Times reported. &quot;Listen, don't rush on boats to leave the country,&quot; Mr. Joseph says, according to a transcript released by the Pentagon. &quot;If you do that, we'll all have even worse problems. Because, I'll be honest with you: If you think you will reach the U.S. and all the doors will be wide open to you, that's not at all the case. And they will intercept you right on the water and send you back home where you came from.&quot; The </span><u>Obama</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> administration </span><u>has made much of</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> its suspension of deportations and the extension of Temporary Protected Status (</span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">TPS</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">) to potentially 125,000 undocumented Haitians in the U.S., which would halt their deportation and allow them to engage in wage labor.</span> <u>But this <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">is only for 18 months. And the application process for TPS is designed to exclude many, and is <strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">absurdly Orwellian</span></strong></span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">-- for example, </span><u>applicants have to prove indigence, and yet the application process is estimated to cost $470.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">For anyone who believes that the Haitians who ordinarily end up in the Krome detention center are &quot;illegal&quot; and therefore criminal, I recommend that they read Edwidge Danticat's moving autobiographical work Brother I'm Dying. In it, she tells the story of her Uncle Joseph, persecuted under the Duvaliers, but determined to stay in his Haitian home that he loved, though finally driven out by threats to his life. Against all odds, he made it to Miami to appeal for asylum, but this 81 year-old cancer survivor was thrown into detention at Krome, and died shortly after. The stories of those Haitians who face deportation due to a past criminal record are often just as wrenching. Like that of Jean Montrevil, who came to the U.S. from Haiti as a teenager with a green card, ran into trouble and was convicted of possession of cocaine. He did 11 years in jail, and turned his life around: he started a business, married a U.S. citizen, became a parent of four U.S. citizen children. He became a model tax-paying citizen, in other words. But due to that past conviction, he was under an immigration supervision program, and at a routine visit--which he voluntarily attended--he was imprisoned and told he would be deported. These are the human faces of the policy Hilary Clinton publicly announces as if it is something to be proud of. BLOCKING EMERGENCY MEDICAL CARE The U.S. government is even blocking emergency medical care for severely injured Haitians. The Department of Homeland Security has said that only 34 people have been granted humanitarian parole, which would make them eligible to enter the U.S. and qualify for Medicaid, on medical grounds. And evacuations to American hospitals were halted for several days while the federal and state governments and the hospitals bickered over who would pay.</span> <u>How can the U.S. government continue to present itself as a generous source of aid and relief,</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">when it continues to bleed the country dry </span><u>while treating its inhabitants as criminals</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">?</span> <u>In order to extend genuine solidarity to Haitians as they struggle against all odds</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, we must support relief efforts run by accountable groups based in Haiti and run by Haitians already on the ground, not to the Red Cross or the Bush/Clinton fund.</span> <u>We must not forget Haiti when the stories drop off the front pages and prime time news</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, which is already starting to happen. And most importantly, </span><u>we have to organize to change the twisted priorities that are doing so much harm, imposed by our government in our name.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">We should call on our government to cancel Haiti's debt: totally, unconditionally and immediately. </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">We should</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;"> also <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">call for a permanent halt to</span> deportations and the practice of <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">forcibly returning Haitians seeking refuge, and to extend amnesty to Haitians already here</span> but without legal status</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Those who doubt that political activism can have an impact can take heart from the fact that Jean Montrevil was released from prison as a direct result of a protest campaign that grew up around his case. Amy Goodman of Democracy Now summed it up: &quot;Grassroots and church groups in New York City demanded freedom for Jean Montrevil, and he was released. It is that kind of </span><u>solidarity</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> that is </span><u>now needed by millions of Haitians, here and in Haiti, suffering the <strong>greatest catastrophe in their history</strong></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.&quot; (IDN-InDepthNews/06.02.2010)</span></span></em><br />

<em>Second, <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Obama rightly argues that</span></u> “America – in fact, <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">no nation – can insist that others follow the rules of the road if we refuse to follow them ourselves</span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">.</span>” He then supports this affirmation by saying that “when we don’t, our actions appear arbitrary and undercut the legitimacy of future interventions, no matter how justified.” Such legitimacy becomes particularly important, he adds, “when the purpose of military action extends beyond self-defense of one nation against an aggressor.” He states that the use of force “can be justified on humanitarian grounds, as it was in the Balkans, or in other places that have been scarred by war.” While this is the US view and state practice may be in flux, the question of unilateral humanitarian intervention without the consent of the territorial state remains a serious issue, and one for continuing conversation. <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Obama understands the principle of reciprocity on which international law is based</span></u>, but he has not resolved the contradiction between the unilateralism of proponents of just war theory and the constraints imposed by international law and institutions on the use of force.

<em>The new politics of international relations require us, therefore, to go beyond the anti-imperialism of the intellectual left as well as of the semi-anarchist traditions of the academic discipline. We need to recognize three fundamental truths. First, in the twenty-first century people struggling for democratic liberties across the nonWestern world are likely to make constant demands on our solidarity. Courageous academics, students and other intellectuals will be in the forefront of these movements. They deserve the unstinting support of intellectuals in the West. Second, the old international thinking in which democratic movements are seen as purely internal to states no longer carries conviction—despite the lingering nostalgia for it on both the American right and the anti-American left. <u>The idea that global principles can and should be enforced worldwide is firmly established in the minds of hundreds of millions of people</u>. This consciousness will become a powerful force in the coming decades. Third, global state-formation is a fact. <u>International institutions are being extended, and (like it or not) they have a symbiotic relation with the major centre of state power</u>, the increasingly internationalized Western conglomerate<u>. The <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">success of the global-democratic revolutionary wave depends</span></u> first <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">on</span></u> how well it is consolidated in each national context—but second, on <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">how thoroughly it is embedded in international networks of power, at the centre of which</span></u><u>, inescapably, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">is the West</span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">. </span>From these political fundamentals, strategic propositions can be derived. First, democratic movements cannot regard non-governmental organizations and civil society as ends in themselves. They must aim to civilize local states, rendering them open, accountable and pluralistic, and curtail the arbitrary and violent exercise of power. Second, democratizing local states is not a separate task from integrating them into global and often Western-centred networks. Reproducing isolated local centres of power carries with it classic dangers of states as centres of war.84 <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Embedding global norms</span></u> <u>and integrating new state centres <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">with global institutional frameworks are essential to the control of violence</span></u>. (To put this another way: the proliferation of purely national democracies is not a recipe for peace.) Third, while the global revolution cannot do without the West and the UN, neither can it rely on them unconditionally. We need these power networks, but we need to tame them too, to make their messy bureaucracies enormously more accountable and sensitive to the needs of society worldwide. This will involve the kind of ‘cosmopolitan democracy’argued for by David Held.85 It will also require us to advance a global social-democratic agenda, to address the literally catastrophic scale of world social inequalities. This is not a separate problem: social and economic reform is an essential ingredient of alternatives to warlike and genocidal power; these feed off and reinforce corrupt and criminal political economies. Fourth, if we need the global-Western state, <u>if <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">we want to</span></u> democratize it and <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">make</span></u> its <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">institutions friendlier to global peace and justice</span></u><u>, we cannot be indifferent to its strategic debates. It matters to develop international political interventions,</u> legal institutions and robust peacekeeping <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">as strategic alternatives to bombing our way through</span></u> <u>zones of <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">crisis</span></u>. It matters that international intervention supports pluralist structures, rather than ratifying Bosnia-style apartheid.86 As political intellectuals in the West, we need to have our eyes on the ball at our feet, but we also need to raise them to the horizon. We need to grasp the historic drama that is transforming worldwide relationships between people and state,as well as between state and state. We need to think about how the turbulence of the global revolution can be consolidated in democratic, pluralist, international networks of both social relations and state authority. We cannot be simply optimistic about this prospect. Sadly, it will require repeated violent political crises to push Western and other governments towards the required restructuring of world institutions.87 What I have outlined is a huge challenge; but <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">the alternative is to see the global revolution splutter into partial defeat, or degenerate into new genocidal wars—perhaps even nuclear conflicts</span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">.</span> The practical challenge for all concerned citizens, and the theoretical and analytical challenges for students of international relations and politics, are intertwined. Continues: (footnote 86) 86 Likewise, <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">the internal politics of Western elites matter</span></u><u>. It makes a difference to halt the regression to isolationist nationalism in American politics</u>. It matters that the European Union should develop into a democratic polity with a globally responsible direction. It matters that the British state, still a pivot of the Western system of power, stays in the hands of outward-looking new social democrats rather than inward-looking old conservatives.</em><br />

<br />
<em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Immigrants from Haiti: Visas and Detentions By the end of last February, 31,000 people, including 7,200 foreign nationals, had been evacuated from Haiti to the United States. However, as of May, only approximately 1,700 Haitian citizens had received Humanitarian Parole. </span><u>A series of <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">restrictive practices stand <strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">in contrast to the open arms</span></strong> extended to Cubans</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, who continue to benefit under the CAA and from a high number of family connections. The U.S. government set the 2010 admissions ceiling for refugees from Latin America and the Caribbean at 5,000. So far, 3,351 out of 3,429 resettled have been Cuban refugees. </span><u>Considering the deplorable conditions <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Haitians</span> currently face, their comparatively <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">low acceptance is <strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">disconcerting</span></strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Furthermore, </span><u>it creates a looming gap between evacuation and immigrant reception</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> that tends to be filled through existing loop holes and illegal smuggling networks. Instead of Humanitarian Parole, the remaining official number of Haitian evacuees have received tourist visas. The drawback of tourist visas is that they prohibit legal employment in the U.S., likely leading to extended illegal residence and labor. These prospects put tourist visa holders at higher risk of detention. Furthermore, many Haitians have once again resorted to illegal means of immigration, boarding boats to reach U.S. shores. Some U.S. officials seem to negate the link between such unlawful processes and the government’s limited immigration response. In January 2010, immediately following the Haiti earthquake, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton confirmed, “Our ordinary and regular immigration laws will apply going forward, which means that we are not going to be accepting into the United States Haitians who are attempting to make it to our shores. They will be interdicted. They will be repatriated.” This approach seems simple, but there is one caveat: deportations to Haiti have been at a stand-still ever since the earthquake, and the U.S. government has yet to name a date for their reinstatement. To make matters worse, </span><u>U<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">.S. immigration law contains no restrictions on the amount of time</span> that suspected <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">illegal immigrants</span> and asylum seekers <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">may be held in detention</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Though </span><u>U.S. detention policies</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> have always been in place, they </span><u>were strengthened following</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the </span><u>September 11th</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> terrorist attacks. On April 17, 2003, </span><u>the Attorney General ruled that</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) </span><u>judges should take national security into account when deciding on bonds for detained immigrants</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> demanding release. The </span><u>Bush</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Administration </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">justified this claim on the basis that terrorists could pose as Haitians</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> seeking asylum. </span><u>Cuban migrants have not been singled out in the same manner</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and many critics believe the term “national security” is employed too arbitrarily as justification for this practice. </span><u>Such <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">ambiguity results in the unnecessary detention of many Haitian migrants</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> without proof of their being a danger to this country. Moreover, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">prison-like conditions, such as physical restraint, lack of medical attention, and</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> occasional </span><u>physical and verbal <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">abuse</span> in these centers <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">are not in line with</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> ICE regulations or </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">international human rights standards</span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-size: 8pt;">.</span> <u>Several Haitian migrants were placed in detention centers following the earthquake</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. An April 1, 2010 </span></em>New York Times <em>article discusses a specific case where thirty Haitians had remained in detention for over two months at the Broward County Transitional Center, an immigration jail in Florida. Marines directed these detainees onto military planes amid the chaos that erupted following the earthquake. Advocates who fought for their release contended, “There is no reason to spend taxpayer dollars detaining traumatized earthquake survivors who cannot be deported and who have demonstrated that they are neither a flight risk nor danger to the community.” TPS: Complications and Concerns <u>Detention is not a fear limited to would-be emigrating Haitians</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><strong><u>The <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">crackdown</span> of</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (</span><strong><u>ICE</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">) has been felt throughout the country’s immigrant community, </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">prevent</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">ing many </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">eligible Haitians</span></u></strong> <strong><u>in the U.S. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">from applying for TPS</span></u></strong><strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">.</span></strong> <u>The U.S. government has granted TPS to Haitians in the U.S. until July 22</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, 2011. </span><u>Technically, this option is open to all Haitian nationals</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> who were already in the U.S. prior to the earthquake, </span><u>regardless of their current immigration status</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>As of June 3</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, 2010, Alejandro Mayorkas, </span><u>head of USCIS, received 52,000 Haitian TPS applications, lower than the expected number</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Representatives of both University of Miami Law School and the law firm of Hunton and Williams requested that the agency issue a statement assuring Haitians they would not be referred to ICE or asked to appear in court due to their status. USCIS responded that laws of motions to appear in court (MTA) vary by state, making the issuance of such a statement impractical. </span><u>Lawyers</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> also </span><u>continue to face a number of hurdles in trying to help Haitians file TPS applications</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. For example, </span><u>fees</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> ranging from a total of $50 to $390 </span><u>are difficult for many eligible applicants to provide. Birth certificates</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">of applicants’ parents </span><u>have</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> also </span><u>been required</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> to verify Haitian nationality. </span><u>These documents are often nearly impossible to obtain</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> after the earthquake’s vast destruction. The current deadline for filing TPS applications is July 20, 2010. Due to complaints concerning the application process, the U.S. government is considering an extension of this deadline. Why Preferential Treatment? Politics and Race Arguably, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Haitians receive a much colder welcome in the United States</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> than Cubans. Cubans who are fleeing their island and breaking with a communist regime are in much better shape and generally considered deserving of asylum. If they reach U.S. territory successfully (either by boat or crossing the Mexican border) they receive refugee status and subsequently become LPRs. Critics argue that Washington rationalizes this immigration policy as serving a long-standing national political interest in accordance with the goals of the Cuban-American Lobby. Some suggest that Cubans’ special status serves as a purported blow against the Castro government. Another explanation for this discriminatory treatment comes from Haiti’s lower average level of education. This initial disadvantage creates apprehension amongst Americans about Haitians’ ability to support themselves and contribute to U.S. society. Although Cuban immigrants still face some discrimination, they come from a nation with a 99.8% literacy rate and are thus perceived as less of a potential burden. Some critics even contend that </span><u>preferential treatment bestowed upon Cuban refugees is <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">an example of a <strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">double standard</span></strong> on the basis of <strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">race</span></strong></span>.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> TransAfrica, </span><u>NAACP and the C</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">ongressional </span><u>B</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">lack </span><u>C</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">aucus </span><u>released a</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">n amicus curiae </span><u>brief designating <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">U.S.</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> interdiction </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">policy </span></u><u>as <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">discriminatory</span></strong> and further arguing that <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Haitians were subject to “<strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">separate and unequal</span></strong>” treatment</span>.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The United States cannot continue to justify differences in immigration practices developed toward Haitians and Cubans. While the Cold War clearly ended twenty years ago, the Haiti earthquake has put the country in a state of emergency. Current U.S. policy, however, promotes dangerous travel attempts to enter the U.S. and continues to fuel an unproductive Cold War mentality that is the product of the Cuban-American lobby attempting to garner special treatment for its cause. Looking Ahead: Environmental Reasons for Concern Although the USCIS is considering an extension of the July 20th </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">TPS</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> deadline for Haitians, such </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">small modifications</span></u></strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;"> emphasize the need for large-scale adjustment</span></u><u>s</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>Both TPS and Humanitarian Parole provided for Haitians are temporary emergency measures, while Cubans benefit from a standardized, annual quota</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> set for refugees fearing persecution. Not only does </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">the <strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">limited scope</span></strong> of these visas continue the U.S.’s long standing bias against Haitian immigrants</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">; it also serves as an example of insufficient responses to natural disasters on a global scale. Tragic and unfair situations resembling the Haiti earthquake’s aftermath are becoming increasingly common in light of environmental dangers. In 2005, A United Nations group warned of the increasing number of “environmental refugees” that would soon need relocation around the world due to climate change. A 2009 article of the World Resources Institute points to the Carteret Islands as the first case of land deemed uninhabitable due to continuous flooding. Its residents are now relocating to nearby Papua New Guinea. Factual and scientific evidence points to rising sea levels and increased hurricanes. These are both migration drivers that transcend political and economic boundaries that have influenced Washington’s biased treatment of Haitians and Cubans. Further large-scale relocations due to natural disasters must be permanently accounted for in future immigration policy, both in the U.S. and around the world. </span></em><br />

<em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">After the devastating earthquake that has leveled Port-au-Prince and led to the deaths of tens of thousands, the </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Obama</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> administration </span><u>has taken the</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> extraordinary </span><u>step of <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">offering temporary protected status</span> to illegal immigrants from Haiti</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The logic behind the decision is compelling. However strongly one might object to the fact that well over 100,000 Haitians are living illegally in the United States, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">deporting them</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> now </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">would be <strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">worse than cruel</span></strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Plagued by violence and poverty for most of its history, </span><u>Haiti has been brought to the edge of anarchy. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Sending Haitian workers home isn't exactly a death sentence. But it is troublingly close</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">T</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">emporary </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">p</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">rotected </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">s</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">tatus </span><u>is meant to <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">last 18 months</span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-size: 8pt;">,</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> during which time we can hope that some semblance of order will be restored. </span><u>Even then</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, however</span><u>, it's not clear that the Haitians who've been given a reprieve will be able to find decent jobs</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> at home, </span><u>let alone the kind of jobs that will allow them to support</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">large extended</span> <u>families</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Mark Schneider and Bernice Robertson of the International Crisis Group have argued that </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">recovering from the earthquake will take at least a decade</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of intense effort. Somehow, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Haitians</span> living in the U</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">nited </span><u>S</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">tates, and the over 9 million Haitians at home forced to endure lawless chaos before and after the earthquake, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">will have to find a more <strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">lasting solution</span></strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. There is something about the power of grisly televised images that brings out the best in Americans. The United States government has performed admirably in Haiti so far, just as it did during the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and the 2005 Kashmir earthquake. Yet there are miserable corners of the world where cameras and correspondents are few and far between, and Haiti has been one of them for at least the past 15 years. </span><u>Many have</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> already </span><u>said that <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">America's callous indifference</span></strong> to Haiti's</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> slow-motion </span><u>collapse</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">over this long and painful period </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">is a national embarrassment</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Given the deep problems that Haiti faces, however, it's not clear what the United States could have done that would have proven more effective than Bill Clinton's 1994 humanitarian intervention, which, like so many armed interventions, ended in failure and retreat. Perhaps </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">the best thing we could do is</span> go beyond t</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">emporary </span><u>p</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">rotected </span><u>s</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">tatus and, working in concert with the European Union and other affluent countries and regions, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">give Haitians an opportunity to build a better life</span> elsewhere</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In 2008, economists Michael Clemens and Lant Pritchett, both affiliated with the highly innovative Center for Global Development, published &quot;Income per Natural: Measuring Development as if People Mattered More Than Places.&quot; Rather than measure a country's GDP per resident, they devised a new statistic called </span></em>income per natural<em>, &quot;the mean annual income of persons born in a given country,&quot; including migrants who've left their native country in search of economic opportunity. So while the American-born Johnny Depp doesn't contribute to U.S. GDP per resident while residing in France, he does bump up its income per natural. As you might expect, poverty levels look very different for national residents and naturals, and the authors offer Haiti as a prime example. Clemens and Pritchett argue that income per natural demonstrates the tremendous power of international migration as a poverty-fighting tool. Moving from one country to another can dramatically improve your life chances, even without expensive investments in education. Incredibly, over a quarter of Haitian naturals who live on more than $2 a day, a global measure of extreme poverty, live in the United States. It is hardly surprising that thousands of Haitians risk their lives to settle in the United States and the Dominican Republic and many other countries besides. There are literally dozens of countries across the world that are what Pritchett, in his provocative book</em> Let Their People Come<em>, calls &quot;zombies.&quot; In the Old West, cities abandoned when the local gold mine dried up were called &quot;ghost towns.&quot; Zombies are essentially ghost towns that you can never leave. The economic opportunities are all gone, but barriers to migration are just high enough that people are forced to stay put, almost as though they were walled in a penitentiary. <u>Though we all want to believe that <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Haiti</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and countries like it </span><u>can eventually become as rich as successful as the U.S.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> or South Korea or Botswana, </span><u>the sad fact is that some countries <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">have been handed a raw deal by</span></u> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">virtue of</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> climate, resources, and </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">the <strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">scarring effects of a cruel colonial history</span></strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. It is possible that Haiti can't be saved. </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">But that doesn't mean that Haitians can't save themselves, provided we start breaking down the walls</span> that have kept them hemmed in.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">It should go without saying that the United States will not offer temporary protected status to illegal immigrants from every country in the world plagued by poverty and violence. The demand for the opportunity to work in the United States is overwhelming, and the economic downturn has not put Americans in a generous mood. But </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">if we're serious about helping Haitians, we have to do something more than text $5</span> to the relief effort.</u></em><br />
<em><strong>Immigration exclusion is an <u>integral part</u> of US racial discrimination. The <u>stigmatization</u> must be accounted for</strong></em><br />

<em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Assuming that under the plenary power doctrine noncitizens possess few, if any, constitutional protections with respect to entering the country, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">the implications of racial</span> and national origin <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">exclusions on citizens must be considered</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Because the Constitution unquestionably protects the rights of citizens, citizens claiming injury have a better chance at successfully challenging the immigration laws than noncitizens directly affected by their operation. Courts have recognized that citizens in certain circumstances may challenge the lawfulness of immigration laws because of the impact on their rights. Gerald </span><u>Rosberg focuses on the damage to U.S. citizens sharing the race or national origin of groups barred from joining the national community</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">: [</span><u>A <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">racial</span> or national origin] <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">classification would ... require <strong>strict scrutiny</strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, not because of the injury to the aliens denied admission, but rather </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">because of the injury to </span>American citizens of <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">the </span>same <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">race</span> or national origin <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">who are <strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">stigmatized</span></strong> by the classification</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>When Congress declares that aliens</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of Chinese or Irish or Polish origin </span><u>are excludable on the grounds of ancestry alone, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">it fixes a <strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">badge of opprobrium</span></strong> on citizens of the same ancestry</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.... Except when necessary to protect a compelling interest, </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">Congress cannot implement a policy that has the effect of labeling</span></u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">some group of</span> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">citizens as inferior</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">to others </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">because of their race</span> or national origin</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Others also have observed the impacts of racial and national origin exclusions on citizens. In vetoing the INA, President Truman observed that the national origins quota system was founded on the idea that Americans with English or Irish names were better people and better citizens than Americans with Italian or Greek or Polish names. It was thought that people of West European origin made better citizens than Rumanians or Yugoslavs or Ukrainians or Hungarians or Balts or Austrians. Such a concept ... violates the great political doctrine of the Declaration of Independence that &quot;all men are created equal.&quot; Similarly, in arguing for the abolition of the quota system, Secretary of State Dean Rusk recognized that excluding certain noncitizens suggested that &quot;'we think ... less well of our own citizens of those national origins, than of other citizens.&quot;' </span><u>Brown</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> v. Board of Education </span><u>suggests that <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">racial</span> and national origin <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">exclusions in the immigration laws adversely affect domestic minorities</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In that case, the Supreme Court relied on </span><u>social science studies document</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">ing </span><u>the fact that <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">segregation</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of African Americans &quot;</span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">generates a feeling of inferiority</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> as to their status in the community </span><u>that</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> may </span><u>affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikely to be undone</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.&quot; Similarly, </span><u>exclusion</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> from the country </span><u>of immigrants</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of color may well &quot;</span><u>generate</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">[] </span><u>a feeling of inferiority</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> as to the[] status in the community&quot; of domestic minorities who share a similar racial and national origin background. </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Racial exclusion</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of noncitizens </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">under the immigration laws</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, be they express or covert, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">reveals to domestic minorities how they are viewed by society</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The unprecedented efforts to seal the U.S.-Mexico border combined with the increased efforts to deport undocumented Mexicans, for example, tell much about how a majority of society views Mexican Americans and suggests to what lengths society might go, if permitted under color of law, to rid itself of domestic Mexican Americans. In fact, during the New Deal, Mexican American citizens, as well as Mexican immigrants, were &quot;repatriated&quot; to Mexico. It therefore is no surprise that the organized Mexican American community consistently resists the harsh attacks on immigration and immigrants. This is true despite sentiment among some Mexican Americans to restrict immigration because of perceived competition with immigrants in the job market. For similar reasons, </span><u>African American <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">activist organizations protest</span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-size: 8pt;">ed </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">when the U.S.</span> Government <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">act</span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-size: 8pt;">ed </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">ruthlessly toward poor Haitian refugees</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> facing death from the political violence gripping Haiti. Asian activist groups criticized the treatment of Chinese immigrants in the 1990s, as well as anti-immigrant sentiment and welfare reforms that adversely affected the Asian immigrant community. These minority groups implicitly understand the link between racial exclusions and their place in the racial hierarchy in the United States. It is not just that they share a common ancestry, though that no doubt plays some role in the formulation of political support. </span><u>These communities instead understand that <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">animosity toward members of immigrant minority communities is not just limited to immigrants</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In this way, </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">immigration has proven to be a battlefield for status</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> among Anglos and people of color in the United States. The concerns of minority activists find support in psychological theory, which suggests that people generally view persons of national origin ancestries other than their own as fungible. Put differently, in-groups tend to define out-groups as homogeneous. The out-group homogeneity theory helps explain the persistence of racial stereotypes. Many have experienced the homogenizing of racial minorities in crude and obviously false statements about how all certain racial minorities &quot;look alike.&quot; The theory supports the idea that society generally classifies all persons of Mexican ancestry, for example, as the same and fails to make fine legal distinctions between them based on such things as immigration status. In the end, </span><u>we must understand that the impact of <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">racially exclusionary immigration laws does more than just <strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">stigmatize domestic minorities</span></strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Such laws reinforce domestic subordination of</span> the same <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">racial minority groups who are excluded</span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">By barring admission</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of the outsider group that is subordinated domestically</span><u>, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">society rationalizes the disparate treatment of the domestic racial minority group</span> in question <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">and <strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">reinforces that group's inferiority</span></strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Exclusion in the immigration laws must be viewed as an <strong>integral part of</strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> a larger mosaic </span><strong><u>of <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">racial discrimination</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in American society.</span></em><br />
<em><strong>Mutual respect is a “primary good” that society must make available to all. Stigmatization is the <u>dispositive issue</u> that should determine how you vote</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>Nussbaum 04</strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">– Professor of law and ethics @ University of Chicago [Martha C. Nussbaum, <u>Hiding from Humanity: Disgust, Shame and the Law</u>, 2004, pg. 224-226]</span></em><br />
<em><u>What</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, then, </span><u>should</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> these </span><u>issues of stigma, shame, and narcissism mean for public policy</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">? If the only issue we had to deal with were the emotional health of those who stigmatize others, some liberals might insist that law and public policy have no business promoting emotional health by moderating the influence of stigmatizing and branding in citizens' lives. If those &quot;</span><u>normals&quot; are acting out an infantile type of shame, and failing to form relationships of mature interdependency</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, so much the worse for them, such a liberal might say, but that is part of their choice of a way of life, and the law has no business intervening. I think that even such a liberal might be answered, because surely </span><u>the capacities for emotional health, self-respect, and mutually respectful relationships with other citizens <strong>are &quot;primary goods&quot; that</strong></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">it seems reasonable to think any liberal </span><strong><u>society should make available to its citizens</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.3 </span><u>It is clear</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, however, </span><u>that</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the stigmatizers and their mental health are not our only concern. </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">The stigmatized suffer tremendous damage</span> from the stigmatizing behavior</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of others. Sometimes </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">they suffer legal and civil disabilities</span> through no fault of their own</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, as when a minority religion or a minority lifestyle that does no harm to nonconsenting third parties is discriminated against under law. Still more frequently, </span><u>they suffer from pervasive discrimination</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in housing, employment, and other social functions, </span><u>with no legal recourse</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, as has long been the situation of gays and lesbians in most modern societies, along with the short, the fat, the HIV positive, and many others. Almost always, too, individual </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">members of stigmatized groups suffer pain from <strong>mockery</strong></span><strong>, taunting, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">and the assault on their human dignity</span></strong> and individuality that is so intrinsic a part of shaming.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">This being the case, </span><u>any society built on norms of mutual respect and reciprocity has very strong reasons to consider how the harmful impact of stigma can be minimized</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Although political liberals and communitarians differ on many questions, they presumably can agree that </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">mutual respect and reciprocity are extremely important social goods</span>, goods that lie at the heart of the political conception of</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">a liberal democracy such as </span><strong><u>the U</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">nited </span><strong><u>S</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">tates.4 Thus, up to a point at least, we may advance an argument that has some hope of persuading communitarian proponents of greater social homogeneity, as well as political liberals who hold that reasonable disagreement about values is a hallmark of a liberal society. *v\ </span></em>.-i <span style="font-size: 8pt;">x ^ </span><em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">One point should be strongly emphasized from the start: the impact of institutions on child development goes deep. It is crucial not to think of children as if their development takes place in the &quot;private sphere&quot; until they are adult citizens. At every stage, it is affected, for better or worse, by laws and institutions. A society's public norms regarding matters of gender, sexuality, and discrimination affect the lives of parents, hence those of their children, in many different ways. As children mature, these norms affect children more directly. Thus, for example, the norms of masculinity that I have discussed with reference to Chodorow and to Kindlon and Thompson are transmitted by parents and peers to children against the background of social norms and institutions. There are many ways in which laws and institutions can affect these norms: for example, through public education, formal and informal; through policies that give men incentives to participate more fully in child care; and through parental leave and through incentives to employers to create more flexible work policies.5 The creation of a norm of maleness that emphasizes interdependence rather than self-sufficiency is a complex task, involving the participation of institutions in many different aspects of children's and parents' lives, and at many different levels. Thus the specific areas of law that I shall henceforth investigate are but a small and especially obvious part of the terrain to be considered. Our first question concerns the active participation of law in inflicting shame: when, if ever, is this a good thing? It may look pretty obvious that </span><u>the <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">law should not cause citizens degradation or humiliation any more than it should participate in slavery</span></strong>. Even if a citizen wants to be humiliated</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(and even if the preference for humiliation is one that, within certain limits of bodily safety, the law typically respects among consenting adults in personal relationships), </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">for the state to dole out humiliation</span> to the willing customer <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">seems subversive of</span> the very ideas of <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">dignity and equality</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> on which liberal democracy is based. Suppose the law said to its citizens: &quot;Here is a penny. If you give back the penny we will treat you with respect; but you may keep the penny, in which case we will subject you to humiliating treatment.&quot; This offer seems unacceptable, even in a democracy that attaches great value to freedom of choice.6 We do not want to live in a democracy in which people have to pay to be treated with respect— even if the money is trivial and is given to them by the state. </span><u>Respect is a sine qua non of the relationship between the state and its citizens, all of its citizens</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span></em><br />

<em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(NNPA)—For my money </span><u>the <strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">debate</span></strong> over immigration reform is far too narrow</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Our civil rights leaders have followed the predictable dynamic created by Hispanics who have justly mobilized to normalize their status in America. We should support them because </span><u>the stakes of strengthening our coalition at this moment in history will bear substantial fruit</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> as both groups become a larger part of American society, its political system and its economy. So, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">it is a civil rights struggle to oppose</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">the </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">racist law</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> passed by the Arizona legislature to profile Hispanics and relate any illegal acts to their immigration status. Nevertheless, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">it is</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> also </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">a civil rights struggle to</span> <strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">use this moment to finally <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">eliminate the racism in immigration law</span></span></strong></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in general. </span><u>This means that our take on <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">immigration reform should</span> be addressed more clearly and forcibly to <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">creat</span>ing <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">fair opportunities for people of African descent</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> to enter this country along with everyone else. Over the years some progress has been made. For example, the initial quota established in 1924 which allowed 1,100 Africans to enter a year, increased to 1,400 by 1952. After African countries became independent in the 1960s, immigration to the U.S. increased, reaching 40,000 per year by 2000. Between l960 and 2008 African immigration to the U.S. amounted to 1.4 million. Still, this constituted only 3.8 percent of the total foreign population of 38 million in that period. The result of such a restrictive entry policy for Africans has been that largely those with economic resources have been eligible to apply for immigrant status. Thus, while 23 percent of Americans in general have college degrees, 51 percent of African immigrants have college degrees. This has also meant that while the myth of the African cabdriver persist, the real story is that the average wage of Africans is among the highest in the nation second only to Asians. The second generation of African-born immigrants in the U.S. are now prominent in American universities and in many areas of corporate and human service occupations. </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">The situation of Haitian immigrants, long a source of vexation</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> to many, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">was exposed again by the recent hurricane as <strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">blatantly racist</span></strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Some </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Haitians</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> who survived the hurricane and made it to the U.S. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">found </span></span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">themselves locked up in detention centers</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in Miami </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">for the lack of visas</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">This is consistent treatment of Haitians who have been <strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">routinely and vigorously turned away</span></strong></span> from U.S. shores <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">while White Cubans have enjoyed</span> a</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Cold War </span><u>policy that has <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">privileged</span> their <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">immigration</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> to the U.S.. Between 1980 and 2008, total Haitian immigration to the United States was 535,000 but Cuban immigration during that same period was nearly one million. The arrangement for Cuban immigrants was always based on a political fiction because Cuba has been no real threat to the United States, so </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">the</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> comparative </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">treatment of Haitians</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and other Afro-Caribbean </span><u>immigrants <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">must be justified on the basis of a <strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">racial prohibition</span></strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The test is that if Cuban immigrants had been Black instead of White would they have been allowed to come? Apparently, the U.S. was paying no attention to Mexican/Latin American immigration as Latin American immigration in that period constituted 53 percent (32 percent Mexican) of all sources, with over 10 million undocumented people from that region in the country. Meanwhile it paid attention to Haiti, since only 76,000 immigrants were “unauthorized” from Haiti in that same period. </span><u>One of the routes to the stabilization of Haiti in the post-hurricane era would be</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> to allow humanitarian </span><u>immigration</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. How would it look to have satisfied the Latin American dimension of the immigration problem on those grounds while the African dimension of it festers? Generally, I believe that </span><u>there can be no</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> “comprehensive </span><u>immigration” solution that does not take into consideration people of African descent</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">Obama</span></u></strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; font-size: 8pt; padding: 0in;"> administration </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">should</span></u></strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; font-size: 8pt; padding: 0in;"> try to </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">eliminate the racial dimension of immigration policy</span></u></strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-size: 8pt;">,</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> but then it may be banking on not having another problem. But it is also fair to ask why there is no problem created by African-American mobilization on this matter, why no mobilization by African born or Haitian born immigrants? One source of the future expansion of the “African-American” population is by natural birth rates, but another is by immigration, </span><u>to miss this opportunity to elimination racist immigration is to limit the future power of our community.</u></em><br />

<em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">We must let more Haitians come here. In fact, </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">it's time to consider</span></u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">an entire new class of immigration -- call it </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">a</span></u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot;golden door&quot;</span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;"> visa</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, to be issued in limited numbers </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">to people from</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the poorest countries, such as </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Haiti</span></u></strong><strong>.</strong> <u>It could be permanent or temporary, but that's less important than its core purpose</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Our immigration law has traditionally had three primary goals: reuniting families, supplying employers and protecting refugees. But part of America's greatness is that in letting people come, the nation has pursued a fourth, unwritten goal: </span><u>extending opportunity to those born in places without it. A</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> golden door </span><u>visa would simply recognize in law what the United States has done since its founding</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. No human act can blunt the force of an earthquake, but the Haitian people's profound loss was not fundamentally caused by movements of the Earth.</span> <u>The reason that tens of thousands of people are dying in Haiti is</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, put simply, </span><u>because <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Haiti is poor</span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Poverty means shoddy construction materials</span></u><u>, lax enforcement of building codes, abysmal emergency response <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">and low stocks of food and medicine.</span></u> <u>The</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> earthquake shook the ground; the </span><u>catastrophe came because most Haitians are poor and vulnerable</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Why are so many Haitians so vulnerable? Asking why people are poor is different from asking why a country is poor. Some have blamed Haiti's poverty on culture or religion; others cite the country's history of slavery and colonialism; yet others decry government corruption or decades of unfocused foreign aid. There are no simple explanations. The one thing we understand is that Haiti has been destitute and will continue to be so for a long time. We do know, however, why many individual Haitians are poor. For a large number, there is a clear reason: Many have been willing and able to leave Haiti for American shores, but armed agents of the U.S. government have forcibly stopped them or deterred them from trying. If they had not been stopped, virtually none of them would have been as poor and vulnerable as they were on Jan. 12.

The United States has deported only around 1,000 Haitians per year recently, so a brief halt will make a limited difference in who lives where. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton emphasized Thursday that the new policy will not apply to Haitians seeking to come here now. &quot;Our ordinary and regular immigration laws will apply going forward, which means that we are not going to be accepting into the United States Haitians who are attempting to make it to our shores. They will be interdicted. They will be repatriated.&quot; Yet Haitians willing to emigrate today would typically experience vast and immediate increases in their standard of living and security -- a goal the administration no doubt supports. That is why so many have been willing to leave Haiti, braving ocean blockades and other risks, even before the quake. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.uscg.mil/hq/cg5/cg531/AMIO/FlowStats/FY.asp" rel="nofollow">Between 1982 and 2009, the U.S. Coast Guard stopped 114,716 Haitians on their way to the United States</a>, forcing them to go back, and such unsuccessful attempts must certainly have deterred an even larger number from even trying to leave. Last March, 51 percent of Haitians polled told Gallup that, given the opportunity, they would leave their country permanently. I am not suggesting that, if some of these people died in the earthquake, U.S. immigration policy is responsible. But </span><u>it would be</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> just as </span><u>ludicrous to contend that we could not foresee very bad things happening to people forced to live in extreme poverty</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>Life in destitution is a brittle existence. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">There is no extra money to buy good building materials, invest in quality schooling or take preventive health measures</span>.

Katrina prompted one of the <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0912/p01s01-ussc.html" rel="nofollow">biggest resettlements in American history.</a> Who would have blocked Interstate 10 with armed guards, forcing hundreds of thousands of people to suffer in the disaster zone, no matter how much assistance was coming in from outside? We wouldn't have done that, because it would have made us collectively responsible for their continued suffering. Why then, in the thoughtful debate that has emerged over how best to aid Haiti and help its citizens help themselves, are Americans still quiet about this sinister face of our immigration policy? Of course, a natural disaster by itself is not a sufficient reason to eliminate restrictions on the movement of Haitians. International migration has complex effects: It can shape societies, labor markets and electorates. And disasters such as Haiti's earthquake are aggravated by countless political, social and economic forces, in their locales and beyond. But even taken alone, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">U.S. immigration law has a huge impact</span></u> <u>on poor people all over the world</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. We should consider this when debating immigration reform as well as aid and development. Currently, we allow a trickle of about 21,000 Haitian immigrants, on average, to enter the United States legally each year; most of them are able to come only because they are lucky enough to have a relative already here. What evidence do we have that we could not absorb triple that number, or even more? For years, we have been accepting close to 1 million permanent immigrants annually from around the world, with no lasting effects on the earnings of the average American worker. And while most economic studies find that such immigration may have lowered the wages of U.S. high school dropouts by a few percentage points, many of those dropouts are immigrants themselves, already earning far more than they would in their country of origin. A high school dropout in the United States earns an average of $24,000 a year -- about seven times the wages of a typical Haitian worker. Beyond permanent immigrants, 498 Haitians entered the United States in 2008 on temporary seasonal worker visas, known as H-2 visas. Even in a time of economic crisis,</span> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">the gigantic American economy could welcome</span> many times that number of temporary <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Haitian workers</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>Guest workers help our economy grow and recover by giving employers greater flexibility in their hiring and investment decisions</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, particularly in hard-hit sectors such as textiles, transportation and construction. </span><u>Meanwhile, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">those workers would <strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">do more good for themselves and their families than any amount of aid could do for them</span></strong></span>. And people remaining in <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Haiti would benefit enormously</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Haiti already gets close to $2 billion per year -- about a third of its income -- </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">in cash remittances</span></u> <u>from its citizens living abroad</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.

<em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Long before the calamity in Haiti, </span><u>many <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Haitians</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and their families </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">benefit</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">ed </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">from working abroad</span>, and</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">many, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/22/AR2010012202274.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">including me</a>, have suggested</span> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">allowing more Haitian immigrants in</span>to the United States as a way to <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">help the country's economy recover</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. It might seem strange that </span><u>the best solution to Haiti's woes lies outside its borders</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, but </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">migration and remittances have been <strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">responsible for almost all</span></strong> of the poverty reduction</span></u> <u>that has happened in the island country</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">over the past few decades. </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">They have done <strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">enormously more good than any policy</span></strong> intended to reduce poverty</span></u> <u>inside Haiti during that time</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>Any poverty-reduction strategy for Haiti going forward that does not include what has been Haitians' most successful poverty-reduction strategy to date is not a serious one</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. This idea is a no-brainer if we take a minute to look at the numbers. First, Haitians have already emigrated in droves. There are around 535,000 Haitian-born U.S. residents at the Census Bureau's <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.census.gov/acs/www/Products/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">last count</a>, out of roughly 1 million in total living abroad. </span><u>The vast majority of Haitians who have escaped poverty have done so by leaving the country</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>Pick any reasonable poverty line for Haiti; the vast majority of Haitians above it no longer live there</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In a <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cgdev.org/content/publications/detail/15552" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">study</a> I did with Harvard's Lant Pritchett, we chose a bare-bones poverty line of $10 per day (measured as a living standard at U.S. prices). That's total destitution -- just a third of the $30 per day that the United States <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty/09fedreg.shtml" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">considers</a> &quot;poverty&quot; for a single adult. Eight out of 10 Haitians above that line currently live in the United States. Most of this represents the </span></em>effect <em>of emigration on poverty. Only 1 percent of people in Haiti live on more than $10 per day, and there is no evidence that most Haitian emigrants come from the extreme tip-top of the income distribution, so very few people who emigrated would have an income that high if they had been forced to stay home. A typical low-skill male Haitian in the United States earns <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cgdev.org/content/publications/detail/16352" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">at least six times</a> what he could earn in Haiti. And all of this just accounts for Haitians in the United States. Include the roughly 100,000 more who are in Canada and Western Europe, almost all of whom live on over $10 per day, and it's even starker: <u>The vast majority of <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Haitians who escaped poverty did so by leaving</span> Haiti, not as a result of anything that happened in the country.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">What about </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Haitians who did not emigrate</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">? A limited number of these have emerged from poverty, but many </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">were lifted out of poverty by remittances</span></u> <u>from abroad</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>They</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, too, </span><u>should be included in any accounting of the effect of migration on poverty</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Dilip Ratha, </span><u>a top expert on remittances, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://blogs.worldbank.org/peoplemove/helping-haiti-through-migration-and-remittances" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">__estimates__</a> that a full accounting would show that <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Haitians abroad send</span> home $1.5 billion to 1.8 billion per year</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">or higher. </span><u>That <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://blogs.cgdev.org/globaldevelopment/2010/01/haiti-aid-facts.php" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">__is much more__</a> than all the foreign aid that Haiti receives</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The middle of Ratha's range suggests that </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">remittances account for more than one quarter of Haiti's GDP. This is conservatively low because <strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">remittances have a <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplier_%28economics%29" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">__multiplier effect__</a> on local GDP</span></strong></span></u><strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">.</span></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Living standards in Haiti have not improved in the last 30 years. They've gotten much worse. According to the <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://go.worldbank.org/SI5SSGAVZ0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">World Bank</a>, the annual income of the average person in Haiti, measured as a living standard at U.S. prices, steadily </span></em>declined <em>from $2,400 in 1980 to roughly $1,200 just before the earthquake. It is certainly even lower now. <u>The poverty inside Haiti would</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> almost certainly </span><u>be much greater without remittances</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Economist Manuel Orozco <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://isim.georgetown.edu/Publications/RCRCCPubs/Orozco/Understanding%20the%20remittance%20economy%20in%20Haiti.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">has shown</a> that </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">remittances</span></u> <u>to Haiti <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">are</span> primarily <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">spent on</span> the most basic necessities of <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">food, clothing, shelter, and medicine</span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-size: 8pt;">.</span> <u>Because remittances are impossible</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> by definition </span><u>without emigration</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and cover at least a quarter of people's income in Haiti, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">emigration</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> must have </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">substantially reduced poverty</span></u></strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;"> for those back home</span></u><u>.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> What all of these numbers mean is that </span><u>the large majority of all poverty reduction that has occurred for Haitians</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> -- whether outside Haiti or inside Haiti -- </span><u>has been caused by international migration and remittances. <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Foreign aid has had little or nothing to do with it</span></strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">.</span> The numbers do not allow any other reasonable interpretation</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span></em><br />

Instead, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">the United States could <strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">reallocate visas within the current levels</span></strong></span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">to include people from the world's poorest countries who are most in need of opportunities. </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">This <strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">small adjustment</span></strong> to U.S. immigration policy would have a <strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">big impact</span></strong></span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">by improving the lives of poor immigrants and those who remain in their home countries through remittances.</span></em><br />
<em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">We can do a back-of-the-envelope calculation of what additional migration could do. </span><u>Suppose the United States lets in 100,000 Haitian immigrants</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, which is the number that currently arrives over a span of five years. First, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">this would dramatically raise their incomes and raise </span></u><u>essentially <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">all of them out of extreme poverty</span>.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Second, </span><u>this would increase the size of the worldwide Haitian diaspora by 10 percent</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. If the new migrants remit like earlier migrants did, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">this would mean roughly <strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">$150 million</span></strong></span></u> <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; font-size: 8pt; padding: 0in;">to 180 million</span><u><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;"> <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">every year in</span> additional <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">remittances</span> for Haiti</strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (and because things are so much tougher in Haiti now, we could expect new migrants to remit more than migrants have before).

<em><strong>Poverty fuels Haiti defo</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>Sabin 03</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> - Executive Director @ Floresta USA [Scott Sabin, “Opinion Response to Article &quot;Haiti Deforestation Exacerbates Flooding&quot; by Paisley Dodds and Amy Bracken,” <u>Heritagekonpa Magazine</u>, 2003, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.heritagekonpa.com/Caribbean%20Deforestation-%20Haiti%20crisis.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.heritagekonpa.com/Caribbean%20Deforestation-%20Haiti%20crisis.asp</a>]</span></em><br />
<em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The article reinforces this idea. An elderly Haitian peasant, Philis Milfort is quoted as saying, &quot;We know we need trees, but we also need to eat and to cook.&quot; This demonstrates two very important points: 1) </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">defo</span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-size: 8pt;">restation</span> <u>is not based on ignorance, it <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">is based on desperation</span>, and</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> 2) </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">unless you address the <strong>local economy</strong> you will make no headway</span> curbing defo</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">restation. Later the article quotes a charcoal vendor who again demonstrates the vicious cycle: “‘this is the only way I can feed my four kids,’ said Vena Verone […] ‘I've heard about the floods and deforestation that caused them, but there's nothing I can do about that.’&quot; The article mentions importing propane and wood as possible solutions to deforestation and talks about the need for reforestation. Yet importing propane would do nothing for the thousands like Vena Verone, who make their living harvesting and selling firewood and charcoal, except to increase their misery. And </span><u>reforestation without addressing the needs of these only invites more cutting.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Over fifteen years ago, Lester Brown of the Worldwatch Institute wisely observed that &quot;successfully reforesting large areas of degraded lands will require much more than financial commitments . . . Only by garnering the knowledge, support and human energy of rural people themselves -- and planting to meet their basic needs -- is there any hope of success.&quot; (Brown, Lester, R. et al, State of the World, 1988, p. 84.) </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">Poverty and deforestation form a vicious cycle</span></u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">and need to be addressed simultaneously. </span><u>The beauty is that when they are addressed together, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">their solutions become mutually reinforcing</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Microcredit, or the practice of </span><u>making small loans to the <strong>entrepreneurial poor</strong>, gives people</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> like Vena Verone </span><u>the opportunity to start small businesses and is a strong <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">antidote to poverty.</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> With a microcredit loan, Vena Verone can do something else to feed her four kids. </span><u>At the same time it <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">can be a <strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">strong motivator for reforestation</span></strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In Floresta’s program, the poor plant trees as a prerequisite for receiving loans, and </span><u>by using loans to purchase land</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">that they would otherwise have to rent, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">they are much more willing to invest in its long-term health</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>Over time trees provide fruit and wood, protect and restore water sources, and through techniques like agroforestry, improve crop yields</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>Thus</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, in the long term, </span><u>reforestation not only protects communities from flooding but contributes to the wealth of those communities, creating the opposite of a vicious cycle</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span></em><br />
<em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">That is the strategy that Floresta has used to empower poor Haitian and Dominican farmers - the very people who used to say “we know we need trees, but we also need to eat and cook,” - to plant almost two million trees and start hundreds of small businesses. </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Deforestation</span> is not only a serious issue, but one that <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">has a <strong>solution</strong></span></u><strong>.</strong></em><br />

More importantly, </span><u>13 species of frog on the <strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">verge of extinction</span></strong> live only here</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The Alliance for Zero Extinction reports nowhere else on Earth has more than nine such species. However, </span><u>only 2% of <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Haiti’s</span> original <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">forests</span> remain and they <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">are disappearing</span> at a rate of 10% every five years</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, according to a group of conservation groups including BirdLife International and the Zoological Society of London. </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">The forests are being cut down by desperately poor communities</span></u> <u>who chop the trees for firewood</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and then use the land to grow crops, the conservationists said. The Massif de la Hotte region suffered further strain after January’s earthquake when refugees from the capital Port-au-Prince doubled the size of the local population. “</span><u>It’s slash and burn subsistence agriculture</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> that comes at the expense the forest,” said David Wege, of BirdLife International. “</span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">People are just trying to eke out a living</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> by cutting down trees for fuel and charcoal, and then using the land for agriculture. ”A bag of charcoal can fetch US$30, which is a significant economical driver to people earning about US$1 a day. </span><u>The consequences are landslides, mudslides, erosion and flooding. The people know the long term impact but they are just trying to survive</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.” BirdLife International, the Zoological Society of London and Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust recently secured US$450,000 from the UK government’s Darwin Initiative to work with Haitian NGOs, Societe Audubon Haiti and Fondation Macaya, helping local communities find alternative income without destroying the forest. Wege said: “</span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Protecting the environment immediately comes down to helping local people with their livelihoods</span></u><u>, because they are the same people who are impacting the environment</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. ”We need to help people survive better with less impact on the environment, so our involvement has to start at a community level.” Examples of the work in helping reduce the community’s impact on the forest include piping fresh water from natural springs into villages, which saves people from having to cut down trees to reach the springs. The NGOs have also established tree nurseries, growing trees for reforestation and giving employment to local people. Other initiatives include establishing fast-growing wood for fuel around villages, setting up chicken farming cooperatives and reopening the area’s only school, which closed down in 2000 because of lack of funding. Researchers are now starting to study the forest itself to discover where exactly the most endangered species are living, and which patches should be made priorities for reforestation. ”We need to make sure species are not going extinct while are a reforesting somewhere else,” said Wege. ”</span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">The <strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">potential for extinctions there is huge</span></strong></span></u><u>. Because there are lots of little forest patches, any one could be the only place where a specific species lives, and if that goes, so does the species</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. “</span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">The area is <strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">exceptionally high in endemic species</span></strong> that are not found elsewhere</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">: frogs, mammals, plants, reptiles and birds</span><u>. ”There are two endangered species of mammal that are found only on the island</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">: a solenodon, which is like a giant shrew, and a hutia, like a long-legged guinea pig living in trees.”</span></em><br />

<em><u>Just as it may be hard to say which rivet is the critical one, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">ecosystems</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> sometimes </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">have keystone species whose loss can trigger the transformation of the system</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, even if it comes early in the subtraction process. </span><u>But <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">it may be unclear which</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, if any, of the species </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">is</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> a </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">key</span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-size: 8pt;">stone</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In a given ecosystem, </span><u>the endangered species might</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> be unimportant. In another, one might </span><u>be critical</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Species that appear redundant may actually have valuable but undiscovered functions. When the wing goes, it does so suddenly and catastrophically, and heavily stressed ecosystems occasionally do so as well. However, they are more likely to transform from one state to a quite different state that retains some but not all of the original species. Ecosystems can have multiple stable states: in effect, different identities involving different collections of species, different levels of biological productivity, and so on. </span><u>Changes</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> from one state to another, especially if they take place on a large scale and we have come to rely on them in their original state, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">can affect the function and habitability of an ecosystem and</span> thus <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">human well-being</span>.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> If the wing falls off in flight, the damage is irreversible. Putting back the last rivet removed will not reattach the wing. Ecosystems losing species exhibit hysteresis, says Bohlen: &quot;In going from complex to simple you go through one series of community types, but when going from simple to complex you don't retrace those steps. In other words, it may be very easy to go one direction but very hard to go the other.&quot; This has profound implications for the human response to loss of ecosystem function, because </span><u>it is difficult or impossible to reverse the transformation</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Simply restoring the most recently </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">lost species</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> won't necessarily work. If such losses are serious and widespread-as many scientists believe they already are, or will soon be-they </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">could gravely compromise our planetary life-support system</span>.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> At minimum, they would be extremely expensive to restore or replace. (One famous estimate of the value of global ecosystem goods and services, by ecological economist Robert Costanza and colleagues, yielded an estimated range of $18-62 trillion (2001 dollars) per year. The gross world product in 2001 was $47 trillion.</span></em><br />

Thus, rather than violently competing with a nation-state, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">an irregular attacker can criminally co-opt and <strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">seize control of the state</span></strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">51 Additionally, it is important to note that this second level of analysis would include proxies or surrogates of other countries. Many of the “Wars of National Liberation” and “People’s Wars” that were fought all over the world during the so-called Cold War are good examples of this phenomenon. In this context, it is important to note that, at a Forum on Fourth-Generation of Warfare and Asymmetric War, held in Caracas, Venezuela, in early 2004, President Chávez directed the armed forces to develop a new military doctrine for contemporary conflict: “I call upon everybody to start an . . . effort to apprehend . . . the ideas, concepts, and doctrine of asymmetric war.”52 This move has provided the conceptual basis upon which Venezuela might use all available networks—political, economic, social, informational, and military—to convince a targeted government’s decisionmakers and population that their present political situation is not legitimate and is hopeless. The development of doctrine for conduct of contemporary asymmetric war—and the accompanying publicity—was also intended to be a clear signal to the rest of Latin America and the United States that it would be only a matter of time before the Bolivarian Revolution (bolivarianismo) prevails.53 The corollary, again, has to do with the general possibility of Venezuela helping to destabilize selected parts of Latin America by funneling money and other support to various nonstate actors. More specifically, one should consider the ramifications for stability and security, given the possibility of Venezuelan money, technology, and arms being provided to radical movements and insurgent groups throughout Central and South America. Probably the most salient example of regional destabilization would be the possibility of Venezuelan support to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) in Colombia. And the question that plagued the West and its relations with the Soviet Union and China during the Cold War and continues into this contemporary situation is, “How to respond to a country that might be helping to change others through revolutionary means?” Also, “How to respond to a country that is helping legal political parties or movements—such as Nicaraguan Sandinistas and Bolivian and Ecuadorian populists—that are operating in democracies?” A closely associated question is, “What are the most effective means to help a country targeted for bolivarianismo to resist the revolutionary appeal?” The implications at this second level of analysis are daunting. Given the interrelated, multidimensional, multiorganizational, and multinational nature of contemporary conflict, security and stability are too big and too important to remain relegated either to the military or the police of a single nation. It is a nation-state problem, and must be addressed in a unified manner by all the instruments of state power. At the same time, most subnational threats to security and sovereignty are supported by transnational actions. Transnational threats require transnational (multilateral) responses. Thus, a targeted nation’s security and stability are also <strong>problems for</strong> the regional and <strong>global communities</strong>. Another highly relevant question concerning hemispheric security is, “How can the nation-state and the multilateral community, together, generate a combination of military, law enforcement, intelligence, legal, informational, and moral capabilities adequate to combat contemporary asymmetric, fourth-generation threats?” The Third Level. The third level of analysis involves the personal security and well-being of the individual citizen. It then extends to protection of the entire population from violent, internal nonstate actors and external enemies—and, perhaps in some cases, from repressive internal (local and regional) governments. The individual security problem ends with the establishment of perceived firm but fair control of the entire national territory and the people in it. In these terms, it is helpful to think of human perpetrators of insecurity and violence as tertiary threats to individual security. Root causes— poverty; lack of basic human services; and corrupt, underperforming, or nonexistent government security institutions within the national territory—must be recognized as secondary threats. The inability or unwillingness of government to address secondary and tertiary threats must be understood as the primary (the most fundamental) threat. As a result, strategic planners and decisionmakers must contemplate all the levels of threat in dealing with individual security matters.54 The corollary takes us back to the problems of assessing democracy and nonintervention, as well as subnational, national, and regional instability in Venezuela and throughout the Latin American region. Associated questions involve the circular nature of the interdependent relationships among personal and collective security, stability, development, peace, prosperity, and democracy, and, “How to respond to these core human issues?” In the context of the Latin American security dialogue, the most important implication of the third-level personal security component of the contemporary conflict spectrum is the issue of achieving a balanced socioeconomic development with freedom and security. Experience throughout the world and over time clearly indicates that the inability or unwillingness of a government to perform its fundamental governance and personal security functions leads to failing or failed state status.55 Clearly, many of the problems integral to the failing state process have their origins in weak or inadequate institutions that result in poor or thuggish responses to issues ranging from poverty to street gangs to organized crime. Thus, the question here is, “How to strengthen state institutions as they attempt perform their legitimate governance and security functions?” The Fourth Level. Finally, at the fourth global level of analysis, much of the international community is involved in securing the benefits of global integration. The keys to those benefits are security and stability. A multipolar world in which one or a hundred state and nonstate actors are exerting differing types and levels of power within a set of cross-cutting alliances is volatile and dangerous. As a consequence, the countries and peoples that expect the benefits of global stability must understand and cope with the threats imposed by the new global security environment, think outside the proverbial hemispheric “box,” and make a contribution—however small—to world stability. At the same time, President Chávez’s approach to Latin American security and stability requires a realignment from capitalist and “neo-liberal” economics and politics to his socialism for the 21st century. That realignment will likely generate instability, conflict, and probably exacerbate the processes of state failure in important parts of the hemisphere. Thus, the corollary at this level must address questions associated with “peacekeeping,” “stability operations,” “nation-building,” and “state failure.” The implications are straightforward. In the contemporary security environment, international organizations such as the UN and the OAS, and individual national powers, increasingly are being called on to respond to conflict generated by all kinds of material instabilities and human destabilizers. Likewise, the global community increasingly is being asked to respond to failing and failed states. In these terms, it is important to remember that state failure is a process, not an outcome. It is a process by which a state loses the capacity and/or the will to perform its essential legitimizing governance and security functions. In either case, the associated question is “How should the processes of state failure be addressed before they run their courses and achieve conflict and/or crisis proportions?” Conclusions from the Four Levels of Analysis. Chávez understands that every player in the international community from small powers to the U.S. superpower must cope simultaneously with four separate and potentially grave types of contemporary threat. These threats include, first, traditional and lingering boundary and territorial disputes, as well as balance of power concerns. Second, each protagonist must deal with the very real possibility that transnational and internal nonstate actors can be used by one nation-state to play serious roles in destabilizing and taking down another. Additionally, destabilizing nontraditional internal public and personal security threats can been seen all over the hemisphere in ungoverned territories, urban criminal gangs, more conventional terrorism, and insurgency. At the same time, real threats to effective sovereignty exist, stemming from chronic poverty, disease, and other “root causes” of conflict. Accordingly, all of the above types of threats are seen as methods of choice—or areas for exploitation—for various commercial (narco-traffickers and organized criminals), ideological (insurgencies such as Peru’s Sendero Luminoso) movements, and caudillos like Chávez who are completely and ruthlessly dedicated to achieving control or radical change in a given nation-state. Nevertheless, rather than considering each level of conflict as an independent form of warfare, Chávez finds that it is more useful to think of them as parts within his concept of total war, a people’s war, or a super insurgency.56 The questions associated with the corollaries and implications of each of the above levels of analysis, thus, imply no easy set of tasks. However, if the United States and the other countries of the Americas ignore what is happening in the region, that <strong>inaction could destroy the democracy, free market economies, and prosperity</strong> that has been achieved, <strong>and place the posterity of the hemisphere at serious risk</strong>. SOME FINAL THOUGHTS ON CHÁVEZ’S ASYMMETRICAL CONFLICT AS A CHALLENGE TO HEMISPHERIC SECURITY Chávez may be a military caudillo, but he is no “nut case.” He is, in fact, what Ralph Peters calls a “wise competitor.”57 He will not even attempt to defeat his enemies on their terms. Rather, he will seek to shift the playing field away from conventional military confrontations and turn to nontraditional forms of assault on a nation’s stability and integrity. Thus, it appears that this astute warrior is prepared to destabilize, to facilitate the processes of state failure, and thus to “destroy in order to rebuild” in true revolutionary fashion.58 As a consequence, it is important to understand that Chávez considers three issues to be key to success (or failure) in contemporary asymmetric conflict. They are closely related to his security scheme, social programs, and communications efforts. First, he understands the sophistication and complexity of war as a whole. He also understands the value of facilitating the processes of state failure to achieve the objectives of bolivarianismo. Finally, Chávez understands the centrality of relative moral legitimacy in conflict— and the critical importance of creating popular perceptions that his cause is morally correct, and will lead to a better life. These are the bases of power—all else, to him, is illusion. The Sophistication and Complexity of War as a Whole. Chávez understands that contemporary nontraditional war is not a kind of appendage (a lesser or limited thing) to the more comfortable conventional military attrition and maneuver warfare paradigms. It is a great deal more. Again, it may be military or nonmilitary, lethal or nonlethal, or a mix of everything within a state’s or a coalition of states’ array of instruments of power. As such, it may be a zero- sum game in which only one winner emerges or, in a worst-case scenario, no winner. It is, thus, total. That is to say, the “battlefield” is extended to everyone, everything, and everywhere.59 To give the mind as much room as possible to contemplate the sophistication and complexity—and the totality—of contemporary conflict, two Chinese colonels, Liang and Xiangsui, have provided a scenario that is instructive and sobering: If the attacking side secretly musters large amounts of capital without the enemy nation being aware of this, and launches a sneak attack against its financial markets, then after causing a financial crisis, buries a computer virus and hacker detachment in the opponent’s computer system in advance, while at the same time carrying out a network attack against the enemy so that the civilian electricity network, traffic dispatching network, financial transaction network, telephone communications network, and mass media network are completely paralyzed, this will cause the enemy nation to fall into social panic, street riots, and a political crisis. There is finally the forceful bearing down by the army, and military means are utilized in gradual stages until the enemy is forced to sign a dishonorable peace treaty.60 Chávez understands all this. He understands that war is no longer limited to using military violence to bring about desired political change. Rather, all means that can be brought to bear on a given situation must be used to compel a targeted government to do one’s will. This caudillo will tailor his campaign to his adversaries’ political and economic vulnerabilities, and to their psychological precepts. And this is the basis of Chávez’s instruction to the Venezuelan armed forces (at the “1st Military Forum on Fourth Generation War and Asymmetric War” in 2004) to develop a doctrinal paradigm change from conventional to people’s war.61 </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The Issue of State Failure. - President Chávez also understands that the process leading to</span> <u><strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">state failure is the most dangerous </span>long-term <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">security challenge</span> facing the global community today</strong></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.

<em>As a global power, the US has several national interests beyond the Caribbean in which it is engaged. Global counter-terrorism, especially in the Afghanistan and Iraq theatres, concerns the US greatly. Improving relations with Europe, engagement in Israel and Palestine post-Arafat, containing Iran and North Korea, and focusing on Mexico, the Andean and the Southern Cone countries are also highly important national interests. However, <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">national interest</span></u> also <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">dictates that the Caribbean not be forgotten</span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">.</span> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Global engagement must actively consider this region</span></u>. Four <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">fulcrums of national interest</span></u>, or “value arenas,” <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">make the Caribbean a zone of strategic importance</span></u>. These are democracy, geopolitics, geo-economics, and geo-narcotics. Democracy is a core US political value and national interest. Unfortunately the pursuit of this goal often conflicts with other interests, creating a mixed record. For instance, the US has both worked against unacceptable democratic expressions within some countries, and has also supported weak democracies in other countries. Parts of the Caribbean are bastions of electoral democracy. Despite strong procedural democracy, a number of dangers must be resolved. Low and declining voter turn-out, electoral fraud, and drug money in campaign financing endanger the credibility of the democratic process in some places in the region. Moreover, <u>several factors undermine confidence in democracy</u>. <u>These include poverty, corruption</u>, and dysfunctional judicial systems. Involvement mitigates the risks these problems pose to US core national interests. The second fulcrum is geopolitics. <u>Location and <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">proximity make a difference</span>, especially if they coexist with a strategic resource that is important commercially and militarily.</u> <u>Six <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Caribbean</span> Basin <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">countries</span></u>, including Venezuela, <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">produce oil.</span></u> Chavez and his policies are significant in how the US does business. But the importance of hydrocarbons goes beyond production to refinement. Six other countries refine oil, and provide a significant quantity to service the US market. <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Bauxite is another strategic resource</span></u>, and a significant proportion of Unites States imports of this commodity comes from the Caribbean Basin. <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Used in circuitry</span>,</u> airplane components, and aluminum products, <u>the proximity of the source as well as cheap import costs place access to this resource from the Caribbean an element of US national interest.</u> As another aspect of geopolitics, <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">the Caribbean is vital in US worldwide engagement as a part of the security network</span></u>. <u>This is the “southern flank”</u> or “strategic rear” or “third border.” Military Assistance Advisory groups and Military Liaison Offices coordinate force presence. Beyond this, <u>there are <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Forward Operating Locations in the Caribbean</span> that <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">are vital to the prosecution of missions</span></u> against drug production and trafficking, and terrorism. From the Caribbean vantage point, the military bases are an important part of their economy. While the rents may not represent much money for the US, they can do a lot for the countries concerned. Hence, strategically, <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">the US and Caribbean</span> countries <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">rely on each other</span></u>.</em><br />

For instance, the United States is the dominant naval power everywhere, such that other nations cannot compete with it even in their home waters. They either happily or grudgingly allow the United States Navy to be the guarantor of international waterways and trade routes, of international access to markets and raw materials such as oil. Even when the United States engages in a war, it is able to play its role as guardian of the waterways. In a more genuinely multipolar world, however, it would not. Nations would compete for naval dominance at least in their own regions and possibly beyond. </span><u>Conflict between nations would involve struggles on the oceans as well as on land. Armed embargos, of the kind used in World War I and other major conflicts, would disrupt trade flows in a way that is now impossible</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. Such order as exists in the world rests not merely on the goodwill of peoples but on a foundation provided by American power. Even the European Union, that great geopolitical miracle, owes its founding to American power, for without it the European nations after World War ii would never have felt secure enough to reintegrate Germany.

They believe the order the world enjoys today exists independently of American power. They imagine that in a world where American power was diminished, the aspects of international order that they like would remain in place. But that 's not the way it works. International order does not rest on ideas and institutions. It is shaped by configurations of power. The international order we know today reflects the distribution of power in the world since World War ii, and especially since the end of the Cold War. A different configuration of power, a multipolar world in which the poles were Russia, China, the United States, India, and Europe, would produce its own kind of order, with different rules and norms reflecting the interests of the powerful states that would have a hand in shaping it. Would that international order be an improvement? Perhaps for Beijing and Moscow it would. But it is doubtful that it would suit the tastes of enlightenment liberals in the United States and Europe. The current order, of course, is not only far from perfect but also offers no guarantee against major conflict among the world's great powers. Even under the umbrella of unipolarity, regional conflicts involving the large powers may erupt.</span> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">War could erupt between China</span> and <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Taiwan</span></u> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">and draw in both the United States and Japan.

<br />
<em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The tension between U.S. policy and </span><u>the desperation to leave is spawning a debate in Washington over whether the government should let more Haitians in</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Immigration advocates</span> and</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">several members of</span> <strong><u>Congress have begun <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">pressing</span></u></strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;"> the D</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">epartment of </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">H</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">omeland </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">S</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">ecurity </span><u>and the State Department</u> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">to ease the rules</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. So far, the focus is on two groups: Haitians with relatives legally in the United States and a few hundred injured children who, in the judgment of doctors doing relief work in Haiti, could die without sophisticated medical care. In the first days after the Jan. 12 quake, Napolitano announced that the government would admit Haitian children already on the cusp of adoption and that it would allow Haitians who were in the United States illegally to stay for 18 months. The administration has not eased restrictions for children newly orphaned or injured by the disaster, Haitians who had already been seeking U.S. visas, or any other earthquake victims who want to come. Late last week, Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) said Homeland Security officials had told him the agency would grant &quot;humanitarian parole&quot; to about 200 severely injured Haitian children. Even after that, Nelson said, he got a late-night e-mail, with the subject line &quot;HELP,&quot; from a Miami neurosurgeon doing relief work, saying the U.S. Embassy in Haiti would not allow three critically burned children to be flown to a Miami burn unit. Nelson also said the State Department had issued a memo saying that a 17-year-old named Samantha, with a broken back and a father in Michigan, &quot;would be ineligible to board an aircraft to the United States.&quot; &quot;Typical bureaucratic crap that needs to be cut through,&quot; Nelson said in an interview. While Nelson wants to admit only critically injured children for treatment, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">a <strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">groundswell is building</span></strong> in favor of letting</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">certain </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Haitians emigrate</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Advocates' immediate focus is Haitians who, before the disaster, had applied -- and in some cases been approved -- for a kind of visa available to foreign relatives of U.S. citizens or permanent legal residents. About 19,000 Haitians have pending applications for such visas, according to DHS. Nearly 55,000 Haitians have been approved for family visas but are on waiting lists to enter because Congress has set limits on how many may come each year, the State Department says. Given the quotas, &quot;it can take years and years for families to be reunited,&quot; said Cheryl Little, executive director of the Florida Immigrant Advocacy Center. A spokesman for </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Homeland Security's</span> C</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">itizenship and </span><u>I</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">mmigration </span><u>S</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">ervices </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">said the agency would &quot;<strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">put at the head of the line&quot;</span></strong></span> applicants for</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">relative</span> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">visas from Haiti</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. But he and a State Department spokeswoman acknowledged that quicker visa approvals would not mean those Haitians could enter the United States more quickly unless Congress alters the quotas -- something lawmakers are not discussing. Lavinia Limon, president of the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, said that letting Haitians join U.S. relatives would relieve at least some of the humanitarian burden in Port-au-Prince. The United States, she said, has airlifted foreigners out of other emergencies, such as Albanians from Kosovo and refugees from the Vietnam War. Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that favors tighter controls on immigration, countered that &quot;poverty and underdevelopment can't be criteria we use to pick immigrants. There are too many of them.&quot; And he said that Haitian earthquake victims could consume U.S. social services and displace American workers -- without generating enough income to send back to Haiti &quot;to make a difference&quot; there. Still, Elliott Abrams, </span><u>a deputy national security adviser under President</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> George W. </span><u>Bush</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">who is now at the Council on Foreign Relations, </span><u>said that if the U</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">nited </span><u>S</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">tates </span><u>doubled for the next five years the 25,000 Haitians who have been coming to the United States annually, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">it would substantially increase the remittances sent back, providing critical help as the nation</span> tries to rebuild. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Such help streaming home to families is more reliable and more likely to be spent efficiently than</span> the ebb and flow of <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">foreign aid</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, he said. Abrams suggested that to satisfy critics of increased immigration, the United States could offset the influx of Haitians by temporarily slowing immigration from elsewhere. </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">Among Haitians and their</span><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;"> U.S. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">relatives</span></span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, Limon predicted, </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">pressure on U.S. immigration policy will escalate</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in the coming weeks and months. &quot;You need a boat, a captain, money. Nobody has that,&quot; she said. &quot;But in two weeks, four weeks, six weeks, they will.&quot; </span></em><br />

The Department of Labor must first demonstrate there is no US worker available for the job (labor certification). Then, USCIS determines that the foreign national applicant qualifies for admission, via adjudication of a petition referred to as an I-140. With that approval, the applicant can apply for adjustment of status (I485 application) if already in the United States or a visa if abroad. As DOL and USCIS reduce the backlog of cases in administrative limbo, more cases are subject to the statutory ceilings discussed above and waiting times have accordingly lengthened.

<em><u>The question of migration is</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> also, I think, </span><u>very important</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. It ties into this question of who gets to say what. </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">Haiti has a</span><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;"> long</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, in many ways </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">wonderful, relationship with its diaspora</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> but, in many ways, quite complicated. For some people the word &quot;diaspora&quot; is not such a nice thing to say. MABRY: Haitians themselves view the diaspora negatively. WUCKER: Exactly. And a lot Haitian Americans I know who've gone down to Haiti say, oh, there they call me a &quot;blond,&quot; which can mean a white person, but it can also mean a foreigner. And they say, I'm treated as a foreigner in my own country. </span><strong><u>Lots and <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">lots of Haitian American</span></u></strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">s have</span> just really poured out enthusiasm, help, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">raised money</span>. A lot of <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">people have</span> the kind <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">the skills that</span> I think <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Haiti could really use</span> right now.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">But I think that there are some things that Haiti has to resolve within itself to be able to employ some of these skills. I </span><u>think absolutely <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">allowing</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> more </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">people to emigrate</span> to the U</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">nited </span><u>S</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">tates </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">is important</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. But the flip side of that is a long-going debate over brain drain versus brain circulation. I was talking to someone the other day, thinking oh, Canada has taken all of Haiti's best and brightest, so they're not left in the country. I think that </span><u>the idea of best-and-brightest should be defined pretty broadly</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Some of those </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">cab drivers or small-business owners</span></u></strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;"> are</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">actually also, frankly, </span><u>part of</u> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Haiti's best </span>and brightest.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">And I </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">think a lot</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">of them do </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">want to contribute their skills</span></u></strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-size: 8pt;">.</span> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">What they've learned helps to train other Haitians</span> to help, to be involved in engineering projects and education projects. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Haitian</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">physician</span><u>s</u> <u>abroad <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">have been</span> incredibly generous -- a sort of a long-running relationship, <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">going back and trying to help</span></strong></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">with hospitals there. So </span><u>but at the same time <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">there are</span> -- a lot of <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">these best-and-brightest</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, until recently, were </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">not allowed access to legal status</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. And I think </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">that</span> very much <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">limited their ability to go back and forth, to be able to earn enough money to</span> really <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">contribute</span> what they could back home. Instead, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">they were</span> very much <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">in limbo</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. So I think </span><u>we</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">do </span><u>need to look at more flexible arrangements for Haitians aboard</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. And that's going to involve some changes in attitudes in Haiti, some changes in attitudes here, and also a lot of attention to how do you also make sure that we're building skills in Haiti to stay in Haiti, not just to go abroad.</span></em><br />

It would create a limited number of guest-worker visas for a transitional period of three years, during which a new “Commission on Immigration and Labor Markets” would come up with a more permanent solution.

<em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">But is it? </span><u>A new report by the</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Institute for Public Policy Research (</span><u>IPPR</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">) </span><u>shows that <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">migration may be a far better way of helping the world’s poor</span> than aid</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>The report, based on 10,000 household surveys in seven countries, suggests that <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">migrants</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> working overseas </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">deliver tangible benefits in ways that aid</span> and foreign investment just <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">can’t</span>.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Globally, migrants sent home about £220 billion to developing countries last year; four times the total volume of aid. </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Without</span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-size: 8pt;"> these “</span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">remittances</span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-size: 8pt;">”</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span><u>some</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Third World </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">countries would struggle to survive</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In Tajikistan, remittances account for more than two-fifths of the total economy; in Senegal, remittances are 12 times foreign investment inflows. The African continent receives $36 per capita in aid but $44 in remittances. Moreover, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">remittances have emerged as</span> one of the most <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">resilient sources of income for poorer countries</span> during the downturn</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">This money</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> — which usually goes straight to families with no strings attached — </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">can be critical in boosting the quality of life of poorer households</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> worldwide. For example, in Georgia and Jamaica a household with a member abroad is one-third less likely to experience unemployment. In Ghana, households with absent migrants spend $107 more per year on education than those without; in Jamaica, each returned migrant in a household increases healthcare spending by more than 50%. </span><strong><u><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">When <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">migrants</span> return — and significant proportions do, even to the poorest countries — they usually <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">bring</span> with them <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">new resources, skills and networks</span></span></u></strong><u>. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">This can be critical in promoting entrepreneurship and trade</span> in local economies</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>The migration experience can</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> also</span> <u>change attitudes for the better</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. For example, </span><u>more than 70% of returned migrants say that because of their experiences abroad they are now more committed to equality</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> between men and women. Men are prepared to do some childcare, for instance. So it is possible that </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">migration contributes to long-term social and cultural changes, as well as</span> to <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">economic development</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Of course, migration can mean “brain drain”: countries such as Fiji and Jamaica are estimated to have lost about three-quarters of their highly skilled professionals. But the picture’s not all bad: the money, skills and ideas that migrants send home, or bring back with them, often outweigh the negative impacts. And the knowledge that a good education and skills can open up the chance to migrate provides a powerful incentive to young people to work hard at school and university. Some, but not all, will end up leaving, so the pool of skilled people in a country may grow. These findings have important implications for the new government’s strategy on international development. </span><u>Migration should become an integral part of the development agenda because <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">migration can do things that aid cannot</span>. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Aid</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> has some well known weaknesses — it </span><u>can <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">get tied up in bureaucracies and its effectiveness can be blunted by corruption</span>. In contrast<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">, remittances go directly to households and are spent by families</span>, not officials</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Both migration and aid have a place in development strategies, but a change in approach — </span><u>more support for migration</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and less focus on aid — </span><u>is overdue</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span></em><br />

<em><u>We must</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> also </span><u>encourage the participation of the</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> prosperous, educated </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Haitian</span>-<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">diaspora</span> in the US</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">and Canadian </span><u>because they <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">have the potential to be <strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">major assets</span></strong> in the reconstruction of the country</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>As Haiti is only 600 miles from the U.S. mainland, such individuals would be able to come and go with relative ease</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Such efforts should be accompanied by a program that enables Haitians to come to the US to attain education. The most successful institution-building program used by USAID historically was its scholarship programs which brought 18,000 students a year to US colleges and universities to get their graduate degrees. The USAID scholarship programs have been phased out over time because Washington regulators demanded immediate and visible results which scholarships could not produce. But </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">they can produce transformational long term change</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">because graduates usually return </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">to their home countries</span> from their US experience <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">as <strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">reformers</span></strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.

But without buy-in from elites, the vested interests in Haitian society will undermine any reform efforts. Even </span><u>though</u> <u>major natural disasters are</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">sometimes </span><u>a catalyst to reform movements, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">no outside aid agency</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, whether it be the UN, World Bank, the NGOs, or USAID, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">can substitute for Haitian leadership</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Without such competent and honest Haitian leadership, any institution building exercise will fail. Lasting change will be achieved when Haitian political leaders show the political will to enact and implement major political and economic reforms. </span><u>Haitian President Prevel has shown some technical skill in undertaking improved governance over the past two years</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, but he remained virtually invisible in the humanitarian aid effort which damaged him politically. </span><u>He will need help, and <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">one of the best ways of generating</span> that <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">help in a country which has </span>had <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">a chronic leadership deficit, is to bring back Haitians from the diaspora to help</span> him <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">build new Haitian institutions.</span></u></em><br />

As men and women appropriate the various forms of expression, they are empowered to uncover new dimensions of existence that were previously hidden&quot; (1993, p. 96). </span><span class="Style4Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-size: 9pt;">This</span></span> <span style="font-size: 9pt;">process </span><span class="Style4Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-size: 9pt;">is particularly crucial in the public argument context, since a </span></span></strong>key guarantor <strong>of inequality and exploitation<span style="font-size: 9pt;"> in contemporary </span><span class="Style4Char"><span style="font-size: 9pt;">society <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">is the</span></span></span> <span style="font-size: 9pt;">widespread and uncritical </span><span class="Style4Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-size: 9pt;">acceptance by citizens of politically inert self-identities. </span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">The problems of political alienation, apathy and withdrawal have received lavish treatment</span></span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> as perennial topics of scholarly analysis (see e.g. Fishkin 1997; Grossberg 1992; Hart 1998; Loeb 1994). </span><span class="Style4Char"><span style="font-size: 9pt;">Unfortunately</span></span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">, comparatively </span><span class="Style4Char"><span style="font-size: 9pt;">less energy has been devoted to</span></span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> the development of pedagogical strategies for </span><span class="Style4Char"><span style="font-size: 9pt;">countering this</span></span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> alarming political </span><span class="Style4Char"><span style="font-size: 9pt;">trend</span></span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">. However, some scholars have taken up the task of theorizing emancipatory and critical pedagogies, and argumentation scholars interested in expanding the learning potential of debate would do well to note their work (see e.g. Apple 1995, 1988, 1979; Britzman 1991; Giroux 1997, 1988, 1987; Greene 1978; McLaren 1993, 1989; Simon 1992; Weis and Fine 1993). In this area of educational scholarship, the curriculum theory of currere, a method of teaching pioneered by Pinar and Grumet (1976), speaks directly to many of the issues already discussed in this essay. As the Latin root of the word &quot;curriculum,&quot; currere translates roughly as the investigation of public life (see Kincheloe 1993, p. 146). According to Pinar, &quot;the method of currere is one way to work to liberate one from the web of political, cultural, and economic influences that are perhaps buried from conscious view but nonetheless comprise the living web that is a person's biographic situation&quot; (Pinar 1994, p. 108). The objectives of role-play pedagogy resonate with the currere method. </span><span class="Style4Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-size: 9pt;">By opening discursive spaces for students to explore their identities as public actors, simulated</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> public <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">arguments provide occasions for students</span></span></span> <span style="font-size: 9pt;">to survey and </span><span class="Style4Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-size: 9pt;">appraise submerged aspects of their </span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">political <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">identities</span></span></span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">. </span><span class="Style4Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-size: 9pt;">Since many aspects of</span></span> <span style="font-size: 9pt;">cultural and political </span><span class="Style4Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-size: 9pt;">life </span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">work</span></span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> currently </span><span class="Style4Char"><span style="font-size: 9pt;">to <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">reinforce</span></span></span> <span style="font-size: 9pt;">political <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">pas</span></u></span><span class="Style4Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-size: 9pt;">sivity, critical </span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">argumentation <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">pedagogies </span>that highlight</span></span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> this component of </span><span class="Style4Char"><span style="font-size: 9pt;">students' self-identities <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">carry </span></span></span></strong>significant emancipatory potential<strong><span style="font-size: 9pt;">.</span></strong></em><br />

<em><strong>Moreover, <u>keeping in mind the sobering lessons of the past century cannot but make us wary about humankind’s supposedly unlimited ability for</u> problemsolving or <u>discovering solutions in time to avert calamities. In fact, the historical track-record of last-minute,</u> technical ‘quick-fixes’ <u>is hardly reassuring. What’s more, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">most of the serious perils that we face today</span> (e.g., nuclear waste, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">climate change</span>, global <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">terrorism</span>, genocide and civil <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">war) demand complex, sustained, long-term strategies</span></u> of planning, coordination, and execution. On the other hand, an examination of fatalism makes it readily apparent that the idea that humankind is doomed from the outset puts off any attempt to minimize risks for our successors, essentially condemning them to face cataclysms unprepared. <u>An a priori pessimism is also unsustainable given the fact that <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">long-term preventive action has had</span></u> (and will continue to have) <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">appreciable beneficial effects; the examples of medical research</span>, the welfare state, international <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">humanitarian law</span>, as well as strict <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">environmental regulations</span></u> in some countries <u>stand out <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">among many others</span>.</u> The evaluative framework proposed above should not be restricted to the critique of misappropriations of farsightedness, since it can equally support public deliberation with a reconstructive intent, that is, democratic discussion and debate about a future that human beings would freely self-determine. Inverting Foucault’s Nietzschean metaphor, we can think of genealogies of the future that could perform a farsighted mapping out of the possible ways of organizing social life. They are, in other words, interventions into the present intended to facilitate global civil society’s participation in shaping the field of possibilities of what is to come. <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Once competing dystopian visions are filtered out on the basis of their analytical credibility</span>, ethical commitments, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">and</span> political underpinnings and <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">consequences</span>, groups and <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">individuals can assess</span> the remaining legitimate catastrophic <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">scenarios</span></u> through the lens of genealogical mappings of the future. Hence, our first duty consists in addressing the present-day causes of eventual perils, ensuring that the paths we decide upon do not contract the range of options available for our posterity.42 Just as importantly, the practice of genealogically inspired farsightedness nurtures the project of an autonomous future, one that is socially self-instituting. In so doing, we can acknowledge that the future is a human creation instead of the product of metaphysical and extra-social forces (god, nature, destiny, etc.), and begin to reflect upon and deliberate about the kind of legacy we want to leave for those who will follow us. <u>Participants in global civil society can then take – and in many instances have already taken – a further step by committing themselves to socio-political struggles forging a world order that, aside from not jeopardizing human and environmental survival, is designed to rectify the sources of transnational injustice that will continue to inflict needless suffering upon future generations</u> if left unchallenged.</strong></em><br />

<em><strong>The decline of the public sphere in late twentieth-century America poses a series of great dilemmas and challenges. <u>Many ideological currents scrutinized here – <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">localism, metaphysics</span></u>, spontaneism, <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">post-modernism</span></u>, Deep Ecology – intersect with and reinforce each other. While these currents have deep origins in popular movements of the 1960s and 1970s, they remain very much alive in the 1990s. Despite their different outlooks and trajectories, they <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">all share</span> one thing in common: a <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">depoliticized expression of struggles</span> to combat and overcome alienation.</u> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">The false sense of empowerment</span> that comes with such mesmerizing impulses <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">is accompanied by a loss of public engagement, a</span>n erosion of citizenship and a depleted capacity of individuals in large groups to work for social change. As this ideological quagmire worsens, urgent problems that are destroying the fabric of American society will go unsolved</u> – perhaps even unrecognized – <u>only to fester more ominously in the future. And such problems (<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">ecological crisis, poverty</span>, urban decay, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">spread of infectious diseases</span>,</u> technological displacement of workers) <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">cannot be understood</span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;"> <u>outside the</u></span> <u>larger social and <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">global context of internationalized markets</span></u>, finance, and communications. Paradoxically, <u>the widespread retreat from politics, often inspired by localist sentiment, comes at a time when agendas that ignore or sidestep these global realities will, more than ever, be reduced to impotence</u>. In his commentary on the state of citizenship today, Wolin refers to the increasing sublimation and dilution of politics, as larger numbers of people turn away from public concerns toward private ones. By diluting the life of common involvements, we negate the very idea of politics as a source of public ideals and visions. 74 In the meantime</strong><u>, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">the fate of the world hangs in the balance</span>.</u> <strong>The unyielding truth is that, <u>even as the ethos of anti-politics becomes more compelling and even fashionable in the U</u>nited <u>S</u>tates, <u>it is the vagaries of political power that will continue to decide the fate of human societies.</u> This last point demands further elaboration. <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">The shrinkage of politics </span></u></strong><u>hardly means that corporate colonization will be less of a reality, that social hierarchies will somehow disappear, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">or that gigantic state and military structures will lose their hold</span> over people’s lives. <strong>Far from it:</strong> <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">the space abdicated</span><strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;"> by a broad citizenry</span>, well-informed and ready to participate at many levels,</strong> <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">can in fact be filled by authoritarian and reactionary elites</span></u> <strong>– an already familiar dynamic in many lesser-developed countries<u>. The fragmentation and chaos of a Hobbesian world,</u> not very far removed from the rampant individualism, social Darwinism, and civic violence that have been so much a part of the American landscape, <u>could be the prelude to a powerful Leviathan designed to impose order in the face of disunity and atomized retrea</u>t<u>. In this way the eclipse of politics might set the stage for a reassertion of politics in more virulent guise</u> – <u>or it might help further rationalize the existing power structure.</u> In either case, the state would likely become what Hobbes anticipated: the embodiment of those universal, collective interests that had vanished from civil society. 75</strong></em><br />

<em><strong>Yet does the sort of symbolic exchange which <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Baudrillard</span></u> advocates really provide a solution to the question of death? Baudrillard’s notion of symbolic exchange between life and death and his ultimate embrace of nihilism (see 4.4) is probably his most un-Nietzschean moment, the instant in which his thought <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">radically devalues life</span></u> and focuses with a fascinated gaze on that which is most terrible — death. In a popular French reading of Nietzsche, his ‘transvaluation of values’ demanded negation of all repressive and life- negating values in favor of affirmation of life, joy and happiness. This ‘philosophy of value’ valorized life over death and derived its values from phenomena which enhanced, refined and nurtured human life. <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">In Baudrillard</span></u>, by contrast, <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">life does not exist as an autonomous source of value</span>, and the body exists only as ‘the caarnality of signs,’ as a mode of display of signification. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">His sign fetishism erases all materialjty from the body and social life, and makes possible a fascinated aestheticized fetishism</span> of signs as the primary ontological reality. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">This way of seeing erases suffering</span>, disease, pain <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">and the horror of death from the body and social life and replaces it with the play of signs</span> — Baudrillard’s alternative. Politics too is reduced to a play of signs, and the ways in which different politics alleviate or intensify human suffering disappears from the Baudrillardian universe.</u> Consequently <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Baudrillard’s theory spirals into a fascination with signs</span> which leads him to embrace certain privileged forms of sign culture and to reject others</u> (that is, the theoretical signs of modernity such as meaning, truth, the social, power and so on) <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">and to pay less and less attention to materiality</span></u> (that is, to needs, desire, suffering and so on) <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">a trajectory will ultimately lead him to embrace nihilism</span></u> (see 4.4).</strong></em><br />

<em><strong>Yet the opposite tendency may pose an even greater danger<u>. On the whole, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">security studies have profited from its connection to real-world issues</span>; the main advances of the past four decades have emerged from efforts to solve important practical questions. If security studies succumbs to the tendency for academic disciplines to pursue “the trivial, the formal, the methodological, the purely theoretical</u>, the remotely historical–<u>in short, the politically irrelevent”</u> (Morgenthau, 1966:73), <u>its theoretical progress and its practical value will inevitably decline.</u></strong></em><br />
<em><strong>In short, <u>security studies must steer between the Scylla of political opportunism and the Charybdis of academic irrelevance.</u> What does this mean in practice? Among other things, <u>it means that security studies should remain wary of the counterproductive tangents that have seduced other areas of international studies, most notably the “post-modern” approach to international affairs</u> (Ashley, 1984; Der Derian and Shapiro, 1989, Lapid, 1989). Contrary to their proponents’ claims, <u>post<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">-modern approaches have yet to demonstrate much value for comprehending world politics;</span> to date, these works are mostly criticism and not much theory</u>. As Robert Keohane has noted, until these writers “have delineated...a research programe and shown...that it can illuminate important issues in world politics, they will remain on the margins of the field” (Keohane, 1988:392). <u>In particular, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">issues of war and peace are too important</span> for the field <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">to be diverted into a</span> prolix and <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">self-indulgent discourse</span> that is divorced from the real world.</u> Because scientific disciplines advance through competition, <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">we should not try to impose a single methodological monolith upon the field. To insist that a single method constitutes the only proper approach is like saying that a hammer is the only proper tool for building a house</span>.</u> The above strictures are no more than a warning, therefore; <u>progress will be best served by increased dialogue between different methodological approaches</u> (Downs, 1989).</strong></em><br />

<em><strong>Commenting on the ‘philosophical turn’ in IR, Wæver remarks that <span class="CardText1Char">‘[a] frenzy for words like “epistemology” and “ontology”</span> often <span class="CardText1Char">signals this philosophical turn</span>’, although he goes on to comment that these terms are often used loosely.<span style="font-size: 5.5pt;">4 </span>However, loosely deployed or not, it is clear that debates concerning ontology and epistemology play a central role in the contemporary IR theory wars. In one respect, this is unsurprising since it is a characteristic feature of the social sciences that periods of disciplinary disorientation involve recourse to reflection on the philosophical commitments of different theoretical approaches, and there is no doubt that such reflection can play a valuable role in making explicit the commitments that characterise (and help individuate) diverse theoretical positions. Yet, <span class="CardText1Char">such a </span>philosophical<span class="CardText1Char"> turn is not without its dangers </span>and I will briefly mention three before turning to consider a confusion that has, I will suggest, helped to promote the IR theory wars by motivating this philosophical turn. The first danger with the philosophical turn is that <span class="CardText1Char">it has an inbuilt tendency to</span><span class="CardText2Char"> prioritise </span><span class="CardText1Char">issues of ontology and epistemology over explanatory and/or interpretive power as if the latter</span> two <span class="CardText1Char">were merely a </span><span class="CardText2Char">simple function</span><span class="CardText1Char"> of the former. </span>But while <span class="CardText1Char">the explanatory and</span>/or <span class="CardText1Char">interpretive power of a theoretical account is not </span>wholly independent of its ontological and/or epistemological commitments (otherwise criticism of these features would not be a criticism that had any value), it is by no means clear that it is, in contrast, <span class="CardText1Char">wholly dependent on these philosophical commitments.</span> Thus, for example, one need not be sympathetic to rational choice theory to recognise that it can provide powerful accounts of certain kinds of problems, such as the tragedy of the commons in which dilemmas of collective action are foregrounded.<span class="CardText1Char"> It may</span>, of course, <span class="CardText1Char">be the case that the advocates of rational choice theory cannot give a good account of why this type of theory is powerful </span>in accounting for this class of problems (i.e., how it is that the relevant actors come to exhibit features in these circumstances that approximate the assumptions of rational choice theory) and, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">i</span><span class="CardText1Char">f this is the case, it is a philosophical weakness—but this </span><span class="CardText2Char">does not undermine</span><span class="CardText1Char"> the point that, for a certain class of problems, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">rational choice</span> theory <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">may </span></span><span class="CardText2Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">provide the best account available to us.</span></span> In other words, <span class="CardText1Char">while the critical judgement of theoretical accounts in terms of their ontological and/or epistemological sophistication is one kind of critical judgement, it is not the only or even necessarily the </span><span class="CardText2Char">most important </span><span class="CardText1Char">kind</span>. The second danger run by the philosophical turn is that <span class="CardText1Char">because <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">prioritisation of ontology and epistemology promotes theory-construction</span></span> from philosophical first principles<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">,</span><span class="CardText2Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;"> it cultivates a theory-driven rather than problem-driven approach to IR</span>.</span> Paraphrasing Ian Shapiro, the point can be put like this:<span class="CardText1Char"> since</span> it is the case that <span class="CardText1Char">there is always a plurality of possible true descriptions </span>of a given action, event or phenomenon,<span class="CardText1Char"> <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">the challenge is to decide which is</span> the <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">most apt</span> </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-size: 11pt;">i</span></u><span class="CardText1Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">n</span> terms of <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">getting a</span> perspicuous </span><span class="CardText2Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">grip on</span></span> the <span class="CardText2Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">action</span>,</span> event or phenomenon in question given the purposes of the inquiry; yet, from this standpoint, <u>‘</u><span class="CardText1Char">t<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">heory-driven work is part of a </span></span><span class="CardText2Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">reductionist program</span>’</span><span class="CardText1Char"> in that it ‘dictates always <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">opting for</span> the description that calls for the <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">explanation that flows from the </span></span><span class="CardText2Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">preferred model</span> </span><span class="CardText1Char">or theory’.5 The justification</span> offered for this strategy <span class="CardText1Char">rests on the mistaken belief that it is necessary for social science because general explanations are required to characterise the classes of phenomena studied in similar terms. </span>However, as Shapiro points out,<span class="CardText2Char"> this is to misunderstand the enterprise of science</span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> since</span></u> <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">‘</span><span class="CardText1Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">whether there are general explanations for classes of phenomena is a question for social-scientific inquiry, </span></span><span class="CardText2Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">not to be prejudged </span></span><span class="CardText1Char">before conducting that inquiry’</span>.<span style="font-size: 5.5pt;">6 </span>Moreover, <span class="CardText1Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">this strategy easily slips into </span>the promotion of the pursuit of </span><span class="CardText2Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">generality over</span></span><span class="CardText1Char"> that of </span><span class="CardText2Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">empirical validity</span>.</span> The third danger is that <span class="CardText1Char">the preceding</span> two <span class="CardText1Char">combine to encourage the formation of a</span> particular image of disciplinary debate in IR—what might be called (only slightly tongue in cheek) ‘the <span class="CardText1Char">Highlander view’</span>—namely, <span class="CardText1Char">an image of warring theoretical approaches</span> with each, despite occasional temporary tactical alliances, dedicated to the strategic achievement of sovereignty over the disciplinary field. It encourages this view because <span class="CardText1Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">the</span></span> turn to, and <span class="CardText2Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">prioritisation of, ontology and epistemology stimulates the idea that there can only be one theoretical approach which gets things right</span></span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">,</span> namely, the theoretical approach that gets its ontology and epistemology right. <span class="CardText1Char">This image feeds back into IR exacerbating the first and second dangers, and so a potentially </span><span class="CardText2Char">vicious circle arises.</span></strong></em><br />

<br />
<em><strong><u>While theoretical debates at academic conferences are important to academics, the discourse and concerns of foreign-policy decision- makers are quite different, so different that they constitute a distinctive</u> problem- solving, theory-averse, <u>policy-making subculture. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">There is a danger that academics assume that the discourses they engage are more significant in the practice of foreign policy and the exercise of power than they really are</span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">.</span> This is not, however, to minimize the obvious importance of academia as a general institutional structure among many that sustain certain epistemic communities in particular states. In general, I do not disagree with <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Dalby’s</span></u> fourth point about politics and discourse except to note that his <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">statement-</span>‘Precisely because <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">reality could be represented in particular ways</span></u> political decisions could be taken, troops and material moved and war fought’-<u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">evades the important question of agency</span></u> that I noted in my review essay. <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">The assumption that it is representations that make action possible is inadequate by itself. Political, military and economic structures, institutions, discursive networks and leadership are all crucial in explaining social action and should be theorized together with representational practices</span></u>. Both here and earlier, Dalby’s reasoning inclines towards a form of idealism. In response to Dalby’s fifth point (with its three subpoints), it is worth noting, first, that his book is about the CPD, not the Reagan administration. He analyzes certain CPD discourses, root the geographical reasoning practices of the Reagan administration nor its public-policy reasoning on national security. Dalby’s book is narrowly teExt.ual; the general conteExt.uality of the Reagan administration is not dealt with. Second, let me simply note that I find that the distinction between critical theorists and post- structuralists is a little too rigidly and heroically drawn by Dalby and others. Third, Dalby’s interpretation of the reconceptualization of national security in Moscow as heavily influenced by dissident peace researchers in Europe is highly idealist, an interpretation that ignores the structural and ideological crises facing the Soviet elite at that time. Gorbachev’s reforms and his new security discourse were also strongly self- interested, an ultimately futile attempt to save the Communist Party and a discredited regime of power from disintegration. The issues raised by Simon Dalby in his comment are important ones for all those interested in the practice of critical geopolitics. While I agree with Dalby that questions of discourse are eExt.remely important ones for political geographers to engage, <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">there is a danger of fetishizing this concern with discourse so that we neglect the institutional and the sociological, the materialist and the cultural, the political and the geographical conteExt.s within which particular discursive strategies become significant</span>.</u> Critical geopolitics, in other words, should not be a prisoner of the sweeping ahistorical cant that sometimes accompanies ‘poststructuralism nor convenient reading strategies like the identity politics narrative; it needs to always be open to the patterned mess that is human history.</strong></em><br />

<em><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">There is a basic value inherent in organic being, a basic affirmation,</span> &quot;The <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Yes' of Life</span></u><strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">&quot; (IR 81). 15 &quot;</span></strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">The self-affirmation of being becomes emphatic in the opposition of life to death. Life is the explicit confrontation of being with not-being</span></u><strong><u>. . . . The 'yes' of all striving is here sharpened by the active `no' to not-being</u>&quot; <span style="font-size: 6pt;">(IR 81-2). Furthermore — and this is the crucial point for Jonas —</span></strong> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">this affirmation of life that is in all organic being has a binding obligatory force upon human beings</span></u><strong><u>. This blindly self-enacting &quot;yes&quot; gains obligating force in the seeing freedom of man,</u> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">who as the supreme outcome of nature's purposive labor is no longer its automatic executor but, with the power obtained from knowledge, can become its destroyer as well.</span> <u>He must adopt the &quot;yes&quot; into his will and impose the &quot;no&quot; to not-being on his power</u>. <span style="font-size: 6pt;">But precisely this transition from willing to obligation is the critical point of moral theory at which attempts at laying a foundation for it come so easily to grief. Why does now, in man, that become a duty which hitherto &quot;being&quot; itself took care of through all individual willings? (IR 82). We discover here the transition from is to &quot;ought&quot; — from the self-affirmation of life to the binding obligation of human beings to preserve life not only for the present but also for the future. But why do we need a new ethics? The subtitle of The Imperative of Responsibility — In Search of an Ethics for the Technological Age — indicates why we need a new ethics</span>. <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Modern technology has transformed the</span> nature and <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">consequences of human ac-tion so</span> radically that the underlying premises of <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">traditional ethics are no longer valid</span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">.</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> For the first time in history human beings possess the knowledge and the power to destroy life on this planet, including human life.</span> <u>Not only is there the new possibility of total nuclear disaster; there are the</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> even more invidious and threatening possibilities that result from the unconstrained </span><u>use of technologies that can destroy the environment required for</u> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">life. The major transformation brought about by modern technology is that the consequences of our actions frequently exceed by far anything we can envision. Jonas was one of the first philosophers to warn us about the unprecedented ethical and political problems that arise with the rapid development of biotechnology. He claimed that this was happening at a time when there was an &quot;ethical vacuum,&quot; when there did not seem to be any effective ethical principles to limit ot guide our ethical decisions. In the name of scientific and technological &quot;progress,&quot; there is a relentless pressure to adopt a stance where virtually anything is permissible, includ-ing transforming the genetic structure of human beings, as long as it is &quot;freely chosen.&quot; </span><u>We need</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, Jonas argued</span>, <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">a new categorical imperativ</span>e that <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">might be</span> formulated as follows: &quot;Act so that the effects of your action are compatible with the permanence of genuine human life&quot;;</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> or expressed negatively: &quot;</span><u>Act so that the effects of your action are not destructive of the future possibility of such a life&quot;</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">; or simply: &quot;</span></strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Do not compromise the conditions for an indefinite continuation of humanity on earth</span></u><strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">&quot;; or again turned positive: &quot;In your present choices, include the future wholeness of Man among the objects of your will.&quot; (IR 11)</span></strong></em><br />

<em><strong>But to return to our subject: <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Modern megatechnology contains</span></u> both of the <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">threats</span></u> we have named—that <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">of physical annihilation</span></u> and that of existential impoverishment: the former by means of its unquestionably negative potential for catastrophe (<u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">such as atomic war</span></u>), the latter by means of its positive potential for manipulation. Examples of this manipulation, which can lead to our ethical powerlessness, are the automation of all work, psychological and biological behavior control, various forms of totalitarianism, and—probably most dangerous of all—the genetic reshaping of our nature. Finally, as far <u>as environmental destruction is concerned</u>—i.e., not a sudden nuclear apocalypse but a gradual one by means of a completely peaceful technology in the service of humanity— <u>the physical threat itself becomes an existential one</u> if the end result is global misery that allows only for an imperative of naked survival devoid of all feeling of ethical responsibility. <u>With this, we return to the</u> other <u>desideratum for <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">the grounding of</span></u> an <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">ethics</span></u> for the future in a technological age: <u>the factual knowledge afforded by &quot;futurology.&quot;</u> We said earlier that this <u>knowledge <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">must</span> awaken the right feelings</u> in us in order <u>to <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">motivate us to act</span> with responsibility.</u> A few words are appropriate here about this emotional side of a vision of the future called for by ethics. If we first think, as we cannot help but do, of the fate man has imposed on the planet, a fate staring at us out of the future, then we are right to feel a miExt.ure of fear and guilt: fear because what we see ahead is something terrible; guilt because we are conscious of our own causal role in bringing it about. But <u>can something frightful</u>, <u>which will</u> <u>not affect us but</u> <u>those</u> who come much <u>later, frighten us</u>? Even watching a tragedy on the stage can do this, as we know. This analogy adds to our &quot;fear&quot; and anticipatory &quot;pity&quot; for later generations damned in advance, yet <u>we do not have the consolation</u> afforded by a stage drama that this is mere fiction; <u>the reality of <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">futurology's</span> warning denies us that</u>. Above all, however<u>, its <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">accusation that future generations</span> are our victims <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">makes the</span> selfish <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">distancing of our feelings</span></u>, which something remote otherwise permits, <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">morally impossible</span></u> for us.</strong> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Our horror at what the future holds cries out to us:</span> &quot;That must not be! <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">We must not permit that</span>!</u> <strong>We must not bring that about!&quot; <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">An unselfish fear</span></u> of what will eventuate long after us, anticipatory remorse on its account, <u>and sha</u>me on our own account <u>overcome us as sheer reflexes <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">triggered by</span></u> decency and by <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">solidarity with our species</span></u>.

In the end, then, it is the &quot;ontological imperative,&quot; discussed earlier, of man's &quot;ought-to-be,&quot; whether clearly recognized or dimly perceived, which absolutely forbids us to have the contemptible attitude of &quot;after us the deluge.&quot; Given the validity of this imperative (which many surely can agree upon without any philosophical substantiation), the responsibility we bear because of our power becomes a compelling law. <u>The role of power</u> in this entire context <u>is complicated</u> and in part paradoxical. <u>On the one hand,</u> <u>it is <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">the cause of the catastrophe we fear;</span> on the other, the sole means of its possible prevention</u>.</strong> <u>This prophylaxis <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">demands massive application of the same knowledge which is the source of our fateful power</span></u><strong>. <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">By struggling against</span> the effects of this <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">power, we are strengthening its roots</span></u>. Fear of our power has taken the place of the natural euphoria that once accompanied its possession, its enjoyment, and above all its self-engendered growth. It is no longer nature, as formerly, but our power over it which now fills us with fear— for the sake of nature and for our own sakes. Our power has become our master instead of our servant. <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">We must now gain control over</span></u> it. We have not yet done so, even though our power is entirely the result of our knowledge and our will. <u>Knowledge, will, and power are collective</u>, and therefore <u>control of them</u> <u>must</u> also <u>be collective</u>: it can come only from forces within the public sector.</strong> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">In other words, it must be political</span></u><strong>, and that requires in the long run a broad, grass-roots consensus.</strong></em><br />

<em><strong>Daryl Glaser. a scholar from South Africa, and therefore somebody directly familiar with life in a state that was once committed to institutionalised racism, has offered an important counter to the Bauman thesis and the simplistic interhnkinil by postmodern writers of the Holocaust and modernimJ°&quot; In a book written a decade after Mandela's release, Glaser argued that <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">it was not the surveillance</span></u><u>, statistics, and regulation <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">that were the aspects of Nazi behaviour demanding attention</span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">.</span> <u>Nor was it the 'lawfulness, planning, bureaucratic regulation or the professionalisation of knowledge' that fed into Nazi racial policies</u>. That is, Glaser claimed that the features of modernity showcased by the Bauman thesis were not what demanded attention; <u>rather<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">, it was the 'institutionalisation of a racial hierarchy</span> of wealth, status and power</u>, enforced by repressive, often arbitrary <u>state authority</u>, assisted by bad laws'. <u>What was wrong in Nazi Germany</u> (and in apartheid South Africa) <u>was not 'modernity'</u>, but <u>laws and politics that served ideas of racial superiority - a prejudice that was directly contrary to 'modern ideals like social justic</u>e'. <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Modernity</span></u> for Glaser <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">delivered ideas of social justice to South Africa</span></u>, while <u>its modalities in the form of statistics and regulation</u>, and so on <u>constituted the</u> very <u>means <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">by which illiteracy could be overcome, and</span> the <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">health</span> of the disadvantaged <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">improved</span>.</u> Rejecting the logic and political implications of the Bauman thesis, Glaser advocated <u>'more and better law, effectively enforced, and more &quot;scientific&quot; information about the condition of the people</u>, not less of these &quot;modern&quot; goods'. His view was that the people(s) of postapartheid South Africa were in a better position than in the recent past albeit still a perilous one, because the oppressed had identified with modernity's ideas of tolerance and equality, and had found solidarity in the global human rights supporters. <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Social development</span></u> (improved literacy and better health), he stressed, <u>requires planning, professionalised knowledge, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">and other modalities of modernity - not their rejection</span>.</u> What Glaser called the 'organisational machinery of &quot;modernity&quot; to give effect to &quot;modern&quot; ideas like social justice' 107 does not guarantee the security and hence prospects for emancipation for South Africa's peoples, but it does give them hope.105 The idea of progress is not what it was, but is more useful as a result. It should never be considered as part of nature's plan for history, or pursued with hubris, but always with reflexivity <u>The ideals of <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">emancipation that inform progressive politics are guides for judgement and action; without them societies will replicate</span> structural</u> and other <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">oppressions</span></u>, and humanity will never be what it might become.

<em><strong>According to this basic Principle of Distinction, modern humanitarian action is directed towards those who are caught up in violent conflicts without possessing any strategic value for the respective warring parties. Does this imply that classic humanitarianism and its legal expressions reduce the lives of noncombatants to the &quot;bare life&quot; of nameless individuals beyond the protection of any legal order? I would rather argue that <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">humanitarianism</span></u> is itself an order-making activity. Its goal <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">is</span> not the preservation of life reduced to a bare natural fact, but conversely <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">the protection of civilians</span> and thereby the protection of elementary standards of civilization <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">which prevent the exclusion of individuals from any legal and moral order</span></u>. The same holds true for human rights, of course. <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Agamben</span> fails to appreciate the fact that human rights laws are not about some cadaveric &quot;bare life&quot;, but about the protection of moral agency</u>.[33] <u>His sweeping critique</u> also <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">lacks any sense for essential distinctions</span>. It may be legitimate to see &quot;bare life&quot; as a juridical fiction nurtured by the modern state,</u> which claims the right to derogate from otherwise binding norms in times of war and emergency, and to kill individuals, if necessary, outside the law in a mode of &quot;effective factuality.&quot;[34] <u>Agamben asserts that sovereignty understood in this manner continues to function in the same way since the seventeenth century and regardless of the democratic or dictatorial structure of the state in question. This claim remains unilluminated by</u></strong> <u>the <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">wealth of evidence</span> <strong>that <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">shows how</span></strong></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;"> <strong><u>the humanitarian motive not only shapes</u></strong></span> <strong><u>the mandate of a host <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">state and nonstate agencies, but </span></u></strong><u>also serves to restrict the operational freedom of military commanders in democracies<strong>, who cannot act with impunity and who do not wage war in a lawless state of nature</strong></u><strong>.[35] Furthermore, Agamben ignores the crisis of humanitarianism that emerged as a result of the totalitarian degeneration of modern states in the twentieth century. States cannot always be assumed to follow a rational self-interest which informs them that there is no point in killing others indiscriminately. The Nazi episode in European history has shown that sometimes leaders do not spare the weak and the sick, but take eExt.ra care not to let them escape, even if they are handicapped, very old or very young. Classic <u>humanitarianism depends on the existence of an international society whose members feel bound by a basic set of rules regarding the use of violence</u>—rules which the ICRC itself helped to institutionalize. Conversely, classic <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">humanitarianism becomes dysfunctional when states</span> place no value at all on their international reputation and <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">see harming the lives of </span>defenseless <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">individuals</span> not as useless and cruel, but <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">as part of their</span> very <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">mission</span></u>.[36] The founders of the ICRC defined war as an anthropological constant that produced a continuous stream of new victims with the predictable regularity and unavoidability of floods or volcanic eruptions. Newer organizations, by contrast, have framed conditions of massive social suffering as a consequence of largely avoidable political mistakes. The humanitarian movement becomes political, to paraphrase Carl Schmitt,[37] in so far as it orients itself to humanitarian states of emergency, the causes of which are located no longer in nature, but in society and politics. Consequently, the founding generation of the new humanitarian organizations have freed themselves from the ideals of apolitical philanthropy and chosen as their new models historical figures like the Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg, who saved thousands of Jews during the Second World War.[38] <u>In a different fashion than Agamben imagines, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">the primary concern</span> in the field <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">of</span></u> <u>humanitarian intervention and <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">human rights politics</span> today <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">is</span> not the protection of bare life, but rather the <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">rehabilitation of</span> the lived life of <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">citizens who suffer</span></u>, for instance, from conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder. At the same time, there is a field of activity emerging beneath the threshold of the bare life. In the United States, in particular, pathologists working in conjunction with human rights organizations have discovered the importance of corpses and corporal remains now that it is possible to identify reliable evidence for war crimes from exhumed bodies.[39]</strong></em><br />

<em><strong>Here once again we are forced to question Agamben's teleological mode of thought. <u>Is this sovereign power represented in the concentration camps really a constitutive feature of sovereignty</u> tout court? Even limiting ouselves to the remarks above, we can imagine a liberal critique of this position that asks from where come the limitations that Agamben concedes previous Weimar governments had observed. <u>Surely,</u> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">one does not have to accept in its entirety a</span> normative liberal <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">conception of sovereign power</span> in order <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">to appreciate that</span> the demand for a factual accounting for the decision on the exception, and <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">institutional checks upon the totalization of the space of exception, can </span>nonetheless</u> - at least in certain instances - <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">be effective</span>.</u> Indeed, one could go further and suggest <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">that <u>a liberal theory of sovereign power understands</u></span> <u>full well <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">the</span> paradoxical <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">relation between</span></u> law and fact, <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">norm and exception; and</span>, precisely in light of such an understanding constructs an institutional system that cannot resolve the paradox but nonetheless <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">attempts to prevent it from reaching a</span>n intensified and <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">catastrophic conclusion</span></u>. Given that Agamben is a nuanced and fair-minded thinker, one must wonder about why he largely ignores such a system. We think that one possible answer is that, just as for Agamben the source of the problem is not the institutional operation of sovereign power, but its object - bare life - so too the solution is not a proliferation of institutional safeguards but a rethinking of that mode of being. In this regard, we find his concluding musings on Heidigger to be suggestive.</strong></em><br />

<em><strong>The conclusion, then, is that the probability of major war declines for some states, but increases for others. And it is very difficult to argue that it has disappeared in any significant or reliable or hopeful sense. Moreover, a problem with arguing a position that might be described as utopian is that such arguments have policy implications. It is worrying that as a thesis about the obsolescence of major war becomes more compelling to more people, including presumably governments, the tendency will be to forget about the underlying problem, which is not war per se, but security. And <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">by neglecting</span> the <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">underlying problem of security,</span> the <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">probability of war</span> perversely <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">increases: as governments fail to provide the kind of defence</span> and <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">security necessary to maintain deterrence, one opens up</span> the <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">possibility of new challenges</span></u>. In this regard it is worth recalling one of Clauswitz's most important insights: <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">A conqueror</span></u> is always a lover of peace.

<span style="display: block; margin-right: -0.05in; text-align: justify;"><em><strong><span class="Style1Char">When all has been said and done, what is left of realism? For all those who believe in general causal theories the straight forward answer is not much. Certainly there is not enough to keep it going (except as welcome strawman or nuIl-hypothesls for the artIcle industry). Yet despite all, realism is still around. Indeed,</span></strong></em></span><br />
<em><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">we cannot just get rid of realism by proclaiming it dead</span></u><strong>. <span class="Style1Char">The reason for its resiliency, however, is not that it is a generally shared common sense, ‘which goes without saying', nor that it is a well­ defended explanatory theory, although some of its assumptions can be fruitfully employed.</span> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Realism is part of the collective memory and self-definition of international actors</span></u><u>, academics or politicians alike which order thought, suggest analogies, and empower attitudes to political action. Hence, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">it is necessary to engage with realism</span></u><u>,</u> <span class="Style1Char">although this is emphatically not all what needs to be done in International Relations, theory and practice. Only by doing so we can move beyond our main tradition and school of thought.</span> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">One cannot study world politics without understanding the main frame of thought</span></u> <u>within which it has been consciously conducted. Very often the world realism depicts is not out there, but realism is</u>.<span class="Style1Char"> This does not mean that the critical thought developed in all these chap­ters can be forgotten. Indeed, the idea was to open realism up to discussion and to invite the practitioners to more self-criticism, so as to avoid the many possible self-fulfilling prophecies of realism. This chapter has argued that there is no way back to an empiricist realism. Similarly, there is little justified hope in realism as a causal explanatory theory. Its continuing existence points to the thesis which framed this book, that </span><u>we have to understand realism as a historical practice, academic and political, rather than only as a theory</u><span class="Style1Char">. Realism does not passively reflect the world; it does something to it. This line of thought has been proposed mainly by historical sociologists and materialists, as well as constructivist and poststructuralist theories. Realism as a practice has becomes a privileged object of study, not only for this book (George 1994). This section analyses some of the internal critiques, that is those which take realist concerns very seriously. Since we cannot just step out of our tradition,</span> <u>the critical emphasis comes from making realism visible as a practice, and from turning it against the many irresponsible claims committed in its name</u><span class="Style1Char">. The main line of critique can be summarized as follows: realism does not take its central concepts seriously enough. To start with, its critiques claim that realism is a sceptical practice which however, stops short of problema­tizing the inherent theory of the state. It is, second, a practice which informs an international community. Third, international politics is not power poli­tics because it resembles realist precepts, but because the international com­munity which holds a realist world-view acts in such a way as to produce power politics: it is a social construction. </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Realist expectations might hold</span></u><u>, not because they objectively correspond to something out there, but <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">because agents make them the maxims that guide their actions</span></u>.</strong></em><br />

From these foundations, Niebuhr and Morgenthau argue that </span><span class="UnderlineStyleChar">what is true for the individual is also true of the state: because <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">individuals</span> are evil or <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">possess a drive to dominate</span> so too do states because their leaders are individuals who have these motivations argue that realists</span> <u>have a much stronger foundation for the realist argument</u> <span class="Style1Char">than that used by either Morgenthau or Niebuhr. My intent is to present an alternative ultimate cause of classical realism: evolutionary theory. The use of </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">evolutionary theory allows realism to be scientifically grounded</span> for the first time, because evolution explains egoism</u><span class="Style1Char">. Thus</span> <u>a scientific explanation provides a better foundation for their arguments than either theology or metaphysics.</u> <span class="Style1Char">Moreover,</span> <u>evolutionary theory can anchor</u> <span class="Style1Char">the branch of realism termed</span> <u>offensive realism</u> <span class="Style1Char">and advanced most forcefully by John Mearsheimer. He argues that the anarchy of the international system, the fact that there is no world government, forces leaders of states to strive to maximize their relative power in order to be secure. I argue that</span> <u>theorists of international relations must recognize that <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">human evolution occurred in an anarchic environment</span> and that this explains why leaders act as offensive realism predicts. Humans evolved in anarchic conditions, and the implications of this are profound for theories of human behavior</u><span class="Style1Char">. It is also important to note at this point that my argument does not depend upon “anarchy” as it is traditionally used in the discipline - as the ordering principle of the post-1648 Westphalian state system. </span> <u>When human evolution is used to ground offensive realism, it immediately becomes a more powerful theory than is currently recognized. It explains more than just state behavior</u>; <u>it begins to explain human behavior. It applies equally to non-state actors, be they individuals, tribes, or organizations. Moreover, it explains this behavior before the creation of the modern</u> <span class="UnderlineStyleChar">state system. Offensive realists do</span> <u>not need an anarchic state system to advance their argument. They only need</u> <span class="UnderlineStyleChar">humans.</span> <span class="Style1Char">Thus, </span><span class="UnderlineStyleChar">their argument applies equally well before or after 1648, whenever humans form groups, be they tribes in Papua New Guinea, conflicting city-states in ancient Greece, organizations like the Catholic Church, or contemporary states in international relations.</span></strong></em><br />

<em><strong>This is the latest example of the apologies and hand-wringing that occur anytime there is any widespread display of Muslim anger. <u>To listen to most of our foreign-policy commentators, the biggest problem facing America today is the fact that many Muslims are mad at us.</u> &quot;Whatever one's views on the [Iraq] war,&quot; writes a &quot;New York Times&quot; columnist, &quot;thoughtful Americans need to consider . . . the bitter anger that it has provoked among Muslims around the world.&quot; In response to Abu Ghraib, Ted Kennedy lamented, &quot;We have become the most hated nation in the world, as a result of this disastrous policy in the prisons.&quot; <u>Muslim anger over America's support of Israel, we are told, is a major cause of anti-American terrorism</u>. We face, these commentators say, a crisis of &quot;Muslim opinion.&quot; <u>We must, they say, win the &quot;hearts and minds&quot; of angry Muslims by</u> heaping public affection on Islam, by <u>shutting down Guantanamo</u>, by being more &quot;evenhanded&quot; between free Israel and the terrorist Palestinian Authority-<u>-and certainly by avoiding any new military action in the Muslim world. If we fail to win over &quot;Muslim opinion,&quot; we are told, we will drive even more to become terrorists. All of this evades one blatant truth<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">: the hatred being heaped on America is irrational</span> and undeserved</u>. Consider the issue of treatment of POWs. <u>Many Muslims are up in arms about</u> the treatment of prisoners of war in Iraq and at <u>Guantanamo</u>--many of whom were captured on battlefields, trying to kill Americans. <u>Yet these same <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Muslims are silent about the</span> summary convictions and torture--<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">real torture, with electric drills and vats of acid--that are </span>official policy and <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">daily practice throughout the Middle East</span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">.</span> Or consider &quot;Muslim opinion&quot; over the United States' handling of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, in which the United States is accused of not being &quot;hard enough&quot; on Israel--a free nation with laws that protect all citizens, Jew and Arab alike--for Israel's supposed mistreatment of Palestinians. Yet &quot;Muslim opinion&quot; reveres the Palestinian Authority, a brutal dictatorship that deprives Palestinians of every basic freedom, keeps them in unspeakable poverty, and routinely tortures and executes peaceful dissenters. <u>So-called Muslim opinion is not the unanimous and just consensus that its seekers pretend. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">It is the irrational and unjust opinion of the world's worst Muslim</span>s</u>: Islamists and their legions of &quot;moderate&quot; supporters and sympathizers. <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">These people oppose us not because</span> of any legitimate grievances against America, but because <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">they are steeped in a fundamentalist interpretation of their religion</span>--one <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">that views America's freedom</span>, prosperity, and pursuit of worldly pleasures <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">as the height of depravity</span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">.</span> They do not seek respect for the rights of the individual (Muslim or non-Muslim), they seek a world in which the rights of all are sacrificed to the dictates of Islam. <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">The proper response</span></u> to Islamists and their supporters <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">is to identify them as our</span> ideological and political <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">enemies</span>--and dispense justice accordingly. In the case of our militant enemies<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">, we must kill or demoralize them</span></u>--especially those regimes that support terrorism and fuel the Islamist movement; as for the rest, we must politically ignore them and intellectually discredit them, while proudly arguing for the superiority of Americanism. <u>Such a policy would make us safe, expose Islamic anti-Americanism as irrational and immoral, and embolden the better Muslims to support our ideals and emulate our ways</u>. President <u>Bush</u>, like most politicians and intellectuals, <u>has taken the opposite approach to &quot;Muslim opinion&quot;: appeasement.</u> Instead of identifying anti-American Muslims as ideological enemies to be discredited, he has appealed to their sensibilities and met their demands--e.g., sacrificing American soldiers to save Iraqi civilians and mosques. Instead of seeking to crush the Islamists by defeating the causes they fight for--such as Islamic world domination and the destruction of Israel--he has appeased those causes, declaring Islam a &quot;great religion&quot; and rewarding the Palestinian terrorist Jihad with a promised Palestinian state. <u>Instead of destroying terrorist regimes that wage war against the West--</u>including, most notably, Iran--<u>he has sought their &quot;cooperation&quot; and even cast some as &quot;coalition partners.&quot; Such measures have rewarded our enemy for waging physical and spiritual war against us. &quot;Condemn America,&quot; they have learned, &quot;and American leaders will praise your ideals and meet your demands.&quot; &quot;Attack America via terrorist proxy,&quot; terrorist states and movements have been taught, &quot;and America will neither blame you nor destroy you, but redouble its efforts to buy your love.&quot; Every attempt to appease &quot;Muslim opinion&quot; preserves, promotes, and emboldens our enemies. Every concession to angry Muslim mobs gives hope to the Islamist cause. Every day we allow terrorist regimes to exist gives their minions time to execute the next Sept. 11. America needs honest leadership with the courage to identify and defeat our enemies--&quot;Muslim opinion&quot; be damned. They should begin by declaring that <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">militant groups and states that threaten anti-Western violence in response to free speech will be met</span>, not with appeasement, but <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">with destruction</span>.</u></strong></em><br />

<em><strong>Certain critical events in the past remind us of this mordant fact. Looking back on twentieth-century fascism, <u>we do not wring our hands and blame everyone but the Nazis for their murderous policies.</u> Of course, <u>it is important</u> for historians and political analysts <u>to</u> take <u>account of the political</u>, social, and economic <u>milieu out of which National Socialism emerged</u>. <u>But the <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">difficulty and desperation of post–World War I conditions</span></u>—runaway inflation, a war-torn economy, and war reparations, all of which Germany faced—<u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">do not add up to</span> the inevitability</u> of the evil that was <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Nazism.</span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;"> <u>To claim such is to</u></span> set in motion an exculpatory strategy that, whether intentionally or inadvertently,</strong> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">rationalize</span></u><strong>s</strong> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">political pathology</span></u><strong>. The overriding truth and most salient fact of National Socialism is simply stated: A group of people took over state power, aimed to expand an Aryan Empire through ruthless force, and, as dictated by their ideology of biological racism, murdered whole categories of people not because of anything they had done but because of who they were. <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Why, then,</span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;"> i</span>n the context of America's war against terrorism, <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">do so many tick off</span> a list of <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">American &quot;failures</span></u>&quot; <u>or even insist that America brought</u> the horrors of <u>September 11</u>, 2001, on herself? Let me be clear that I exempt from this mode of argument the ludicrous claims that have arisen since that day, such as the slander that Israel carried out the attacks after having first warned Jews who worked in New York's World Trade Center towers to stay home that day, or the preposterous charge that American officials, up to and including the president of the United States, engineered the attacks to bolster their popularity. This sort of inflammatory madness exists outside the boundary of political debate and festers instead in the fever swamps of conspiracy theory. <u>Conducted within the boundary of reasonable political debate,</u> however, <u>are those arguments that</u> an international &quot;war on poverty and despair,&quot; or a change in the direction of U.S. Middle Eastern policy, or <u>a different U.S. policy</u> toward Iraq <u>will stay the hands of murderous terrorists</u> in the future. Certainly these arguments deserve a hearing. Pushing more programs that deal with poverty and despair or rethinking American foreign policy, including our approach to Iraq, may have desirable outcomes. <u>But <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">no</span></u> such <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">change,</span> either <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">singly or together, will deter</span> Osama <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">bin Laden</span></u> and those like him.</strong> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">To believe such is to plunge headfirst into the strategy of denial characteristic of </span>the citizens of Oran in Camus's novel</u><strong>. <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">We could do everything demanded of us by those who are critical of America,</span></u> both inside and outside our boundaries, <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">but Islamist fundamentalism</span> and the threat it poses <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">would not be deterred</span></u>. As do most contemporary commentators, I reserve the terms &quot;Islamist fundamentalism&quot; and &quot;Islamicism&quot; for those who believe in a literal understanding of the Qur'an and condemn all who disagree, Muslim and non-Muslim alike; who have hijacked Islam, in the view of many devout Muslims here and abroad, for their own intolerant purposes; who advocate militant theocracy; and who insist that there can be no distinction between civil law and the strict, fundamentalist Shari'a law, the ancient Islamic holy law. When I claim that changes in our policies would not satisfy Islamists, <u>the reason is</u> quite <u>basic:</u></strong> <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;"><u>They loathe us because of who we are and what our society represents</u></span><strong>. Of course, these radicals indict specific U.S. actions, both now and in the past. For example, in his 1998 declaration of war against America, &quot;Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders,&quot; Osama <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">bin Laden denounces</span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;"> our</span> <u>occupation</u> of the &quot;lands of Islam . . . in the Arabian peninsula.&quot; <u>However</u>, <u>we are</u> also <u>&quot;pagans&quot;</u> in his eyes, finally and irrevocably, and t<u>hat is why he <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">calls &quot;on every Muslim</span></u> who believes in Allah and wishes to be rewarded to comply with Allah's order <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">to kill the Americans</span></u> and plunder their money wherever and whenever they find it.&quot;1 We are so unused to such language that we have a hard time taking it at face value.</strong></em><br />

<em><strong><u>There are <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">those in the academy</span> who <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">respond with the charge of &quot;essentialism</span>&quot; <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">to my claim that we are hated because of who we are</span></u> and what our society represents. To this I have two replies. <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">First, in bin Laden's 1998 fatwa, he invoked</span></u> the Prophet <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Muhammad:</span> &quot;I have been sent with the sword between my hands to ensure that no one but Allah is worshiped</u>, Allah who put my livelihood under the shadow of my spear and who inflicts humiliation and scorn on those who disobey my orders.&quot;2 <u>Bin Laden's gloating about</u> the deaths of three thousand people whose only crime was to go to work on <u>September 11</u>, 2001, is understandable as the vindication of a violent interpretation of a prophetic stance. Those killed were infidels and deserved to perish— hence his joy when both towers of the World Trade Center collapsed, for this represented maximum destruction of &quot;the enemy.&quot; 3 Every civilian death is a tragedy, but not every civilian death is a crime. The deaths on September 11 in New York City, Washington, D.C., and Pennsylvania <u>were both tragic and criminal</u>. <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Contrast the gleeful reaction of bin Laden</span></u> and his cohorts to the collapse of the twin towers <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">with the widely broadcast apologies of America's top military leaders</span></u>, including, on occasion, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, for errant American bombs, whether in Afghanistan or elsewhere, and <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">for any</span></u> and all unintended <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">civilian deaths</span>.</u> These military men understand that civilian deaths are to be avoided if at all possible and that each and every civilian death is an occasion for moral regret and a reexamination of strategy and tactics. <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Second</span></u>, to those who believe that if we change our policies the terror will cease, the answer is straightforward: <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">We can change</span>, through the political process, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">what we do and how we do it in</span></u> the realm of domestic and <u>foreign politics, but we cannot repeal our commitment to personal freedom</u>. <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">We cannot negate the First Amendment</span></u> to the U.S. Constitution, which guarantees the free exercise of religion—any religion. <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">It is an official religion that radical Islamists want</span></u>, and they would impose that official religion everywhere they can, through terror if necessary. <u>Free people argue about the meaning of freedom, but they can do this only because freedom is part of the air they breathe. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Those who despise our freedom</span></u> as the mark of wickedness <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">are not interested in our</span> own <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">ongoing debate</span> about the good and ill uses of freedom</u>. It is freedom itself that they despise. An irony of our post—September 11 world is that some icons of the popular culture whose perceptions many of our own moralists would disdain appear to understand full well what is at stake in this struggle— for example, Neil Young with his song &quot;Let's Roll,&quot; or Bruce Springsteen with his haunting, elegiac songs on The Rising. Written in solidarity with America and in sympathy with the victims of 9/11, Paul McCartney's anthem &quot;Freedom&quot; appreciates that those who believe in freedom must sometimes &quot;fight for the right to live in freedom.&quot; 4 This recognition from so many in popular culture adds piquancy to the disappointing words from many of our intellectuals, academics, and religious leaders: like Camus's &quot;humanists,&quot; they fail to take the measure of the terrible and difficult threats our society faces.</strong></em><br />

<em><strong>BUT <span class="UnderlinedCharChar">NOW VIOLENCE HAS COME CALLING. Now it is no longer possible to live so comfortably in one's own private paradise. Shocked out of the illusion of self-reliance, most of us realize that we, as individuals, simply cannot protect ourselves. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Private life requires public protection</span></span>. Now it is not possible to ignore foreign affairs, because <span class="UnderlinedCharChar"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">foreign affairs have not ignored</span> us</span>. It has become clear that we are living in a world in which <span class="UnderlinedCharChar">hundreds of <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">millions</span> of people <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">hate us, and some</span></span> small percentage of them <span class="UnderlinedCharChar"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">want to destroy</span> us.</span> That realization is bound to have cultural effects.In the first place, we will probably become more conscious of our American-ness. During the blitz in 1940, George Orwell sat in his bomb shelter and wrote an essay called &quot;England Your England.&quot; It opened with this sentence: &quot;As I write, highly civilised human beings are flying overhead, trying to kill me.&quot; What struck him at that moment of danger was that it really does matter whether you are English or German. <span class="UnderlinedCharChar"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">The nation is a nursemaid that breeds certain values and </span>a certain <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">ethos.</span> Orwell went on to describe what it meant to be English. Now Americans are being killed simply because they are Americans</span>.<span style="font-size: 5pt;"> Like Orwell, Americans are once again becoming aware of themselves as a nationality, not just as members of some ethnic community or globalized Internet chat group. Americans have been reminded that, despite what the multiculturalists have been preaching, not all cultures are wonderfully equal hues in the great rainbow of humanity. Some national cultures, the ones that have inherited certain ideas--about freedom and democracy, the limits of the political claims of religion, the importance of tolerance and dissent--are more humane than other civilizations, which reject those ideas.As criticism of our war effort grows in Europe, in hostile Arab countries, and in two-faced countries like Egypt and Saudi Arabia, which dislike our principles but love our dollars, Americans will have to articulate a defense of our national principles and practices. That debate in itself will shape American culture. We will begin to see ourselves against the backdrop of the Taliban. During the Cold War, we saw ourselves in contrast to the Soviet Union. Back then, we faced a godless foe; now we are facing a god-crazed foe. As we recoil from the Islamic eExt.remists, we may be less willing to integrate religion into political life. That would mean trouble for faith-based initiatives and religion in the public square.On the other hand, democracies tend to become patriotic during wartime, if history is any guide, and this will drive an even deeper wedge between regular Americans and the intellectual class. Literary critic Paul Fussell, a great student of American culture in times of war, wrote a book, &quot;Wartime,&quot; on the cultural effects of World War II. Surveying the culture of that period, he endorsed the view of historian Eileen Sullivan, who wrote, &quot;There was no room in this war culture for individual opinions or personalities, no freedom of dissent or approval; the culture was homogeneous, shallow and boring.&quot;The earnest conformity that does prevail in wartime drives intellectuals--who like to think of themselves as witty, skeptical, iconoclastic dissidents--batty. They grow sour, and alienated from mainstream life. For every regular Joe who follows the Humphrey Bogart path in &quot;Casablanca,&quot; from cynicism to idealism, there is an intellectual like Fussell, whose war experiences moved him from idealism to lifetime cynicism.There are other cultural effects. For example, commercial life seems less important than public life, and economic reasoning seems less germane than cultural analysis. When life or death fighting is going on, it's hard to think of Bill Gates or Jack Welch as particularly heroic. Moreover, the cost-benefit analysis dear to economists doesn't really explain much in times of war. Osama bin Laden is not motivated by economic self-interest, and neither are our men and women who are risking their lives to defeat him. To understand such actions, you need to study history, religion, and ethics. The people who try to explain events via economic reasoning begin to look silly. Here is the otherwise intelligent economist Steve Hanke, in Forbes, analyzing bin Laden:&quot;Don't make the mistake of interpreting the events of Sept. 11 purely in terms of terrorism and murder. . . . The terrorists are a virulent subset of a much larger group of anticapitalists, one that includes many politicians, bureaucrats, writers, media types, academics, entertainers, trade unionists and, at times, church leaders. The barbarians at the gates are more numerous than you thought.&quot;BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT CULTURAL EFFECT of conflict is that it breeds a certain bloody-mindedness or, to put it more grandly, a tragic view of life. Life in times of war and recession reminds us of certain hard truths that were easy to ignore during the decade of peace and prosperity. </span><span class="UnderlinedCharChar"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Evil exists</span>. Difficulties, even tragedies, are inevitable. Human beings are flawed creatures capable of monstrosity. Not all cultures are compatible. To preserve order, good people must exercise power over destructive people.That means that <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">it's no longer sufficient to deconstruct ideas and teExt.s</span> and signifiers. You have to be able to construct hard principles so you can move from one idea to the neExt., because when you are faced with the problem of repelling evil, you absolutely must be able to reach a conclusion on serious moral issues.</span>This means you need to think in moral terms about force--and to be tough-minded. During the Cold War, Reinhold Niebuhr was a major intellectual figure. In 1952, he wrote &quot;The Irony of American History.&quot; The tragedy of the conflict with communism, he argued, was that, &quot;though confident of its virtue, <span class="UnderlinedCharChar">[<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">America] must yet hold atomic bombs ready for use so as to prevent a possible world conflagration</span>.&quot; The irony of our history, he continued, is that we are an idealistic nation that dreams of creating a world of pure virtue, yet in defeating our enemies we sometimes have to act in ways that are not pure. &quot;We take, and must continue to take, morally hazardous action to preserve our civilization,&quot; Niebuhr wrote. &quot;We must exercise our power.&quot; We have to do so while realizing that we will not be capable of perfect disinterestedness when deciding which actions are just. We will be influenced by dark passions. But we still have to act forcefully because our enemies are trying to destroy the basis of civilization: &quot;We are drawn into an historic situation in which the paradise of our domestic security is suspended in a hell of global insecurity</span>.&quot;Niebuhr's prescription was humble hawkishness. He believed the United States should forcefully defend freedom and destroy its enemies. But while doing so, it should seek forgiveness for the horrible things it might have to do in a worthy cause.To reach this graduate-school level of sophistication, you have to have passed through elementary courses in moral reasoning. It will be interesting to see whether we Americans, who sometimes seem unsure of even the fundamental moral categories, can educate ourselves sufficiently to engage in the kind of moral reasoning that Niebuhr did.THE GREATEST POLITICAL EFFECT of this period of conflict will probably be to relegitimize central institutions. <span class="UnderlinedCharChar">Since we can't defend ourselves as individuals against terrorism, we <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">have to rely on the institutions of government</span>: the armed forces, the FBI, the CIA, the CDC, and so o</span>n. We are now only beginning to surrender some freedoms, but we will trade in more, and willingly. As Alexander Hamilton wrote in the Federalist Papers, &quot;Safety from eExt.ernal danger is the most powerful director of national conduct. Even the ardent love of liberty will, after a time, give way to its dictates. . . . To be more safe, [people] at length become willing to run the risk of being less free.&quot; Moreover, we will see power migrate from the states and Capitol Hill to the White House. &quot;It is of the nature of war to increase the executive at the expense of the legislative authority,&quot; Hamilton continued.This creates rifts on both left and right, because both movements contain anti-establishment elements hostile to any effort to relegitimize central authorities. The splits have been most spectacular on the left. Liberals who work in politics--Democrats on Capitol Hill, liberal activists, academics who are interested in day-to-day politics--almost all support President Bush and the war effort. But many academic and literary leftists, ranging from Eric Foner to Susan Sontag to Noam Chomsky, have been sour, critical, and contemptuous of America's response to September 11. The central difference is that the political liberals are comfortable with power. They want power themselves and do not object to the central institutions of government, even the military, exercising power on our behalf.Many literary and <span class="UnderlinedCharChar"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">academic liberals</span></span>, on the other hand<span class="UnderlinedCharChar">, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">have built a whole moral system around powerlessness</span></span>. They champion the outgroups. <span class="UnderlinedCharChar">They stand with the victims of hegemony, patriarchy, colonialism, and all the other manifestations of central authority. Sitting on their campuses, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">they are powerless</span> themselves, and have embraced a delicious, self-glorifying identity</span> as the outmanned sages who alone can see through the veils of propaganda in which the powerful hide their oppressive schemes. For these thinkers, virtue inheres in the powerless. The weak are sanctified, not least because they are voiceless and allegedly need academics to give them voices. These outgroup leftists dislike the Taliban, but to ally themselves with American power would be to annihilate everything they have stood for and the role they have assigned themselves in society.</strong></em><br />

<br />
<em><strong>That call to retreat <span style="font-size: 8pt;">was rejected by most of American conservatism (as Pat Buchanan has amply demonstrated by his very marginality). But it </span>did find some resonance in mainstream liberalism. At first, however, only</strong></em> <strong>some</strong> <em><strong>resonance. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">As noted earlier, the liberal internationalism of the 1990s, the center-left Clintonian version, was reluctant to fully embrace American hegemony and did try to rein it in by creating Ext.ernal restraints. Nonetheless, in practice, it did boldly intervene in the Balkan wars (without the sanction of the Security Council, mind you) and openly accepted a kind of intermediate status as &quot;the indispensable nation.&quot; Not today</span>. The ascendant <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">New Liberalism</span> goes much further, actively <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">seeking to subsume America within the international community</span>--</strong></em><strong>inter pares<em>, not even</em> primus//--<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">and to enact a domestic social agenda to suit</span>. So why not? <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Why not choose</span> ease and bask in the adulation of the world as we serially renounce, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">withdraw, and concede</span>? <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Because</span>, while globalization has produced in some the illusion that human nature has changed, it has not. T<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">he international arena remains a Hobbesian state of nature in which countries naturally strive for power. </span></strong>If we voluntarily renounce much of ours, others will not follow suit. <strong>They will fill the vacuum. Inevitably, an inversion of power relations will occur. Do we really want to live under unknown, untested, shifting <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">multipolarity</span>? Or even worse, under the gauzy internationalism of the New Liberalism with its magically self-enforcing norms? This is sometimes passed off as &quot;realism.&quot; In fact, it <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">is the worst of utopianisms, a fiction that can lead only to chaos</span>. Indeed, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">in an age on the threshold of hyper-proliferation, it is a prescription for catastrophe</span>. Heavy are the burdens of the hegemon. After the blood and treasure expended in the post-9/11 wars, America is quite ready to ease its burden with a gentle descent into abdication and decline.</strong> <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Decline is a choice</span><strong>. More than a choice, a temptation. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">How to resist it? First, accept our role as hegemon</span>. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">And </span></strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">reject those who deny its essential benignity</span><strong>. There is a reason that we are the only hegemon in modern history to have not immediately catalyzed the creation of a massive counter-hegemonic alliance--as occurred, for example, against Napoleonic France and Nazi Germany. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">There is a reason so many countries of the Pacific Rim and the Middle East and Eastern Europe and Latin America welcome our presence as balancer of power and guarantor of their freedom. And that reason is simple</span>: We are as benign a hegemon as the world has ever seen. So,</strong> <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">resistance to decline begins with moral self-confidence and will</span><strong>. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">But maintaining dominance is a matter not just of will but of wallet. We are not inherently in economic decline. We have the most dynamic, innovative, technologically advanced economy in the world. We enjoy the highest productivity. It is true that in the natural and often painful global division of labor wrought by globalization, less skilled endeavors like factory work migrate abroad, but America more than compensates by pioneering the newer technologies and industries of the information age</span>. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">There are, of course</span>, major <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">threats to the American economy. But there is nothing inevitable</span> and inexorable about them. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Take, for example, the</span> threat to the dollar (<span style="font-size: 8pt;">as the world's reserve currency) that comes</span> from our massive trade deficits. Here again, the <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">China threat is vastly exaggerated</span>. In fact, fully two-thirds of our trade imbalance comes from imported oil. This is not a fixed fact of life. We have a choice. We have it in our power, for example, to reverse the absurd de facto 30-year ban on new nuclear power plants. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">We have it in our power to release huge domestic petroleum reserves by dropping the ban on offshore and Arctic drilling</span>. We have it in our power to institute a serious gasoline tax (refunded immediately through a payroll tax reduction) to curb consumption and induce conservation.</strong> <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Nothing is written. Nothing is predetermined</span><strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">. We can reverse the slide, we can undo dependence if we will it.</span> The other looming threat to our economy--and to the dollar--comes from our <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">fiscal deficits</span>. They are <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">not out of our control</span>. There is no reason we should be structurally perpetuating the massive deficits incurred as temporary crisis measures during the financial panic of 2008. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">A crisis is a terrible thing to exploit when it is taken by</span> the New <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Liberalism</span> as a mandate for massive expansion of the state and of national debt--<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">threatening the dollar,</span> the entire economy, and consequently our superpower status abroad. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">There are things to be done. Resist </span></strong>retreat as a matter of strategy and principle**. And provide the means to continue our dominant role in the world by keeping our economic house in order. And finally, we can follow the advice of Demosthenes when asked what was to be done about the decline of Athens. His reply? &quot;I will give what I believe is the fairest and truest answer: Don't do what you are doing now.&quot;
