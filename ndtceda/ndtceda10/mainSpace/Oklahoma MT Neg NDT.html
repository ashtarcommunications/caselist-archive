NDT round 5 vs MSU HR-- h1bs with afghan stability and hegemony <br />
<br />
<br />

 The 1ac relies on notions of economics, science, and ethics which assume an inherently selfish subject that makes ethics impossible and necessitate and endless series of disciplinary measures that are doomed to fail  <br />
Riker 10 (john, <em><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">why it is good to be good</span></em>, p 10-11) <br />
<br />
Modernity’s beliefs about the self and self-interest: if we try to unpack how… there is little chance of getting caught?  <br />
<br />
<br />
The models used for their projections are the same ones that failed to predict the financial crisis. Their assumptions that everyone behaves rationally and identically make economic collapse inevitable  <br />
Stiglitz 10 (joseph, “needed: a new economic paradigm”) <br />
<br />
The blame game continues over who is responsible… is the stability and prosperity of our economies.  <br />
<br />
Economic modernity fuels immature narcissism  <br />
Riker 10 (john, <em><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">why it is good to be good</span></em>, p 13-14) <br />
The modem tendency to consider oneself the final…. If this is the easiest way to get what they want  <br />
<br />
<br />
The mindset of economic competitiveness creates a society which requires ethics to function while simultaneously depriving them of their foundation  <br />
Riker 10 (john, <em><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">why it is good to be good</span></em>, p 2-3) <br />
However, from the very beginning, the validity of this argument… members toward this orientation.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Injuries to the self cause narcissistic rage, which is the primary cause of all large scale violence and cumulates in infinite annihilation  <br />
Riker 10 (john, <em><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">why it is good to be good</span></em>, p 32-33) <br />
Being mistaken about one’s ideals, ambitions… victims for destruction.  <br />
<br />
<br />
The alt is to reject he affs economic conception of self: this is key to open up space for a kohutian conception of the self, which is the only way to create a foundation for ethical action  <br />
Riker 10 (john, <em><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">why it is good to be good</span></em>, p ix-xi) <br />
The aim of this book is to provide… a significant new moral psychology.  <br />

 <br />
The visa is a form of conditional hospitality that relies on an invitation that replicates the domination of the master  <br />
Derrida 1 (theory and event 5.1 project muse)  <br />
<br />
Than you. Let me start with, let’s say, a very well located… hospitality should be, in principle.  <br />
<br />
<br />
This effort at equality and justice is a clever ruse of the majority this narcissistic hegemony guarantee  <br />
Arrigo and Williams 2k  <br />
The impediments to establishing democratic… affirmative postmodern thought.8  <br />
<br />
<br />
Ethics precede political calculations  <br />
Carroll 7  <br />
To acknowledge the priority… undermining and dismantling it.  <br />
<br />
Justice is the only impact—you should risk danger in order to achieve and ethical relationship with the other  <br />
Weber 5  <br />
This provocative assertion, from derrida’s force of law… from “bare life.”  <br />
