<span style="font-size: 8pt;">When does a rising power become a threat? There is seldom a single moment. A century ago, </span><u>AngloGerman antagonism</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> was still a relatively new phenomenon; an alliance between the two empires seemed plausible as late as 1899. Likewise, the United States took time to identify Japan as a serious rival in the Pacific region; it was not until the 1930s that relations really soured. In both cases, the perception of a strategic threat </span><u>was</u> <u>slow to grow. But grow it did</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">—</span><u>and ultimately it led to war</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>Could the same be happening to <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the</span></u> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">U</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">nited </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">S</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">tates </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">and China</span> today</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">? </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Are</span> we</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> imperceptibly but inexorably </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">slipping from cooperation to competition</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">? Back in early 2007, </span><u>it seemed as if China and America were so intertwined they'd become one economy</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">: I called it &quot;Chimerica.&quot; The Chinese did the saving, the Americans the spending. The Chinese did the exporting, the Americans the importing. The Chinese did the lending, the Americans the borrowing. As </span><u>the Chinese</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> strategy was based on export-led growth, they </span><u>had no desire to see their currency appreciate against the dollar</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>So they intervened</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> consistently </span><u>in currency markets</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and as a result, they now have international reserves totaling $2.1 trillion. About 70 percent of these are in dollar-denominated securities, and a large proportion of these are in U.S. government bonds. The unintended effect of this was to help finance the U.S. current-account deficit at very low interest rates. Without those low long-term rates, it's hard to believe that the U.S. -real-estate market would have bubbled the way it did between 2002 and 2007. For a time </span><u>Chimerica seemed like a marriage made in heaven</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">: </span><u>both</u> <u>economies</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">grew so fast that they </span><u>accounted for about 40 percent of</u> <u>global growth</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> between 1998 and 2007. The big question now is whether or not </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">this marriage is on the rocks</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. America's highly indebted consumers just can't borrow anymore. The U.S. savings rate is soaring upward, and U.S. imports from China have slumped, down 18 percent between May 2008 and May 2009. Of course, that doesn't mean the Chinese are going to stop buying dollars. They dare not allow their currency to appreciate when so many jobs in the export sector are under threat. But it does mean that they are questioning the Chimerica strategy. It ' s a bit like one of those marriages between a compulsive saver and a chronic spender. Such partnerships can work for a certain period of time, but eventually the penny-pincher gets disillusioned with the spendthrift. Every time Chinese officials express concern about U.S. fiscal or monetary policy, it reminds me of one of those domestic tiffs in which the saver says to the spender: &quot;You maxed out on the credit cards once too often, honey.&quot; Let's look at the numbers. China's holdings of U.S. Treasuries rose to $801.5 billion in May, an increase of 5 percent from $763.5 billion in April. Call it $40 billion a month. And let's imagine the Chinese do that every month through this fiscal year. That would be a credit line to the U.S. government of $480 billion. Given that the total deficit is forecast to be about $2 trillion, that means the Chinese may finance less than a quarter of -total federal-government borrowing—whereas a few years ago they were financing virtually the whole deficit. The trouble is that the Chinese clearly feel they have enough U.S. government bonds. Their great anxiety is that the Obama administration's very lax fiscal policy, plus the Federal Reserve's policy of quantitative easing (in layman's terms, printing money), are going to cause one or both of two things to happen: the price of U.S. bonds could fall and/or the purchasing power of the dollar could fall. Either way the Chinese lose. Their current strategy is to shift their purchases to the short end of the yield curve, buying Treasury bills instead of 10-year bonds. But that doesn't address the currency risk. In a best-selling book titled Currency Wars, Chinese economist Song Hongbing warned that the United States has a bad habit of stiffing its creditors by letting the dollar slide. This, he points out, is what happened to the Japanese in the 1980s. First their currency strengthened against the dollar. Then their economy tanked. </span><u>What is <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">China's</span> alternative</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> if it seeks a divorce from America? </span><u>Call it</u> <u>the <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">empire option</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>Instead of continuing</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in this unhappy marriage, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the Chinese</span></u> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">can</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> go it alone, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">count</span>i</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">ng </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">on their</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> growing </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">economic might</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (according to Goldman Sachs, China's gross domestic product could equal that of the United States by 2027) </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">to buy them</span> global <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">power</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in their own right. In some ways they've already begun doing this. </span><u>Their <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">naval</span></u> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">strategy</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> clearly </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">implies a challenge to U.S. heg</span>emony</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in the Asia-Pacific region. </span><u>Their <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">investments in Africa</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">n minerals and infrastructure </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">look distinctly imperial</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> too. And now </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the official line</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> from Prime Minister Wen Jiabao </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">is to &quot;hasten the implementation of</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> our </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">'going out'</span></u> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">strategy</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and combine the utilization of foreign exchange reserves with the 'going out' of our enterprises.&quot; That sounds like a Chinese campaign to buy up foreign assets—</span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">exchanging </span>dodgy <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">dollars for copper mines</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. At the same time, crucially, the Chinese need to have their own domestic consumers step up to take the place of over leveraged Americans. China's economy is, above all, a manufacturing concern; if no one is going to the shopping malls, China's companies are just building their inventories. So a post-Chimerican China needs to be not only an empire, but also a consumer society. This will boost China's internal market as well as trade with its Asian neighbors, and will spur the development of an Asian economic bloc. </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">The</span> global <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">implications</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of this divorce </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">are huge</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Imagine a new Cold War</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, but one in which the two superpowers are economically the same size. Or, if you prefer an older analogy, imagine a rerun of the Anglo-German antagonism of the early 1900s, with America in the role of Britain, and China in the role of imperial Germany. This is a better analogy because it captures the fact that </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">a high level of economic integration does not</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">necessarily</span> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">prevent</span> the growth of <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">strategic rivalry and</span>, ultimately, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">conflict</span>.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">We are a very long way from outright warfare, of course. The tectonic plates of geopolitics don't move that fast. But the danger signs are there. In a succession of official and semi-official statements, </span><u>Chinese spokesmen have signaled their interest in a substitute for the dollar</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in the form of International Monetary Fund Special Drawing Rights, or even gold. At the very least, a gradual increase in the share of euros and yen in Chinese reserves must surely be in the cards. But they could go further than that. </span><u>It's not impossible that</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, at some point within the next five to 10 years, </span><u>the Chinese will feel ready to remove their capital controls and allow their own currency</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, the renminbi, </span><u>to develop</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> as a </span><u>freely</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> convertible international currency. At that point, the Chimerican marriage will be over. Not too surprising, really. As the name implied, such an unbalanced relationship was always something of chimera.</span><br />

According to General Matthew Ridgeway, commander of the US Eighth Army which fought against the Chinese in the Korean War, the US had at the time thought of using nuclear weapons against China to save the US from military defeat. In his book The Korean War, a personal account of the military and political aspects of the conflict and its implications on future US foreign policy, Gen Ridgeway said that US was confronted with two choices in Korea -- truce or a broadened war, which could have led to the use of nuclear weapons. If the US had to resort to nuclear weaponry to defeat China long before the latter acquired a similar capability, there is little hope of winning a war against China 50 years later, short of using nuclear weapons. The US estimates that China possesses about 20 nuclear warheads that can destroy major American cities. Beijing also seems prepared to go for the nuclear option. A Chinese military officer disclosed recently that Beijing was considering a review of its “non first use” principle regarding nuclear weapons. Major-General Pan Zhangqiang, president of the military-funded Institute for Strategic Studies, told a gathering at the Woodrow Wilson International Centre for Scholars in Washington that although the government still abided by that principle, there were strong pressures from the military to drop it. He said military leaders considered the use of nuclear weapons mandatory if the country risked dismemberment as a result of foreign intervention. Gen Ridgeway said that should that come to pass,</span> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-size: 11pt;">we would see <strong>the</strong></span></u><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">destruction of civilisation</span></strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. There would be no victors in such a war. While </span><u>the prospect of a nuclear Armaggedon</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> over Taiwan might seem inconceivable, it </span><u>cannot be ruled out</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> entirely, for China puts sovereignty above everything else</span>.<br />

<u>Many American high-tech workers oppose raising the H-1B cap, fearing that increasing the supply of skilled workers could reduce their wages. When companies cannot hire as many highly skilled workers as they need, competition drives wages up, so raising the visa cap may indeed cause the wages of some Americans to fall or stagnate. Why, then, should Americans favor higher numbers of H-1B employees? Because <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">raising the visa cap would <strong><em>increase</em> wage</strong>s for <strong><em>many more Americans</em></strong> than would see their wages fall</span>.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Since each H-1B worker creates four new American jobs, the demand for such somewhat less-skilled but necessary workers would raise their wages. </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">The number of workers in the economy whose skills complement the advanced skills of H-1B workers is <strong>far greater</strong> than the number of those who compete with them for jobs.

Businesses competing for the limited supply of these skilled workers have driven their wages up sharply.

<span class="underlinedChar"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-size: 10.5pt;">Less-skilled men and women have fallen progressively further behind their more skilled brothers and sisters</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">; completing a high school degree no longer allows access to jobs that pay middle-income wages. In this sense, </span><span class="underlinedChar"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">the job market has gotten tougher for both low-skilled men and low-skilled women.</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> But other changes among women – growing work experience, greater returns to experience, and a reduced trade-off between children and wages – have offset these problems and led to somewhat greater wage increases among less-skilled women. While the evidence suggests that less-skilled women are doing better than similar men, I do not want to paint a rosy picture of the low-wage labor market for women. Because women’s wages are lower than men’s, they often earn very low incomes while struggling to meet the demands of their employers, caring for their children, and organizing child care during work. One group in particular appears to be struggling the most. A group of highly disadvantaged single mothers seems to be facing particularly low incomes. This group – often referred to as “disconnected” -- is neither working nor on welfare. Most disturbing, this group has been growing rapidly post-welfare reform. Currently, 20 to 25% of single mothers report themselves as neither working nor on welfare, double the number only 10 years ago.9 This group is very poor. Only half of these mothers live with another adult, and even those who do have low household incomes. Research suggests that this disconnected group is largely composed of women who have left welfare but who have multiple disadvantages or barriers to work, including low skills, health problems and especially problems with depression, responsibility for a child or adult with health problems, substance abuse problems, and current or past experience with domestic violence. The more such “barriers” a women faces in her life, the less likely that she is able to find and keep a stable job.10 Unfortunately, cash assistance through welfare has become increasingly unavailable to these women as well. This population is most likely to be either time-limited from welfare or sanctioned for non-compliance with welfare rules. I am deeply concerned about this quarter of single-mother families – and their children! – that have not succeeded in making a stable transition from welfare to work and who are able to work only sporadically or part-time. </span><span class="underlinedChar"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">This is a group for whom <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">we need to</span> rethink our policies, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">re-creat</span>ing <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">a safety net </span>that can help provide economic stability to this group of women and children</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The Impact of Inequality It is, of course, worth noting that Figures 3 and 4 indicate strong and continuous increases in wages among the college educated. </span><span class="underlinedChar"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">The demand for more-educated workers has grown strongly over the past 25 years, while the demand for less-skilled workers has not.</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> This rising inequality in wages is reflected in rises in household income inequality as well, although income inequality has not increased as much as wage inequality. This is because more adults in poor households are working today than in past decades, hence increases in hours of work are offsetting relative wage changes.11 Rising inequality has been correlated with a variety of economic shifts in the U.S. economy. Shifts in demand have privileged more-skilled workers, relative to their less-skilled brothers and sisters. These demand shifts are due to changes in technology and in the global competition for workers.12 </span><span class="underlinedChar"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">More-educated U.S. workers – and we have the best group of highly-educated workers in the world – have gained enormously from the expanding and increasingly interconnected international economy and from the new technologies in information and communication. Less-educated workers have gained much less from these changes. Why should we care about rising inequality? There are at least three reasons. First, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">there is a sense of economic deprivation </span>among lower income families, as they watch others move further ahead. </span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Tuition for higher education is increasing faster than inflation; housing prices and rents in many areas of the country have increased much faster than overall prices. Health care is almost impossible to purchase on the open market, if not provided by one’s employer. </span><span class="underlinedChar"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Lower-wage workers in today’s economy find it hard to achieve those things that are part of the American dream…your own house, a job with pension and health benefits, or the opportunity to send your children to college. Second, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">economic inequality is deeply linked with other types of social inequality</span></span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Health disparities between more and less-educated workers have widened over the past few decades. Differences in educational achievement are widening between the best and worst students. </span><span class="underlinedChar"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">These social inequalities only reinforce economic inequality.</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> More troublesome, they may limit opportunities for the children of today’s lower wage workers. </span><span class="underlinedChar"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Economic mobility has always been an important promise in America.</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> But widening inequality makes it harder for the children growing up in today’s low-income families to dream about doing better. In fact, quite a bit of evidence now suggests that economic mobility is greater in many European countries than it is in the United States.13 </span><span class="underlinedChar"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Third, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">economic inequality and a sense of relative deprivation can have negative effects on the civic and the political realm.</span></span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The economic experiences of the past two decades are very different for those with a college education than for those with only a high school education. This makes it hard to engage in a common conversation about economic problems and their solutions. </span><span class="underlinedChar"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;">Fear of technological change and of growing economic internationalization is fueling a backlash that can lead to bad policies that limit future economic growth. Public discussions of social security reform or health insurance reform are hard to hold when the bottom third of the population has only social security and Medicare to rely on in old age</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, while the top third has extensive market investments and long-term supplemental health coverage through their job. In short, </span><span class="underlinedChar"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-size: 10.5pt;">economic inequality makes it harder to solve our common problems and harder to evoke a sense of common purpose and experience</span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-size: 10.5pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt;"> This is not only inconvenient for politicians; it can threaten the civic nature of public debate in a democracy</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Inequality is an inherent and necessary part of any market economy, but the sharp rises in relative well-being between different groups in the current economy is very troublesome. High and rising levels of inequality are a social and economic problem that will limit economic and policy progress on many fronts.</span><br />

Corruption, of course, can hurt growth by reducing the efficient allocation of public and private resources and by distorting investment</u>. That may end up creating asset price bubbles. <u>Unchecked inequality may also tend to create still more inequality</u>.

<span style="margin-left: 0in;"><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">The decline of the public sphere in late twentieth-century America poses a series of great dilemmas and challenges. Many ideological currents</span> scrutinized here - localism, metaphysics, spontaneism, post- modernism, Deep Ecology - <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">intersect with and reinforce each other</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. While these currents have deep origins in popular movements of the 1960s and 1970s, they remain very much alive in the 1990s. </span><u>Despite</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> their </span><u>different outlooks</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and trajectories, </span><u>they all share</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> one thing in common: </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">a depoliticized expression of struggles to combat and over- come alienation. </span>The false sense of empowerment that comes with such mesmerizing impulses is accompanied by a loss of public engagement, an erosion of citizenship and a depleted capacity of individuals</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in large groups </span><u>to work for social change</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>As this ideological quagmire worsens, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">urgent problems that are destroying the fabric of American society will go unsolved</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">- perhaps even unrecognized - only to fester more ominously into the future. And </span><u>such problems (ecological crisis, poverty, urban decay, spread of infectious diseases, technological displacement of workers)</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> cannot be understood outside the larger social and global context of internationalized markets, finance, and communications. Paradoxically, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the widespread retreat from politics, often inspired by localist sentiment, comes at a time when agendas that ignore or side- step these global realities will, more than ever, be reduced to impotence</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In his commentary on the state of citizenship today, </span><u>Wolin refers to the increasing sublimation and dilution of politics, as larger numbers of people turn away from public concerns toward private ones. By diluting the life of common involvements, we negate the very idea of politics as a source of public ideals and visions.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">74 </span><u>In the meantime, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the <strong>fate of the world hangs in the balance</strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The unyielding truth is that, </span><u>even as the ethos of anti-politics becomes more compelling</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and even </span><u>fashionable in the United States, it is the vagaries of political power that will continue to decide the fate of human societies</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. This last point demands further elaboration. </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">The shrinkage of politics hardly means that corporate colonization will be less of a reality, that social hierarchies will somehow disappear, or that gigantic state and military structures will lose their hold over people's lives. Far from it: the space abdicated by a broad citizenry, well-informed and ready to participate at many levels, can in fact be filled by authoritarian and reactionary elites</span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-size: 8pt;"> - </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">an already familiar dynamic in many lesser- developed countries</span>.</u> <u>The fragmentation and chaos of a Hobbesian world,</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> not very far removed from the rampant individualism, social Darwinism, and civic violence that have been so much a part of the American landscape, </span><u>could be the prelude to a powerful Leviathan designed to impose order in the face of disunity and atomized retreat</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In this way the eclipse of politics might set the stage for a reassertion of politics in more virulent guise - or it might help further rationalize the existing power structure. </span><u>In either case, the state would likely become what Hobbes anticipated: the embodiment of those universal, collective interests that had vanished from civil society</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span></span><br />

If it does, efforts at immigration reform will be either be ignored or shunted aside into diversionary debates over the actual intentions of the proponents.

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">By the same token, </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">xenophilic demagoguery also serves no useful purpose for public discussions of immigration reforms.</span></u></strong> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Immigration is</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, as mentioned earlier, </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">fundamentally an economic issue</span></u></strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;"> in terms of its societal impacts.</span></u> <strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Exaggerated and uncritical assertions that proclaim the merits of more immigrants while ignoring their fiscal and opportunity costs on the receiving countries does little to further public debate</span></u></strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-size: 8pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The mere existence of labor shortages —locally, regionally or nationally—does not mean that more immigration is necessary or desirable as a policy response. Tight labor markets can provide opportunities to direct public attention to the inadequacies of domestic training, education, and labor mobility programs, as well as being chances to re-examine the state of prevailing antidiscrimination efforts that assure that available human resource reservoirs are fully tapped. Furthermore, such efforts at human-resource development can reduce the tendency of expanded immigration to “brain-drain” skilled labor from developing nations where such supplies are always chronically short. Increasing the level of immigration is one way to meet real labor shortages; but it is not the only one or necessarily the preferred first option.</span><br />

The world's population soared. We saw the creation of the middle class. We saw the poor improve their plight and change their own class identification. </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">The <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">empirical truth</span> has never been hard to come by</span></u></strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">What matters are the theoretical eyes that see</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>This</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> is what </span><u>dictates the lesson we draw from events</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Marx and Bastiat</span> were writing at the same time</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.

What was the difference between them? </span><u>They <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">saw the same facts</span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-size: 8pt;">, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">but</span> they saw them <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">in</span> very <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">different ways</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. They had a different perception of cause and effect. I suggest to you that </span><u>there is an important lesson here <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">as regards <strong>the <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">methodology</span> of the social sciences</strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span><u>as well as an agenda and strategy for the future</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>Concerning method</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, we need to recognize that </span><u>Mises was precisely right concerning the relationship between facts and economic truth</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">If we have a solid theory in mind</span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-size: 8pt;">, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">the facts on the ground provide excellent illustrative material</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. They inform us about the application of theory in the world in which we live. They provided excellent anecdotes and revealing stories of how economic theory is confirmed in practice. </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">But absent that theory of economics</span></u></strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-size: 8pt;">, </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">facts alone are nothing but facts</span></u></strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">They do not convey <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">any information about cause and effect</span></span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span><u>and they do not point a way forward</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Think of it this way. Let's say you have a bag of marbles that is turned upside down on the ground. Ask two people their impressions. The first one understands what numbers mean, what shapes mean, and what colors mean. This person can give a detailed account of what he sees: how many marbles, what kinds, how big they are, and this person can explain what he sees in different ways potentially for hours. But now consider the second person, who, we can suppose, has absolutely no understanding of numbers, not even that they exist as abstract ideas. This person has no comprehension of either shape or color. He sees the same scene as the other person but cannot provide anything like an explanation of any patterns. He has very little to say. All he sees is a series of random objects. Both these people see the same facts. But they understand them in very different ways, owing to the abstract notions of meaning that they carry in their minds. This is why positivism as pure science, a method of assembling a potentially infinite series of data points, is a fruitless undertaking. Data points on their own convey no theory, suggest no conclusions, and offer no truths. To arrive at truth requires the most important step that we as human beings can ever take: thinking. Through this thinking, and with good teaching and reading, we can put together a coherent theoretical apparatus that helps us understand. Now, </span><u>we have a hard time conjuring</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> up </span><u>in our minds</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the likes of </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">a</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> man <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">[</span></span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">person</span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-size: 8pt;">] </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">who has no comprehension of</span> numbers</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">colors</span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-size: 8pt;">, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">or shapes</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. And </span><u>yet</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> I suggest to you that </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">this is</span> precisely <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">what we are facing when</span> we encounter <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">a person</span> who has <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">never thought about economic theory and never studied the implications of the science</span> at all</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">The facts of the world look</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> quite </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">random to this person</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. He sees two societies next to each other, one free and prosperous and the other unfree and poor. He looks at this and concludes nothing important about economic systems because he has never thought hard about the relationship between economic systems and prosperity and freedom. He merely accepts the existence of wealth in one place and poverty in the other as a given, the same way the socialists at a lunch table assumed that the luxurious surroundings and food just happened to be there. </span><u>Perhaps <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">they will reach for an explanation</span> of some sort</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">but <strong>absent economic education</strong></span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-size: 8pt;">, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">it is not likely to be</span> the <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">correct </span>one</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Equally as dangerous as having no theory is having a bad theory that is assembled not by means of logic but by an incorrect view of cause and effect. This is the case with notions such as the Phillips Curve, which posits a tradeoff relationship between inflation and unemployment. The idea is that you can drive unemployment down very low if you are willing to tolerate high inflation; or it can work the other way around: you can stabilize prices provided you are willing to put up with high unemployment. Now, of course this makes no sense on the microeconomic level. When inflation is soaring, businesses don't suddenly say, hey, let's hire a bunch of new people! Nor do they say, you know, the prices we pay for inventory have not gone up or have fallen. Let's fire some workers! This much is true about macroeconomics: It is commonly treated like a subject completely devoid of any connection to microeconomics or even human decision making. It is as if we enter into a video game featuring fearsome creatures called Aggregates that battle it out to the death. So you have one creature called Unemployment, one called Inflation, one called Capital, one called Labor, and so on until you can construct a fun game that is sheer fantasy. Another example of this came to me just the other day. A recent study claimed that labor unions increase the productivity of firms. How did the researchers discern this? They found that unionized companies tend to be larger with more overall output than nonunionized companies. Well, let's think about this. Is it likely that if you close a labor pool to all competition, give that restrictive labor pool the right to use violence to enforce its cartel, permit that cartel to extract higher-than-market wages from the company and set its own terms concerning work rules and vacations and benefits — is it likely that this will be good for the company in the long run? You have to take leave of your senses to believe this. In fact, what we have here is a simple mix-up of cause and effect. Bigger companies tend to be more likely to attract a kind of unpreventable unionization than smaller ones. The unions target them, with federal aid. It is no more or less complicated than that. It is for the same reason that developed economies have larger welfare states. The parasites prefer bigger hosts; that's all. We would be making a big mistake to assume that the welfare state causes the developed economy. That would be as much a fallacy as to believe that wearing $2,000 suits causes people to become rich. I'm convinced that Mises was right: </span><u>the most important step economists or economic institutions can take is in the direction of public education in economic logic</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. There is another important factor here. </span><strong><u>The state thrives on an economically ignorant public</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. This is the only way it can get away with blaming inflation or recession on consumers, or claiming that the government's fiscal problems are due to our paying too little in taxes. </span><u>It</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> is economic ignorance that </span><u>permits</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the </span><u>regulatory agencies to claim that they are protecting us</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> as versus </span><u>denying us choice</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. It is </span><u>only by keeping us all in the dark</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> that </span><u>it can</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> continue to </span><strong><u>start <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">war after war</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> — </span><strong><u>violating rights abroad and smashing liberties at home</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> — in the name of spreading freedom. </span><u>There is only one force that can put an end to the successes of the state</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span><u>and that is an economically and morally informed public</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>Otherwise</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span><u>the state can continue to spread its malicious and destructive policies</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Demographers and economists have often battled to assert the demand-driven nature of much migration to suggest that it is much less of a threat than politicians suggest (Fischer and Straubhaar, 1996; Piore, 1989). Yet, clearly it is much harder to defuse the relevance of sending conditions on lower-end, poverty and conflict related migration. As a corollary, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">one might assume that higher-end migration much more perfectly fulfills market demand.</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Consequences follow from this assumption: that skilled migration is always “selected” by the receiving country; that it is governed by efficient not sub-optimal politics; and that such skilled workers are not replacing or suppressing the job opportunities of natives. If this view were true it would reflect migration at its Pareto efficient best, operating in a George Borjas-type neo-classical world (Borjas, 1989). The papers in this volume empirically challenge this neo-classical worldview in several respects. First and foremost, they show that</span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">, in the case of skilled no less than unskilled global migration, the macro-economic logic of market forces is mediated by <strong>institutional barriers and channeling mechanisms</strong>.</span></u> <strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">State policies regarding entry and exit</span></u></strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">, the granting or withholding of visas and work permits, and the establishment of numerical quotas on certain categories of migrant set the permissions and constraints under which various regimes of immigration are <strong>established</strong> by receiving nation-states</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">A good example</span></u></strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;"> is the <strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">complicated politics</span></strong> behind the number of skilled workers allowed H-1B visas, the principle legal channel of temporary labor migration in the US.</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> While the politics of low-skilled migration may be more visible and contentious, both </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">highly-skilled</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and unskilled migration </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">are shaped by distinctive policy processes and political structures.</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The papers by Gary Freeman and David Hill and by Jeannette Money and Dana Zartner Falstrom, in particular, offer useful analytical frameworks to differentiate between distinct forms of migration, often contradictory state policies, and their salient politics.</span><br />

The “brain gain” argument views the opportunity for skilled migration as an increase in the expected value of investment in education</u>. <u>If a college graduate can earn ﬁve ﬁgures</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">as a nurse in Dubuque or an engineer in Dubai, instead of four ﬁgures delivering mail in Manila, the thinking goes,</span> <u>more people will seek such degrees</u>. <u>That, in turn, will lead</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">social entrepreneurs and</span> <u>policy makers to build out an educational infrastructure to serve this demand. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Some of those who get an education as a result of the growth in this infrastructure do not migrate in the end, leaving the sending country better off than it would have been</span>. Beine, Docquier, and Rapoport (2008) conclude that countries that contain about <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">80 percent of the global population, mostly in large countries, are made better off by current levels of skilled migration as a result of this feedback effect.</span> Docquier (2006) argues that the optimal skilled migration rate is “positive in many cases.”</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">The “brain circulation” perspective asserts that the declining costs of transportation and communication allow people to capitalize on knowledge over much larger distances than ever before.</span> <u>Knowledge spillovers are much less localized than they used to be, thanks to more frequent personal visits and massive bandwidth. Members of a diaspora can more easily maintain strong relationships with the friends and colleagues that they left behind than they could in the past, and these social networks in their home countries capture some of the beneﬁts that would have been concentrated in the receiving country in the past.

<u>The establishment of a right of free expression ... constrains the decision-making process in the direction of free expression</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. 12 The political philosophy of democratic constitutionalism presupposes the belief that </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">the individual possesses certain inherent, inviolable rights against which the state may not transgress</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. 13 Under the social contract theory of the state, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">the preservation of rights essential to individual autonomy is a precondition to the surrender of sovereignty to the political majority.</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> 14 </span><u>These individual &quot;moral rights&quot; were brought into U.S. law through the adoption of a written Constitution</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, specifically in the Bill of Rights and the Reconstruction amendments. 15 </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Freedom of movement is one such moral right</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, a value deeply ingrained in Anglo-American history. 16 </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">This right finds its constitutional source in</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the normative values of </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">freedom of speech</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and conscience embodied in the First Amendment. 17 </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Freedom of movement, like freedom of speech, promotes the values of individual self-realization and self-determination</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. 18 </span><u>The right to <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">freedom of expression</span> also <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">has been grounded in</span> the normative principle of <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">self-government</span>.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> 19 John Stuart Mill, a firm advocate of the argument from individual autonomy, viewed free speech as essential to the quest for &quot;truth&quot; in public affairs. 20 Alexander Meiklejohn's theory of free speech emphasizes the place of the individual within the collective self-governing body, noting that &quot;the welfare of the community requires that those who decide issues shall understand them.&quot; 21 The dialogical theory of rights enlarges the self-government hypothesis, similarly stressing the role of individual speech and inquiry in the collective decisionmaking process. 22 </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">This approach builds on</span></u> <u>an underlying premise of <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">the First Amendment</span>: that expression has special value in the context of dialogue.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">23 The theory emphasizes the concept of free speech as enabling ra- [*109] tional decisionmaking, 24 and advances the principle of open discussion as key to the &quot;ability to entertain alternatives, to take a fresh point of view.&quot; 25 Paul Chevigny demonstrates that dialogue is a philosophical and psychological human need, 26 the absence of which renders it impossible for the individual and society to &quot;understand meanings and solve problems.&quot; 27 </span><u>The right to freedom of association is also inherent in the theory of dialogue rights.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> 28 Through this freedom, expression and inquiry are often realized or manifested, and dialogue is facilitated and enhanced. Finally, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">freedom of speech is a prerequisite to social and political change. Advocacy</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> - for change or for the status quo - </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">is one</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of the most </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">important function</span>s <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">of free speech</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in our society. 29 The historical context in which the expressive rights were championed and achieved - the struggle against the feudal monarchy - fully supports the protected position of the right to advocacy. 30 It is the premise of this Essay that </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">freedom of movement</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, as an aspect of freedom of expression, association, and inquiry, 31 </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">promotes</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the normative values of constitutional democracy: </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">individual autonomy and self-determination, self-realization, truth-seeking, understanding, problem-solving, self-government, and social change</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. This Essay also posits that the scientific and technological advances that have transformed modern society have altered fundamentally the social and cultural context in which speech is understood and defined. Today, &quot;any adequate conception of freedom of speech must ... draw upon several strands of theory in order to protect a rich variety of expressional modes.&quot; 32 Concurring in Aptheker v.

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">What can be done? </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">There clearly are alarming inroads on the right to freedom of expression in the world today</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The job of human rights organisations, with their long standing traditions of documenting such abuses, is to try to make it impossible for democratic governments throughout the world to ignore these abuses in their political, economic and cultural dealings with countries where violations take place. However, the essence of our work is documenting human rights violations with great thoroughness but usually after the event. There must now be a move towards more proactive work by these organisations and this necessarily means creating a community which can endorse fundamental rights and freedoms and insist that they are taken into account. In order to achieve this, one has first of all to create a network or community and this, I believe, is where professional associations such as the International Federation of Library Associations comes in. However, before looking in more detail at what professional organisations can do, we have to ask a question that must occupy us all: </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">why if the human rights community has grown</span></u> <u>so rapidly in the post World War II years and, at the same time, has become so professional <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">are there still</span> so many spectacular failures, such as the <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">atrocities in former Yugoslavia</span>, the <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">genocide in Rwanda</span>, the state of <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">terror in Algeria</span>, the increase in <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">religious brutality in</span> a wide swathe of countries, including <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Indonesia and Malaysia</span> to name but a few?</u> <u>Why is it that those erstwhile models of democracy, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Kenya and Nigeria, have deteriorated to</span> the point where the international community is no longer able to ignore the <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">violent suppression of democracy? Why</span> is it that there has been <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">an almost direct jump</span> from communism <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">in the former Soviet Union to extreme nationalism</span>, capitalism and free market philosophies which have all but eroded the basis for any form of democracy?</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> These are very clear failures on the part of the international human rights community which require some analysis. Of course, one can argue that without human rights pressure, the situations in many of these parts of the world might have been even worse than they are today. Certainly it must be the case that worldwide demand for civil and political rights helped to bring down communism in Central and Eastern Europe and bring about the death of apartheid in South Africa. But this is really not enough. Much debate is now taking place amongst various human rights organisations, including ARTICLE 19, and slowly some truths are beginning to emerge. One of these is that human rights is not an exclusive or elitist business carried out by the few for the good of the greater number. </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Human</span></u> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">rights, as a basis for democracy, is the responsibility of everyone</span> in the sense that <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">individuals and groups within society have to assume responsibility for monitoring government and its actions</span> and for insisting that the</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">government is accountable. ARTICLE 19's way of doing this is by attempting to be ever vigilant about the smallest infringements of freedom of expression in the belief that </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">great atrocities</span></u></strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;"> are built upon small, almost imperceptible, infringements of a seemingly benign kind</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">: The introduction of privacy laws in order to protect members of the government or even royalty which, in turn, once on the statute books can be used to prosecute journalists who may well be acting in the public interest. The passive acceptance that a given government is the appropriate body to decide on what constitutes obscenity which, in turn, may lead to laws which ban great literature. The introduction of a public order Act which is then used to forbid political demonstrations. </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">In every case where we see freedom of expression savagely undermined, these small beginnings are discernible with a very small amount of research</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. We are all very much wiser after the event. There is perhaps another reason for the failure to protect individual rights and that is that the concentration of human rights work has been in countries of the North for far too long. Although the work of such organisations has been absolutely invaluable in creating awareness amongst democratic governments and in standard setting, there must in future years be greater reliance on the strengthening of local organisations which are the only appropriate bodies to monitor their governments actions on a day to day basis. The rationale for this shift in emphasis lies in the fact that when a window of opportunity occurs in a country such as the ousting of a military dictatorship, democracy will not automatically fill the power vacuum that follows unless there has built up, over a period, of years a core of individuals and organisations who have a good and workable understanding of the steps needed to build the institutions of democracy at the local level. Ideally, human rights organisations existing in the North should become watchdogs for their own governments and a vehicle for amplifying the voices of those organisations which live and work in the South. IV. IFLA as a Force for Free Expression The question has been posed as to what kind of commitment should professional associations make and how they can, upon occasion, work with human rights organisations in order to ensure the freedoms for which they themselves stand. It is thus extremely fitting that </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">IFLA should be concerned with promoting and protecting freedom of expression and the free flow of information</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Its support, given that it is an international organisation working in national contexts, would be invaluable.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Few can remember a world without passports or borders. Yet that's how it was only 80 years ago. In Europe, you needed your passport only to go to Russia or Turkey. The freedom to travel was a part of Europe's liberal civilization. During the hundred years before World War I, most European economies enjoyed price stability&amp;emdash;thanks to the gold standard&amp;emdash;and an unprecedented growth in the standard of living. There were no major wars. Civil liberties and parliamentary institutions strengthened throughout Europe and seemed likely to spread over the whole world. Everyone believed that free migration promoted prosperity. Statesmen took for granted that the freedom to travel was part of the market economy. World War I brought an end to all that. By bringing ruin to the middle classes of Europe and wreaking havoc on the liberal institutions of the European nations, the war also put an end to the freedoms of travel and residence that had fueled the phenomenal expansion of commerce and industry. Tight controls on the movement of peoples appeared along with strict curbs on the international flow of capital. In a few short years of war, individual liberty of migration disappeared. The ideal of the <u>classical economists</u> was an open world economy with an international division of labor.</span> They <u>all acknowledged that <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">the free movement of labor was an indispensable counterpart to the unrestricted mobility of capital</span></u>. <u>Just as tariffs and quotas resulted only in dislocating the world market and decreasing economic welfare, so too immigration controls resulted in economic stagnation and the waste of human resources.</u> The classical economists also saw in the control of the free movement of peoples a remnant of the mercantilist system of political economy they opposed. <u>Under mercantilism, both physical and human capital were owned by the state.</u> They were national resources to be exploited in the pursuit of power. <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">Any curbs on the movement of peoples was a regression from liberal civilization and from individuals' freedom to make their own choices and live their own lives.</span></u> The suspicions of the liberal economists were confirmed during the inter-war years. Throughout the world, freedom of travel and freedom of enterprise disappeared simultaneously. <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">In Nazi Germany</span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">,</span> above all, <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">collectivist control of the economy meant the loss of individual freedom to travel and the forced migration of whole peoples and, in the end, policies of racial extermination</span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">.</span> By the outbreak of World War II, men and women, instead of being able to choose where they wanted to live and work, virtually had become the property of the state they happened to live in. What does the decline of freedom of movement and migration mean for the defense of the free market? In spite of the events of the past 60 years, conservatives have been slow to learn their lesson: <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">The freedoms that make the market economy cannot easily be divided.</span> Too often, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">those conservative free marketeers most firm in their opposition to intervention in the market by governments and labor unions have been in favor of the clumsy and inhumane control of migration.</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">In the U.S. and Europe, conservatives haven't followed the logic of the market economy in promoting free movement of peoples. On the contrary, they have given the defense of the free market a bad name. It is now considered a reactionary movement very different from the liberating force it was in the 19th century. Enoch Powell, Britain's most intellectually distinguished political defender of the market economy, is also the most prominent advocate of morally repellent and unworkable proposals for the repatriation of nonwhite immigrants. The Thatcher government in England firmly resisted the intemperate demands of the Tory right for even stricter immigration controls. But it seemed willing to abandon Hong Kong&amp;endash;that oasis of market capitalism&amp;endash;and stripped Hong Kong's hard-working citizens, who remain British subjects, of their right to reside in the United Kingdom. The Tories as a whole have displayed a strange blindness to cultural realities. They fail to see that in Britain today it is the Asian immigrant populations who are the last to hold the conservative virtues of hard work, business enterprise and family solidarity. It is surprising that with the entrepreneurial spirit in decline and the family in disarray in the native population in Britain, Tories have not seen in the million or so immigrant voters a natural ally in the political struggle against religious socialism. Now that conservatives are taking a more critical view of the overextended welfare state, it is a pity that they do not also look at their policies on immigration. It is the growth of the welfare state&amp;endash;and war&amp;endash;that has strengthened demands for immigration controls. Now that the British government is trying to return a large part of responsibility for welfare to individuals and families, it is a good time to reconsider immigration policy. A return to the pre-1914 world without frontiers is Utopian and a practical impossibility.</span> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">If the defense of capitalism is to have the humane and liberating aspect it had in the heyday of the free market,</span> however, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">and if conservatism is not to be a merely defensive and reactionary creed, it is high time attempts were made to relax and liberalize the controls on free movement.</span></u><br />

<u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Laws restricting the flow of immigration</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> have three characteristics that, in concert, flag these laws as prima facie rights violations. First, the laws </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">are coercive</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. That is, immigration restrictions are implemented through threats of physical force. Borders are patrolled by armed guards, and armed officers forcibly remove those who are discovered residing in the country illegally. Second, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">t</span></span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">he laws are highly restrictive</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. 3 That is, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">they significantly interfere with individuals’ ability to control their own destinies</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. They prevent individuals from living where they wish to live. </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">For</span> most of <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">those affected, the choice</span> that is thereby <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">closed off is an extremely important one, one with profound implications for the rest of those individuals’ lives</span>.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Few decisions are so important as the choice of what society to live in. In addition, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">i</span></span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">mmigration laws prevent those already living within the United States from interacting with would-be immigrants in ways that they would otherwise choose</span>— for instance, from employing the would-be immigrants</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, renting them apartments, or entering into other business and social relations. Third</span><u>, the laws are extremely harmful to most of the individuals who are thus restricted</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Few Americans would have any doubt that, </span><u>if someone were to force them to live in the Third World</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> for the rest of their lives, </span><u>whoever did this would thereby visit a great harm upon them</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>The harm to potential immigrants</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> from the Third World who are denied entry to the United States, or to illegal immigrants who are forcibly expelled</span><u>, is of the same kind and approximate magnitude</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. 4 </span><u>U.S. immigration policy forces millions to live in the Third World who could have better lives in America if only the American government were to step out of the way</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Also harmed are some of the families of potential immigrants, who might have received financial assistance from their relatives in America. There are two distinctions in ethical theory that might be used to cast doubt on my claim about the harmfulness of immigration restriction. First, some believe that there is an important distinction between doing and allowing, or between inflicting a harm on someone and merely allowing a harm to befall someone. Perhaps the harms suffered by the inhabitants of the Third World are harms that the U.S. government merely allows to occur, rather than harms that it inflicts. A second, related distinction is that between harming someone and merely failing to confer a benefit on someone. Perhaps the U.S. government merely fails to confer a benefit on potential immigrants—the benefit of citizenship—rather than actually harming them. Both of these suggestions fail. It is possible to harm someone not only by directly inflicting a harm, but also by actively preventing that person from taking actions to avert or remedy a harm. Suppose that, through no fault of mine, Marvin is in danger of starvation. He asks me for food. If I refuse to give him food, I thereby fail to confer a benefit on Marvin and, at the same time, allow Marvin to go hungry. If Marvin then starves to death, those who accept the doing/allowing distinction would say that I have not killed Marvin, but merely allowed him to die. And some believe that this is much less wrong than killing, possibly not even wrong at all. 5 But now consider a different case. Suppose that Marvin, again in danger of starvation, plans to walk to the local market to buy some food. In the absence of any outside interference, this plan would succeed—the market is open, and there are people willing to trade food for something that Marvin has. Now suppose that, knowing all this, I actively and forcibly restrain Marvin from reaching the market. As a result, he starves to death. In this situation, I would surely be said to have killed Marvin, or at least done something morally comparable to killing him. 6 The actions of the federal government of the United States are more analogous to the case in which I restrain Marvin from reaching the market, than to the case in which I merely decline to provide him with food. The government’s immigration policy is not a merely passive one—the government does not, for example, merely fail to assist people in coming to the United States. Rather, the government hires armed guards to stop people from coming in and to forcibly expel people who are already here. The federal government spends almost $13 billion a year on actively excluding or expelling unauthorized immigrants. 7 The United States is like the market where would-be immigrants could satisfy their needs. There are Americans willing to hire immigrants, to rent them living spaces, and in general to engage in all other kinds of needed interactions with immigrants. My charge is not that </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the U.S. government</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> fails to give Third World inhabitants what they need. It is that the government </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">actively and coercively prevents many</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Third World </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">inhabitants from taking a course of action that they otherwise would undertake and that would in fact succeed in enabling them to meet their needs</span>. This is much closer to inflicting a harm than it is to merely allowing a harm to occur.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> In some respects, of course, the government fails to confer benefits on those who are denied entry into the country. The U.S. government fails to grant them citizenship and fails to provide them with social services. But none of that is what I am flagging as indicative of a prima facie rights violation. The government’s exclusion of these individuals from the territory of the United States is a distinct action— conceivably, immigrants could be allowed to reside in the territory and trade with Americans, without being granted citizenship or the right to receive social services. The point is not that the state ought to adopt this policy, but simply that a denial of citizenship is distinct from a prohibition on occupying the territory. The former, perhaps, is a mere failure to confer a benefit. But the latter is a harm. Some might deny that the U.S. government harms would-be immigrants from the Third World, because the U.S. government is not the cause of the dire economic or political circumstances in which many of those individuals find themselves, the circumstances that prompt them to want to migrate in the first place. Granting that the U.S. government is not the primary cause of those circumstances, a case could be made that in some cases, the U.S. government has acted to exacerbate the problems. 8 But we may leave that issue aside here. Whether or not the government is a major cause of Third World inhabitants’ present situation, the government is responsible for their remaining in that situation, if the government actively and coercively prevents them from getting out of it. That is the lesson of the Marvin example above: we can stipulate that I was no part of the originating cause of Marvin’s present situation of being hungry and out of food. Perhaps Marvin suffered from crop failures on his farm, or perhaps someone else stole all his food. Whatever the origin of the problem may be, assume that I had nothing to do with it. Even so, if I prevent Marvin from getting more food, I then become responsible (perhaps in addition to other people who also wronged him) for his subsequent death by starvation, if Marvin would have been able to save himself in the absence of my interference. </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Legal restrictions on immigration, then, are harmful, coercive restrictions. Actions of this kind are</span> normally <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">rights violations</span>. No agent can simply presume an entitlement to act in such a way, without being able to identify the special circumstances rendering the harmful coercion justified.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">My claim at this point, again, is not that immigration restriction is wrong tout court, but that those defending the policy incur a burden of providing a special justification for harming potential immigrants. In light of the great seriousness of the restrictions and harms involved in this case, the justification for immigration restrictions must be correspondingly clear and powerful. Let us turn now to the grounds that have been offered by proponents of restriction.</span><br />

However, one may still insist, echoing Ernest Hemingway - &quot;I believe in only one thing: liberty.&quot; And it is always well to bear in mind David Hume's observation: <u>&quot;It is seldom that liberty of any kind is lost all at once</u>.&quot; Thus, <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">it is unacceptable to say</span> that the <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">invasion of</span> one aspect of <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">freedom is of no import because there have been invasions of</span> so many <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">other aspects.

<u>Because we in the United States tend to think of slavery as something relegated to the past, the numbers are as shocking as the nature of the crime - between 600,000 and <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">800,000 victims trafficked internationally</span>, with <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">tens of thousands trafficked into or within the U</span>nited <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">S</span>tates <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">every year</span>. n66 What is almost as disturbing is the <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">shockingly low numbers of victims </span>that <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">have been granted protection</span> in the more than three years since this broad anti-trafficking law went into effect</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Despite multi-million dollar programs, victim identification has been extremely slow, and </span><u>federal agencies have recognized [*392] that they are not finding victims at an &quot;acceptable rate.&quot;</u> <u>n67 There is a &quot;significant difference between the estimated number of people trafficked into the United States annually and the number of victims that the U.S. government has reached</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.&quot; n68 The nature of this crime - underground and often under-acknowledged - contributes to an inability to determine the precise number of people victimized by traffickers. Even different parts of the U.S. government do not agree on the number of victims granted benefits. n69 </span><u>Given the large number of victims, Congress estimated that 5000 temporary visas would be needed per year and placed an annual cap on T-visas at that number. n70 Similarly, the number of permanent residence grants based on trafficking victim status are capped at 5000 per year. n71 <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">The T-visa cap has not come close to being reached</span> in any of the three years reported so far</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. n72 </span><u>In fact, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">of the estimated tens of thousands of victims in the United States annually, only a few hundred have been identified and protected</span> since the TVPA became law.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> n73 By March 2005, fewer than 500 victim-witnesses had been granted temporary trafficking victim T visas since the law went into effect in 2000. n74 On March 23, 2005, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) Vermont Service Center, which adjudicates all T visa applications, reported [*393] that a total of 478 T-1 visas had been granted and 496 denied. n75 Additionally, by the end of fiscal year 2003, the ICE reported that a total of 374 victim-witnesses had been granted temporary &quot;continued presence&quot; status in order to assist law enforcement with trafficking prosecutions. n76 It is likely that many of those granted continued presence were the same victims later granted T-visa status; thus, the actual number of victims protected may be lower than the totals would suggest. In the same fiscal year, the Department of Justice reported that it had 153 ongoing human trafficking investigations, had filed 12 human trafficking cases under the TVPA, charged 31 defendants under the criminal provisions of the TVPA, and secured 26 convictions for human trafficking. n77 Furthermore, 151 trafficking victims were provided certification and benefit eligibility letters by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in fiscal year 2003. n78 As of March 2005, HHS reported a total of 651 letters of certification issued to human trafficking victims. n79 </span><u>Thus, over the course of four years, the law granted benefits to several hundred victims out of a pool of tens of thousands. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Something is not working</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Unfortunately, the government statistics do not provide enough detail to allow analysis of why there have been so few grants of benefits to trafficking victims. More precise information is needed about how the victims were identified, who identified them, how many identified victims were unable or unwilling to assist law enforcement, and how many of those victims were deported without receiving any assistance. Law enforcement agents who applied for legal status on behalf of a victim had more than one-fourth of their continued presence requests denied in 2003. n80 Similarly, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">many of the T-visa applications were denied. </span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">We do not know whether the applications were denied for inability to meet the immigration eligibility requirements or for other reasons. More detailed statistics will give a better understanding of the barriers to receiving victim benefits. </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">While each of these grants of benefits surely represents a life saved, there are thousands more that could be saved if the TVPA were</span> a <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">more effective</span> protection tool for victims. It is obvious that most of the tens of thousands of victims trafficked into the country each year are not found or protected by this law, despite the multi-million dollar anti-trafficking programs</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The government reports suggest several explanations for the large gaps between the numbers of estimated victims and those identified and protected: the law is new; law enforcement personnel and community groups need training to understand and recognize the existence of human trafficking; and prosecutions of this type are [*394] extremely complex and require tremendous resources. n81 </span><u>We would argue, however, that it is the law itself - <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the TVPA - which, despite its &quot;victim protection&quot; language, actually promulgated eligibility standards for benefits that not only burden victims, but also hamper law enforcemen</span>t. Although the TVPRA attempted to ameliorate the TVPA, it did not effectively address its main shortcomings.</u><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">DHS should eliminate the LEA endorsement restriction and locate the victim-identification function solely with trained DHS adjudicators. This would eliminate the uniformity challenge posed by the current system in which thousands of law enforcement agents and prosecutors serve as gatekeepers to the visa. A much smaller group of highly trained DHS adjudicators could respond more uniformly and rapidly to changes in trafficking patterns and new trafficker methods. 258 These adjudicators would also be advantageously positioned to decide victim eligibility divorced from any investigation or prosecution duties. </span><u>By <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">de-coupling victim status </span>determinations <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">from prosecutorial involvement</span>, the proposed model focuses on the credibility of victim narratives, not law enforcement assessments of victim suitability to serve as a witness. This de-coupling <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">would </span>also reduce the effect of the prosecutorial and investigative <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">focus on sex trafficking victims</span>,</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> as long as DHS adjudicators were trained to recognize victims of trafficking for both labor and sex. A centralized model based solely on victim demonstration of compliance with statutory standards is similar to that used to adjudicate petitions under the VAWA from non-citizen survivors of domestic violence. Domestic violence survivors typically submit evidence of abuse, including declarations, police reports, letters, and psychological evaluations. 259 Similarly, </span><u>T visa applicants should be able to demonstrate attempts at cooperation solely through their own evidence and narratives. 260 In cases where the DHS intends to deny a T visa application because of the paucity of corroborating evidence, it should first interview the T visa applicant and judge her credibility firsthand. 261 If, after this interview, the victim is judged not to be credible, then her T visa application can be denied</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>Although centralizing victim identification with DHS reduces prosecutorial control over T visas, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">it may actually result in additional victim participation in prosecutions. When the T visa is de-coupled from the LEA endorsement and prosecutorial approval, victims control the timing of their participation in any investigation. Additional time for reflection may result in more victim participation</span>.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">In Belgium and the Netherlands, as trafficking survivors begin to recover from their experience with the assistance of social service agencies, they are granted a reflection period in which to make an informed decision about cooperation. 262 During this period (forty-five days in Belgium and three months in the Netherlands), survivors are granted temporary immigration status. 263 In both countries, more victims report their traffickers now than did before there was a reflection period. 264 These results are consistent with psychological understandings of trauma survivors. </span><u>According to psychologist Judith Herman, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">trauma victims may actually be more stable witnesses if they are empowered to choose to participate in the investigation or prosecution of their persecutors</span>. 265 Once a victim’s life and psychological state have stabilized somewhat, she may be a more meaningful and directed participant in investigation or prosecution</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. An approach that relies solely on a victim’s own demonstration of compliance with the statute is consistent with encouraging survivor participation in the political struggle against human trafficking. </span><u>Thus far, this struggle has been defined by feminists and religious leaders opposed to sex work, prosecutors and law enforcement agents interested in convicting traffickers, and advocates seeking to protect victims’ rights in the current framework. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">The inclusion of survivor voices is crucial to re-examining and redefining the United States’ anti-trafficking efforts</span>.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> If a range of victims’ voices becomes part of the anti-trafficking debate, our conception of trafficking victims will surely expand to encompass a wide range of experiences from a diverse group of victims. </span><br />

<br />
<u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">An essential component of effective anti-trafficking legislation that addresses both the supply and demand factors for trafficking in persons is to define trafficked persons as &quot;victims.&quot;</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> n289 The Convention already does so. n290 </span><u>The Convention states that a &quot;'[v]ictim' shall mean any natural person who is subject to trafficking in human beings</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> as defined&quot; in the Convention. n291 However, </span><u>while the <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Protocol and the TVPA use the term &quot;victim,&quot; neither includes language defining who is a victim of trafficking</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. n292 </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">If legislation </span>or international agreements <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">do not define who constitutes a &quot;victim&quot; of trafficking it creates the danger that victims of trafficking in persons will </span>not <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">be </span>identified as victims, but rather <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">punished for being in the destination country illegally </span>or for violating the laws of the destination country by engaging in prostitution</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. n293 Dr. Mohammed Mattar, Executive Director of the Protection Project at Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies, observed that in the United States trafficking victims are simply not being identified. n294 In 2005, the [*713] United States had only identified 700 victims of trafficking n295 despite estimates by the government that 18,000-20,000 persons are trafficked into the United States each year. n296 For example, in 2008, a North Carolina &quot;[m]assage parlor [was] shut down after a three-month undercover investigation . . . . The owner of the [spa] . . . was charged with human trafficking and maintaining a place of prostitution. Employee Min Ye was charged with solicitation. Another employee, Dan Kim, was charged with two counts of indecent exposure.&quot; n297 Even though the owner was charged with human trafficking, those he had victimized were not treated as victims, but rather charged with the crimes of solicitation and indecent exposure. n298 </span><u>The market for human trafficking will not be shut down by charging the owner with human trafficking but failing to identify victims</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">like Min Ye and Dan Kim as true victims of trafficking. As discussed in Section I, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">to close down the market for human trafficking requires efforts to address both the demand and supply for victims.</span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-size: 8pt;"> n299 </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">In this case the trafficker was charged with human trafficking, thus increasing the cost of operation and deterring his future demand to utilized victims of trafficking in his business. n300 However, the victims were not identified as victims; rather they were treated as criminals and not provided rehabilitation services. Thus, </span><u>the supply of victims has not been decreased because their likelihood of being trafficked again for the purposes of sexual exploitation is increased</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. n301 As illustrated by this example, </span><u>the failure to identify victims of trafficking as victims leads to several consequences influencing both supply and demand for human trafficking</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. First, </span><u>if trafficked persons are not identified as victims, they may be precluded from accessing needed</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> medical </span><u>assistance</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, counseling, educational, financial, or other services provided to assist victims in the [*714] reintegration process. n302 </span><u>If victims are treated as criminals and not provided access to rehabilitation services, the probability that they will not successfully reintegrate into society is in-creased</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Thus, these non-identified victims will be more susceptible to being re-trafficked, increasing the supply of victims. n303 Furthermore, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">if victims are not identified as such it increases the probability that traffickers will not be charged with human trafficking</span>. This failure to increase the potential penalties for traffickers leads to no change in the cost of operation for traffickers, which in turn does make any impact on demand for victims</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. n304 For these reasons, </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the inclusion of the definition of a victim of human trafficking in national legislation and international agreements is essential to influencing both the supply and demand for trafficking victims</span></u></strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-size: 8pt;">.</span> <u>In addition to including a victim definition, it is necessary to educate law enforcement personnel, individuals providing rehabilitation services, and other persons who may come in contact with trafficking victims on the definition and the rights of victims under the law</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. A beneficial aspect of the agreements and legislation discussed above is their inclusion of provisions regarding educational efforts for these professionals. n305 Further, these agreements and legislation contain education and awareness campaigns targeted at informing potential victims of tactics used by traffickers and the dangers inherent in trafficking. n306 However, there is a need to increase the awareness of the general public in both countries of origin and destination, and of the consumers of sexual services in countries of destination, that trafficking is not a victimless crime. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Although the legislative history of the Act indicates concern for the victims of trafficking and recognizes that trafficking violates women's human rights, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the T visa </span><strong>is a limited option</strong>. It <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">limits the class of people who are eligible</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> n253 and places a numerical limit on the number of visas granted each year. n254 At most, 5000 people per year will be granted T visas. n255 In addition to providing relief for a limited number of trafficked persons<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">, </span></span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the Act <strong>focuses on crime-fighting</strong>, <strong>ignoring</strong> <strong>prevalent</strong> <strong>human rights issues</strong>.</span> A statement made by one of the Act's sponsors evidences the prioritization of the Act as a crime bill. &quot;The legislation further includes the creation of a new form of visa for trafficking victims. This will substantially allow for more aggressive prosecution, as well as the protection of these witness victims.&quot; n256 <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">The relief from deportation is <strong>inexorably linked</strong> to <strong>the crime-fighting mechanism</strong> of <strong>requiring cooperation and testimony</strong>. International human rights authorities</span> and non-governmental organizations <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">have <strong>expressed skepticism</strong> about a crime control approach <strong>adequately protecting the human rights of victims of trafficking</strong></span>.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary </span><u>Robinson</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span><u>wrote regarding the U.N.

<span class="StyleTimesNewRoman12ptBold">Responses to human trafficking are the <u>litmus test</u> of our credibility – only shifting to a human rights based approach solves </span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Since 1904, the international community has formalized its work to understand what human trafficking encompasses. Starting from a partial approach by addressing one victim-group (i.e. white women) and one type of labor exploitation (e.g. sex trafficking), the international community expanded its understanding of this issue and with this the ability to take action to reduce its scope. </span><u>Over the past one hundred years, the international community has slowly put together the pieces of the human trafficking puzzle. It has led <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">anti human trafficking efforts </span>since the abolition of institutional slavery and influenced national legislation in the U</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">nited </span><u>S</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">tates of America and the Federal Republic of Germany. After decades of slow evolution the international policy framework has progressed from a rough block of metal and emerged as a sharpened needle. The impetus of national efforts to define and stem human trafficking has drawn from the international community’s long-term efforts to build a comprehensive anti trafficking policy framework</span><u>. Yet this instrument is not perfect. This highly developed policy tool <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">should continue to be improved</span>. At the national level, government and societal <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">responses to human trafficking</span></strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;"> are <strong>a <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">litmus test </span>of the strength and quality of our democracies</strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. This analysis has shown that both the German and American Governments have made earnest efforts to address the problem of human trafficking by creating robust anti human trafficking policy frameworks. Both have learned from their engagement with this issue at the international level. Yet </span><u>in the national context, the sharpened <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">anti human trafficking </span>policy-needle <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">has been <strong>dulled</strong> <strong>by policy gaps and hidden agendas.</strong> Hence national human trafficking policies are subordinated </span>to competing and incompatible policy objectives that jeopardize the primary goal. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">These policy gaps and hidden agendas <strong>cast doubt</strong> on the <strong>commitment</strong> of both governments to <strong>stopping human trafficking and to doing so by means of a <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">human rights approach</span></strong></span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-size: 8pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The recommendations made in this analysis not only shed light on these hidden political agendas and gaps in policy in the United States of America and the Federal Republic of Germany, they also propose how to improve policy in both countries. </span><u>The suggested changes could <strong>increase the protection of human trafficking victims</strong>, improve information on the scope and nature of human trafficking, as well as <strong>enhance</strong> the ability of governments to prosecute perpetrators.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Both the German and the US Governments could profit from a closer comparison and exchange of their anti human trafficking policies and initiatives. This analysis could in turn act as a springboard for increased exchange and learning. Combating human trafficking is not an isolated policy niche that concerns only a few select experts. </span><u>Although the immediate consequences of human trafficking are felt most intensely by the victims of the crime, it is nonetheless an issue that concerns the whole of society.</u><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Fourth and finally, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">we need to support</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, not attack </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the institutions and tools of international law</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.

We need to support the International Criminal Court, and to endorse universal standards by ratifying such human rights treaties as the Convention on Disability Rights, the Convention Against Forced Disappearances, the UN Treaty for Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Right now, amazingly, we are one of only two countries in the world that is not a party to the Children's Rights treaty. The other is Somalia, whose excuse is that they have no organized government. We have no excuse.

And believe me, this should not be a partisan point: One presidential candidate recently wrote: &quot;We Americans recall the words of our founders in the declaration of independence, that </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">we must pay</span> &quot;</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">decent </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">respect to the opinions of mankind</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot;. .<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">. </span></span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">We all have to live up to our own high standards of morality and international responsibility</span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-size: 8pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> We cannot torture or treat inhumanely the suspected terrorists that we have captured. We will fight the terrorists and at the same time defend the rights that are the foundations of our society.&quot; The speaker was John McCain, but the same views have been expressed just as strongly by Senator Obama, who said: &quot;We are going to lead by example, by maintaining the highest standards of civil liberties and human rights, which is why I will close Guantanamo and restore habeas corpus and say no to torture. ... Because if you are ready for change, then you can elect a president who has taught the Constitution, and believes in the Constitution, and will obey the Constitution of the USA.&quot; Obviously, </span><u>we must ask our government officials to speak up for these steps-to tell the truth</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span><u>to end double standards, to put our own house in order, and to support law and institutions</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. But the truth is, whatever Administration is elected next year, its leaders will have their own reasons why they cannot change course immediately. </span><br />

Policies to combat trafficking have also been followed a top-down pattern, where international organizations rely on a combination of incentives and sanctions to pressure governments toconform to common legal standards and policy procedures</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. An expanding network of local nongovernmental, state, and transnational actors are directly involved in every stage of the policy making process. Like in the case of corruption, we can also observe efforts to better measure the scope of trafficking, as well as governments’ compliance with anti-trafficking policies. </span><u>While global anti-trafficking policies interact with different domestic conditions, to date <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">anti-trafficking policy in the Balkans</span>, like anticorruption policies, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">has appeared to follow a one-size-fits-all pattern</span>. Anti-trafficking policy,</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> like anti-corruption, </span><u>exemplifies a “transnational” policy by Orenstein’s definition, one that is “developed, diffused, and implemented with the direct involvement of global policy actors and coalitions at or across the international, national, or local levels of governance.” 3 <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">In the case of anti-trafficking in the Balkans, transnational policy actors have not only been involved directly in all stages of the policy process; one could argue that anti-trafficking policy would not exist without the involvement of transnational actors</span>.

<u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Law enforcement strategies have become a central focus of anti-trafficking strategies</span>. Efforts to prevent, suppress and prosecute traffickers have resulted in increased trans-border cooperation among law enforcement agencies as well as high-profile operations such as Mirage</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The law enforcement approach has resulted in numerous traffickers being apprehended, convicted and prosecuted. Yet </span><u>critics argue that <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the law enforcement approach has failed to significantly reduce the trade, with traffickers demonstrating great flexibility and ingenuity in eluding police by quickly changing transportation and distribution routes or moving the trade further underground</span>. Critics also argue that the law enforcement approach has also resulted in a re-victimization of trafficked persons.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> For one, they suggest that operations like Mirage result in more women being apprehended and charged on illegal migration or prostitution charges than identifying and assisting trafficked women and their traffickers. Moreover, aggressive policing has the unintended consequence of moving much of the prostitution trade to private apartments, often on the outskirts of cities and towns, where women are further isolated and vulnerable to violent abuse. 39 HelgaKonrad, Chair of the Stability Pact Task Force on Trafficking in Human Beings, referring to the declining RCP numbers, states: The [RCP] figures show that </span><u>the trafficking in human beings is going underground. It shows that the traffickers rapidly react to our responses in the fight against human trafficking</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. And it shows that the victims are no longer found in bars and brothels. Brothel raids caused traffickers to shift the victims to private locations where, of course, access is more difficult and where it becomes more difficult to provide assistance. 40 Finally</span><u>, because the law enforcement approach rests on convicting and prosecuting individual traffickers (a condition of the UN Protocol) prosecutors must rely largely on the willingness of victims to testify against their traffickers. 41 <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Since designated “victims of trafficking” are granted immunity from illegal migration or prostitution charges, refusing to testify can make them more vulnerable to threats of immediate deportation or prosecution</span>. Moreover, as victim assistance programs, including emergency and short-term shelters, are being increasingly being managed and funded by state agencies, assistance can be made conditional on the women cooperating with the prosecution.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> If a person does agree to testify governments are legally required to provide witness protection. Yet in many cases the very same government and law enforcement agencies tasked with providing this protection have themselves been implicated with being involved in the trafficking trade. In sum, </span><u>critics of the law enforcement approach argue that when the principal concern of this approach is to stop criminals, the interests of their victims become of secondary concern, often leading to their further exploitation</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> C. Re-trafficking as a failure of migration and law enforcement approaches </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Re-trafficking has been identified as an increasingly prevalent problem</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The 2005 RCP report documents that anywhere from three percent to 50 percent of women repatriated from destination countries to their home countries from 2003 to 2005 were re-trafficked within a year. The IOM attributes the high rates of re-trafficking to the predatory strategies of recruiters, who target highly vulnerable repatriated persons. Recruiters, unlike traffickers, are often embedded in particular cities and towns and thus less vulnerable to being apprehended at border crossings or brothel raids. Yet the IOM also acknowledges serious gaps in the repatriation and reintegration process, where women are returned home to face poverty, shame, and often abuse without adequate social support. 42 IOM’s critics, however, argue that the high rates of re-trafficking raise fundamental questions about the long-term effectiveness of its migration approach to anti-trafficking that makes repatriation and preventing illegal migration its central aim. Local and transnational networks of NGOs have taken the lead in addressing the re-trafficking issue, creating assistance and referral networks that track women being repatriated to their home countries. While informal monitoring and referral networks can provide some short-term assistance to repatriated women, advocates of an economic approach to anti-trafficking argue that the ongoing cycle of trafficking illuminates the underlying structural or economic nature of the problem. As the EU fortifies its borders against the migrant and crime exporting states to its south and east, and funds increased law enforcement initiatives in its bordering regions like the Balkans, traffickers continue to profit on the limitless supply of the unemployed and dislocated persons who become trapped in the trafficking cycle. Concluding remarks </span><u>We can draw several conclusions from this analysis. First, anti-trafficking policy has become an “obsession” of the international community, with a wide range of transnational actors coordinating efforts to develop, diffuse and implement anti-trafficking policy. Yet differences exist in how transnational actors frame the nature of the trafficking problem, pointing to the need to investigate points of conflict as well as “consensus” in emerging transnational policy areas. Whether trafficking is portrayed as a migration, law enforcement, human rights or economic problem shapes the kind of policy strategies created to address the issue.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Second, what frame prevails over another depends, in part, on the positional advantages and material resources of its main proponents. As the two most powerful actors in the region, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the United States</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">and the European Union </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">exert disproportionate influence in promoting a more migration and law enforcement approach to anti-trafficking efforts</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Finally, </span><u>some unintended consequences of implementing anti-trafficking policies to date may be leading to undermining theauthority and legitimacy of the prevailing policy paradigms. Migration and law enforcement approaches can have the unintended effect of exacerbating the vulnerability and exploitation of trafficked persons. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">To create more effective transnational anti-trafficking policies we might consider the following <strong>shift in focus</strong></span>.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> For one, including a wide range of relevant actors can make transnational anti-trafficking policy less top-down. For instance, creating mechanisms in which trafficked persons can be given a direct voice in policy-making can help overcome potential conflicts of interest when service providers, whether local NGOs, governments, or transnational actors, have incentives to interpret their first hand accounts to further a particular agenda. This could assist in resolving disputes between the IOM, which claims that declining shelter numbers can be attributed to law enforcement policies, and their critics who argue the IOM’s migration approach is to blame. Second, </span><u>the increasing awareness of re-trafficking highlights the limitations of policing, whether of borders or sex work, and turns our attention towards the underlying economic and social causes of trafficking<strong>. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Easing strict visa regimes or granting extended </span></strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">or even permanent <strong>resident status</strong> to <strong>trafficked persons</strong> are two immediate solutions </span>to reduce retrafficking.</u><br />

The Obama team is anyway looking ahead to the “more important” Strategic and Economic Dialogue that is scheduled to take place in Beijing later this month. The </span><u>U.S.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and other Western democracies </span><u>have</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> long </span><u>struggled</u> <u>with</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the challenge of </span><u>finding</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> a </span><u>meaningful</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and effective </span><u>means</u> <u>of engaging China</u> <u>on</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> issues of </span><u>h</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">uman </span><u>r</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">ights and political </span><u>reform</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. As China has become more powerful and influential on the world stage, its illiberal policies at home and abroad have created new challenges for human rights advocates on a global scale. While there has long been a segment of the China policy community that dismissed or minimized concerns about China’s human rights record, </span><u>even some long-time activists became discouraged in recent years by Beijing’s seeming imperviousness to</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> international and domestic </span><u>h</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">uman </span><u>r</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">ights </span><u>critiques</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, as well as the steady diminution of protests from Western democracies.

In addition, over the past three decades, as global perceptions of China became more positive and relations between China and democratic countries evolved, criticism of China’s human rights practices has receded in both importance and volume relative to other countries’ overall discourse on China. China and other leading countries now engage each other in a radical different fashion than they did 10 years ago. There have been several landmark events and particular dynamics that have fundamentally altered the landscape. For American activists and advocacy organizations, the establishment of permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) with China marked a critical turning point. Prior to PNTR, the annual debate on renewal of China’s Most Favored Nation (MFN) trading status in the United States Congress provided a unique annual opportunity to discuss China’s human rights record. Because there had to be a vote on MFN every year, there was a guaranteed public, meaningful, high-level, inter-branch policy debate about the nature of the Chinese regime and U.S. response to it. Efforts to develop alternative venues for continuing meaningful debate about human rights in China largely fizzled after the passage of PNTR, and advocates of human rights in China have never recovered from the loss of this important forum. </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">The deterioration of</span></u> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">U</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">nited </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">N</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">ations </span><u>h</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">uman </span><u>r</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">ights </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">mechanisms</span></u> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">and abdication of leadership on</span></u> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">h</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">uman </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">r</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">ights </span><u>issues <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">by the UN has further</span></u> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">weakened</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">international </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">efforts to support</span></u> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">h</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">uman </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">r</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">ights </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">in China</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>After China easily turned back several UN</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Human Rights Commission </span><u>resolutions</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> condemning its human rights practices, </span><u>Western governments stopped pursuing such resolutions altogether</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The Commission’s successor organization, </span><u>the</u> <u>UN</u> <u>H</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">uman </span><u>R</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">ights </span><u>C</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">ouncil, </span><u>has proven</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> even more </span><u>feckless</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – an intentional feature as a result of heavy Chinese involvement in its design. China has also engaged in a sustained and successful effort to block non-government organizations’ (NGO) advocacy efforts at various UN forums, using the UN NGO credentialing system to restrict critics’ access to meetings, treaty bodies and committees. Western governments have done little to fight back. As the utility of UN mechanisms collapsed, many Western countries pinned their hopes on engagement with China through bilateral human rights dialogues of the sort taking place this week. These dialogues initially proliferated between Western governments and the PRC. Some advocacy groups and NGOs found them to be useful forums for both pushing their own governments to focus on China’s poor human rights practices and, in some cases, a venue for direct contact with Chinese officials who would otherwise never directly encounter Western human rights campaigners. At a time when there were few other bilateral dialogues with China, the human rights channel was a major feature of Western democracies’ interactions with the Chinese government. After initially scoring some successes, such as political prisoner releases and changes to </span><u>PRC</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> laws criminalizing certain political behavior, however, these </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">dialogues</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">increasingly </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">became empty bureaucratic exercises</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>The cramped agendas</u> <u>proceed</u> <u>on the basis of the “equality” of the</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> human rights </span><u>practices of the two</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">sides, </span><u>and with</u> <u>an</u> <u>out-sized focus on legalistic issues</u> <u>where China could claim substantial gains</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and sharpen its critiques of its dialogue partner. Dialogues with European countries increasingly focused on their “technical assistance” programs, and some of the most useful dialogues with formerly communist Eastern European countries were shut down altogether. </span><u>China</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> successfully </span><u>pressured</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> dialogue </span><u>partners</u> <u>to exclude critical NGO voices</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> that had previously participated in talks, and certainly never engaged its own growing grassroots NGO sector in the dialogue process. As a result, the dialogues were transformed into heavily scripted government-to-government exchanges that relegate human rights issues to a bilateral backwater. Several</span> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">recent events</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span><u>however</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">have demonstrated the serious dangers posed by a China that achieves economic preeminence and military parity with the developed West </span>while resisting political liberalization at home</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">and exposed the need for a renewal of international</span></u> <u>h</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">uman </span><u>r</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">ights </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">strategies on China</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>As a result</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">there is growing interest</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">among advocates—and new potential partners outside the human rights community—</span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">in identifying and employing a more effective approach</span> to</u> <u>h</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">uman </span><u>r</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">ights </span><u>in China</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>This opening</u> <u>has</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, in a real sense, </span><u>been created by China’s increasing intransigence and belligerence on the world stage</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span><u>and the Chinese authorities’ severe retrenchment on h</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">uman </span><u>r</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">ights issues at home. The long-time mantra of the human rights community – that </span><u>the authoritarian nature of China’s regime has consequences beyond the fate of a few dissidents and Tibetans</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – is starting to resonate. The convergence of these forces can be seen most vividly in the Google spying and censorship case. </span><u>Google’s announcement that it would no longer censor its search engine</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> results in China as required by the government, </span><u>and its concurrent</u> <u>charge</u> <u>that</u> <u>Chinese hackers had penetrated its secure servers</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, both </span><u>to steal</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> proprietary code </span><u>and to snoop</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> into human rights activists’ private email accounts, </span><u>was a perfect illustration of how China’s</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> illiberal government </span><u>policies</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and practices </span><u>impact those hoping to do business under this regime</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. More broadly, </span><u>recent</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> opinion </span><u>polls</u> <u>have shown increasing dissatisfaction with Chinese economic policies</u> <u>among multi-national corporations</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and China’s approval ratings dropping in other countries. </span><u>The willingness of some businesses to go public with their concerns and even explicitly link the harm their business suffers to China’s political model is a sea change from the past. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">The challenge for the</span></u> <u>h</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">uman </span><u>r</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">ights </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">community</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">now </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">is to take maximum advantage of this</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">potential </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">opening to rebuild a more durable</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, effective </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">coalition </span>in support of</u> <u>h</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">uman </span><u>r</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">ights </span><u>in China.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> They should do this through vigorous outreach to groups outside the traditional human rights community who are increasingly attuned to the downside of Chinese autarky: the business community, security analysts, internet freedom advocates, faith communities, environmental activists, and especially local and regional activists in Asia. Once the coalition has been expanded, it needs to be more strategic and targeted in its approach. This means developing strategies that play to the strengths of a loose-knit, diverse group working across open societies, and similarly exploits the weaknesses of China’s brittle, top-down authoritarian structure and political culture. There also needs to be a considered effort to find ways of supporting the most vulnerable activists working for change inside China. </span><br />

In recognition of that fact, the Center for American Progress released a comprehensive report in August 2008, entitled “A Global Imperative: A Progressive Approach to U.S.-China Relations in the 21st Century,” that addressed all aspects of U.S.-China relations. Building upon that report, “Strategic Persistence: How the United States Can Help Improve Human Rights in China” is designed to provide both fundamental principles that should guide U.S. policymakers in their efforts to effect positive change in China’s human rights practices and concrete recommendations to advance those efforts. </span><u>Despite</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> significant </span><u>progress</u> <u>in realizing</u> <u>social and economic rights</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and even some increases in individual freedoms, </span><u>China remains responsible for profound violations of its people’s civil and political rights</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.

China is a major power and the United States has a multiplicity of interests in relation to it. Human rights policy must take those facts into account. Develop separate strategies for democracy promotion and human rights. The two are related, but they are not identical. Each deserves its own carefully designed approach. Opt preferentially for carrots over sticks. The United States’ capacity to “punish” China is limited and generally ineffective. The United States should not hesitate to criticize China as appropriate, but our preference should be for reinforcing positive changes. Understanding is not condoning. China faces an array of profound challenges. The United States should acknowledge them in order to know better how to influence the Chinese government. Appeal to China’s interests and connect the dots. Human rights are in China’s own best interests, but the Chinese government rarely perceives that to be the case and often misjudges how others will respond to its actions. </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Wherever possible, the</span></u> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">U</span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-size: 8pt;">nited </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">S</span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-size: 8pt;">tates </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">should base its appeals on China’s own needs</span>.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Globalize the pressure and encourage China to play by the world’s rules.

In 2006 the UN Commission on Human Rights was replaced with the UN Human Rights Council, which reports directly to the General Assembly. </span><u>The</u> <u>U</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">nited </span><u>S</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">tates </span><u>has maintained an arms-length distance from the new Council</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, primarily because of its negative focus on Israel and relative neglect of such countries as Burma and Cuba. However, the UN also fields a number of Special Rapporteurs to some countries with problematic rights records, one of which is Burma. At this juncture, </span><u>the better prospects</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> for multilateral cooperation on rights </span><u>may be those that include, rather than target, China</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and focus on countries where rights abuses are of epic proportions. </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Building on the view of China as a “global stakeholder,” the new administration should seek to draw China more closely into efforts to address ongoing gross</span></u> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">h</span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-size: 8pt;">uman </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">r</span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-size: 8pt;">ights </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">abuse</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">in the Sudan, as well as to seek new approaches – from China and other Asian powers – that might help move the Burmese regime off its longstanding political intransigence. If the Six-Party process on North Korea proves to be effective, a multilateral approach to promoting human rights in North Korea may also be appropriate. This is probably a distant goal: Pyongyang is not likely to realize the same political benefits in a rights framework that it does in a non-proliferation process and could well resist. However, if and when human rights in North Korea becomes a multilateral issue, China will again be a critical player. Human rights advocacy resists relativism and some will oppose the idea of putting greater effort into gaining Chinese cooperation on problems in other countries than in pointing out human rights abuses within China. However, this should not be confused with more traditional tradeoffs, in which human rights concerns are sometimes downplayed for the sake of security or economic policy. </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">This approach</span></u> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">is</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">itself </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">grounded in</span></u> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">h</span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-size: 8pt;">uman </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">r</span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-size: 8pt;">ights, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">with the</span></u> <u>possible</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (but not guaranteed) long-term </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">outcome that cooperating</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">with the international community </span><u>on rights</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> initiatives </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">could have a positive spillover effect on the Chinese domestic environment</span>.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">An informal international coalition on Burma policy has developed in recent years. It includes the United States, European Union, Japan, China, ASEAN and India, although New Delhi is uncomfortable with pushing Burma if it undermines India’s new “Look East” policy in Southeast Asia. The new administration will have the opportunity to fill the new position of U.S. Special Representative and Policy Coordinator for Burma, which will hold the rank of Ambassador, and it should do so at an early opportunity. However, this new position should be a gate which swings both ways, in which the Special Representative not only pursues U.S. policy interests vigorously but also educates the U.S. policy community on the views of the coalition partners. There is a growing consensus among Asian governments that the West’s policy on Burma is morally correct but outdated and ineffective. If the United States automatically rejects ideas for new avenues to promote greater freedom in Burma from this coalition, it will lose credibility in Asia as an international partner. Lastly, the new administration should take up new opportunities to encourage Asian regional institutions to develop human rights frameworks and dialogues. The new ASEAN Charter includes a commitment for ASEAN to establish a human rights body, although its responsibilities are not specified. Washington should take care not to let the perfect be the enemy of the good in this case, and should support any movement toward a credible regional human rights framework, however incremental. The newly-established position of U.S. Ambassador for ASEAN Affairs should make the United States more acceptable as an interlocutor on this issue. Signing the ASEAN Treaty of Amity and Cooperation early in the new administration would strengthen U.S. bona fides further. The United States should also consider ways to support the new Bali Democratic Forum, founded by Indonesia in concert with Australia, which seeks to promote political liberalization in the region but does not take the ideological approach of excluding countries that do not meet the criteria of a formal democracy. </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">A more open-minded</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">and multilateral </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">approach </span>to</u> <u>h</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">uman </span><u>r</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">ights in Asia early in the new administration </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">will</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">help to </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">counter the negative image of the</span></u> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">U</span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-size: 8pt;">nited </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">S</span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-size: 8pt;">tates</span> <u>that has arisen</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in recent years </span><u>in</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> some </span><u>Asian quarters</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – particularly in Muslim Southeast Asia – </span><u>of a tone-deaf, unilateralist superpower</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>Beyond the potential gains for</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> U.S. “</span><u>soft power</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">,” </span><u>a more multilateral approach may</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> also </span><u>yield dividends in the promotion of rights,</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> both </span><u>in Asia and on a</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">more</span> <u>global scale</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. However, this should be a shift in emphasis rather than a complete renunciation of all other policy approaches.

<span style="font-size: 6pt;">The world goes on its merry way and fossil fuel use continues to power it.

The trafficking definition in the Trafficking Protocol discussed earlier lists several means of exploitation such as abuse of power and use of a persons' vulnerability that at a minimum, constitute human trafficking</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. n195 </span><u>The inclusion of the phrase, &quot;at a minimum,&quot; suggests there are unenumerated means and forms of trafficking that should not go unpunished and that Signatories should simply utilize the framework as a starting point in delineating a definition</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Human Rights Watch, an international human rights organization, defines the crime of trafficking more comprehensively than the Trafficking Protocol. It defines human trafficking to include all acts and attempted acts related to the recruitment, transport, transfer, sale or purchase of human beings for the purpose of placing them into conditions of servitude, including forced marriage, in which labor is extracted through physical and/or nonphysical means of coercion including debt bondage, blackmail, fraud, deceit, isolation, threat or use of physical force and psychological pressure. n196 </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">The U.S. definition is <strong>not nearly this broad</strong>, and as a result, regrettably, <strong>women are left <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">unprotected</span></strong>. </span>One reason for this is that <strong>the purpose</strong> behind the U.S. definition is <strong>not solely motivated by rights-protection</strong>. n197 The U.S. government's purpose is <strong>in part to limit services</strong>, including immigration relief, so as to minimize [*217] potential exploitation of immigration relief by victims</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. n198 </span><u>The U.S. definition of &quot;severe forms of trafficking&quot; requires an element of force, fraud or coercion. n199 One can imply in the definition of coercion that non-physical threats or psychological pressure are included, but they are not explicitly enumerated. n200 <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Furthermore, <strong>having the word severe qualify &quot;forms of trafficking&quot; implies that there is a lesser kind of human trafficking that is permissible</strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Finally, there are no provisions in the TVPA that establish how the determination is to be made regarding who falls within the ambit of statutory protections, making the definition almost impossible for law enforcement officials and agents to deconstruct and apply effectively and uniformly. n201 In sum</span><u>, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the United States' definition of human trafficking is <strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">inconsistent</span></strong> with its <strong>declared purpose of protecting human trafficking victims</strong>.

In addition, the definition should contain an all-inclusive phrase that incorporates &quot;all other forms of exploitation that violate the rights of citizens as protected by the state.&quot; n202 This way, if a prosecutor is confronted with a form of exploitation that is not explicitly delineated in law, there is a catch-all phrase in the law itself to assist in upholding a trafficking charge instead of having to depend on another crime, which would perhaps mandate a lower sentence. Moreover, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">an expanded definition would ensure that all human trafficking victims, regardless of the method utilized, benefit from desperately needed protection, social services and immigration relief</span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />

Trafficking may occur across borders or within a nation, and may not involve any movement at all, as long as it involves holding a victim against their will - usually through the use of force, fraud, or coercion. </span><u>n14 Most often the <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">victims</span>, lured by promises of employment, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">are held against their will</span>, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">and through the use of force or threats, are sexually exploited or put to forced labor</span>. n15 The compelled labor may involve prostitution, field labor, work in sweatshops or garment [*854] factories, exotic dancing, and street peddling. n16 <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">The victims are deprived of all of their rights</span>, including their opportunity to leave and return home</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. n17 One of the most egregious cases of trafficking and forced prostitution took place in Florida in 1997. n18 Leading the prostitution ring was the Cardenas-Sosa family - a close-knit extended family from Mexico who preyed on young Mexican girls and women, smuggling them across the border and into one of six brothels, where they were forced to have sex with migrant workers. n19 The women were lured by promises of work in the United States as waitresses, landscapers and nannies. n20 They were held by the Cadenas under threats that their families would be killed, and they were beaten, raped, or confined in the dark at gunpoint for several days if they resisted in any way. n21 They worked six days a week, twelve hours a day, servicing as many as thirty-five clients in one shift. n22 The ringleader and six other men were eventually caught, convicted, and sentenced to up to a mere fifteen years of incarceration. n23 Many others involved in the trafficking ring escaped safely to Mexico without prosecution. n24 This is clearly an unsatisfactory ending to such a terrible story; however, the case is ongoing and the Department of Justice (DOJ) has reported that several other Cardenas family members have been found in Mexico and eventually prosecuted. </span><u>n25 Not all victims of trafficking are forced to work as prostitutes or in other forms of sexual exploitation. n26 Many victims are brought to the United States in the same manner as described above, but instead are forced to perform hard labor for little or no compensation.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> n27 In a [*855] more recent New York case, United States v. Sabhani, et al., two defendants held their victims as slaves in their luxurious home in Long Island. n28 The victims were forced to sleep on mats on the floor, barely fed, threatened with violence, and were frequently beaten. n29 The couple was eventually convicted of forced labor and harboring illegal aliens for keeping the two Indonesian women in their home. n30 There is, however, no mention of the length of the sentence that they received. n31 </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Trafficking <strong>is indeed a &quot; &quot;form of modern day slavery'</strong></span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">and has become&quot; more profitable as a result of globalization, which has increased the ease of moving goods and services in the international market. n32 </span><u>Although state sanctioned slavery no longer exists, the demand for cheap labor and prostitutes continues.

<u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">To be truly justified, a net utilitarian calculation is insufficient; the actor</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, instead, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">must be able to show that she had chosen the least possible harmful mean that could avert the greater evil, without jeopardizing the success of the</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> military </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">mission. This further condition is intended to supplement the causal connection between the violation and the aversion of harm and to ensure that the lesser evil justification is not used to mask unnecessary atrocities.</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The domestic necessity defense does not require this condition; instead, it offers only a vague proportionality test. The joint necessity-duress clause in the ICC Rome Statute includes a similarly broader test, namely that “the person acts necessarily and reasonably to avoid this threat.” Both the domestic necessity and the ICC necessity operate only when the defendant has acted against an imminent threat. But where a government chooses in an non-imminent, premeditated decision to break the law, it supposedly can and should assess the full ramifications of the violation, including by considering less harmful means, whether legal or illegal themselves. In the Early Warning case, the High Court of Justice addressed the possible use of loudspeakers as an alternative to the reliance on civilians. The IDF’s position, to recall, was that the use of loudspeakers would call attention to the forces operating, thereby increasing the risk of all-round escalation. It is unclear to what extent this alternative affected the final decision of the judges, and whether the Court ultimately struck down the procedure despite deferring to the IDF’s judgment on this particular issue. The use of torture, so it is commonly agreed by those who are willing to accept it as necessary under certain circumstances, must be restricted to those cases where a similar outcome could not be achieved by any other means. Consequently, if any less harmful measure (for instance, detention, the taking of hostages, or even the threat of using torture) would have had a similar probability of success, torture would be unjustifiable. This requirement would also exclude certain atrocities from consideration under the humanitarian necessity paradigm altogether. Consider, for instance, the crime of rape: It is impossible to imagine any scenario in which the raping of an individual would be the least harmful way to achieve a certain goal. If anything less than killing is possible, there must be a range of less harmful means to avert the harm the infliction of which is allowed under the law. </span><u>The less harmful means requirement casts the largest shadow over the attacks on Hiroshima, and particularly, Nagasaki. Was it indeed impossible to avert Operation Downfall by using less disastrous means?</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Or were some scientists, who argued that inviting UN representatives for a live demonstration of the explosion in the desert, correct in arguing that this option had to be tried out first, before dropping the bomb on densely populated cities? Does the insistence of the Emperor on conditional surrender even after the widespread firebombing of Tokyo and the invasion of Okinawa prove that there were no other options? </span><u>Did the conditions set by the Emperor warrant the continuation of the war? Could the use of nuclear weapons ever be justified under the “least harmful requirement” condition?</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">8) Burden and Standard of Proof </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">Operating as a justification</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, rather than a source of obligation, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">the burden of proof of the various elements of the necessity justification should be placed on the actor seeking to invoke it</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.194 This is the requirement of the ICC Rome Statute as well, with regard to all claims for excluding culpability. </span><u>This <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">allocation of responsibility should guard not only against disingenuous claims, but would also place the problem of uncertainty on the shoulders of the actor.</span></u> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">In case of doubt, the rule should be upheld against the justification.</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">A more complicated question is the standard of proof. If we condition the justification upon a post-facto determination of lesser-evil, this determination would be subject to an empirical test. The same empirical test should be applied to the determination of ex-ante good intentions. The determination of a causal connection and even more so, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">the weighing of less harmful alternatives</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, in contrast, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">would be impossible to put to a concrete empirical test.</span></u> <u>Instead, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">both would have to rely on the weighing of probabilities and be put to a test of reasonableness</span>.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> In case of doubt, the rule should be upheld against the justification. </span><br />

<span class="StyleTimesNewRoman12ptBold">Subjecting individual liberty to risk assessment rips you of your connection to the world, making extinction inevitable. </span><br />
<span class="StyleTimesNewRoman12ptBold">O’Brien, 2000</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> [Mary, Ph. D, environmental scientist and activist, “Making Better Environmental Decisions,” Pg-xvii-xviii] </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">This book is based on the understanding that </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">it is not acceptable for people to tell you that the harms to which they will subject you and the world are safe</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">or insignificant. You deserve to know good alternative to those harms, and you deserve to help decide which alternative will be chosen. Underlying this book, however, is a less explicitly stated personal belief, namely that </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">we</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> humans </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">will never dredge up enough will to alter our</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> habitual, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">destructive ways of behaving toward each other and the world unless we</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> simultaneously </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">employ information <em>and</em></span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">emotion <em>and</em> </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">a sense of relationship to others</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">—other species, other cultures, and other generations. Using this information while divorced from emotion and </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">using information while insulated from connection to a wide net of others are how destruction of the Earth is being accomplished. Risk assessment of narrow options is a classic example of using certain bits of information in such a way as to exclude feeling and to artificially sever connections of parts to the whole. Risk assessment rips you</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (and others) </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">out of connection to the rest of the world and reduces you</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (if you are even considered at all in the risk assessment) </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">to a number. </span></u><u>You</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> are then </span><u>consigned to damage or death or “risk,” depending on how your number is shuffled around in models</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, assumptions, and formulas enduring “risk management.” </span><u>Assessment of the pros and cons of a range of reasonable alternatives allows the connection to remain</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The cultural emotions connected to a given alternative, for instance, can be a pro or a con, and may be both, depending on which sector of the community you inhabit. An advantage or a disadvantage of a given alternative can be social, religious, economic, scientific, or political. Risk assessment is one of the major methods by which parts (corporations such as Monsanto or Hyundai, “private land owners,” industrial nations) can act on their wants at the expense of wholes (eg, whole communities and countries, or the seventh generation from now) without appearing to be doing so. Risk assessment lets them appear simply “scientific” or “rational” as they numerically estimate whether or how many deaths or what birth defects will be caused, and ignore other regions of human experience that also matter to people. Always, some groups of humans will be trying to exercise their power at the expense of the whole. </span><u>Decisions arrived at from risk assessment can be homicidal, biocidal, and suicidal</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, but they are made every day. Risk assessment is a premier process by which illegitimate exercise of power is justified. </span><u>The stakes of installing alternatives to risk assessment</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, therefore, </span><u>are the whole Earth</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (just as are the stakes of fashioning democratic control over corporations, or of requiring changes in behavior of those who have wreaked irreparable damage). Installing alternatives assessment is one step in the struggle to use information, feeling, and a sense of relationship to others to stop social-environmental madness. </span><br />

<u>There is no doubt that <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">profits made from human trafficking are enormous</span>.

The United Nations believes that the <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">trafficking of human beings is now the third largest source of money for organized crime</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, after arms and drugs. 9 </span><u>It has become the world’s fastest growing criminal enterprise</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, an estimated $9.5 billion per year. </span><u>The commodities involved in this illicit trade are men, women, and children and the trafficker’s goal is to maximize profits</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>The sale and distribution of trafficked humans in the U.S. is a global, regional, and national problem.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> 10 Attracted by huge profits made at minimal risks to the trafficker, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">criminal organizations at all levels are now involved with this heinous crime</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The fall of communism, coupled with deteriorating third world economies, has fueled the dramatic rise of this form of commerce. 11 </span><u>An ounce of cocaine wholesale is $1200 but you can only sell it once<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">, a woman or child</span> $50-$1000 but <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">you can sell</span> them each day <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">over and over</span> and over <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">again</span> (30 to 40 customers a day), and the markup is unbelievable</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. 12 </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Trafficking humans – especially children…enables these international mobsters to play in the wider field…of trafficking drugs, weapons</span>, arms, chemicals, toxic waste, and even piracy on the high seas. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Research substantiates indisputable links between human trafficking and organized criminal syndicates the world over</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. 13</span><br />

<u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Transnational organized crime contributes to and thrives on the recent and growing trend of ungovernability that is undermining the ability of many states to carry out their traditional functions</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Ungovernability is defined as &quot;the declining ability of governments worldwide, but particularly in the Third World, to govern and carry out the many and various responsibilities of managing a modern state in an increasingly complex environment</span><u>.&quot; <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Ungovernability is characterized by a decline in the rule of law</span>, stagnating economies, and <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">deteriorating infrastructures</span>.
