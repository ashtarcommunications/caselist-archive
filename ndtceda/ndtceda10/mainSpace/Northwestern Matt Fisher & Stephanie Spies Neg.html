Auctions CP<br />
<strong>CP text vs. Emory IW (from BK)--Quarters</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The United States federal government should establish a sealed-bid, single-price auction system for the distribution of tradable visa permits to employers wishing to sponsor employment-based visas for noncitizens that hold advanced degrees in science or technology from accredited universities in the United States. Auctions should take place quarterly, with an initial yearly allocation of 280,000 visas. The non-disclosed target price for visa permits should be $10,000. Subsequent allocations of visas should rise proportionally when the average price of permits was above $10,000, and fall proportionally when the average price was below $10,000, in the prior auction. If the allocation of permits disproportionately favors large companies, the United States federal government should set aside an adequate number of permits on which for small companies to bid.</strong><br />

The impact to genocide transcends mass death---it deprives life of meaning and requires an ethical response<br />
Card 3 – Claudia Card, the Emma Goldman Professor of Philosophy at the University of Wisconsin, 2003, “Genocide and Social Death,” Hypatia, Vol. 18, No. 1, p. 63-79<br />
&quot;Yet Yet such atrocities, it may be argued, are already war crimes, if conducted during wartime, and they can otherwise or also be &quot; AND &quot;meaninglessness of one's life and even of its termination. This view, atrocities… however, is controversial.&quot; controversial.<br />
<br />
Genocide CP---2NC<br />
Genocide should come first in your decision calculus---obviously it causes the mass death of millions but the impact also transcends numerical body counts---the intentional annihilation of an entire distinct cultural or ethnic group destroys the very social fabric of humanity. It renders both life and death valueless because it severs the connection between any individual’s death and future generations who could understand and make that death bearable or meaningful---this ethical distinction should elevate genocide in your impact assessment---that’s Card.<br />
<br />
Outweighs the case-- genocide of millions of people clearly outweighs whatever violence happens at the border because of visa restrictions.<br />
<br />
And turns it---genocidal regimes by definition employ preemption and securitization against their populations---means only the CP takes a stand against preemption and security politics globally<br />

<br />
Solves the case---<br />
The CP’s specific exclusion can’t link to their offense---it’s based on past actions with clear, internationally recognized criteria, so it can’t be preemptive---and it’s aimed at government agents---no chance for a slippery slope to new exclusions<br />
