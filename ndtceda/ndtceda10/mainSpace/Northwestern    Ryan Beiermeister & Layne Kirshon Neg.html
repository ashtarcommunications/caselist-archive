<strong>The United States federal government should establish a sealed-bid, single-price auction system for the distribution of tradable visa permits to employers wishing to sponsor employment-based visas for noncitizens that hold advanced degrees in science or technology from accredited universities in the United States. Auctions should take place quarterly, with an initial yearly allocation of 280,000 visas. The non-disclosed target price for visa permits should be $10,000. Subsequent allocations of visas should rise proportionally when the average price of permits was above $10,000, and fall proportionally when the average price was below $10,000, in the prior auction. If the allocation of permits disproportionately favors large companies, the United States federal government should set aside an adequate number of permits on which for small companies to bid.</strong><br />

First, the framework—the aff’s epistemological understanding of security is profoundly gendered—it situates the state as the center of power relations and objectifies everything outside the blinders of predictive security discourse—this calls into question their entire political strategy Tickner 1 [Ann professor at the School of International Relations USC.
