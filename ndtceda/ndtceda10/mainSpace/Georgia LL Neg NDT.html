Solves Federal Signal – 2NC<br />
CP solves the signal 100% ---<br />
A) Content – it boosts visas in a manner identical to the plan. Their evidence says this is sufficient and doesn’t distinguish based on the actor. Good is good enough, even if the plan is a little better, no “collapse” into their impact.<br />
B) Mechanism – they assume “pure states”, not a hybrid system. The CP establishes a framework of federal involvement – that’s Collins. This boosts the signal of federal commitment.<br />
