<span class="Underline"><strong>Cap K:</strong></span><br />
<span class="Underline">Democracy and cap are illusions that allow the worst atrocities by allowing the government to say “it could be worse, but at least it’s not the worst” – this rush to fine evil everywhere keeps us blindly worshipping the golden calf</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Badiou 2001 (“On Evil: An Interview with Alain Badiou” Cabinet magazine online, issue 5, winter 2001/2)</span><br />
<span class="Underline">The idea of the self-evidence of Evil is not…real projects depends on it. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">US Heg is virtually synonymous with the expansion of global capitalism- US power makes capitalist globalization feasible</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Deber 2002 (People before profit: the new globalization in the age of terror, big money, and economic crisis)</span><br />
<span class="Underline">The secret of globalization has rested on…that serve as handmaidens to global corporations.</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Cap makes was and extinction inevitable</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Brown 5 (Charles, may 13th 2005)</span><br />
<span class="Underline">The capitalist class owns the factories, the banks…shameful fact of life in the U.S.</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Rejection is the only way to overcome the capitalist system—prevents wage slavery and extinction</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Herod 4 (“Getting Free” sec. 6)</span><br />
<span class="Underline">It is time to try to describe at first…possibly even to extinction.</span><br />
<span class="Underline"><strong>Immigration advocacy trope analysis (on case):</strong> </span><br />
<span class="Underline"> </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Framework – immigration advocacy trope analysis is a necessary starting point for debating policy reform – our alternative is best understood as critical policy analysis</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Lara, Greene, and Bejarno 9 (“A critical analysis of immigration advocacy tropes: how popular discourse weakens solidarity and prevents broad, sustainable justice”)</span><br />
<span class="Underline">The reader many be tempted…orientation of social movements. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">1AC is bad and should be understood in historical context – the US empire was built on the backs of immigrants and maintained via their instrumentalization</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Lovato 8 (New America Media, <em>The Public Eye Magazine,</em> V23, #1 Spring) </span><br />
<span class="Underline"> </span><br />
<span class="Underline"> </span><br />
<span class="Underline"><strong>Schlag:</strong> </span><br />
<span class="Underline">There’s no connection between their plan and the enactment of politics. Without a way to move beyond normativity, the affirmative is nothing more than blindly choosing moral values to espouse that we have no possibility of leaving the sphere of legal thought</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Schlag 90 (“Normative and Nowhere to Go”)</span><br />
<span class="Underline">So much for the top ten of…”normative” change as well. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">The question of what we should do in the face of crisis is useless if we don’t know where we stand in the face of politics</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Schlag 91 (“Normativity and the politics of form” University of Pennsylvania Law Review, Vol. 139, No. 4 April 1991) </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Against this backdrop of…competing normative perspectives. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Possibility of the affirmative impacts in a world of debate is a reason to vote neg- the language games normative legal thinkers engage in preclude any authentic dialog on how to resolve policy issues</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Schlag 90 (“Normative and Nowhere to Go”)</span><br />
<span class="Underline">All of this can seem very funny…meta-insurance adjustment business. </span><br />
<span class="Underline"><strong>Aspec:</strong></span><br />
<span class="Underline">When the aff took on the mantle of “USFG,” they accepted the colonialist legacy and their refusal to acknowledge that link is itself a perpetuation of the contemporary practices of power that produce and maintain networks of oppression</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Shanara 8 (“The harsh realities of “acting black”: how African-american policy debaters negotiate representation through racial performance and style”)</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Mitchell observes that the stance…opponents to do the same. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Vote neg on presumption – plan lacks jurisdiction</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Saito 7 (“crossing the line? Examining current US immigration and border policy: Border constructions: Immigration enforcement and territorial presumptions” Gender Race &amp; Just. 193)</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Even if we accept the current reality…enforce border and immigration policies</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Disad outweighs case- colonial domination culminates in total devastation</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Jaimes 92 (Univ. of Colorado, The State of Native America: Genocide, Colonization, and Resistance) </span><br />
<span class="Underline">For the great mass of…existence ultimately rests. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Combating this colonialism requires we step away from the 1ac</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Alfred 99 (Taiaiake, Peace, Power, and Righteousness, pg 79)</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Freeing ourselves from…relationships, and structures. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">In each instance of policy advocacy, we must move in one directions or the other, so the choice is mutually exclusive. Voting neg provides us with the proper framework for challenging the false and insidious premises of the 1AC</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Saito 7 (“crossing the line? Examining current US immigration and border policy: Border constructions: Immigration enforcement and territorial presumptions” Gender Race &amp; Just. 193)</span><br />
<span class="Underline">In the United Nations’ mandates…case-by-case basis. </span><br />
