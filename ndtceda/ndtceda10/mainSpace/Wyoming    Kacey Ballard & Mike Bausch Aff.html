CONTENTION ONE IS A CRITIQUE OF THE DOMINANT TRAFFICKING NARRATIVE:<br />
<br />
First, the T-visa program is constructed from a trafficking narrative that inhibits its effectiveness. The cooperation requirement and the narrow definition of who constitutes a victim of severe forms of human trafficking disqualifies the vast majority of applicants<br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Antonio is not alone. The … deserving trafficking victim.</span><br />
<br />
And, the intent of the drafters of the TVPA to emphasize protection over law enforcement has been subverted. Now, in order to be recognized as a victim, a migrant must play into the narrative of their victimhood and cooperate with attempts to prosecute their traffickers<br />

<br />
And, U.S. trafficking policy was formed and supported by neoconservatives. Congress’s enactment of the TVPA was due in large part to their framing of helpless and innocent victims in need of protection from the barbaric other.<br />

<br />
<span class="underline">Trafficking policy in the …they were coerced</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
And, this narrative has its roots in the Bush era but extends across party lines, the following are two examples of the top level of our government invoking images of innocent victims violated by foreign criminals to rhetorically construct a framing of the trafficking phenomenon as an affront to U.S. ideals.<br />
<br />
<br />
The first is a speech given by Bush to law enforcement officials in Florida<br />
<br />
Bush in 2007<br />
(George W., former president of the United States, “G. W. Bush Announces Initiatives To Combat Human Trafficking”, transcribed from a youtube video located at <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi9mCTxkDh8" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi9mCTxkDh8</a>)<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">I am honored to be with </span><span class="underline">…will lead the fight against it</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><br />
<br />
And, Obama continues to promote this narrative<br />
<br />
Obama in 2008<br />
(Barrack, the president of the United States, “Obama on Human Trafficking”, transcribed from a youtube clip located at <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://traffickingproject.blogspot.com/2008/08/obama-on-human-trafficking.html" rel="nofollow">http://traffickingproject.blogspot.com/2008/08/obama-on-human-trafficking.html</a>)<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">This has to be a top …</span><span class="underline">like that taking place</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><br />
<br />
<br />
And, dominant media accounts of trafficking collude with the government’s narrative that conflates sex slavery and human trafficking. As one prominent New York Times editorial piece exemplifies, these stories are told to induce fear and cooperation from a public already panicked over our porous borders and the harm they could bring to an otherwise white, peaceful neighborhood<br />
<br />
Landesman in 2004<br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The house at 1212 1/2 West …</span><span class="underline"> beaten and sometimes killed</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><br />
<br />
And, the application of this Good/Evil dichotomy emphasizes the innocence of victims and reproduces fear and anxiety over the dark, foreign criminals who threaten our way of life. These narratives doom anti-trafficking efforts to failure.<br />
<br />
Berman in 2010<br />
(Jacqueline, PhD. Principal Analyst, Berkeley Policy Associates, “Biopolitical Management, Economic Calculation and ‘‘Trafficked Women’’”, International Migration, Vol. 48 (4) 2010)<br />
<br />
<span class="underline">A nefarious underworld populated … in trafficking networks</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.4</span><br />
<br />
And, this narrative sensationalizes the sexual and criminal aspects of trafficking and justifies sovereign intervention through the biopolitical management of the “trafficking victims” population. We need to unpack this discussion before we can properly redress the trafficking phenomenon<br />
<br />
Berman in 2010<br />
(Jacqueline, PhD. Principal Analyst, Berkeley Policy Associates, “Biopolitical Management, Economic Calculation and ‘‘Trafficked Women’’”, International Migration, Vol. 48 (4) 2010)<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Why is this narrative of …</span><span class="underline"> how to redress it</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />
<br />
And, these discourses are tied to the functioning of the state and the exercise of sovereign power. Women’s bodies have become a site of surveillance for the state to distinguish between the pure citizen and the impure foreigner that allows for the violent removal of any threat. These discourses enable a vicious biopolitics that reinforce gendered and racialized distinctions in the name of preserving the political community.<br />
<br />
Berman in 2003<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Jacqueline, Rockefeller Fellow, CUNY Graduate Center, New York, USA, “(Un)Popular Strangers and Crises (Un)Bounded: Discourses of Sex-trafficking, the European Political Community and the Panicked State of the Modern State”, European Journal of International Relations, 9:37, pMUSE)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">As I have discussed</span><span class="underline">, in their …the political community.</span><br />
<br />
And, this law and order approach to sex trafficking ensures that t-visas function as a device to assist prosecutors, shifting the burden on exploited migrants to prove their innocence and coercion. This framing uses sexual harm as a justification to restrain women’s movement and guarantees the marginalization, stigmatization, and criminalization of sex workers and migrants alike<br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Moshoula Capous Desyllas, 4th year Ph.D. Student in Social Work and Social Research at Portland State University in the Graduate School of Social Work, “A Critique of the Global Trafficking Discourse and U.S. Policy”, Journal of Sociology &amp; Social Welfare, December 2007, Volume XXXIV, Number 4)</span><br />

And, the administration’s framing enables migration management, a disciplinary technique that furthers the biopolitical agenda of the state. This narrative turns the trafficked body into a site of production marked by sovereignty and capital that renders life bare<br />

Contention Two is our method<br />
<br />
The role of the ballot is to open spaces of resistance to the dominant narratives of trafficking. <br />
First, Narratives construct ontology. We must beign by investigating how master narratives shape power relations<br />
<br />
Kirkscey in 2008 <br />
(T. Russel, M.A. Communication Studies, &quot;Finding Opportunities: A Reevaluation of Narrative Theory and Praxis in Communication Studies,&quot; Thesis presented to the Graduate Council of Texas State University-San Marcos, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://ccommons.txstate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1001&amp;context=comstad" rel="nofollow">http://ccommons.txstate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1001&amp;context=comstad</a>)<br />
<br />
These same fundamental issues surround humans... as a tool for appraising the purpose of rhetoric <br />
<br />
And, re-framing the trafficking narrative from a gender and immigration perspective is critical to avoid conflation of trafficking and sex slavery, the production of security threats and the construction of racialized foreign enemies <br />
<br />
Berman 2010<br />
(Jacqueline, PhD. Principal Analyst, Berkeley Policy Associates, “Biopolitical Management, Economic Calculation and ‘‘Trafficked Women’’”, International Migration, Vol. 48 (4) 2010)<br />
<br />
Given the over-simplicity and failure... tropes that haunt the debate.<br />
<br />
Finally, the 1AC is a discursive act of resistance to the dominant trafficking narrative. Anything less than constant criticism will form a new narrative ripe with the biopolitical structures of the status quo, this means only the aff can solve<br />

<u>(</u>_) <u>We cannot separate our politics from the narratives we are embedded in</u>: the dominant trafficking narrative is an episodic event that features the law enforcement saviors and the innocent damsels in distress, which shapes policy responses and public attitudes towards human trafficking. Your decision to reject or embrace a particular narrative can either promote peace or fuel violence<br />

Framing is a prerequisite to policy formulation. Only by engaging the gendered and racialized stories that construct the dominant images of trafficking can a new politics emerge<br />
