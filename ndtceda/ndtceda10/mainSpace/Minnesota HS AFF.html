<strong>Contention 1: OMG, we’re all going to get AIDS</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Current Queer migration is dominated by heteronormativity and hegemonic forces. Queer migrants don’t escape domination though their migration , rather the domination is restructured as they pass through the border. They don’t escape anything, rather, they become tool for the continuation of hegemonic forces. Heteronormativity is inherently unstable, and needs an external, anxious threat to sustain itself. The queer migrant becomes that threat, which continuously props up and reproduces heteronormativity.</strong><br />

Queer migration scholarship… in particular ways.<br />
<br />
<strong>Because the Queer Migrant is viewed by heteronormativity as different, and threatening, we seek to control it. The USFG creates a state of exception using the Queer Migrant as the fictionalized enemy, allowing for the continuation of the state;s right to kill</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>The attempt to control and secure the Queer migrant is based on the “risk society” of neoliberal discourse. The idea that the queer migrant is a threat is the product of heteronormative discourse.</strong><br />

My hypothesis is… fear or unease.<br />
<br />
<strong>Heteronormativity is inherently unstable. It is constantly putting up borders to protect itself from the queer. This is the same way heteronormativity operates in this room, in debate. Debate is heteronormative: Just wait until the 1NC, there will be a bunch of Framework, or T: borders put up to keep the queer from penetrating the debate space</strong><br />

<strong>Therefore, My partner and I stand resolved: That the queer migrant is not a threat, but an opportunity to breakdown the heteronormative discourse which dominates our lives.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Contention 2: Lets get Critical, Critical!</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Our refusal to take up the tradition subject position created by the resolution and the debate community opens up a space for the queer subject to be free of the regimes of the status quo. This is a necessary first step in the creation of a new kind of politics which is key to rupture the hegemonic forces and open up new regimes of thought.</strong><br />

<strong>The USFG is a sexualized state. It’s heteronormativity is built on and sustained by the notion of heterosexual marriage. What is important to note is that this is the product of ideology, and through discussion of the queer subject we rupture the dominant forces which manage queer migration</strong><br />

For the most… immigrants' imagined desire?<br />
<br />
<strong>Any attempt to challenge dominant ideologies must begin by challenging the assumptions of those ideologies. This is the most vulnerable point of intervention, and therefore a prerequisite for breaking down heteronormativity.</strong><br />

Direct action— actions… that topple empires.<br />
<br />
<strong>Contention 3: Role of the Ballot</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The role of the ballot in this debate should to take up the position of a critical intellectual. A critically intellectual approach is key to challenging dominant hegemonic forces. Debate is an academic activity, and therefore, the most effective solvency mechanism we will ever have is to be critical. The signal sent by our criticism will outweigh any from specific policy proposals.</strong><br />
