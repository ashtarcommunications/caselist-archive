<strong>Whiteness K</strong><br />
<br />
(The links tend to change with each aff but this is the Basic Shell)<br />
Whiteness manifests itself through the use of representations, and the manipulation of those representations to reify a world of “reality” that will best benefit those who reside on the powerful side of white supremacy….<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Yancy ‘04</span></strong><br />
<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 8pt;">[George Yancy, Review Editor of the <em>American Philosophical Association Newsletter on Philosophy and the Black Experience</em> . “Introduction: Fragments of a Social Ontology of Whiteness.” In George Yancy, ed., <u>What White Looks Like: African-American Philosophers on the Whiteness Question.</u> 1-24.]</span><br />
<strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 12pt;">&quot;One way of challenging whiteness is to interrogate its ontology, its being, as expressed through its imperial and hegemonic gaze. . .</span></u></strong><br />
<strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 12pt;">a world that whiteness then denies having given birth to, a possible slippage between knowing and being is often difficult to encourage.&quot;</span></u></strong><br />
<br />
<br />
Another very important manifestation of whiteness is its invisibility. This is what makes it so powerful. Because it is invisible and not “explicit”, then it also becomes fluid and changing. We would like to identify the difference between racism and whiteness. Because “racism” has been defined by most as a physical objective characteristic, we full that we can do things to “solve” this problem. The civil rights acts thought that if we attacked “racism” there would finally be an end to inequalities, but it actually only gave us this false faith that racism was gone, while it then slide between the cracks, behind the laws, and in the bricks and fields of the prison system. This whole conception of being able to “solve” a problem through external means is what we will identify as transcendance… This is also how whiteness continues to manifest itself, through the bad faith thought that we have transcended the inequality or that you have a “universal” tool to address the problem, allows that which is undone to be more powerful than what you think you have “solved”…<br />

<br />
<strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 8pt;">&quot;freedom is the most fundamental truth of human existence, and it is ultimately freedom that one flees in a spirit of bad faith.</span></u></strong><br />
<strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 8pt;">we humans can embrace our freedom and the exalting privilege of responsibility that accompanies it. We can refuse to deceive ourselves. We can embrace the ambiguities of our existence.</span></u></strong>&quot;<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Our argument is simple. We feel that a politics of whiteness should be rejected because of the ontological manifestations that they perpetuate. Politics built upon an ontology of whiteness function to reproduce the powerful norms of white supremacy in a different and ever changing mode. By making whiteness visible, by identifying it within the political and social methodologies, we can begin to effective combat the powers of white supremacy that make all of the problems discussed in the previous speech inevitable.</span><br />

The plan is characterized by a disavowal of tragedy. The triumph of Socratic reason manifests in our attempts to resolve the chaotic aspects of life and avoid suffering. This requires the construction of an ideal world towards which our apparent world aspires. In the modern drive towards certainty and security in an attempt at renouncing insecurity, the plan labors to mold and order the world to make it duplicate our idealized image.<br />

According to Nietzsche...principle of modernity.<br />
<br />
The affirmative will always be able to locate some external threat to world oder. Breaking News occurs every fiften minutes because international politics are unpredictable. The insecurities citied by the affirmative are not unique; international terrorism is an every-present threat, and there might just be poison in our children's halloween candy. Uncertainty and risk are part and parcel of human life. At issue here is not just life itself but what makes life valuable. We encourage indifference and carelessness in a world inherently characterized by insecurity in an attempt to reclaim joy from the affirmative's paranoid tiptoeing.<br />

&quot;The political subject of violence&quot; ed. David Campbell and Michael Dillon, p 101-105<br />
One must begin...risks and benefits.<br />
<br />
The infinite and non-linear causes of violence are too broad and vast to be predicted and responded to effectively-attempts to prevent disasters ultimately lead to bureaucratic mishandling which magnifies the problem<br />

<br />
The world is will to power and nothing besides. The image of the dangerous other we must protect ourselves against is a power seizure, it is the realization of only one possibility. Instead of accepting this as moral law, we should see it for what it is, merely a expression of one will to power.<br />
Ciano <strong>Aydin</strong> lecturer in Phil @ Radbound U &quot;Nietzshce on Reality as Will to Power: Towards and Organization-Struggle' Model.&quot; <em>The Journal of Nietzsche Studies 33. Spring 2007.</em><br />
We can begin...always remain possible.<br />
<br />
<br />
In answer to the affirmative’s schizophrenic call to action, our alternative is to *Do nothing in the instance of the plan* This is an acceptance of the inevitability of pain and uncertainty and a refusal to struggle against it. This radical openness engenders an understanding that pain isn’t negative in and of itself and allows us to take joy in our pain.<br />
Nietzshce, 1879.<br />

<strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The 1AC is a typical response to the issue of immigration and remains profoundly silent on the question of the very land subject to access and migration towards. The plan action serves as a mask for the state, making it appear benevolent, even as its existence is contingent upon a continuing legacy of colonization that guarantees continued international exploitation and environmental degradation, turning the case. </span></strong><br />
