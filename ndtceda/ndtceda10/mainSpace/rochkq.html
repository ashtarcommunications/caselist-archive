All applicants for immigrant visas… Class A medical conditions that could make an immigrant inadmissible. <br />

Biomedical diagnosis reduces people to machines, objects and examinable parts. This dehumanization serves to reinforce all objectionable social hierarchies <br />

It is important to consider the social… or classifications of health. These ‘dangerous diagnostics’ also appear in surveillance policy. <br />
<br />
The United States Federal Government should substantially expand beneficiary eligibility for its visas for the following: employment-based immigrant visas, nonimmigrant temporary worker visas, family-based visas, human trafficking-based visas by eliminating Article 212 Section (A) subpoints (iii)(iv) of the Immigration and Naturalization Act. <br />

Modern medical practices are the prime biopolitical mover <br />

Casting certain non-citizens as undesirable is a core function of biopolitics <br />

At a pragmatic glance … , productive, economic goals of the state. <br />
<br />
The history of exclusion of immigrants indicates that times of Economic Contraction correlate with Xenophobic Nationalism that will attempt to justify exclusion of the so-called mentally unhealthy. Negative arguments should be viewed as attempts to justify eugenic exclusion. <br />

In the last quarter of the nineteenth century… xenophobia in the history of U.S. immigration law. <br />

The core reason for INA health exclusion is Eugenics <br />

Neither the act nor the legislative … were rejected on this ground.5 <br />

Separating desirable and undesirable populations along the lines of mental health is a core function of biopolitics – this is a process of disciplining the soul <br />
DONNELLY 2005 (Robert A., “Immigrant and Healthy Agency, The Center for comparative immigration studies, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ccis-ucsd.org/PUBLICATIONS/wrkg128.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.ccis-ucsd.org/PUBLICATIONS/wrkg128.pdf</a>) kenJ <br />
I draw upon a variety of theorists … more &quot;unhealthy&quot; individuals within a polity. <br />

Biopower &amp; Eugenics necessitates genocide for the sake of the health of the population <br />
<br />

<br />
Hence the radical transformation … the enemy become absolutely indistinguishable. <br />

Foucault 84 <br />
<br />
(Michel, Director of Institute Francais at Hamburg, THE FOUCAULT READER p. 259-260. KNP) <br />
Since the classical age… guarantee an individual's continued existence. <br />
<br />
<br />
Visa policy presents us with an opportunity to engage in critical resistance against this biopolitical control. Saying no to the historical disciplinary power of immigration restrictions may seem piecemeal or anti-revolutionary; however, this act of refusal is resistance to the master-narrative of the biopolitics. <br />
<br />
Kelly Lecturer in Philosophy at Middlesex University 2009 Mark The Political Philosophy of Michel Foucault p 109-111  <br />
<br />
“To say no is the minimum form of resistance… may pale in comparison to that of the perpetrator. <br />
<br />
This historical investigation presents us with the opportunity to be critical intellectuals; our method is essential to producing resistance across the spectrum of political struggles. Voting affirmative embraces the counter-art of being not governed quite so much. We aren’t promising anything radical, just a chance for a different aesthetic of resistance. <br />
<br />
Kelly Lecturer in Philosophy at Middlesex University 2009 Mark The Political Philosophy of Michel Foucault p 129-131 <br />
<br />
Clearly, the role Foucault prescribes here… Foucault seeing intellectuals as obligated to resist power. <br />
<br />
This act of resistance is an ethical –political response – our refusal of the master-narrative of history is an act of self-relation which produces a politics which is capable of ethical actions. <br />
<br />
Kelly Lecturer in Philosophy at Middlesex University 2009 Mark The Political Philosophy of Michel Foucault p 150-151 <br />
Now, Foucault (PE 377) in the same 1983… which mediate the code in producing “the ethical subject.” <br />
Our resistance is outside of the notion of politics as war – this epistemology of power structures the totality of the way we know the political which guarantees continued violence <br />
