The debate surrounding immigration is never complete- they are merely snap-shots controlled by risk managers to describe an always incomplete picture of reality based on the anticipation of future threats; however, this coupling of security and immigration highlights the exact moment where security interest converge with immigrants bartering for ground are constantly taken back to justify never-ending violence<br />

<br />
Securitization of immigration...chaos and urban insecurity.<br />
<br />
The ability to control the flow of information and situation of immigrants forces the same the same rigged bargain as the postwar Civil Right Compromise: The price extracted in exchange for the legitimacy of action is accepting the current terms of debate which means that the official solutions elites and reformists advocate must remain blind to the linkage between race and the imperialism of American capital.<br />

 <strong>plan</strong>: the United States federal government should no longer consider security grounds in determining eligibility for employment-based immigrant visas, nonimmigrant temporary worker visas, family based visas, and human trafficking-based visas.<br />
<br />
<strong>The visa regime exists to rein in the threat the mobile migrant represents – the process creates categories of migrants and eligibility for immigration is determined by the exclusion of risky migrants - the ultimate outcome renders ALL applicants as potential risks to be managed</strong><br />
Mark B. Salter, Professor of in the School of Political Studies @ the University of Ottawa, 2006 (“The Global Visa Regime and the Political Technologies of the International Self: Borders, Bodies, Biopolitics,” Alternatives, 31, 167-189)<br />
The visa is a necessary supplement AND norm of regularly occurring fraud.4<br />
<br />
<strong>What qualifies as a risky migrant when applying for a visa is linked with ethnic identity and country of origin – the applicants who happens to look a particular way or comes from one of the “countries of concern” – This is done in the name of security</strong><br />

<strong>These visa policies are about the securitization of migration – central to this practice is a discourse of fear that equates migrants with terrorists – the result are practices ethnic profiling and forms of discrimination that make exclusion assured.</strong><br />

The securitization of migration discourse has AND in the netlike exercise of power.<br />

<strong>Discourse is central to the process of legitimating force and exceptions—the framing of imminent threat justifies exceptionalist behavior</strong><br />

The Copenhagen School’s theoretical framework rejects AND of construction of an existential threat.<br />

<strong>Furthermore, this discourse of securitized migration is about the anticipation of risk – it mirrors the politics of preemption that attempt to prevent migration before it can even become risky</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>Reverting to worst case scenarios in the context of immigration creates a certain type of knowledge about migrants that will always make them the object of violence – risk NECESSARILY fixes their position as scientifically and objectively always already the targets of bombs</strong><br />

<strong>Unpacking the securitization of migration should begin at the level of visa restrictions – it’s intersection with other operational nodes of risk management make it the most relevant starting point</strong><br />
