<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">our relationship to death both defines the processes of choice and deliberation and the value to life. SUBJECTIVITY falls out of this relationship making each inauthentic response a unique refusal to take on the task of making death our own.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the affirmative’s concern with escalating war is more than a pragmatic concern. it is an expression of existential anxiety. we ought to refuse politically polemic contestation in favor of an existential realization of anxiety.</span><br />
