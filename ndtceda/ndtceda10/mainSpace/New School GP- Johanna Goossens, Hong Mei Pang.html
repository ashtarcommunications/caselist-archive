Their 1ac FW for the round is whoever best disrupts white citizenship<br />
<br />
Their advocacy is to affirm the migrant figure.<br />
<br />
2ac talks a lot about a piece of Brinkley(sp?) and Reid evidence about performing the body within the space of debate. They use this ev as a catch all for a lot of args. They claim this as their internal link to disrupting white citizenship within the debate space.<br />
<br />
The initial narrative is about the 1A's experiences in debate- about being perceived as a Towson debater, but not being radical enough.<br />

<strong>Narrative on white privilege</strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">Immigration as a phenomenon, understood within the context of American nationalism produces a ladder of assimilation for the immigrant. How does the nation-state produce itself to define the belonging of Others? How does collective identity justify violence? The policy-oriented discussions that is brought forth by the resolution attempts to liberalize and expand the bodies that exist within America, but these bodies do not necessarily belong. Bodies are relegated to become calculable figures to justify one policy option or another. Lives are disposable to the logic of capital, and personhood erased. Immigration unfolds into the ways that the state purports an ideological figure—that of the normative citizen. Immigrants are juxtaposed and bodies are marked and exiled into the periphery. We don’t account for the lives that are affected after these policies. Violence becomes possible because they are undesirable, they are threats to the stable narrative that legitimizes America’s imperialism domestic and abroad.<br />
<br />
We begin with a critical affirmation of the immigrant within the resolution. It is to affirm the lives of those who would be affected by visas, by illegality and by the ways America define its populous and does violence to those who are relegated to the margin of the nation state. The ballot is an endorsement of our politics that centers around the figure of the immigrants. It sends a message to the debate community that we need to reorient our politics toward the material realities of immigrants.<br />
<br />
The resolution functions as the law that codifies experiences of immigrant debaters and debaters of color and erases the lived experience by treating oral histories as afterthought. Narratives are threats to the stable coherence and otherwise smooth functioning debate space. Those who are intimately tied to the topic are crowded out in the argumentative bombardment of policy debate through instrumentalization of the topic.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Instead, we should center our political alternatives around the violence that immigrants undergo and to better their material realities. The ballot should be awarded to who better performatively deconstructs white citizenship within debate. We best do this because our advocacy centers on the figure of the immigrant in order to elucidate the complex legalistic forms of oppression which constraint the political possibilities for meaningful and happy lives for immigrants.<br />
<br />
Thus, we affirm the figure of the immigrant within the topic<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The ideal American citizen is racialized within particular sociological and historical contexts. Examining the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1886 as the first instance of American gatekeeping, legal disenfranchisement of immigrants is an apparatus to sustain the power of whiteness in granting political, economical, and social ‘rights’, while reducing the immigrant to disposable and unassimilable labor for the expansion of American capital. Asian/American immigration served as a foundation for understanding immigration in contemporary times.<br />

&quot;there are two....Communitst countries&quot;<br />
<br />
The racialization and exploitation of Asian/Americans is central to the formation of the ideological violence behind the US nation-state. Casted as forever foreign the Asian/American subject poses a threat to expose the dominant order and violence purported in the name of the American ideal citizen.<br />

&quot;The emergence of... national culture&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Race, therefore, is not confined to the white supremacy within the national identity that structurally exploits people of color. The notions of citizenship and belonging create a synergy between capitalism and racism. Domestically, the US populous is defined collectively through its nation-state objectives that are used to do violence abroad in the name of cultural difference. Citizenship qualifies a sophisticate form of differential racism, one that is at the root of war. We are willing to attack America’s external Other because they pose a threat. Similarly, the same logic justifies the proposal to send illegal immigrants to internment camps in Florida because they pose a threat to the internal coherence of America. This epistemic violence transposes to material violence of genocidal proportions.<br />

&quot;to emphasis.....what follows&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;">Affirming the figure of the immigrant, thus, constitutes an Immigrant act. It is to recover from historical amnesia to assert my agency and the agency of other immigrants whose lives we talk about. </span><br />
