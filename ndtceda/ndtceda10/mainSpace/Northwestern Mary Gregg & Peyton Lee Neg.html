c) USCIS will revert to citing Supreme Court precedent to justify denying H-1Bs that don’t meet the control requirement---means the plan changes nothing <br />

Country Quota CP---1NC <br />
<br />
The United States federal government should eliminate limits on the percentage of employment-based permanent residence visas that may be allotted to individual countries. <br />
<br />
Solves the case:<br />
Country quotas mean only 9,800 green cards go to each country per year---the CP makes the distribution of visas under the cap reflect actual demand <br />

Gov't L. Rev. 358<br />
There are over 140,000… because of oversubscription.53<br />
<br />
Net-beneficial:<br />
Eliminating the country quota avoids politics and resolves the need to expand the cap<br />

Any reform of US immigration laws is… States from any one country.<br />
<br />
Country Quota CP---2NC---Solves the Case <br />
<br />
The CP generates large enough levels of immigration to solve the case:<br />
<br />
a) Demand only exceeds visa availability for countries limited by the country quotas---the CP would eliminate the backlogs---and it’s perceived by employers <br />

Gov't L. Rev. 358<br />
The per-country quota… the employment-based immigrant system.<br />
<br />
b) There’s no backlog for EB-1s---and backlogs for EBs 2 and 3 are caused by the country quota <br />

The situation is the same… green card backlogs.<br />
<br />
Eliminating the country quota makes the overall cap irrelevant:<br />
<br />
a) Country quotas mean the cap can go unfilled despite demand<br />

In this NFAP analysis… because of the per country limits.”7<br />

b) Eliminating country quotas means no new green cards are necessary <br />

Rep. Zoe Lofgren… workers on a first-in, first-out basis.”<br />
<br />
The CP means the same functional increase in visas as the plan:<br />
<br />
a) Eliminating the cap on STEM graduates would only add 36,000 green cards a year<br />

Overall, we calculate that… the U.S. labor force in 2008.<br />

Bodyshopping CP---1NC<br />
The United States Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services should submit the Neufeld Memorandum’s definition of control as applied to third-party employers for publication-and-comment as proscribed by the Administrative Procedures Act. <br />
<br />
The United States Congress should not strike down the application of the Neufeld Memorandum to third-party employers as a legitimate interpretation of existing immigration law. <br />
<br />
The United States Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services should issue a precedential decision that it will not interpret any legislative provision to restrict visa eligibility unless directed by Congress. <br />
<br />
The United States Supreme Court should rule that the definition of control applied to self-employed and independent contractor petitioners for H-1B visas in the Neufeld Memorandum is unconstitutional because it violates the publication-and-comment requirement of the Administrative Procedures Act.<br />

Competes---Neufeld’s definition of control restricts third-party body-shops---the plan overturns it <br />

 The 1AC includes an explicit demand that, quote, “Our engagement with this resolution demands that we investigate our relationship to others. We feel that this investigation must not only begin with an analysis of the topic, but an analysis of ourselves as well.” <br />
The demand that we narrate a coherent account of ourselves does violence because our narratives can never be anything but incomplete--- the self can never fully tell the story of its own emergence and our self-understandings are not symbolisable in narrative form. Yet the 1AC would condemn this failure as an ethical deficit---this condemnation itself forecloses ethical relationships and mutual understanding. <br />

full and satisfying notion of narrative accountability? <br />
<br />
<br />
Their performance amounts to a demand that we answer the question “who are you, and what have you done?” This posits them as a moral authority with the capacity to condemn those whose self-disclosure is deemed ineffective or incomplete. Condemnation abandons the project of building self-knowledge and annihilates any potential for ethical engagement.<br />

In this sense, recognition could not be reduced to ...<br />
, in the name of &quot;ethics,&quot; to damage and destroy lives with impunity. <br />
<br />
In contrast to their advocacy that sets up self-narration as a <u>pre-requisite</u> to engagement with the topic, we advocate a recognition that while self-engagement can often form the basis of an ethical politics, the deferral of self-narration can also open onto equally ethical practice---our own recognition of our opacity to ourselves enables a recognition of the same in others <br />

In approaching solutions to the brain drain… be presented and examined below.<br />
<br />
Explicit linkage between brain tax’s revenue and the ways that sending countries use it is key---otherwise it doesn’t contribute to growth and development <br />

Understanding the complexity of… contributions of this article.<br />
<br />
Means the perm links to the net-benefits---putting revenue from the brain tax into the general budget fuels inefficiency and waste---doesn’t generate any positive returns <br />

As already explored, there… increasing mechanisms at that.<br />
<br />
The tax will be blocked in sending countries if it’s perceived the government could waste the revenue <br />
Brauner 10 – Yariv, Professor of Law, University of Florida Levin College of Law, July 2010, “Brain Drain Taxation as Development Policy,” University of Florida Legal Studies Research Paper No. 2010-17, online: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1636845" rel="nofollow">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1636845</a><br />
An equally important reason… anyway likely to be wasted.<br />

<br />
Brain Tax CP---AT: Circulation---2NC <br />
<br />
Brain drain happens before circulation can kick in---the CP immediately solves the impact by creating revenue that gets recycled into sending countries’ economies <br />

(1) Fair share of the spoils…. not just a potential one.<br />
<br />
Human capital investments require upfront investment and locally-generated knowledge---brain circulation doesn’t solve either <br />

As the World Bank Development… many areas of the economy and society.<br />
<br />
<br />
Brain Tax CP---AT: Administrative Feasibility---2NC <br />
<br />
The only practical obstacle is lack of cooperation---the CP unites sending country taxes with host country cooperation in enforcement <br />
Brauner 10 – Yariv, Professor of Law, University of Florida Levin College of Law, July 2010, “Brain Drain Taxation as Development Policy,” University of Florida Legal Studies Research Paper No. 2010-17, online: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1636845" rel="nofollow">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1636845</a><br />
In conclusion, the interest… if the political will existed.<br />
<br />
Implementation is feasible and effective---international financial cooperation proves <br />

 The United States Federal Government should exempt current holders of H-1B visas residing in the United States from minimum monetary investment requirements for employment-based fifth preference visas and make available employment-based fifth preference visas to holders of H-1B visas residing in the United States whose commercial activities will generate required levels of jobs for non-family members in the United States upon the conclusion of their H-1B visa eligibility. <br />
<br />
Competes--&gt; <br />
1) The plan establishes <u>required levels of investment and revenue</u> as a condition for visas, the CP eliminates them---can’t do both. <br />
<br />
2) The plan specifies eligibility for <u>immigrant</u> entrepreneurs---the CP makes visas available to temporary non-immigrant workers---means the perm links to the net-benefits. <br />
<br />
The word “immigrant” in the plan means the visa recipients <u>have to come from outside the U.S.</u><br />
