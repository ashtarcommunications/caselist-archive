<strong>Immigration flow has not always been restricted. Rather immigration policy is rooted in a biopolitical separation between the homogenous population of the United States, and the dangers otherness. Current visa restrictions come from an initial policy aimed at restricting the flow of the majority of Chinese workers, only allowing the most beneficial in.</strong><br />

<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Visa restrictions are an act of border drawing that serve as the first layer of skin to the homogeneous population, seeing borders as true epistemologically structures individuals into categories of inside and outside. </span></strong><br />

<br />

<strong>The challenge is to criticize these modalities of technology – the attempt to control populations is ultimately a plurality of technologies of the body which regulate political rationalities, knowledges and discourses. This power regime of truth encourages the violence which plagues the international system</strong><br />

<br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Individuals applying for Visas are framed under the position of a positive effect on the social or a negative danger. There exists no space outside of this binary application, as Visa reviews attempt to fit applicants into a particular political subject that can be traced, monitored and disciplined. </span></strong><br />

<br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Visa restrictions are based on the biopolitical understanding of foreign populations as a reserve of workers to extract at will. This epistemological understanding of otherness structures difference only in terms of threat or economic value. </span></strong><br />

<br />
<strong>The Visa restrictions are applied based on a reduction of individual’s to previously assume behavioral traits. This is not done from a neutral perspective, but rather is done under a constant mistrust of the Visa applicant under the search for the real reason for entry to the country.</strong><br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Resistance comes first – though many misread Foucault’s analysis of power as subordinating resistance to power, it is resistance which ontologically precedes power. Our act of resistance is necessary for the creation of a subject because it opens the possibility of resistance against the self.</strong><br />

<br />
<br />
<strong>This act of resistance is an ethical –political response – our refusal of the master-narrative of history is act of self-relation which produces a politics which is capable of ethical actions.</strong><br />

It’s just another day at the port. Officers with checklists search every ship coming into the US for stowaways. This securitization against the stowaway is the epitome of the banalization of security and risk management<br />

This assault on difference, in the name of security, strikes away at all that makes life worthwhile. Only through an embracement of the inevitability of difference and security can we affirm life<br />

<br />
<br />
The world is will to power and nothing besides. The image of the dangerous stowaway we must protect ourselves against is a power seizure, it is the realization of only one possibility. Instead of accepting this as moral law, we should see it for what it is, merely an expression of one will to power.<br />
