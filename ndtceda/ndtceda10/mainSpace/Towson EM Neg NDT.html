 <br />
A debate, in the traditional sense, did not happen in this round. There were no “sides,” no traditional normative statements about the truth of the resolution or hostile cross examinations. This is not to say something productive did not come of this. In fact, the opposite is true. This was a strategy session in which an in depth discussion of the methodologies to deal with privilege inside, and outside, of the debate community was discussed. <br />

<strong>The debate community is guilty of :</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>1. Silence on th issue of white supremacy and how it has been essential to shaping this debate activity through norms and procedures</strong><br />
<strong>2. Objective disconnected narration in which no aff or neg has a burden to explain their personal agency in relation to their advocacy</strong><br />
<strong>3. Having a managerial approach to dealing with racism instead of seeking to eradicate white supremacy</strong><br />
<strong>4. A performance of a hegemonic aesthetic</strong><br />
<strong>5. An investment in an ahistorical laboratory</strong><br />

<strong>Plan text: the debate community should confront black rage.</strong><br />
<strong>Black rage consists of the following:</strong><br />
<strong>It is based on righteous indignation, or anger at injustice and suffering</strong><br />
<strong>It is composed of 4 specific components:</strong><br />
<strong><span style="text-indent: -0.25in;">1) Deliberate challenge to white supremacy en-route to producing anti-white supremacist scholarship.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="text-indent: -0.25in;"> 2) The use of some counter-hegemonic aesthetic (which includes music, poetry, visuals, etc…)</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="text-indent: -0.25in;"> 3) Advancing the subject hood of people of color.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="text-indent: -0.25in;"> 4) Must perform one’s spirituality enroute to liberating the oppress that is rooted in ourstory</span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong>the rest of the 1nc is poetry about the debate community and the politics of black rage including the following cards..</strong><br />

&quot;First, one must realize that whiteness is a structure of domination...to engage in organized violence against non-whites.&quot;<br />

<strong>Increasing Immigration within the current system of power relations would only further prop up a new multicultural/multinational whiteness where we find new and interesting people to brain wash into American systems of power. This does nothing to change the fundamental conditions of black people in America and only serves to use multiculturalism as a tool for global capitalism. Only a refusal to even recognize whiteness can solve, meaning any permutation is doomed.</strong><br />
Olson, 2004<br />
(Joel, “The abolition of democracy” p. 118-121)<br />

Sometimes, all that is solid melts into… task of the final chapter<br />

<strong>What we see depends on from where we look. Their view of globalization is just wrong and dangerous manifestation of their flawed epistemology they view it as an even flow around the world that can spread equally, like a soft ocean tide. It’s more like a violent white water rapid, emphasis on WHITE, flowing only to certain white places and churning up brown bodies that fall into it. Their naturalization of globalization cements it in our minds as inevitable, glossing over all the violence executed in the name of “helping” brown people take part in it. This impact turns all their “getting away from the nationalism solves violence” stuff. The world of globalization is just a less VISABLE method of cracking brown skulls</strong><br />
Ferguson, 6<br />

This is assuredly not to say transnational… inequalities seen in human history to date<br />

<strong>The issue is not coalitions good/bad, but how they are centered. The black intellectual must control the nature of the critiquw to avoid cooption and assimilation</strong><br />
Harold Cruse, 1967<br />
(“The Crisi of the Negro Intellectual: A Historical Analysis of the Failure of Black Leadership”)<br />
These American peculiarities pose acute problems…the imperitive of the Negro social dynamic.
