<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span class="tagChar"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>The visa regime operates via an ideology of separation—in the interview room, subjects are forced to participate in a confessionary complex where they must reveal their identities in a benign manner to the INS agent. This self-policing reduces their subjectivities to abstractions shaped by sacred, social scripts, and is at the foundation of biopolitical management</strong></span></span>. </span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span class="tagChar"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>The ideology of separation that manifests itself in the visa regime is also reflected within policy debate. Debate has evolved from an exclusive forum for future policymakers to a paradoxical community that is ungrounded and constantly shifting. For example, what it means to be resolved has undergone scrutiny—kritikal affirmatives interrogated what it means to be the subject of the resolution, and the proliferation of these perspectives show how there is no single, universal way to affirm. Yet, to maintain policy debate’s location as the intersection between competition and education, some participants continue to engage in sacred rituals to produce absolute, prima facie issues that determine what is and isn’t productive debate. The maintenance of the sacred requires ritual acts of sacrifice in the name of linguistic commonality—debaters are forced to disclose their arguments in a manner intelligible to the majority, which mandates the destruction of alterity</strong></span></span>. </span><br />

<br />
<br />
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">In an attempt to uphold the sacred altar of fairness in debate, many members of our community voted for a resolution that condemns the topic of immigration solely to a discussion of visas, which eliminates core questions that do not lie within the bounds of what the community thinks is predictable. But, the resolution can’t be reduced to the brief verbal portrait shaped by its anonymous framers and discourses of power—our affirmation is a gesture of belonging-to-impropriety that reveals the central emptiness of the resolution and simultaneously makes reading it possible while exceeding its sacred intent. </span></strong></span><br />

 Incest—Baudrillard says their attempt to perfect debate is the final nail in the coffin because it forces finality upon it—this plea for uniformity is akin to the sex of what we have now with where it came from—this destroys debate and turns their standards<br />
Baudrillard, 01 (jean, prof of philosophy at European graduate school, <u>impossible exchange,</u> p. 34-5)<br />
“a double, contradictory movement<br />
Lurching into the void”<br />
The more the right is opposed, the more authority it gains because Baudrillard 90 saays we concede to the truth claims that feed the illusion of power—makes fill-in inevitable<br />
Baudrillard 97 (Jean, prof of philosophy at EGS, May 7, “a conjuration of imbeciles”)<br />
“There has been a shattering reformulation<br />
Used to mean something”<br />
Terminal defense: Baudrillard 81 says political reality is a purely operational stasis because subjects are engendered by all models at once, resulting in oversaturation and breakdown—engaging in the political cant change the squo<br />
Baudrillard 81 (Jean, prof of philo at EGS, Simulacra and Simulation, p. 1-3)<br />
“if once we were able to view<br />
Simulated generation of differences”<br />
This attempt to constitute our subjectivities fail, we inject the ultimate does of political realism through genocidal fascism<br />
Baudrillard 81 (jean, prof at EGs, Simulacra and Simulation, p. 48)<br />
“Fascism, itself, the mystery<br />
Is a response to that”<br />
<h1 id="toc5"><a name="x2ac K"></a>2ac K</h1>
 Annihilation of everything—management of evil is the root cause of violence—Baudrillard 96 says the annihilation of negativity ensures the erasure of the radical other<br />
Deleuze, 06 (ex-prof of philo at Vincennes, Translation by Tomlinson, Nietzsche and philosophy, p. 108)<br />
“as a result of this type<br />
And symbolic in principle”<br />
Adopting the strategy of the subject is one that breeds self-hatred because we repress our object status—this perpetuates suffering and tragedy<br />
Saurette 96 (Paul, “I mistrust all systematizers and avoid them: Nietzsche, Arendt, and the crisis of the will ot order in International Relations Theory”, Millenium Journal of International studies. Vol.25 number 1 p. 3-6)<br />
The expectation that people should be answerable for every aspect of their situation is impossible—we are forced to root out all seductions that don’t fit within the framework of transcendental values causing nihilism<br />
Agamben 93 (Giorgio, prof of aesthetics @ U of Verona, the coming community, p. 64-6)<br />
“But the absurdity of individual existence<br />
Task of our generation”<br />
Their claim that everyone has to engage in responsible struggle transforms the appeal of immanent affirmation to a transcendtal call to arms against the SQ—this self management consumes the human experience<br />
Zupancic (Alenka, philosopher at University of Ljublijana, “the shortest shadow: nietzsche’s philosophy of the two”, p. 47-52, evidence under erasure)<br />
“it might seem that the notion of the<br />
Freud recognizes the paradigm of “religious” thinking.”
