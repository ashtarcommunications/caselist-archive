<u><strong>Spending Disad</strong></u><br />
<br />
A. Uniqueness<br />
Obama is committed to bringing down the deficit through reduced spending – blueprint proves<br />
Brian Riedl, Grover M. Hermann Fellow in Federal Budgetary Affairs at the Heritage Foundation, The Washington Times, October 5, 2010, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/oct/5/riedl-obamas-historic-spending-cut-plans/" rel="nofollow">http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/oct/5/riedl-obamas-historic-spending-cut-plans/</a><br />

&quot;The TVPA also grants immigrant victims&quot; and &quot;necessitate additional services or referrals.&quot;<br />
<br />
C. Impact <br />
1. Spending is on the brink – increased spending will prevent business investment preventing a recovery <br />
Daily Caller 10/8 (Caroline Salas, Thomas Keene, 10/8/10, &quot;Greenspan says US creating 'scary' deficit as borrowing rises &quot;, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://dailycaller.com/2010/10/08/greenspan-says-u-s-creating-scary-deficit-as-borrowing-rises/" rel="nofollow">http://dailycaller.com/2010/10/08/greenspan-says-u-s-creating-scary-deficit-as-borrowing-rises/</a>)<br />
&quot;&quot;We’re involved in a dangerous game,&quot; Greenspan said&quot; and &quot;crimp the U.S. economic recovery, he said.&quot; <br />
<br />
2. Lack of investment causes a double-dip recession<br />
Investment News, September 12, 2010, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.investmentnews.com/article/20100912/FREE/309129974" rel="nofollow">http://www.investmentnews.com/article/20100912/FREE/309129974</a><br />
&quot;Joseph H. Davis, chief economist and head&quot; and &quot;given the lack of regulatory clarity.&quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
3. Double-dip recession will cause a decline in the US economy and global economy<br />
McIntyre, CEO, 24/7 Wall Street and former Editor-in-Chief of Financial World Magazine, August 16, 2010:<br />
[ 24/7 Wall Street, What the Double-Dip Recession Will Look Like, [Douglas A.], p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://finance.yahoo.com/career-work/article/110344/what-the-double-dip-recession-will-look-like" rel="nofollow">http://finance.yahoo.com/career-work/article/110344/what-the-double-dip-recession-will-look-like</a>]<br />
&quot;This is what a double-dip recession would&quot; and &quot;700 banks and mortgage lenders were shuttered.&quot;<br />
<br />
4. World economic collapse will roll back democracy and cause global wars<br />
Tilford, former history professor at Grover City College, 2008:<br />
[Critical Mass: Economic Leadership or Dictatorship October 6, Earl, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.visandvals.org/Critical_Mass_Economic_Leadership_or_Dictatorship.php?view_all=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.visandvals.org/Critical_Mass_Economic_Leadership_or_Dictatorship.php?view_all=1</a>]<br />

&quot;Unfortunately, the polarizing atmosphere&quot; and &quot;necessary 67 votes is not a given.&quot;<br />
<br />
Impacts<br />
1. New START treaty is key to preventing a Cold War with Russia, a nuclear arms race, global proliferation, undermining crisis stability -- this would dramatically increase the <span style="background-color: fuchsia; color: black;">risk</span> of accidental war with Russia<br />
Stephen Blank, &quot;Russia and Arms Control: Are There Opportunities for the Obama Administration?&quot;, 2009, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/pub908.pdf" rel="nofollow">www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/pub908.pdf</a><br />
&quot;Similarly, under the circumstances&quot; and &quot;with a corpse in the cargo.&quot;<br />
<br />
2. US-Russian nuclear arms race increase the <span style="background-color: fuchsia; color: black;">risk</span> of nuclear war and extinction<br />
Bill Wickersham, The Missourian, April 30, 2008, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.columbiamissourian.com/stories/2008/04/30/us-russia-need-reverse-arms-race/" rel="nofollow">http://www.columbiamissourian.com/stories/2008/04/30/us-russia-need-reverse-arms-race/</a><br />

AT: START kills PGS Turn<br />
<br />
Conventional PGS capabilities are not restricted by START<br />
Kingston Reif, &quot;Joseph and Edelman Wrong on New START&quot;, June 23, 2010, p. nukesofhazardblog.com/story/2010/6/23/174512/662<br />
&quot;New START will count ICBMs&quot; and &quot;for example, boost-glide systems&quot;<br />
<br />
START will not prevent deployment of conventional PGS -- Bolton's claims are false<br />
Dennis Gormley, September 20, 2010, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.securityconsensus.org/2010/09/15/bolton-is-still-wrong-on-start/" rel="nofollow">http://www.securityconsensus.org/2010/09/15/bolton-is-still-wrong-on-start/</a><br />
