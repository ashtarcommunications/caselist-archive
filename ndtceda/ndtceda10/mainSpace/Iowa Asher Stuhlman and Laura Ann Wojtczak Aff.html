<a name="_GoBack"></a>Contention 1: The Past <br />
Contention One is the Past:<br />
The history of US visa policy is riddled with errors, but none so grave as the refusal of visas to the victims of the Shoah. The affirmative begins with the account of American visa policies prior to and during World War II and the implications for our indifference to genocide. <br />
Culbertson 94 (Katherine Culbertson for the Hanover Historical Review, “American Wartime Indifference to the Plight of the European Jews”, 1994. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://history.hanover.edu/hhr/94/hhr94_5.html" rel="nofollow">http://history.hanover.edu/hhr/94/hhr94_5.html</a><br />
In April 1943 the Warsaw ghetto was ravaged <br />
AND <br />
the perpetrators, but the bystanders as well.<br />
Moreover, 1938 was a crucial turning point. As the determination of the Nazis to exterminate the Jews became clear, the United States instituted more restrictive visas policies. The affirmative’s exploration of visa policy, the stamp on a piece of paper, is critical to understand American apathy and complicity in the Nazi genocide. The stamp was the difference between life and death. <br />
Zucker 2001 Zucker, Bat-Ami Senior Lecturer at Bar-Ilan University, Israel. In search of refuge: Jews and US consuls in Nazi Germany, 1933-1941. p.171-2 <br />
The year 1938 was a turning point not <br />
AND <br />
is the difference between life and death'.'<br />
<br />
And, Lowered and unused visa quotas demonstrate the implications of restrictive immigration policies – they caused the daily massacres of hundreds of thousands. The visa policies of the US were not mere inaction but pushed victims into the wheels of the Final Solution machinery. <br />
Perl 1989 William law degree from the University of Vienna, retired Army lieutenant colonel, Holocaust survivor, scholar and founder of the Washington branch of the Jewish Defense League who organized a little-known rescue effort that smuggled thousands of Jews out of Nazi-occupied Europe The Holocaust Conspiracy: An International Policy of Genocide p. 68-9<br />
As to generosity, let us have a <br />
AND <br />
could apply for entrance into the United States.<br />
<br />
Further, The visa was the only hope for those persecuted by the Nazis, the proof of a visa allowed thousands to leave. The Germans would have let them go, if and only if they had visas. The denial of visa applications by the US demonstrated to the Germans that the US would not take any measures to stop the genocide. <br />

There can be no reduction in German guilt<br />
AND <br />
of what we mean when we charge conspiracy.<br />
<br />
And, US inaction, particularly on visas and lowered quotas stimulated worldwide inaction. It signaled to every other country that no rescue attempt should be made. <br />
Feingold 1970 Dr. Henry Director of the Jewish Resource Center at Baruch College and Professor of History at Baruch College and The Graduate Center, CUNY. He received his Ph.D from New York University. The Politics of Rescue: The Roosevelt Administration and the Holocaust 1938-1945 p. 295-7<br />
On those occasions during the Holocaust years when <br />
AND <br />
to curtail the humanitarian activity of the Roosevelt Administration<br />
This moral complicity of the bystander in this instance is untenable and adheres throughout history. Only standing up against genocide can prevent extinction. <br />
Ketels ’96 Associate Professor of English at Temple University<br />
Even though, as Americans, we have <br />
AND <br />
and spirit, human responsibility, human reason.”<br />
Contention 2: Alternate Pasts<br />
Contention Two: The Alternate Past<br />
Resolved: In 1938, The United States federal government should eliminate all restrictions on and unconditionally increase the number of visas available to anyone fleeing persecution. <br />
This alternate history challenges the callousness of quotas and visa restrictions, it opens the padlocked door. <br />
Morse 1968 Arthur World War II historian , Executive producer of CBS Reports While Six Million Died: A Chronicle of American Apathy p. 148-9<br />
Throughout the prewar and wartime years Franklin D<br />
AND <br />
had been extinguished and the door was padlocked.<br />
<br />
The example of shipping proves the immorality of US visa policies, there were thousands of spaces on empty ships crossing the Atlantic throughout the war. Simply opening visas policies would have allowed thousands to escape. Even if the plan would not have stopped the genocide, simply saving one life is the only morally correct action. <br />
Wyman 1984 David S. Ph.D. in history from Harvard University, Prof. of History at the University of Massachusetts Amherst The Abandonment of the Jews: America and the Holocaust 1941-1945 p. 335-6<br />
None of these proposals guaranteed results. But <br />
AND <br />
the State and War departments blocked the plan.&quot;<br />
<br />
Further, The American commitment to open visa policies would have convinced the world to allow the persecuted to enter their countries.<br />
Wyman 1984 David S. Ph.D. in history from Harvard University, Prof. of History at the University of Massachusetts Amherst The Abandonment of the Jews: America and the Holocaust 1941-1945 p. 332-3<br />
Locating enough outside havens, places beyond continental <br />
AND <br />
those thousands could have been scores of thousands.<br />
<br />
Contention Three: Framework<br />
Our interpretation is that the affirmative is required to present a plan that is a justification for the resolution – which is more liberal visa policies, either in quotas or eligibility. The affirmative proves the resolution true.<br />
We meet this interpretation. Our affirmative is a case in which the US should have had more open visa policies, both in terms of quotas and eligibility. <br />
The interpretation that fiat and should mean “in the future” is bad - <br />
A. All policy thinking is counterfactual – fiat assumes imagining that the world is different than it actually is. There’s no difference between any possible negative framework interpretation and ours. This is justification for reasonability. <br />
Kenneth T. Broda-Bahm 1999 Ph.D. Southern lllinois University) is an Assistant Professor and Director of Speech and Debate at Towson University CONTEMPORARY ARGUMENTATION AND DEBATE 20 (1999): 1-23. A COUNTERFACTUAL THEORY OF FIAT<br />
All statements about the effects of plans and <br />
AND <br />
making false assumptions&quot; (179-80).<br />
B. Should is the past tense of shall. <br />
MacMillan Dictionary No date “Shall” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/shall" rel="nofollow">http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/shall</a><br />
Should can sometimes be used as the past <br />
AND <br />
that I should not need to defend myself.<br />
<br />
C. The temporal distinction of should is semantically useless. The time of should does not alter the truth condition of the normative statement. <br />
Ana Arregui 2010 “Detaching If-Clauses from Should1” Assistant Professor. Linguistics Department. University of Ottawa Natural language semantics, 2010 <br />
According to the semantics for should in (<br />
AND <br />
), and you would have changed your mind.<br />
C. We meet any interpretation that demands future action - Counterfactuals are about the future – <br />
DAVID LEWIS 1979 Counterfactual Dependence and Time's Arrow PRINCETON UNIVERSITY Noûs, Vol. 13, No. 4, Special Issue on Counterfactuals and Laws (Nov., 1979), pp. 455-476<br />
Today I am typing words on a page<br />
AND <br />
depends on the way things will be later.<br />
Three offensive theoretical justifications for our framework – <br />
1. Contingent history is critical to solve genocide - <br />
The counterfactual alternative history is critical to challenging traditional frameworks of history that represent events as an objective and natural record of the past. Counterfactual thinking is necessary to understand that genocide is not inevitable, but a contingent condition of history which makes agency in the face of evil a necessity. <br />
Lang 1999 Berel B.A from Yale University in 1954, and his Ph.D. in philosophy from Columbia University in 1961 Visiting Professor of Philosophy and Letters at Wesleyan University. The Future of the Holocaust: Between History and Memory p. 26-7<br />
Since efforts are still needed to describe for <br />
AND <br />
portentous for its-and our-present.<br />
<br />
2. Agency - Only the affirmative’s alternate processes of history allow critical-memory to work. This is necessary to think through trauma in a network of relations and creates the possibility of agency. <br />
LaCapra 1998 Dominick Professor of History and Bowmar Professor of Human Studies and Comparative Literature at Cornell History and Memory After Auschwitz p. 41-2<br />
The historian must work out a subject-<br />
AND <br />
the requirements of desirable action in the present.<br />
<br />
3. Better Policy Analysis – <br />
A. Counterfactuals histories are necessary to show that both the past and future are contingent and malleable. Only the recognition of this uncertainty in the process of counterfactual thinking solves. <br />
Lebow 2010 Richard James O. Freedman Presidential Professor of Government at Dartmouth Forbidden Fruit: Counterfactuals and International Relations p. 38-9<br />
In chapter 1 I noted the power of <br />
AND <br />
role of contingency in key decisions and events.<br />
<br />
B. These alternative histories are particularly critical in our current moment where terrorism is compared to Nazism. Only alternative histories of the Holocaust can allow us to understand the contingency of the present and the future. This stops US imperial actions like the invasion of Iraq. <br />
Rosenfeld 2005 Gavriel Associate Professor of History and Director of the Undergraduate Program in Judaic Studies at Fairfield University The World Hitler Never Made: Alternate History and the Memory of Nazism p. 395-7 <br />
It is far from certain how alternate histories <br />
AND <br />
world as we would like it to be.<br />
C. Counterfactual thinking is critical to overcoming cognitive biases in policy making that cause the problems of predictive thinking. <br />
Lebow 2010 Richard James O. Freedman Presidential Professor of Government at Dartmouth Forbidden Fruit: Counterfactuals and International Relations p. 17-8<br />
Finally, I show how counterfactuals can be <br />
AND <br />
rigorously their utility as starting points for theories.<br />
