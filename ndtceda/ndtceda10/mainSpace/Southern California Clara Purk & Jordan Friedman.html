<span style="margin-left: 0in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; text-indent: 0in;">The current discrimination against lesbian and gay individuals in the immigration system is grounded in a long history of exclusion. Immigration restrictions have been constructed by the government to exclude individuals on an economic, racial, geopolitical, and sexual basis. Examining the historical transformation of immigration provides us with a lens through which to formulate a struggle against this discrimination. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Yet we need to inquire whether the recognition of same-sex couple relation- ships will really provide the security that many advocates imagine.

<span style="margin-left: 0in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; text-indent: 0in;">From the very first immigration policy in the 1880s to the present, immigration law has historically been a mechanism for the state to survey and normalize those entering the United States. These policies have been used to maintain the current heteronormative order by excluding not only LGBT individuals, but any person from a different race, class, or geographic location that posed a threat to the nation’s heterosexuality. </span><br />

<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Historically, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">U.S. immigration control</span> </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">did not merely seek to contain these threatening figures; rather, it </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">served as a</span> crucial <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">mechanism for constructing, enforcing, and normalizing</span> dominant forms of <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">heteronormativity while producing these figures as</span> supposed <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">threats</span>. Changing family preferences in immigration law reflect these developments. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;

background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">were</span> steadily reconfigured by law as having families that were neither intelligible nor desirable</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, in part </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">because they were <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">deemed to lack the proper heterosexual couple as a foundation</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.30 Consequently, claims of family provided increasingly weak opportunities for legal immigration by people from Asia during the late nineteenth century and a significant portion of the twentieth century.31 </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Immigrants from Latin America</span> and the Caribbean also <span style="background-attachment: initial;

Thus </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">gender, racial, sexual, and geographic hierarchies organized family preference immigration</span> possibilities, including where couples were concerned. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">These hierarchies were inseparable from larger logics of empire</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.32 During the twentieth century, family preferences changed shape some- what. One of the most significant overhauls occurred </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">in 1965</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, when </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">explicit</span> racial and ethnic <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">preferences were dropped</span> from the law</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">; the preference system was altered to ensure that approximately 75 percent of all immigration slots would be allocated on the basis of family ties, and family was expanded to include not just the spouses, minor children, and parents of citizens or residents, but also their adult siblings. Nonetheless, as David Reimers has shown, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">in elevating family preferences</span> to become the major mechanism for legal entry, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Congress calculated</span> that <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">this would enable continued European dominance</span> of the immigration stream, albeit <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">through deniable means</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.33 </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Family</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, in short, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">was intended to maintain a white racial order</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">It <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">was</span> also <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">intended to maintain</span> patriarchy and <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">heteronorma- tivity;</span> this latter is evident from the fact that the <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">preference for family was paral- leled by a renewed exclusion of immigrant lesbians and gay men</span>, this time under the category of sexual deviates</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Since legislators projected that only fathers would work for pay, while mothers and children would be consumers, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">family was also expected to serve a particular economic function</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Admittedly, congressional racial calculations turned out to be inaccurate, as Asian and Latin American migrants came to dominate the flows of family preference immigrants, and migrant families came to include multiple earners. In 1990 the ban on the immigration of individual lesbians and gay men was lifted, though no provisions were made for their intimate or family relationships.34 In 1993 Congress introduced a ban on the immigration of HIV-positive people, which also affected a family’s ability to reunify legally.35 As increased numbers of families of color and working-class families continued to enter the United States, the government and sectors of the public remained concerned. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Rather than restore explicit racial and ethnic exclusions, a new route</span> was taken. This <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">worked through discourses</span>, practices, and technologies of neoliberal privatization, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">resulting in laws that</span> strictly curtailed, or <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">ended</span> altogether, legal <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">immigrants’ eligibility for</span> public <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">benefits</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Changes</span> introduced <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">in 1996 specified</span> that <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">only those whose income was</span> at least <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">125 percent of the</span> U.S. federal <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">poverty level were eligible</span> to sponsor family members for legal immigration</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, no matter how fully their family form was recognized in law. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Heightened security measures</span> since September 11, 2001, which single out migrants from countries identified as “high risk” to the United States, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">combined with new antiterrorism laws</span> and expanding anticrime laws, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">have also greatly affected family-based immigration</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.36 The impact of these changes has included not just increasing preclusion, exclusion, and deportation of family members but also the freezing of millions of families into “mixed status,” such that individual family members have different legal statuses, to which varied rights, responsibilities, and jeopardies attach, effectively dividing them even when they share households and resources.37 </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The campaign to have same-sex relationships recognized as a basis for legal immigration seeks to remedy a clear injustice in the U.S. immigration system. Approximately 75 percent of all current legal immigrants enter the United States on the basis of family ties.16 Within this family preference system, married male- female couples effectively hold most privileged immigrant status. </span><span class="underline">The significance of heterosexual marriage as a mechanism for legally immigrating is highlighted by government statistics</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In 2005, the most recent year for which immigration statistics are available, the United States admitted 1,122,373 legal immigrants. Of these, 259,144 (or 23 percent) were heterosexual spouses of U.S. citizens.17 An additional 100,139 spouses and children of legal permanent residents were also admitted, though this group was subject to per-country quota limits.18 </span><span class="underline">Participating in <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">a male-female couple provides a clear</span>ly defined <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">route for becoming a legal immigrant, </span>which tells us something important about how <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">sexuality structures possibilities for becoming il/legal</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In contrast to male-female couples, </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">same-sex couples are shut out from using their relationships as a basis for legal immigration</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. No one knows exactly how many such couples are affected. But </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the 2000 census, which</span> almost certainly <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">undercounted same-sex couples</span>, provides</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> one snapshot.

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">An example of how </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">couple ties provide technologies for managing</span> risks associated with legally admitted <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">immigrants</span>, and for attempting <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">to transform these immigrants into good citizens</span>, is </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">provided by </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the “affidavit of support</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">” system implemented in 1997. Under the system, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">those sponsoring a relative for immigration must file a legally binding affidavit of support </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">with the immigration service, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">showing</span> that <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">their income is at least 125 percent of the</span> federal <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">poverty level</span> </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">for a family that includes themselves, the person they are sponsoring, and any other dependents. The affidavit remains in effect until the immigrant has become a citi- zen, accrues a ten-year paid employment history, permanently departs the United States, or dies. It is not voided by divorce, although in cases of abuse or battery of children or spouses, some requirements may be waived for twelve months.50 Sponsors may be required to reimburse the federal government for any benefits used by the immigrant during the period that the affidavit is in effect. Immigrants may also, in theory, sue their sponsors if the sponsor does not provide adequate support. As I have argued elsewhere, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">affidavits rely on</span> a <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">white, bourgeois logic of “heteronormativity</span> as responsibility” to redefine the terms on which immigrants are to be not only admitted to but also incorporated within the United States</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.51 This works at several levels. For one, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the affidavits reflect how heteronormative families are increasingly promoted by the state as a means to absorb the costs of unemploy- ment, unaffordable health care, and so on, within the broader neoliberal process </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">of sharply reducing all social welfare entitlements, and reallocating costs to the private home.52 Second, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">responsibility is conceived in terms that link economic imperatives to cultural norms that are</span> moralizing, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">heteropatriarchal</span>, and racist</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.53 Through their sponsors’ examples, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">immigrants are expected to internalize and live by these norms</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.

<span style="mso-list: none;">The state uses immigration laws to reinforce hegemonic heterosexuality- both by excluding lesbian and gay individuals and enforcing racial, gender, and class exclusions. Absent changing the framework of the immigration debate to confront these exclusions, scholars will only further hegemonic power relations. Examining the intersection of immigration and sexuality as well as race, class, and gender is crucial to truly radical politics. </span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">My analysis of the interface between immigration control and identity categories was most thoroughly developed in relation to women’s sexuality, though I also indicated its application to racial, ethnic, class, and nationality categories. Entry Denied suggests that although women’s sexuality has been a central concern of federal immigration control since the late nineteenth century, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">immigration officials never simply “uncovered” sexual identities or proclivities that already preexisted within immigrant women</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Rather, </span><span class="underline">multiple practices and discourses that varied by time, location, and the individuals involved were brought to bear upon immigrant women, in ways that contributed to producing the sexual identities, acts, and norms around which immigration monitoring was organized and regularly redefined</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">My focus on sexuality directly challenged the tendency in </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">immigration scholarship </span>to <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">ignore sexuality </span>altogether</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> or else subsume it into accounts of gender. Indeed, gender immigration scholarship has not substantially explored sexuality either. This may be understandable because, as Eve Sedgwick suggests, “the question of gender and the question of sexuality, inextricable from one another though they are...are...not the same question.” 3 Sedgwick’s point, that sexuality requires analysis on its own terms, needs to be acknowledged and addressed within immigration scholarship. In taking up Sedgwick’s call, </span><span class="underline">immigration <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">scholars</span> will <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">have to</span> guard against the presumption of normative heterosexuality</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. As Michael Warner explains, “het culture thinks of itself as the elemental form of human association, as the very model of intergender relations, as the invisible basis of all community, and as the means of reproduction without which society wouldn’t exist.” 4 </span><span class="underline">Entry Denied <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">challenge</span>s both the <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">erasure of sexuality and </span>the <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">presumption of normative heterosexuality in immigration </span>scholarship, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">by centering sexuality</span> while also making clear that not everyone is heterosexual.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Further, it argues that </span><span class="underline">far from being “natural,” <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">hegemonic heterosexuality is </span>anxiously manufactured and oppressively <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">enforced by </span>state <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">institutions that include </span>the <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">immigration </span>apparatus</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="underline">Since hegemonic heterosexuality is produced <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">through racial, ethnic, gender, and class exclusions, only certain immigrants’ heterosexuality becomes acceptable</span>, while others are slated for exclusion— along with the rest of the “peripheral” sexual groups</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.

Entry Denied engages in dialogue not just with immigration but also with sexuality scholarship. Here my concern is the fact that sexuality scholarship rarely addresses immigration, despite compelling reasons to do so. For instance, immigration has profoundly transformed sexual politics, communities, and cultural production in the last quarter century, in ways that demand attention. Furthermore, both immigration and sexuality have been at the forefront of public debate and legislative intervention in that same time period. Consequently, </span><span class="underline">examination of the ways that xenophobia and normative heterosexuality articulate one another is critical.

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">These are systematic and socially accepted injuries inflicted upon individu- als outside of the heteronormative mandate. </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Institutional violence is widespread for LGBTQ individuals and communities</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Undergirding all social institutions is heteronormative ideology (Berlant &amp; Warner, 1998; Richardson, 1996). Hege- monic heterosexuality permeates the family (VanEvery, 1996a, b), domestic and intimate life (Croghan, 1993; Holland, Ramazanoglu, &amp; Thomson, 1996; VanEvery, 1996b), education (Kumashiro, 2002; Pinar, 1998; Talburt &amp; Steinberg, 2000), social policy (Carabine, 1996; Eskridge, 2002; Kaplan, 1997), the mass media and popular culture (Fejes &amp; Petrich, 1993; Gross, 2001; Gross &amp; Woods, 1999; Ingraham, 1999), among others. In short, </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">heteronormative thinking is deeply ingrained</span>, and strategically invisible, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">in our social institutions</span>. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The process of normalization of heterosexuality in our social system actively</span> and methodically <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">subordinates, disempowers</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, denies, </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">and rejects individuals who do not conform to the heterosexual mandate by criminalizing them, denying them protection</span> against discrimination, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">refusing them basic rights</span> </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">and recognition, or all of the above (Kaplan, 1997; Rubin, 1984/1993). More simply stated, </span><span class="underline">the regulatory power of heteronormativity denies LGBTQ individuals and couples their citizenship. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">There are numerous “positive rights” (Stein, 1999, p. 286) that heterosexual individuals take for granted but LGBTQ persons are categorically denied. They include being able to marry a person of the same sex, gain custody of their children, become foster and adoptive parents, visit one’s same-sex part- ner in the hospital, being able to obtain bereavement leave when one’s partner passes away, being able to file joint income tax returns with one’s partner, among many others. Although the issue of same-sex marriage is highly con- tested on ideological grounds within LGBTQ communities in the U.S. (Yep, Lovaas, &amp; Elia, 2003), LGBTQ couples are deprived of the numerous rights and privileges accorded to heterosexually married dyads (Kaplan, 1997; Stein, 1999). In sum, </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">heteronormativity is a site of unrelenting</span>, harsh, unforgiving, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">and continuous violence for LGBTQ individuals</span></span><span class="underline">. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Such violence is everywhere: in the individual psyche and in collective consciousness</span>, in the individual per- ceptions and experiences and <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">in the social system and institutions</span>.</span> <br />

But most immediately and pervasively it is evidenced in the literal bloodbaths that seem to make the point of the AIDS related resurgence in violent bashings of gays—which, unlike the gun violence otherwise ubiquitous in this culture, are characteristically done with two-by-fours, baseball bats, and fists, in the most literal minded conceivable form of body-fluid contact.  </span></span><br />

The valuations of good and evil become fixed </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">insofar as they are given a transcendental meaning and ground in the development of Christianity which develops an elaborate theology in order to explain its various manifestations. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The categories of <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">normal and abnormal become fixed</span> </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">insofar as they are given an elaborate scientific meaning and ground in the development of psychiatry and criminology which develop complex rational justifications that replace the need for a transcendental foundation. But they also become fixed insofar as </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">they are developed as multifaceted and specific answers that reduce the problematic situations from which they arise to problems, answers given categorical status and extended to encompass all future problems. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The question</span> then, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">is to how actualize events in a different manner</span> or</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, to be more precise, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">establish the conditions under which a different actualization might take place</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. This is what Deleuze calls </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">'counter-actualization' </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(LS 151 et passim). It </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">is an attempt to return to the virtual structure of the event to pave the way for a new actualization</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The problem is that, if I have Deleuze right, we cannot isolate and individuate the virtual components of events as discrete elements since to do so is to make them present, to make them actual. That is, identifying and isolating them is to serialize them and repeat them in such as to bring them to bear on the present. A project of this sort would be an actualization of the virtual which would defeat the purpose of returning to the virtual itself. Moreover, it would reduce genealogy to history by re-introducing representation at the heart of genealogy. Such a project would presuppose that the virtual could be represented, that there are discrete, fixed events in history that contain the truth of the matter. Moreover, it seems to me that neither Nietzsche or Foucault function in this manner. Neither claims to identify the 'real' elements of our history that others have failed to perceive. Something else is at work here. That something is what Deleuze refers to as the problematic and Foucault as problematization. Deleuze contrasts the problematic with the problem. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The problem is a way of reducing the problematic character of things to something which has a solution</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Problems</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, as such, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">always <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">have specific and singular solutions</span>. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot;A problem always gets the answer it deserves.&quot; </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Events</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, on the contrary, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">remain problematic; they do not have solutions</span> </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">or, more to the point, they do not have solutions except insofar as they are actualized. This is a function of their temporal nature as always subsisting in the infinitive form of verbs, always in a state of becoming. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The problem is a reduction of this becoming to the present tense, an actualization of the virtual</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, infinitive structure of the event which allows for a singular solution that can be repeated without (much) difference. Here we see what Nietzsche and Foucault criticized in their respective genealogies. For Nietzsche, Christianity reduces the problematic character of will to power by reducing it to the problem of good and evil (and its attendant notions of free will and the passions). For Foucault, crime, with all its political, social and economic aspects, is reduced to the problem of delinquency, of a criminal nature that lurks in the 'souls' of men. Each problem produces an answer, whether it be eternal damnation or the prison or the answer which is common to both -- the war against the 'instincts.' </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">What <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">genealogy</span> does then</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, the difference it makes, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">is that it <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">returns to the</span> virtual structure of the <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">event by problematizing it</span>, by <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">re-actualizing it</span> in such a way as <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">to preclude a singular and specific solution</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">What marks genealogy</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, particularly the genealogies of Nietzsche and Foucault, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">is its inability to provide solutions</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Neither of the two had anything to say to their readers who asked when they finished their works -- &quot;What then?&quot; Foucault especially refused to provide programs for the reform or replacement of prisons, mental institutions or an ethics of sexuality. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Each sought to problematize anew problems that had supposedly been solved, problems that were only presented as problems</span> </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">to students by teachers who already knew the answers, problems no longer conceived of as real problems. To conclude: History, as opposed to genealogy, is the ordering of events in a single series that repeats those events within narrowly defined limits; it is for all intents and purposes the repetition of the Same. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">History is a narrative that reduces the problematic nature of the events it addresses to problems that have solutions; <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">solutions</span> that <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">are</span> also <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">repetitions of the Same</span>; solutions <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">that re-impose</span> or attempt to re-impose <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the values imbedded in a long history of errors</span>. History is the reproduction of a social memory that reproduces the tradition and imbeds it in our psyches, our social relations and our institutions. History actualizes, materializes that tradition. Genealogy is the attempt to re-serialize events</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Again, genealogy does not invent, discover or emphasize new or different events nor does it re-interpret events in order to discover hidden or sedimented meanings that have been neglected by the tradition. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">It is the attempt to counter-actualize the event, to return, in one form or another, to the virtual structure of the event in order to re-problematize the event. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The goal is not to find a new solution, to 'fix' history</span>,</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> to offer a better or truer history or account of the past. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The goal is to make the problem problematic, to make it a real problem once again, a problem we no longer know the answer to but for which we are compelled to find solutions</span>. Genealogy generates a counter-memory</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, a memory made of the same components as the memory of history but one in which those components have been repeated and re-arranged in a different manner, re-actualized along different and multiple series. Counter-memory is a mutation of memory. Genealogy functions as a virus that mutates our collective memory to the point where we can no longer remember or recognize the tradition that is embodied in our psyches, our social relations and our institutions. As such, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">it</span> forces us, or at least <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">allows us the possibility of</span>, re-membering and re-cognizing that tradition, of <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">finding a way to create our own problems and our own</span> local, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">specific</span> and finite <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">solutions</span>.

<span style="mso-list: none;">Sexuality is given meaning by the way it is used in society and communication- we are accountable for our discourse and the way it enforces or deconstructs the current heterosexual norms.

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Substantively, the LatCrit V program made major inroads along several trajectories. First, by centering issues of class and economic inequality in the production of LatCrit theory and discourse, LatCrit V took the long-foreshadowed step of challenging the dichotomization of class and identity in popular discourse and mainstream legal theory. n4 </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">This</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> [*1252] </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">dichotomization casts class and identity-based approaches to social justice transformation as a struggle between those who minimize the significance of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation and national origin in order to prioritize the significance of class and those who, on the other hand, minimize the impact of class stratification in order to prioritize identity-based subordination</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. n5 However, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">casting the struggle for social transformation in this &quot;either-or&quot; framework too often has derailed the struggle for substantive inter-and intra-group justice</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">It has</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> squandered much energy, good will and potential solidarity in distracting debates, and has </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">obscured the extent to which class inequalities are legitimated through the construction of superior/inferior identities</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, while identity-based subordination has been structured by a relentless history and continuing practices of material expropriation, exploitation and dispossession, both domestically and internationally. n6 Woven as an organizing theme throughout the LatCrit V program, the decision to center class inequalities within, among and between communities of color challenged these self-defeating dichotomies and revealed new insights and perspectives on the ways that </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&quot;class-based&quot; and &quot;identity-based&quot; structures of subordination converge to create distinct problems</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, among others, for women of color whose lived realities remain marginalized in critical analyses of the so-called &quot;feminization of [*1253] poverty;&quot; n7 for queers of color, whose class, race and citizenship status create particular problems that are elided as much by the politics of &quot;coming out&quot; through which liberation has been promised, urged and sought, as by the politics of assimilation through which relatively privileged gays and lesbians seek their inclusion in mainstream American society by compromising difference as the price of materially comfortable social tolerance; n8 and for immigrant workers of color, caught in the catch-22 of exploitation or deportation that structures their subordinate status in the resort industries of Colorado and elsewhere throughout the United States. n9 In each of these, and other, instances, as amplified in the symposium essays, LatCrit V displayed how </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">class stratification plays a significant role in the subordination of those who are multiply marginalized--as much by their outsider status in the politics of identity that privilege whiteness, maleness, heterosexuality</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and English proficiency as by the violence of material dispossession constructed </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">and perpetuated through the biases embedded in and across many different substantive fields of law and policy</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. n10 [*1254] These insights into the convergence of class and identity were further illuminated by the programmatic decision to use the lens of economic inequality to interrogate--from a raceconscious, class-conscious, anti-subordination perspective--the substance and structure of traditional business law regimes. n11 Centering the biases of United States tax codes, corporate laws and commercial laws revealed important new perspectives on the way the regulation of micro-enterprises, community development projects and the structuring of in/formal markets in impoverished communities reproduce the subordination of people of color across multiple identity categories. n12 These investigations showed in a myriad of particular ways and settings, ranging from the domestic to the international, how law organizes and enforces both social and economic inequality. Indeed, the presentations at LatCrit V repeatedly revealed the many different ways in which law is implicated in maintaining structures of power and privilege (as well as structures of illegality and lawlessness) that make socalled &quot;free markets&quot; decidedly unfree for all but socially dominant groups and legally privileged elites. In short, LatCrit V demonstrated time and again that </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">biases based on identity become formalized as law with the purpose and effect of materially enriching some identity groups, while dispossessing others, thus over time correlating &quot;class&quot; to &quot;identity&quot; and &quot;identity&quot; to &quot;class&quot; in structural, formal and normative ways</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. To the extent, and </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">as long as, this correlation continues to be engineered through the legal organization and enforcement of</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> [*1255] </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">identity-based economic dis/possession, class and identity remain undeniably &quot;cosynthetic.&quot;</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> n13 However, LatCrit V was more than a solidly programmed encounter. Like other LatCrit conference gatherings, the lived experience and emergent record of LatCrit V bear ample witness to a basic and fundamental insight of the LatCrit project. This insight--initially only a hopeful intuition, increasingly a defining praxis--grounds the production of knowledge in the performance of a living and learning community-building process. In this process, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the articulation of ever more inclusive visions of social justice and ever more penetrating analysis of the role of law in producing (and its potential for transforming) intra-and intergroup conflict is fundamentally and necessarily linked to the practices of embracing difference through the performance of sustained and mutual engagement, across our differences and over time</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. n14 The commitment to engage difference--as a communitybuilding practice--is a major and continuing challenge to each and all of us, both collectively and individually, precisely because it inevitably triggers moments of risk: one never can foretell for sure what the cauldron of diversities and perspectives that we call &quot;LatCrit&quot; will cook up. Thus, conference planners and participants never can predict what ruptures or disruptions will challenge us to seek higher levels of mutual understanding and engagement--or tempt us to retreat to the &quot;safety&quot; of sameness at the cost, ultimately, of our own isolation and continued dispersal. Measured against these background insights and aspirations, as well as the record of LatCrit's prior experiences engaging difference, both interpersonally and programmatically, the substantive and solidaristic achievements of LatCrit V beckon celebration and reflection but, as always, in a critical and selfcritical manner.</span><br />

<strong>The current discrimination against lesbian and gay individuals in the immigration system is grounded in a long history of exclusion. Immigration restrictions have been constructed by the government to exclude individuals on an economic, racial, geopolitical, and sexual basis. Examining the historical transformation of immigration provides us with a lens through which to formulate a struggle against this discrimination.</strong><br />

Yet we need to inquire whether the recognition of same-sex couple relation- ships will really provide the security that many advocates imagine. For the narra- tives of legal status as contingent and unstable alerts us to the fact that the ability to become legal hinges not on one factor but on crosscutting combinations of factors. Being gay or lesbian is one crucially important factor, but this has always intersected with other variables such as gender, race, class, and geopolitics that structure immigration opportunities and exclusions. A review of the history of U.S. immigration preferences alerts us to the importance of how these other variables intersect with sexuality to produce complex possibilities of exclusion and admis- sion, including under preferences for families in general and couples in particular. In turn, understanding this history suggests ways that the struggle for recognition of same-sex relationships may be usefully redefined and broadened. <br />
<br />
<strong>From the very first immigration policy in the 1880s to the present, immigration law has historically been a mechanism for the state to survey and normalize those entering the United States. These policies have been used to maintain the current heteronormative order by excluding not only LGBT individuals, but any person from a different race, class, or geographic location that posed a threat to the nation’s heterosexuality.</strong><br />

Historically, U.S. immigration control did not merely seek to contain these threatening figures; rather, it served as a crucial mechanism for constructing, enforcing, and normalizing dominant forms of heteronormativity while producing these figures as supposed threats. Changing family preferences in immigration law reflect these developments. In the early 1880s, federal immigration law admitted the family and friends of people already in the United States.29 By the 1890s, friends were dropped. Family remained, and in the first quarter of the twentieth century, it became delineated in law as the married conjugal couple and their minor children, preferably European in origin — ideally from northern or western Europe. Diverse Asian immigrants, by contrast, were steadily reconfigured by law as having families that were neither intelligible nor desirable, in part because they were deemed to lack the proper heterosexual couple as a foundation.30 Consequently, claims of family provided increasingly weak opportunities for legal immigration by people from Asia during the late nineteenth century and a significant portion of the twentieth century.31 Immigrants from Latin America and the Caribbean also found that their access to legal migration through claims of heterosexual family did not carry the same weight as for Europeans and Canadians — though family provided a ground on which at least to attempt to stake a claim. Thus gender, racial, sexual, and geographic hierarchies organized family preference immigration possibilities, including where couples were concerned. These hierarchies were inseparable from larger logics of empire.32 During the twentieth century, family preferences changed shape some- what. One of the most significant overhauls occurred in 1965, when explicit racial and ethnic preferences were dropped from the law; the preference system was altered to ensure that approximately 75 percent of all immigration slots would be allocated on the basis of family ties, and family was expanded to include not just the spouses, minor children, and parents of citizens or residents, but also their adult siblings. Nonetheless, as David Reimers has shown, in elevating family preferences to become the major mechanism for legal entry, Congress calculated that this would enable continued European dominance of the immigration stream, albeit through deniable means.33 Family, in short, was intended to maintain a white racial order. It was also intended to maintain patriarchy and heteronorma- tivity; this latter is evident from the fact that the preference for family was paral- leled by a renewed exclusion of immigrant lesbians and gay men, this time under the category of sexual deviates. Since legislators projected that only fathers would work for pay, while mothers and children would be consumers, family was also expected to serve a particular economic function. Admittedly, congressional racial calculations turned out to be inaccurate, as Asian and Latin American migrants came to dominate the flows of family preference immigrants, and migrant families came to include multiple earners. In 1990 the ban on the immigration of individual lesbians and gay men was lifted, though no provisions were made for their intimate or family relationships.34 In 1993 Congress introduced a ban on the immigration of HIV-positive people, which also affected a family’s ability to reunify legally.35 As increased numbers of families of color and working-class families continued to enter the United States, the government and sectors of the public remained concerned. Rather than restore explicit racial and ethnic exclusions, a new route was taken. This worked through discourses, practices, and technologies of neoliberal privatization, resulting in laws that strictly curtailed, or ended altogether, legal immigrants’ eligibility for public benefits. Changes introduced in 1996 specified that only those whose income was at least 125 percent of the U.S. federal poverty level were eligible to sponsor family members for legal immigration, no matter how fully their family form was recognized in law. Heightened security measures since September 11, 2001, which single out migrants from countries identified as “high risk” to the United States, combined with new antiterrorism laws and expanding anticrime laws, have also greatly affected family-based immigration.36 The impact of these changes has included not just increasing preclusion, exclusion, and deportation of family members but also the freezing of millions of families into “mixed status,” such that individual family members have different legal statuses, to which varied rights, responsibilities, and jeopardies attach, effectively dividing them even when they share households and resources.37<br />

<strong>It is now 2010, and the issue of the exclusion of LGBT immigrants has still not been remedied. Over 63,000 same-sex couples still cannot be legally recognized under the law.</strong><br />

The campaign to have same-sex relationships recognized as a basis for legal immigration seeks to remedy a clear injustice in the U.S. immigration system. Approximately 75 percent of all current legal immigrants enter the United States on the basis of family ties.16 Within this family preference system, married male- female couples effectively hold most privileged immigrant status. The significance of heterosexual marriage as a mechanism for legally immigrating is highlighted by government statistics. In 2005, the most recent year for which immigration statistics are available, the United States admitted 1,122,373 legal immigrants. Of these, 259,144 (or 23 percent) were heterosexual spouses of U.S. citizens.17 An additional 100,139 spouses and children of legal permanent residents were also admitted, though this group was subject to per-country quota limits.18 Participating in a male-female couple provides a clearly defined route for becoming a legal immigrant, which tells us something important about how sexuality structures possibilities for becoming il/legal. In contrast to male-female couples, same-sex couples are shut out from using their relationships as a basis for legal immigration. No one knows exactly how many such couples are affected. But the 2000 census, which almost certainly undercounted same-sex couples, provides one snapshot. According to the census, a total of 63,366 same-sex couples were in relationships where one or both part- ners were not U.S. citizens.19 This suggests that the issue of partner reunification for binational same-sex couples is significant.

<strong>The affidavit of support provides a mechanism for the government to manage immigrants and integrate them into the heteronormative society.</strong><br />

<br />
An example of how couple ties provide technologies for managing risks associated with legally admitted immigrants, and for attempting to transform these immigrants into good citizens, is provided by the “affidavit of support” system implemented in 1997. Under the system, those sponsoring a relative for immigration must file a legally binding affidavit of support with the immigration service, showing that their income is at least 125 percent of the federal poverty level for a family that includes themselves, the person they are sponsoring, and any other dependents. The affidavit remains in effect until the immigrant has become a citi- zen, accrues a ten-year paid employment history, permanently departs the United States, or dies. It is not voided by divorce, although in cases of abuse or battery of children or spouses, some requirements may be waived for twelve months.50 Sponsors may be required to reimburse the federal government for any benefits used by the immigrant during the period that the affidavit is in effect. Immigrants may also, in theory, sue their sponsors if the sponsor does not provide adequate support. As I have argued elsewhere, affidavits rely on a white, bourgeois logic of “heteronormativity as responsibility” to redefine the terms on which immigrants are to be not only admitted to but also incorporated within the United States.51 This works at several levels. For one, the affidavits reflect how heteronormative families are increasingly promoted by the state as a means to absorb the costs of unemploy- ment, unaffordable health care, and so on, within the broader neoliberal process of sharply reducing all social welfare entitlements, and reallocating costs to the private home.52 Second, responsibility is conceived in terms that link economic imperatives to cultural norms that are moralizing, heteropatriarchal, and racist.53 Through their sponsors’ examples, immigrants are expected to internalize and live by these norms. I need hardly mention that these are elite, U.S. government– generated cultural models that diverge from, and attempt to materially reorder, migrants’ own understandings and practices. <br />

<strong>Scenario 1 is Heteronormativity</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The state uses immigration laws to reinforce hegemonic heterosexuality- both by excluding lesbian and gay individuals and enforcing racial, gender, and class exclusions. Absent changing the framework of the immigration debate to confront these exclusions, scholars will only further hegemonic power relations. Examining the intersection of immigration and sexuality as well as race, class, and gender is crucial to truly radical politics.</strong><br />

<br />
My analysis of the interface between immigration control and identity categories was most thoroughly developed in relation to women’s sexuality, though I also indicated its application to racial, ethnic, class, and nationality categories. Entry Denied suggests that although women’s sexuality has been a central concern of federal immigration control since the late nineteenth century, immigration officials never simply “uncovered” sexual identities or proclivities that already preexisted within immigrant women. Rather, multiple practices and discourses that varied by time, location, and the individuals involved were brought to bear upon immigrant women, in ways that contributed to producing the sexual identities, acts, and norms around which immigration monitoring was organized and regularly redefined. My focus on sexuality directly challenged the tendency in immigration scholarship to ignore sexuality altogether or else subsume it into accounts of gender. Indeed, gender immigration scholarship has not substantially explored sexuality either. This may be understandable because, as Eve Sedgwick suggests, “the question of gender and the question of sexuality, inextricable from one another though they are...are...not the same question.” 3 Sedgwick’s point, that sexuality requires analysis on its own terms, needs to be acknowledged and addressed within immigration scholarship. In taking up Sedgwick’s call, immigration scholars will have to guard against the presumption of normative heterosexuality. As Michael Warner explains, “het culture thinks of itself as the elemental form of human association, as the very model of intergender relations, as the invisible basis of all community, and as the means of reproduction without which society wouldn’t exist.” 4 Entry Denied challenges both the erasure of sexuality and the presumption of normative heterosexuality in immigration scholarship, by centering sexuality while also making clear that not everyone is heterosexual. Further, it argues that far from being “natural,” hegemonic heterosexuality is anxiously manufactured and oppressively enforced by state institutions that include the immigration apparatus. Since hegemonic heterosexuality is produced through racial, ethnic, gender, and class exclusions, only certain immigrants’ heterosexuality becomes acceptable, while others are slated for exclusion— along with the rest of the “peripheral” sexual groups. These arguments make clear that sexual concerns crucially structure immigration-control processes and, as a result, cannot be simply tacked on to existing research. Rather, the theoretical frameworks and methodologies of immigration scholarship must be substantially revised to take sexuality in all its forms into critical account. Until these changes happen, immigration scholarship will not only continue to mirror but also further reinforce hegemonic power relations, while at the same time overlooking crucial aspects of how immigration processes operate. Entry Denied engages in dialogue not just with immigration but also with sexuality scholarship. Here my concern is the fact that sexuality scholarship rarely addresses immigration, despite compelling reasons to do so. For instance, immigration has profoundly transformed sexual politics, communities, and cultural production in the last quarter century, in ways that demand attention. Furthermore, both immigration and sexuality have been at the forefront of public debate and legislative intervention in that same time period. Consequently, examination of the ways that xenophobia and normative heterosexuality articulate one another is critical. Equally necessary are analyses of the ways that anxieties about immigration strengthen the ability of state apparatuses to allocate rights and opportunities in a manner that reinforces hierarchies that are gendered, racialized, and classed. 5 <br />

<strong>Institutionalized heteronormativity constantly reproduces violence and oppression on LGBT individuals.</strong><br />

<br />
These are systematic and socially accepted injuries inflicted upon individu- als outside of the heteronormative mandate. Institutional violence is widespread for LGBTQ individuals and communities. Undergirding all social institutions is heteronormative ideology (Berlant &amp; Warner, 1998; Richardson, 1996). Hege- monic heterosexuality permeates the family (VanEvery, 1996a, b), domestic and intimate life (Croghan, 1993; Holland, Ramazanoglu, &amp; Thomson, 1996; VanEvery, 1996b), education (Kumashiro, 2002; Pinar, 1998; Talburt &amp; Steinberg, 2000), social policy (Carabine, 1996; Eskridge, 2002; Kaplan, 1997), the mass media and popular culture (Fejes &amp; Petrich, 1993; Gross, 2001; Gross &amp; Woods, 1999; Ingraham, 1999), among others. In short, heteronormative thinking is deeply ingrained, and strategically invisible, in our social institutions. The process of normalization of heterosexuality in our social system actively and methodically subordinates, disempowers, denies, and rejects individuals who do not conform to the heterosexual mandate by criminalizing them, denying them protection against discrimination, refusing them basic rights and recognition, or all of the above (Kaplan, 1997; Rubin, 1984/1993). More simply stated, the regulatory power of heteronormativity denies LGBTQ individuals and couples their citizenship. There are numerous “positive rights” (Stein, 1999, p. 286) that heterosexual individuals take for granted but LGBTQ persons are categorically denied. They include being able to marry a person of the same sex, gain custody of their children, become foster and adoptive parents, visit one’s same-sex part- ner in the hospital, being able to obtain bereavement leave when one’s partner passes away, being able to file joint income tax returns with one’s partner, among many others. Although the issue of same-sex marriage is highly con- tested on ideological grounds within LGBTQ communities in the U.S. (Yep, Lovaas, &amp; Elia, 2003), LGBTQ couples are deprived of the numerous rights and privileges accorded to heterosexually married dyads (Kaplan, 1997; Stein, 1999). In sum, heteronormativity is a site of unrelenting, harsh, unforgiving, and continuous violence for LGBTQ individuals. Such violence is everywhere: in the individual psyche and in collective consciousness, in the individual per- ceptions and experiences and in the social system and institutions. <br />
<br />
<strong>Heterosexism is a form of exclusion that is used to justify the genocide of entire populations. This logic is part of a trend towards global omnicide – all violence is caused by scapegoating minorities.</strong><br />
Sedgewick in 98 &lt;Eve, Prof of English at CUNY, The Epistemology of the Closet, p. 129&gt; <br />
From at least the biblical story of Sodom and Gomorrah, scenarios of same-sex desire would seem to have had a privileged, thou by no means an exclusive, relation in Western culture to scenarios of both genocide and omnicide. That sodomy, the name by which homosexual acts are known even today to the law of half of the United States and to the Supreme Court of all of them, should already be inscribed with the name of a site of mass extermination is the appropriate trace of a double history. In the first place there is a history of the mortal suppression, legal or subjudicial, of gay acts and gay people, through burning, hounding, physical and chemical castration, concentration camps, bashing—the array of sanctioned fatalities that Louis Crompton records under the name of gay genocide, and whose supposed eugenic motive becomes only the more colorable with the emergence of a distinct, naturalized minority identity in the nineteenth century. In the second place, though, there is the inveterate topos of associating gay acts of persons with fatalities vastly broader than their own extent: if it is ambiguous whether every denizen of the obliterated Sodom was a sodomite, clearly not every Roman of the late Empire can have been so, despite Gibbon’s connecting the eclipse of the whole people to the habits of a few. Following both Gibbon and the Bible, moreover, with an impetus borrowed from Darwin, one of the few areas of agreement among modern Marxist, Nazi, and liberal capitalist ideologies is that there is a peculiarly close, though never precisely defined affinity between same-sex desire and some historical condition of moribundity, called “decadence,” to which not individuals or minorities but whole civilizations are subject. Bloodletting on a scale more massive by orders of magnitude than any gay minority presence in the culture is “cure,” if cure there be, to the mortal illness of decadence. If a fantasy trajectory, utopian in its own terms, toward gay genocide has been endemic in Western culture from its origins than it may also have been true that the trajectory toward gay genocide was never clearly distinguishable from a broader apocalyptic trajectory toward something approaching omnicide. The deadlock of the past century between minoritizing and universalizing understandings of homo/heterosexual definition can only have deepened this fatal bond in the heterosexist imaginaire. In our culture as in Billy Budd, the phobic narrative trajectory toward imagining a time after the homosexual is finally inseparable from that toward imagining a time after the human; in the wake of the homosexual the wake incessantly produced since first there were homosexuals, every human relation is pulled into its shining representational furrow. Fragments of visions of a time after the homosexual are, of course, currently in dizzying circulation in our culture. One of the many dangerous ways that AIDS discourse seems to ratify and amplify preiniscribed homophobic mythologies is in its pseudo-evolutionary presentation of male homosexuality as a stage doomed to extinction (read, a phase the species is going though) on the enormous scale of whole populations. The lineaments of openly genocidal malice behind this fantasy appear only occasionally in the respectable media, though they can be glimpsed even there behind the poker-face mask of our national experiment in laissez-faire medicine. A better, if still deodorized, whiff of that malice comes from the famous pronouncement of Pat Robertson: “AIDS is God’s way of weeding his garden.” The saccharine luster this dictum gives to its vision of devastation and the ruthless prurience with which it misattributes its own agency, cover a more fundamental contradiction: that, to rationalize complacent glee at a spectacle of what is imagined as genocide, a proto-Darwinian process of natural selection is being invoked—in the context of a Christian fundamentalism that is not only antievolutionist but recklessly oriented toward universal apocalypse. A similar phenomenon, also too terrible to be noted as mere irony, is how evenly our culture’s phobia about HIV-positive blood is kept pace with its rage for keeping that dangerous blood in broad, continuous circulation. This is evidenced in projects for universal testing, and in the needle-sharing implicit in William Buckley’s now ineradicable fantasy of tattooing HIV-positive persons. But most immediately and pervasively it is evidenced in the literal bloodbaths that seem to make the point of the AIDS related resurgence in violent bashings of gays—which, unlike the gun violence otherwise ubiquitous in this culture, are characteristically done with two-by-fours, baseball bats, and fists, in the most literal minded conceivable form of body-fluid contact. <br />

<strong>Immigration restrictions are a deliberate attempt to target LGBT immigrants as terrorist threats.</strong><br />

In the lead-up to the war in Iraq, the U.S. Department of Defense began spying on LGBT activist groups, including the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network, labeling a demonstration held by the group that included a gay &quot;kiss-in&quot; as a credible terrorist threat. n79 The Pentagon was also found to have spied on the New York University School of Law's LGBT group, the OUTLaws, labeling their actions in opposition to the &quot;Don't Ask Don't Tell&quot; military policy as &quot;possibly violent.&quot; n80 The passage of DOMA ensured that the federal government had free rein to target LGBT immigrants and their families with harsh anti-terror laws and led to the deportation, detention, and arrest of thousands of LGBT individuals and the dissolution of their families. Without the federal legal protections conferred by relationship recognition, LGBT immigrants are disadvantaged under U.S. immigration law, and the current anti-terror framework of U.S. immigration policy allows opponents of LGBT relationship recognition to exploit this lack of protection. Reacting to the 9/11 attacks, Congress implemented strict immigration policies against &quot;harboring&quot; illegal immigrants and the use of fraudulent identification documents. These efforts effectuated the dual purpose of ridding the U.S. of undesirable immigrants while simultaneously punishing LGBT individuals who sought to redefine &quot;traditional&quot; notions of family and identity. In the absence of relationship recognition LGBT immigrants are uniquely vulnerable under U.S. immigration laws that have been amended and expanded in order to protect the homeland. Although one might argue that this anti-terror campaign's effect on LGBT immigrants, waged through immigration policy reform, is simply a matter of misappropriated intent, I argue instead that the [*362] campaign is a deliberate attempt to leverage terrorism as the new ideological exclusion and LGBT immigrants as terrorists. i.

How are gender and sexuality central to the current “war on terrorism”? This question opens on to others: How are the technologies that are being developed to combat “terrorism” departures from or transformations of older technologies of heteronormativity, white supremacy, and national- ism? In what way do contemporary counterterrorism practices deploy these technologies, and how do these practices and technologies become the quotidian framework through which we are obliged to struggle, sur- vive, and resist? Sexuality is central to the creation of a certain knowledge of terrorism, specifically that branch of strategic analysis that has entered the academic mainstream as “terrorism studies.” This knowledge has a history that ties the image of the modern terrorist to a much older figure, the racial and sexual monsters of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Further, the construction of the pathologized psyche of the terrorist- monster enables the practices of normalization, which in today’s context often means an aggressive heterosexual patriotism. As opposed to initial post–September 11 reactions, which focused narrowly on “the disappearance of women,” we consider the question of gender justice and queer politics through broader frames of reference, all with multiple genealogies—indeed, as we hope to show, gender and sex- uality produce both hypervisible icons and the ghosts that haunt the machines of war. Thus, we make two related arguments: (1) that the con- struct of the terrorist relies on a knowledge of sexual perversity (failed heterosexuality, Western notions of the psyche, and a certain queer mon- strosity); and (2) that normalization invites an aggressive heterosexual patriotism that we can see, for example, in dominant media representa- tions (for example, The West Wing), and in the organizing efforts of Sikh Americans in response to September 11 (the fetish of the “turbaned” Sikh man is crucial here).1 The forms of power now being deployed in the war on terrorism in fact draw on processes of quarantining a racialized and sexualized other, even as Western norms of the civilized subject pro- vide the framework through which these very same others become sub- jects to be corrected. Our itinerary begins with an examination of Michel Foucault’s figure of monstrosity as a member of the West’s “abnormals,” followed by a consideration of the uncanny return of the monster in the discourses of “terrorism studies.” We then move to the relationship between these monstrous figures in contemporary forms of heteronorma- tive patriotism. We conclude by offering readings of the terrorism episode of The West Wing and an analysis of South Asian and Sikh American community-based organizing in response to September 11. <br />

<strong>The constant fear produced by this endless ‘war on terror’ diminishes American liberties and could results in pre-emptive biological and nuclear attacks in the name of securing the homeland.</strong><br />
Kohn in 9 &lt;Richard H. (Professor of History and Adjunct Professor of Peace, War, and Defense at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

Nearly every war in American history has involved one or more serious infringements of civil liberties and freedoms: suppression of political criticism of the government, government censorship, arrests, the intimidation and closing of newspapers; preventive detention of individuals and groups deemed a threat to security; jailings and deportations of immigrants and resident aliens; trials of civil- ians in military courts; hysteria about traitors and disloyalty; the use of the military and other government agencies to gather intelligence on citizens and organizations; even the mass incarceration of an ethnic group in the case of Japanese Americans during World War II.98 Liberty and freedom have flourished in the United States, indeed expanded over time, in part because until the mid-twentieth century, Americans sharply differentiated war and peace, and repudiated the abuse of civil liberty once the danger passed. But if the struggle against terrorism is “war” and if the threat (and its definition as “war”) last indefinitely, then the danger to civil liberty will be ongoing and any diminishing of it permanent. Historical experience and the bitter battles over detaining and interrogating suspected terrorists, wire- tapping, immigration control, and other provisions of the USA Patriot Act and its successor suggest a willingness on the part of the American people to support radi- cal infringements or even suspensions of freedoms in order to gain security against catastrophic terrorism.99 “War generates a powerful mass psychology,” concludes the legal scholar Geoffrey R. Stone in a comprehensive history of free speech in wartime. “Emotions run high. . . . ”100 Because the country remains highly vulnerable to terrorism, the greatest dan- ger lies in the reaction to future attacks, particularly ones even more shocking and destructive than those in September 2001. In the aftermath, the American people could demand a radical tilt of the balance between liberty and security that over time would become permanent. Even without another catastrophic attack, if the American people continue to think of the struggle against terrorism as war, the nation could very well move incrementally and unknowingly toward diminishing freedoms, changing imperceptibly the relationship between the individual and the state. In the event of another attack, neither Congress nor the judiciary is likely to stand in the way. One defers to the executive in war. The other, the judiciary, has rarely limited the executive in such circumstances.101 As Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson wrote in his concurring opinion to one of the few rulings to restrict a president in wartime, the Court can be “indecisive because of the judicial practice of dealing with the largest questions in the most narrow way.”102 In militarizing the threat of terrorism, the United States differs from almost every other country in the world and ignores its own historical experience, which at various times has included terrorism in many forms. Some countries today face internal terrorist threats in the form of nationalist or ethnic separatists—Russia, China, Spain, Turkey, Sri Lanka, to name a few examples. For some, like Israel, the threat is existential and connected to hostile neighbors. But many are targeted, like the United States, by radical Islam and are, because of their location or demo- graphic makeup, even more vulnerable: European, Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, and Muslim countries in Asia such as Pakistan and Indonesia. Many, of course, have much less commitment to civil liberty and personal freedom than the western democracies. But none have declared a “war on terror” or approached the struggle in apocalyptic or military terms. Britain in particular experienced a violent terrorist campaign from the Irish Republican Army for over thirty years and today labors under the same threat as the United States, but has never defined the problem as war, without undermining civil liberties or losing civic equilibrium. Until the 1940s, the United States avoided Europe’s militarization and militarism; when after 1945 Europe turned away from both to construct peaceful civic societies, the United States went in the opposite direction.103 The closest parallel to the United States may be Israel, which views the threat of terrorism as existential and has militarized to a greater extent than any other developed nation, but without forfeiting tradi- tional internal freedoms.104 Perhaps American military leaders have been the most explicit about the inter- nal danger to the United States that terrorism truly presents. “The United States may have to declare martial law someday . . . in the case of a devastating attack with weapons of mass destruction causing tens of thousands of casualties,” retired Army General Wayne A. Downing speculated at the end of 2002, some six months after leaving the White House as Deputy National Security Adviser for Combat- ing Terrorism.105 The first head of Northern Command, created in 2002 to provide military support for the defense of the American homeland, expressed a similar thought: “There may be situations if we ever got into a major chemical biological nuclear attack problem where we may, in fact, be in charge,” if “it’s become so bad that the lead federal agency in working with the state governors say[s] . . . ‘we give up’” and “then the president and the Secretary of Defense . . . decide, ‘yes, that is appropriate.’”106 In his first public interview after retiring from active duty in 2003, General Tommy Franks identified the single most dangerous possibility offered by an endless war on terrorism. An attack with weapons of mass destruction “just to create casualties . . . to terrify” could lead “the western world, the free world” to forfeit its “freedom and liberty,” to lose its democracy, and “begin to militarize our country in order to avoid a repeat of another mass-casualty event, . . . to potentially unravel the fabric of our Constitution.”107 The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs from 2001 to 2005, General Richard Myers, called “this terrorist threat . . . the biggest threat our nation has faced at least since the Civil War, perhaps ever.”108 Histo- rians would undoubtedly disagree but might conclude nevertheless that the chief danger posed to the United States is internal: what the American people might do to themselves. As Myers put it, “the biggest long-term impact is fear.”109 A half century earlier, Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson concluded exactly that. “It is easy,” he wrote, “by giving way to the passion, intolerance and suspicions of wartime, to reduce our liberties to a shadow, often in answer to exaggerated claims of security.”110 After reviewing American history on the subject, Geoffrey Stone agreed: “the United States has a long and unfortunate history of overreacting to the dangers of wartime. Again and again, Americans have allowed fear to get the better of them.”111 <br />

<strong>Constantly viewing terrorists and other issues as threats to our security is a self-fulfilling prophecy.</strong><br />

In this sense, too, the U.S. is in Israel’s shoes. Both are entrenched in the logic of the insecurity state. That logic flows from two fundamental principles: there is a mortal threat to the very existence of our nation, and our own policies play no role in generating the threat. If our nation bears no responsibility, then we are powerless to eradicate the threat. There is no hope for a truly better world, nor for ending the danger by mutual compromise with &quot;the other side.&quot; The threat is effectively eternal. The best to hope for is to hold the threat forever at bay. Yet the sense of powerlessness is oddly satisfying, because it preserves the conviction of innocence: if our policies are so ineffectual, the troubles of the world can hardly be our fault. And the vision of an endless status quo is equally satisfying, because it promises to prevent historical change. If peril is permanent, the world is an endless reservoir of potential enemies. Any fundamental change in the status quo portends only catastrophe. The only path to security, it seems, is to prevent change by imposing control over others. When those others fight back, the national insecurity state sees no reason to re-evaluate its policies; that would risk the change it seeks, above all, to avoid. So it can only meet violence with more violence, while protesting its innocence. Of course, the inevitable frustration is blamed on the enemy, reinforcing the sense of peril and the demand for absolute control through violence. The goal of total control is self-defeating; each step toward security becomes a source of, and is taken as proof of, continuing insecurity. This makes the logic of the insecurity state viciously circular. Why are we always fighting? Because we always have enemies. How do we know we always have enemies? Because we are always fighting. And knowing that we have enemies, how can we afford to stop fighting? In the insecurity state, there is no way to talk about security without voicing fears of insecurity, no way to express optimism without expressing despair. On every front, it is a self-fulfilling prophecy; a self-confirming and self-perpetuating spiral of violence; a trap that seems to offer no way out. <br />

And because these sense-events continue to be re-actualized and repeated within these narrow parameters they produce meaning-effects that are relatively fixed and sedimented in various ways. The valuations of good and evil become fixed insofar as they are given a transcendental meaning and ground in the development of Christianity which develops an elaborate theology in order to explain its various manifestations. The categories of normal and abnormal become fixed insofar as they are given an elaborate scientific meaning and ground in the development of psychiatry and criminology which develop complex rational justifications that replace the need for a transcendental foundation. But they also become fixed insofar as they are developed as multifaceted and specific answers that reduce the problematic situations from which they arise to problems, answers given categorical status and extended to encompass all future problems. The question then, is to how actualize events in a different manner or, to be more precise, establish the conditions under which a different actualization might take place. This is what Deleuze calls 'counter-actualization' (LS 151 et passim). It is an attempt to return to the virtual structure of the event to pave the way for a new actualization. The problem is that, if I have Deleuze right, we cannot isolate and individuate the virtual components of events as discrete elements since to do so is to make them present, to make them actual. That is, identifying and isolating them is to serialize them and repeat them in such as to bring them to bear on the present. A project of this sort would be an actualization of the virtual which would defeat the purpose of returning to the virtual itself. Moreover, it would reduce genealogy to history by re-introducing representation at the heart of genealogy. Such a project would presuppose that the virtual could be represented, that there are discrete, fixed events in history that contain the truth of the matter. Moreover, it seems to me that neither Nietzsche or Foucault function in this manner. Neither claims to identify the 'real' elements of our history that others have failed to perceive. Something else is at work here. That something is what Deleuze refers to as the problematic and Foucault as problematization. Deleuze contrasts the problematic with the problem. The problem is a way of reducing the problematic character of things to something which has a solution. Problems, as such, always have specific and singular solutions. &quot;A problem always gets the answer it deserves.&quot; Events, on the contrary, remain problematic; they do not have solutions or, more to the point, they do not have solutions except insofar as they are actualized. This is a function of their temporal nature as always subsisting in the infinitive form of verbs, always in a state of becoming. The problem is a reduction of this becoming to the present tense, an actualization of the virtual, infinitive structure of the event which allows for a singular solution that can be repeated without (much) difference. Here we see what Nietzsche and Foucault criticized in their respective genealogies. For Nietzsche, Christianity reduces the problematic character of will to power by reducing it to the problem of good and evil (and its attendant notions of free will and the passions). For Foucault, crime, with all its political, social and economic aspects, is reduced to the problem of delinquency, of a criminal nature that lurks in the 'souls' of men. Each problem produces an answer, whether it be eternal damnation or the prison or the answer which is common to both -- the war against the 'instincts.' What genealogy does then, the difference it makes, is that it returns to the virtual structure of the event by problematizing it, by re-actualizing it in such a way as to preclude a singular and specific solution. What marks genealogy, particularly the genealogies of Nietzsche and Foucault, is its inability to provide solutions. Neither of the two had anything to say to their readers who asked when they finished their works -- &quot;What then?&quot; Foucault especially refused to provide programs for the reform or replacement of prisons, mental institutions or an ethics of sexuality. Each sought to problematize anew problems that had supposedly been solved, problems that were only presented as problems to students by teachers who already knew the answers, problems no longer conceived of as real problems. To conclude: History, as opposed to genealogy, is the ordering of events in a single series that repeats those events within narrowly defined limits; it is for all intents and purposes the repetition of the Same. History is a narrative that reduces the problematic nature of the events it addresses to problems that have solutions; solutions that are also repetitions of the Same; solutions that re-impose or attempt to re-impose the values imbedded in a long history of errors. History is the reproduction of a social memory that reproduces the tradition and imbeds it in our psyches, our social relations and our institutions. History actualizes, materializes that tradition. Genealogy is the attempt to re-serialize events. Again, genealogy does not invent, discover or emphasize new or different events nor does it re-interpret events in order to discover hidden or sedimented meanings that have been neglected by the tradition. It is the attempt to counter-actualize the event, to return, in one form or another, to the virtual structure of the event in order to re-problematize the event. The goal is not to find a new solution, to 'fix' history, to offer a better or truer history or account of the past. The goal is to make the problem problematic, to make it a real problem once again, a problem we no longer know the answer to but for which we are compelled to find solutions. Genealogy generates a counter-memory, a memory made of the same components as the memory of history but one in which those components have been repeated and re-arranged in a different manner, re-actualized along different and multiple series. Counter-memory is a mutation of memory. Genealogy functions as a virus that mutates our collective memory to the point where we can no longer remember or recognize the tradition that is embodied in our psyches, our social relations and our institutions. As such, it forces us, or at least allows us the possibility of, re-membering and re-cognizing that tradition, of finding a way to create our own problems and our own local, specific and finite solutions. If genealogy mutates the collective memory of our society it is with the goal of mutating the material structures of that memory -- our values, discourses, practices, institutions and our selves. <br />

How would an analysis attuned to the multiplicity of these reterritorial- izations chart its effects without producing the illusion of an overall unity, a complete, finished hegemony? We believe the ongoing struggles against American empire building both here and abroad must be studied in their specificity, in the complexity of their immanence, without the comfort of dialectical synthesis or the fatalism of a domination decided before the fact. In this article, we address the historical node of xenophobic immigration, detention policies, and the counterstrategies of South Asians in the United States: the 1923 Bhagat Singh Thind case; the figure of the model minor- ity; the turban of the contemporary Sikh man as a sign of guilt—three historical moments in the incorporation and abjection of the South Asian in hegemonic racial projects in the United States. We consider the tactical node of counterterrorism discourse as it elaborates a civilizational mission that is forever sliding between the assured fixity of a (surveillance) system and the intolerable dispersion of (insurgent, dissenting, resistant, terrorist) networks.10 We consider the ongoing resistances, the productive complicities, and, yes, the pitfalls embedded in strategies of constructing and claiming “solidarity across difference.” Finally, we offer an analysis of the node that is being actively constituted today through different Western media giving rise to what we will call perverse projectiles of singular and always complicit resistances. Consequently, our itinerary in this article is fragmentary and tangential. Although we believe that each node constitutes an important site of struggle, the implications of those disparate struggles have yet to be articulated together. It might be that they never will. What we hope for through this itin- erant meandering is a collective and multiple enunciation that reverberates as much in the possibility embedded in the blockage of solidarity as in its triumphant actualization. Perhaps even an enunciation that opens the ear to those vibrations in a practice of solidarity that exceeds its actualization. We seek perhaps to experience another time, an embracing of the time of monstrosity as our present-future. <br />

<strong>The state uses the logic of survival to inflate impacts and justify its biopolitical control over the people it governs- we must examine this ideology of policy making in order to disrupt it.</strong><br />
Golob in 3 &lt;Stephanie R. is an assistant professor of political science at Baruch College, City University of New York “Beyond the Policy Frontier: Canada, Mexico, and the Ideological Origins of NAFTA” World Politics 55.3 (2003) 361-398&gt; <br />
Why are certain foreign policy options considered taboo or simply kept off the agenda as necessarily unthinkable or self-destructive? In other words, how are policy frontiers exiling these offensive options [End Page 363] developed, perpetuated, and defended over time, despite changes in both international and domestic incentives? In international relations theory, particularly as it is understood in the realist paradigm, policy continuity is a reflection of the national interest, which is viewed as the state's overriding objectives—either its bedrock survival or its power-projection imperatives. Such a minimalist and universalist view of the national interest, however, cannot account for those limitations on policy choices that serve no objective strategic purpose, but rather reflect subjective symbolic or historical understandings of the nation's sovereignty, security, and identity. In certain cases, because of political and ideological characteristics specific to a particular country perceiving a threat to its survival, an analyst cannot simply read off the national interest by drawing on neorealists' stock of material indicators (such as menacing shifts in relative capabilities) or on neoliberals' economic cost-benefit calculus for cooperation. At the same time, the concept of the national interest is not altogether useless, provided that (1) it is shifted from the smooth and automatic world of IR theory into the realm of foreign policy analysis and (2) the content of the national interest is determined not only by the abstract survival imperatives of the nation but also by those of the state, its elites, and their strategies of legitimation. This entails three interrelated arguments. First, by claiming that the content of the national interest may vary according to a given state's interpretation of its survival imperatives, I am challenging structural arguments that view the state as a generic, reactive unit within the international system whose actions result from materially driven &quot;behavior&quot; rather than self-determined &quot;policy.&quot; Second, I am arguing against a pluralist or interest-group-based model of the state, in which the state serves as a neutral arena for competition between societal groups, and foreign policy (like any other policy) is a mere output of that competitive process. Instead, I argue that the national interest is defined and shaped primarily within a relatively autonomous institutional entity called &quot;the state,&quot; which can, in fact, insulate certain policy options from societal pressure. These options can then be interpreted according to paradigms that do not necessarily correspond to the so-called imperatives of a materially driven system. Finally, I look inside the state and link the content of national interest to the legitimation needs of those who run the state, which is seen most transparently in these elites' own interpretations of what constitutes security for the nation (and for themselves). As Weber has pointed out and as Gramsci has also observed, political authority cannot [End Page 364] be maintained through coercion alone; it also depends upon persuasion or some form of ideational justification. Although modern liberal democracies rely less on coercion to retain power than do authoritarian regimes, both nonetheless rely upon rhetorical and symbolic politics to justify their authority. Furthermore, both face the possibility (to different degrees, to be sure) of losing power if they fail to fulfill their perceived obligations. Popular sovereignty, the idea that underlies and legitimates modern democratic regimes, is derived from the inherent threat of revolt if the people sense that their will is not being carried out—for example, when state actions threaten closely held values such as individual freedom or equality. Authoritarian regimes—even those with vast repressive apparatuses—maintain power over time only if they can convince a significant base of citizens that their regime best upholds the nation's values or protects its historic identity. Foreign policy, with its focus on common threats and national unity, is just the kind of policy that both types of regimes can rely upon to make a high-impact, symbolic connection to the source of their legitimacy. Officials interpret the national interest in terms of what constructivists have called a nation's &quot;shared&quot; or &quot;corporate&quot; identity; 2 they justify their own authority by equating the survival of the nation and its distinct corporate identity with the survival of their state. Their ultimate goal is to shape the definition of national interest so as to reinforce the political and emotional connection between citizens and the state through a core narrative of identity. 3 In this way, they demonstrate the state's identification with, and commitment to, the nation's highest ideals and its most treasured self-schemas. However, this selective interpretation of the national interest, particularly when it results in the elimination of certain policy options, may not always produce &quot;rational&quot; policy preferences—that is, those that prioritize material (military or economic) interests predicted by systemic or societal pressures. For example, the state may define the national interest in a way that exiles logical or lucrative options that favor private and/or foreign interests, thus resisting its own capture and enhancing its legitimacy by adding to the symbolic language of patriotism. 4 Similarly, [End Page 365] rather than making wholesale distinctions between &quot;security&quot; issues and &quot;economic&quot; or &quot;cultural&quot; issues, the state is at liberty to define which specific policy options threaten the nation as defined by the state, and can then justify this &quot;securitizing&quot; accordingly. 5 Thus, policy frontiers are often erected in issue-areas in which a material threat to national integrity or survival is objectively absent but in which the defense of the national interest is weighted with (subjective) symbolic significance. To better understand the mechanisms that limit a nation's foreign policy agenda, it is necessary to examine the historical nature of policy-making—how past decisions affect future choices. Comparative politics offers two approaches to this issue that can be fruitfully combined to offer a compelling explanatory model of both the extreme continuity implied in policy frontiers and the rupture that comes from transcending them. The literature on policy legacies provides insights into the politics within the state that supplant (and defend against) public contestation in order to limit policy options over time. Here, the state is neither a system-determined billiard ball nor a societally dominated arena. Rather, it is viewed as a relatively autonomous concert of institutions whose constituent agencies form &quot;policy legacies&quot;—political, ideational, and bureaucratic interest-based templates of acceptable and nonacceptable policy options that remain relatively stable even in the face of legislative or popular/electoral pressures. 6 Conceived as types of policy legacies, policy frontiers are constructed and perpetuated institutionally via the &quot;permanent housing&quot; of exiled options inside bureaucracies that not only are insulated from outside constituencies but also are imbued with ideologies that venerate the role of the agency in defending the policy frontier against other agencies, as well as against future chief executives seeking to change course. 7 However, the policy legacy approach, with its emphasis on continuity, does not adequately account for change. Here, a second approach to the historical nature of policy making—historical institutionalism and [End Page 366] path dependency—provides a useful metaphoric vocabulary for identifying and comparing the processes that establish and may potentially dislodge institutional and ideological barriers to policy change. 8 The first metaphor is that of the critical juncture—a destabilizing event that sends a polity from path A onto path B and that also forecloses the future availability of policy options associated with either its former path A or alternative paths C, D, and E. The shift to path B is not the random start of a process of blind or automatic perpetuation of practice often associated with a path-dependent view of institutions; it is a moment of state relegitimation. The discontinuity itself must be incorporated into the core narrative of national identity—either as a heroic moment or a shared national trauma—and institutions and ideology must then be reoriented to equate the state's new defense of limits on the policy agenda with the defense of the nation writ large. Next, a second metaphor—that of mechanisms of reproduction—can account for the feedback processes that perpetuate the limits on an exiled policy option. For example, the quarantine of the option to a relatively insulated and privileged bureaucracy would represent a key institutional mechanism of reproduction of policy frontiers. In turn, this institutional mechanism would be reinforced ideologically both inside the state through that institution's internal philosophy and outside through official rhetoric, public education, and, in some cases, propaganda. Most notably, these metaphors can also adapt to both change and continuity. It seems plausible that new critical junctures could destabilize the mechanisms of reproduction, thereby opening the way for a reevaluation of options previously exiled by the policy frontier. It is only in retrospect, however, that critical junctures may appear to &quot;cause&quot; policy change singlehandedly, and even then, appearances can be deceiving. Over time, the feedback effects of the mechanisms of reproduction render policy frontiers self-perpetuating and resistant to crisis and uncertainty; therefore, some potential critical junctures have been incapable of shifting the path. Instead, critical junctures are more appropriately regarded as necessary but not sufficient as causal factors: they trigger processes of politics within the state that can potentially transform or undermine the institutions that defend policy frontiers and the ideological messages that support them. At the same time, not all critical junctures are created equal; those that combine a material shock with a damaging blow to state legitimacy are the most critical and potentially destabilizing examples. In this context of state insecurity, the insulation and [End Page 367] privileging of home institutions is liable to be compromised and the search for new solutions and for new narratives of national destiny greatly intensifies. It is thus the interaction of the critical juncture with the mechanisms of reproduction—the form and the content of the policy frontier—that offers the greatest possibility of change. <br />

More specifically, where there is a policy problematic there is expertise, and where there is expertise there, too, a policy problematic will emerge. Such problematics are detailed and elaborated in terms of discrete forms of knowledge as well as interlocking policy domains. Policy domains reify the problematization of life in certain ways by turning these epistemically and politically contestable orderings of life into “problems” that require the continuous attention of policy science and the continuous resolutions of policymakers. Policy “actors” develop and compete on the basis of the expertise that grows up around such problems or clusters of problems and their client populations. Here, too, we may also discover what might be called “epistemic entrepreneurs.” Albeit the market for discourse is prescribed and policed in ways that Foucault indicated, bidding to formulate novel problematizations they seek to “sell” these, or otherwise have them officially adopted. In principle, there is no limit to the ways in which the management of population may be problematized. All aspects of human conduct, any encounter with life, is problematizable. Any problematization is capable of becoming a policy problem. Governmentality thereby creates a market for policy, for science and for policy science, in which problematizations go looking for policy sponsors while policy sponsors fiercely compete on behalf of their favored problematizations. Reproblematization of problems is constrained by the institutional and ideological investments surrounding accepted “problems,” and by the sheer difficulty of challenging the inescapable ontological and epistemological assumptions that go into their very formation. There is nothing so fiercely contested as an epistemological or ontological assumption. And there is nothing so fiercely ridiculed as the suggestion that the real problem with problematizations exists precisely at the level of such assumptions. Such “paralysis of analysis” is precisely what policymakers seek to avoid since they are compelled constantly to respond to circumstances over which they ordinarily have in fact both more and less control than they proclaim. What they do not have is precisely the control that they want. Yet serial policy failure—the fate and the fuel of all policy—compels them into a continuous search for the new analysis that will extract them from the aporias in which they constantly find themselves enmeshed.[35] Serial policy failure is no simple shortcoming that science and policy—and policy science—will ultimately overcome. Serial policy failure is rooted in the ontological and epistemological assumptions that fashion the ways in which global governance encounters and problematizes life as a process of emergence through fitness landscapes that constantly adaptive and changing ensembles have continuously to negotiate. As a particular kind of intervention into life, global governance promotes the very changes and unintended outcomes that it then serially reproblematizes in terms of policy failure. Thus, global liberal governance is not a linear problem-solving process committed to the resolution of objective policy problems simply by bringing better information and knowledge to bear upon them. A nonlinear economy of power/knowledge, it deliberately installs socially specific and radically inequitable distributions of wealth, opportunity, and mortal danger both locally and globally through the very detailed ways in which life is variously (policy) problematized by it. In consequence, thinking and acting politically is displaced by the institutional and epistemic rivalries that infuse its power/ knowledge networks, and by the local conditions of application that govern the introduction of their policies. These now threaten to exhaust what “politics,” locally as well as globally, is about.[36] It is here that the “emergence” characteristic of governance begins to make its appearance. For it is increasingly recognized that there are no definitive policy solutions to objective, neat, discrete policy problems. The “subjects” of policy increasingly also become a matter of definition as well, since the concept population does not have a stable referent eitherand has itself also evolved in biophilosophical and biomolecular as well as Foucauldian “biopower” ways <br />

The current discrimination against lesbian and gay individuals in the immigration system is grounded in a long history of exclusion. Immigration restrictions have been constructed by the government to exclude individuals on an economic, racial, geopolitical, and sexual basis. Examining the historical transformation of immigration provides us with a lens through which to formulate a struggle against this discrimination.<br />

<span class="underline">In the 1950s, anxiety gripped American society over the sudden suspicion of homosexuals in its midst——and the sexual hysteria moved in tandem with a new ““red scare.”” Homosexuals were seen as susceptible to blackmail, easy to enlist in treason</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Moreover, to the McCarthyite mind, </span><span class="underline">they shared with Communists the qualities of being gregarious yet secretive, concealing their true selves and loyalties</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, creating coteries and collectives that evaded surveillance. Republican Senate leader Kenneth Wherry said, ““</span><span class="underline">You can’’t hardly separate homosexuals from subversives. …… A man of low morality is a menace in the government, and they are all tied up together</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.””48 </span><u>The panic</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">prompted a campaign to drive homosexuals out of government service, as well as burgeoning and sometimes brutal FBI and police witch-hunts against ordinary people.49 And </span><span class="underline">it saw lesbian and gay immigrants banned from the U.S. by law</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="underline">The bar dates from the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), pushed through by </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Senator Pat McCarran of Nevada, </span><span class="underline">a livid anti-Communist crusader.

Slightly distancing itself from the whites-only past, it reinstated a trickle of Asian immigrants for the first time since 1924 (partly to improve the U.S.’’s image as the Cold War militarized the Pacific); but it held to a lopsided bias for northern European groups. By building into national quotas favorable treatment for immigrants with special skills, and for relatives of people already in the U.S., it laid the groundwork for the employment-based and family-sponsored preference categories of today.50 However, the act also allowed the government to ban people from the country on ideological grounds.51 Moreover, </span><span class="underline">it barred ““aliens afflicted with psychopathic personality, epilepsy or mental defect.””52 Congress made clear that this was meant to exclude ““homosexuals and sex perverts,””</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> even seeking an opinion from the U.S. Public Health Service that the term was broad enough to do so.53 </span><span class="underline">In 1965, the INA was amended, with new language prohibiting the entry of persons ““afflicted with …… sexual deviation.””</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">54 With slight variations in the phrasing, </span><span class="underline">for almost forty years the U.S. banned lesbians and gays from entering the country. </span><br />

<span class="underline">During the twentieth century</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, family preferences changed shape some- what. One of the most significant overhauls occurred </span><span class="underline">in 1965</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, when </span><span class="underline">explicit racial and ethnic preferences were dropped from the law</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">; </span><span class="underline">the preference system was altered to ensure that approximately 75 percent of all immigration slots would be allocated on the basis of family ties</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and family was expanded to include not just the spouses, minor children, and parents of citizens or residents, but also their adult siblings. Nonetheless, as David Reimers has shown, in elevating family preferences to become the major mechanism for legal entry, </span><span class="underline">Congress calculated that this would enable continued European dominance of the immigration stream, albeit through deniable means</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.33 </span><span class="underline">Family</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, in short, </span><span class="underline">was intended to maintain a white racial order</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="underline">It was also intended to maintain patriarchy and heteronormativity</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">; this latter is evident </span><span class="underline">from the fact that the preference for family was paralleled by a renewed exclusion of immigrant lesbians and gay men, this time under the category of sexual deviates</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Since legislators projected that only fathers would work for pay, while mothers and children would be consumers, </span><span class="underline">family was also expected to serve a particular economic function</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Admittedly, congressional racial calculations turned out to be inaccurate, as Asian and Latin American migrants came to dominate the flows of family preference immigrants, and migrant families came to include multiple earners. </span><br />

It </span><span class="underline">declared that no state was obliged to recognize ““a relationship between persons of the same sex that is treated as marriage””</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> by any other state or jurisdiction. </span><span class="underline">And it defined marriage, for all purposes of the federal government, as ““only a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife.”” The word ““spouse”” now refers ““only to a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or wife.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">””70 </span><span class="underline">This foreclosed the possibility that foreign, permanent same-sex partners of U.S. citizens could be recognized as ““spouses”” under current U.S. immigration law. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The constitutionality of DOMA remains uncertain.71 As a panicked reaction to the mere prospect of a state recognizing same-sex relationships, however, it was telling——and foretelling. Since then, nineteen states have approved constitutional amendments barring equality in civil marriage.72 Some prohibited giving any legal status to relationships other than heterosexual marriage. The results are devastating. Ohio’’s draconian amendment, for instance, forced a judge in 2005 to void part of the state’’s domestic violence law. He threw out a felony charge against a man accused of abusing his unmarried heterosexual partner——because the state constitution now barred any law or ruling that would ““create or recognize a legal status for relationships of unmarried individuals.””73</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The campaign to have same-sex relationships recognized as a basis for legal immigration seeks to remedy a clear injustice in the U.S. immigration system. Approximately 75 percent of all current legal immigrants enter the United States on the basis of family ties.16 Within this family preference system, married male- female couples effectively hold most privileged immigrant status. </span><span class="underline">The significance of heterosexual marriage as a mechanism for legally immigrating is highlighted by government statistics</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In 2005, the most recent year for which immigration statistics are available, the United States admitted 1,122,373 legal immigrants. Of these, 259,144 (or 23 percent) were heterosexual spouses of U.S. citizens.17 An additional 100,139 spouses and children of legal permanent residents were also admitted, though this group was subject to per-country quota limits.18 </span><span class="underline">Participating in a male-female couple provides a clearly defined route for becoming a legal immigrant, which tells us something important about how sexuality structures possibilities for becoming il/legal</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In contrast to male-female couples, </span><span class="underline">same-sex couples are shut out from using their relationships as a basis for legal immigration</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. No one knows exactly how many such couples are affected. But </span><span class="underline">the 2000 census, which almost certainly undercounted same-sex couples, provides</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> one snapshot. According to the census, </span><span class="underline">a total of 63,366 same-sex couples were in relationships where one or both part- ners were not U.S. citizens</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.19 This suggests that </span><span class="underline">the issue of partner reunification for binational same-sex couples is significant</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Nineteen countries have already made provisions for same-sex couples’ immigration, using diverse mechanisms.20 The United States has not.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Drawing on these analytic tools, queer migration scholarship often engages in a double movement. On the one hand, scholars have contributed to understand- ing the experiences of migrants who identify, or become identified by others, as LGBTQ (or, as </span><br />
<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">discussed by the authors in this volume, tomboys, queens, matis, malungos, novios, and amigos, among others).7 Thus </span><span class="underline">queer migration scholarship insists on recovering, theorizing, and valorizing histories and subjects that have been largely rendered invisible, unintelligible, and unspeakable in both queer and migration studies, and that reflect both “alienation from white gay communities” and “histories of multiple diasporas” forged through colonialism and capitalism</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.8 On the other hand, much of the scholarship also makes clear that “queer migrants” in many ways comprise “impossible subjects” with unrepresentable histories that exceed existing categories.9 </span><span class="underline">This leads scholars to foreground and challenge regimes of power and knowledge that generate structures of impossibility where particular groups are concerned</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and to examine how individuals negotiate them.</span> <span class="underline">Lessons drawn from analyzing power, knowledge, and identity include the importance of refusing to treat queer migrants as discretely bounded groups to merely “add on” to existing sexuality or migration scholarship</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Instead, schol- ars insist, </span><span class="underline">sexuality scholarship must rethink the role of migration</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (including as it connects with transnational capitalism and neo-imperialism) </span><span class="underline">in constructing sexual identities, communities, politics, and practices</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Equally, </span><span class="underline">migration schol- arship must analyze how sexuality structures all migration processes and expe- riences—and how migration regimes and settlement policies contribute to pro- ducing not only those who become variously defined as “queer,” “deviant,” or “abnormal” but also those who become defined as normative or “normal” within a binary structure intimately tied to racial, gender, class, cultural, and other hierar- chies</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.10 </span><span class="underline">Queer migration scholarship thus highlights the fact that normative sexu- alities</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (not just those who are deemed deviant) </span><span class="underline">require historicization</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, are produced within relations of power, and change, including through migration.11 The produc- tion of the valorized norm, however, is intimately tied to the abjection of queers and queerness. </span></span><br />
<br />
The intersection of immigration and sexuality has been largely ignored in scholarship- but it is a critical point for examining all power relations. The heteronormative practices of immigration policies marginalize those with differing sexual orientations. <br />

This occlusion becomes clear when we turn to the writings on gender and immigration. On the one hand, these writings offer valuable tools for thinking about sexuality and immigration; on the other, they show how gender-centered analyses often reinscribe heteronormativity, thus affirming Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick’s con- tention that “the question of gender and the question of sexuality, inextricable from one another though they are in that each can be expressed only in terms of the other, are nonetheless not the same question.”1 Pierrette Hondagneu-Sotelo has suggested recently that gender has not been treated seriously in mainstream immigration scholarship. Even after thirty years of feminist research, “gender is scarcely recognized or understood as having anything to do with relations of power. To the extent that gender is understood at all, it is seen within a framework of traditional sex roles.”2 Similarly, </span><span class="underline">the study of sexuality and immigration remains marginalized, trivialized, depoliticized, or treated with hostility</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.3 Part of the problem is that sexuality continues to be viewed by many immigration scholars as “natural” and “private.” Sexuality scholars, of course, have convincingly established that sexu- ality is neither an unmediated “natural” drive nor a private matter; on the con- trary, </span><span class="underline">the state and powerful social groups intervene into and deploy sexuality in normative ways</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Moreover, </span><span class="underline">these interventions “have correlated strongly with other forms of social regulation</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, especially those related to race, class, and gender.”4 Consequently, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Foucault characterizes sexuality as “an especially dense transfer point for relations of power.”</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">5 But these understandings have yet to work their way into immigration scholarship. </span><span class="underline">In the instances when sexuality is addressed in immigration scholarship, it is generally conflated with gender, which in turn is often conflated with women—a triple erasure meaning that only women have sex- uality, sexuality is gender, and gender or sexuality is normatively heterosexual.</span><br />

The state uses immigration laws to reinforce hegemonic heterosexuality- both by excluding lesbian and gay individuals and enforcing racial, gender, and class exclusions. Absent changing the framework of the immigration debate to confront these exclusions, scholars will only further hegemonic power relations. Examining the intersection of immigration and sexuality as well as race, class, and gender is crucial to truly radical politics.<br />
<strong>Luibheid in 2</strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">&lt;Eithne (Ph.D. in Ethnic Studies from the University of California, Berkeley, associate professor of ethnic studies at Bowling Green State University) <em>Entry Denied: Controlling Sexuality at the Border</em> p. 138-139&gt; </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">My analysis of the interface between immigration control and identity categories was most thoroughly developed in relation to women’s sexuality, though I also indicated its application to racial, ethnic, class, and nationality categories. Entry Denied suggests that although women’s sexuality has been a central concern of federal immigration control since the late nineteenth century, immigration officials never simply “uncovered” sexual identities or proclivities that already preexisted within immigrant women. Rather, </span><span class="underline">multiple practices and discourses that varied by time, location, and the individuals involved were brought to bear upon immigrant women, in ways that contributed to producing the sexual identities, acts, and norms around which immigration monitoring was organized and regularly redefined</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="underline">My focus on sexuality directly challenged the tendency in immigration scholarship to ignore sexuality altogether</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> or else subsume it into accounts of gender. Indeed, gender immigration scholarship has not substantially explored sexuality either. This may be understandable because, as Eve Sedgwick suggests, “the question of gender and the question of sexuality, inextricable from one another though they are...are...not the same question.” 3 Sedgwick’s point, that sexuality requires analysis on its own terms, needs to be acknowledged and addressed within immigration scholarship. In taking up Sedgwick’s call, </span><span class="underline">immigration scholars will have to guard against the presumption of normative heterosexuality</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. As Michael Warner explains, “het culture thinks of itself as the elemental form of human association, as the very model of intergender relations, as the invisible basis of all community, and as the means of reproduction without which society wouldn’t exist.” 4 </span><span class="underline">Entry Denied challenges both the erasure of sexuality and the presumption of normative heterosexuality in immigration scholarship, by centering sexuality while also making clear that not everyone is heterosexual.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Further, it argues that </span><span class="underline">far from being “natural,” hegemonic heterosexuality is anxiously manufactured and oppressively enforced by state institutions that include the immigration apparatus</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="underline">Since hegemonic heterosexuality is produced through racial, ethnic, gender, and class exclusions, only certain immigrants’ heterosexuality becomes acceptable, while others are slated for exclusion— along with the rest of the “peripheral” sexual groups</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. These arguments make clear that </span><span class="underline">sexual concerns crucially structure immigration-control processes</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and, as a result, cannot be simply tacked on to existing research. Rather, </span><span class="underline">the theoretical frameworks and methodologies of immigration scholarship must be substantially revised to take sexuality in all its forms into critical account</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="underline">Until these changes happen, immigration scholarship will not only continue to mirror but also further reinforce hegemonic power relations, while at the same time overlooking crucial aspects of how immigration processes operate</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Entry Denied engages in dialogue not just with immigration but also with sexuality scholarship. Here my concern is the fact that sexuality scholarship rarely addresses immigration, despite compelling reasons to do so. For instance, immigration has profoundly transformed sexual politics, communities, and cultural production in the last quarter century, in ways that demand attention. Furthermore, both immigration and sexuality have been at the forefront of public debate and legislative intervention in that same time period. Consequently, </span><span class="underline">examination of the ways that xenophobia and normative heterosexuality articulate one another is critical. Equally necessary are analyses of the ways that anxieties about immigration strengthen the ability of state apparatuses to allocate rights and opportunities in a manner that reinforces hierarchies that are gendered, racialized, and classed. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">5 </span><br />

The heteronormative practices of the state don’t only affect LGBT individuals, but any person of a different race, gender, or class that does not fit into the heternormative ideal or potentially challenges the power hierarchies of the heteropatriarchal state.<br />

<br />
<span class="underline">The concept of heteronormativity provides a means to conceptualize how multiple, crosscutting variables have shaped possibilities for family- and couple-based immigration</span>. <span class="underline">Heteronormativity refers to a range of normalizing discourses and practices that seek to cultivate and privilege a heterosexual population</span> while none- theless insisting that heterosexuality is “natural” and timeless rather than a prod- uct of economy, society, culture, and political struggle.27 <span class="underline">The concept of heteronormativity highlights the unjust consequences of the homo-hetero binary — but also addresses how racial, gender, class, and geopolitical hierarchies constitutively interconnect with normative heterosexuality to produce a range of subalternized social groups and unvalued family forms</span>.28 Thus, in the United States, <span class="underline">nonhetero- normative figures include not only lesbians, gay men, bisexuals, and transgen- der people from diverse backgrounds but also sex workers, poor mothers of color, people in “interracial” relationships, unmarried male migrant laborers, and others who reflect the contradictions of and potential challenges to dominant relations of neo-imperialism, racism, capitalism, and heteropatriarchy. Historically, U.S. immigration control did not merely seek to contain these threatening figures; rather, it served as a crucial mechanism for constructing, enforcing, and normalizing dominant forms of heteronormativity while producing these figures as supposed threats. Changing family preferences in immigration law reflect these developments. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">In the lead-up to the war in Iraq, the U.S. Department of Defense began spying on LGBT activist groups, including the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network, labeling a demonstration held by the group that included a gay &quot;kiss-in&quot; as a credible terrorist threat. n79 The Pentagon was also found to have spied on the New York University School of Law's LGBT group, the OUTLaws, labeling their actions in opposition to the &quot;Don't Ask Don't Tell&quot; military policy as &quot;possibly violent.&quot; n80 The passage of DOMA ensured that</span><span class="underline"> the federal government had free rein to target LGBT immigrants and their families with harsh anti-terror laws and led to the deportation, detention, and arrest of thousands of LGBT individuals and the dissolution of their families</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.

Institutionalized heteronormativity constantly reproduces violence and oppression on LGBT individuals.<br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">These are systematic and socially accepted injuries inflicted upon individu- als outside of the heteronormative mandate. </span><span class="underline">Institutional violence is widespread for LGBTQ individuals and communities</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Undergirding all social institutions is heteronormative ideology (Berlant &amp; Warner, 1998; Richardson, 1996). Hege- monic heterosexuality permeates the family (VanEvery, 1996a, b), domestic and intimate life (Croghan, 1993; Holland, Ramazanoglu, &amp; Thomson, 1996; VanEvery, 1996b), education (Kumashiro, 2002; Pinar, 1998; Talburt &amp; Steinberg, 2000), social policy (Carabine, 1996; Eskridge, 2002; Kaplan, 1997), the mass media and popular culture (Fejes &amp; Petrich, 1993; Gross, 2001; Gross &amp; Woods, 1999; Ingraham, 1999), among others. In short, </span><span class="underline">heteronormative thinking is deeply ingrained, and strategically invisible, in our social institutions. The process of normalization of heterosexuality in our social system actively and methodically subordinates, disempowers</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, denies, </span><span class="underline">and rejects individuals who do not conform to the heterosexual mandate by criminalizing them, denying them protection against discrimination, refusing them basic rights </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">and recognition, or all of the above (Kaplan, 1997; Rubin, 1984/1993). More simply stated, </span><span class="underline">the regulatory power of heteronormativity denies LGBTQ individuals and couples their citizenship. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">There are numerous “positive rights” (Stein, 1999, p. 286) that heterosexual individuals take for granted but LGBTQ persons are categorically denied. They include being able to marry a person of the same sex, gain custody of their children, become foster and adoptive parents, visit one’s same-sex part- ner in the hospital, being able to obtain bereavement leave when one’s partner passes away, being able to file joint income tax returns with one’s partner, among many others. Although the issue of same-sex marriage is highly con- tested on ideological grounds within LGBTQ communities in the U.S. (Yep, Lovaas, &amp; Elia, 2003), LGBTQ couples are deprived of the numerous rights and privileges accorded to heterosexually married dyads (Kaplan, 1997; Stein, 1999). In sum, </span><span class="underline">heteronormativity is a site of unrelenting, harsh, unforgiving, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">and continuous violence for LGBTQ individuals</span></span><span class="underline">. Such violence is everywhere: in the individual psyche and in collective consciousness, in the individual per- ceptions and experiences and in the social system and institutions. </span><br />
<br />
Heterosexism is a form of exclusion that is used to justify the genocide of entire populations. This logic is part of a trend towards global omnicide – all violence is caused by scapegoating minorities. <br />
<span class="cite">Sedgewick in 98 </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">&lt;Eve, Prof of English at CUNY, The Epistemology of the Closet, p. 129&gt;From at least the biblical story of Sodom and Gomorrah, </span>scenarios of same-sex desire <span style="font-size: 8pt;">would seem to</span> have had a privileged<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, thou by no means an exclusive,</span> relation <span style="font-size: 8pt;">in Western culture</span> to scenarios of both genocide and omnicide. That sodomy, the name by which homosexual acts are known even today to the law of half of the United States and to the Supreme Court of all of them, should already be inscribed with the name of a site of mass extermination is the appropriate trace of a double history. In the first place there is a history of the mortal suppression, legal or subjudicial, of gay acts and gay people, through burning, hounding, physical and chemical castration, concentration camps, bashin<span style="font-size: 8pt;">g—the array of sanctioned fatalities that Louis Crompton records under the name of gay genocide, and whose supposed eugenic motive becomes only the more colorable with the emergence of a distinct, naturalized minority identity in the nineteenth century. In the second place, though,</span> there is the inveterate topos of associating gay acts of persons with fatalities vastly broader than their own extent: if it is ambiguous whether every denizen of the obliterated Sodom was a sodomite, clearly not every Roman of the late Empire can have been so<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, despite Gibbon’s connecting the eclipse of the whole people to the habits of a few. Following both Gibbon and the Bible, moreover, with an impetus borrowed from Darwin, </span>one of the few areas of agreement among modern Marxist, Nazi, and liberal capitalist ideologies is that there is a peculiarly close, though never precisely defined affinity between same-sex desire and some historical condition of moribundity, called “decadence,” to which not individuals or minorities but whole civilizations are subject. Bloodletting on a scale more massive by orders of magnitude than any gay minority presence in the culture is “cure,” if cure there be, to the mortal illness of decadence. If a fantasy trajectory,<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> utopian in its own terms</span>, toward gay genocide has been endemic in Western culture from its origins than it may also have been true that the trajectory toward gay genocide was never clearly distinguishable from a broader apocalyptic trajectory toward something approaching omnicide. The deadlock of the past century between minoritizing and universalizing understandings of homo/heterosexual definition can only have deepened this fatal bond in the heterosexist <em>imaginaire</em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In our culture as in <em>Billy Budd</em>, the phobic narrative trajectory toward imagining a time <em>after the homosexual</em> is finally inseparable from that toward imagining a time <em>after the human</em>; in the wake of the homosexual the wake incessantly produced since first there <em>were</em> homosexuals, every human relation is pulled into its shining representational furrow. </span>Fragments of visions of a time <em>after the homosexual</em> are, of course, currently in dizzying circulation in our culture. One of the many dangerous ways that AIDS discourse seems to ratify and amplify preiniscribed homophobic mythologies is in its pseudo-evolutionary presentation of male homosexuality as a stage doomed to extinction<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (read, a phase the species is going though) </span>on the enormous scale of whole populations. The lineaments of openly genocidal malice behind this fantasy appear only occasionally in the respectable media, though they can be glimpsed even there behind the poker-face mask of our national experiment in laissez-faire medicin<span style="font-size: 8pt;">e</span>. A better, if still deodorized, whiff of that malice comes from the famous pronouncement of Pat Robertson: “AIDS is God’s way of weeding his garden<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.” The saccharine luster this dictum gives to its vision of devastation and the ruthless prurience with which it misattributes its own agency, cover a more fundamental contradiction: that</span>, to rationalize complacent glee at a spectacle of what is imagined as genocide, a proto-Darwinian process of natural selection is being invoked—in the context of a Christian fundamentalism that is not only antievolutionist but recklessly oriented toward universal apocalypse. A similar phenomenon, also too terrible to be noted as mere irony, is how evenly our culture’s phobia about HIV-positive blood is kept pace with its rage for keeping that dangerous blood in broad, continuous circulation<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. This is evidenced in projects for universal testing, and in the needle-sharing implicit in William Buckley’s now ineradicable fantasy of tattooing HIV-positive persons. But </span>most immediately and pervasively it is evidenced in the literal bloodbaths that seem to make the point of the AIDS related resurgence in violent bashings of gays<span style="font-size: 8pt;">—which, unlike the gun violence otherwise ubiquitous in this culture, are characteristically done with two-by-fours, baseball bats, and fists, in the most literal minded conceivable form of body-fluid contact. </span><br />
<br />
Heteronormativity is the invisible center of our society- other sexualities and people are examined through this lens of knowledge and power, leading to the marginalization and disempowerment of the Other- we must address this normalization in order to challenge it.<br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">In this passage, Simmons vividly describes </span><span class="underline">the devastating pervasiveness of hatred and violence </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">in her daily life </span><span class="underline">based on being </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">seen, perceived, </span><span class="underline">labeled, and treated as an “Other.” This process of othering creates individuals, groups, and communities that are deemed to be less important</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, less worthwhile, less consequential, less authorized, </span><span class="underline">and less human based on historically situated markers of social formation </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">such as race, class, gender, sexuality, ability, and nationality. </span><span class="underline">Othering and marginalization are results of an “invisible center” </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Ferguson, 1990, p. 3). </span><span class="underline">The </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">authority, position, and </span><span class="underline">power of such a center are attained through normalization in an ongoing circular movement. Normaliza- tion is the process of constructing</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, establishing, producing, </span><span class="underline">and reproducing a </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">taken-for-granted and </span><span class="underline">all-encompassing standard used to measure </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">goodness, </span><span class="underline">desirability</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, morality, rationality, </span><span class="underline">superiority, and </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">a host of other </span><span class="underline">dominant cul- tural values</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. As such, </span><span class="underline">normalization becomes one of the primary instruments of power in modern society </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Foucault, 1978/1990). </span><span class="underline">Normalization is a </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">symboli- cally, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">discursively</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, psychically, psychologically, </span><span class="underline">and materially violent form of social regulation and control</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, or as Warner (1993) more simply puts it, </span><span class="underline">normal- ization is “the site of violence” </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(p. xxvi). Perhaps </span><span class="underline">one of the most powerful forms of normalization in Western social systems is heteronormativity</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="underline">Through heteronormative discourses</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, abject and abominable bodies, souls, </span><span class="underline">persons</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and life forms </span><span class="underline">are created, examined, and disciplined through current regimes of knowl- edge and power </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Foucault, 1978/1990). </span><span class="underline">Heteronormativity, as the invisible center </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">and the presumed bedrock of society, </span><span class="underline">is the quintessential force </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">creating, sustain- ing, and </span><span class="underline">perpetuating the erasure, marginalization, disempowerment, and op- pression of sexual others. </span><br />

Sexuality is given meaning by the way it is used in society and communication- we are accountable for our discourse and the way it enforces or deconstructs the current heterosexual norms. This round gives us the tools to challenge and re-shape the current notions of the homo/heterosexual binary and question its productions of knowledge and power relations.<br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Disenchanted by the current social system and influenced by poststructuralism and deconstruction, </span><span class="underline">queer</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">/quare </span><span class="underline">theorists emerged </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">in the academy </span><span class="underline">as a perspective to examine the sexual by focusing on the greater sexual landscape and the heteronormative regime </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Turner, 2000). </span><span class="underline">Queer</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">/quare </span><span class="underline">theorists are driven by a deconstructive impulse </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">and queer politics presupposes, in Seidman’’s (2001) terms, a ““communicative sexual ethic”” (p. 358). Contrary to a normalizing ethic, which assumes that sex acts have inherent moral significance and that sexual desires can be classified as either good or bad by virtue of their intrinsic qualities, </span><span class="underline">a communicative ethic asserts that sex acts are given moral meaning by their communication context</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In other words, </span><span class="underline">the communicative ethic</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, as proposed by these theorists and activists, </span><span class="underline">shifts moral judgements about the character of sexual desires and acts to the qualities of the social exchange and communication encounter</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, such as mutual consent, responsibility, respect, and reciprocity. I argue that these two seemingly opposing impulses––constructive and deconstructive––should, and must, exist in an ongoing productive tension. This way </span><span class="underline">researchers focusing on sexuality are accountable for their knowledge production practices</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, as lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender voices, histo- ries, </span><span class="underline">and subjectivities are reclaimed in their own right without being complicit to the normalization of the current sexual regime</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="underline">Communication scholars</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, like researchers in other areas of academic study, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">are</span></span> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">profoundly involved and </span><span class="underline">deeply implicated in current systems of power as they produce and disseminate knowledge</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In his power/knowledge matrix, Foucault reminds us that </span><span class="underline">knowledge and truth are closely interconnected</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. He writes, </span><span class="underline">Each society has its regime of truth</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, its ““general politics”” of truth: that is, </span><span class="underline">the types of discourse which it accepts and makes function as true</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">; </span><span class="underline">the mechanisms and instances which enable one to distinguish true and false statements</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, the means by which each is sanctioned; the techniques and procedures accorded value in the acquisition of truth; </span><span class="underline">the status of those who are charged with saying what counts as true</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. (Foucault, 1980, p. 131) In other words, communication scholars are inextricably involved in current regimes of power and knowledge. As such, </span><span class="underline">communication scholars are pro- foundly implicated in the maintenance of the homo/heterosexual binary</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span><span class="underline">the fundamental conceptual pair that organizes modern Western discourses of sex- uality</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In the academy and elsewhere, </span><span class="underline">institutional heterosexuality, through the process of normalization, becomes heteronormative. Heteronormativity </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">produces ““the equation ‘‘heterosexual experience = human experience’’”” and ““</span><span class="underline">renders all other forms of human sexual expression pathological, deviant, in- visible</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, unintelligible, or written out of existence”” (Yep, 2002, p. 167). More simply put, </span><span class="underline">heteronormativity is violent and harmful to a range of people across the spectrum of sexualities,</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> including those who live within its borders. </span><span class="underline">Aware of the mobility of power relations, queer</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">/quare </span><span class="underline">theorists </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">from a vari- ety of disciplines </span><span class="underline">have provided analytical tools to create new openings and possibilities of change and transformation</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Such </span><em><span style="font-size: 11pt;">scholars are not interested in speaking for others, providing definitive solutions</span></em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, proclaiming transhistorical generalizations, declaring transcultural knowledge, or making universal pro- nouncements. These queer/quare theorists and </span><span class="underline">activists are invested in </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">““</span><span class="underline">de- taching the power of truth from the forms of hegemony</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, social, economic and cultural, </span><span class="underline">within which it operates at the present time</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">”” (Foucault, 1980, p. 133). Committed to the celebration of human differences and </span><span class="underline">dedicated to the inter- rogation of the normalizing technologies of power</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span><span class="underline">these interdisciplinary scholars and community activists scrutinize the homo/heterosexual binary as the foundation of current discourses of sexuality, and critically examine heteronormativity</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. As a communication teacher and scholar who travels across academic disciplinary boundaries, I invite communication scholars across the spectrum of social locations to join these theorists and practitioners in this radical project to expand, stretch, reorient, and re-map the conceptual landscape of the field of communication. I urge communication teachers and scholars to interrogate and unpack the homo/heterosexual binary, disentangle and demystify the power of heteronormativity in our scholarship, pedagogy, and cultural politics, and to create and produce historically specific and em- bodied racialized knowledges of the human sexual subject</span>.<br />

Our discursive questioning is key to reshape the state’s regulation of sexuality and immigration- we must question the discourses of the state in order to break down its oppressive regime.<br />
<strong>Luibheid in 2</strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">&lt;Eithne (Ph.D. in Ethnic Studies from the University of California, Berkeley, associate professor of ethnic studies at Bowling Green State University) <em>Entry Denied: Controlling Sexuality at the Border</em> p. 144-145&gt; </span><br />
<span class="underline">We also need to examine how public discourses on sexuality legitimate the exclusion, condemnation, or acceptance of particular migrants, and how these discourses become appropriated, transformed, and redeployed. We need to inquire how U.S. constructions of citizenship reproduce sexual norms that affect migrants, and reciprocally, how discourses about dangerous migrant sexualities legitimize the subordination of minoritized U.S. communities</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. We need to understand how migrants create new modes of sexual identification, subjectivity, consumption, and coalition, which draw from and transform racial, ethnic, sexual, and cultural communities. Moreover, </span><span class="underline">we need to theorize how these new modes of identification and subjectivity problematize dominant U.S. sexuality categories, epistemologies, and related practices</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. We need to analyze how migrant and citizen sexual practices and ideologies transform one another through unevenly structured exchanges. These questions must be addressed in terms of female, male, and transgender sexualities, in light of the dynamics and contradictions of imperial histories, contemporary globalization, and mass migration. Entry Denied has sought to initiate critical inquiry into these issues. </span><span class="underline">How readers take up the questions will significantly affect future scholarship and also contribute to reshaping the state’s regulation of sexuality and immigration.</span><br />

Questioning current heteronormative discourses key to breaking down current conceptions of family and other social practices. <br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Critiques from postmodern and queer theory challenge the construction of sexualities in gen- eral (Foucault, 1981; Langdridge&amp; Moon, 2008; McPhail, 20 0 4 ; Seidman, 1996 ; Warner, 1993). They assert that </span><span class="underline">by not challenging the gender binary, masculinity and femininity are reified and heterosexuality institutionalized</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Queer theory suggests that </span><span class="underline">the study of homosexuality should </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">not </span><span class="underline">be about </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">the identity of a sexual minor- ity group but rather about </span><span class="underline">the need to question the social practices that “organize “society” as a whole by sexualizing </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">– heterosexualizing or homosexualizing – </span><span class="underline">bodies, desires, acts, identities, social relations, knowledges, cultures, [and] institutions’ </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Seidman, 1996, pp. 12-13). According to Stone-Fish and Harvey (2005), </span><span class="underline">queer identity belongs to “anyone who violates the basic assumptions of heterosexuality</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">” (p. 27). The field of family therapy has taken a stance of accommodating to or managing non-heterosexu- ality by helping families to “cope” with a LGBT member (Stone-Fish &amp; Harvey, 2005). This approach is inherently pathologizing as it posits that any non-heterosexual or gender variant fam- ily member is something to be “managed.” </span><span class="underline">By not questioning current language, false dichotomies and essentialist views, family </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">therapy </span><span class="underline">colludes with the discourses that, at worst, pathologize the natural variability of human nature, and</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, at a minimum, </span><span class="underline">render variations invisible</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. According to Perlesz, Brown, Lindsay, McNair, deVaus and Pitts (2007), </span><span class="underline">a lack of accepted and universally understood terms to describe non-heterosexual family relationships limits family narratives.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The experiences of non-heterosexual parents are not included, invalidating both the parents’ relation- ship and the family as a whole. </span><span class="underline">How would our language change if we embraced the belief that variation is the norm</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">? What would this render possible when working with fami- lies? </span><span class="underline">A true second-order change would not only embrace diversity as normative, but would also uphold the value and beauty of non-heterosexual or gender-variant family members not in spite of their identity but because of it</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. This would be fam- ily therapy transformed. </span><span class="underline">This would actually be breaking down the heterosexual core of the idea of “family</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.” How then might we understand what is unique about families created outside the bounds of heterosexuality, and as a result, how would this inform our work with all families? </span><br />

Any attempt radical politics recreates racial power hierarchies that mean you can never be truly transformative.<br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">I have discussed these examples in order to illustrate two major arguments. Firstly, strategies of cross-identification are central to the queer concepts of transgression. Secondly, transgression is not innocent. </span><span class="underline">The conceptualisation of transgression in queer theory produces its own specific power effects</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Gender is the major or, let us say, the most obvious topic in queer debates about transgression, subversion, and cross-identification. However, although rarely fully recognised in the work of white theorists, </span><span class="underline">these debates are thoroughly racialised</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Martin has drawn attention to the fact that </span><span class="underline">media representations of butch/femme frequently use colour codings</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in order to represent butch/femme couple relation- ships, in that the butch is usually presented as Black and the femme woman as white (1998, 23</span>
