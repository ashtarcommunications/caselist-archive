<strong>Evaluate a CIR Uniqueness debate differently than politics.</strong><br />
<strong>A. The Process determines CIR- the key question in CIR is whether competing special interest groups have pushed their leverage in support of the bill. Even if they have a better uniqueness card if we can prove the process makes it more likely that CIR will pass because of special interest coalitions.</strong><br />
<strong>B. The link outweighs- it devastates the approach in which all constituents agreed in creating the bill. The aff removes an important bargaining chip from the table because the plan removes the only reason they were there. If we win a link vote neg.</strong><br />
<strong>C. CIR is not like other agenda items- it’s a question of key players meeting and coalescing rather than vote count because there won’t be a vote unless all the people involved have a seat on the table.
