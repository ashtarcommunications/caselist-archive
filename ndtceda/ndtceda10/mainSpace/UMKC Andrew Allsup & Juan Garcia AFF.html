None.The past is slippery.Nostalgia is porous.It is a feeling of terminal lossfor what is left behind.Life is in ruins. So is the body.The worst is insomnia and amnesia.You close your eyes and you can not sleep.You open your eyes and there is only darkness.You are in eternal estrangement.Far, far away into the horizon, you see your body wandering.In a twilight zone: Lost. Lost. Perdido y sin rumbo.And, you can not even remember where you are coming fromor where you are heading.You can not make up your head.At that point you are homeless.You are a wanderer.Lost in a cemetery without finding a tomb.From nowhere the shadow of a vampireoffers a glass of blood.You are thirsty.So, you follow the scent.I wake up. My blood is burning.I am afraid of the light.vI run to the mirror.There is no image: my face is gone.There is no memory of what I looked like.My flesh is so pale that there is no reflection.My eyes have no pupils. They are two white balls lost in the whiteness of the darkness.I run away from my body.But I can not even recognize my body.Where is it?Mi cuerpo is not my body anymore.Mi piel is not my skin any more.Mi carne is not my flesh anymore.Mis huesos are not my bones anymore.Mi sangre is not my blood anymore.I must give it away in bloody samples.Drop by drop.Only the vampires can touch it.They are after me.Something is growing inside me.I feel it.My women friends laugh at me.I tell them I have nausea, feel dizzy, and weak.They say “You must be pregnant.”It feels like it.Can a man give birth?I know that something is growing inside me.I feel it.It moves like a fetus from my stomach to my lungs.It swims in my blood trying to be born.What is inside me? What is it?Do women ever have a fear of giving birth to a monster?Oh, mi monstruo!I incubate it.I feed it.I nurse it.I caress it.I cherish it.I rock it in my arms while holding my own body.I hum a lullaby to put it to sleep.It does not allow me to sleep.It doesn’t feel good.Whatever it is. It is growing. Inside me. Slowly. Lentamente.My chest hurts. It itches. I am short of breath.I continually cough.I get constant fevers.I can not hold anything in my stomach.After weeks of sickness,there is no relief.Its breath wakes me up in the middle of the night.All I can think of is horror movies.I sit on the edge on the bed.On the wall all I see is all kind of alienshatching in my body.My lungs are on the edge of exploding.My chest is about to split open.Some kind of Alien creature must be inside me.I scream out loud.I scream to the echoes of my scream.My deaf screaming wakes me up.My chest is in pain.My sweat is a cascade of blood.My saliva is burning lava.I am erupting.I am burning.I am on fire.I take my temperature: 104.8 degrees.I scream: The Alien is inside me.What’s inside me? What is it? (Sandoval-Sánchez) </span></span><br />

<br />
Andrew and I affirm that disease should not be used as grounds for restricting beneficiary eligibility on all topically designated visas <br />
<br />
While the United States has removed restrictions on migrants with HIV/AIDS the logic of exclusion persists by rendering other diseases as grounds for inadmissibility – this exclusionary policy stems from a homeostatic conception of the state as a biological body that must be purified and protected from the diseased foreigner  <br />

<br />
This anxiety about the instability of borders occurs within a fantasy space wherein we envision ourselves as lacking possession and self-definition over the nation – rather than recognizing the strangers within ourselves we displace our feelings of incompleteness onto the figure of the Other whom is trying to either steal or destroy nation – this justifies all acts of violence against the abject  <br />

<br />
<br />
Only by bringing together psychoanalysis and aesthetics in politics can we experience the threatening other not as an external threat but as a stranger within ourselves – this invest politics in an understanding of the self as fundamentally incomplete or lacking – this provides a new trajectory for politics beyond judgments of morality, the beautiful, or the sublime and instead upon the uncanny – this has the power to produce new affective relationships that expose the gaps and discontinuities of national affiliation  <br />

<br />
We must use the debate space to transform our understanding of political discourse where the abject is not merely recognized but allowed to speak – this subverts the traditional paradigm of instrumental politics that forces us to examine dynamics between people rather than the dynamics within them – failure to use the debate as a public space for the other to speak not only denies their voice but renders them devoid of agency and strips them of their very humanity  <br />

<br />
Refusal to engage in an affective politics of the abject propagates an ‘economy of the spectacle’ where our political imaginary becomes colonized by violent images that are treated as commodities to be traded for political points – this hinders our ability to creatively represent our affective and emotional lives and destroys our ability to establish value to life beyond calculations of violence  <br />

<br />
A fixed economy of meaning is impossible – it is only through the enjoyment we receive from our participation in these ‘economies of sacrifice’ that violence against the abject can continue – instead we must reinstate freedom as our political goal through acts of sublimation and artistic expression and sacrificing the idea of sacrifice in politics as the definitive moment of human freedom  <br />

<br />
Our engagement with the abject can foster a new affective politics that can transform borders, sovereignty, and international relations – this reconstitution of the self transforms both our relationship to the other in order to traverse the fantasy of nationhood – rather than seeing the foreigner as an absolute Other threatening our existence we must always first acknowledge the abject inside of ourselves rather than located it as an Other separated from ourselves by a border <br />

Contention One: The homo-terrorist threat <br />
<br />
The ongoing War on Terrorism shares a common root with the violence directed towards queer subjects – attempts to secure a static notion of the family are part and parcel of a broader attempt to securitize ‘American Values’ globally through the War on Terror – homosexuality is treated as a form of terrorism itself – this mentality requires the elimination of all forms of difference that escape our culturally specific and social accepted categories of identity <br />

<br />
The isolation of the terrorist other as an absolute evil, categorically separated and removed from humanity has its origins in a broader history of Heteronormativity and sexual monstrosity – the queer is cut off from humanity by virtue of a double-violation of both the law and nature – this absolute moral dividing line creates the conditions necessary for power to obtain control over a population by rendering them docile subjects to either be corrected or exterminated <br />

Contention Two: Queer Politics <br />
<br />
Andrew and I advocate that the United States federal government should cease to restrict beneficiary eligibility for its family-based visas on the basis of queerness <br />
<br />
Voting affirmative is a gesture to refuse the homo-hetero binary structure that marginalizes queerness through analytical models that make queer politics a structural impossibility – this is an act that forces sexuality into the debate about migration rather than placing it as an occasional add-on <br />
Lubheid, 2k8 <br />

<br />
We must disarticulate the ties between patriotism, nationalism, and cultural identity by refusing to invest ourselves in a heteronormative politics that – on the one hand – incorporate queerness through normalization – and on the other – police an exclusionary notion of citizenship that incites violence against queers – this can only be done by examining the shared histories of queer subjects and forming counter-hegemonic solidarities that break down the dominant militarist, racist, and class-specific power relations of the status quo <br />

<br />
You should endorse the genealogical approach to politics offered by the affirmative to resist the contemporary discourses and practices that limit possibilities to shallow notions immediate claims to freedom or survival – this is the only way to confront the networks of complicities that have limited methods of resistance to the heteronormative anxieties that structure the politics of the status quo <br />

<br />
We endorse a queering of citizenship – rather than normalizing queerness into the false nationalist imaginaries of the status quo – we endorse the erasure of these normativities within the law – queer citizenship is an oppositional and antagonistic politics that destabilizes the power of the law to establish a universal narrative of American citizenship the heteronormative symbolic order that defines contemporary politics <br />

Implementation of the TVPA, for purposes of obtaining a T-Visa, has focused on an extremely narrow interpretation of who constitutes a victim – the requirement for cooperation with law enforcement has given prosecutors the dual power of identifying who constitutes an ‘iconic’ victim and assessing whether or not they have adequately cooperated with an investigation – in short, if one does not construct their political identity in alignment with the elements of a prosecutors ‘iconic victim’ then they will not receive a visa<br />

The prosecutorial interpretation of a ‘iconic victim’ focus’ solely on passive, sexually abused women without any agency or free will - this codifies women’s experience in the unitary discourse of the law universalizes their status as victims – it becomes the a site for the production truth and identity and opens it up to judicial-regulatory domination – not only does this force women to define their identity by their injury in order to be considered a victim but it completely excludes those who identify themselves as anything other than victim<br />

Politics structured around wounded identities produces a form of ressentiment that seeks a sight of external blame in order to produce a guilty agent a site in which revenge can be enacted in order to displace the pain – this produces identity as a reaction to power that must strive to find some sort of meaning in their suffering in order to establish norms and ethical models of response – this destroys the value to life and makes self-affirming politics impossible<br />

Trafficked persons are forced to embrace a political identity defined by their injury – this produces an historical identity rooted in suffering where they must resent life and deplore their exclusion from an ‘ideal’ liberal society in order to maintain a claim to political legitimacy – this operates as an entry point for disciplinary power and the reinscription of injured identity itself<br />
