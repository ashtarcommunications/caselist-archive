Contention One – Inherency<br />
Recruitment of temporary immigrants has stalled – thousands are in limbo<br />
Preston, 1/21/2010 (Julia, Thriving Military Recruitment Program Blocked, New York Times, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/22/us/22recruit.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/22/us/22recruit.html</a>)<br />
A highly successful program by the armed forces to recruit skilled immigrants who live in this country temporarily has run into a roadblock, leaving thousands of potential recruits in limbo. The Army stopped accepting applications for the program last week, officials said Thursday, because the Pentagon had not completed a review required to keep the recruitment going. The program, which started as a pilot in February, allowed recruiters to enlist immigrants, most of them in the Army, with special language or medical skills who are in this country on temporary visas. Successful recruits are offered the chance to become United States citizens within a few months. More than 1,000 immigrants have been enlisted through the program, and hundreds more, at least, are in the final stages of approval, Army officials said. More than 14,000 immigrants have contacted Army recruiters to see if they qualified for the program and have passed a first level of vetting, the officials said.<br />
Advantage 2 – Military Power<br />
Opening the military to immigrants resolves military shortage and provides high-quality recruits<br />
Boot and O’Hanlon, 10/19/2006 (Max - senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, and Michael - senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, A Military Path to Citizenship, Washington Post, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/18/AR2006101801500.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/18/AR2006101801500.html</a>)<br />
Now is the time to consider a new chapter in the annals of American immigration. By inviting foreigners to join the U.S. armed forces in exchange for a promise of citizenship after a four-year tour of duty, we could continue to attract some of the world's most enterprising, selfless and talented individuals. We could provide a new path toward assimilation for undocumented immigrants who are already here but lack the prerequisite for enlistment -- a green card. And we could solve the No. 1 problem facing the Army and Marine Corps: the fact that these services need to grow to meet current commitments yet cannot easily do so (absent a draft) given the current recruiting environment. Not only would immigrants provide a valuable influx of highly motivated soldiers, they would also address one of America's key deficiencies in the battle against Islamist extremists: our lack of knowledge of the languages and mores in the lands where terrorists reside. Newly arrived Americans can help us avoid trampling on local sensitivities and thereby creating more enemies than we eliminate. Skeptics might point out that in the just-concluded fiscal year, the military met most of its recruiting and retention goals. But this was done only by relaxing age and aptitude restrictions, allowing in more individuals with criminal records, and greatly increasing the number of recruiters and advertising dollars. Although we generally support what has been done to date, the logic of these measures cannot be pushed much further.<br />
Temporary immigrants provide a higher-quality pool of recruits<br />
Preston, 2/14/2009 (Julia, U.S. Military Will Offer Path to Citizenship, New York Times, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/15/us/15immig.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/15/us/15immig.html</a>)<br />
Recruiters expect that the temporary immigrants will have more education, foreign language skills and professional expertise than many Americans who enlist, helping the military to fill shortages in medical care, language interpretation and field intelligence analysis. “The American Army finds itself in a lot of different countries where cultural awareness is critical,” said Lt. Gen. Benjamin C. Freakley, the top recruitment officer for the Army, which is leading the pilot program. “There will be some very talented folks in this group.”<br />
Low quality recruits will collapse military strategy and cause counterinsurgency efforts to fail<br />
Kaplan, 1/24/2008 (Fred, The U.S. Army Lowers Recruitment Standards … again, Slate Magazine, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.slate.com/id/2182752/" rel="nofollow">http://www.slate.com/id/2182752/</a>)<br />
The Army is lowering recruitment standards to levels not seen in at least two decades, and the implications are severe—not only for the future of the Army, but also for the direction of U.S. foreign policy. The latest statistics—compiled by the Defense Department. and obtained through the Freedom of Information Act by the Boston-based National Priorities Project—are grim. They show that the percentage of new Army recruits with high-school diplomas has plunged from 94 percent in 2003 to 83.5 percent in 2005 to 70.7 percent in 2007. (The Pentagon's longstanding goal is 90 percent.) The percentage of what the Army calls &quot;high-quality&quot; recruits—those who have high-school diplomas and who score in the upper 50th percentile on the Armed Forces' aptitude tests—has declined from 56.2 percent in 2005 to 44.6 percent in 2007. In order to meet recruitment targets, the Army has even had to scour the bottom of the barrel. There used to be a regulation that no more than 2 percent of all recruits could be &quot;Category IV&quot;—defined as applicants who score in the 10th to 30th percentile on the aptitude tests. In 2004, just 0.6 percent of new soldiers scored so low. In 2005, as the Army had a hard time recruiting, the cap was raised to 4 percent. And in 2007, according to the new data, the Army exceeded even that limit—4.1 percent of new recruits last year were Cat IVs. These trends are worrisome in at least four ways. First, and most broadly, it's not a good idea—for a host of social, political, and moral reasons—to place the burdens of national defense so disproportionately on the most downtrodden citizens. Second, and more practically, high-school dropouts tend to drop out of the military, too. The National Priorities Project cites Army studies finding that 80 percent of high-school graduates finish their first terms of enlistment in the Army—compared with only about half of those with a General Equivalency Degree or no diploma. In other words, taking in more dropouts is a short-sighted method of boosting recruitment numbers. The Army will just have to recruit even more young men and women in the next couple of years, because a lot of the ones they recruited last year will need to be replaced. Third, a dumber army is a weaker army. A study by the RAND Corporation, commissioned by the Pentagon and published in 2005, evaluated several factors that affect military performance—experience, training, aptitude, and so forth—and found that aptitude is key. This was true even of basic combat skills, such as shooting straight. Replacing a tank gunner who had scored Category IV with one who'd scored Category IIIA (in the 50th to 64th percentile) improved the chances of hitting a target by 34 percent. Today's Army, of course, is much more high-tech, from top to bottom. The problem is that when tasks get more technical, aptitude makes an even bigger difference. In one Army study cited by the RAND report, three-man teams from the Army's active-duty signal battalions were told to make a communications system operational. Teams consisting of Category IIIA personnel had a 67 percent chance of succeeding. Teams with Category IIIB soldiers (who had ranked in the 31st to 49th percentile) had a 47 percent chance. Those with Category IVs had only a 29 percent chance. The study also showed that adding a high-scoring soldier to a three-man team increased its chance of success by 8 percent. (This also means that adding a low-scoring soldier to a team reduces its chance by a similar margin.) Fourth, today's Army needs particularly bright soldiers—and it needs, even more, to weed out particularly dim ones—given the direction that at least some of its senior officers want it to take. When the Army was geared to fight large-scaled battles against enemies of comparable strength, imaginative thinking wasn't much required except at a command level. However, now that it's focusing on &quot;asymmetric warfare,&quot; especially counterinsurgency campaigns, such as those in Iraq and Afghanistan, the requirements are different. The crucial engagements—in many ways, the crucial decisions—take place in the streets, door to door, not by armored divisions or brigades but by infantry companies and squads. And when the targets include hearts and minds, every soldier's judgment and actions have an impact. The Army's 2006 field manual on counterinsurgency, which was supervised by Gen. David Petraeus (who is now trying to put its principles into action as U.S. commander in Iraq), emphasized that successful counterinsurgency operations &quot;require Soldiers and Marines at every echelon to possess the following&quot;—and then the authors recite a daunting list of prerequisites, including a &quot;clear, nuanced, and empathetic appreciation of the essential nature of the conflict,&quot; an &quot;understanding of the motivation, strengths, and weaknesses of the insurgent,&quot; rudimentary knowledge of the local culture, and several other admirable qualities. Some of the officers and outside specialists who helped Petraeus write the field manual expressed concerns to me, at the time, that the Army—which was just beginning to lower its standards—might not be up to the demands of this kind of warfare. Given that standards have dipped quite dramatically since—and add to that the problems the Army has had in retaining its most talented junior officers—the concerns now must be graver. It's well-known that the Army might not have enough combat troops to conduct sustained counterinsurgency campaigns. Now it seems the problem may soon be about quality as well as quantity (brains as well as boots). The main reason for the decline in standards is the war in Iraq and its onerous &quot;operations tempo&quot;—soldiers going back for third and fourth tours of duty, with no end in sight. This is well understood among senior officers, and it's a major reason why several Army generals favor a faster withdrawal rate. They worry that fewer young men and women—and now it seems fewer smart young men and women—will sign up if doing so means a guaranteed assignment to Iraq. They worry that, if these trends continue, the Army itself will start to crumble. So, there's a double spiral in effect. The war keeps more good soldiers from enlisting. The lack of good candidates compels the Army to recruit more bad candidates. The swelling ranks of ill-suited soldiers make it harder to fight these kinds of wars effectively.<br />
Shortfalls in recruitment creates a spiral effect that crushes military readiness and emboldens adversaries<br />
Perry et. al., January 2006 (William- former secretary of defense and senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, The U.S. Military, The National Security Advisory Group, p. 11)<br />
If recruiting trends do not improve over the next year, the Army – both active and reserve – will experience great difficulty fully manning its planned force structure and providing the needed rotation base for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. A year from now, the combination of fewer than needed recruits and fewer than needed reenlistments in the junior grades could result in a significant “hollowing” and imbalance in the Army, both active and reserve. Based on DoD’s monthly manpower report by grade, the Army already has a deficit of some 18,000 personnel in its junior enlisted grades (E1-E4). Even if it meets its recruiting and retention goals, the Army is projected to be short some 30,000 soldiers (not including stop loss) by the end of FY2006.11 Such a shortfall would force the Army to cannibalize some units in order to fully man others to deploy. This would negatively impact not only the cohesion of the units deploying but also the readiness and usability of those left at home. It would also exacerbate strains on personnel pulled from recently returned units and reassigned to fill out deploying ones. Such manpower shortfalls will also jeopardize aspects of the Army’s plan to transform its division-based structure into modular brigade combat teams – the Army may simply not have enough people to populate its planned force structure. These factors will create tremendous internal pressures to redeploy additional U.S. forces from Iraq by next spring, whatever the conditions on the ground may be. • If retention rates decline significantly, the viability of the All Volunteer force could be threatened. Many observers of the Army and Marine Corps are now waiting for the other shoe – the retention shoe – to drop. The All Volunteer Force is now in historically uncharted waters: fighting a protracted conflict with volunteers rather than draftees. What will happen if the current surge for Iraq becomes the steady state and the Army and Marines are not resourced with the people, units and equipment they need for a long-term fight? When will the dedication and sacrifice of our troops run up against the needs of families and communities? Will they vote with their feet? If they do, what will become of the All Volunteer Force? The conventional wisdom is that while most will stay in the force after one or even two tours, after a third year-long deployment in a compressed time period, many will choose to leave the force. Many senior military officers who lived through the Vietnam era and its aftermath believe that if significant numbers of senior non- commissioned officers and field grade commanders begin to leave the force, this could set off a mass exodus and lead to a “hollowing out” of the Army. • In the meantime, the United States has only limited ground force capability ready to respond to other contingencies. The absence of a credible strategic reserve in our ground forces increases the risk that potential adversaries will be tempted to challenge the United States. Since the end of World War II, a core element of U.S. strategy has been maintaining a military capable of deterring and, if necessary, defeating aggression in more than one theater at a time. As a global power with global interests, the United States must be able to deal with challenges to its interests in multiple regions of the world simultaneously. Today, however, the United States has only limited ground force capability ready to respond outside the Afghan and Iraqi theaters of operations. If the Army were ordered to send significant forces to another crisis today, its only option would be to deploy units at readiness levels far below what operational plans would require – increasing the risk to the men and women being sent into harm’s way and to the success of the mission. As stated rather blandly in one DoD presentation, the Army “continues to accept risk” in its ability to respond to crises on the Korean Peninsula and elsewhere. Although the United States can still deploy air, naval, and other more specialized assets to deter or respond to aggression, the visible overextension of our ground forces has the potential to significantly weaken our ability to deter and respond to some contingencies.<br />
It’s not about the size of our military lead, but how we use it. A weakened American military invites counter-balancing and aggressive enemies<br />
Spencer, 9/15/2000 (Jack - policy analyst for defense and national security at the Heritage Foundation, The Facts About Military Readiness, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.heritage.org/Research/Reports/2000/09/BG1394-The-Facts-About-Military-Readiness" rel="nofollow">http://www.heritage.org/Research/Reports/2000/09/BG1394-The-Facts-About-Military-Readiness</a>)<br />
U.S. military readiness cannot be gauged by comparing America's armed forces with other nations' militaries. Instead, the capability of U.S. forces to support America's national security requirements should be the measure of U.S. military readiness. Such a standard is necessary because America may confront threats from many different nations at once. America's national security requirements dictate that the armed forces must be prepared to defeat groups of adversaries in a given war. America, as the sole remaining superpower, has many enemies. Because attacking America or its interests alone would surely end in defeat for a single nation, these enemies are likely to form alliances. Therefore, basing readiness on American military superiority over any single nation has little saliency. The evidence indicates that the U.S. armed forces are not ready to support America's national security requirements. Moreover, regarding the broader capability to defeat groups of enemies, military readiness has been declining. The National Security Strategy, the U.S. official statement of national security objectives,3 concludes that the United States &quot;must have the capability to deter and, if deterrence fails, defeat large-scale, cross-border aggression in two distant theaters in overlapping time frames.&quot;4 According to some of the military's highest-ranking officials, however, the United States cannot achieve this goal. Commandant of the Marine Corps General James Jones, former Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Jay Johnson, and Air Force Chief of Staff General Michael Ryan have all expressed serious concerns about their respective services' ability to carry out a two major theater war strategy.5 Recently retired Generals Anthony Zinni of the U.S. Marine Corps and George Joulwan of the U.S. Army have even questioned America's ability to conduct one major theater war the size of the 1991 Gulf War.6 Military readiness is vital because declines in America's military readiness signal to the rest of the world that the United States is not prepared to defend its interests. Therefore, potentially hostile nations will be more likely to lash out against American allies and interests, inevitably leading to U.S. involvement in combat. A high state of military readiness is more likely to deter potentially hostile nations from acting aggressively in regions of vital national interest, thereby preserving peace.<br />
Perception of American strength is critical to prevent aggressive nuclearization strategies that result in first-strikes and nuclear war<br />
Talent and Hall, March 2010 (Jim - distinguished fellow in government relations at the Heritage Foundation, and Heath, Sowing the Wind, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.freedomsolutions.org/2010/03/sowing-the-wind-the-decay-of-american-power-and-its-consequences/" rel="nofollow">http://www.freedomsolutions.org/2010/03/sowing-the-wind-the-decay-of-american-power-and-its-consequences/</a>)<br />
There is a reason that regimes like Iran and North Korea go to the time and expense, and assume the risks of developing nuclear weapons programs; nuclear capability empowers them to achieve their ends, and thereby poses challenges to the United States, for several reasons. First, there is a danger that rogue regimes with nuclear material may assist terrorists in developing weapons of mass destruction.[36] Even the possibility that such regimes may do so gives them leverage internationally. Second, these regimes have ambitions in their regions and around the world.[37] Some of their leaders are fanatical enough to actually consider a first strike using nuclear weapons; for example, high-ranking officials of the Iranian government have openly discussed using a nuclear weapon against Israel.[38] Whether a first strike occurs or not, the possession of nuclear capability frees aggressive regimes to pursue their other goals violently with less fear of retaliation. For example, North Korea’s nuclear capability means that it could attack South Korea conventionally with a measure of impunity; even if the attack failed, the United States and its allies would be less likely to remove the North Korean regime in retaliation. In other words, nuclear capability lessens the penalties which could be exacted on North Korea if it engages in aggression, which makes the aggression more likely. The same logic applies to Iran, which is why the other nations in the Middle East are so concerned about Iran’s nuclear program. A nuclear attack by Iran is possible, but the real danger of Iranian nuclear capability is that it would make conventional aggression in the region more likely.[39] Finally, the more nations that get nuclear weapons, the greater the pressure on other nations to acquire them as a deterrent, and this is particularly true when a government acquiring the capability is seen as unstable or aggressive. North Korea’s possession of nuclear weapons has tended, for obvious reasons, to make the South Koreans and Japanese uncomfortable about having no deterrent themselves. The possibility of uncontrolled proliferation—what experts call a “nuclear cascade”[40]—is tremendously dangerous; it increases the possibility that terrorists can get nuclear material from a national program, and it raises the prospect of a multilateral nuclear confrontation between nations.[41] Many of the smaller nuclear nations do not have well-established first strike doctrine or launch protocols; the chance of a nuclear exchange, accidental or intentional, increases geometrically when a confrontation is multilateral. The antidote to proliferation is American leadership and power. The reality and perception of American strength not only deters aggressive regimes from acquiring weapons of mass destruction; it reassures other countries that they can exist safely under the umbrella of American power without having to develop their own deterrent capability.[42]<br />
Russian and Chinese militarization is inevitable. A weakened American military invites those nations to engage in aggressive foreign policy<br />
Talent and Hall, March 2010 (Jim - distinguished fellow in government relations at the Heritage Foundation, and Heath, Sowing the Wind, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.freedomsolutions.org/2010/03/sowing-the-wind-the-decay-of-american-power-and-its-consequences/" rel="nofollow">http://www.freedomsolutions.org/2010/03/sowing-the-wind-the-decay-of-american-power-and-its-consequences/</a>)<br />
C. THE EMERGENCE OF RUSSIA AND CHINA AS REGIONAL SUPERPOWERS The last few years have seen the reemergence of Russia and China as regional superpowers. Both nations have strong militaries in which they are heavily investing,[43] substantial—and in China’s case—growing economies,[44] demonstrated indifference to human rights,[45] authoritarian regimes that show no signs of becoming democratic and—in Russia’s case—is moving away from democracy,[46] and nationalistic ambitions that are at odds with their neighbors and the United States.[47] Russia and China have been significantly increasing military spending;[48] and unlike the United States, which must pay high manpower costs to sustain a volunteer military, can spend their defense budget mostly on modernizing and procuring their weapons programs.[49] Russia increased military spending by approximately 30% in 2007, 27% in 2006, and 22% in 2005.[50] It is modernizing its submarine fleet and building new short and long-range ballistic missiles. It has highly developed cyber weapon capability,[51] and its army and navy performed far above expectations in the recent invasion of Georgia.[52] The Russians have threatened to use energy as a weapon against Europe and certainly could do so;[53] they control half of the natural gas Europe receives and are promoting an international natural gas cartel similar to OPEC.[54] Russia is building Iran’s nuclear reactor[55] and has systematically obstructed international attempts to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.[56] It has sold sophisticated weapons to Iran,[57] Syria,[58] and Venezuela,[59] and it has long been the source of China’s most sophisticated weaponry, including advanced fighter aircraft and carrier killer supersonic missiles.[60] Russia is controlled by a man—Vladimir Putin—who announced to his Parliament in 2005 that the most tragic event of the 20th century was the collapse of the Soviet Union.[61] China admits to spending approximately $60 billion per year on its military, and to increasing spending by an average of 17% to 18% each year.[62] American intelligence believes that China’s expenditures are actually two to three times higher than it admits.[63] China has money to spend on its armed forces; its economy is growing exponentially, and within the next decade China will have the largest industrial sector in the world.[64] China believes its national interests are served by promoting proliferation, tyranny, and even genocide. It is committing ethnic genocide itself in Tibet,[65] and is supporting genocide in Sudan,[66] oppression in Burma,[67] repression and political terror in Zimbabwe,[68] and nuclear proliferation in North Korea and Iran.[69] China has threatened Taiwan militarily on numerous occasions,[70] and its current military doctrine and procurement policies are aimed at excluding American naval power from the Western Pacific[71] and particularly the Straits of Taiwan.[72] China has an arsenal of submarines armed with carrier killer missiles which it purchased from the Russians,[73] as well as sophisticated fighters;[74] and it is rapidly building up a fleet of modern nuclear submarines, [75] for which it has opened up a base on the island of Hainan.[76] China is ruled by an authoritarian oligarchy that has shown the resiliency to survive the introduction of something like freedom into its economic system. Like Vladimir Putin, the Chinese leaders believe that asserting themselves abroad is a way of unifying their people and stabilizing the regime. In addition, and again like Russia, the Chinese have a history of dominating their part of the world.[77] The Russians and the Chinese have formed a cooperative organization and held unprecedented joint military maneuvers in 2005[78] and again in 2008. They will undoubtedly continue to pursue their national ambitions, particularly in Asia, Eastern Europe, and the former states of the Soviet Union;[79] whether or not they use aggressive tactics depends, as a threshold matter, on their perception of the deterrent strength of the United States.<br />
China perceives American weakness. This results in aggressive policies<br />
Glaser and Morris, 7/9/2009 (Bonnie - senior fellow with the CSIS Freeman Chair in China Studies, and Lyle, Chinese Perceptions of U.S. Decline and Power, China Brief Vol. 9 Iss. 14, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.jamestown.org/programs/chinabrief/single/?tx_ttnews" rel="nofollow">http://www.jamestown.org/programs/chinabrief/single/?tx_ttnews</a>[tt_news]=35241&amp;cHash=db9748f805)<br />
Chinese perceptions of American power are consequential. China’s assessment of the global structure of power is an important factor in Chinese foreign policy decision-making. As long as Chinese leaders perceive a long-lasting American preeminence, averting confrontation with the United States is likely seen as the best option. If Beijing were to perceive the U.S. position as weakening, there could be fewer inhibitions for China to avoid challenging the United States where American and Chinese interests diverge. Since the late-1990s, Beijing has judged the United States as firmly entrenched in the role of sole superpower. As long as the comprehensive national power of China and the other major powers lagged far behind the United States, and the ability of China to forge coalitions to counterbalance U.S. power remained limited, Beijing concertedly avoided challenging U.S. interests around the world; for example, when the United States invaded Iraq. Yet, China’s recent evaluation that the United States is overextended with wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, coupled with a perceived U.S. weakness in the wake of the financial crisis, could imbue Chinese policy makers with the confidence to be more assertive on the international stage in ways that may be inconsistent with American interests.<br />
Perceived weakness controls how China evaluates U.S. deterrence<br />
Christensen, Spring 2001 (Thomas – professor of politics at Princeton, Posing problems without catching up, International Security, p. ebscohost)<br />
On the active defense side, it appears that China is attempting to import and to build indigenously a fairly impressive layered air defense system to counter cruise missiles and advanced aircraft. In addition to reported clandestine acquisition of Patriot technology, China has purchased and is seeking to purchase from Russia an undisclosed number of SA-10 (S-300) and SA-15 (TOR-1) SAM systems. Some of this Russian technology might be successfully integrated into China's own domestically produced SAM systems, such as the HQ-9. [66] China is also working to develop antistealth and antisatellite capabilities. Even if the Chinese programs have only limited effect against more technologically advanced foes, they may still pose a future security challenge to Taiwan and the United States. If Beijing elites believe that they are in a protracted war of wills over an issue that they care about much more than do the Americans, such as Taiwan, those elites might still be emboldened by the perceived capability--however limited--to increase costs to American and Taiwanese forces and to reduce costs to mainland assets in such a struggle. This problem is only exacerbated by any perceptions that Chinese elites might have about America's supposed limited willingness to fight such protracted wars and to suffer casualties. Implications and Prescriptions for U.S. Strategy If the analysis above is correct, preventing war across the Taiwan Strait and between the United States and China is much more difficult than a straightforward net assessment of relative military power in the region might suggest. To deter China from launching attacks against Taiwan and escalating crises and conflicts by attacking American assets in the region, the United States must do more than demonstrate an ability to prevail militarily in a conflict; it must also demonstrate American resolve and, perhaps, the ability to protect its forces not only from defeat but also from significant harm.<br />
US/China war results in extinction<br />
The Straits Times, 6/25/2000 (Regional Fallout: No one gains in war over Taiwan, p. lexis)<br />
THE high-intensity scenario postulates a cross-strait war escalating into a full-scale war between the US and China. If Washington were to conclude that splitting China would better serve its national interests, then a full-scale war becomes unavoidable. Conflict on such a scale would embroil other countries far and near and -- horror of horrors -- raise the possibility of a nuclear war. Beijing has already told the US and Japan privately that it considers any country providing bases and logistics support to any US forces attacking China as belligerent parties open to its retaliation. In the region, this means South Korea, Japan, the Philippines and, to a lesser extent, Singapore. If China were to retaliate, east Asia will be set on fire. And the conflagration may not end there as opportunistic powers elsewhere may try to overturn the existing world order. With the US distracted, Russia may seek to redefine Europe’s political landscape. The balance of power in the Middle East may be similarly upset by the likes of Iraq. In south Asia, hostilities between India and Pakistan, each armed with its own nuclear arsenal, could enter a new and dangerous phase. Will a full-scale Sino-US war lead to a nuclear war? According to General Matthew Ridgeway, commander of the US Eighth Army which fought against the Chinese in the Korean War, the US had at the time thought of using nuclear weapons against China to save the US from military defeat. In his book The Korean War, a personal account of the military and political aspects of the conflict and its implications on future US foreign policy, Gen Ridgeway said that US was confronted with two choices in Korea -- truce or a broadened war, which could have led to the use of nuclear weapons. If the US had to resort to nuclear weaponry to defeat China long before the latter acquired a similar capability, there is little hope of winning a war against China 50 years later, short of using nuclear weapons. The US estimates that China possesses about 20 nuclear warheads that can destroy major American cities. Beijing also seems prepared to go for the nuclear option. A Chinese military officer disclosed recently that Beijing was considering a review of its “non first use” principle regarding nuclear weapons. Major-General Pan Zhangqiang, president of the military-funded Institute for Strategic Studies, told a gathering at the Woodrow Wilson International Centre for Scholars in Washington that although the government still abided by that principle, there were strong pressures from the military to drop it. He said military leaders considered the use of nuclear weapons mandatory if the country risked dismemberment as a result of foreign intervention. Gen Ridgeway said that should that come to pass, we would see the destruction of civilisation.<br />
Weakened resolve invites global aggression<br />

But to physically attack America (as happened on 9/11), or American interests abroad (as in the cases of the embassy bombings and the USS Cole), requires that America also be depicted as weak and vulnerable. It is this perception of America, in the eyes of the Arab world, that represents the greatest threat to Western civilization because Arab misperceptions about America have led to wars. Acts of terrorism are encouraged by the belief that America is essentially weak, vulnerable, and capable of being brought to its knees by a high body-bag count before it has achieved its strategic objectives. It has been this perceived “softness” that has encouraged terrorists like al Qaeda and rogue nations like Iraq, Iran and Syria to act against America and American interests abroad. In the Middle Eastern mindset, it is fatal for any nation to be perceived as weak and vulnerable. And, in many ways, our actions and reactions have led to their perceptions. The explosion of Islamic terror and the threats of mass destruction from an Iraqi tyrant armed with nuclear or biological weapons could have been prevented. For example, in the 90’s, the decade of denial, hesitation and prevarication, U.S. foreign policy consisted of Bill Clinton desperately seeking a legacy, running America by opinion polls, sending cruise missiles to blow up empty tents in the Afghan desert, signing agreements with dictators based on the belief that America would be &quot;safe,&quot; and seeing attacks and provocations as nothing more than a series of separate and unrelated criminal acts rather than as a sustain organized military assault on America. The assumption in those days, according to Claudia Rosett writing in the Wall Street Journal recently, was that “what we didn’t acknowledge, really couldn’t hurt us. As long as we got dictators to sign on the dotted line, we’d be safe......protected by the paperwork that said so.” Decisions to use force were avoided to prevent a confrontation with the Arab and Islamic world, and also in the naive hope that these threats would simply disappear. As a consequence, America focused on the arrest and trial of “the criminals,” protecting buildings rather than tracking down the terrorists and neutralizing their funders, planners, organizers and commanders. Worse, America relied on metal detectors, security guards, electronic surveillance and trials rather than ships, aircraft, soldiers and human intelligence. America studied the acts of terror as distinct from the ideology of the terrorist. It failed to recognize that the cumulative effect of these acts against America and American interests abroad were part of a sustained assault on this country. And our enemies perceived this as American vulnerability. The result was inevitable. This policy of &quot;self-deception&quot; led to the monstrous growth of al Qaeda, the naive Oil-for-Food shell-game with Iraq, the Oslo Accords, and the 1994 &quot;Agreed Framework&quot; with North Korea whereby America proclaimed “peace on the Korean peninsula” in return for allowing North Korea (a soon-to-be-member of the Axis of Evil) food, oil and the wiggle-room necessary to continue making (and marketing) missiles, chemical and biological weapons, and ultimately, its own nuclear weapon. The North Korean fiasco was not the only attempt during the Clinton era at what Charles Krauthammer refers to as &quot;paper diplomacy.&quot; The bloodiest farce was the Oslo &quot;peace&quot; Accords between Israel and the Palestinians. President Clinton insisted that it be signed on the White House lawn under his upraised arms. He then spent the next seven years brokering one new agreement after another while declaring the peace &quot;irreversible.&quot; He knew it was so because Yasser Arafat had promised - in writing - an end to violence and terrorism. Then Arafat decided to start up the violence and terrorism in September 2000, bringing on the worst Israeli-Palestinian bloodshed in decades and leaving the Clinton &quot;paper-pushers&quot; surprised. The absurd UN-run Oil-for-Food program with Iraq was another piece of paper based on the false assumption that Saddam Hussein would respect the written rules crafted by the world’s most hapless bureaucracy - the UN. Needless to say, he didn’t respect the rules, used Syria and Iran to bypass them, and now, he too is on the verge of acquiring nuclear weapons. For too long, America has deluded itself into a false sense of security based upon the written word of dictators, and this delusion has lead to the Arab perception of American weakness. Written agreements didn't work well with Hitler or Mussolini and they still don't. Unfortunately, the Oil-for-Food program, the Oslo Accords and the Korean Agreed Framework were not isolated incidents. The Arab states and al Qaeda took cognizance of the fact that the U.S., in the past, also failed to respond aggressively to many terrorist attacks against its own citizens in Beirut, in Tanzania, in Kenya and in Somalia; stood by while Americans were seized as hostages in Iran and Lebanon; let Saddam Hussein remain in power after the Gulf War (while letting the Shah fall in Iran); and pressured Israel, its ally, to make dangerous strategic concessions while simultaneously courting Israel’s enemies and allowing its prized Arab-Israeli peace process to be destroyed. This policy also led the Chinese to conclude that “the United States is a superpower in decline, losing economic, political and military influence around the world,” according to the congressionally-mandated U.S.-China Security Review Commission. The Commission also noted that “Chinese analysts believe that the United States cannot and will not sustain casualties in pursuit of its vital interests.” That is, America is &quot;soft.&quot; And China is far from alone in holding this opinion. America’s perceived decline into weakness and its questionable “staying power” in pursuit of its strategic objectives has served as a call to arms to the monsters of the world. Astute Middle Eastern observers have made much of the United States' post-Vietnam loathing for foreign adventures, and America's enemies have listened. In the 1970s, when many Iranians worried that American power would destroy their revolution if it went too far, Khomeini told them not to worry, saying America &quot;won't do a damn thing.&quot; And as recently as 1998, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Khomeini's successor, insisted there was no need to negotiate with the United States since Tehran had shown that Washington was “too weak to be feared or heeded.”<br />
Advantage ___ - Cyberwarfare<br />
The threat of cyber warfare is real – Russia and China are developing capabilities that undermine U.S. ag and water infrastructures and increase the risk of nuclear major power wars<br />
Habiger, 2/1/2010 (Eugue – Retired Air Force General, Cyberwarfare and Cyberterrorism, The Cyber Security Institute, p. 11-19)<br />
However, there are reasons to believe that what is going on now amounts to a fundamental shift as opposed to business as usual. Today’s network exploitation or information operation trespasses possess a number of characteristics that suggest that the line between espionage and conflict has been, or is close to being, crossed. (What that suggests for the proper response is a different matter.) First, the number of cyberattacks we are facing is growing significantly. Andrew Palowitch, a former CIA official now consulting with the US Strategic Command (STRATCOM), which oversees the Defense Department’s Joint Task Force‐Global Network Operations, recently told a meeting of experts that the Defense Department has experienced almost 80,000 computer attacks, and some number of these assaults have actually “reduced” the military’s “operational capabilities.”20 Second, the nature of these attacks is starting to shift from penetration attempts aimed at gathering intelligence (cyber spying) to offensive efforts aimed at taking down systems (cyberattacks). Palowitch put this in stark terms last November, “We are currently in a cyberwar and war is going on today.”21 Third, these recent attacks need to be taken in a broader strategic context. Both Russia and China have stepped up their offensive efforts and taken a much more aggressive cyberwarfare posture. The Chinese have developed an openly discussed cyberwar strategy aimed at achieving electronic dominance over the U.S. and its allies by 2050. In 2007 the Department of Defense reported that for the first time China has developed first strike viruses, marking a major shift from prior investments in defensive measures.22 And in the intervening period China has launched a series of offensive cyber operations against U.S. government and private sector networks and infrastructure. In 2007, Gen. James Cartwright, the former head of STRATCOM and now the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the US‐China Economic and Security Review Commission that China’s ability to launch “denial of service” attacks to overwhelm an IT system is of particular concern. 23 Russia also has already begun to wage offensive cyberwar. At the outset of the recent hostilities with Georgia, Russian assets launched a series of cyberattacks against the Georgian government and its critical infrastructure systems, including media, banking and transportation sites.24 In 2007, cyberattacks that many experts attribute, directly or indirectly, to Russia shut down the Estonia government’s IT systems. Fourth, the current geopolitical context must also be factored into any effort to gauge the degree of threat of cyberwar. The start of the new Obama Administration has begun to help reduce tensions between the United States and other nations. And, the new administration has taken initial steps to improve bilateral relations specifically with both China and Russia. However, it must be said that over the last few years the posture of both the Chinese and Russian governments toward America has clearly become more assertive, and at times even aggressive. Some commentators have talked about the prospects of a cyber Pearl Harbor, and the pattern of Chinese and Russian behavior to date gives reason for concern along these lines: both nations have offensive cyberwarfare strategies in place; both nations have taken the cyber equivalent of building up their forces; both nations now regularly probe our cyber defenses looking for gaps to be exploited; both nations have begun taking actions that cross the line from cyberespionage to cyberaggression; and, our bilateral relations with both nations are increasingly fractious and complicated by areas of marked, direct competition. Clearly, there a sharp differences between current U.S. relations with these two nations and relations between the US and Japan just prior to World War II. However, from a strategic defense perspective, there are enough warning signs to warrant preparation. In addition to the threat of cyberwar, the limited resources required to carry out even a large scale cyberattack also makes likely the potential for a significant cyberterror attack against the United States. However, the lack of a long list of specific incidences of cyberterrorism should provide no comfort. There is strong evidence to suggest that al Qaeda has the ability to conduct cyberterror attacks against the United States and its allies. Al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations are extremely active in cyberspace, using these technologies to communicate among themselves and others, carry out logistics, recruit members, and wage information warfare. For example, al Qaeda leaders used email to communicate with the 9‐11 terrorists and the 9‐11 terrorists used the Internet to make travel plans and book flights. Osama bin Laden and other al Qaeda members routinely post videos and other messages to online sites to communicate. Moreover, there is evidence of efforts that al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations are actively developing cyberterrorism capabilities and seeking to carry out cyberterrorist attacks. For example, the Washington Post has reported that “U.S. investigators have found evidence in the logs that mark a browser's path through the Internet that al Qaeda operators spent time on sites that offer software and programming instructions for the digital switches that run power, water, transport and communications grids. In some interrogations . . . al Qaeda prisoners have described intentions, in general terms, to use those tools.”25 Similarly, a 2002 CIA report on the cyberterror threat to a member of the Senate stated that al Qaeda and Hezbollah have become &quot;more adept at using the internet and computer technologies.”26 The FBI has issued bulletins stating that, “U. S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies have received indications that Al Qaeda members have sought information on Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems available on multiple SCADA‐related web sites.”27 In addition a number of jihadist websites, such as 7hj.7hj.com, teach computer attack and hacking skills in the service of Islam.28 While al Qaeda may lack the cyber‐attack capability of nations like Russia and China, there is every reason to believe its operatives, and those of its ilk, are as capable as the cyber criminals and hackers who routinely effect great harm on the world’s digital infrastructure generally and American assets specifically. In fact, perhaps, the most troubling indication of the level of the cyberterrorist threat is the countless, serious non‐terrorist cyberattacks routinely carried out by criminals, hackers, disgruntled insiders, crime syndicates and the like. If run‐of‐the‐mill criminals and hackers can threaten powergrids, hack vital military networks, steal vast sums of money, take down a city’s of traffic lights, compromise the Federal Aviation Administration’s air traffic control systems, among other attacks, it is overwhelmingly likely that terrorists can carry out similar, if not more malicious attacks. Moreover, even if the world’s terrorists are unable to breed these skills, they can certainly buy them. There are untold numbers of cybermercenaries around the world—sophisticated hackers with advanced training who would be willing to offer their services for the right price. Finally, given the nature of our understanding of cyber threats, there is always the possibility that we have already been the victim or a cyberterrorist attack, or such an attack has already been set but not yet effectuated, and we don’t know it yet. Instead, a well‐designed cyberattack has the capacity cause widespread chaos, sow societal unrest, undermine national governments, spread paralyzing fear and anxiety, and create a state of utter turmoil, all without taking a single life. A sophisticated cyberattack could throw a nation’s banking and finance system into chaos causing markets to crash, prompting runs on banks, degrading confidence in markets, perhaps even putting the nation’s currency in play and making the government look helpless and hapless. In today’s difficult economy, imagine how Americans would react if vast sums of money were taken from their accounts and their supporting financial records were destroyed. A truly nefarious cyberattacker could carry out an attack in such a way (akin to Robin Hood) as to engender populist support and deepen rifts within our society, thereby making efforts to restore the system all the more difficult. A modestly advanced enemy could use a cyberattack to shut down (if not physically damage) one or more regional power grids. An entire region could be cast into total darkness, power‐dependent systems could be shutdown. An attack on one or more regional power grids could also cause cascading effects that could jeopardize our entire national grid. When word leaks that the blackout was caused by a cyberattack, the specter of a foreign enemy capable of sending the entire nation into darkness would only increase the fear, turmoil and unrest. While the finance and energy sectors are considered prime targets for a cyberattack, an attack on any of the 17 delineated critical infrastructure sectors could have a major impact on the United States. For example, our healthcare system is already technologically driven and the Obama Administration’s e‐health efforts will only increase that dependency. A cyberattack on the U.S. e‐health infrastructure could send our healthcare system into chaos and put countless of lives at risk. Imagine if emergency room physicians and surgeons were suddenly no longer able to access vital patient information. A cyberattack on our nation’s water systems could likewise cause widespread disruption. An attack on the control systems for one or more dams could put entire communities at risk of being inundated, and could create ripple effects across the water, agriculture, and energy sectors. Similar water control system attacks could be used to at least temporarily deny water to otherwise arid regions, impacting everything from the quality of life in these areas to agriculture. In 2007, the U.S. Cyber Consequences Unit determined that the destruction from a single wave of cyberattacks on critical infrastructures could exceed $700 billion, which would be the rough equivalent of 50 Katrina‐esque hurricanes hitting the United States all at the same time.29 Similarly, one IT security source has estimated that the impact of a single day cyberwar attack that focused on and disrupted U.S. credit and debit card transactions would be approximately $35 billion.30 Another way to gauge the potential for harm is in comparison to other similar noncyberattack infrastructure failures. For example, the August 2003 regional power grid blackout is estimated to have cost the U.S. economy up to $10 billion, or roughly .1 percent of the nation’s GDP. 31 That said, a cyberattack of the exact same magnitude would most certainly have a much larger impact. The origin of the 2003 blackout was almost immediately disclosed as an atypical system failure having nothing to do with terrorism. This made the event both less threatening and likely a single time occurrence. Had it been disclosed that the event was the result of an attack that could readily be repeated the impacts would likely have grown substantially, if not exponentially. Additionally, a cyberattack could also be used to disrupt our nation’s defenses or distract our national leaders in advance of a more traditional conventional or strategic attack. Many military leaders actually believe that such a disruptive cyber pre‐offensive is the most effective use of offensive cyber capabilities. This is, in fact, the way Russia utilized cyberattackers—whether government assets, governmentdirected/ coordinated assets, or allied cyber irregulars—in advance of the invasion of Georgia. Widespread distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks were launched on the Georgian governments IT systems. Roughly a day later Russian armor rolled into Georgian territory. The cyberattacks were used to prepare the battlefield; they denied the Georgian government a critical communications tool isolating it from its citizens and degrading its command and control capabilities precisely at the time of attack. In this way, these attacks were the functional equivalent of conventional air and/or missile strikes on a nation’s communications infrastructure.32 One interesting element of the Georgian cyberattacks has been generally overlooked: On July 20th, weeks before the August cyberattack, the website of Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili was overwhelmed by a more narrowly focused, but technologically similar DDOS attack.33 This should be particularly chilling to American national security experts as our systems undergo the same sorts of focused, probing attacks on a constant basis. The ability of an enemy to use a cyberattack to counter our offensive capabilities or soften our defenses for a wider offensive against the United States is much more than mere speculation. In fact, in Iraq it is already happening. Iraq insurgents are now using off‐the‐shelf software (costing just $26) to hack U.S. drones (costing $4.5 million each), allowing them to intercept the video feed from these drones.34 By hacking these drones the insurgents have succeeded in greatly reducing one of our most valuable sources of real‐time intelligence and situational awareness. If our enemies in Iraq are capable of such an effective cyberattack against one of our more sophisticated systems, consider what a more technologically advanced enemy could do. At the strategic level, in 2008, as the United States Central Command was leading wars in both Iraq and Afghanistan, a cyber intruder compromised the security of the Command and sat within its IT systems, monitoring everything the Command was doing. 35 This time the attacker simply gathered vast amounts of intelligence. However, it is clear that the attacker could have used this access to wage cyberwar—altering information, disrupting the flow of information, destroying information, taking down systems—against the United States forces already at war. Similarly, during 2003 as the United States prepared for and began the War in Iraq, the IT networks of the Department of Defense were hacked 294 times.36 By August of 2004, with America at war, these ongoing attacks compelled then‐Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz to write in a memo that, &quot;Recent exploits have reduced operational capabilities on our networks.&quot;37 This wasn’t the first time that our national security IT infrastructure was penetrated immediately in advance of a U.S. military option.38 In February of 1998 the Solar Sunrise attacks systematically compromised a series of Department of Defense networks. What is often overlooked is that these attacks occurred during the ramp up period ahead of potential military action against Iraq. The attackers were able to obtain vast amounts of sensitive information—information that would have certainly been of value to an enemy’s military leaders. There is no way to prove that these actions were purposefully launched with the specific intent to distract American military assets or degrade our capabilities. However, such ambiguities—the inability to specifically attribute actions and motives to actors—are the very nature of cyberspace. Perhaps, these repeated patterns of behavior were mere coincidence, or perhaps they weren’t. The potential that an enemy might use a cyberattack to soften physical defenses, increase the gravity of harms from kinetic attacks, or both, significantly increases the potential harms from a cyberattack. Consider the gravity of the threat and risk if an enemy, rightly or wrongly, believed that it could use a cyberattack to degrade our strategic weapons capabilities. Such an enemy might be convinced that it could win a war—conventional or even nuclear—against the United States. The effect of this would be to undermine our deterrence‐based defenses, making us significantly more at risk of a major war.<br />
Perceived weakness controls how China evaluates U.S. deterrence<br />
Christensen, Spring 2001 (Thomas – professor of politics at Princeton, Posing problems without catching up, International Security, p. ebscohost)<br />
On the active defense side, it appears that China is attempting to import and to build indigenously a fairly impressive layered air defense system to counter cruise missiles and advanced aircraft. In addition to reported clandestine acquisition of Patriot technology, China has purchased and is seeking to purchase from Russia an undisclosed number of SA-10 (S-300) and SA-15 (TOR-1) SAM systems. Some of this Russian technology might be successfully integrated into China's own domestically produced SAM systems, such as the HQ-9. [66] China is also working to develop antistealth and antisatellite capabilities. Even if the Chinese programs have only limited effect against more technologically advanced foes, they may still pose a future security challenge to Taiwan and the United States. If Beijing elites believe that they are in a protracted war of wills over an issue that they care about much more than do the Americans, such as Taiwan, those elites might still be emboldened by the perceived capability--however limited--to increase costs to American and Taiwanese forces and to reduce costs to mainland assets in such a struggle. This problem is only exacerbated by any perceptions that Chinese elites might have about America's supposed limited willingness to fight such protracted wars and to suffer casualties. Implications and Prescriptions for U.S. Strategy If the analysis above is correct, preventing war across the Taiwan Strait and between the United States and China is much more difficult than a straightforward net assessment of relative military power in the region might suggest. To deter China from launching attacks against Taiwan and escalating crises and conflicts by attacking American assets in the region, the United States must do more than demonstrate an ability to prevail militarily in a conflict; it must also demonstrate American resolve and, perhaps, the ability to protect its forces not only from defeat but also from significant harm.<br />
US/China war results in extinction<br />
The Straits Times, 6/25/2000 (Regional Fallout: No one gains in war over Taiwan, p. lexis)<br />
THE high-intensity scenario postulates a cross-strait war escalating into a full-scale war between the US and China. If Washington were to conclude that splitting China would better serve its national interests, then a full-scale war becomes unavoidable. Conflict on such a scale would embroil other countries far and near and -- horror of horrors -- raise the possibility of a nuclear war. Beijing has already told the US and Japan privately that it considers any country providing bases and logistics support to any US forces attacking China as belligerent parties open to its retaliation. In the region, this means South Korea, Japan, the Philippines and, to a lesser extent, Singapore. If China were to retaliate, east Asia will be set on fire. And the conflagration may not end there as opportunistic powers elsewhere may try to overturn the existing world order. With the US distracted, Russia may seek to redefine Europe’s political landscape. The balance of power in the Middle East may be similarly upset by the likes of Iraq. In south Asia, hostilities between India and Pakistan, each armed with its own nuclear arsenal, could enter a new and dangerous phase. Will a full-scale Sino-US war lead to a nuclear war? According to General Matthew Ridgeway, commander of the US Eighth Army which fought against the Chinese in the Korean War, the US had at the time thought of using nuclear weapons against China to save the US from military defeat. In his book The Korean War, a personal account of the military and political aspects of the conflict and its implications on future US foreign policy, Gen Ridgeway said that US was confronted with two choices in Korea -- truce or a broadened war, which could have led to the use of nuclear weapons. If the US had to resort to nuclear weaponry to defeat China long before the latter acquired a similar capability, there is little hope of winning a war against China 50 years later, short of using nuclear weapons. The US estimates that China possesses about 20 nuclear warheads that can destroy major American cities. Beijing also seems prepared to go for the nuclear option. A Chinese military officer disclosed recently that Beijing was considering a review of its “non first use” principle regarding nuclear weapons. Major-General Pan Zhangqiang, president of the military-funded Institute for Strategic Studies, told a gathering at the Woodrow Wilson International Centre for Scholars in Washington that although the government still abided by that principle, there were strong pressures from the military to drop it. He said military leaders considered the use of nuclear weapons mandatory if the country risked dismemberment as a result of foreign intervention. Gen Ridgeway said that should that come to pass, we would see the destruction of civilisation.<br />
Cyberwarfare results in accidental war<br />
Stephen Cimbala, professor of political science at the Pennsylvania State University Delaware County Campus, Summer 1999, Armed Forces &amp; Society: An Interdisciplinary Journal<br />
The nuclear shadow over the information age remains significant. The essence of information warfare is in subtlety and deception: the manipulation of uncertainty. The essence of nuclear deterrence lies in the credible and certain threat of retaliation backed by an information environment accepted and trusted by both sides in a partly competitive, partly conflictual relationship. Nuclear assets may themselves become the targets of cyberwarriors. Triumphalism about the RMA in high technology conventional weapons overlooks asymmetrical strategies that might appeal to U.S. opponents. Among these might be the reciprocal use of information warfare to deny U.S. access in time of need to a timely nuclear response or to a credible nuclear threat. But even more problematic is the potential collision course between intentional information warfare and unintended side effects when cyberwar is waged against a nuclear armed state, especially one with a non-Western culture. Neither the status of nuclear forces in the new world order, nor all of the military implications of the information revolution, are apparent now. There are reasons to suppose that the strategies and technologies of information warfare will develop along one track, whereas efforts to control nuclear weapons spread and to establish the safety and security of existing nuclear arsenals will involve a different community of specialists and attentive publics. Nevertheless, there are sufficient grounds to be concerned that a too successful menu of information strategies may contribute to a failure of nuclear deterrence in the form of accidental/inadvertent war or escalation. Unplanned interactions between infowarriors and deterrers could have unfortunate byproducts.<br />
The nuclear infrastructure is vulnerable to cyberwarfare<br />
Fritz, July 2009 (Jason - former Captain of the U.S. Army, Hacking Nuclear Command and Control, p. 17-18)<br />
Cyber terrorists could cause incorrect information to be transmitted, received, or displayed at nuclear command and control centres, or shut down these centres’ computer networks completely. In 1995, a Norwegian scientific sounding rocket was mistaken by Russian early warning systems as a nuclear missile launched from a US submarine. A radar operator used Krokus to notify a general on duty who decided to alert the highest levels. Kavkaz was implemented, all three chegets activated, and the countdown for a nuclear decision began. It took eight minutes before the missile was properly identified—a considerable amount of time considering the speed with which a nuclear response must be decided upon (Aftergood 2000). Creating a false signal in these early warning systems would be relatively easy using computer network operations. The real difficulty would be gaining access to these systems as they are most likely on a closed network. However, if they are transmitting wirelessly, that may provide an entry point, and information gained through the internet may reveal the details, such as passwords and software, for gaining entrance to the closed network. If access was obtained, a false alarm could be followed by something like a DDoS attack, so the operators believe an attack may be imminent, yet they can no longer verify it. This could add pressure to the decision making process, and if coordinated precisely, could appear as a first round EMP burst. Terrorist groups could also attempt to launch a non-nuclear missile, such as the one used by Norway, in an attempt to fool the system. The number of states who possess such technology is far greater than the number of states who possess nuclear weapons. Obtaining them would be considerably easier, especially when enhancing operations through computer network operations. Combining traditional terrorist methods with cyber techniques opens opportunities neither could accomplish on their own. For example, radar stations might be more vulnerable to a computer attack, while satellites are more vulnerable to jamming from a laser beam, thus together they deny dual phenomenology. Mapping communications networks through cyber reconnaissance may expose weaknesses, and automated scanning devices created by more experienced hackers can be readily found on the internet.<br />
That escalates to global nuclear war<br />
Lachlan Forrow, MD, et al, “Accidental Nuclear War – A Post-Cold War Assessment”, New England Journal of Medicine, 1998, iis-db.stanford.edu/pubs/20625/acciden_nuke_war.pdf<br />
The direct toll that would result from an accidental nuclear attack of the type described above would dwarf all prior accidents in history. Furthermore, such an attack, even if accidental, might prompt a retaliatory response resulting in an all-out nuclear exchange. The World Health Organization has estimated that this would result in billions of direct and indirect casualties worldwide.<br />
US/Russian war causes extinction – most probable<br />
Nick Bostrom, professor of philosophy - Oxford University, March, 2002, Existential Risks: Analyzing Human Extinction Scenarios and Related Hazards, Journal of Evolution and Technology, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nickbostrom.com/existential/risks.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nickbostrom.com/existential/risks.html</a><br />
A much greater existential risk emerged with the build-up of nuclear arsenals in the US and the USSR. An all-out nuclear war was a possibility with both a substantial probability and with consequences that might have been persistent enough to qualify as global and terminal. There was a real worry among those best acquainted with the information available at the time that a nuclear Armageddon would occur and that it might annihilate our species or permanently destroy human civilization.[4] Russia and the US retain large nuclear arsenals that could be used in a future confrontation, either accidentally or deliberately. There is also a risk that other states may one day build up large nuclear arsenals. Note however that a smaller nuclear exchange, between India and Pakistan for instance, is not an existential risk, since it would not destroy or thwart humankind’s potential permanently. Such a war might however be a local terminal risk for the cities most likely to be targeted. Unfortunately, we shall see that nuclear Armageddon and comet or asteroid strikes are mere preludes to the existential risks that we will encounter in the 21st century.<br />
Expansion of arid lands results in extinction<br />
Barlow 2001(Maude, National Chairperson, Council of Canadians Chair, IFG Committee on the Globalization of Water, &quot;Blue Gold: The Global Water Crisis and the Commodification of the World's Water Supply&quot;)<br />
However, if the earth's surface is paved over, denuded of forests and meadows, and drained of natural springs and creeks, the drop will not form part of river basins and continental watersheds, where it is needed by people and animals, but head out to sea, where it will be stored. It is like rain falling onto a huge roof, or umbrella; everything underneath stays dry and the water runs off to the perimeter. The consequent reduction in continental water basins results in reduced water evaporation from the earth's surface, and becomes a net loss, while the seas begin to rise. In Slovakia, the scientists found, for every 1 percent of roofing, paving, car parks and highways constructed, water supplies decrease in volume by more than 100 billion meters per year. Kravèík issues a dire warning about the growing number of what he calls the earth's &quot;hot stains&quot;—places already drained of water. The &quot;drying out&quot; of the earth will cause massive global warming, with the attendant extremes in weather: drought, decreased protection from the atmosphere, increased solar radiation, decreased biodiversity, melting of the polar icecaps, submersion of vast territories, massive continental desertification and, eventually, &quot;global collapse.&quot;<br />
Ag collapse results in global conflict<br />
Calvin 1998 (William, Theoretical Neurophysiologist – U Washington, Atlantic Monthly, January, Vol 281, No. 1, p. 47-64)<br />
The population-crash scenario is surely the most appalling. Plummeting crop yields would cause some powerful countries to try to take over their neighbors or distant lands -- if only because their armies, unpaid and lacking food, would go marauding, both at home and across the borders. The better-organized countries would attempt to use their armies, before they fell apart entirely, to take over countries with significant remaining resources, driving out or starving their inhabitants if not using modern weapons to accomplish the same end: eliminating competitors for the remaining food. This would be a worldwide problem -- and could lead to a Third World War -- but Europe's vulnerability is particularly easy to analyze. The last abrupt cooling, the Younger Dryas, drastically altered Europe's climate as far east as Ukraine. Present-day Europe has more than 650 million people. It has excellent soils, and largely grows its own food. It could no longer do so if it lost the extra warming from the North Atlantic.<br />
Lack of cyber defense increases the likelihood of escalation<br />
Kakutani, 4/26/2010 (Michiko, The Attack Coming From Bytes, Not Bomb, The New York Times, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/27/books/27book.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/27/books/27book.html</a>)<br />
The United States’ lack of an effective cyberdefense system, Mr. Clarke ominously warns, “will tempt opponents to attack in a period of tensions,” and it could also tempt America to take pre-emptive action or escalate a cyberconflict very rapidly if attacked. Were such a war to start, it could easily jump international boundaries, causing cascades of collateral damage to unspool around the world.<br />
Retaliation escalates to global nuclear war<br />
Lawson, 5/13/2009 (Sean - assistant professor in the Department of Communication at the University of Utah, Cross-Domain Response to Cyber Attacks and the Threat of Conflict, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.seanlawson.net/?p=477" rel="nofollow">http://www.seanlawson.net/?p=477</a>)<br />
At a time when it seems impossible to avoid the seemingly growing hysteria over the threat of cyber war,[1] network security expert Marcus Ranum delivered a refreshing talk recently, “The Problem with Cyber War,” that took a critical look at a number of the assumptions underlying contemporary cybersecurity discourse in the United States. He addressed one issue in partiuclar that I would like to riff on here, the issue of conflict escalation–i.e. the possibility that offensive use of cyber attacks could escalate to the use of physical force. As I will show, his concerns are entirely legitimate as current U.S. military cyber doctrine assumes the possibility of what I call “cross-domain responses” to cyberattacks. Backing Your Adversary (Mentally) into a Corner Based on the premise that completely blinding a potential adversary is a good indicator to that adversary that an attack is iminent, Ranum has argued that “The best thing that you could possibly do if you want to start World War III is launch a cyber attack. [...] When people talk about cyber war like it’s a practical thing, what they’re really doing is messing with the OK button for starting World War III. We need to get them to sit the f-k down and shut the f-k up.” [2] He is making a point similar to one that I have made in the past: Taking away an adversary’s ability to make rational decisions could backfire. [3] For example, Gregory Witol cautions that “attacking the decision maker’s ability to perform rational calculations may cause more problems than it hopes to resolveÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Removing the capacity for rational action may result in completely unforeseen consequences, including longer and bloodier battles than may otherwise have been.” [4] Ã¯Â»Â¿Cross-Domain Response So, from a theoretical standpoint, I think his concerns are well founded. But the current state of U.S. policy may be cause for even greater concern. It’s not just worrisome that a hypothetical blinding attack via cyberspace could send a signal of imminent attack and therefore trigger an irrational response from the adversary. What is also cause for concern is that current U.S. policy indicates that “kinetic attacks” (i.e. physical use of force) are seen as potentially legitimate responses to cyber attacks. Most worrisome is that current U.S. policy implies that a nuclear response is possible, something that policy makers have not denied in recent press reports. The reason, in part, is that the U.S. defense community has increasingly come to see cyberspace as a “domain of warfare” equivalent to air, land, sea, and space. The definition of cyberspace as its own domain of warfare helps in its own right to blur the online/offline, physical-space/cyberspace boundary. But thinking logically about the potential consequences of this framing leads to some disconcerting conclusions. If cyberspace is a domain of warfare, then it becomes possible to define “cyber attacks” (whatever those may be said to entail) as acts of war. But what happens if the U.S. is attacked in any of the other domains? It retaliates. But it usually does not respond only within the domain in which it was attacked. Rather, responses are typically “cross-domain responses”–i.e. a massive bombing on U.S. soil or vital U.S. interests abroad (e.g. think 9/11 or Pearl Harbor) might lead to air strikes against the attacker. Even more likely given a U.S. military “way of warfare” that emphasizes multidimensional, “joint” operations is a massive conventional (i.e. non-nuclear) response against the attacker in all domains (air, land, sea, space), simultaneously. The possibility of “kinetic action” in response to cyber attack, or as part of offensive U.S. cyber operations, is part of the current (2006) National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations [5]: (U) Kinetic Actions. DOD will conduct kinetic missions to preserve freedom of action and strategic advantage in cyberspace. Kinetic actions can be either offensive or defensive and used in conjunction with other mission areas to achieve optimal military effects. Of course, the possibility that a cyber attack on the U.S. could lead to a U.S. nuclear reply constitutes possibly the ultimate in “cross-domain response.” And while this may seem far fetched, it has not been ruled out by U.S. defense policy makers and is, in fact, implied in current U.S. defense policy documents. From the National Military Strategy of the United States (2004): “The term WMD/E relates to a broad range of adversary capabilities that pose potentially devastating impacts. WMD/E includes chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and enhanced high explosive weapons as well as other, more asymmetrical ‘weapons’. They may rely more on disruptive impact than destructive kinetic effects. For example, cyber attacks on US commercial information systems or attacks against transportation networks may have a greater economic or psychological effect than a relatively small release of a lethal agent.” [6] The authors of a 2009 National Academies of Science report on cyberwarfare respond to this by saying, “Coupled with the declaratory policy on nuclear weapons described earlier, this statement implies that the United States will regard certain kinds of cyberattacks against the United States as being in the same category as nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons, and thus that a nuclear response to certain kinds of cyberattacks (namely, cyberattacks with devastating impacts) may be possible. It also sets a relevant scale–a cyberattack that has an impact larger than that associated with a relatively small release of a lethal agent is regarded with the same or greater seriousness.” [7]<br />
Highly skilled recruits are the critical internal link to cyber security<br />
Conti and Easterly, 7/29/2010 (Gregory - academy professor and director of West Point’s Cyber Security Research Center, and Jen - member of the US Cyber Command Commander’s Action Group, Recruiting, development, and retention of cyber warriors despite an inhospitable culture, Small Wars Journal, p. 1-2)<br />
Make no mistake, our nation faces persistent, widespread and growing threats in cyberspace. Across the array of dangerous actors and their capabilities, we’ve witnessed an evolution from data compromise and loss, to the disruption of information networks to the physical destruction of information systems. Our military forces, in particular, depend heavily on classified and unclassified networks for command and control, intelligence, operations and logistics. These networks – over 15,000 of them – represent a very tempting target, and the number of attacks against them has increased dramatically over the past several years. The United States Government recognized the clear and present danger posed by this increasingly perilous threat environment and created United States Cyber Command. We are at a unique cusp in history, as we have the first-ever opportunity to create a large-scale organization to fight and win wars in cyber space. This isn’t a trivial undertaking; there are myriad details that must be addressed. In this article, we focus on what is arguably the most important – the human dimension, specifically how we attract, develop, and retain a world-class cadre of cyber warriors. By building the best possible team and creating an environment that attracts more, we can lay the foundation upon which we can successfully build Cyber Command. However, while the Defense Department has endorsed Cyber Command, the kinetic warfighting culture generally has not. Positive strides have been made recently to include the development of the Navy’s Information Dominance Corps and planned establishment of the Army’s Cyber Brigade. However, building the most effective Cyber Command will require fundamentally changing military culture – specifically how we think about networks and how we manage the talent that we need to leverage these networks for warfighting effects. Uncomfortable, but necessary change will be required, else we risk creating a large bureaucracy, staffed with marginally effective individuals, a “Cyber Command” in name only. This article presents a viable way ahead and suggests actionable solutions for building, developing and retaining a world-class team. The rise of the cyber domain as the battleground of the 21st Century provides a dramatic new environment in which the current United States military is ill-equipped to operate successfully. Today’s military excels at recruiting, developing, and retaining kinetic warfighting expertise, but is ill-suited for recruiting, developing, and retaining creative and intellectual talent on the scale required to successfully operate in the contested cyber domain. Until the end of the 20th Century combat arms expertise ruled the day, but in the 21st Century kinetic combat arms soldiers must learn to co-exist, cooperate, and coordinate with non-kinetic cyber warriors. Key to creating a formidable force in cyberspace is the recruitment, development, and retention of highly skilled individuals. The dynamics in play are significantly different from traditional military recruiting. The nation faces a severe shortage of information security savvy talent. The pool of candidates dwindles even more when considering such constraints as the ability to receive a Top Secret clearance, possession of U.S. citizenship, desire to undergo repeated drug tests, and, in some circumstances, ability to pass a polygraph exam. The combination of a highly competitive job market and a relatively small pool of candidates require the military to actively create a culture that attracts, not repels, talent. So how do potential cyber warriors perceive the military? It isn’t a pretty picture.<br />
Recruiting immigrants to the military solves the shortfall in cyberwarfare<br />
Haddick, 8/6/2010 (Robert - editor of Small Wars Journal, Uncle Sam Wants You…Whoever You Are, Foreign Policy, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/08/06/this_week_at_war_uncle_sam_wants_you_whoever_you_are" rel="nofollow">http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/08/06/this_week_at_war_uncle_sam_wants_you_whoever_you_are</a>)<br />
Writing in Small Wars Journal, Gregory Conti and Jen Easterly, both U.S. Army lieutenant colonels, discussed the problems the military faces recruiting &quot;cyber warriors&quot; into the newly created Cyber Command, which aims to &quot;conduct full-spectrum military cyberspace operations in order to ... ensure US/Allied freedom of action in cyberspace and deny the same to our adversaries.&quot; Yet Conti and Easterly note that Cyber Command will recruit from an already tiny pool of cybersavvy talent, a pool made even smaller by Cyber Command's requirement that its soldiers pass security clearances, polygraph examinations, and drug screening. Meanwhile, Cyber Command will have to compete with the likes of Google for talented techies who may not find military culture all that inviting. It should come as no surprise to eventually find Cyber Command mostly staffed by highly-paid civilian contractors rather than uniformed soldiers or career civil servants. Cyber Command's recruiting difficulties are a microcosm of the broader troubles the military, especially the Army, now faces. The all-volunteer military has been a success and should be retained. But evidence continues to mount that the Army has grown as big as it can under the all-volunteer system. If circumstances ever required a significantly larger Army, Army leaders and U.S. society would have to get used to an Army of much lower quality at the margin. Deploying such a force, especially into stability operations, would entail taking greater risks and paying higher costs. The recently released Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) Independent Panel report called for an overhaul in the military's personnel system. The report concluded that compensation costs for the all-volunteer force have exploded and are no longer sustainable. Active-duty head count has declined from 2 million in 1991 to 1.37 million in 2009. Yet in spite of this 32 percent decline in head count, military personnel costs (in constant 2005 dollars) have grown from $122 billion in 1991 to $130 billion in 2009 ($60,939 per head in 1991 versus $94,533 per head in 2009, adjusted for inflation). Even with this vast expansion in soldier compensation, the Army has had to reduce enlistment standards to fill its ranks. According to the QDR Independent Panel, these reduced standards include raising the maximum enlistment age to 42; accepting more recruits without high school diplomas, with criminal records, and in Category IV (low mental aptitude) on the Armed Forces Qualification Test; and increasing the numbers of noncitizens serving. The overall population of the United States is growing, but the cohort qualified and willing to volunteer for military service is shrinking. (Seventy-five percent of American youth are ineligible for military service for physical, mental, or educational reasons, or due to criminal records.) The prime recruiting base seems to be narrowing by geographic area and to families of veterans, increasingly turning military service into a &quot;family guild.&quot; Immediately after taking office, Defense Secretary Robert Gates directed the Army and Marine Corps to increase their headcounts in response to the pressures of Iraq and Afghanistan. Regrettably, this decision collided with the evaporating pool of suitable military recruits. The Army recently released a report that studied suicide prevention and the Army's mental-health issues. The report revealed a broader range of rising high-risk behaviors and criminality in the Army's ranks. Part, maybe most, of the increasing incidence of suicide in the Army is related to the strain of wartime deployments. But the report noted that 68 of the 120 suicides (57 percent) the Army suffered during the first half of 2010 were to soldiers who had zero or one deployment. Over the past five years, the Army has suffered from increasing rates of discipline problems, crime, and drug use. The suicide prevention report noted that during this time, enlistment waivers increased and soldiers who previously would have been dismissed during initial training for unsuitability were instead retained, presumably due to the requirement to increase the Army's head count. Indeed, the Army calculated that one-third of the soldiers recruited to meet the Army's higher end-strength would have been dismissed from the service under the previous quality standards. It seems highly likely that the Army's retention of soldiers it would previously have found unsuitable for service is related to the increased suicide rate, along with other behavior problems. Thus, in spite of sharply increased (and in my view, well-deserved) compensation, the Army has reached an upper boundary on its size -- unless Army leaders and the country are willing to accept rapidly declining quality and rapidly increasing trouble at the margin. The increasing U.S. population is not offsetting the declining propensity to volunteer for military service or the shrinking percentage of the youth cohort medically, mentally, or socially qualified to serve. If the Army has reached the bottom of its U.S.-based recruiting pool, where could it go for additional manpower if it needed to? The U.S. military has a long tradition of recruiting non-citizens into its ranks. This would be a tempting option for expansion although language, culture, and security clearance problems place limits on its use. Instead, foreign auxiliary forces, organized, trained, and equipped by U.S. special operations forces, are likely to be used to supplement deployed U.S. forces, especially during long low-intensity stabilization operations.<br />
Contention Three – Solvency<br />
The stalled pilot program proves that the plan will lead to an influx of highly-skilled recruits<br />
Rangel, 2/2/2010 (Danny, Flourishing Military Recruitment Plan Stalled, Change.org, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://news.change.org/stories/flourishing_military_recruitment_plan_stalled" rel="nofollow">http://news.change.org/stories/flourishing_military_recruitment_plan_stalled</a>)<br />
Given the increasingly difficult and sometimes prohibitively expensive process of gaining American citizenship, many immigrants have welcomed military service as a means of becoming citizens. Within a very short span of time after the program's creation, the Army exceeded its recruiting expectations; yielding, by its own account, particularly high-quality servicemembers. In the hopes of qualifying for the program, more than 14,000 immigrants have contacted the military and passed a first round of vetting. For the pilot program to continue, the Defense Department needed to complete a review of the (clearly successful) program. Instead, it opted to drag its heels. No doubt, the general incompetence of a government bureaucracy played a role here. Unable to see a good thing in front of them, the Defense Department instead chose a route that hurts our military, as in the case of another senseless decision regarding nine Army linguists dismissed because they were discovered to be homosexual. Let us not forget that America is in the midst of two wars, which demand the skills of those who are willing to serve. Although the current economic crisis has, for the time being, dramatically increased recruiting numbers throughout the country, the increased troop presence forecast for Afghanistan, the ever-dangerous situation in Iraq, aid efforts in Haiti, and other foreign military commitments require a steady stream of new service members. At the very least, more American troops would relieve veteran soldiers subjected to dangerously long tour duties and time away from their families. In addition to the plan's obvious strategic advantages, the moral value of allowing skilled immigrants to gain citizenship and hopefully create better lives for themselves and their families is immeasurable. Right now, there are immigrants who are ready and willing to serve their adopted country -- volunteering in a time of war no less, with a real threat of harm, when the average American citizen (in fact, an overwhelming number of Americans) is more than happy to sit on the sidelines. This is a much easier, much more worthwhile path to citizenship than any proposed by Congress, one with positives that far outweigh any negatives, and we've decided to simply sit on it. There is no doubt: the federal government enjoys working at a snail's pace. It loves to start crucially important reforms and then decide to take an absurd amount of time finishing them (health care anyone?). It has failed to promptly deliver results when they are most needed, as in the case of the bungled response to Hurricane Katrina. And it is far too common for the government to put pressing initiatives on the back burner and never return to them. But having skilled personnel in our military, now more than ever, is of critical importance.<br />
Temporary to permanent is a citizen incentive<br />
Anderson, January 2011 (Stuart - adjunct scholar at the Cato Institute, U.S. Immigration Reform Should Focus on Improving the Employment-Based Visa System, Immigration Reform Bulletin, p. 1)<br />
The first important distinction to under-stand in our immigration system is the difference between (1) receiving temporary status (see Table 1) and (2) gaining lawful permanent residence, sometimes known as receiving one’s “green card” (see Table 2). An employee in temporary status or on a temporary visa (also known as a “nonimmi-grant” visa) can stay in the United States for a period of time but is not entitled to remain permanently or become a U.S. citizen. In contrast, a worker who receives permanent residence (a green card) can remain in the United States for the rest of his or her life (barring long absences or certain criminal convictions) and can become eligible for U.S. citizenship. 1<br />
Targeting temporary visa holders provides the military with thousands of untapped quality recruits. An offer of a green card will provide a strong incentive for participation<br />
Preston, 2/14/2009 (Julia, U.S. Military Will Offer Path to Citizenship, New York Times, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/15/us/15immig.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/15/us/15immig.html</a>)<br />
The military does not allow illegal immigrants to enlist, and that policy would not change, officers said. Recruiting officials pointed out that volunteers with temporary visas would have already passed a security screening and would have shown that they had no criminal record. “The Army will gain in its strength in human capital,” General Freakley said, “and the immigrants will gain their citizenship and get on a ramp to the American dream.” In recent years, as American forces faced combat in two wars and recruiters struggled to meet their goals for the all-volunteer military, thousands of legal immigrants with temporary visas who tried to enlist were turned away because they lacked permanent green cards, recruiting officers said. Recruiters’ work became easier in the last few months as unemployment soared and more Americans sought to join the military. But the Pentagon, facing a new deployment of 30,000 troops to Afghanistan, still has difficulties in attracting doctors, specialized nurses and language experts. Several types of temporary work visas require college or advanced degrees or professional expertise, and immigrants who are working as doctors and nurses in the United States have already been certified by American medical boards. Military figures show that only 82 percent of about 80,000 Army recruits last year had high school diplomas. According to new figures, the Army provided waivers to 18 percent of active-duty recruits in the final four months of last year, allowing them to enlist despite medical conditions or criminal records. Military officials want to attract immigrants who have native knowledge of languages and cultures that the Pentagon considers strategically vital. The program will also be open to students and refugees. The Army’s one-year pilot program will begin in New York City to recruit about 550 temporary immigrants who speak one or more of 35 languages, including Arabic, Chinese, Hindi, Igbo (a tongue spoken in Nigeria), Kurdish, Nepalese, Pashto, Russian and Tamil. Spanish speakers are not eligible. The Army’s program will also include about 300 medical professionals to be recruited nationwide. Recruiting will start after Department of Homeland Security officials update an immigration rule in coming days. Pentagon officials expect that the lure of accelerated citizenship will be powerful. Under a statute invoked in 2002 by the Bush administration, immigrants who serve in the military can apply to become citizens on the first day of active service, and they can take the oath in as little as six months. For foreigners who come to work or study in the United States on temporary visas, the path to citizenship is uncertain and at best agonizingly long, often lasting more than a decade. The military also waives naturalization fees, which are at least $675. To enlist, temporary immigrants will have to prove that they have lived in the United States for two years and have not been out of the country for longer than 90 days during that time. They will have to pass an English test. Language experts will have to serve four years of active duty, and health care professionals will serve three years of active duty or six years in the Reserves. If the immigrants do not complete their service honorably, they could lose their citizenship.<br />

<span class="Underline">A highly successful program by the armed forces to recruit skilled immigrants who live in this country temporarily has run into a roadblock, leaving thousands of potential recruits in limbo. The Army stopped accepting applications for the program last week, officials said Thursday, because the Pentagon had not completed a review required to keep the recruitment going. The program, which started as a pilot in February, allowed recruiters to enlist immigrants, most of them in the Army, with special language or medical skills who are in this country on temporary visas. Successful recruits are offered the chance to become United States citizens within a few months. More than 1,000 immigrants have been enlisted through the program, and hundreds more, at least, are in the final stages of approval, Army officials said. More than 14,000 immigrants have contacted Army recruiters to see if they qualified for the program and have passed a first level of vetting, the officials said.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">Los Angeles Times, 11/30/2010 (Army seeks recruits who talk the talk, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.bendbulletin.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20101130/NEWS0107/11300390/1159&amp;nav_category=" rel="nofollow">http://www.bendbulletin.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20101130/NEWS0107/11300390/1159&amp;nav_category=</a>)</span><br />
<span class="Underline">As the United States continues its military shift from Iraq to Afghanistan, the recruitment of Army translators and interpreters has followed, and Zamani, a contractor who recruits for the Army, is among those who have fanned out to Afghan and Persian communities and shopping districts looking for potential linguists to help fight the war. The recruitment trail can be challenging. The pool of candidates who speak Dari, Pashto or Farsi is far thinner than the Arabic speakers the military sought out during the Iraq war. And many in the communities have reservations about the war. The Army has been able to sign up only nine Los Angeles-area recruits for the language program in the last year, far short of the goal of 48 local enlistees and just a fraction of the 250 signed nationwide. “It’s a much smaller population. ... We’re involved in a lot of community liaison activities and I expect this year to do more than in years past,” said Lt. Col. Frank Demith, assistant deputy for foreign language and culture for the Army. “It’s much harder to recruit.” The Army’s projected shortage of translators comes at a time when the need is most crucial — as the U.S. ramps up preparing an Afghan police, army and justice system and meeting with local councils in preparation for an eventual U.S. withdrawal. Earlier this month, NATO leaders set a goal of 2014 to transfer security responsibilities to the Afghan government — a longer timeline than initially thought — as alliance forces increasingly focus on training, advising and logistics, areas in which specialized linguists are critical. “You’re not simply looking for language, you’re looking for expertise, you’re looking for people who can operate in combat zones, you’re looking for people who can work with local officials,” said Anthony Cordesman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Once enlisted, recruits go through basic training, though when deployed their names are not stitched onto their uniforms for security reasons. Some are quickly shipped to Afghanistan; others — especially women — remain stateside to train soldiers preparing to deploy. On the front lines, translators often accompany commanders and high-level officials to meetings with Afghan governors and leaders. Sometimes their value goes beyond simple translations. One soldier, who asked not to be identified because of security risks, recounted interceding when he saw U.S. soldiers shooting toward a mountain pass in Afghanistan during target practice. The soldier, who had grown up in the area, knew there was a village on the other side of the mountains and believes he probably prevented casualties. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">There is a shortage of coalition trainers for the ANA. Without more trainers by July, the ANA will be ineffective</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Government Accountability Office, January 2011 (Afghanistan Security - Afghan Army Growing, but Additional Trainers Needed, p. 25-28)</span><br />
<span class="Underline">The ANA continues to experience shortages in coalition personnel needed to provide training and assist in its development.25 These include shortfalls in instructors needed at ANA training facilities, as well as a shortage of training teams needed to develop the skills of army units once they are fielded. NTM-A/CSTC-A documentation specifies that 1,495 instructors are needed to train the ANA as it grows to 171,600.26 However, as of November 2010, about 18 percent (275 of 1,495) of instructor positions were unfilled and lacked pledges to fill them, as shown in figure 10. Furthermore, out of instructor positions that NTM-A/CSTC-A has identified as critical priorities, about 36 percent (101 of 281) were unfilled and lacked pledges. Officials with NTM-A/CSTC-A and the U.S. Mission to NATO cited several causes for the shortage of instructors, including low levels of political support for the Afghan mission in some NATO countries and the potential difficulty of financially supporting a troop presence abroad during the current global economic downturn. While the United States has deployed additional forces to temporarily alleviate the shortage in instructors for the ANA, these efforts do not fully address the ANA’s instructor shortage. NTM-A/CSTC-A documentation notes that, due to the presence of additional U.S. personnel, the ANA’s average instructor-to-trainee ratio in basic training improved from about 1 instructor for every 79 trainees as of November 2009 to approximately 1 instructor for every 24 trainees as of November 2010—a key factor, according to NTM-A/CSTC-A, in improved marksmanship qualification rates among ANA trainees. (Fig. 11 shows one such U.S. soldier providing marksmanship training to ANA recruits.) However, according to NTM-A/CSTC-A, while U.S. forces on temporary deployment have improved the quality of ANA basic training, these personnel were not intended to provide instruction in the advanced skills that the ANA must acquire by the time it grows to 171,600.27 Similarly, a November 2010 NTM-A/CSTC-A document noted a particularly serious shortage in the number of instructors needed to teach the ANA specialized skills and stated that unless critical instructor positions are filled between December 2010 and July 2011, the ability of the ANA to develop skills it needs to start assuming lead responsibility for Afghanistan’s security may be delayed. The ANA is also facing shortfalls in coalition training teams needed to develop the skills of new army units once they are fielded. According to NTM-A/CSTC-A, field-based training of the ANA is vital given that army forces completing unit training have limited capability. For example, NTM-A/CSTC-A data indicate that of the first 12 new ANA units fielded since the adoption of the new capability assessment system, 11 were assessed as either dependent on coalition forces for success or ineffective. Given the generally low level of capability that ANA units have upon completing unit training, NTM-A/CSTC-A officials stated that they expect newly formed units to receive substantial training in the field from training teams and partner units. However, shortages exist in the number of training teams available to assist in ANA development. NTM-A/CSTC-A documentation specifies that a total of 205 training teams are needed to complete fielding of a 171,600-person ANA by October 2011. However, as of September 2010, the total number of training teams fielded or pledged by coalition nations was 164—41 fewer than the number needed. According to IJC, given the serious challenges that the ANA faces, the ability of army units to develop greater capability will be delayed if they lack training teams to provide field-based training.</span><br />

Military action is only a part of the strategy needed to win in Afghanistan, but no other effort towards victory will matter if the Afghan people cannot be given enough security and stability to allow successful governance, the opportunity for development, and an established civil society and rule of law that meets Afghan needs and expectations. The creation of more effective host country forces is critical to achieving these ends. NATO/ISAF and US forces cannot hope to win a military victory on their own. Their success will be determined in large part by how well and how quickly they build up a much larger and more effective Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) first to support NATO/ISAF efforts, then take the lead, and eventually replace NATO/ISAF and US forces.</span><br />
<span class="Underline">A stable police force provides stability and legitimacy to the government</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Ladwig III, July 2007 (Walter C. - pre-doctoral fellow at the Miller Center of Public Affairs, Training Foreign Police, Comparative Strategy, p. informaworld)</span><br />
<span class="Underline">In a government's counterinsurgency efforts, the armed forces, police, and auxiliary units that make up a state's security forces play a dual role: they are the sword and the shield of the state. On the one hand, they employ force to disrupt and harry the insurgents. On the other hand, they protect the populace and produce a space in which the political, economic, and social programs of the government can take root. This latter role is arguably the more important of the two. Without adequate security and protection of the population, the longer term efforts to win popular support will fail. As Paget points out: Firstly, the Government must demonstrate its determination and its ability to defeat the insurgents, for no one likes backing a loser, particularly in an insurgency. Secondly, the Government must convince the population that it can and will protect its supporters against the insurgents, for no one likes being shot as a reward for loyalty.7 Security of the populace is the most fundamental requirement for legitimate governance. Without security, there is no foundation on which to build societal allegiance. Under such circumstances, human rights, rule of law, and civil liberties remain a pipe dream. The government agency best suited to disrupt insurgent networks while protecting the population is the local police. Detecting and severing the links between insurgent groups and the civilian supporters they rely on for shelter, transport, and information requires solid investigatory police work. The police are a part of normal civil society in a way that the military is not: They live and work among the local population and interact with civilians on a regular basis. As a result, their local knowledge and connections are a key source of the human intelligence so critical for successful counterinsurgency operations. As Kalev Sepp, an unconventional warfare specialist at the Naval Postgraduate School, has noted: “Intelligence operations that help detect terrorist insurgents for arrest and prosecution are the single most important practice to protect a population from threats to its security. Honest, trained, robust police forces responsible for security can gather intelligence at the community level.”8 The local knowledge that members of a police force possess can help them distinguish between innocents and insurgents. Furthermore, they have experience in regularly dealing with civilians as well as achieving their missions using the minimum amount of necessary force—which the regular military does not. That makes them less likely to alienate the public when carrying out internal security duties.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">Immigrants and their offspring are important potential recruits for the U.S. armed forces. The war against terrorism has forced the United States to become engaged either directly or indirectly in environments where language skills, cultural knowledge, and the ability to work with local populations are vital ingredients of military success.137 Recruiting within the diverse immigrant populations of the United States is the most promising avenue for the armed forces to build up those capabilities. Yet policy restrictions have generally prevented recruiting anyone living in the United States who is not either a citizen or a green-card holder, even though there are now millions of potential immigrants, and their children, living here for long periods in temporary status. One particularly promising pool of recruits includes the many young people whose parents are living in the United States on temporary work visas. Ordinarily, these young people lose their nonimmigrant status at age twenty-one unless they secure student or work visas. Yet often these young people have spent many years in America and have been educated here. Military service should be but is now largely not an option for them. Similarly, though the United States has a history in wartime of recruiting noncitizens abroad who can make valuable contributions to the armed forces, and offering them a quicker path to U.S. citizenship, that authority has not been used in recent conflicts. This makes particular sense for individuals who speak languages desperately needed to help the military in current conflicts (Arabic, Pashto, and so on) and who have already demonstrated their loyalty by working closely with the United States during those missions. These unnecessary restrictions work against U.S. security interests. The government has recently launched a pilot project to recruit up to one thousand people in lawful status, but has limited the pool to those with specialized medical or language skills. The Task Force recommends that the administration permit a broader recruiting effort by the armed forces among noncitizens, with appropri- ate security safeguards. The U.S. armed forces should be allowed to recruit individuals who have lived in the United States for at least two years in some form of nonimmigrant status, as well as a limited number of foreign citizens who have provided exceptional service to the U.S. armed forces abroad. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Imagine you are a Soldier in Iraq or Afghanistan. Wouldn't you feel safer if your combat leader was a linguist and conversant with local customs? What if your company's intelligence was provided by an illiterate? What if your best translator was someone the locals despised or considered to be a spy? How can we distinguish between the respected, the thugs, the honest, or the dregs of a foreign society, if we cannot understand what they say to us? We Americans have a cultural bias against learning languages other than English, but now our Soldiers' lives depend on our doing so. How accurately and well we analyze the indigenous people we deal with during the Global War on Terrorism might well determine the success or failure of counterinsurgency operations. Our combat training will be for nothing if our linguist does not tell us the truth or fails to recognize it because of a lack of training. A lack of foreign language skills is our Army's Achilles' heel. Timeliness and accuracy is everything in intelligence, and thus, a linguist's skills are more important than firepower. With the former, you might not need the latter. Foreign language skills are mission-essential for an expeditionary army. Our Soldiers die in foreign lands because American comrades they can absolutely trust lack those skills. We forget that our job is to move, shoot, and communicate, and we forget that &quot;communicate&quot; does not refer just to radios. When we conduct a raid and find no one there, what was the cause? Was the intelligence bad? Did we give the mission away because of poor operations security? Were we led to the wrong target? Were we too late in getting there? Was the enemy tipped off that we were coming? Is it possible our linguist missed a critical nuance because of his lack of skill? Where should the damage assessment begin? Who knew the truth? And who translated it for him? For Want of a Language Pham Xuan An, who wrote for Time, was a Communist spy during the Vietnam War. Erudite, witty, and insightful, he was said to be a pleasure to deal with. Ideologically motivated, he worked to destroy us. At the other extreme is the Iraqi who makes a separate peace because if he does not, the enemy will kill his family. Both types of spies (for the lack of a better word) gain access to our plans because they are skilled in our language and we are ignorant of theirs. The way into the American fortress is through the open gate of language. No traitor betrays us; our lack of training does. Platoon leaders and operations center chiefs rely on linguists. Linguists are the interpreters on the streets for our patrols and the translators of recently recovered documents. For better or worse, we rely on who is available when we deploy. Army officials predicted a need for hundreds of Arabic speakers before Operation Iraqi Freedom. The Army ended up with 42. We deployed 140,000 troops to Iraq with 42 interpreters!</span><br />

<span class="Underline">“I didn’t know any Arabic and I realized it was almost essential in winning the hearts and minds of the people,” said Cleveland, who will be deployed to Afghanistan in the next few months. This time around, with a basic level of conversational language skills in her arsenal, Cleveland hopes the operation in Afghanistan will be different. “If I at least know the language and culture, I’ll be able to establish relationships with the Afghan people.” Gen. Stanley McChrystal’s call last November for more soldiers on the ground with language capabilities under the “Campaign Continuity” initiative is expected to enhance the Army’s ability to partner with Afghan National Security Forces and local Afghan communities. McChrystal, who commands all Afghanistan war operations, says his goal is to have one leader in every platoon who will interact with the Afghan population. We’re talking more than “hello’s” and “thank yous.” The concept calls for building rapport with Afghan nationals by engaging them in meaningful conversations. “We didn’t take this approach in the first years of the present conflicts,” said Payne. “We went in with the idea we’d overthrow the governments and ‘Gee, it would be great.’ We had no training going in, and when the next phase hit, we weren’t prepared.” Col. Danial D. Pick, the commandant for DLI, said McChrystal’s directive has ushered in a much-needed sea change. “This might be the most systematic and intense language training provided to army units,” said Pick, “and it’s necessary in winning the war in Afghanistan.” But complex is always the keyword in a conversation on Afghanistan. The country’s terrain is as varied as its ethno-linguistic populations, with more languages and dialects than in Iraq. Pick notes Dari and Pashto only truly came on the linguistic radar after 9/11 and sustaining access to high quality translators and interpreters has been more tenuous – both in America and in Afghanistan — than in previous wars. And with a fabled history of invaders stretching back to Alexander the Great, Afghans are traditionally suspect of foreigners. “We’re still trying to figure out the best ways to tap human capital in Afghanistan,” said Pick. The linguistic development of troops isn’t a skill that can be taught overnight. “Commanders have to give us a valuable resource – time,” said Sgt. 1st Class Brian Lamar, the school’s spokesman. “And sometimes that’s difficult when you only have six months of training before deployment and you have Joe Private who doesn’t really know much about Afghanistan.” A soldier in a war like Afghanistan that once seemed like a cakewalk, doesn’t just dodge bullets. He or she attends Shuras and talks to village elders about governance, economics, and security. And when dealing with counterinsurgency doctrine under McChrystal’s direction, no training is more crucial to the military than education in critical languages and cultures. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">The global stakes could not be higher in the forthcoming decision by the administration about the future course of action in Afghanistan. If Washington ditches its counterinsurgency course here, it will deliver a blow to similar U.S. and Western counterinsurgency doctrines worldwide. Counterinsurgency tactics have been successful in keeping the lid on budding low-intensity conflicts around the world. Compared to conventional wars they are low-budget and low- or no-U.S. casualty affairs. The U.S. supplies training, equipment, arms, guidance and financial support. But indigenous forces take the lead in combating terrorists and insurgents and in creating better societies with less neglect of marginalized groups who often provide recruits for terrorism. Allowing the domestic security forces to take the credit, U.S. special operations forces help in refurbishing mosques, building schools, digging wells and staffing medical and veterinary clinics. Currently, the United States has about 600 Special Operations Forces in the Mindanao, a southern island in the Philippine archipelago. These troops and others assist the Armed Forces of the Philippines in combatting Abu Sayyaf, a terrorist movement founded, in part, by Osama bin Laden’s brother-in-law and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, a violent separatist group. Over the past near-decade, Washington has also provided some $500-million in aid to Manila for reconstruction projects in southern islands. Without the American military and financial help, the radical movements would have carved out sanctuaries, breeding terrorists to threaten the United States. On the other side of the globe in the Horn of Africa, the Pentagon stood up a command structure just after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Operating out of a former French military post in Djibouti, some 1,800 U.S. troops conduct lethal attacks on such wanted terrorists as Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan, who was killed by helicopter-borne missiles in Somalia last month. Nabhan had headed an al-Qaeda-affiliated cell, which struck a resort in Mombasa, Kenya, in 2002. Gaining intelligence from local sources, the U.S. killed Nabhan and several other militants in an attack that avoided civilian deaths. But American forces also perform much non-lethal work in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania and Djibouti to pre-empt insurgencies from developing. Across the Gulf of Aden, U.S. special forces are training Yemen’s troops in counterinsurgency tactics to arrest a spreading insurgency in the country’s northern belt along the border with Saudi Arabia. In Pakistan, American forces are engaged in training missions to help the Pakistani military confront a series of Taliban insurgent movements in the nation’s northern zones. In these countries, as well as others, the Pentagon has deployed small U.S. units to train local armies in counterinsurgency techniques similar to those being instituted in Afghanistan. The units’ success is due to skill and the low-visibility of their presence. They also demonstrate that the McChrystal strategy will work, once enough troops are in place to reduce the rural violence allowing the non-lethal efforts to take root. Pulling the rug out from the U.S. counterinsurgency in Afghanistan would, in time, lead to the jettisoning of similar anti-insurgent programs. Since al-Qaeda and its franchises have already pledged to open new safe havens or “fronts” in remote regions to defeat the United States, we need effective counter-measures to prevent or defeat such a stratagem. Al-Qaeda was beaten in Iraq, which it declared the central front against America in 2006, by similar counterinsurgency tactics to those being pressed in Afghanistan. By backing a winning counterinsurgency in Afghanistan, the United States will go a long way in defeating militant insurgents around the world. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">The second vital interest concerns the stability of Pakistan. The United States cannot allow Pakistan’s nuclear weapons to fall into the hands of violent extremist organizations or any other enemy of the United States.8 Accordingly, the United States supports a strong Pakistani state capable of maintaining control of both its nuclear arsenal and its territory, particularly from internal threats. The outcome of events in neighboring Afghanistan will play a key role in the ultimate stability of the Pakistani state. A return to Afghan civil war could embolden Pakistan’s own internal insurgency, potentially undermining Pakistan’s fragile stability.9 Important U.s. Interests The United States has many other interests in Afghanistan, Pakistan and the surrounding region. The most important of these interests is regional stability: A war between India and Pakistan, two nuclear-armed nations, or the spread of destabilizing Islamist insurgencies to the states of Central Asia would be disastrous. Further, state failure in Pakistan – owing to financial crisis, popular unrest or insurgent disruption – could upend the region’s fragile balance of power in potentially catastrophic ways. A Taliban return to control in Afghanistan would energize the global jihadist movement, motivate insurgent groups in Pakistan and across the region, endanger democracy and human rights in Afghanistan and deal a blow to widely held standards of freedom and justice in the region and around the world. An Afghan civil war fought by proxies of regional neighbors could also prove a destabilizing and bloody outcome of a precipitate U.S. departure. While U.S. support for human rights in both Afghanistan and Pakistan is an important interest, it is not a vital one. The United States has been a powerful advocate for human rights across the globe, but it has rarely intervened militarily to protect them. The same can be said for countering the spread of illicit narcotics. This strategy clearly recognizes risks to these important but not vital interests. The way in which the United States deals with Afghanistan – its first conflict of the 21st century – will be studied across the globe for any portent of a decline in U.S. power. Will the United States abandon its friends when things get tough? Can the powerful U.S. military be defeated by insur- gent extremists fighting a prolonged or irregular war? Is the United States going to play a major role in the resource-rich economies of Central and South Asia, or will it cede the region to other powers and return to a post-Cold War idyll that ignores the region entirely? These questions will be asked by rivals of the United States such as Iran and China as well as by U.S. allies in the region. While perceptions of U.S. power today may prove ephemeral tomorrow, an Internet-savvy, ideologi- cally based jihadist network with global reach and aspirations might leverage a wholesale U.S. disengagement from Afghanistan to fuel a compel- ling narrative of revolution that would serve as a useful recruiting tool. The second-order effects of the next U.S. choices in Afghanistan should not be underestimated.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">A nuclear war between India and Pakistan could cause one billion people to starve to death around the world, and hundreds of millions more to die from disease and conflicts over food. That is the horrifying scenario being presented in London today by a US medical expert, Ira Helfand. A conference at the Royal Society of Medicine will also hear new evidence of the severe damage that such a war could inflict on the ozone layer. &quot;A limited nuclear war taking place far away poses a threat that should concern everyone on the planet,&quot; Helfand told New Scientist. This was not scare mongering, he adds: &quot;It is appropriate, given the data, to be frightened.&quot; Helfand is an emergency-room doctor in Northampton, Massachusetts, US, and a co-founder of the US anti-nuclear group, Physicians for Social Responsibility. In his study he attempted to map out the global consequences of India and Pakistan exploding 100 Hiroshima-sized nuclear warheads. Global hoarding Earlier studies have suggested that such a conflict would throw five million tonnes of black soot into the atmosphere, triggering a reduction of 1.25°C in the average temperature at the earth's surface for several years. As a result, the annual growing season in the world's most important grain-producing areas would shrink by between 10 and 20 days. Helfand points out that the world is ill-prepared to cope with such a disaster. &quot;Global grain stocks stand at 49 days, lower than at any point in the past five decades,&quot; he says. &quot;These stocks would not provide any significant reserve in the event of a sharp decline in production. We would see hoarding on a global scale.&quot; Countries which import more than half of their grain, such as Malaysia, South Korea and Taiwan, would be particularly vulnerable, Helfand argues. So, too, would 150 million people in north Africa, which imports 45% of its food. Many of the 800 million around the world who are already officially malnourished would also suffer. Large-scale impacts on food supplies from global cooling are credible because they have happened before, Helfand says. The eruption of the Indonesian volcano Tambora in 1815 produced the &quot;year without a summer&quot; in 1816, causing one of the worst famines of the 19th century. Mass starvation The global death toll from a nuclear war in Asia &quot;could exceed one billion from starvation alone&quot;, Helfand concludes. Food shortages could also trigger epidemics of cholera, typhus and other diseases, as well as armed conflicts, which together could kill &quot;hundreds of millions&quot;. Another study being unveiled at today's conference suggests that the smoke unleashed by 100, small, 15 kiloton nuclear warheads could destroy 30-40% of the world's ozone layer. This would kill off some food crops, according to the study's author, Brian Toon, an atmospheric scientist from the University of Colorado in Boulder, US. The smoke would warm the stratosphere by up to 50°C, accelerating the natural reactions that attack ozone, he says. &quot;No-one has ever thought about this before,&quot; he adds, &quot;I think there is a potential for mass starvation.&quot; Such dire predictions are not dismissed by nuclear experts, though they stress the large uncertainties involved. The fallout from a nuclear war between India and Pakistan &quot;would be far more devastating for other countries than generally appreciated,&quot; says John Pike, director of the US think tank, globalsecurity.org. &quot;Local events can have global consequences.&quot; Dan Plesch from the University of London's School of Oriental and African Studies, agrees that everyone is at risk from a limited nuclear war. &quot;We live in a state of denial that our fate can be determined by decisions in Islamabad and New Delhi as much as in Washington and Moscow,&quot; he says. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Iranian adventurism sparks nuclear war</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Ben-Meir, 2/6/2007 (Alon – professor of international relations at the Center for Global Affairs, Ending iranian defiance, United Press International, p. lexis)</span><br />
<span class="Underline">That Iran stands today able to challenge or even defy the United States in every sphere of American influence in the Middle East attests to the dismal failure of the Bush administration's policy toward it during the last six years. Feeling emboldened and unrestrained, Tehran may, however, miscalculate the consequences of its own actions, which could precipitate a catastrophic regional war. The Bush administration has less than a year to rein in Iran's reckless behavior if it hopes to prevent such an ominous outcome and achieve, at least, a modicum of regional stability. By all assessments, Iran has reaped the greatest benefits from the Iraq war. The war's consequences and the American preoccupation with it have provided Iran with an historic opportunity to establish Shiite dominance in the region while aggressively pursuing a nuclear weapon program to deter any challenge to its strategy. Tehran is fully cognizant that the successful pursuit of its regional hegemony has now become intertwined with the clout that a nuclear program bestows. Therefore, it is most unlikely that Iran will give up its nuclear ambitions at this juncture, unless it concludes that the price will be too high to bear. That is, whereas before the Iraq war Washington could deal with Iran's nuclear program by itself, now the Bush administration must also disabuse Iran of the belief that it can achieve its regional objectives with impunity. Thus, while the administration attempts to stem the Sunni-Shiite violence in Iraq to prevent it from engulfing other states in the region, Washington must also take a clear stand in Lebanon. Under no circumstances should Iranian-backed Hezbollah be allowed to topple the secular Lebanese government. If this were to occur, it would trigger not only a devastating civil war in Lebanon but a wider Sunni-Shiite bloody conflict. The Arab Sunni states, especially, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Jordan, are terrified of this possible outcome. For them Lebanon may well provide the litmus test of the administration's resolve to inhibit Tehran's adventurism but they must be prepared to directly support U.S. efforts. In this regard, the Bush administration must wean Syria from Iran. This move is of paramount importance because not only could Syria end its political and logistical support for Hezbollah, but it could return Syria, which is predominantly Sunni, to the Arab-Sunni fold. President Bush must realize that Damascus' strategic interests are not compatible with Tehran's and the Assad regime knows only too well its future political stability and economic prosperity depends on peace with Israel and normal relations with the United States. President Bashar Assad may talk tough and embrace militancy as a policy tool; he is, however, the same president who called, more than once, for unconditional resumption of peace negotiation with Israel and was rebuffed. The stakes for the United States and its allies in the region are too high to preclude testing Syria's real intentions which can be ascertained only through direct talks. It is high time for the administration to reassess its policy toward Syria and begin by abandoning its schemes of regime change in Damascus. Syria simply matters; the administration must end its efforts to marginalize a country that can play such a pivotal role in changing the political dynamic for the better throughout the region. Although ideally direct negotiations between the United States and Iran should be the first resort to resolve the nuclear issue, as long as Tehran does not feel seriously threatened, it seems unlikely that the clergy will at this stage end the nuclear program. In possession of nuclear weapons Iran will intimidate the larger Sunni Arab states in the region, bully smaller states into submission, threaten Israel's very existence, use oil as a political weapon to blackmail the West and instigate regional proliferation of nuclear weapons' programs. In short, if unchecked, Iran could plunge the Middle East into a deliberate or inadvertent nuclear conflagration. If we take the administration at its word that it would not tolerate a nuclear Iran and considering these regional implications, Washington is left with no choice but to warn Iran of the severe consequences of not halting its nuclear program.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">Patrick Speice, JD, 2006, William &amp; Mary Law Review, February, p. 1437-8</span><br />
<span class="Underline">The potential consequences of the unchecked spread of nuclear knowledge and material to terrorist groups that seek to cause mass destruction in the United States are truly horrifying. A terrorist attack with a nuclear weapon would be devastating in terms of immediate human and economic losses. Moreover, there would be immense political pressure in the United States to discover the perpetrators and retaliate with nuclear weapons, massively increasing the number of casualties and potentially triggering a full-scale nuclear conflict. In addition to the threat posed by terrorists, leakage of nuclear knowledge and material from Russia will reduce the barriers that states with nuclear ambitions face and may trigger widespread proliferation of nuclear weapons. This proliferation will increase the risk of nuclear attacks against the United States or its allies by hostile states, as well as increase the likelihood that regional conflicts will draw in the United States and escalate to the use of nuclear weapons.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">At the moment, al Qaeda is judged to be the sole terrorist group actively intent on conducting a nuclear attack against the United States. For the foreseeable future, no extremists or groups to which they belong will be able on their own to produce nuclear weapons–usable materials. As a result, terrorists can successfully employ a nuclear device only if they acquire a weapon or weapons-usable materials from a state nuclear program. It is therefore imperative that authorities secure nuclear weapons and materials at their source. Al Qaeda began its efforts to acquire nuclear weapons–usable material in the early 1990s. While bin Laden was living in Sudan, his aides received word that a Sudanese military officer was offering to sell weapons-grade uranium. Bin Laden was willing to pay full price for the material: $1.5 million. After the purchase, however, the al Qaeda members realized that they had been scammed. This failure apparently did not discourage bin Laden—and his persistence highlights the seriousness of his interest. In the spring of 2001, bin Laden met with a Pakistani former nuclear scientist, Bashiruddin Mahmood, and discussed the development of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction. Today, all of this still points to intent but not capability. U.S. government officials and recognized experts have testified that al Qaeda probably does not currently have the nuclear materials or the technical expertise necessary to produce a nuclear weapon. However, they also recognize that the terrorists’ ability to produce such a device could increase dramatically should they recruit just one or two individuals with access to nuclear materials or with knowledge of nuclear weapons designs. </span><br />

In the former Yugoslavia nationalist aggression tears at the stability of Europe and could easily spread. The flow of illegal drugs intensifies through increasingly powerful international crime syndicates that have made common cause with authoritarian regimes and have utterly corrupted the institutions of tenuous, democratic ones. Nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons continue to proliferate. The very source of life on Earth, the global ecosystem, appears increasingly endangered. Most of these new and unconventional threats to security are associated with or aggravated by the weakness or absence of democracy, with its provisions for legality, accountability, popular sovereignty, and openness. LESSONS OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY The experience of this century offers important lessons. Countries that govern themselves in a truly democratic fashion do not go to war with one another. They do not aggress against their neighbors to aggrandize themselves or glorify their leaders. Democratic governments do not ethnically &quot;cleanse&quot; their own populations, and they are much less likely to face ethnic insurgency. Democracies do not sponsor terrorism against one another. They do not build weapons of mass destruction to use on or to threaten one another. Democratic countries form more reliable, open, and enduring trading partnerships. In the long run they offer better and more stable climates for investment. They are more environmentally responsible because they must answer to their own citizens, who organize to protest the destruction of their environments. They are better bets to honor international treaties since they value legal obligations and because their openness makes it much more difficult to breach agreements in secret. Precisely because, within their own borders, they respect competition, civil liberties, property rights, and the rule of law, democracies are the only reliable foundation on which a new world order of international security and prosperity can be built.</span><br />

With Saudi Arabia already at war in northern yemen and the country increasingly at risk of becoming a haven for transnational terrorists, the United States must actively work to avoid the potentially dire consequences of a failing state there.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">Meanwhile, the existence of an arsenal of mass destruction in such an unstable region in turn has serious implications for future arms control and disarmament negotiations, and even the threat of nuclear war. Seymour Hersh warns, &quot;Should war break out in the Middle East again,... or should any Arab nation fire missiles against Israel, as the Iraqis did, a nuclear escalation, once unthinkable except as a last resort, would now be a strong probability.&quot; and Ezar Weissman, Israel's current President said &quot;The nuclear issue is gaining momentum(and the) next war will not be conventional.&quot; Russia and before it the Soviet Union has long been a major(if not the major) target of Israeli nukes. It is widely reported that the principal purpose of Jonathan Pollard's spying for Israel was to furnish satellite images of Soviet targets and other super sensitive data relating to U.S. nuclear targeting strategy. (Since launching its own satellite in 1988, Israel no longer needs U.S. spy secrets.) Israeli nukes aimed at the Russian heartland seriously complicate disarmament and arms control negotiations and, at the very least, the unilateral possession of nuclear weapons by Israel is enormously destabilizing, and dramatically lowers the threshold for their actual use, if not for all out nuclear war. In the words of Mark Gaffney, &quot;... if the familiar pattern(Israel refining its weapons of mass destruction with U.S. complicity) is not reversed soon- for whatever reason- the deepening Middle East conflict could trigger a world conflagration.&quot;</span><br />

<span class="Underline">Opening the military to immigrants resolves military shortage and provides high-quality recruits</span><br />

<span class="Underline">Now is the time to consider a new chapter in the annals of American immigration. By inviting foreigners to join the U.S. armed forces in exchange for a promise of citizenship after a four-year tour of duty, we could continue to attract some of the world's most enterprising, selfless and talented individuals. We could provide a new path toward assimilation for undocumented immigrants who are already here but lack the prerequisite for enlistment -- a green card. And we could solve the No. 1 problem facing the Army and Marine Corps: the fact that these services need to grow to meet current commitments yet cannot easily do so (absent a draft) given the current recruiting environment. Not only would immigrants provide a valuable influx of highly motivated soldiers, they would also address one of America's key deficiencies in the battle against Islamist extremists: our lack of knowledge of the languages and mores in the lands where terrorists reside. Newly arrived Americans can help us avoid trampling on local sensitivities and thereby creating more enemies than we eliminate. Skeptics might point out that in the just-concluded fiscal year, the military met most of its recruiting and retention goals. But this was done only by relaxing age and aptitude restrictions, allowing in more individuals with criminal records, and greatly increasing the number of recruiters and advertising dollars. Although we generally support what has been done to date, the logic of these measures cannot be pushed much further. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">The Army is lowering recruitment standards to levels not seen in at least two decades, and the implications are severe—not only for the future of the Army, but also for the direction of U.S. foreign policy. The latest statistics—compiled by the Defense Department. and obtained through the Freedom of Information Act by the Boston-based National Priorities Project—are grim. They show that the percentage of new Army recruits with high-school diplomas has plunged from 94 percent in 2003 to 83.5 percent in 2005 to 70.7 percent in 2007. (The Pentagon's longstanding goal is 90 percent.) The percentage of what the Army calls &quot;high-quality&quot; recruits—those who have high-school diplomas and who score in the upper 50th percentile on the Armed Forces' aptitude tests—has declined from 56.2 percent in 2005 to 44.6 percent in 2007. In order to meet recruitment targets, the Army has even had to scour the bottom of the barrel. There used to be a regulation that no more than 2 percent of all recruits could be &quot;Category IV&quot;—defined as applicants who score in the 10th to 30th percentile on the aptitude tests. In 2004, just 0.6 percent of new soldiers scored so low. In 2005, as the Army had a hard time recruiting, the cap was raised to 4 percent. And in 2007, according to the new data, the Army exceeded even that limit—4.1 percent of new recruits last year were Cat IVs. These trends are worrisome in at least four ways. First, and most broadly, it's not a good idea—for a host of social, political, and moral reasons—to place the burdens of national defense so disproportionately on the most downtrodden citizens. Second, and more practically, high-school dropouts tend to drop out of the military, too. The National Priorities Project cites Army studies finding that 80 percent of high-school graduates finish their first terms of enlistment in the Army—compared with only about half of those with a General Equivalency Degree or no diploma. In other words, taking in more dropouts is a short-sighted method of boosting recruitment numbers. The Army will just have to recruit even more young men and women in the next couple of years, because a lot of the ones they recruited last year will need to be replaced. Third, a dumber army is a weaker army. A study by the RAND Corporation, commissioned by the Pentagon and published in 2005, evaluated several factors that affect military performance—experience, training, aptitude, and so forth—and found that aptitude is key. This was true even of basic combat skills, such as shooting straight. Replacing a tank gunner who had scored Category IV with one who'd scored Category IIIA (in the 50th to 64th percentile) improved the chances of hitting a target by 34 percent. Today's Army, of course, is much more high-tech, from top to bottom. The problem is that when tasks get more technical, aptitude makes an even bigger difference. In one Army study cited by the RAND report, three-man teams from the Army's active-duty signal battalions were told to make a communications system operational. Teams consisting of Category IIIA personnel had a 67 percent chance of succeeding. Teams with Category IIIB soldiers (who had ranked in the 31st to 49th percentile) had a 47 percent chance. Those with Category IVs had only a 29 percent chance. The study also showed that adding a high-scoring soldier to a three-man team increased its chance of success by 8 percent. (This also means that adding a low-scoring soldier to a team reduces its chance by a similar margin.) Fourth, today's Army needs particularly bright soldiers—and it needs, even more, to weed out particularly dim ones—given the direction that at least some of its senior officers want it to take. When the Army was geared to fight large-scaled battles against enemies of comparable strength, imaginative thinking wasn't much required except at a command level. However, now that it's focusing on &quot;asymmetric warfare,&quot; especially counterinsurgency campaigns, such as those in Iraq and Afghanistan, the requirements are different. The crucial engagements—in many ways, the crucial decisions—take place in the streets, door to door, not by armored divisions or brigades but by infantry companies and squads. And when the targets include hearts and minds, every soldier's judgment and actions have an impact. The Army's 2006 field manual on counterinsurgency, which was supervised by Gen. David Petraeus (who is now trying to put its principles into action as U.S. commander in Iraq), emphasized that successful counterinsurgency operations &quot;require Soldiers and Marines at every echelon to possess the following&quot;—and then the authors recite a daunting list of prerequisites, including a &quot;clear, nuanced, and empathetic appreciation of the essential nature of the conflict,&quot; an &quot;understanding of the motivation, strengths, and weaknesses of the insurgent,&quot; rudimentary knowledge of the local culture, and several other admirable qualities. Some of the officers and outside specialists who helped Petraeus write the field manual expressed concerns to me, at the time, that the Army—which was just beginning to lower its standards—might not be up to the demands of this kind of warfare. Given that standards have dipped quite dramatically since—and add to that the problems the Army has had in retaining its most talented junior officers—the concerns now must be graver. It's well-known that the Army might not have enough combat troops to conduct sustained counterinsurgency campaigns. Now it seems the problem may soon be about quality as well as quantity (brains as well as boots). The main reason for the decline in standards is the war in Iraq and its onerous &quot;operations tempo&quot;—soldiers going back for third and fourth tours of duty, with no end in sight. This is well understood among senior officers, and it's a major reason why several Army generals favor a faster withdrawal rate. They worry that fewer young men and women—and now it seems fewer smart young men and women—will sign up if doing so means a guaranteed assignment to Iraq. They worry that, if these trends continue, the Army itself will start to crumble. So, there's a double spiral in effect. The war keeps more good soldiers from enlisting. The lack of good candidates compels the Army to recruit more bad candidates. The swelling ranks of ill-suited soldiers make it harder to fight these kinds of wars effectively.</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Shortfalls in recruitment creates a spiral effect that crushes military readiness and emboldens adversaries</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Perry et. al., January 2006 (William- former secretary of defense and senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, The U.S. Military, The National Security Advisory Group, p. 11)</span><br />
<span class="Underline">If recruiting trends do not improve over the next year, the Army – both active and reserve – will experience great difficulty fully manning its planned force structure and providing the needed rotation base for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. A year from now, the combination of fewer than needed recruits and fewer than needed reenlistments in the junior grades could result in a significant “hollowing” and imbalance in the Army, both active and reserve. Based on DoD’s monthly manpower report by grade, the Army already has a deficit of some 18,000 personnel in its junior enlisted grades (E1-E4). Even if it meets its recruiting and retention goals, the Army is projected to be short some 30,000 soldiers (not including stop loss) by the end of FY2006.11 Such a shortfall would force the Army to cannibalize some units in order to fully man others to deploy. This would negatively impact not only the cohesion of the units deploying but also the readiness and usability of those left at home. It would also exacerbate strains on personnel pulled from recently returned units and reassigned to fill out deploying ones. Such manpower shortfalls will also jeopardize aspects of the Army’s plan to transform its division-based structure into modular brigade combat teams – the Army may simply not have enough people to populate its planned force structure. These factors will create tremendous internal pressures to redeploy additional U.S. forces from Iraq by next spring, whatever the conditions on the ground may be. • If retention rates decline significantly, the viability of the All Volunteer force could be threatened. Many observers of the Army and Marine Corps are now waiting for the other shoe – the retention shoe – to drop. The All Volunteer Force is now in historically uncharted waters: fighting a protracted conflict with volunteers rather than draftees. What will happen if the current surge for Iraq becomes the steady state and the Army and Marines are not resourced with the people, units and equipment they need for a long-term fight? When will the dedication and sacrifice of our troops run up against the needs of families and communities? Will they vote with their feet? If they do, what will become of the All Volunteer Force? The conventional wisdom is that while most will stay in the force after one or even two tours, after a third year-long deployment in a compressed time period, many will choose to leave the force. Many senior military officers who lived through the Vietnam era and its aftermath believe that if significant numbers of senior non- commissioned officers and field grade commanders begin to leave the force, this could set off a mass exodus and lead to a “hollowing out” of the Army. • In the meantime, the United States has only limited ground force capability ready to respond to other contingencies. The absence of a credible strategic reserve in our ground forces increases the risk that potential adversaries will be tempted to challenge the United States. Since the end of World War II, a core element of U.S. strategy has been maintaining a military capable of deterring and, if necessary, defeating aggression in more than one theater at a time. As a global power with global interests, the United States must be able to deal with challenges to its interests in multiple regions of the world simultaneously. Today, however, the United States has only limited ground force capability ready to respond outside the Afghan and Iraqi theaters of operations. If the Army were ordered to send significant forces to another crisis today, its only option would be to deploy units at readiness levels far below what operational plans would require – increasing the risk to the men and women being sent into harm’s way and to the success of the mission. As stated rather blandly in one DoD presentation, the Army “continues to accept risk” in its ability to respond to crises on the Korean Peninsula and elsewhere. Although the United States can still deploy air, naval, and other more specialized assets to deter or respond to aggression, the visible overextension of our ground forces has the potential to significantly weaken our ability to deter and respond to some contingencies.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">U.S. military readiness cannot be gauged by comparing America's armed forces with other nations' militaries. Instead, the capability of U.S. forces to support America's national security requirements should be the measure of U.S. military readiness. Such a standard is necessary because America may confront threats from many different nations at once. America's national security requirements dictate that the armed forces must be prepared to defeat groups of adversaries in a given war. America, as the sole remaining superpower, has many enemies. Because attacking America or its interests alone would surely end in defeat for a single nation, these enemies are likely to form alliances. Therefore, basing readiness on American military superiority over any single nation has little saliency. The evidence indicates that the U.S. armed forces are not ready to support America's national security requirements. Moreover, regarding the broader capability to defeat groups of enemies, military readiness has been declining. The National Security Strategy, the U.S. official statement of national security objectives,3 concludes that the United States &quot;must have the capability to deter and, if deterrence fails, defeat large-scale, cross-border aggression in two distant theaters in overlapping time frames.&quot;4 According to some of the military's highest-ranking officials, however, the United States cannot achieve this goal. Commandant of the Marine Corps General James Jones, former Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Jay Johnson, and Air Force Chief of Staff General Michael Ryan have all expressed serious concerns about their respective services' ability to carry out a two major theater war strategy.5 Recently retired Generals Anthony Zinni of the U.S. Marine Corps and George Joulwan of the U.S. Army have even questioned America's ability to conduct one major theater war the size of the 1991 Gulf War.6 Military readiness is vital because declines in America's military readiness signal to the rest of the world that the United States is not prepared to defend its interests. Therefore, potentially hostile nations will be more likely to lash out against American allies and interests, inevitably leading to U.S. involvement in combat. A high state of military readiness is more likely to deter potentially hostile nations from acting aggressively in regions of vital national interest, thereby preserving peace. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">There is a reason that regimes like Iran and North Korea go to the time and expense, and assume the risks of developing nuclear weapons programs; nuclear capability empowers them to achieve their ends, and thereby poses challenges to the United States, for several reasons. First, there is a danger that rogue regimes with nuclear material may assist terrorists in developing weapons of mass destruction.[36] Even the possibility that such regimes may do so gives them leverage internationally. Second, these regimes have ambitions in their regions and around the world.[37] Some of their leaders are fanatical enough to actually consider a first strike using nuclear weapons; for example, high-ranking officials of the Iranian government have openly discussed using a nuclear weapon against Israel.[38] Whether a first strike occurs or not, the possession of nuclear capability frees aggressive regimes to pursue their other goals violently with less fear of retaliation. For example, North Korea’s nuclear capability means that it could attack South Korea conventionally with a measure of impunity; even if the attack failed, the United States and its allies would be less likely to remove the North Korean regime in retaliation. In other words, nuclear capability lessens the penalties which could be exacted on North Korea if it engages in aggression, which makes the aggression more likely. The same logic applies to Iran, which is why the other nations in the Middle East are so concerned about Iran’s nuclear program. A nuclear attack by Iran is possible, but the real danger of Iranian nuclear capability is that it would make conventional aggression in the region more likely.[39] Finally, the more nations that get nuclear weapons, the greater the pressure on other nations to acquire them as a deterrent, and this is particularly true when a government acquiring the capability is seen as unstable or aggressive. North Korea’s possession of nuclear weapons has tended, for obvious reasons, to make the South Koreans and Japanese uncomfortable about having no deterrent themselves. The possibility of uncontrolled proliferation—what experts call a “nuclear cascade”[40]—is tremendously dangerous; it increases the possibility that terrorists can get nuclear material from a national program, and it raises the prospect of a multilateral nuclear confrontation between nations.[41] Many of the smaller nuclear nations do not have well-established first strike doctrine or launch protocols; the chance of a nuclear exchange, accidental or intentional, increases geometrically when a confrontation is multilateral. The antidote to proliferation is American leadership and power. The reality and perception of American strength not only deters aggressive regimes from acquiring weapons of mass destruction; it reassures other countries that they can exist safely under the umbrella of American power without having to develop their own deterrent capability.[42] </span><br />

<span class="Underline">C. THE EMERGENCE OF RUSSIA AND CHINA AS REGIONAL SUPERPOWERS The last few years have seen the reemergence of Russia and China as regional superpowers. Both nations have strong militaries in which they are heavily investing,[43] substantial—and in China’s case—growing economies,[44] demonstrated indifference to human rights,[45] authoritarian regimes that show no signs of becoming democratic and—in Russia’s case—is moving away from democracy,[46] and nationalistic ambitions that are at odds with their neighbors and the United States.[47] Russia and China have been significantly increasing military spending;[48] and unlike the United States, which must pay high manpower costs to sustain a volunteer military, can spend their defense budget mostly on modernizing and procuring their weapons programs.[49] Russia increased military spending by approximately 30% in 2007, 27% in 2006, and 22% in 2005.[50] It is modernizing its submarine fleet and building new short and long-range ballistic missiles. It has highly developed cyber weapon capability,[51] and its army and navy performed far above expectations in the recent invasion of Georgia.[52] The Russians have threatened to use energy as a weapon against Europe and certainly could do so;[53] they control half of the natural gas Europe receives and are promoting an international natural gas cartel similar to OPEC.[54] Russia is building Iran’s nuclear reactor[55] and has systematically obstructed international attempts to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.[56] It has sold sophisticated weapons to Iran,[57] Syria,[58] and Venezuela,[59] and it has long been the source of China’s most sophisticated weaponry, including advanced fighter aircraft and carrier killer supersonic missiles.[60] Russia is controlled by a man—Vladimir Putin—who announced to his Parliament in 2005 that the most tragic event of the 20th century was the collapse of the Soviet Union.[61] China admits to spending approximately $60 billion per year on its military, and to increasing spending by an average of 17% to 18% each year.[62] American intelligence believes that China’s expenditures are actually two to three times higher than it admits.[63] China has money to spend on its armed forces; its economy is growing exponentially, and within the next decade China will have the largest industrial sector in the world.[64] China believes its national interests are served by promoting proliferation, tyranny, and even genocide. It is committing ethnic genocide itself in Tibet,[65] and is supporting genocide in Sudan,[66] oppression in Burma,[67] repression and political terror in Zimbabwe,[68] and nuclear proliferation in North Korea and Iran.[69] China has threatened Taiwan militarily on numerous occasions,[70] and its current military doctrine and procurement policies are aimed at excluding American naval power from the Western Pacific[71] and particularly the Straits of Taiwan.[72] China has an arsenal of submarines armed with carrier killer missiles which it purchased from the Russians,[73] as well as sophisticated fighters;[74] and it is rapidly building up a fleet of modern nuclear submarines, [75] for which it has opened up a base on the island of Hainan.[76] China is ruled by an authoritarian oligarchy that has shown the resiliency to survive the introduction of something like freedom into its economic system. Like Vladimir Putin, the Chinese leaders believe that asserting themselves abroad is a way of unifying their people and stabilizing the regime. In addition, and again like Russia, the Chinese have a history of dominating their part of the world.[77] The Russians and the Chinese have formed a cooperative organization and held unprecedented joint military maneuvers in 2005[78] and again in 2008. They will undoubtedly continue to pursue their national ambitions, particularly in Asia, Eastern Europe, and the former states of the Soviet Union;[79] whether or not they use aggressive tactics depends, as a threshold matter, on their perception of the deterrent strength of the United States. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Chinese perceptions of American power are consequential. China’s assessment of the global structure of power is an important factor in Chinese foreign policy decision-making. As long as Chinese leaders perceive a long-lasting American preeminence, averting confrontation with the United States is likely seen as the best option. If Beijing were to perceive the U.S. position as weakening, there could be fewer inhibitions for China to avoid challenging the United States where American and Chinese interests diverge. Since the late-1990s, Beijing has judged the United States as firmly entrenched in the role of sole superpower. As long as the comprehensive national power of China and the other major powers lagged far behind the United States, and the ability of China to forge coalitions to counterbalance U.S. power remained limited, Beijing concertedly avoided challenging U.S. interests around the world; for example, when the United States invaded Iraq. Yet, China’s recent evaluation that the United States is overextended with wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, coupled with a perceived U.S. weakness in the wake of the financial crisis, could imbue Chinese policy makers with the confidence to be more assertive on the international stage in ways that may be inconsistent with American interests.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">On the active defense side, it appears that China is attempting to import and to build indigenously a fairly impressive layered air defense system to counter cruise missiles and advanced aircraft. In addition to reported clandestine acquisition of Patriot technology, China has purchased and is seeking to purchase from Russia an undisclosed number of SA-10 (S-300) and SA-15 (TOR-1) SAM systems. Some of this Russian technology might be successfully integrated into China's own domestically produced SAM systems, such as the HQ-9. [66] China is also working to develop antistealth and antisatellite capabilities. Even if the Chinese programs have only limited effect against more technologically advanced foes, they may still pose a future security challenge to Taiwan and the United States. If Beijing elites believe that they are in a protracted war of wills over an issue that they care about much more than do the Americans, such as Taiwan, those elites might still be emboldened by the perceived capability--however limited--to increase costs to American and Taiwanese forces and to reduce costs to mainland assets in such a struggle. This problem is only exacerbated by any perceptions that Chinese elites might have about America's supposed limited willingness to fight such protracted wars and to suffer casualties. Implications and Prescriptions for U.S. Strategy If the analysis above is correct, preventing war across the Taiwan Strait and between the United States and China is much more difficult than a straightforward net assessment of relative military power in the region might suggest. To deter China from launching attacks against Taiwan and escalating crises and conflicts by attacking American assets in the region, the United States must do more than demonstrate an ability to prevail militarily in a conflict; it must also demonstrate American resolve and, perhaps, the ability to protect its forces not only from defeat but also from significant harm.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">THE high-intensity scenario postulates a cross-strait war escalating into a full-scale war between the US and China. If Washington were to conclude that splitting China would better serve its national interests, then a full-scale war becomes unavoidable. Conflict on such a scale would embroil other countries far and near and -- horror of horrors -- raise the possibility of a nuclear war. Beijing has already told the US and Japan privately that it considers any country providing bases and logistics support to any US forces attacking China as belligerent parties open to its retaliation. In the region, this means South Korea, Japan, the Philippines and, to a lesser extent, Singapore. If China were to retaliate, east Asia will be set on fire. And the conflagration may not end there as opportunistic powers elsewhere may try to overturn the existing world order. With the US distracted, Russia may seek to redefine Europe’s political landscape. The balance of power in the Middle East may be similarly upset by the likes of Iraq. In south Asia, hostilities between India and Pakistan, each armed with its own nuclear arsenal, could enter a new and dangerous phase. Will a full-scale Sino-US war lead to a nuclear war? According to General Matthew Ridgeway, commander of the US Eighth Army which fought against the Chinese in the Korean War, the US had at the time thought of using nuclear weapons against China to save the US from military defeat. In his book The Korean War, a personal account of the military and political aspects of the conflict and its implications on future US foreign policy, Gen Ridgeway said that US was confronted with two choices in Korea -- truce or a broadened war, which could have led to the use of nuclear weapons. If the US had to resort to nuclear weaponry to defeat China long before the latter acquired a similar capability, there is little hope of winning a war against China 50 years later, short of using nuclear weapons. The US estimates that China possesses about 20 nuclear warheads that can destroy major American cities. Beijing also seems prepared to go for the nuclear option. A Chinese military officer disclosed recently that Beijing was considering a review of its “non first use” principle regarding nuclear weapons. Major-General Pan Zhangqiang, president of the military-funded Institute for Strategic Studies, told a gathering at the Woodrow Wilson International Centre for Scholars in Washington that although the government still abided by that principle, there were strong pressures from the military to drop it. He said military leaders considered the use of nuclear weapons mandatory if the country risked dismemberment as a result of foreign intervention. Gen Ridgeway said that should that come to pass, we would see the destruction of civilisation. </span><br />

But to physically attack America (as happened on 9/11), or American interests abroad (as in the cases of the embassy bombings and the USS Cole), requires that America also be depicted as weak and vulnerable. It is this perception of America, in the eyes of the Arab world, that represents the greatest threat to Western civilization because Arab misperceptions about America have led to wars. Acts of terrorism are encouraged by the belief that America is essentially weak, vulnerable, and capable of being brought to its knees by a high body-bag count before it has achieved its strategic objectives. It has been this perceived “softness” that has encouraged terrorists like al Qaeda and rogue nations like Iraq, Iran and Syria to act against America and American interests abroad. In the Middle Eastern mindset, it is fatal for any nation to be perceived as weak and vulnerable. And, in many ways, our actions and reactions have led to their perceptions. The explosion of Islamic terror and the threats of mass destruction from an Iraqi tyrant armed with nuclear or biological weapons could have been prevented. For example, in the 90’s, the decade of denial, hesitation and prevarication, U.S. foreign policy consisted of Bill Clinton desperately seeking a legacy, running America by opinion polls, sending cruise missiles to blow up empty tents in the Afghan desert, signing agreements with dictators based on the belief that America would be &quot;safe,&quot; and seeing attacks and provocations as nothing more than a series of separate and unrelated criminal acts rather than as a sustain organized military assault on America. The assumption in those days, according to Claudia Rosett writing in the Wall Street Journal recently, was that “what we didn’t acknowledge, really couldn’t hurt us. As long as we got dictators to sign on the dotted line, we’d be safe......protected by the paperwork that said so.” Decisions to use force were avoided to prevent a confrontation with the Arab and Islamic world, and also in the naive hope that these threats would simply disappear. As a consequence, America focused on the arrest and trial of “the criminals,” protecting buildings rather than tracking down the terrorists and neutralizing their funders, planners, organizers and commanders. Worse, America relied on metal detectors, security guards, electronic surveillance and trials rather than ships, aircraft, soldiers and human intelligence. America studied the acts of terror as distinct from the ideology of the terrorist. It failed to recognize that the cumulative effect of these acts against America and American interests abroad were part of a sustained assault on this country. And our enemies perceived this as American vulnerability. The result was inevitable. This policy of &quot;self-deception&quot; led to the monstrous growth of al Qaeda, the naive Oil-for-Food shell-game with Iraq, the Oslo Accords, and the 1994 &quot;Agreed Framework&quot; with North Korea whereby America proclaimed “peace on the Korean peninsula” in return for allowing North Korea (a soon-to-be-member of the Axis of Evil) food, oil and the wiggle-room necessary to continue making (and marketing) missiles, chemical and biological weapons, and ultimately, its own nuclear weapon. The North Korean fiasco was not the only attempt during the Clinton era at what Charles Krauthammer refers to as &quot;paper diplomacy.&quot; The bloodiest farce was the Oslo &quot;peace&quot; Accords between Israel and the Palestinians. President Clinton insisted that it be signed on the White House lawn under his upraised arms. He then spent the next seven years brokering one new agreement after another while declaring the peace &quot;irreversible.&quot; He knew it was so because Yasser Arafat had promised - in writing - an end to violence and terrorism. Then Arafat decided to start up the violence and terrorism in September 2000, bringing on the worst Israeli-Palestinian bloodshed in decades and leaving the Clinton &quot;paper-pushers&quot; surprised. The absurd UN-run Oil-for-Food program with Iraq was another piece of paper based on the false assumption that Saddam Hussein would respect the written rules crafted by the world’s most hapless bureaucracy - the UN. Needless to say, he didn’t respect the rules, used Syria and Iran to bypass them, and now, he too is on the verge of acquiring nuclear weapons. For too long, America has deluded itself into a false sense of security based upon the written word of dictators, and this delusion has lead to the Arab perception of American weakness. Written agreements didn't work well with Hitler or Mussolini and they still don't. Unfortunately, the Oil-for-Food program, the Oslo Accords and the Korean Agreed Framework were not isolated incidents. The Arab states and al Qaeda took cognizance of the fact that the U.S., in the past, also failed to respond aggressively to many terrorist attacks against its own citizens in Beirut, in Tanzania, in Kenya and in Somalia; stood by while Americans were seized as hostages in Iran and Lebanon; let Saddam Hussein remain in power after the Gulf War (while letting the Shah fall in Iran); and pressured Israel, its ally, to make dangerous strategic concessions while simultaneously courting Israel’s enemies and allowing its prized Arab-Israeli peace process to be destroyed. This policy also led the Chinese to conclude that “the United States is a superpower in decline, losing economic, political and military influence around the world,” according to the congressionally-mandated U.S.-China Security Review Commission. The Commission also noted that “Chinese analysts believe that the United States cannot and will not sustain casualties in pursuit of its vital interests.” That is, America is &quot;soft.&quot; And China is far from alone in holding this opinion. America’s perceived decline into weakness and its questionable “staying power” in pursuit of its strategic objectives has served as a call to arms to the monsters of the world. Astute Middle Eastern observers have made much of the United States' post-Vietnam loathing for foreign adventures, and America's enemies have listened. In the 1970s, when many Iranians worried that American power would destroy their revolution if it went too far, Khomeini told them not to worry, saying America &quot;won't do a damn thing.&quot; And as recently as 1998, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Khomeini's successor, insisted there was no need to negotiate with the United States since Tehran had shown that Washington was “too weak to be feared or heeded.” </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Contention Three – Solvency</span><br />
<span class="Underline">The stalled pilot program proves that the plan will lead to an influx of highly-skilled recruits</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Rangel, 2/2/2010 (Danny, Flourishing Military Recruitment Plan Stalled, Change.org, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://news.change.org/stories/flourishing_military_recruitment_plan_stalled" rel="nofollow">http://news.change.org/stories/flourishing_military_recruitment_plan_stalled</a>)</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Given the increasingly difficult and sometimes prohibitively expensive process of gaining American citizenship, many immigrants have welcomed military service as a means of becoming citizens. Within a very short span of time after the program's creation, the Army exceeded its recruiting expectations; yielding, by its own account, particularly high-quality servicemembers. In the hopes of qualifying for the program, more than 14,000 immigrants have contacted the military and passed a first round of vetting. For the pilot program to continue, the Defense Department needed to complete a review of the (clearly successful) program. Instead, it opted to drag its heels. No doubt, the general incompetence of a government bureaucracy played a role here. Unable to see a good thing in front of them, the Defense Department instead chose a route that hurts our military, as in the case of another senseless decision regarding nine Army linguists dismissed because they were discovered to be homosexual. Let us not forget that America is in the midst of two wars, which demand the skills of those who are willing to serve. Although the current economic crisis has, for the time being, dramatically increased recruiting numbers throughout the country, the increased troop presence forecast for Afghanistan, the ever-dangerous situation in Iraq, aid efforts in Haiti, and other foreign military commitments require a steady stream of new service members. At the very least, more American troops would relieve veteran soldiers subjected to dangerously long tour duties and time away from their families. In addition to the plan's obvious strategic advantages, the moral value of allowing skilled immigrants to gain citizenship and hopefully create better lives for themselves and their families is immeasurable. Right now, there are immigrants who are ready and willing to serve their adopted country -- volunteering in a time of war no less, with a real threat of harm, when the average American citizen (in fact, an overwhelming number of Americans) is more than happy to sit on the sidelines. This is a much easier, much more worthwhile path to citizenship than any proposed by Congress, one with positives that far outweigh any negatives, and we've decided to simply sit on it. There is no doubt: the federal government enjoys working at a snail's pace. It loves to start crucially important reforms and then decide to take an absurd amount of time finishing them (health care anyone?). It has failed to promptly deliver results when they are most needed, as in the case of the bungled response to Hurricane Katrina. And it is far too common for the government to put pressing initiatives on the back burner and never return to them. But having skilled personnel in our military, now more than ever, is of critical importance. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Temporary to permanent is a citizen incentive</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Anderson, January 2011 (Stuart - adjunct scholar at the Cato Institute, U.S. Immigration Reform Should Focus on Improving the Employment-Based Visa System, Immigration Reform Bulletin, p. 1)</span><br />
<span class="Underline">The first important distinction to under-stand in our immigration system is the difference between (1) receiving temporary status (see Table 1) and (2) gaining lawful permanent residence, sometimes known as receiving one’s “green card” (see Table 2). An employee in temporary status or on a temporary visa (also known as a “nonimmi-grant” visa) can stay in the United States for a period of time but is not entitled to remain permanently or become a U.S. citizen. In contrast, a worker who receives permanent residence (a green card) can remain in the United States for the rest of his or her life (barring long absences or certain criminal convictions) and can become eligible for U.S. citizenship. 1 </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Targeting temporary visa holders provides the military with thousands of untapped quality recruits. An offer of a green card will provide a strong incentive for participation </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Preston, 2/14/2009 (Julia, U.S. Military Will Offer Path to Citizenship, New York Times, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/15/us/15immig.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/15/us/15immig.html</a>)</span><br />
<span class="Underline">The military does not allow illegal immigrants to enlist, and that policy would not change, officers said. Recruiting officials pointed out that volunteers with temporary visas would have already passed a security screening and would have shown that they had no criminal record. “The Army will gain in its strength in human capital,” General Freakley said, “and the immigrants will gain their citizenship and get on a ramp to the American dream.” In recent years, as American forces faced combat in two wars and recruiters struggled to meet their goals for the all-volunteer military, thousands of legal immigrants with temporary visas who tried to enlist were turned away because they lacked permanent green cards, recruiting officers said. Recruiters’ work became easier in the last few months as unemployment soared and more Americans sought to join the military. But the Pentagon, facing a new deployment of 30,000 troops to Afghanistan, still has difficulties in attracting doctors, specialized nurses and language experts. Several types of temporary work visas require college or advanced degrees or professional expertise, and immigrants who are working as doctors and nurses in the United States have already been certified by American medical boards. Military figures show that only 82 percent of about 80,000 Army recruits last year had high school diplomas. According to new figures, the Army provided waivers to 18 percent of active-duty recruits in the final four months of last year, allowing them to enlist despite medical conditions or criminal records. Military officials want to attract immigrants who have native knowledge of languages and cultures that the Pentagon considers strategically vital. The program will also be open to students and refugees. The Army’s one-year pilot program will begin in New York City to recruit about 550 temporary immigrants who speak one or more of 35 languages, including Arabic, Chinese, Hindi, Igbo (a tongue spoken in Nigeria), Kurdish, Nepalese, Pashto, Russian and Tamil. Spanish speakers are not eligible. The Army’s program will also include about 300 medical professionals to be recruited nationwide. Recruiting will start after Department of Homeland Security officials update an immigration rule in coming days. Pentagon officials expect that the lure of accelerated citizenship will be powerful. Under a statute invoked in 2002 by the Bush administration, immigrants who serve in the military can apply to become citizens on the first day of active service, and they can take the oath in as little as six months. For foreigners who come to work or study in the United States on temporary visas, the path to citizenship is uncertain and at best agonizingly long, often lasting more than a decade. The military also waives naturalization fees, which are at least $675. To enlist, temporary immigrants will have to prove that they have lived in the United States for two years and have not been out of the country for longer than 90 days during that time. They will have to pass an English test. Language experts will have to serve four years of active duty, and health care professionals will serve three years of active duty or six years in the Reserves. If the immigrants do not complete their service honorably, they could lose their citizenship. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Nuclear threats aren’t credible – flexible ground forces are key to deterrence.</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Michael S. Gerson, research analyst at the Center for Naval Analyses, “Conventional Deterrence in the Second Nuclear Age,” Fall 2009, Paramters, Vol. 39, Iss. 3, ProQuest</span><br />
<span class="Underline">In the current international security environment, conventional deterrence can be useful against nonnuclear and nuclear-armed adversaries. For regimes that do not possess nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons, US conventional capabilities will likely be the most credible and potent deterrent. History suggests that, in general, nations without weapons of mass destruction (WMD) are not intimidated by an opponent's nuclear capabilities. For example, nuclear weapons did not give the United States significant advantages before or during the Korean and Vietnam wars; nor did they dissuade Egypt from attacking Israel in the 1973 Yom Kippur War11 or Argentina from attacking the British-controlled Falkland Islands in 1982.12 This circumstance is due in part to the perceived impact of the &quot;nuclear taboo,&quot; a moral and political aversion to using nuclear weapons that has emerged due to the absence of nuclear use in time of war. The nuclear taboo reduces the credibility-and therefore the utility-of nuclear weapons, especially against regimes not possessing nuclear weapons or other WMD.13 Although implicit or explicit nuclear threats may lack credibility against non-WMD regimes, many potential adversaries believe that the United States will use conventional firepower, especially because America has conventional superiority and a demonstrated willingness to use it. Consequently, when dealing with non-WMD-related threats, conventional deterrence will be the most likely mechanism for deterring hostile actions. According to Admiral Michael Mullen, the current Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, &quot;A big part of credibility, of course, lies in our conventional capability. The capability to project power globally and conduct effective theater-level operations . . . remains essential to deterrence effectiveness.&quot;14 Conventional deterrence also plays an important role in preventing nonnuclear aggression by nuclear-armed regimes. Regional nuclear proliferation may not only increase the chances for the use of nuclear weapons, but, equally important, the possibility of conventional aggression. The potential for conventional conflict under the shadow of mutual nuclear deterrence was a perennial concern throughout the Cold War, and that scenario is still relevant. A perceived nuclear-armed adversary may be emboldened to use conventional force against US friends and allies, or to sponsor terrorism, in the belief that its nuclear capabilities give it an effective deterrent against US retaliation or intervention.15 For example, a regime might calculate that it could undertake conventional aggression against a neighbor and, after achieving a relatively quick victory, issue implicit or explicit nuclear threats in the expectation that the United States (and perhaps coalition partners) would choose not to become involved. In this context, conventional deterrence can be an important mechanism to limit options for regional aggression below the nuclear threshold. Given the current US advantage in conventional forces and mobility, a potential enemy is more likely to attack its neighbors if the regime believes it can accomplish its objectives before US forces can respond. In other words, a nuclear-armed regime may be more likely to undertake conventional aggression if it believes that a favorable local balance of power would provide an opportunity for a fait accompli. By deploying robust conventional forces in and around the theater of potential conflict, the United States can credibly signal that its forces will respond to any aggression early in a conflict. Therefore, the threatening regime cannot hope to achieve its military objectives while using its nuclear arsenal to cancel US intervention. If the United States can convince an opponent that US forces will engage early in the conflict-and that America is willing to accept the human and financial costs of combat- it may persuade opponents that the United States is resolved to continue the conflict even in the face of nuclear threats because American blood and treasure would already have been expended.16 Similar to the Cold War, the deployment of American conventional power in a region, combined with nuclear capability and escalation dominance, may prevent hostile regimes from thinking nuclear possession provides opportunities for aggression and coercion below the nuclear threshold.</span><br />

Contention 1: Inherency<br />
Must act immediately – the entitlement debt bomb will explode, and crush the economy<br />
Rahn ‘9 (Richard, Senior Fellow at the Cato Institute &amp; Chair of the Institute for Global Economic Growth, 9-22-9, “The Growing Debt Bomb,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=10563" rel="nofollow">http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=10563</a>)<br />
Finally, you also became aware of the following facts: Federal government expenditures are growing far faster than the economy, and thus the government is becoming a larger and larger share of gross domestic product. Obviously, this cannot continue forever because eventually the government would totally drive out the private sector. The entitlement programs (i.e., Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, etc.) all continue to grow faster than the economy, and they will take more than 100 percent of all federal tax revenue this year, requiring that virtually all of the other government spending programs, including defense and interest payments on the debt, be funded by more borrowing. You are also aware that the government cannot tax its way out of the deficit situation, because increasing income tax rates on the upper income people will both slow the economy and cause them to find legal or illegal ways to avoid the tax increase, and the politicians have pledged to not increase taxes on those making less than $250,000, which includes all but a very few Americans. Even if the politicians break their pledges not to increase taxes, they still cannot solve the deficit problem as long as they refuse to cut back on the growth in Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid — because any new tax revenue will be quickly absorbed by the growth in spending. The best that any tax increase could do is delay the explosion of the debt bomb by, perhaps, a couple of years while further weakening the economy and job growth. Now suppose you are not an individual bondholder but the Chinese government official responsible for the Chinese economy, and you know your government holds about $1 trillion in U.S. government securities. You have watched Congress and the administration become less and less fiscally responsible — more spending, more taxes, and more debt. Then suddenly the administration puts punitive tariffs on your tire manufacturers while at the same time refuses to approve the trade treaties with Colombia, Panama and South Korea that have been negotiated. You understand that these foolish and destructive actions by U.S. government officials indicate it does not understand the importance of free trade in fostering economic growth, and seem to be intent on replicating the mistakes of the 1930s. The Chinese are not stupid, and they have been vocal in saying they are concerned that U.S. policies will lead to a further fall in the dollar and higher rates of inflation, both of which undermine the value of their investment in U.S. government securities. The Chinese are now trying to diversify their holdings — and their recent activity in buying large quantities of tradable commodities is probably, in part, a hedge against a falling U.S. dollar. Thus, at the same time, the U.S. government needs to sell trillions of dollars of new bonds. It is by its own actions driving away foreign purchasers of bonds, which can only result in higher interest rates in the United States, which will further slow economic growth. What is particularly frightening is that neither political party has offered a serious plan to defuse the debt bomb. The Democrats are just piling up more debt as if there were no limit, and the Republicans, to date, are only proposing measures to reduce the increase, rather than reverse it. When the debt bomb explodes — within the next one to three years — expect to see record high real interest rates and/or inflation, coupled with a collapse of many &quot;entitlements.&quot; It will be like the neutron bomb, the buildings will be left standing, but the people will not.<br />
Contention 2: Growth<br />
Entitlement deficits crush the global economy – recovery is impossible because of a structural cycle<br />
Chamberlain ‘7 (Andrew, of the Tax Foundation, 1-18-7 ,“Growing Entitlement Spending and 'Economic Collapse',” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.taxfoundation.org/blog/show/2160.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.taxfoundation.org/blog/show/2160.html</a>)<br />
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke warned today of a &quot;fiscal crisis&quot; in coming years if the government does not act soon to curb federal retirement and health care entitlement programs, picking up a theme that his predecessor, Alan Greenspan, had pursued without success at the end of his term as head of the central bank. In prepared remarks delivered this morning to the Senate Budget Committee, Bernanke said that a dip this year in the annual federal budget deficit to $248 billion was &quot;the calm before the storm,&quot; with ballooning entitlement payments looming over the next 20 years as the Baby Boomers retire and medical costs skyrocket. By 2030, he said, spending under current law on Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid could consume as much as 15 percent of the nation's economic output, double the current rate. Underwriting that could lead to a &quot;vicious cycle,&quot; he said, as the nation borrows more to meet its obligations and spends increasing amounts to service that debt, leaving less for investors and consumers and slowing economic growth. &quot;If early and meaningful action is not taken, the U.S. economy could be seriously weakened with future generations bearing much of the cost&quot;... (Full piece here.) While dire warnings like these may seem alarmist, few people realize how conventional these frightening scenarios of the long-term budget picture have become in Washington policy circles. A famous example comes from the otherwise-staid Congressional Budget Office, who uses colorful language such as economic &quot;collapse&quot; to describe the possible impact of growing entitlement spending on the U.S. economy: Taken to the extreme, such a path [of borrowing to cover growing entitlement spending] could result in an economic crisis. Foreign investors could reduce their purchases of U.S. securities, the exchange value of the dollar could plunge, interest rates could climb, consumer prices could shoot up, or the economy could contract sharply. Amid the anticipation of declining profits and rising inflation and interest rates, stock markets could collapse and consumers might sharply reduce their consumption. Moreover, economic problems in the United States could spill over to the rest of the world and seriously weaken the economies of U.S. trading partners.<br />
Must act now to restore our international credit rating – perception of not acting will crash the global economy<br />
Washington Post ‘11 (January 27, “U.S. needs to make progress on deficit, IMF warns”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-" rel="nofollow">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-</a>dyn/content/article/2011/01/27/AR2011012707000.html)<br />
U.S. officials must act quickly to control government deficits or face slower growth and even more difficult choices in the future, the International Monetary Fund said Thursday in a report criticizing the tepid U.S. response to its rising public debt. The IMF warning comes as federal officials grapple with a congressional projection this week that the annual deficit will reach a historic $1.5 trillion this year. This was the latest report to raise concerns about how massive government debts in developed countries could undermine the global economic recovery. &quot;The U.S. has a lot of credibility. This does not imply their credibility can last forever,&quot; IMF fiscal affairs director Carlo Cottarelli said as he released the IMF study. It concluded that the United States is falling behind on a promise it made to other top economic countries to halve its budget deficit by 2013. &quot;This is a problem many years in the making and will take a concerted effort by Democrats and Republicans working together to find a solution,&quot; White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said in answer to a question about the IMF report. He noted that President Obama called for a freeze on discretionary spending during this week's State of the Union address. IMF officials have welcomed the step but said that spending cuts in pension and health entitlement programs are also needed. The United States wasn't the only economic power criticized by the IMF. Japan has also slipped in its deficit goals, the IMF said. Underscoring the point, Standard &amp; Poor's on Thursday lowered Japan's bond rating to AA- from AA on concern that the country's politicians won't come to terms with debts that are roughly twice the size of the national economy. Although Japan still has a relatively high rating, the downgrade was a reminder that even a historically strong and creditworthy economy - with a widely used &quot;safe- haven&quot; currency - can come under the type of pressure that in recent months left Greece and Ireland strapped with rising debt costs and needing international bailouts. The U.S. situation is far less dire. The roughly $14 trillion U.S. economy is by far the world's largest, the dollar remains the favored reserve currency, and U.S. capital markets are large enough to absorb investments from around the world. But IMF officials said the country's public debt is so outsize - and continuing to grow - that U.S. officials need to &quot;strengthen their credibility.&quot; However unlikely, a downgrade in U.S. debt or loss of confidence in the government's ability to repay its creditors could touch off a catastrophic series of events - from a shutdown of global trade finance and credit to the collapse of banks and governments that hold large amounts of U.S. debt and depend on the flow of money through and from the United States to stay afloat. Not long ago, the United States appeared to be on track to meet the commitment to halve its annual deficit by 2013. At a gathering of the world's top economic leaders in Canada last summer, U.S. officials promised to reduce the deficit to roughly 6 percent of gross domestic product. But new, less-optimistic forecasts put the country in danger of missing that goal. According to data released this week by the Congressional Budget Office, recent tax cuts and expected spending will keep the annual deficit this year at about 10 percent of GDP. That is similar to deficits in European countries, such as Spain and Britain, that have come under pressure from international bond markets to curb their spending, raise taxes and restructure their economies. The total amount of outstanding U.S. debt, meanwhile, is expected to equal about 70 percent of the nation's economy by next year. If combined with the amounts owed by states, public debt will top 100 percent of GDP. European countries have begun a pointed dialogue with their residents about what government can and cannot afford. Moves to cut public salaries, trim services and curb public pensions have touched off strikes and protests - but also put the deficits of those countries on what seems to be a securely downward path, the IMF said. Those are choices the United States has been hesitant to make, particularly when economists still widely consider government spending to be important in supporting the economic recovery. The debate over deficits, moreover, has tended to steer away from politically sensitive topics such as cutting or restructuring Social Security and Medicare - areas in which the IMF says costs will almost certainly need to be trimmed if the United States is to make progress curbing its debt. In an analysis of U.S. debt last week, S&amp;P analysts said the unthinkable could occur unless U.S. officials take action. &quot;The 'AAA' rating on the U.S. government assumes that the government will soon reveal a credible plan to tighten fiscal policy to enable the general government debt-to-GDP ratio to stabilize and then to decline in the medium term,&quot; agency analysts wrote. &quot;Absent a credible plan, the rating on the U.S. federal government will come under pressure.&quot;<br />
Nuclear war<br />
Mead ‘9 (Walter Russell, Senior Fellow in U.S. Foreign Policy at the Council on Foreign Relations, New Republic, February 4, 2009)<br />
So far, such half-hearted experiments not only have failed to work; they have left the societies that have tried them in a progressively worse position, farther behind the front-runners as time goes by. Argentina has lost ground to Chile; Russian development has fallen farther behind that of the Baltic states and Central Europe. Frequently, the crisis has weakened the power of the merchants, industrialists, financiers, and professionals who want to develop a liberal capitalist society integrated into the world. Crisis can also strengthen the hand of religious extremists, populist radicals, or authoritarian traditionalists who are determined to resist liberal capitalist society for a variety of reasons. Meanwhile, the companies and banks based in these societies are often less established and more vulnerable to the consequences of a financial crisis than more established firms in wealthier societies. As a result, developing countries and countries where capitalism has relatively recent and shallow roots tend to suffer greater economic and political damage when crisis strikes--as, inevitably, it does. And, consequently, financial crises often reinforce rather than challenge the global distribution of power and wealth. This may be happening yet again. None of which means that we can just sit back and enjoy the recession. History may suggest that financial crises actually help capitalist great powers maintain their leads--but it has other, less reassuring messages as well. If financial crises have been a normal part of life during the 300-year rise of the liberal capitalist system under the Anglophone powers, so has war. The wars of the League of Augsburg and the Spanish Succession; the Seven Years War; the American Revolution; the Napoleonic Wars; the two World Wars; the cold war: The list of wars is almost as long as the list of financial crises. Bad economic times can breed wars. Europe was a pretty peaceful place in 1928, but the Depression poisoned German public opinion and helped bring Adolf Hitler to power. If the current crisis turns into a depression, what rough beasts might start slouching toward Moscow, Karachi, Beijing, or New Delhi to be born? The United States may not, yet, decline, but, if we can't get the world economy back on track, we may still have to fight.<br />
Try or die – Must continue accelerated growth and wishful thinking to solve industrial civilization’s problems<br />
Atkisson ‘1 – SUSTAINABILITY CONSULTANT SUSTAINABILITY IS DEAD-LONG LIVE SUSTAINABILITY, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.rrcap.unep.org/uneptg06/course/Robert/SustainabilityManifesto2001.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.rrcap.unep.org/uneptg06/course/Robert/SustainabilityManifesto2001.pdf</a><br />
AT THE DAWN of the Third Millennium, human civilization finds itself in a seeming paradox of gargantuan proportions. On the one hand, industrial and technological growth is destroying much of Nature, endangering ourselves, and threatening our descendants. On the other hand, we must accelerate our industrial and technological development, or the forces we have already unleashed will wreak even greater havoc on the world for generations to come. We cannot go on, and we cannot stop. We must transform. Facing a Great Paradox At precisely the moment when humanity’s science, technology, and economy has grown to the point that we can monitor and evaluate all the major systems that support life, all over the Earth, we have discovered that most of these systems are being systematically degraded and destroyed . . . by our science, technology, and economy. The evidence that we are beyond the limits to growth is by now overwhelming: the alarms include climatic change, disappearing biodiversity, falling human sperm counts, troubling slow-downs in food production after decades of rapid expansion, the beginning of serious international tensions over basic needs like water. Wild storms and floods and eerie changes in weather patterns are but a first visible harbinger of more serious trouble to come, trouble for which we are not adequately prepared. Indeed, change of all kinds—in the Biosphere (nature as a whole), the Technosphere (the entirety of human manipulation of nature), and the Noösphere (the collective field of human consciousness)—is happening so rapidly that it exceeds our capacity to understand it, control it, or respond to it adequately in corrective ways. Humanity is simultaneously entranced by its own power, overwhelmed by the problems created by progress, and continuing to steer itself over a cliff. Our economies and technologies are changing certain basic structures of planetary life, such as the balance of carbon in the atmosphere, genetic codes, the amount of forest cover, species variety and distribution, and the foundations of cultural identity. Unless we make technological advances of the highest order, many of the destructive changes we are causing to nature are irreversible. Extinct species cannot (yet) be brought back to life. No credible strategy for controlling or reducing carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere has been put forward. We do not know how to fix what we’re breaking. At the same time, some of the very products of our technology— plutonium, for instance—require of us that we maintain a very high degree of cultural continuity, economic and political stability, and technological capacity and sophistication, far into the future. To ensure our safety and the safety of all forms of life, we must always be able to store, clean up, and contain poisons like plutonium and persistent organic toxins. Eventually we must be able to eliminate them safely. At all times, we must be able to contain the actions of evil or unethical elements in our societies who do not care about the consequences to life of unleashing our most dangerous creations. In the case of certain creations, like nuclear materials and some artificially constructed or genetically modified organisms, our secure custodianship must be maintained for thousands of years. We are, in effect, committed to a high-technology future. Any slip in our mastery over the forces now under our command could doom our descendants—including not just human descendants, but also those wild species still remaining in the oceans and wilderness areas—to unspeakable suffering. We must continue down an intensely scientific and technological path, and we can never stop. Sustaining such high levels of complex civilization and continuous development has never before happened in the history of humanity, so far as we know. From the evidence in hand, ancient civilizations have generally done no better than a few hundred years of highly variable progress and regress, at comparatively low levels of technology, with relatively minor risks to the greater whole associated with their inevitable collapse. The only institutions that have demonstrated continuity over millennia are religions and spiritual traditions and institutions. So, while we must be intensely scientific, our future is also in need of a renewed sense of spirituality and the sacred. Given our diversity and historic circumstances, no one religion is likely to be able, now or in the future, to sustain us or unite us.We need a new sense of spirituality that is inclusive of believers, nonbelievers, and those for whom belief itself is not the core of spiritual experience.We need a sense of the sacred that is inclusive of the scientific quest and the technological imperative. We need a common sense of high purpose that connects, bridges, and uplifts all of our religious traditions to their highest levels of wisdom and compassion, while sustaining and honoring their unique historical gifts. We need, especially, all the inspiration and solace they can offer, because the task ahead of us is enormous beyond compare. Our generation is charged with an unprecedented responsibility: to lay secure foundations for a global civilization that can last for thousands 4 | Sustainability is Dead—Long Live Sustainability of years. To accomplish this task, we must, in the coming decades, maintain and greatly enhance our technical capacities and cultural stability, while simultaneously changing almost every technological system on which we now depend so that it causes no harm to people or the natural world, now or in the future. Our situation is not only without precedent; it is virtually impossible to comprehend. Those who, in the waning decades of the Second Millennium, have been able to comprehend this Great Paradox to some degree often feel themselves emotionally overwhelmed and powerless to effect change—the situation I have elsewhere called “Cassandra’s Dilemma,” after the mythical Trojan prophet whose accurate foresight went unheeded. Those in power, on the other hand, face stiff barriers to comprehension and action, including financial, political, and psychological disincentives. Denial and avoidance have been civilization’s predominant responses to the warnings coming from science and the signals coming from nature during the 1970s, 80s, and 90s. But the feedback from nature, as well as the growing global distress signals from those left behind in either relative or absolute poverty, are both becoming so strong that they can no longer be denied, even by those with the greatest vested interest in denial. These early decades of the Third Millennium—and especially this first decade, which philosopher Michael Zimmerman has said should be declared “the Oughts” to signify the urgency for addressing what ought to be done—are the decades of reckoning, the time for decisively changing course. Modest Changes are Not Enough Change is clearly possible. Modest changes in the direction of greater sustainability are now underway, and modest, incremental changes in both technology and habitual practice can ameliorate—indeed, have ameliorated—some dangerous trends in the short run. But overall, incremental change of this sort has proven exceedingly slow and difficult to effect, and most incremental change efforts fall far short of what is needed. Carbon emissions, which are now causing visible climate change, provide a good example: current global agreements for modest reductions are hard to reach, impossible to enforce, and virtually without effect; and even if they were successful, they would have a negligible impact on the critical trend. Far more dramatic changes are required. Dramatic, rapid change, in the form of extremely accelerated innovation in the Noösphere (conscious awareness and understanding) and A Manifesto | 5 the Technosphere (physical practice) is necessary both to prevent continuing and ever more catastrophic damage to the Biosphere, and to adapt to those irreversible changes to which the planet is already committed, such as some amount of climatic instability. The rapid evolution of many social, economic, and political institutions, which mediate between the Noösphere and the Technosphere, is obviously necessary as well. Without extraordinary and dramatic change, the most probable outcome of industrial civilization's current trajectory is convulsion and collapse. “Collapse” refers not to a sudden or apocalyptic ending, but to a process of accelerating social, economic, and ecological decay over the course of a generation or two, punctuated by ever-worsening episodes of crisis. The results would likely be devastating, in both human and ecological terms. The onset of collapse is probably not ahead of us in time, but behind us: in some places, such as storm-ravaged Orissa, Honduras, Bangladesh, Venezuela, even England and France, collapse-related entropy may already be apparent. Trend, of course, is probability, not destiny. It is still theoretically possible, albeit very unlikely, that civilization could continue straight ahead, without any conscious effort to direct technological development and the actions of markets in more environmentally benign and culturally constructive ways, and escape collapse through an unexpected (though currently unimaginable) technological breakthrough or improbable set of events. Some have called this the “Miracle Scenario.” But hoping for a miracle is by far the riskiest choice. The future may be fundamentally unknowable, but certain physical processes are predictable, given adequate knowledge about current trends, causal linkages, and systemic effects. Prediction based on extrapolation is not just the province of physics: much of our economy is focused on efforts to accurately predict the future based on past trends. The Internet economy, for example, relies upon Moore’s Law (that the speed and capacity of semiconductor chips doubles roughly every 18 months). Insurance companies base their entire portfolio of investments and fees on statistical assessments of past disasters and projected trends into the future. When it comes to the prospects for sustaining our civilization, we have to trust our species’ best judgment, which comes from the interpretations and extrapolations of our best experts. These experts—such as the respected Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change—are reporting a disturbingly high degree of consensus about the level of threat to our future well-being. We are in trouble. We must transform our civilization. 6 | Sustainability is Dead—Long Live Sustainability Transformation is Possible Dramatic civilizational change—transformation, in a word—is not so difficult to imagine. History is full of examples. Global history since the Renaissance, with all our remarkable transformations in technology, economics, and culture, is largely a product of humanity learning to take seriously the evidence of its senses, to reflect on that evidence carefully, and to make provisional conclusions that can be tested. This is the cornerstone of science. If we are to take seriously the evidence of our senses and our science, we must provisionally conclude that we are now largely responsible for living conditions on this planet. We have the power to fundamentally shape climate, manage ecosystems, design life-forms, and much more. The fact that we are currently doing these things very badly obscures the fact that we are doing them, and can therefore learn to do them better. Designing and managing the world is now our responsibility. That is the hypothesis that must now be tested by humanity as a whole, if we are to prevent collapse and succeed in restoration. To succeed, we must take our responsibility as world-shapers far more seriously than we currently do. History demonstrates that we, as a species, have the power to create the future we envision. If, therefore, we give in to despair, collapse will follow. If we cultivate a vision of ourselves as powerful and wise stewards of our planetary home, transformation becomes possible. Examples of cultural transformation occurring in a generation or less abound. The Meiji Restoration transformed Japan from a closed, agricultural society to an industrial one in just a few decades. The wholesale redirection of the North American and European economies during World War II took just a few years. The Apollo Program’s success in putting humans on the moon transpired, on schedule, within a decade. The fall of the Berlin Wall . . . the end of Apartheid . . . the change in China from a state-planned to a market economy . . . much of recent history suggests that transformation is not only possible, but a frequent occurrence in civilizational evolution. None of these events, however, remotely approaches the scale of global transformation we must now effect in technology, energy, transportation, agriculture, infrastructure, and economics, based on a new cultural understanding of our role as nature’s managers, the world's architects, the planet’s artists and engineers. But this testimony from history illustrates something profoundly important about transformation, in addition to its raw and indisputable possibility: no transformative A Manifesto | 7 change truly happens suddenly. Nor does transformation involve the magical or instantaneous creation of a new culture. “Transformation” is the name we give to the extremely accelerated adoption of existing innovations, together with the acceleration of innovation itself. Understanding transformation in these terms gives, to those who seek to create one, a reason for hope. An enormous amount of design work, preliminary to a transformation of the kind envisioned here, has already been done. Inventions, policies, models, scenarios, alternatives . . . innovations of all kinds have been developed by thoughtful and committed people over a generation, and the speed of innovation is increasing. Intense and focused commitment by a critical mass of talented, dedicated, and influential people—in business, government, religion, the arts, the civil sector, every walk of life—could accelerate the process by which innovation enters the mainstream of technical and social practice, and thereby turns humanity on a more hopeful course. By framing ambitious and visionary goals, and by highlighting the dangers and risks of inaction, this corps of skilled and forward-looking individuals in groups, organizations, corporations and governments could inspire others. The numbers involved could grow exponentially, and as institutions became thoroughly oriented toward achieving transformation, enormous resources could be mobilized, accelerating the transformation process still further. One generation of intensely focused investment, research, and redevelopment— redesigning our energy systems, overhauling our chemical industries, rebuilding our cities, finding substitutes for wood and replanting lost forests, and so much more—could transform the world as we know it into something far more beautiful, satisfying, and sustainable. This I believe: Sustainability is possible. Sustainability is desirable. Sustainability is a goal worthy of one’s life’s work. Sustainability is the great task of the next century. Sustainability is the next challenge on the road to our destiny. Sustainability is Dead—Long Live Sustainability The concept of “sustainability” sprouted and spread like grass during the last few decades of the 20th Century. In scientific terms, it means a system state that can endure indefinitely. Consider a forest: by not losing trees any faster than they grow back, the forest “system” survives despite (and sometimes because of) fires and other natural disturbances. The forest is sustainable. In more popular terms, “sustainability” has come to mean long-term survival and well-being in general, both for human civi- 8 | Sustainability is Dead—Long Live Sustainability lization and the rest of nature. As a guide to the future, the word “sustainability” is currently both our best hope and our biggest obstacle. Many have found the concept a great inspiration, and it has given rise to hundreds of initiatives around the world. But as a word, “sustainability” bores some people and frustrates others. Many have questioned the clarity of “sustainability,” and others have doubted its utility in practice. Indeed, the word is beset by problems; but the problems run deeper than most criticism would suggest. As the new Millennium begins, sustainability, as a word, is dying. It is not, as some would claim, that there is too much vagueness in its definition. A process can either continue (sustainable), or it cannot (unsustainable). A society’s use of resources, its social patterns, and its pollution emissions are such that they will either go on indefinitely (sustainability), or they will not (collapse). Societies have collapsed before, and they will do so again. History is a databank of case studies in unsustainability. Volumes have been written on the natural laws governing sustainability, and on the physical, economic, and social conditions for making sustainability real. Indicators of progress toward sustainability have been derived for cities, companies, and nations.What is sustainable, and what is not, is relatively well understood. But it must be repeated: the word “sustainability” is dying. “Sustainability” is dying because few concerted attempts have been made to enshrine a deeper understanding of the word in intellectual and political discourse, to defend the word from misappropriation, or to bring the word to public attention in a positive and exciting light. “Sustainability” is dying of misuse, and dryness, and reduction to buzzword. It is dying because it is attached to too many initiatives that are failing to achieve their stated goals—or even, in many cases, to make any significant progress in that direction. It is dying because other initiatives, more cynically, pretend to be “sustainable” when they are demonstrably not. The misuses and abuses come from all sides. Sustainability is not a substitute word for environmentalism, though it is used as such by proponents and opponents alike. Sustainability is not a substitute word for economic growth, though it gets stretched in that direction far too often (as in “sustainable growth”). Sustainable development—a term so misapplied as to be nearly beyond rescue—is not development-as-usual with a few green-looking additions or nods to social equity; but that is what it has often been reduced to in practice. Sustainability is a far more ennobling concept than most current A Manifesto | 9 application reflects. Sustainability is a dream. Sustainability is an overarching ideal toward which any human society collectively strives. Sustainability is not “the goal of all our striving,” but it is the fundamental and primordial benchmark of our maturation as a species. It is not an elegant word. It is, as words go, awkward, long, and technical in sound. But it is the best word we have for what we need: A vision. A direction. A set of criteria by which to measure our success. Let us collectively abandon our use of the words sustainability and sustainable development, as they were used in the 20th Century. “Sustainable development,” in particular, has been abused almost beyond repair. Development—the change we make to the world—can either be good or bad. Good development contributes to sustainability; bad development makes sustainability more and more impossible, and collapse more and more certain. And most current development, including much of what is being done in the name of “sustainable development,” is quite bad, causing long-term damages far greater in scope than the benefits it purports to bring. Let us therefore declare sustainability dead—and immediately proceed to revive it. To be brought back to life, sustainability, as a word, must be reinvented. It must be imbued with all the qualities that our societies need to embrace to make sustainability itself possible. The word “sustainability” should shine with promise and vibrate with creativity. Sustainability should fascinate the hungry mind, satisfy the heart in search of a meaningful life, draw people to it the way athletes are drawn to compete, the way artists are drawn to create, the way lovers are drawn to each other. For our descendants, sustainability may someday be about maintaining a hard-won balance between the needs of people, nature’s other species, and future generations of both. But we are far from balance today. For this generation, sustainability is about global transformation. Nothing could be more exciting to consider as the project of a generation, except perhaps making the first journey to the stars. We have before us the opportunity and the responsibility to begin remaking our world. We can, and we must, make it more beautiful in every respect, more delightful, more effective and efficient at securing our needs and encouraging our aspirations. In the 21st Century, let us abandon diminished applications of this potentially enlightening word, and use “sustainability” only when it carries the full radiance of a dream—the dream of civilization’s transformation to a more uplifting, beautiful, ecological, equitable, and genuinely prosperous pattern of development. 10 | Sustainability is Dead—Long Live Sustainability The Transformation of Globalization Transformation of many kinds is already happening all around us, mostly in the name of globalization. “Globalization” has become the signifier for a family of transformations in communications, finance, trade, travel, ecological and cultural interaction that are drawing the world’s people and natural systems into ever closer relationship with each other, regardless of national boundaries. Many of these transformations contribute more to the likelihood of global collapse than to global sustainability, because they are fueled by destructive technologies, they result in ever greater levels of environmental damage, they undermine national democracies, and they have so far widened dramatically the gap between rich and poor. Yet there is nothing inherently unsustainable about globalization per se, if we understand that word to mean the growing integration of global human society. Indeed, globalization of many kinds—from the spread of better technologies to the universal adoption of human rights—is essential to attaining global sustainability. But the engines of globalization need to be harnessed to a more noble set of goals and aspirations. At the heart of most descriptions of globalization is the market economy. It has often been fashionable to blame the market for the environmental crisis, and in particular to blame the market’s tendency to concentrate power within the large, independent capital structures we call “corporations.” But we need corporations, and the market, to accomplish the change we seek. To develop and spread innovations for sustainability at transformation speed, we need corporate-scale concentrations of research, production, and distribution capacity. We need the market's speed, freedom, and incentive structures. Clearly, we also need governors on the spread of destructive development, and the enormous fleet of old and dangerous innovations—from the internal combustion engine to the idea that cynical nihilism is “cool”—that are increasing our distance from the dream of sustainability at an accelerating rate. But if we can alter globalization so that it turns the enormous power of the market and the corporation in a truly sustainable direction, we will watch in awe as our world changes for the better with unimaginable speed. Envisioning the transformation of globalization will strike many as the ultimate in wishful thinking. Yet transformation begins precisely in wish and thought; and there are currently two powerful wishes adding considerable weight to global efforts to bring down the Berlin Wall between today's damaging “capitalism-at-all-costs” and tomorrow’s practice of a more mindful “capitalism conscious of all costs.” One “wish” is the United Nations’ new “Global Compact” with the corporate sector. It calls on corporations to adopt greater levels of social and environmental responsibility—a call that many are pledging to heed. The other “wish” is the non-governmental Global Reporting Initiative, which sets new criteria for measuring sustainable corporate performance and is fast becoming adopted as the international standard, by corporations and activists alike. These promising developments, still in their relative infancy, did not appear suddenly out of nowhere. There are but the latest and most successful demonstration of the power of “wishful thinking,” indulged in by hundreds of thousands of people, from the Seattle protesters of 1999 to the world government theorists of the 1930s. And these agreements are, themselves, “wishful thinking” of a kind, comprised as they are of agreements on principle and criteria for measurements. But if this is what wishful thinking can do, consider what inspired action, multiplied throughout the global system, will accomplish when seriously embraced at the same scale. Indeed, the transformation of globalization will, in many ways, signal the onset of transformation in general. When we witness the redirection of investment flows, the adoption of new rules and ethics governing the production process, the true raising of global standards of environmental, social, and economic performance, sustainability will then be written directly into the cultural genes, also known as “memes,” steering global development. These new “sustainability memes” will then be replicated in every walk of industrial life. The dream of sustainability will become business as usual.<br />
Contention 3: Econ leadership<br />
The deficit devastates the American economic model<br />
WSJ ‘10 (“Deficit Balloons Into National-Security Threat,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB100" rel="nofollow">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB100</a> 01424052748703422904575039173633482894.html)<br />
The federal budget deficit has long since graduated from nuisance to headache to pressing national concern. Now, however, it has become so large and persistent that it is time to start thinking of it as something else entirely: a national-security threat. The budget plan released Monday by the Obama administration illustrates why this escalation is warranted. The numbers are mind-numbing: a $1.6 trillion deficit this year, $1.3 trillion next year, $8.5 trillion for the next 10 years combined—and that assumes Congress enacts President Barack Obama's proposals to start bringing it down, and that the proposals work. These numbers are often discussed as an economic and domestic problem. But it's time to start thinking of the ramifications for America's ability to continue playing its traditional global role. The U.S. government this year will borrow one of every three dollars it spends, with many of those funds coming from foreign countries. That weakens America's standing and its freedom to act; strengthens China and other world powers including cash-rich oil producers; puts long-term defense spending at risk; undermines the power of the American system as a model for developing countries; and reduces the aura of power that has been a great intangible asset for presidents for more than a century. &quot;We've reached a point now where there's an intimate link between our solvency and our national security,&quot; says Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations and a senior national-security adviser in both the first and second Bush presidencies. &quot;What's so discouraging is that our domestic politics don't seem to be up to the challenge. And the whole world is watching.&quot; In the 21st-century world order, the classic, narrow definition of national-security threats already has expanded in ways that make traditional foreign-policy thinking antiquated. The list of American security concerns now includes dependence on foreign oil and global warming, for example. Consider just four of the ways that budget deficits also threaten American's national security: • They make America vulnerable to foreign pressures. The U.S. has about $7.5 trillion in accumulated debt held by the public, about half of that in the hands of investors abroad. Aside from the fact that each American next year will chip in more than $800 just to pay interest on this debt, that situation means America's government is dependent on the largesse of foreign creditors and subject to the whims of international financial markets. A foreign government, through the actions of its central bank, could put pressure on the U.S. in a way its military never could. Even under a more benign scenario, a debt-ridden U.S. is vulnerable to a run on the American dollar that begins abroad. Either way, Mr. Haass says, &quot;it reduces our independence.&quot; • Chinese power is growing as a result. A lot of the deficit is being financed by China, which is selling the U.S. many billions of dollars of manufactured goods, then lending the accumulated dollars back to the U.S. The IOUs are stacking up in Beijing. So far this has been a mutually beneficial arrangement, but it is slowly increasing Chinese leverage over American consumers and the American government. At some point, the U.S. may have to bend its policies before either an implicit or explicit Chinese threat to stop the merry-go-round. Just this weekend, for example, the U.S. angered China by agreeing to sell Taiwan $6.4 billion in arms. At some point, will the U.S. face economic servitude to China that would make such a policy decision impossible? • Long-term national-security budgets are put at risk. This year, thanks in some measure to continuing high costs from wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the U.S. will spend a once-unthinkable $688 billion on defense. (Before the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, by contrast, the figure was closer to $300 billion.) Staggering as the defense outlays are, the deficit is twice as large. The much smaller budgets for the rest of America's international operations—diplomacy, assistance for friendly nations—are dwarfed even more dramatically by the deficit. These national-security budgets have been largely sacrosanct in the era of terrorism. But unless the deficit arc changes, at some point they will come under pressure for cuts. • The American model is being undermined before the rest of the world. This is the great intangible impact of yawning budget deficits. The image of an invincible America had two large effects over the last century or so. First, it made other countries listen when Washington talked. And second, it often—not always, of course, but often—made other peoples and leaders yearn to be like America. Sometimes that produced jealousy and resentment among leaders, but often it drew to the top of foreign lands leaders who admired the U.S. and wanted their countries to emulate it. Such leaders are good allies.<br />
US economic leadership solves global nuclear war and economic cooperation with the US<br />
Mead 4 (Walter Russell, Henry A. Kissinger Senior Fellow in U.S. Foreign Policy at the Council on Foreign Relations, “America's sticky power,” Foreign Policy, March 2004)<br />
U.S. military force and cultural appeal have kept the United States at the top of the global order. But the hegemon cannot live on gunsand Hollywood alone. U.S. economic policies and institutions act as &quot;sticky power,&quot; attracting other countries to the U.S. system and then trapping them in it. Sticky power can help stabilize Iraq, bring rule of law to Russia, and prevent armed conflict between the United States and China. Since its earliest years, the United States has behaved as a global power. Not always capable of dispatching great fleets and mighty armies to every corner of the planet, the United States has nonethelessinvariably kept one eye on the evolution of the global system, and the U.S. military has long served internationally. The United States has not always boasted the world's largest or most influential economy, but the country has always regarded trade in global terms, generally nudging the world toward economic integration. U.S. ideological impulses have also been global. The poet Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote of the first shot fired in the American Revolution as &quot;the shot heard 'round the world,&quot; and Americans have always thought that their religious and political values should prevail around the globe. Historically, security threats and trade interests compelled Americans to think globally. The British sailed across the Atlantic to burn Washington, D.C.; the Japanese flew from carriers in the Pacific to bomb Pearl Harbor. Trade with Asia and Europe, as well as within the Western Hemisphere, has always been vital to U.S. prosperity. U.S. President Thomas Jefferson sent the Navy to the Mediterranean to fight against the Barbary pirates to safeguard U.S. trade in 1801. Commodore Matthew Perry opened up Japan in the 1850s partly to assure decent treatment for survivors of sunken U.S. whaling ships that washed up on Japanese shores. And the last shots in the U.S. Civil War were fired from a Confederate commerce raider attacking Union shipping in the remote waters of the Arctic Ocean. The rise of the United States to superpower status followed from this global outlook. In the 20th century, as the British system of empire and commerce weakened and fell, U.S. foreign-policymakers faced three possible choices: prop up the British Empire, ignore the problem and let the rest of the world go about its business, or replace Britain and take on the dirty job of enforcing a world order. Between the onset of World War I and the beginning of the Cold War, the United States tried all three, ultimately taking Britain's place as the gyroscope of world order. However, the Americans were replacing the British at a moment whenthe rules of the game were changing forever. The United States could not become just another empire of great power playing the old games of dominance with rivals and allies. Such competition led to war, and war between great powers was no longer an acceptable part of the international system. No, the United States was going to have to attempt something that no other nation had ever accomplished, something that many theorists of international relations would swear was impossible. The United States needed to build a system that could end thousands of years of great power conflicts, constructing a framework of power that would bring enduring peace to the whole world--repeating globally what ancient Egypt, China, and Rome had each accomplished on a regional basis. To complicate the task a bit more, the new hegemon would not be able to use some of the methods available to the Romans and others. Reducing the world's countries and civilizations to tributary provinces was beyond any military power the United States could or would bring to bear. The United States would have to develop a new way for sovereign states to coexist in a world of weapons of mass destruction and of prickly rivalries among religions, races, cultures, and states. In his 2002 book, The Paradox of American Power: Why the World's Only Superpower Can't Go It Alone, Harvard University political scientist Joseph S. Nye Jr. discusses the varieties of power that the United States can deploy as it builds its world order. Nye focuses on two types of power: hard and soft. In his analysis, hard power is military or economic force that coerces others to follow a particular courseof action. By contrast, soft power--cultural power, the power of example, the power of ideas and ideals--works more subtly; it makes others want what you want. Soft power upholds the U.S. world order because it influences others to like the U.S. system and support it of their own free will [see sidebar on page 51]. Nye's insights on soft power have attracted significant attention and will continue to have an important role in U.S. policy debates. But the distinction Nye suggests between two types of hard power--military and economic power--has received less consideration than it deserves. Traditional military power can usefully be called sharp power; those resisting it will feel bayonets pushing and prodding them in the direction they must go. This power is the foundation of the U.S. system. Economic power can be thought of as sticky power, which comprises a set of economic institutions and policies that attracts others toward U.S. influence and then traps them in it. Together with soft power (the values, ideas, habits, and politics inherent in the system), sharp and sticky power sustain U.S. hegemony and make something as artificial and historically arbitrary as the U.S.-led global system appear desirable, inevitable, and permanent.<br />
Multilateral economic cooperation solves key global threats – especially warming and prolif<br />
Matthews, 07 [Jessica, president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, &quot;Europe and the US: Confronting Global Challenges,&quot; 11/8, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.carnegieendowment.org/files/transcript_mandelson.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.carnegieendowment.org/files/transcript_mandelson.pdf</a>]<br />
Now, the question I want to answer today is, how do we do this and to what purpose? Firstly, fundamentally, we must engage with economic globalization, accept it, shape it. We’re not going to roll it back, and if we could, we shouldn’t seek to do so. In fact, I’d argue that the preservation of an equitable economic globalization should be the core political commitment at the heart of the transatlantic economic relationship, equivalent in its way to the mutual commitment to democracy that the Atlantic Charter embodied six decades ago, because managed right, an economically integrated world is ultimately not only a more stable and a more equitable world; it is also our principal means of meeting the increasing number of global challenges that require collective action. The reshaping of the global economy and the huge dramatic changes that are taking place in the economic landscape of the world certainly test the nerves of us in Europe and the nerves of you too in the United States. But just because it tests our nerves doesn’t mean to say that these changes are not in our interests. It’s true that some parts of our manufacturing sectors are certainly facing some tough competitive pressure. It is true that this will force us to think about how we choose to educate and to train ourselves in the future, and how we ensure that the benefits of economic growth are equitably shared. That’s a major policy challenge for us on both sides of the Atlantic. It is true that because of these great changes and the huge anxiety that they are generating amongst people on both sides of the Atlantic that policymakers are under increasing pressure to show that our embrace of economic globalization is not naivety, that we’re not being taken for a ride, in other words, by the rest of the world; to show that – as we need to do as policymakers – to show that closing the gate to the outside world is not a better alternative to keeping that gate open to the rest of the world. Now, these debates are broadly the same in Europe and the United States. But in an open global market, we have to understand that the growing economies of the developing world are also a competitive stimulus and a real engine for the growth of our own economies. They are a market for our goods and for our investment. They are a source of downward pressure on consumer prices and inflation at home. They are also the driving force that has lifted perhaps half a billion people out of poverty in half a human lifetime, which is hard to argue against. In defending and preserving this openness to the world and this growth of the global economy and its integration, the EU and the U.S. are faced with some simple realities. The first is that we now live in a world that is increasingly economically multi-polar. One billion new workers have entered the global labor force in the space of just two decades in the world. In those 20-odd years, China has risen from a country with which the EU traded almost literally nothing to becoming our biggest trading partner for manufacturers. In some ways, an older balance of economic power is reasserting itself in the world. In 1830, India and China were the two biggest economies in the world – in 1830. By 2050, they will again be amongst the very largest economies in the world. Of course, this is not the only way of weighing power in the modern world, far from it. But it is fundamental. And that’s in the nature of the fundamental revolution in economic terms, and also political terms, therefore, that the world is undergoing. Now, the machinery of what you might call the Atlantic consensus – the World Bank, the IMF, GATT, G7 or G8 – was conceived and rooted in the assumption that the global economic and political order could and would indeed be governed largely by the Atlantic world. That assumption now no longer holds. There has been a reorientation from the Atlantic to the Pacific and beyond. Now, the multilateral institutions that survive, therefore, will be those ones that are able to adapt to this new 21st century landscape. The second simple reality that I would identify for you is that economic globalization means interdependence. This is not simply a question of global supply chains and production lines. Our open markets are a ladder out of poverty for the developing world. Their growing markets are a source of growth for us. That is the fundamental interdependence that links and joins us and our interests together in the global economy. A world of growing prosperity and economic integration is a more stable world, even if it doesn’t always feel that way Now, for that reason, multilateral institutions in the multilateral trading system will matter more than ever in the new global age of the 21st century. There is no going it alone in this century, in this global age. Interdependence doesn’t allow going it alone in the way that we have tried to practice or imagine it was possible in the past. Our ability to get things done multilaterally will define the extent to which we can shape globalization in a way that makes it equitable and sustainable and binds in the big new players who are emerging in that global economy. It will certainly define the extent to which we can confront huge pressing problems such as global warming, migration, nuclear proliferation, and energy security.<br />
Warming is real, anthropogenic, and the largest risk of extinction<br />
Deibel ‘7 (Terry L. Deibel, professor of IR at National War College, Foreign Affairs Strategy, “Conclusion: American Foreign Affairs Strategy Today Anthropogenic – caused by CO2”)<br />
Finally, there is one major existential threat to American security (as well as prosperity) of a nonviolent nature, which, though far in the future, demands urgent action. It is the threat of global warming to the stability of the climate upon which all earthly life depends. Scientists worldwide have been observing the gathering of this threat for three decades now, and what was once a mere possibility has passed through probability to near certainty. Indeed not one of more than 900 articles on climate change published in refereed scientific journals from 1993 to 2003 doubted that anthropogenic warming is occurring. “In legitimate scientific circles,” writes Elizabeth Kolbert, “it is virtually impossible to find evidence of disagreement over the fundamentals of global warming.” Evidence from a vast international scientific monitoring effort accumulates almost weekly, as this sample of newspaper reports shows: an international panel predicts “brutal droughts, floods and violent storms across the planet over the next century”; climate change could “literally alter ocean currents, wipe away huge portions of Alpine Snowcaps and aid the spread of cholera and malaria”; “glaciers in the Antarctic and in Greenland are melting much faster than expected, and…worldwide, plants are blooming several days earlier than a decade ago”; “rising sea temperatures have been accompanied by a significant global increase in the most destructive hurricanes”; “NASA scientists have concluded from direct temperature measurements that 2005 was the hottest year on record, with 1998 a close second”; “Earth’s warming climate is estimated to contribute to more than 150,000 deaths and 5 million illnesses each year” as disease spreads; “widespread bleaching from Texas to Trinidad…killed broad swaths of corals” due to a 2-degree rise in sea temperatures. “The world is slowly disintegrating,” concluded Inuit hunter Noah Metuq, who lives 30 miles from the Arctic Circle. “They call it climate change…but we just call it breaking up.” From the founding of the first cities some 6,000 years ago until the beginning of the industrial revolution, carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere remained relatively constant at about 280 parts per million (ppm). At present they are accelerating toward 400 ppm, and by 2050 they will reach 500 ppm, about double pre-industrial levels. Unfortunately, atmospheric CO2 lasts about a century, so there is no way immediately to reduce levels, only to slow their increase, we are thus in for significant global warming; the only debate is how much and how serous the effects will be. As the newspaper stories quoted above show, we are already experiencing the effects of 1-2 degree warming in more violent storms, spread of disease, mass die offs of plants and animals, species extinction, and threatened inundation of low-lying countries like the Pacific nation of Kiribati and the Netherlands at a warming of 5 degrees or less the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets could disintegrate, leading to a sea level of rise of 20 feet that would cover North Carolina’s outer banks, swamp the southern third of Florida, and inundate Manhattan up to the middle of Greenwich Village. Another catastrophic effect would be the collapse of the Atlantic thermohaline circulation that keeps the winter weather in Europe far warmer than its latitude would otherwise allow. Economist William Cline once estimated the damage to the United States alone from moderate levels of warming at 1-6 percent of GDP annually; severe warming could cost 13-26 percent of GDP. But the most frightening scenario is runaway greenhouse warming, based on positive feedback from the buildup of water vapor in the atmosphere that is both caused by and causes hotter surface temperatures. Past ice age transitions, associated with only 5-10 degree changes in average global temperatures, took place in just decades, even though no one was then pouring ever-increasing amounts of carbon into the atmosphere. Faced with this specter, the best one can conclude is that “humankind’s continuing enhancement of the natural greenhouse effect is akin to playing Russian roulette with the earth’s climate and humanity’s life support system. At worst, says physics professor Marty Hoffert of New York University, “we’re just going to burn everything up; we’re going to het the atmosphere to the temperature it was in the Cretaceous when there were crocodiles at the poles, and then everything will collapse.” During the Cold War, astronomer Carl Sagan popularized a theory of nuclear winter to describe how a thermonuclear war between the Untied States and the Soviet Union would not only destroy both countries but possible end life on this planet. Global warming is the post-Cold War era’s equivalent of nuclear winter at least as serious and considerably better supported scientifically. Over the long run it puts dangers form terrorism and traditional military challenges to shame. It is a threat not only to the security and prosperity to the United States, but potentially to the continued existence of life on this planet.<br />
Proliferations causes extinction – nuclear arms races and miscalculated nuclear war.<br />
Utgoff, Deputy Director at Institute for Defense Analysis, 2 [Victor, Deputy Director of the Strategy, Forces, and Resources Division of the Institute for Defense Analysis, Survival, “Proliferation, Missile Defence and American Ambitions” 2002 p. 87-90]<br />
Further, the large number of states that became capable of building nuclear weapons over the years, but chose not to, can be reasonably well explained by the fact that most were formally allied with either the United States or the Soviet Union. Both these superpowers had strong nuclear forces and put great pressure on their allies not to build nuclear weapons. Since the Cold War, the US has retained all its allies. In addition, NATO has extended its protection to some of the previous allies of the Soviet Union and plans on taking in more. Nuclear proliferation by India and Pakistan, and proliferation programmes by North Korea, Iran and Iraq, all involve states in the opposite situation: all judged that they faced serious military opposition and had little prospect of establishing a reliable supporting alliance with a suitably strong, nuclear-armed state. What would await the world if strong protectors, especially the United States, were [was] no longer seen as willing to protect states from nuclear-backed aggression? At least a few additional states would begin to build their own nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them to distant targets, and these initiatives would spur increasing numbers of the world’s capable states to follow suit. Restraint would seem ever less necessary and ever more dangerous. Meanwhile, more states are becoming capable of building nuclear weapons and long-range missiles. Many, perhaps most, of the world’s states are becoming sufficiently wealthy, and the technology for building nuclear forces continues to improve and spread. Finally, it seems highly likely that at some point, halting proliferation will come to be seen as a lost cause and the restraints on it will disappear. Once that happens, the transition to a highly proliferated world would probably be very rapid. While some regions might be able to hold the line for a time, the threats posed by wildfire proliferation in most other areas could create pressures that would finally overcome all restraint. Many readers are probably willing to accept that nuclear proliferation is such a grave threat to world peace that every effort should be made to avoid it. However, every effort has not been made in the past, and we are talking about much more substantial efforts now. For new and substantially more burdensome efforts to be made to slow or stop nuclear proliferation, it needs to be established that the highly proliferated nuclear world that would sooner or later evolve without such efforts is not going to be acceptable. And, for many reasons, it is not. First, the dynamics of getting to a highly proliferated world could be very dangerous. Proliferating states will feel great pressures to obtain nuclear weapons and delivery systems before any potential opponent does. Those who succeed in outracing an opponent may consider preemptive nuclear war before the opponent becomes capable of nuclear retaliation. Those who lag behind might try to preempt their opponent’s nuclear programme or defeat the opponent using conventional forces. And those who feel threatened but are incapable of building nuclear weapons may still be able to join in this arms race by building other types of weapons of mass destruction, such as biological weapons. Second, as the world approaches complete proliferation, the hazards posed by nuclear weapons today will be magnified many times over. Fifty or more nations capable of launching nuclear weapons means that the risk of nuclear accidents that could cause serious damage not only to their own populations and environments, but those of others, is hugely increased. The chances of such weapons failing into the hands of renegade military units or terrorists is far greater, as is the number of nations carrying out hazardous manufacturing and storage activities. Worse still, in a highly proliferated world there would be more frequent opportunities for the use of nuclear weapons. And more frequent opportunities means shorter expected times between conflicts in which nuclear weapons get used, unless the probability of use at any opportunity is actually zero. To be sure, some theorists on nuclear deterrence appear to think that in any confrontation between two states known to have reliable nuclear capabilities, the probability of nuclear weapons being used is zero.’ These theorists think that such states will be so fearful of escalation to nuclear war that they would always avoid or terminate confrontations between them, short of even conventional war. They believe this to be true even if the two states have different cultures or leaders with very eccentric personalities. History and human nature, however, suggest that they are almost surely wrong. History includes instances in which states ‘known to possess nuclear weapons did engage in direct conventional conflict. China and Russia fought battles along their common border even after both had nuclear weapons. Moreover, logic suggests that if states with nuclear weapons always avoided conflict with one another, surely states without nuclear weapons would avoid conflict with states that had them. Again, history provides counter-examples Egypt attacked Israel in 1973 even though it saw Israel as a nuclear power at the time. Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands and fought Britain’s efforts to take them back, even though Britain had nuclear weapons. Those who claim that two states with reliable nuclear capabilities to devastate each other will not engage in conventional conflict risking nuclear war also assume that any leader from any culture would not choose suicide for his nation. But history provides unhappy examples of states whose leaders were ready to choose suicide for themselves and their fellow citizens. Hitler tried to impose a ‘victory or destruction’’ policy on his people as Nazi Germany was going down to defeat. And Japan’s war minister, during debates on how to respond to the American atomic bombing, suggested ‘Would it not be wondrous for the whole nation to be destroyed like a beautiful flower?” If leaders are willing to engage in conflict with nuclear-armed nations, use of nuclear weapons in any particular instance may not be likely, but its probability would still be dangerously significant. In particular, human nature suggests that the threat of retaliation with nuclear weapons is not a reliable guarantee against a disastrous first use of these weapons. While national leaders and their advisors everywhere are usually talented and experienced people, even their most important decisions cannot be counted on to be the product of well-informed and thorough assessments of all options from all relevant points of view. This is especially so when the stakes are so large as to defy assessment and there are substantial pressures to act quickly, as could be expected in intense and fast-moving crises between nuclear-armed states. Instead, like other human beings, national leaders can be seduced by wishful thinking. They can misinterpret the words or actions of opposing leaders. Their advisors may produce answers that they think the leader wants to hear, or coalesce around what they know is an inferior decision because the group urgently needs the confidence or the sharing of responsibility that results from settling on something. Moreover, leaders may not recognize clearly where their personal or party interests diverge from those of their citizens. Under great stress, human beings can lose their ability to think carefully. They can refuse to believe that the worst could really happen, oversimplify the problem at hand, think in terms of simplistic analogies and play hunches. The intuitive rules for how individuals should respond to insults or signs of weakness in an opponent may too readily suggest a rash course of action. Anger, fear, greed, ambition and pride can all lead to bad decisions. The desire for a decisive solution to the problem at hand may lead to an unnecessarily extreme course of action. We can almost hear the kinds of words that could flow from discussions in nuclear crises or war. ‘These people are not willing to die for this interest’. ‘No sane person would actually use such weapons’. ‘Perhaps the opponent will back down if we show him we mean business by demonstrating a willingness to use nuclear weapons’. ‘If I don’t hit them back really hard, I am going to be driven from office, if not killed’. Whether right or wrong, in the stressful atmosphere of a nuclear crisis or war, such words from others, or silently from within, might resonate too readily with a harried leader. Thus, both history and human nature suggest that nuclear deterrence can be expected to fail from time to time, and we are fortunate it has not happened yet. But the threat of nuclear war is not just a matter of a few weapons being used. It could get much worse. Once a conflict reaches the point where nuclear weapons are employed, the stresses felt by the leaderships would rise enormously. These stresses can be expected to further degrade their decision-making. The pressures to force the enemy to stop fighting or to surrender could argue for more forceful and decisive military action, which might be the right thing to do in the circumstances, but maybe not. And the horrors of the carnage already suffered may be seen as justification for visiting the most devastating punishment possible on the enemy.’ Again, history demonstrates how intense conflict can lead the combatants to escalate violence to the maximum possible levels. In the Second World War, early promises not to bomb cities soon gave way to essentially indiscriminate bombing of civilians. The war between Iran and Iraq during the 1980s led to the use of chemical weapons on both sides and exchanges of missiles against each other’s cities. And more recently, violence in the Middle East escalated in a few months from rocks and small arms to heavy weapons on one side, and from police actions to air strikes and armoured attacks on the other. Escalation of violence is also basic human nature. Once the violence starts, retaliatory exchanges of violent acts can escalate to levels unimagined by the participants before hand. Intense and blinding anger is a common response to fear or humiliation or abuse. And such anger can lead us to impose on our opponents whatever levels of violence are readily accessible. In sum, widespread proliferation is likely to lead to an occasional shoot-out with nuclear weapons, and that such shoot-outs will have a substantial probability of escalating to the maximum destruction possible with the weapons at hand. Unless nuclear proliferation is stopped, we are headed toward a world that will mirror the American Wild West of the late 1800s. With most, if not all, nations wearing nuclear 'six-shooters' on their hips, the world may even be a more polite place than it is today, but every once in a while we will all gather on a hill to bury the bodies of dead cities or even whole nations.<br />
Contention 4: Heg<br />
Entitlement deficits will kill heg and the military – historically proven<br />
Ferguson ‘9 (Niall, History Professor at Harvard, 12-7-9, “An Empire at Risk,” Newsweek)<br />
Size matters, of course. For the smaller countries, the financial losses arising from this crisis are a great deal larger in relation to their gross domestic product than they are for the United States. Yet the stakes are higher in the American case. In the great scheme of things—let's be frank—it does not matter much if Iceland teeters on the brink of fiscal collapse, or Ireland, for that matter. The locals suffer, but the world goes on much as usual. But if the United States succumbs to a fiscal crisis, as an increasing number of economic experts fear it may, then the entire balance of global economic power could shift. Military experts talk as if the president's decision about whether to send an additional 40,000 troops to Afghanistan is a make-or-break moment. In reality, his indecision about the deficit could matter much more for the country's long-term national security. Call the United States what you like—superpower, hegemon, or empire—but its ability to manage its finances is closely tied to its ability to remain the predominant global military power. Here's why. The disciples of John Maynard Keynes argue that increasing the federal debt by roughly a third was necessary to avoid Depression 2.0. Well, maybe, though some would say the benefits of fiscal stimulus have been oversold and that the magic multiplier (which is supposed to transform $1 of government spending into a lot more than $1 of aggregate demand) is trivially small. Credit where it's due. The positive number for third-quarter growth in the United States would have been a lot lower without government spending. Between half and two thirds of the real increase in gross domestic product was attributable to government programs, especially the Cash for Clunkers scheme and the subsidy to first-time home buyers. But we are still a very long way from a self--sustaining recovery. The third-quarter growth number has just been revised downward from 3.5 percent to 2.8 percent. And that's not wholly surprising. Remember, what makes a stimulus actually work is the change in borrowing by the whole public sector. Since the federal government was already running deficits, and since the states are actually raising taxes and cutting spending, the actual size of the stimulus is closer to 4 percent of GDP spread over the years 2007 to 2010—a lot less than that headline 11.2 percent deficit. Meanwhile, let's consider the cost of this muted stimulus. The deficit for the fiscal year 2009 came in at more than $1.4 trillion—about 11.2 percent of GDP, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). That's a bigger deficit than any seen in the past 60 years—only slightly larger in relative terms than the deficit in 1942. We are, it seems, having the fiscal policy of a world war, without the war. Yes, I know, the United States is at war in Afghanistan and still has a significant contingent of troops in Iraq. But these are trivial conflicts compared with the world wars, and their contribution to the gathering fiscal storm has in fact been quite modest (little more than 1.8 percent of GDP, even if you accept the estimated cumulative cost of $3.2 trillion published by Columbia economist Joseph Stiglitz in February 2008). And that $1.4 trillion is just for starters. According to the CBO's most recent projections, the federal deficit will decline from 11.2 percent of GDP this year to 9.6 percent in 2010, 6.1 percent in 2011, and 3.7 percent in 2012. After that it will stay above 3 percent for the foreseeable future. Meanwhile, in dollar terms, the total debt held by the public (excluding government agencies, but including foreigners) rises from $5.8 trillion in 2008 to $14.3 trillion in 2019—from 41 percent of GDP to 68 percent. In other words, there is no end in sight to the borrowing binge. Unless entitlements are cut or taxes are raised, there will never be another balanced budget. Let's assume I live another 30 years and follow my grandfathers to the grave at about 75. By 2039, when I shuffle off this mortal coil, the federal debt held by the public will have reached 91 percent of GDP, according to the CBO's extended baseline projections. Nothing to worry about, retort -deficit-loving economists like Paul Krugman. In 1945, the figure was 113 percent. Well, let's leave aside the likely huge differences between the United States in 1945 and in 2039. Consider the simple fact that under the CBO's alternative (i.e., more pessimistic) fiscal scenario, the debt could hit 215 percent by 2039. That's right: more than double the annual output of the entire U.S. economy. Forecasting anything that far ahead is not about predicting the future. Everything hinges on the assumptions you make about demographics, Medicare costs, and a bunch of other variables. For example, the CBO assumes an average annual real GDP growth rate of 2.3 percent over the next 30 years. The point is to show the implications of the current chronic imbalance between federal spending and federal revenue. And the implication is clear. Under no plausible scenario does the debt burden decline. Under one of two plausible scenarios it explodes by a factor of nearly five in relation to economic output. Another way of doing this kind of exercise is to calculate the net present value of the unfunded liabilities of the Social Security and Medicare systems. One recent estimate puts them at about $104 trillion, 10 times the stated federal debt. No sweat, reply the Keynesians. We can easily finance $1 trillion a year of new government debt. Just look at the way Japan's households and financial institutions funded the explosion of Japanese public debt (up to 200 percent of GDP) during the two &quot;lost decades&quot; of near-zero growth that began in 1990. Unfortunately for this argument, the evidence to support it is lacking. American households were, in fact, net sellers of Treasuries in the second quarter of 2009, and on a massive scale. Purchases by mutual funds were modest ($142 billion), while purchases by pension funds and insurance companies were trivial ($12 billion and $10 billion, respectively). The key, therefore, becomes the banks. Currently, according to the Bridgewater hedge fund, U.S. banks' asset allocation to government bonds is about 13 percent, which is relatively low by historical standards. If they raised that proportion back to where it was in the early 1990s, it's conceivable they could absorb &quot;about $250 billion a year of government bond purchases.&quot; But that's a big &quot;if.&quot; Data for October showed commercial banks selling Treasuries. That just leaves two potential buyers: the Federal Reserve, which bought the bulk of Treasuries issued in the second quarter; and foreigners, who bought $380 billion. Morgan Stanley's analysts have crunched the numbers and concluded that, in the year ending June 2010, there could be a shortfall in demand on the order of $598 billion—about a third of projected new issuance. Of course, our friends in Beijing could ride to the rescue by increasing their already vast holdings of U.S. government debt. For the past five years or so, they have been amassing dollar--denominated international reserves in a wholly unprecedented way, mainly as a result of their interventions to prevent the Chinese currency from appreciating against the dollar. Right now, the People's Republic of China holds about 13 percent of U.S. government bonds and notes in public hands. At the peak of this process of reserve accumulation, back in 2007, it was absorbing as much as 75 percent of monthly Treasury issuance. But there's no such thing as a free lunch in the realm of international finance. According to Fred Bergsten of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, if this trend were to continue, the U.S. -current-account deficit could rise to 15 percent of GDP by 2030, and its net debt to the rest of the world could hit 140 percent of GDP. In such a scenario, the U.S. would have to pay as much as 7 percent of GDP every year to foreigners to service its external borrowings. Could that happen? I doubt it. For one thing, the Chinese keep grumbling that they have far too many Treasuries already. For another, a significant dollar depreciation seems more probable, since the United States is in the lucky position of being able to borrow in its own currency, which it reserves the right to print in any quantity the Federal Reserve chooses. Now, who said the following? &quot;My prediction is that politicians will eventually be tempted to resolve the [fiscal] crisis the way irresponsible governments usually do: by printing money, both to pay current bills and to inflate away debt. And as that temptation becomes obvious, interest rates will soar.&quot; Seems pretty reasonable to me. The surprising thing is that this was none other than Paul Krugman, the high priest of Keynesianism, writing back in March 2003. A year and a half later he was comparing the U.S. deficit with Argentina's (at a time when it was 4.5 percent of GDP). Has the economic situation really changed so drastically that now the same Krugman believes it was &quot;deficits that saved us,&quot; and wants to see an even larger deficit next year? Perhaps. But it might just be that the party in power has changed. History strongly supports the proposition that major financial crises are followed by major fiscal crises. &quot;On average,&quot; write Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff in their new book, This Time Is Different, &quot;government debt rises by 86 percent during the three years following a banking crisis.&quot; In the wake of these debt explosions, one of two things can happen: either a default, usually when the debt is in a foreign currency, or a bout of high inflation that catches the creditors out. The history of all the great European empires is replete with such episodes. Indeed, serial default and high inflation have tended to be the surest symptoms of imperial decline. As the U.S. is unlikely to default on its debt, since it's all in dollars, the key question, therefore, is whether we are going to see the Fed &quot;printing money&quot;—buying newly minted Treasuries in exchange for even more newly minted greenbacks—followed by the familiar story of rising prices and declining real-debt burdens. It's a scenario many investors around the world fear. That is why they are selling dollars. That is why they are buying gold. Yet from where I am sitting, inflation is a pretty remote prospect. With U.S. unemployment above 10 percent, labor unions relatively weak, and huge quantities of unused capacity in global manufacturing, there are none of the pressures that made for stagflation (low growth plus high prices) in the 1970s. Public expectations of inflation are also very stable, as far as can be judged from poll data and the difference between the yields on regular and inflation-protected bonds. So here's another scenario—which in many ways is worse than the inflation scenario. What happens is that we get a rise in the real interest rate, which is the actual interest rate minus inflation. According to a substantial amount of empirical research by economists, including Peter Orszag (now at the Office of Management and Budget), significant increases in the debt-to-GDP ratio tend to increase the real interest rate. One recent study concluded that &quot;a 20 percentage point increase in the U.S. government-debt-to-GDP ratio should lead to a 20–120 basis points [0.2–1.2 percent] increase in real interest rates.&quot; This can happen in one of three ways: the nominal interest rate rises and inflation stays the same; the nominal rate stays the same and inflation falls; or—the nightmare case—the nominal interest rate rises and inflation falls. Today's Keynesians deny that this can happen. But the historical evidence is against them. There are a number of past cases (e.g., France in the 1930s) when nominal rates have risen even at a time of deflation. What's more, it seems to be happening in Japan right now. Just last week Hirohisa Fujii, Japan's new finance minister, admitted that he was &quot;highly concerned&quot; about the recent rise in Japanese government bond yields. In the very same week, the government admitted that Japan was back in deflation after three years of modest price increases. It's not inconceivable that something similar could happen to the United States. Foreign investors might ask for a higher nominal return on U.S. Treasuries to compensate them for the weakening dollar. And inflation might continue to surprise us on the downside. After all, consumer price inflation is in negative territory right now. Why should we fear rising real interest rates ahead of inflation? The answer is that for a heavily indebted government and an even more heavily indebted public, they mean an increasingly heavy debt-service burden. The relatively short duration (maturity) of most of these debts means that a large share has to be rolled over each year. That means any rise in rates would feed through the system scarily fast. Already, the federal government's interest payments are forecast by the CBO to rise from 8 percent of revenues in 2009 to 17 percent by 2019, even if rates stay low and growth resumes. If rates rise even slightly and the economy flatlines, we'll get to 20 percent much sooner. And history suggests that once you are spending as much as a fifth of your revenues on debt service, you have a problem. It's all too easy to find yourself in a vicious circle of diminishing credibility. The investors don't believe you can afford your debts, so they charge higher interest, which makes your position even worse. This matters more for a superpower than for a small Atlantic island for one very simple reason. As interest payments eat into the budget, something has to give—and that something is nearly always defense expenditure. According to the CBO, a significant decline in the relative share of national security in the federal budget is already baked into the cake. On the Pentagon's present plan, defense spending is set to fall from above 4 percent now to 3.2 percent of GDP in 2015 and to 2.6 percent of GDP by 2028. Over the longer run, to my own estimated departure date of 2039, spending on health care rises from 16 percent to 33 percent of GDP (some of the money presumably is going to keep me from expiring even sooner). But spending on everything other than health, Social Security, and interest payments drops from 12 percent to 8.4 percent. This is how empires decline. It begins with a debt explosion. It ends with an inexorable reduction in the resources available for the Army, Navy, and Air Force. Which is why voters are right to worry about America's debt crisis. According to a recent Rasmussen report, 42 percent of Americans now say that cutting the deficit in half by the end of the president's first term should be the administration's most important task—significantly more than the 24 percent who see health-care reform as the No. 1 priority. But cutting the deficit in half is simply not enough. If the United States doesn't come up soon with a credible plan to restore the federal budget to balance over the next five to 10 years, the danger is very real that a debt crisis could lead to a major weakening of American power. The precedents are certainly there. Habsburg Spain defaulted on all or part of its debt 14 times between 1557 and 1696 and also succumbed to inflation due to a surfeit of New World silver. Prerevolutionary France was spending 62 percent of royal revenue on debt service by 1788. The Ottoman Empire went the same way: interest payments and amortization rose from 15 percent of the budget in 1860 to 50 percent in 1875. And don't forget the last great English-speaking empire. By the interwar years, interest payments were consuming 44 percent of the British budget, making it intensely difficult to rearm in the face of a new German threat. Call it the fatal arithmetic of imperial decline. Without radical fiscal reform, it could apply to America next.<br />

Planet Earth’s critical issue this decade will be whether American power will erode — and if so, what the implications will be for the liberal world order we erected after WWII. The Obama administration’s fiscal stimulus package cum bank bailout, building on the Paulson-Bush-Geithner-Bernanke efforts of 2008 and the unprecedented coordination of economic policy globally, constituted a brilliant, stage-managed rescue of our planet, nothing less. However, such a Herculean effort has created its own problems — huge debts, gaping goverment deficits, and a government intrusion in the economy that will be hard to reverse. As yet, no plans to solve these problems have been offered. Students of power and prosperity from Paul Kennedy on down know that imperial overextension accelerates the decline of great powers. From this dynamic, the US is not immune. While the relative decline of the US has been in place since the 1950s, its rapidity and consequences are far from inevitable. A too precipitous, disorderly, angry decline that would occur if America does not right its fiscal ship soon would not only injure American prosperity, but would also put at risk our global institutions — the UN, the IMF and World Bank, NATO, the WTO, the G-20, etc. These institutions have fostered cooperation and peaceful solutions to the world’s problems. The symbolic end to this Pax Americana, which has raised billions out of poverty and offered countless millions broader political participation, could be the loss of the AAA rating on US government bonds. According to Brian Coulton, head of Global Economics at Fitch Ratings, this could occur later this decade if an aggressive fiscal consolidation program is not implemented by the Obama administration (see note below). A narrow tax base, low discretionary spending (the kind of spending that is easiest to cut) and huge entitlements — including the $900 billion health “reform” up on Capitol Hill, the continued current account deficits in spite of sluggish GDP growth, and our dependence on foreigners for financing together spell a potentially rapid decline of America’s place in the world.<br />
Social welfare makes isolationism inevitable<br />
Mandlebaum ‘5 (Michael, professor in the School of Advanced International studies at Johns Hopkins, The Case for Goliath, p, 184-186)<br />
.<br />
The huge bill for entitlements as the twenty-first century proceeds will compel either a very steep rise in the taxes younger Americans pay or a sharp reduction in the benefits older Americans receive, or, what is most likely, both. Neither will be popular. The mark of this unpopularity is the fact that although the fiscal problems the aging of the baby boomers will pose have long been well known, candidates for political office, who have the ultimate responsibility for coping with these problems, have virtually ignored them.72 The required tax increases and cuts in benefits are likely to be substantial enough to affect the context in which public policy is made. The entitlements explosion, especially in conjunction with rising energy costs but even without these, will create a new political climate in the United States, and in this new climate the international services that the country came to provide during and after the Cold War are not necessarily destined to flourish. Democracies favor butter over guns.73 The ultimate responsibility for the society's resources rests with the people themselves, and most people see to their own immediate well-being before concerning themselves with events beyond their borders.74 The founding document of the American republic, the Declaration of Independence of 1776, announced that all persons have certain fundamental rights, which the independent country the signers proposed to build would guarantee, namely &quot;life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness&quot;-presumably individual happiness. The document did not mention international stability or global prosperity as goals to which the new country would devote itself. As the provision of welfare becomes more expensive and therefore more controversial, other public programs, especially those involving other countries and not clearly connected to the physical safety of Americans, may well lose political support. Under these circumstances it will become increasingly difficult for the foreign policy elite to persuade the wider public to support the kinds of policies that, collectively, make up the American role as the world's government. Foreign policy will be relegated to the back burner, regarded as less worthy of concern and attention than the government's financial obligations to its own citizens.<br />
Entitlement spending will lead to isolationism, which causes power vacuums<br />
Holmes ‘9 (Kim, Vice President at the Heritage Foundation &amp; former Assistant Secretary of State, 10-29-9, “Massive debt will drive America's decline,” Washington Times)<br />
Other ruinous scenarios are possible as well. Suppose foreigners refuse to buy U.S. debt, leading to debt-induced inflation that eats away at productivity and the currency. In this situation, Americans could completely lose confidence in protecting our interests abroad. Beset by inflation and other towering economic problems, Americans could understandably turn toward isolationism, as they had by the 1930s. This would create power vacuums around the world and unleash enemies bent on challenging the great &quot;sick man of America.&quot; It has happened before. A great many nations have walked the slow road of decline, and in almost all cases -- from the Roman Empire, to Louis XIV's France, to the British Empire -- huge debt played a crucial role. In those cases, decline was ushered in by the expense of large armies or grand building excesses like the Palace of Versailles. But an American decline would have a different root: runaway social entitlement spending. That's the main cause of our massive debt. A descent down this path of decline is not inevitable, but it is a path that may be chosen freely by a people unable to understand the relationship between government debt and the means required to preserve America's unique position in the world. No other country on earth can protect those sea lanes or keep a hegemonic power from dominating a continent. No other country can destroy a terrorist-haven regime. And no other country can field a strategic missile defense system to protect us and our allies. Should Spain or Germany be attacked like we were on 9/11, they would have only two options: call Washington for help, or file a complaint with the United Nations. Americans should never want to be in such a position. For Americans, our nation's great power status is not an option; it's a necessity. There is no other great power to bail us out if we get into trouble. If you think this is an exaggeration, think again. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that just 10 years from now, the president's budget would nearly double our national debt, to more than 82 percent of what the economy produces every year. Interest payments on this debt alone will amount to $100 billion more than the entire budget for the Defense Department. Just imagine what those numbers will be by 2035. Now imagine the pressure that will put on the defense budget. In 1965, mandatory spending consumed over a third of the federal budget. Today, it eats up approximately two-thirds. At this rate, if nothing changes, in just 19 years there will be nothing left over in the discretionary budget -- and that's where we get funding for our armed forces. In a very real sense, the safety of every American, and their freedom to vote and live their lives unmolested from foreign threats, depend on our country's sustained ability to project power against our enemies no matter where they are. It's truly the only thing that completely sets us apart from other nations.<br />
Nuclear war and intervention would become inevitable<br />
Lieber ‘5 (Robert J. Lieber, Professor of Government and International Affairs @ Georgetown University, 2005 The American Era: Power and Strategy for the 21st Century p 53-4)<br />
Withdrawal from foreign commitments might seem to be a means of evading hostility toward the United States, but the consequences would almost certainly be harmful both to regional stability and to U.S. national interests. Although Europe would almost certainly not see the return to competitive balancing among regional powers (i.e., competition and even military rivalry between France and Germany) of the kind that some realist scholars of international relations have predicted,&quot; elsewhere the dangers could increase. In Asia, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan would have strong motivation to acquire nuclear weapons – which they have the technological capacity to do quite quickly. Instability and regional competition could also escalate, not only between India and Pakistan, but also in Southeast Asia involving Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, and possibly the Philippines. Risks in the Middle East would be likely to increase, with regional competition among the major countries of the Gulf region (Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq) as well as Egypt, Syria, and Israel. Major regional wars, eventually involving the use of Weapons Of Mass Destruction plus human suffering on a vast scale, floods of refugees, economic disruption, and risks to oil supplies are all readily conceivable. Based on past experience, the United States would almost certainly be drawn back into these areas, whether to defend friendly states, to cope with a humanitarian catastrophe, or to prevent a hostile power from dominating an entire region. Steven Peter Rosen has thus fit-tingly observed, &quot;If the logic of American empire is unappealing, it is not at all clear that the alternatives are that much more attractive.&quot;2z Similarly, Niall Ferguson has added that those who dislike American predominance ought to bear in mind that the alternative may not be a world of competing great powers, but one with no hegemon at all. Ferguson's warning may be hyperbolic, but it hints at the perils that the absence of a dominant power, &quot;apolarity,&quot; could bring &quot;an anarchic new Dark Age of waning empires and religious fanaticism; of endemic plunder and pillage in the world's forgotten regions; of economic stagnation and civilization's retreat into a few fortified enclaves.&quot;2<br />
Contention 5: Protectionism<br />
The growing US budget deficit is causing declining wages, sparking a widespread backlash against free trade policies.<br />
Rial ’9 (Patrick, “U.S. debt scenario may cause “fall of Rome” scenario, Duncan says,” 9/22, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aJ6jnKWHrQgI" rel="nofollow">http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aJ6jnKWHrQgI</a>)<br />
In “The Dollar Crisis,” first published in 2003, Duncan argued that persistent current account deficits by the U.S. were creating an unsustainable boom in global credit that was destined to break down, resulting in a worldwide recession. “The bad news is at the end of a 10-year period we’re still not going to have fixed the problem,” Duncan said in an interview in Hong Kong yesterday. “Eventually it will lead to high rates of inflation well down the line and really destabilize things to the point where there may be irreparable damage. A kind of ‘Fall of Rome’ scenario.” The federal budget deficit will total $1.6 trillion this year, while combined shortfalls are forecast to total $9.05 trillion in the next 10 years, according to projections from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The U.S. has run a current account deficit every year since 1982 except one, with a peak of $788 billion in 2006. Foreign purchases of U.S. debt has propped up the dollar and allowed a credit-fueled spending boom by the nation’s consumers, according to Duncan. Falling Wages U.S. workers are now likely to face declining wages and that may create a political backlash against free-trade policies, he said. The nation’s jobless rate jumped to a 26-year high of 9.7 percent in August, while wages logged a 2.6 percent increase from the previous year. “As unemployment remains above 10 percent well into the foreseeable future, it won’t be long before Americans start voting for protectionism,” Duncan said. “That’s going to be bad because protectionism will mean world trade will diminish and will overall reduce global prosperity.” Once the U.S. debt burden becomes too large and the government can no longer sell debt to the public the Federal Reserve will likely step in and monetize it, resulting in high levels of inflation, he said. Economic Crisis The MSCI World Index plunged by a record 42 percent last year as the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. triggered a credit crunch that forced financial institutions to post more than $1.6 trillion in losses and writedowns. As an analyst, Duncan began warning of imbalances in Thailand’s economy in 1993 that eventually led to the devaluation of the baht in 1997 and a regional economic crisis. The nation’s SET Index dropped as much as 88 percent from its 1994 peak to a low in 1998. Prior to joining Blackhorse, Duncan was the head of investment strategy at ABN Amro Asset Management. He has also held positions at James Capel, Indosuez W.I. Carr and Salomon Brothers.<br />
Nuclear war<br />
Panzner 8, faculty at the New York Institute of Finance, 25-year veteran of the global stock, bond, and currency markets who has worked in New York and London for HSBC, Soros Funds, ABN Amro, Dresdner Bank, and JPMorgan Chase (Michael, Financial Armageddon: Protect Your Future from Economic Collapse, Revised and Updated Edition, p. 136-138, googlebooks)<br />
Continuing calls for curbs on the flow of finance and trade will inspire the United States and other nations to spew forth protectionist legislation like the notorious Smoot-Hawley bill. Introduced at the start of the Great Depression, it triggered a series of tit-for-tat economic responses, which many commentators believe helped turn a serious economic downturn into a prolonged and devastating global disaster, But if history is any guide, those lessons will have been long forgotten during the next collapse. Eventually, fed by a mood of desperation and growing public anger, restrictions on trade, finance, investment, and immigration will almost certainly intensify.<br />
Authorities and ordinary citizens will likely scrutinize the cross-border movement of Americans and outsiders alike, and lawmakers may even call for a general crackdown on nonessential travel. Meanwhile, many nations will make transporting or sending funds to other countries exceedingly difficult. As desperate officials try to limit the fallout from decades of ill-conceived, corrupt, and reckless policies, they will introduce controls on foreign exchange, foreign individuals and companies seeking to acquire certain American infrastructure assets, or trying to buy property and other assets on the (heap thanks to a rapidly depreciating dollar, will be stymied by limits on investment by noncitizens. Those efforts will cause spasms to ripple across economies and markets, disrupting global payment, settlement, and clearing mechanisms. All of this will, of course, continue to undermine business confidence and consumer spending.<br />
In a world of lockouts and lockdowns, any link that transmits systemic financial pressures across markets through arbitrage or portfolio-based risk management, or that allows diseases to be easily spread from one country to the next by tourists and wildlife, or that otherwise facilitates unwelcome exchanges of any kind will be viewed with suspicion and dealt with accordingly.<br />
The rise in isolationism and protectionism will bring about ever more heated arguments and dangerous confrontations over shared sources of oil, gas, and other key commodities as well as factors of production that must, out of necessity, be acquired from less-than-friendly nations. Whether involving raw materials used in strategic industries or basic necessities such as food, water, and energy, efforts to secure adequate supplies will take increasing precedence in a world where demand seems constantly out of kilter with supply. Disputes over the misuse, overuse, and pollution of the environment and natural resources will become more commonplace. Around the world, such tensions will give rise to full-scale military encounters, often with minimal provocation.<br />
In some instances, economic conditions will serve as a convenient pretext for conflicts that stem from cultural and religious differences. Alternatively, nations may look to divert attention away from domestic problems by channeling frustration and populist sentiment toward other countries and cultures. Enabled by cheap technology and the waning threat of American retribution, terrorist groups will likely boost the frequency and scale of their horrifying attacks, bringing the threat of random violence to a whole new level.<br />
Turbulent conditions will encourage aggressive saber rattling and interdictions by rogue nations running amok. Age-old clashes will also take on a new, more healed sense of urgency. China will likely assume an increasingly belligerent posture toward Taiwan, while Iran may embark on overt colonization of its neighbors in the Mideast. Israel, for its part, may look to draw a dwindling list of allies from around the world into a growing number of conflicts. Some observers, like John Mearsheimer, a political scientist at the University of Chicago, have even speculated that an &quot;intense confrontation&quot; between the United States and China is &quot;inevitable&quot; at some point.<br />
More than a few disputes will turn out to be almost wholly ideological. Growing cultural and religious differences will be transformed from wars of words to battles soaked in blood. Long-simmering resentments could also degenerate quickly, spurring the basest of human instincts and triggering genocidal acts. Terrorists employing biological or nuclear weapons will vie with conventional forces using jets, cruise missiles, and bunker-busting bombs to cause widespread destruction. Many will interpret stepped-up conflicts between Muslims and Western societies as the beginnings of a new world war.<br />
Protectionism will force Obama to bash NAFTA<br />
O’Brien 08 (Dan, Senior Editor – Economic Intelligence Unit, “Our Vested Interest in a McCain Win”, Sunday Business Post, 11-2, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.sbpost.ie/post/pages/p/story.aspx-qqqt=GUEST+WRITER-qqqs=commentandanalysis-qqqid=37213-qqqx=1.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.sbpost.ie/post/pages/p/story.aspx-qqqt=GUEST+WRITER-qqqs=commentandanalysis-qqqid=37213-qqqx=1.asp</a>)<br />
Anti-globalisation sentiment is widespread in the Democratic Party, which has traditionally been less supportive of economic openness than the Republicans. The Democratic-controlled Congress has opposed free trade agreements and, since 2007, has refused the extension of presidential powers to negotiate trade deals without having for itself line-by-line veto power. This is one of the reasons why the Doha round of multilateral trade talks continues to languish. As for Obama himself, he has not shied away from protectionist rhetoric during the campaign. But, in fairness, his bite is unlikely to match his bark. His economic advisers are mostly solid internationalists, and one of them, Austan Goolsbee, let slip earlier in the year that Obama would not act on his threats of economic nationalism if elected. How could these factors come together and play out in relation to Ireland? By far the greatest threat is a change to the US corporation tax code. Many voices are now calling for US companies to be taxed on worldwide earnings in their home country. If American companies located in Ireland were obliged to pay the US rate of 35 per cent, it would mean that, on top of the 12.5 per cent of their profits booked in Ireland, which go to the Department of Finance, an additional 22.5 per cent would go to the treasury in Washington DC. US companies, which directly and indirectly employ one in ten people at work in Ireland, operate here for many reasons, but tax is undoubtedly of key importance. Data on output per worker in the sectors in which US companies dominate show that Irish workers produce more (often far more) than their counterparts elsewhere. There can be little doubt that this is attributable far less to the heroic toiling of Irish workers and far more to transfer pricing, which, put simply, is a method of inter-jurisdictional tax avoidance. Obama has made noises about closing what many Americans consider to be a loophole. US businesses will lobby hard against this, arguing that it would put them at a competitive disadvantage. But as the US fiscal position weakens and as anti-business sentiment becomes shriller, making companies pay more tax in the US may be both necessary and popular. If the US revamped its tax regime along those lines, it would fundamentally change the way American companies view their international operations in general, and their Irish operations in particular. Companies already in Ireland would be more likely to divest, and attracting new ones would be far more difficult. Under a McCain presidency, the existing tax code would be safe, because he believes it is good for American companies and good for America. Reassuringly for Ireland, he even cited approvingly the country’s low corporation tax rate in a TV debate with Obama. On trade, the differences between the candidates are narrower. Philip Gordon, who was director for Europe at the national security council during the Clinton administration, is among the hot favourites to take responsibility for Europe at the state department under Obama. At a conference in Barcelona in June, he stressed Obama’s commitment to bilateral trade links with Europe, and the importance of the multilateral trading system centred around the World Trade Organisation. Pragmatic Republicans don’t doubt the Obama commitments to avoid roll-back on trade. At a think-in of policy wonks and journalists in Slovakia two weeks ago, John Hulsman of the German Council on Foreign Relations, a hard-headed and worldly Republican, stated that, while Obama would not push for trade liberalisation, he was unlikely to go in the opposite direction. But whether, against his better judgment, Obama will be able to resist moving in a protectionist direction is moot. Europeans rarely realise that their prime ministers are far more powerful domestically than American presidents are in the US. Where European parliaments have limited powers over the executive branch of government, the US Congress can make life impossible for presidents. In order to get anything done, Obama will have to horse-trade with Congress. If demands for protectionism in the US rise, Congress will pander and even inflame. Legislators could call the president on his campaign promises, such as the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Obama may not be able to resist.<br />
Renegotiation sends a broad signal of disengagement – undermines Israeli confidence in U.S. commitments<br />
Lawrence 08 (Robert, Professor of International Trade and Investment – Harvard Kennedy School of Government, “Much Ado About NAFTA”, The Guardian, 3-6, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.hks.harvard.edu/news-events/news/commentary/much-ado-about-nafta" rel="nofollow">http://www.hks.harvard.edu/news-events/news/commentary/much-ado-about-nafta</a>)<br />
What would be the consequences if Nafta were to be renegotiated? On the plus side, the recent passage of the US-Peru free trade agreement with bipartisan support makes it clear that including strong environmental and labour provisions can help mobilise Democratic political support for trade. Aside from the indignity of being pressured, Canada and Mexico would probably agree to the language with respect to labour and environment that the US would be able to demand without alienating the Republicans who are the mainstay of support for trade agreements. After all, because of opposition from states that are tough on trade unions, the US has ratified only two of the eight core conventions of the International Labour Organisation while Canada has ratified five conventions and Mexico six. And unlike the US, the other members of Nafta still participate in the Kyoto protocols on climate change. Moreover Nafta is popular in Mexico and Canada, and both countries might see new negotiations as a way to promote their ideas for deepening economic integration in North America. Mexico for example, would surely like an improved treatment for the movement of labour, while Canada would like to replace US anti-dumping provisions with anti-trust rules. Of course, no country should continue to adhere to agreements that are fundamentally broken, but the circumstances should be truly exceptional. But there's a big difference between including provisions in new agreements and trying to reopen old ones. The renegotiation proposals create uncertainty about US commitments to its existing trade agreements and raise the risk that the renegotiated agreements could be rejected. The full benefits from trade agreements are only realised when they are credible and provide a permanent and reliable set of rules of the game that private decision-makers can count on. If Nafta is renegotiated it will immediately call other US agreements into question. Why shouldn't the Central American agreement (Cafta) be reopened on similar grounds? What about the US-Israel agreement, which was negotiated so long ago that it doesn't have any labour or environmental provisions at all? The candidates may say they only want a &quot;time-out&quot; but they will end up with a rematch. Each renegotiated agreement will need congressional approval and each will be a battle. Hillary Clinton disliked Nafta when it was first signed, because it took attention away from healthcare reform. Would the next US administration really spend the political capital necessary to have these new (old) agreements ratified? George Bush began his disastrous unilateralist foreign policy when he withdrew from the Kyoto protocols. It would be truly unfortunate if the next administration emulates him by sending a message to the rest of the world that US trade agreements and negotiations are no longer dependable.<br />

Israel will lash out – extinction<br />
Beres 99 (Louis Renes, Professor – Princeton, “Israel, Palestine, and Nuclear War”, The Freeman, April, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.freeman.org/m_online/apr99/beres.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.freeman.org/m_online/apr99/beres.htm</a>)<br />
Alternatively, Israel, believing that substantial enemy attack -chemical, biological, conventional, or nuclear - is imminent, could decide to preempt. If, as we might expect, this preemption were entirely nonnuclear, it could still fail to prevent the anticipated attack against Israel. Here, Israeli nuclear weapons, having failed in their mission to support conventional preemption by deterring enemy retaliation, might also have to be used for purposes of nuclear warfighting. Israel has much to fear, more - perhaps - than any other state on the face of the earth. Threatened by a growing number of adversaries with ballistic missiles and with a corollary interest in nuclear warheads, Jerusalem knows that transformation of Judea/Samaria and Gaza into Palestine could provide its enemies with the means and the incentives to destroy the Jewish State once and for all. Deprived of essential &quot;strategic depth,&quot; Israel could become seriously vulnerable to total defeat. Anguished by a possible end to the Third Temple Commonwealth, the nation's leaders would begin to think seriously about nuclear weapons as a last resort (the so-called &quot;Samson Option&quot;). It follows that however disturbing and problematic Israel's control of what remains of Judea/Samaria may be for the Arabs and for Iran, and however costly recovery of already surrendered &quot;West Bank&quot; lands would be for the Jewish State, the emergence of Palestinian statehood should be viewed with altogether grave concern. Otherwise, Palestine, looking first very much like Lebanon, could wind up as Armageddon, a metamorphosis that would favor neither Israeli nor Palestinian.<br />

2. H-2B Workers Often Fill Spots that American Workers Are Not Likely to Take Claims that H-2B workers take U.S. jobs away from willing American workers ignore key realities: H-2B-eligible work is usually seasonal and sometimes involves unglamorous and strenuous labor.[150] For example, the seasonal nature of hospitality and tourism-based work in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, highlights the need for a temporary labor force that logically must come from foreign sources.[151] As South Carolina’s Hospitality Association president explained, As the areas of our state that attract the most tourists have low residential populations as compared to the size of the community during peak tourism season, there are not enough local residents, or people willing to drive some distance to fill the jobs needed to help grow the state’s No. 1 industry, let alone sustain it.[152] Similarly, the general manager of a resort near Marble Falls, Texas, pointed out, “â€˜We’re in a rural area . . . . We have a tough time finding workers out here. It would be pretty near impossible to run this business’ without the H-2Bs.”[153] Furthermore, the nature of the work often turns away American workers. One employer said that he “tried hiring [Americans] from felony release programs, talking with temp agencies, paying all kinds of salaries. (People literally show up one day, take a look, and say I’m not doing this.)”[154] Likewise, Harry Phillips, who owns Russell Hall Seafood in Maryland, said of his employees, “We have American people in the offices, we hire a lot of American people, but we can’t find American people to pick crabs.”[155] 3. Evidence Has Demonstrated When Employers Cannot Access H-2B Workers, They Are Inclined to Turn to Undocumented Workers Reports that some employers bring on undocumented workers when efforts to access H-2B workers fail highlights that illegal aliens ”not H-2B workers” are most detrimental to American workers, and highlights the importance of enacting Senator Mikulski’s cap exemption provision. The National Foundation for American Policy (“NFAP”) has reported that employers who are shut out of participating in the H-2B program tend to turn to undocumented workers to fill their labor needs.[156] NFAP emphasized that “[i]t would seem naive to think that denying U.S. employers access to H-2B visa holders will result in a massive increase in hiring native-born U.S. workers. In fact, it is likely that the absence of legal temporary workers will mean more illegal immigration.”[157] In response to criticism that H-2B workers harm American workers by artificially lowering wages, NFAP has indicated it is not H-2B workers who negatively impact earnings, but illegal workers: “Reliable data show that legal workers command higher salaries than those here illegally. In other words, preventing businesses from hiring H-2B workers will logically mean more competition for natives with illegal immigrants who possess less bargaining power and earn lower wages than H-2B workers.”[158] NFAP has pointed out that employers must pay H-2B workers prevailing wages for their position the same wages to which similarly employed American workers are entitled, whereas undocumented workers, obviously, have no such express protections.[159] Reports that employers likely turn to undocumented workers to meet labor needs when they cannot access the H-2B program underscore the danger of capping the number of annually available H-2B visas at an arbitrarily low figure. NFAP’s findings unambiguously show that many illegal immigrants have been found to hold jobs that are often occupied by H-2B visa holders, and because the “occupations are generally common to illegal immigrants, this . . . demonstrate[s] that blocking the entry of additional workers on H-2B visas is more likely to increase the use of unauthorized workers.”[160] In fact, under comprehensive immigration reform proposals considered in Congress in 2007 such as the new Y-visa program, the number of legal temporary workers permitted annually would have been increased significantly to approximately half a million.[161] The nearly ten-fold increase “would not be additions to the population; they would be the same migrants who are arriving today illegally. â€˜It sounds like a large number, but that’s because we’d be counting them instead of pretending that they’re not here,’” Deborah Meyers, a senior analyst with the Migration Policy Institute, told the San Francisco Chronicle.[162] In the absence of any comprehensive panacea to the H-2B program, however, Senator Mikulski’s proposed cap exemption serves as a suitable palliative. As NFAP’s findings have demonstrated, setting the number of available H-2B visas too low encourages employers to circumvent the system. As recent years have demonstrated, each fiscal year employers immediately snap up the 66,000 available H-2B visas, leaving many other employers who have been certified by DOL as eligible to host H-2B workers with no opportunity to access the program.[163] For instance, because Senator Mikulski’s returning worker cap exemption has not yet been re-approved, USCIS announced on January 3, 2008, that all visas for the period from April to October 2008 were taken.[164] In years where the exemption was in effect, however, more employers were able to access the program. For the period from April to October 2006, USCIS accepted visa applications until April 4, 2006;[165] from April to October 2007, USCIS accepted visa applications until March 16, 2007.[166] Therefore, with some employers’ needs covered under the exemption for returning workers, the H-2B program was able to support additional employers, almost certainly helping to alleviate some of their labor needs, and thereby preventing them from turning to alternative potentially illegal sources of available labor to keep their businesses afloat. Yet, because Congress has failed to renew Senator Mikulski’s cap exemption provision for FY 2008, once again countless employers have been shut out from the H-2B program because their labor needs are still more than four months away. Many such businesses cannot survive without the foreign laborers upon whom they have become dependent, and those that can survive face certain losses. Denied congressional assistance via Senator Mikulski’s provision, and backed into a corner with seemingly no other options, it seems certain that at least some employers’ survival instincts will lead them to consider using undocumented workers.<br />
Plan solves the entitlement crisis and key components of the economy – Consensus of studies<br />
IPC ‘11 (Immigration Policy Center, Jan 20, “Immigration Reform and Job Growth”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.immigrationpolicy.org/just-facts/immigration-reform-and-job-growth" rel="nofollow">http://www.immigrationpolicy.org/just-facts/immigration-reform-and-job-growth</a>),<br />
Legalizing Unauthorized Immigrants Would Boost the U.S. Economy With the U.S. unemployment rate hovering at 10%, some have questioned whether or not now is really the right time for comprehensive immigration reform that includes the creation of a pathway to legal status for unauthorized immigrants already living in the United States. Underlying this uncertainty is the fear that native-born Americans will lose out on scarce jobs if currently unauthorized immigrants acquire legal status—despite the obvious fact that unauthorized immigrants are already here and in the labor force. However, the best available evidence suggests that neither legal nor unauthorized immigration is the cause of high unemployment, and that the higher wages and purchasing power which formerly unauthorized immigrants would enjoy were they to receive legal status would sustain new jobs. Immigrants are not the cause of high U.S. unemployment. Immigration is not associated with high unemployment at the regional, state, or county levels. * If immigrants really “took” jobs away from large numbers of native-born workers, especially during economic hard times, then one would expect to find high unemployment rates in those parts of the country with the largest numbers of immigrants—especially immigrants who have come to the United States recently (many of whom are unauthorized) and, presumably, are more willing to work for lower wages and under worse conditions than either long-term immigrants or native-born workers. Yet a series of reports in 2009 by Rob Paral &amp; Associates for the Immigration Policy Center found that there is little apparent relationship between recent immigration and unemployment rates at the regional, state, or county level. * On average, recent immigrants comprise 3.1% of the population in counties with the highest unemployment rates (over 13.4%). But recent immigrants account for a higher share of the population (4.6%) in counties with the lowest unemployment rates (below 4.8%). * The highest unemployment rates are found in counties located in manufacturing centers and rural areas—which tend to have relatively few recent immigrants. Recent immigrants usually go where the jobs are: metropolitan and non-manufacturing counties where unemployment rates are lower. Immigration is not associated with high unemployment among minorities. * A January 2011 report by Harry J. Holzer found that the welfare of less-skilled minorities would not be substantially improved by the absence of immigration. Without immigration, less-skilled workers would also be forced to pay higher prices for food, medical care, and housing. * Rob Paral &amp; Associates found that the 10 metropolitan areas with the highest shares of recent immigrants in the labor force, the unemployment rate for native-born blacks is about 1.5 percentage points less than in the 10 metropolitan areas with the lowest share of recent immigrants. * Recent immigrants are 17% of the labor force in Miami, but only 3% of the labor force in Cleveland. Yet the unemployment rate for native-born blacks in Cleveland is double that of native-born blacks in Miami. Immigrant and native-born workers are not interchangeable. * Rob Paral &amp; Associates found that nearly one-third (30.6%) of all employed recent immigrants had a bachelor’s degree or more education in 2008 and were unlikely to be in the same job markets as unemployed natives, of whom only 14.1% had a bachelor’s degree or more education. * Over one-quarter (27.4%) of all unemployed natives had some college short of a bachelor’s degree in 2008 and were unlikely to be in the same job markets as employed recent immigrants, of whom only 14.4% had some college short of a bachelor’s degree. * Even among workers without a high-school diploma, unemployed natives and employed recent immigrants differ in location, occupation, and work experience. The 1986 legalization demonstrated that legalized workers earn more, spend more, and pay more in taxes. * Studies have found that immigrants who received legal status under the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) acquired more education, earned higher wages, moved out of poverty, bought homes, and generally invested in themselves and their communities. For example, a November 2009 study by Rob Paral &amp; Associates for the Immigration Policy Center found that while 34% of IRCA immigrants age 35-44 years owned homes in 1990, 68% owned homes in 2006. * Legal status lets workers parlay greater education and mastery of English into higher pay. The wage gains experienced by workers legalized under IRCA resulted in large part from the fact that legal status allows workers with more education or proficiency in English to earn higher wages, according to research by economists at the University of Michigan and Australian National University. For instance, if the immigrant men who received legal status under IRCA had been “legal” throughout their entire working lives in the United States, their wages by 1992 would have been 24% higher because they would have been paid in relation to their actual skills, and would have been motivated to improve their skills to increase their earning power. * Legal status allows workers to move into higher-paid occupations. Many workers legalized under IRCA were able to move into entirely new occupations that pay higher average wages than the occupations in which they previously worked, according to various studies. For instance, a survey of Mexican men legalized under IRCA found that 38.8% had moved up into higher-paying occupations by 1992. Comprehensive immigration reform that includes legalization of currently unauthorized immigrants would support U.S. jobs. * A January 2010 study by Dr. Raúl Hinojosa-Ojeda, conducted for the Immigration Policy Center and the Center for American Progress, estimates that immigration reform which includes legalization of unauthorized immigrants and the creation of more flexible channels for legal immigration in the future would add at least $1.5 trillion in cumulative U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) over 10 years. * Over the first three years, higher personal income would generate increased consumer spending—enough to support 750,000–900,000 jobs in the United States—as well as increased tax revenues of $4.5-$5.4 billion. * The benefits of additional growth in the gross domestic product would be spread broadly throughout the U.S. economy, but immigrant-heavy sectors such as textiles, electronic equipment, and construction would see particularly large increases. * A January 2010 study from the University of Southern California estimates that “unauthorized Latino immigrants in California…missed out on approximately $2.2 billion in wages and salary income last year alone due solely to their legal status, and the state lost out on the multiplied impacts of that potential income and spending, suggesting a total potential gain of $3.25 billion annually from authorization.” * Because unauthorized immigrants earn less than they would if they had legal status, the California state government lost out on $310 million in income taxes in 2009, while the federal government missed out on $1.4 billion. * Moreover, “gains from increased levels of educational attainment…and English fluency would result in an additional $8.6 billion in wage income. The multiplied impact of this on the California economy in direct and indirect spending would be about $12.7 billion. Combined with the immediate effects, this is a $16 billion boost to California.” * A February 2010 report from the Economic Policy Institute (EPI) finds that the “effect of immigration from 1994 to 2007 was to raise the wages of U.S.-born workers, relative to foreign-born workers, by 0.4% (or $3.68 per week).” Even the small (and shrinking) number of “U.S.-born workers with less than a high school education saw a relative 0.3% increase in wages (or $1.58 per week)” as a result of immigration during this period. * The report emphasizes that “more people, including more foreigners, do not mean lower wages or higher unemployment. If they did, every time a baby was born or a new graduate entered the labor force, they would hurt existing workers. But new workers do not just have supply-side impacts, they also affect demand. Those new graduates buy food and cars and pay rent. In other words, while new workers add to the supply of labor, they also consume goods and services, creating more jobs. An economy with more people does not mean lower wages and higher unemployment, it is simply a bigger economy. Just because New York is bigger than Los Angeles does not in and of itself mean workers in New York are worse off than workers in Los Angeles.” * An August 2009 report by the libertarian CATO Institute found that comprehensive reform would increase U.S. GDP by $180 billion in 2019. * The 2006 immigration reform bill, which included a legalization program, would have more than paid for its reform provisions through increased tax revenue. The Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that, as originally introduced on April 7, 2006, the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006 would have generated $66 billion in new revenue during 2007-2016 from income and payroll taxes, as well as various administrative fees. * This additional revenue would have more than offset the $54 billion in new “direct spending” during 2007-2016 for refundable tax credits, Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security, and food stamps for newly eligible immigrants and their families. The alternative to comprehensive reform—deportation—would be expensive and damaging to the U.S. economy. * A policy designed to deport approximately 10 million unauthorized immigrants would cost at least $206 billion over five years, or $41.2 billion annually, according to a study by the Center for American Progress. * Deporting millions of unauthorized workers and consumers would damage the U.S. economy. The Perryman Group estimated that the long-term negative effect of eliminating the unauthorized workforce would include roughly $245 billion in lost GDP and 2.8 million lost jobs.<br />
Plan restores the worker per retiree ratio, which is key to save Social Security and Medicare<br />
Reich ‘10 (Robert, Professor of Public Policy at the University of California at Berkeley. He has served in three national administrations, most recently as secretary of labor under President Bill Clinton, April 11, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.csmonitor.com/Business/Robert--s-Blog/2010/0411/Immigration-Could-it-solve-Social-Security-Medicare-woes" rel="nofollow">http://www.csmonitor.com/Business/Robert--s-Blog/2010/0411/Immigration-Could-it-solve-Social-Security-Medicare-woes</a>)<br />
Sixty years later, we boomers have a lot to be worried about because most of us plan to retire in a few years and Social Security and Medicare are on the way to going bust. I should know because I used to be a trustee of the Social Security and Medicare trust funds. Those of you who are younger than we early boomers have even more to be worried about because if those funds go bust they won’t be there when you’re ready to retire. It’s already starting to happen. This year Social Security will pay out more in benefits than it receives in payroll taxes. The tipping point came sooner than anyone expected because the recession has kicked so many people off payrolls. But it was coming anyway. And it adds new urgency to reforming Social Security — a task the president’s commission on the nation’s debt is focusing on. So what’s the answer? Fed Chair Ben Bernanke this week listed the choices. “To avoid large and unsustainable budget deficits,” he said in a speech on Wednesday, “the nation must choose among higher taxes, modifications to entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare, less spending on everything else from education to defense, or some combination of the above.” Bernanke is almost certainly right about “some combination,” but he leaves out one other possible remedy that should be included in that combination: Immigration. You see, the biggest reason Social Security is in trouble, and Medicare as well, is because America is aging so fast. It’s not just that so many boomers are retiring. It’s also that seniors are living longer. And families are having fewer children. Add it all up and the number of people who are working relative to the number who are retired keeps shrinking. Forty years ago there were five workers for every retiree. Now there are three. Within a couple of decades, there will be only two workers per retiree. There’s no way just two workers will be able or willing to pay enough payroll taxes to keep benefits flowing to every retiree. This is where immigration comes in. Most immigrants are young because the impoverished countries they come from are demographically the opposite of rich countries. Rather than aging populations, their populations are bursting with young people. Yes, I know: There aren’t enough jobs right now even for Americans who want and need them. But once the American economy recovers, there will be. Take a long-term view and most new immigrants to the U.S. will be working for many decades. Get it? One logical way to deal with the crisis of funding Social Security and Medicare is to have more workers per retiree, and the simplest way to do that is to allow more immigrants into the United States. Immigration reform and entitlement reform have a lot to do with one another.<br />
The plan would boost spending power and decrease wasteful spending on enforcement, which restores tax revenue<br />
IPC ‘10 (Immigration Policy Center, April 13th, “ THE FISCAL BOTTOM LINE ON IMMIGRATION REFORM: The Costs of Enforcement-Only and the Benefits of Comprehensive Reform” American Immigration Council)<br />
We spend huge sums of taxpayer money on immigration enforcement… • Since Fiscal Year (FY) 2004, the budgets of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)—the border-enforcement and interior-enforcement components of Department of Homeland Security (DHS)—have increased dramatically. CBP’s budget grew from $6 billion in FY 2004 to $11.4 billion in FY 2010, while ICE’s budget increased from $3.7 billion to $5.7 billion over the same period.1 • Since FY 2005, Congress has allocated $2.4 billion to build fences along the southwest border—and another $1.1 billion to build a high-tech network of cameras and sensors known as “SBInet.” However, there is no evidence that the fences actually deter unauthorized immigrants, and SBInet has been plagued by technical glitches, shoddy testing, and missed deadlines since its inception.2 On March 16, 2010, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano froze SBInet funding, pending the outcome of a comprehensive review of the program.3 • Based on figures from the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers, a fence along all 2,000 miles of the southwest border would cost at least $2.5 billion to build, plus anywhere from $33 billion to $140 billion to maintain over the following two-and-a-half decades, depending upon how many breaches the fencing sustains which must be repaired.4…yet unauthorized immigrants have not been deterred from coming to the United States when there are jobs available. • A research team led by Wayne Cornelius, Director of the Center for Comparative Immigration Studies at the University of California, San Diego, has found that while unauthorized migrants from Mexico may be caught on their first attempt at crossing the border, they have an almost 100 percent chance of eventual success—particularly if they enlist the services of a coyote, or people smuggler.5 Moreover, as border enforcement is tightened between ports of entry along the southwest border, more migrants are being smuggled through ports of entry (sealed in a compartment within a vehicle, or as a passenger with false or borrowed documents).6 • Research by Cornelius and his team have also found that undocumented migration from Mexico has diminished mainly because there are fewer jobs available in the United States.7 Legalizing unauthorized immigrants would increase tax revenue. • A January 2010 study by Dr. Raúl Hinojosa-Ojeda, conducted for the Immigration Policy Center and the Center for American Progress, estimates that during the first three years after legalization, the higher earning power of newly legalized workers “would generate $4.5 to $5.4 billion in additional net tax revenue.”8 • A January 2010 study from the University of Southern California estimates that because unauthorized immigrants earn less than they would if they had legal status, the California state government lost out on $310 million in income taxes in 2009, while the federal government missed out on $1.4 billion.9 The alternative to legalization—deportation—would be a monumental waste of taxpayer dollars. A March 2010 study by the Center for American Progress “calculates a price tag of $200 billion to enforce a federal dragnet that would snare the estimated 10.8 million undocumented immigrants in the United States over five years.”10<br />
Immigrants key to entitlement crisis - they lead to net positive contribution<br />
Myers 8 (Dowell, PhD, professor and demographer, “Old Promises and New Blood: How Immigration Reform Can Help America Prosper in the Face of Baby Boomer Retirement”, The Reform Institute, Nov 24)<br />
Immigrant contributions to a more balanced senior ratio are vital for addressing the first peril of an aging society, namely the nation’s growing entitlements burden and the fiscal crisis. A greater proportion of working age residents supports fiscal stability because of the tax contributions made by immigrants. A series of recent studies have shown that, for example, ―… most immigrants pay the same taxes as native- born New Yorkers.‖26 Whether they occupy owned or rented homes, all residents pay property taxes, either directly or through a landlord. All residents also pay sales taxes and other taxes or fees on goods consumed (such as gasoline taxes). And even undocumented immigrants pay payroll taxes withheld by employers for Social Security and Medicare even though they will not qualify for those benefits themselves.27 Whether immigrants pay more in taxes than they receive in benefits is a more challenging question to answer. A key decision is whether to include the native-born children of immigrants in this calculation. All children are very expensive because of the high costs of education, by far the largest component of state and local government expenditures.28 Of course, over the longer run those education expenditures amount to investments in growing the next generation of workers and taxpayers, so a short- run calculation of costs and benefits does not provide the best perspective. Also, immigrants tend to be more expensive when newly arrived and return greater benefits later. Therefore, we need to cost out the fiscal impacts over the life cycle of both immigrants and their children. The authoritative study conducted in 1997 by the National Research Council (NRC) reported detailed simulations over three generations.29 That study reported substantial lifetime contributions by immigrants, net of services received and even more by their children. The NRC study found that the impacts of immigration depend not only on the relative numbers of immigrants but also on their age at arrival, whether that is before or after the expense of schooling, in the high taxpaying middle age period, or in retirement years. Also, the impacts are considerably less positive for immigrants with less than a high school education and are more positive for those with education beyond high school. Added to the difficulty of assessing impacts over time, there is the question of a spatial mismatch between taxes and services at different levels of government. It is widely recognized that more of the fiscal benefits of immigration go to the federal level (through payroll taxes), while more of the service costs fall to the state and local governments (primarily through spending on education and health). Thus, immigrants and their children can truly assist with bearing the weight of the entitlements crisis felt by the federal government. However, localities with large immigrant populations or new destinations for immigrant settlement may suffer a fiscal shock to their local budgets. In response, what would be desirable is a way to share more of the federal fiscal benefits of immigration with those localities. Similarly, we need to find a way to share more of the long- term benefits with the places where initial costs of investment are being borne. Overall, immigration may make good fiscal sense, but there are local wrinkles needing to be ironed out.<br />

Low skilled immigration promotes growth and prevents offshoring – the newest study prove<br />
Cowen ‘10 (Tyler, is a professor of economics at George Mason University, October 30, “How Immigrants Create More Jobs”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/31/business/economy/31view.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/31/business/economy/31view.html</a>).<br />
Over all, it turns out that the continuing arrival of immigrants to American shores is encouraging business activity here, thereby producing more jobs, according to a new study. Its authors argue that the easier it is to find cheap immigrant labor at home, the less likely that production will relocate offshore. The study, “Immigration, Offshoring and American Jobs,” was written by two economics professors — Gianmarco I. P. Ottaviano of Bocconi University in Italy and Giovanni Peri of the University of California, Davis — along with Greg C. Wright, a Ph.D. candidate at Davis. The study notes that when companies move production offshore, they pull away not only low-wage jobs but also many related jobs, which can include high-skilled managers, tech repairmen and others. But hiring immigrants even for low-wage jobs helps keep many kinds of jobs in the United States, the authors say. In fact, when immigration is rising as a share of employment in an economic sector, offshoring tends to be falling, and vice versa, the study found. In other words, immigrants may be competing more with offshored workers than with other laborers in America. American economic sectors with much exposure to immigration fared better in employment growth than more insulated sectors, even for low-skilled labor, the authors found. It’s hard to prove cause and effect in these studies, or to measure all relevant variables precisely, but at the very least, the evidence in this study doesn’t offer much support for the popular bias against immigration, and globalization more generally. We see the job-creating benefits of trade and immigration every day, even if we don’t always recognize them. As other papers by Professor Peri have shown, low-skilled immigrants usually fill gaps in American labor markets and generally enhance domestic business prospects rather than destroy jobs; this occurs because of an important phenomenon, the presence of what are known as “complementary” workers, namely those who add value to the work of others. An immigrant will often take a job as a construction worker, a drywall installer or a taxi driver, for example, while a native-born worker may end up being promoted to supervisor. And as immigrants succeed here, they help the United States develop strong business and social networks with the rest of the world, making it easier for us to do business with India, Brazil and most other countries, again creating more jobs. For all the talk of the dangers of offshoring, there is a related trend that we might call in-shoring. Dell or Apple computers may be assembled overseas, for example, but those products aid many American businesses at home and allow them to expand here. A cheap call center in India can encourage a company to open up more branches to sell its products in the United States. Those are further examples of how some laborers can complement others; it’s not all about one group of people taking jobs from another. Job creation and destruction are so intertwined that, over all, the authors find no statistically verifiable connection between offshoring and net creation of American jobs. We’re all worried about unemployment, but the problem is usually rooted in macroeconomic conditions, not in immigration or offshoring. (According to a Pew study, the number of illegal immigrants from the Caribbean and Latin America fell 22 percent from 2007 to 2009; their departure has not had much effect on the weak United States job market.) Remember, too, that each immigrant consumes products sold here, therefore also helping to create jobs. When it comes to immigration, positive-sum thinking is too often absent in public discourse these days. Debates on immigration and labor markets reflect some common human cognitive failings — namely, that we are quicker to vilify groups of different “others” than we are to blame impersonal forces. Consider the fears that foreign competition, offshoring and immigration have destroyed large numbers of American jobs. In reality, more workers have probably been displaced by machines — as happens every time computer software eliminates a task formerly performed by a clerical worker. Yet we know that machines and computers do the economy far more good than harm and that they create more jobs than they destroy.<br />

<span class="Underline">“The US has run out of bullets,” said Nouriel Roubini, professor at New York University, and one of a caste of luminaries with grim forecasts at the annual Ambrosetti conference on Lake Como. “More quantitative easing (bond purchases) by the Federal Reserve is not going to make any difference. Treasury yields are already down to 2.5pc yet credit spreads are widening again. Monetary policy can boost liquidity but it can’t deal with solvency problems,” he told Europe’s policy elite. Dr Roubini said the US growth rate was likely to fall below 1pc in the second half of the year, despite the biggest stimulus in history: a cut in interest rates from 5pc to zero, a budget deficit of 10pc of GDP, and $3 trillion to shore up the financial system. The anaemic pace compares with rates of 4pc-6pc at this stage of recovery in normal post-war recoveries. “We have reached stall speed. Any shock at this point can tip you back into recession. With interbank spreads rising, you can get a vicious circle like 2008-2009,” he said, describing a self-feeding process as the real economy and the credit system hurt each other. “There is a 40pc chance of double-dip recession in the US, and worse in Japan. Even if it is not technically a recession it will feel like it,” he added. Hans-Werner Sinn, head of Germany’s IFO Institute, said the US would have to purge its debt excesses the hard way. “The bitter truth is that there is no way out of this with monetary and fiscal policy. They will just have to see their living standards go down. I see a decade of difficulties for the US,” he said.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">Double-dip recession now and will lead to high unemployment - </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Elwell 12/28/10 (Craig, Specialist in Macroeconomic Policy , December 28, “Double-Dip Recession: Previous Experience and Current Prospect”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://economic-legislation.blogspot.com/2010/12/double-dip-recession-previous.html" rel="nofollow">http://economic-legislation.blogspot.com/2010/12/double-dip-recession-previous.html</a>)</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Concerns have been expressed that the United States may be about to experience a “double-dip” recession. A double-dip or W-shaped recession occurs when the economy emerges from a recession, has a short period of growth, but then falls back into recession. This prospect raises policy questions about the current level of economic stimulus and whether added stimulus may be needed. The pace of the recovery has been below average and is decelerating, falling from a 5% to a 1.7% annual average rate of growth between the fourth quarter of 2009 and the second quarter of 2010. Other indicators, such as high unemployment, falling house prices, reduced flows of credit, and the prospect of fading fiscal stimulus, are also worrisome. Double-dip recessions are rare. There are only two modern examples of a double-dip recession for the United States: the recession of 1937-1938 and the recession of 1981-1982. They both had the common attribute of resulting from a change in economic policy. In the first case, recession was an unintended consequence of the policy change; in the second case, recession was an intended consequence. Historically, there has been what is termed a “snap back” relationship between the severity of the recession and the strength of the subsequent recovery. In other words, a sharp contraction followed by a robust recovery traces out a V-shaped pattern of growth. However, unlike earlier post-war recessions, the recent recession occurred with a financial crisis. Research suggests that a slow recovery with sustained high unemployment is the norm in the aftermath of a deep financial crisis.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">GMJ: Six to eight months ago, many economists were saying the economy would reach its nadir in summer 2009, then it would start to grow again -- or at least stop contracting so fast. Do you think that's likely? Dr. Jacobe: It's a matter of perspective. I think most economists were saying that the second half is when we'd start to see a recovery. Then things got worse, so that got modified. Now, most economists think the economy will bottom out in the second half of 2009 and begin recovery in 2010. I think given the current situation, that is the most likely scenario. But there are several reasons for concern. First, the current economic downturn started as a financial crisis led to a crisis for the overall economy. Although the financial situation seems to be improving, I'm still concerned about the flow of credit to consumers and small businesses. The evaporation of the so-called shadow banking system of securitization, increased bank capital requirements, a return to old-time underwriting standards, and increased credit losses in such sectors as commercial real estate and credit cards all suggest reduced credit availability compared to anything experienced during the past several years. Second, we are in a period of business uncertainty unparalleled since the 1930s. Business owners and managers simply have little or no &quot;visibility&quot; going forward. Consumers have changed their spending habits and businesses have stopped investing. Further, there appears to be a level of &quot;government risk&quot; that is unprecedented in the post WWII period. This may be the right time -- even a golden opportunity -- for achieving &quot;change&quot; in many major business sectors politically, but the resulting increased uncertainty could &quot;metastasize&quot; the current recession. Third, now we're in a more traditional recession. As more businesses disappear and unemployment goes up even more, there could be another pullback in spending by consumers and businesses. As you can tell, right now I'm really worried about consumer spending. In this regard, most people think of the job market as a lagging indicator, but I think employment is the key to rebuilding the consumer psychology that allows consumers to spend comfortably and on big-ticket items. I think people need to feel more secure about their jobs -- and they need to feel more secure about their personal balance sheets -- before we'll see a real upswing in the general economy. What we really need to see is more stability in the job market, more job creation, and a real increase in consumer spending before we'll get any real recovery.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">The Professional Landcare Network (PLANET) recently released figures showing the dramatic economic impact that could result if Congress does not act quickly regarding the H-2B crisis. Senators Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.) and John Warner (R-Va.) have tried once again this year to extend the returning worker provision under the H-2B visa program for five years. The $43 billion landscape industry is one of many in the United States that depends on seasonal workers to survive. Companies throughout these industries face chronic shortages of temporary seasonal workers that Congress partially relieved through the H-2B program's returning worker exemption. Unfortunately, this provision, which rewards those companies and individuals who follow the law, expired on September 30 despite widespread bipartisan support for its extension. The program proposes exempting returning seasonal workers from counting against the national cap of 66,000 people. A cap exemption was added three years ago, but the clause expired on September 30, a day before the new fiscal year. The cap exemption is typically met within the first months of the fiscal year. In the past, the cap has been met by January, leaving many lawn and landscape businesses without the workers they need for their crucial spring season. There are stringent rules on advertising these jobs to Americans, and companies must work diligently to try to fill these positions with American workers before they are opened up to guest workers. It is estimated that 2.5 American jobs are tied to each H-2B seasonal worker. &quot;It's not just companies in our industry and the communities they serve who are suffering,&quot; said Tom Delaney, PLANET's director of government affairs. &quot;The H-2B disaster also puts at risk the welfare of American workers and their families. And, as significantly, Congress' failure to act is placing in jeopardy American jobs at truck assembly and equipment manufacturing plants, not to mention other companies that support and supply our industry.&quot;</span><br />

<span class="Underline">Yet that is exactly the effect of an immigration policy that fails to recognize and meet our need for unskilled foreign labor. Mr. Camarota could not be more wrong about immigration's consequences for the economy. In fact, rather than taking jobs from Americans, immigrants grow the pie for everyone: attracting investment, making capital more productive, and filling jobs at the low end of the ladder so that increasingly educated Americans can maximize their productivity. Newcomers don't generally compete with the native-born, they complement them, to everyone's benefit. Even the 9 percent of American workers who haven't completed high school—the only ones who go head-to-head with immigrants and whose wages sometimes suffer as a result, though by no more than a few percentage points over the past twenty years—make up what they lose in wages in cheaper services. Meanwhile, immigrant entrepreneurs create jobs, and immigration allows many industries, including agriculture and food processing, to stay in the United States rather than move where labor is cheaper. Yes, many immigrants are poor, uneducated workers who pay relatively little in taxes. But that's precisely the point: even with modern technology—in some cases, because of it—we still need a significant number of low-skilled workers to keep our economy running. Surely Mr. Camarota isn't suggesting that we do the right thing when we profit from their labor but, by keeping them illegal, limit their access to services? And if anything, once they became legal residents, they would pay more of their fair share of the taxes that pay for those benefits.</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Low skilled immigration promotes growth and prevents offshoring – the newest study prove</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Cowen 10/31/10 (Tyler, is a professor of economics at George Mason University, October 30, “How Immigrants Create More Jobs”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/31/business/economy/31view.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/31/business/economy/31view.html</a>).</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Over all, it turns out that the continuing arrival of immigrants to American shores is encouraging business activity here, thereby producing more jobs, according to a new study. Its authors argue that the easier it is to find cheap immigrant labor at home, the less likely that production will relocate offshore. The study, “Immigration, Offshoring and American Jobs,” was written by two economics professors — Gianmarco I. P. Ottaviano of Bocconi University in Italy and Giovanni Peri of the University of California, Davis — along with Greg C. Wright, a Ph.D. candidate at Davis. The study notes that when companies move production offshore, they pull away not only low-wage jobs but also many related jobs, which can include high-skilled managers, tech repairmen and others. But hiring immigrants even for low-wage jobs helps keep many kinds of jobs in the United States, the authors say. In fact, when immigration is rising as a share of employment in an economic sector, offshoring tends to be falling, and vice versa, the study found. In other words, immigrants may be competing more with offshored workers than with other laborers in America. American economic sectors with much exposure to immigration fared better in employment growth than more insulated sectors, even for low-skilled labor, the authors found. It’s hard to prove cause and effect in these studies, or to measure all relevant variables precisely, but at the very least, the evidence in this study doesn’t offer much support for the popular bias against immigration, and globalization more generally. We see the job-creating benefits of trade and immigration every day, even if we don’t always recognize them. As other papers by Professor Peri have shown, low-skilled immigrants usually fill gaps in American labor markets and generally enhance domestic business prospects rather than destroy jobs; this occurs because of an important phenomenon, the presence of what are known as “complementary” workers, namely those who add value to the work of others. An immigrant will often take a job as a construction worker, a drywall installer or a taxi driver, for example, while a native-born worker may end up being promoted to supervisor. And as immigrants succeed here, they help the United States develop strong business and social networks with the rest of the world, making it easier for us to do business with India, Brazil and most other countries, again creating more jobs. For all the talk of the dangers of offshoring, there is a related trend that we might call in-shoring. Dell or Apple computers may be assembled overseas, for example, but those products aid many American businesses at home and allow them to expand here. A cheap call center in India can encourage a company to open up more branches to sell its products in the United States. Those are further examples of how some laborers can complement others; it’s not all about one group of people taking jobs from another. Job creation and destruction are so intertwined that, over all, the authors find no statistically verifiable connection between offshoring and net creation of American jobs. We’re all worried about unemployment, but the problem is usually rooted in macroeconomic conditions, not in immigration or offshoring. (According to a Pew study, the number of illegal immigrants from the Caribbean and Latin America fell 22 percent from 2007 to 2009; their departure has not had much effect on the weak United States job market.) Remember, too, that each immigrant consumes products sold here, therefore also helping to create jobs. When it comes to immigration, positive-sum thinking is too often absent in public discourse these days. Debates on immigration and labor markets reflect some common human cognitive failings — namely, that we are quicker to vilify groups of different “others” than we are to blame impersonal forces. Consider the fears that foreign competition, offshoring and immigration have destroyed large numbers of American jobs. In reality, more workers have probably been displaced by machines — as happens every time computer software eliminates a task formerly performed by a clerical worker. Yet we know that machines and computers do the economy far more good than harm and that they create more jobs than they destroy.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">Finally, you also became aware of the following facts: Federal government expenditures are growing far faster than the economy, and thus the government is becoming a larger and larger share of gross domestic product. Obviously, this cannot continue forever because eventually the government would totally drive out the private sector. The entitlement programs (i.e., Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, etc.) all continue to grow faster than the economy, and they will take more than 100 percent of all federal tax revenue this year, requiring that virtually all of the other government spending programs, including defense and interest payments on the debt, be funded by more borrowing. You are also aware that the government cannot tax its way out of the deficit situation, because increasing income tax rates on the upper income people will both slow the economy and cause them to find legal or illegal ways to avoid the tax increase, and the politicians have pledged to not increase taxes on those making less than $250,000, which includes all but a very few Americans. Even if the politicians break their pledges not to increase taxes, they still cannot solve the deficit problem as long as they refuse to cut back on the growth in Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid — because any new tax revenue will be quickly absorbed by the growth in spending. The best that any tax increase could do is delay the explosion of the debt bomb by, perhaps, a couple of years while further weakening the economy and job growth. Now suppose you are not an individual bondholder but the Chinese government official responsible for the Chinese economy, and you know your government holds about $1 trillion in U.S. government securities. You have watched Congress and the administration become less and less fiscally responsible — more spending, more taxes, and more debt. Then suddenly the administration puts punitive tariffs on your tire manufacturers while at the same time refuses to approve the trade treaties with Colombia, Panama and South Korea that have been negotiated. You understand that these foolish and destructive actions by U.S. government officials indicate it does not understand the importance of free trade in fostering economic growth, and seem to be intent on replicating the mistakes of the 1930s. The Chinese are not stupid, and they have been vocal in saying they are concerned that U.S. policies will lead to a further fall in the dollar and higher rates of inflation, both of which undermine the value of their investment in U.S. government securities. The Chinese are now trying to diversify their holdings — and their recent activity in buying large quantities of tradable commodities is probably, in part, a hedge against a falling U.S. dollar. Thus, at the same time, the U.S. government needs to sell trillions of dollars of new bonds. It is by its own actions driving away foreign purchasers of bonds, which can only result in higher interest rates in the United States, which will further slow economic growth. What is particularly frightening is that neither political party has offered a serious plan to defuse the debt bomb. The Democrats are just piling up more debt as if there were no limit, and the Republicans, to date, are only proposing measures to reduce the increase, rather than reverse it. When the debt bomb explodes — within the next one to three years — expect to see record high real interest rates and/or inflation, coupled with a collapse of many &quot;entitlements.&quot; It will be like the neutron bomb, the buildings will be left standing, but the people will not. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke warned today of a &quot;fiscal crisis&quot; in coming years if the government does not act soon to curb federal retirement and health care entitlement programs, picking up a theme that his predecessor, Alan Greenspan, had pursued without success at the end of his term as head of the central bank. In prepared remarks delivered this morning to the Senate Budget Committee, Bernanke said that a dip this year in the annual federal budget deficit to $248 billion was &quot;the calm before the storm,&quot; with ballooning entitlement payments looming over the next 20 years as the Baby Boomers retire and medical costs skyrocket. By 2030, he said, spending under current law on Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid could consume as much as 15 percent of the nation's economic output, double the current rate. Underwriting that could lead to a &quot;vicious cycle,&quot; he said, as the nation borrows more to meet its obligations and spends increasing amounts to service that debt, leaving less for investors and consumers and slowing economic growth. &quot;If early and meaningful action is not taken, the U.S. economy could be seriously weakened with future generations bearing much of the cost&quot;... (Full piece here.) While dire warnings like these may seem alarmist, few people realize how conventional these frightening scenarios of the long-term budget picture have become in Washington policy circles. A famous example comes from the otherwise-staid Congressional Budget Office, who uses colorful language such as economic &quot;collapse&quot; to describe the possible impact of growing entitlement spending on the U.S. economy: Taken to the extreme, such a path [of borrowing to cover growing entitlement spending] could result in an economic crisis. Foreign investors could reduce their purchases of U.S. securities, the exchange value of the dollar could plunge, interest rates could climb, consumer prices could shoot up, or the economy could contract sharply. Amid the anticipation of declining profits and rising inflation and interest rates, stock markets could collapse and consumers might sharply reduce their consumption. Moreover, economic problems in the United States could spill over to the rest of the world and seriously weaken the economies of U.S. trading partners. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Plan restores the worker per retiree ratio, which is key to save Social Security and Medicare</span><br />

<span class="Underline">Sixty years later, we boomers have a lot to be worried about because most of us plan to retire in a few years and Social Security and Medicare are on the way to going bust. I should know because I used to be a trustee of the Social Security and Medicare trust funds. Those of you who are younger than we early boomers have even more to be worried about because if those funds go bust they won’t be there when you’re ready to retire. It’s already starting to happen. This year Social Security will pay out more in benefits than it receives in payroll taxes. The tipping point came sooner than anyone expected because the recession has kicked so many people off payrolls. But it was coming anyway. And it adds new urgency to reforming Social Security — a task the president’s commission on the nation’s debt is focusing on. So what’s the answer? Fed Chair Ben Bernanke this week listed the choices. “To avoid large and unsustainable budget deficits,” he said in a speech on Wednesday, “the nation must choose among higher taxes, modifications to entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare, less spending on everything else from education to defense, or some combination of the above.” Bernanke is almost certainly right about “some combination,” but he leaves out one other possible remedy that should be included in that combination: Immigration. You see, the biggest reason Social Security is in trouble, and Medicare as well, is because America is aging so fast. It’s not just that so many boomers are retiring. It’s also that seniors are living longer. And families are having fewer children. Add it all up and the number of people who are working relative to the number who are retired keeps shrinking. Forty years ago there were five workers for every retiree. Now there are three. Within a couple of decades, there will be only two workers per retiree. There’s no way just two workers will be able or willing to pay enough payroll taxes to keep benefits flowing to every retiree. This is where immigration comes in. Most immigrants are young because the impoverished countries they come from are demographically the opposite of rich countries. Rather than aging populations, their populations are bursting with young people. Yes, I know: There aren’t enough jobs right now even for Americans who want and need them. But once the American economy recovers, there will be. Take a long-term view and most new immigrants to the U.S. will be working for many decades. Get it? One logical way to deal with the crisis of funding Social Security and Medicare is to have more workers per retiree, and the simplest way to do that is to allow more immigrants into the United States. Immigration reform and entitlement reform have a lot to do with one another.</span><br />
<span class="Underline">US key to the global economy</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Caploe ‘9 (David Caploe is CEO of the Singapore-incorporated American Centre for Applied Liberal Arts and Humanities in Asia., “Focus still on America to lead global recovery”, April 7, The Strait Times, lexis)</span><br />
<span class="Underline">IN THE aftermath of the G-20 summit, most observers seem to have missed perhaps the most crucial statement of the entire event, made by United States President Barack Obama at his pre-conference meeting with British Prime Minister Gordon Brown: 'The world has become accustomed to the US being a voracious consumer market, the engine that drives a lot of economic growth worldwide,' he said. 'If there is going to be renewed growth, it just can't be the US as the engine.' While superficially sensible, this view is deeply problematic. To begin with, it ignores the fact that the global economy has in fact been 'America-centred' for more than 60 years. Countries - China, Japan, Canada, Brazil, Korea, Mexico and so on - either sell to the US or they sell to countries that sell to the US. This system has generally been advantageous for all concerned. America gained certain historically unprecedented benefits, but the system also enabled participating countries - first in Western Europe and Japan, and later, many in the Third World - to achieve undreamt-of prosperity. At the same time, this deep inter-connection between the US and the rest of the world also explains how the collapse of a relatively small sector of the US economy - 'sub-prime' housing, logarithmically exponentialised by Wall Street's ingenious chicanery - has cascaded into the worst global economic crisis since the Great Depression. To put it simply, Mr Obama doesn't seem to understand that there is no other engine for the world economy - and hasn't been for the last six decades. If the US does not drive global economic growth, growth is not going to happen. Thus, US policies to deal with the current crisis are critical not just domestically, but also to the entire world. Consequently, it is a matter of global concern that the Obama administration seems to be following Japan's 'model' from the 1990s: allowing major banks to avoid declaring massive losses openly and transparently, and so perpetuating 'zombie' banks - technically alive but in reality dead. As analysts like Nobel laureates Joseph Stiglitz and Paul Krugman have pointed out, the administration's unwillingness to confront US banks is the main reason why they are continuing their increasingly inexplicable credit freeze, thus ravaging the American and global economies. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">The Bush years have of course revealed the perils of drawing facile parallels between the challenges of the present day and the great catastrophes of the 20th century. Nevertheless, there is reason to fear that the biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression could have comparable consequences for the international system. For more than a decade, I pondered the question of why the 20th century was characterized by so much brutal upheaval. I pored over primary and secondary literature. I wrote more than 800 pages on the subject. And ultimately I concluded, in The War of the World, that three factors made the location and timing of lethal organized violence more or less predictable in the last century. The first factor was ethnic disintegration: Violence was worst in areas of mounting ethnic tension. The second factor was economic volatility: The greater the magnitude of economic shocks, the more likely conflict was. And the third factor was empires in decline: When structures of imperial rule crumbled, battles for political power were most bloody. In at least one of the world’s regions—the greater Middle East—two of these three factors have been present for some time: Ethnic conflict has been rife there for decades, and following the difficulties and disappointments in Iraq and Afghanistan, the United States already seems likely to begin winding down its quasi-imperial presence in the region. It likely still will. Now the third variable, economic volatility, has returned with a vengeance. U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke’s “Great Moderation”—the supposed decline of economic volatility that he hailed in a 2004 lecture—has been obliterated by a financial chain reaction, beginning in the U.S. subprime mortgage market, spreading through the banking system, reaching into the “shadow” system of credit based on securitization, and now triggering collapses in asset prices and economic activity around the world. After nearly a decade of unprecedented growth, the global economy will almost certainly sputter along in 2009, though probably not as much as it did in the early 1930s, because governments worldwide are frantically trying to repress this new depression. But no matter how low interest rates go or how high deficits rise, there will be a substantial increase in unemployment in most economies this year and a painful decline in incomes. Such economic pain nearly always has geopolitical consequences. Indeed, we can already see the first symptoms of the coming upheaval. In the essays that follow, Jeffrey Gettleman describes Somalia’s endless anarchy, Arkady Ostrovsky analyzes Russia’s new brand of aggression, and Sam Quinones explores Mexico’s drug-war-fueled misery. These, however, are just three case studies out of a possible nine or more. In Gaza, Israel has engaged in a bloody effort to weaken Hamas. But whatever was achieved militarily must be set against the damage Israel did to its international image by killing innocent civilians that Hamas fighters use as human shields. Perhaps more importantly, social and economic conditions in Gaza, which were already bad enough, are now abysmal. This situation is hardly likely to strengthen the forces of moderation among Palestinians. Worst of all, events in Gaza have fanned the flames of Islamist radicalism throughout the region—not least in Egypt. From Cairo to Riyadh, governments will now think twice before committing themselves to any new Middle East peace initiative. Iran, meanwhile, continues to support both Hamas and its Shiite counterpart in Lebanon, Hezbollah, and to pursue an alleged nuclear weapons program that Israelis legitimately see as a threat to their very existence. No one can say for sure what will happen next within Tehran’s complex political system, but it is likely that the radical faction around President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad will be strengthened by the Israeli onslaught in Gaza. Economically, however, Iran is in a hole that will only deepen as oil prices fall further. Strategically, the country risks disaster by proceeding with its nuclear program, because even a purely Israeli air offensive would be hugely disruptive. All this risk ought to point in the direction of conciliation, even accommodation, with the United States. But with presidential elections in June, Ahmadinejad has little incentive to be moderate. On Iran’s eastern border, in Afghanistan, upheaval remains the disorder of the day. Fresh from the success of the “surge” in Iraq, Gen. David Petraeus, the new head of U.S. Central Command, is now grappling with the much more difficult problem of pacifying Afghanistan. The task is made especially difficult by the anarchy that prevails in neighboring Pakistan. India, meanwhile, accuses some in Pakistan of having had a hand in the Mumbai terrorist attacks of last November, spurring yet another South Asian war scare. Remember: The sabers they are rattling have nuclear tips. The democratic governments in Kabul and Islamabad are two of the weakest anywhere. Among the biggest risks the world faces this year is that one or both will break down amid escalating violence. Once again, the economic crisis is playing a crucial role. Pakistan’s small but politically powerful middle class has been slammed by the collapse of the country’s stock market. Meanwhile, a rising proportion of the country’s huge population of young men are staring unemployment in the face. It is not a recipe for political stability. This club is anything but exclusive. Candidate members include Indonesia, Thailand, and Turkey, where there are already signs that the economic crisis is exacerbating domestic political conflicts. And let us not forget the plague of piracy in Somalia, the renewed civil war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the continuing violence in Sudan’s Darfur region, and the heart of darkness that is Zimbabwe under President Robert Mugabe. The axis of upheaval has many members. And it’s a fairly safe bet that the roster will grow even longer this year. The problem is that, as in the 1930s, most countries are looking inward, grappling with the domestic consequences of the economic crisis and paying little attention to the wider world crisis. This is true even of the United States, which is now so preoccupied with its own economic problems that countering global upheaval looks like an expensive luxury. With the U.S. rate of GDP growth set to contract between 2 and 3 percentage points this year, and with the official unemployment rate likely to approach 10 percent, all attention in Washington will remain focused on a nearly $1 trillion stimulus package. Caution has been thrown to the wind by both the Federal Reserve and the Treasury. The projected deficit for 2009 is already soaring above the trillion-dollar mark, more than 8 percent of GDP. Few commentators are asking what all this means for U.S. foreign policy. The answer is obvious: The resources available for policing the world are certain to be reduced for the foreseeable future. That will be especially true if foreign investors start demanding higher yields on the bonds they buy from the United States or simply begin dumping dollars in exchange for other currencies. Economic volatility, plus ethnic disintegration, plus an empire in decline: That combination is about the most lethal in geopolitics. We now have all three. The age of upheaval starts now.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">Unpredictable legislation and regulation is coming, and it will destroy the reforestation sector – the H2A revision proves</span><br />

<span class="Underline">While it has taken a backseat to the state of the economy and the health care debate, immigration reform is another polarizing issue that has consequences that stretch farther than what most of us realize. Some want to build a wall while others want to grant amnesty. Mike Kelly, the president of Mike Kelly Forestry Services, Inc., just wants to be able to put trees in the ground the same way he has for the past 24 years – employing temporary foreign workers through the H2B Non-Agriculture visa program. The reforestation industry’s dependence on temporary workers has become one of several pawns in the political chess game that is being played out in Washington. Since December of 2008, forestry contractors, such as Kelly have witnessed four significant changes in the US Governments H2A guest worker program that would affect how they are going to be able to legally comply with the United States Department of Labor’s visa programs in 2010. “We need a set of rules that matches what the realities are out here on the ground,” stated a frustrated Kelly. “This industry ebbs and flows with timber markets – weather conditions – we need rules that reflect an understanding of the circumstances that we are up against out here in order to get a job done.” On September 4, 2009 The Department of Labor proposed a radical change in how reforestation contractors use the guest worker program. Kelly predicts that if the latest mandate – a call to shift reforestation contractors out of the H2B non-agriculture visa program and into the H2A agriculture visa program – the reforestation industry as we know it will be finished. “The majority of the tree planting contractors in this country rely heavily on temporary workers,” stated Kelly. “It’s a simple fact that most of all tree planting in this country is done by temporary workers. If we lose this program, it will be a real challenge to meet the replanting and other reforestation needs of our country.” The H2A visa program is tailored towards the agriculture community. Among the countless rules in the program, the H2A visa program requires that workers be provided with free housing that must be inspected by a government official prior to inhabitance and the workers are limited to a 50 to 75-mile radius of that residence. These two elements alone would put most, if not all, tree planters out of business because it would just be impossible to execute. “The H2A program is an agricultural program,” stated Kelly. “Primarily for people who once you bring the workers in, they are working on one farm within a reasonable amount of distance from where they are housed. What they are not taking into account – is that we are not able to do that – our work is scattered over a much broader geographical area.” Working under the H2B visa program since 1986, reforestation contractors are afforded the ability to submit an itinerary that allows them to move workers throughout the country based on the workload. While the H2B program demands the completion of a ream of paperwork and additional costs on tree planters, for planters such as Kelly, it had become a necessary burden that he had learned to live with – that is until the tampering with the program began in September 2009. “I am probably as close to being able to meet the requirements of the proposed H2A visa revisions because I am very regional, primarily in North Carolina, but even I can’t,” stated Kelly who considers himself a small player in this industry. Kelly typically employs a crew of 15-18 men and on occasion has run two crews based on the demand for his services. “Most of my work is within a 50-to-75 mile radius of my home base,” explained Kelly. “Some of my clients have work on the coast or near the Virginia border. If I had to comply with H2A rules, I would have to go through the whole recertification process once I have moved beyond the 75 mile distance and bring in separate workers or go through a lengthy and costly transfer process of visas to another certificate - even if it is only for a few days work.” So what’s at stake? Last year, one southeast state failed to meet its reforestation goals because of the shortage of tree planters. Private landowners throughout the nation would be hard pressed to find companies that were still able to compete while staying in legal compliance with the H2A visa program. Kelly and some of his fellow contractors from across the U.S. have formed the Forestry Contractors Task Force. The Task Force is now made up of companies large and small from all regions throughout the United States. They joined ranks with The Forest Resources Association to begin to lobby Washington for some clarification and quite frankly, some clear, realistic thinking, on this every changing issue. “The Task Forces’ membership is growing,” stated Kelly. “We have had more people come on board recently when they realized that if we don’t do something collectively, we are facing some serious trouble. The future and survival of our industry is at stake.” In the public policy arena, the legal use of temporary workers is a focus for a few special interest groups within the Washington beltline – one that would like to see the jobs filled with American workers – another who argue about the conditions the temporary workers operate in – and even another who would like to see all temporary work programs go away as part of a new amnesty policy for individuals who failed to enter the country through proper channels. Collectively, these different agendas are no doubt the source for this latest major assault on the program. For Kelly, the concern raised about his workforce is pure speculation by people who have no clue how this industry operates. The proof is the planting, so to speak. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">The southern United States has some of the world’s most intensively managed forests. Seventy-nine percent of the total acres planted in trees in the United States were in the Southern region. Most were planted by Latin American migrant laborers. Research found that contractors complained American workers were unwilling to do manual labor. The need for cheap and reliable labor has driven the forest industry to seek labor outside our borders. According to research at Auburn University, migrant laborers plant the nearly 2 million acres of trees every winter in the South. They are recruited through a temporary nine-month H-2B Guest Worker visa program. H-2B migrant laborers, prevalent in the South since the late 1980s have transformed the southern landscape from dwindling agriculture to booming forestry. Labor laws The H-2B Guest Worker program was implemented after the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. This program was designed to prevent employers from hiring illegal workers. It was designed to provide temporary labor to employers who could demonstrate a shortage of local labor in nonagriculture seasonal jobs. In 2004, migrant labor constituted 84 percent of the forest management labor force, according to Auburn research. Reforestation and herbicide applications are heavily dominated by migrant labor. Dwindling profit margins and American laborers demanding higher wages led the forestry industry to depend on &quot;imported&quot; labor. In 2005, about 89,000 laborers worked under the H-2B program in forestry, seafood processing, landscaping, construction and other nonagriculture jobs.

<span class="Underline">Forests are more than a symbolic ideal of wilderness, more than quiet places to enjoy nature. Forest ecosystems -- trees, soil, undergrowth, all living things in a forest -- are critical to maintaining life on earth. Forests help us breathe by creating oxygen and filtering pollutants from the air, and help stabilize the global climate by absorbing carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas. They soak up rainfall like giant sponges, preventing floods and purifying water that we drink. They provide habitat for 90 percent of the plant and animal species that live on land, as well as homelands for many of the earth's last remaining indigenous cultures. Forests are commercially important, too; they yield valuable resources like wood, rubber and medicinal plants, including plants used to create cancer drugs. Harvesting these resources provides employment for local communities. Healthy forests are a critical part of the web of life. Yet more than half of the earth's original forest cover has been destroyed due to human activity such as agriculture, development and logging. Much of the loss has occurred within the past three decades. Protecting the earth's remaining forest cover is now an urgent task.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">America's richly, diverse forests provide vital products and amenities to our society. Through scientific management, sustained production of pulpwood, saw timber, veneer, poles, and chemical by-products is possible from our forests. Our nation's privately-owned forests also provide many important values not found on developed lands, including: quality habitat for wildlife, biodiversity of plant and animal communities, clean water, aesthetic benefits and recreational opportunities. As one of the 10 million non-industrial private forest landowners in America who own 59 percent of the nation's timberland, your forests, management objectives, and reasons you own forest land have a tremendous impact on the quality, productivity, and sustainability of our forests. As a landowner, your forest land offers you many values and opportunities. Implementing sustainable forestry practices on your forestland can secure the longevity of your forestry investment creating a valuable resource and heritage for future generations. Sustainable forestry can be viewed as the practice of a land stewardship ethic which integrates the reforestation, managing, growing, nurturing, and harvesting of trees for useful products with the conversation of soil, air, and water quality, wildlife and fish habitat, and aesthetics. Reforestation following harvest is the cornerstone of forest sustainability; therefore, a priority in forest management is establishing new stands of trees. Forest management is a cycle of renewal and harvest. Prompt reforestation ensures that new forests are in place to prevent soil erosion and protect water quality in streams and lakes. Many species of wildlife, such as quail, rabbit, deer, elk, moose, ruffed grouse and wild turkey, can be found using newly established forests for food, shelter and nesting. As a private landowner, your management objectives may or may not focus on growing forests to produce timber. Perhaps your interests center on managing wildlife habitat; creating aesthetically pleasing areas; protecting soil and water quality; or enhancing recreational opportunities, in addition to protecting and improving forest health and productivity. Practicing sustainable forestry goes beyond emphasizing production of timber from the forest to a philosophy of sustaining all forest values and the inherent ability to produce them. Prompt reforestation is a key to practicing sustainable forestry and ensures that impacts on other forest values from harvesting are managed to obtain the maximum benefits possible. Reforestation Opportunities Site preparation, planting, clearcutting, natural regeneration, uneven-aged management, direct seeding, group selection…. do you feel it is a daunting task to choose the &quot;best&quot; reforestation and management technique? Often, no single technique is &quot;best&quot;; your forest management objectives can likely be achieved using several different reforestation and management techniques. A good way to start sorting out your options is to become familiar with the practices used for reforestation in your area. Seek the advice of a professional forester to help you evaluate and plan effective reforestation practices to meet your forest management objectives. Your forest site, the species composition of you forest, and local markets dictate reforestation systems that are biologically and economically feasible.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">Compared to prehistoric times, the level of oxygen in the earth's atmosphere has declined by over a third and in polluted cities the decline may be more than 50%. This change in the makeup of the air we breathe has potentially serious implications for our health. Indeed, it could ultimately threaten the survival of human life on earth, according to Roddy Newman, who is drafting a new book, The Oxygen Crisis. I am not a scientist, but this seems a reasonable concern. It is a possibility that we should examine and assess. So, what's the evidence? Around 10,000 years ago, the planet's forest cover was at least twice what it is today, which means that forests are now emitting only half the amount of oxygen. Desertification and deforestation are rapidly accelerating this long-term loss of oxygen sources. The story at sea is much the same. NASA reports that in the north Pacific ocean oxygen-producing phytoplankton concentrations are 30% lower today, compared to the 1980s. This is a huge drop in just three decades. Moreover, the UN environment programme confirmed in 2004 that there were nearly 150 &quot;dead zones&quot; in the world's oceans where discharged sewage and industrial waste, farm fertiliser run-off and other pollutants have reduced oxygen levels to such an extent that most or all sea creatures can no longer live there. This oxygen starvation is reducing regional fish stocks and diminishing the food supplies of populations that are dependent on fishing. It also causes genetic mutations and hormonal changes that can affect the reproductive capacity of sea life, which could further diminish global fish supplies. Professor Robert Berner of Yale University has researched oxygen levels in prehistoric times by chemically analysing air bubbles trapped in fossilised tree amber. He suggests that humans breathed a much more oxygen-rich air 10,000 years ago. Further back, the oxygen levels were even greater. Robert Sloan has listed the percentage of oxygen in samples of dinosaur-era amber as: 28% (130m years ago), 29% (115m years ago), 35% (95m years ago), 33% (88m years ago), 35% (75m years ago), 35% (70m years ago), 35% (68m years ago), 31% (65.2m years ago), and 29% (65m years ago). Professor Ian Plimer of Adelaide University and Professor Jon Harrison of the University of Arizona concur. Like most other scientists they accept that oxygen levels in the atmosphere in prehistoric times averaged around 30% to 35%, compared to only 21% today – and that the levels are even less in densely populated, polluted city centres and industrial complexes, perhaps only 15 % or lower. Much of this recent, accelerated change is down to human activity, notably the industrial revolution and the burning of fossil fuels. The Professor of Geological Sciences at Notre Dame University in Indiana, J Keith Rigby, was quoted in 1993-1994 as saying: In the 20th century, humanity has pumped increasing amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere by burning the carbon stored in coal, petroleum and natural gas. In the process, we've also been consuming oxygen and destroying plant life – cutting down forests at an alarming rate and thereby short-circuiting the cycle's natural rebound. We're artificially slowing down one process and speeding up another, forcing a change in the atmosphere. Very interesting. But does this decline in oxygen matter? Are there any practical consequences that we ought to be concerned about? What is the effect of lower oxygen levels on the human body? Does it disrupt and impair our immune systems and therefore make us more prone to cancer and degenerative diseases? Surprisingly, no significant research has been done, perhaps on the following presumption: the decline in oxygen levels has taken place over millions of years of our planet's existence. The changes during the shorter period of human life have also been slow and incremental – until the last two centuries of rapid urbanisation and industrialisation. Surely, this mostly gradual decline has allowed the human body to evolve and adapt to lower concentrations of oxygen? Maybe, maybe not. The pace of oxygen loss is likely to have speeded up massively in the last three decades, with the industrialisation of China, India, South Korea and other countries, and as a consequence of the massive worldwide increase in the burning of fossil fuels. In the view of Professor Ervin Laszlo, the drop in atmospheric oxygen has potentially serious consequences. A UN advisor who has been a professor of philosophy and systems sciences, Laszlo writes: Evidence from prehistoric times indicates that the oxygen content of pristine nature was above the 21% of total volume that it is today. It has decreased in recent times due mainly to the burning of coal in the middle of the last century. Currently the oxygen content of the Earth's atmosphere dips to 19% over impacted areas, and it is down to 12 to 17% over the major cities. At these levels it is difficult for people to get sufficient oxygen to maintain bodily health: it takes a proper intake of oxygen to keep body cells and organs, and the entire immune system, functioning at full efficiency. At the levels we have reached today cancers and other degenerative diseases are likely to develop. And at 6 to 7% life can no longer be sustained.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">But it isn't just the destruction of the rainforests that should trouble us. Healthy ecosystems the world over provide hidden services like waste disposal, nutrient cycling, soil formation, water purification, and oxygen production. Such services are best rendered by ecosystems that are diverse. Yet, through both intention and accident, humans have introduced exotic species that turn biodiversity into monoculture. Fast-growing zebra mussels, for example, have outcompeted more than 15 species of native mussels in North America's Great Lakes and have damaged harbors and water-treatment plants. Native prairies are becoming dominated by single species (often genetically homogenous) of corn or wheat. Thanks to these developments, soils will erode and become unproductive - which, along with temperature change, will diminish agricultural yields. Meanwhile,with increased pollution and runoff, as well as reduced forest cover, ecosystems will no longer be able to purify water; and a shortage of clean water spells disaster. In many ways, oceans are the most vulnerable areas of all. As overfishing eliminates major predators, while polluted and warming waters kill off phytoplankton, the intricate aquatic food web could collapse from both sides. Fish, on which so many humans depend, will be a fond memory. As phytoplankton vanish, so does the ability of the oceans to absorb carbon dioxide and produce oxygen. (Half of the oxygen we breathe is made by phytoplankton, with the rest coming from land plants.) Species extinction is also imperiling coral reefs - a major problem since these reefs have far more than recreational value: They provide tremendous amounts of food for human populations and buffer coastlines against erosion. In fact, the global value of &quot;hidden&quot; services provided by ecosystems - those services, like waste disposal, that aren't bought and sold in the marketplace - has been estimated to be as much as $50 trillion per year, roughly equal to the gross domestic product of all countries combined. And that doesn't include tangible goods like fish and timber. Life as we know it would be impossible if ecosystems collapsed. Yet that is where we're heading if species extinction continues at its current pace. Extinction also has a huge impact on medicine. Who really cares if, say, a worm in the remote swamps of French Guiana goes extinct? Well, those who suffer from cardiovascular disease. The recent discovery of a rare South American leech has led to the isolation of a powerful enzyme that, unlike other anticoagulants, not only prevents blood from clotting but also dissolves existing clots. And it's not just this one species of worm: Its wriggly relatives have evolved other biomedically valuable proteins, including antistatin (a potential anticancer agent), decorsin and ornatin (platelet aggregation inhibitors), and hirudin (another anticoagulant). Plants, too, are pharmaceutical gold mines. The bark of trees, for example, has given us quinine (the first cure for malaria), taxol (a drug highly effective against ovarian and breast cancer), and aspirin. More than a quarter of the medicines on our pharmacy shelves were originally derived from plants. The sap of the Madagascar periwinkle contains more than 70 useful alkaloids, including vincristine, a powerful anticancer drug that saved the life of one of our friends. Of the roughly 250,000 plant species on Earth, fewer than 5 percent have been screened for pharmaceutical properties. Who knows what life-saving drugs remain to be discovered? Given current extinction rates, it's estimated that we're losing one valuable drug every two years. Our arguments so far have tacitly assumed that species are worth saving only in proportion to their economic value and their effects on our quality of life, an attitude that is strongly ingrained, especially in Americans. That is why conservationists always base their case on an economic calculus. But we biologists know in our hearts that there are deeper and equally compelling reasons to worry about the loss of biodiversity: namely, simple morality and intellectual values that transcend pecuniary interests. What, for example, gives us the right to destroy other creatures? And what could be more thrilling than looking around us, seeing that we are surrounded by our evolutionary cousins, and realizing that we all got here by the same simple process of natural selection? To biologists, and potentially everyone else, apprehending the genetic kinship and common origin of all species is a spiritual experience - not necessarily religious, but spiritual nonetheless, for it stirs the soul. But, whether or not one is moved by such concerns, it is certain that our future is bleak if we do nothing to stem this sixth extinction. We are creating a world in which exotic diseases flourish but natural medicinal cures are lost; a world in which carbon waste accumulates while food sources dwindle; a world of sweltering heat, failing crops, and impure water. In the end, we must accept the possibility that we ourselves are not immune to extinction</span><br />

<span class="Underline">An article in the October 16, 1998 issue of Science (see also ABSNews.com report) by S. Fan and others presents evidence that North America's second-growth forests south of latitude 51 absorb 1.7 (SE = 0.5) billion tons of atmospheric carbon annually. This claim, which is based on a study of north-to-south and west-to-east atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration gradients, is in sharp conflict with estimates derived from measurements of forest production. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations (2), forest production in the whole of North America (including the vast boreal forest, which lies north of latitude 51), is just under one billion cubic metres of harvestable stemwood per year. The FAO estimates North America's total timber harvest at just under 0.6 billion cubic metres of stemwood per year. Net accumulation of standing timber is thus estimated to be approximately 0.4 billion cubic metres per year, representing the accumulation of approximately 100 million tons of carbon. To this might be added up to 150 million tons of carbon contained in the 0.6 billion cubic metres of harvested timber on the optimistic assumption that all is converted to products which either have a life time comparable to that of a forest, or are indefinitely recycled without loss. An annual increment of one hundred million tons of carbon in harvestable timber implies an accumulation of approximately 150 million tons of carbon in whole-tree biomass (i.e., including leaves, branches and roots as well as harvestable stemwood). In addition, carbon accumulates in forest soils in the form of leaf and branch litter, dead stems and roots. The accumulation of soil organic matter can exceed that in living biomass by a factor of as much as two. Thus, based on the FAO data, one can estimate that North America's forests comprise a sink for, at most, 150 million tons each in living forest biomass and harvested wood products, plus 300 million tons in forest soil organic matter, for a total of 600 million tons annually. But this implies a North American carbon sink only one-third the size of that inferred in the Science paper. If the Science paper is correct, it implies that ground-based estimates of forest yield have overlooked two-thirds of North America's annual accumulation of timber (i.e., growth less timber harvested), or about 1.2 billion cubic metres. It might seem difficult to overlook that much wood--more than a cubic kilometer added to inventory each year. However, the undetected additional volume would be spread over 0.8 billion hectares, and would thus amount to no more than a millimeter or two in annual mean tree diameter growth, or just one or two cubic metres of timber per hectare. Given that ground-based estimates of forest yield are dependent on plot measurements made over many years, some dating back more than half a century, they may not reflect the impact on tree growth of recent changes in climate and atmospheric chemistry. As the authors of the Science paper note, a small rise in temperature, accompanied by increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, nitrogen deposition rates and precipitation may provide a more potent stimulus to forest production than has yet been generally recognized. But the results reported by Fan et al. are based on a limited data set and need confirmation with results from a more comprehensive atmospheric sampling network than that available at present. In the meantime, the study is bound to stir controversy. The United States and Canada, as signatories of the Kyoto agreement, must take steps to regulate their net carbon emissions. However, with combined emissions from fossil fuel combustion of 1.6 billion tons per year, i.e., less than the inferred forest carbon sink, both countries may be net absorbers of carbon. Whatever the true magnitude of the North American forest carbon sink, the report by Fan et al. emphasizes the central role that forests play in regulating the composition of the atmosphere. If a massive North American forest carbon sink is confirmed, it will have major and, on the whole fortunate, implications; among them that timber, a vital industrial raw material, will be in abundant supply for the foreseeable future. North America alone could, if necessary, supply all of present world timber demand on a sustainable basis. Further, the result implies that the productivity of second-growth forests in North America is so large that there is no urgent economic justification for allowing further inroads into North America's remaining stands of old-growth timber until their role both as a carbon reservoir in the global carbon cycle and in the maintenance of biodiversity has been clarified.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">Carbon. From the time when the first living organisms coalesced in a sea permeated with long-chained molecules, this element has been essential to life on earth. Like water and oxygen, we cannot live without it. Carbon’s importance arises from its crucial provision of both structure and energy to living creatures. Carbon’s very long chains and rings are the backbones of most organic molecules. Break living bodies of any sort into organs, break the organs into cells, and the cells into molecules, look inside, and you will find a string of carbon atoms. If you could somehow pull all these carbon strings from the organism, little would remain of either the organism’s form or function. But carbon also flows through organisms and, when doing so, provides the energy that allows them to laugh, play, migrate, reproduce -- to perform virtually any function that we associate with being alive. This energy comes stored in the molecular bonds that hold the carbon chains together. Think about it. If you need an energy boost, you grab a CARBO-hydrate -- a food with quickly digested and readily available carbon compounds. Given the importance of long-chained carbon compounds, it was crucial that living creatures developed mechanisms for producing these complex molecules and assuring that they could be readily transferred from one organism to another. Hence the significance of the carbon cycle, which is diagrammed in a simplified form in Figure 1. Through this cycle, carbon (in the form of carbon dioxide, or CO2) is pulled from the atmosphere by green plants, which engage the sun’s energy to form the long carbon chains (a process called photosynthesis). The carbon chains, and the energy they contain, are then handed from one creature to another as a series of meals -- from corn to pig to human, from grass to rabbit to decomposing fungi. Eventually, the molecules release their energy and break back down to emit CO2 (a process called respiration). The CO2 released into the atmosphere plays another crucial role. CO2, with other greenhouse gases, provides an insulating blanket that holds in the sun’s warmth and heats the earth’s surface to a temperature that is hospitable to life -- about 60°F warmer than it would be otherwise. </span><br />

We know now that those vaults can be opened to fuel a forest or our own bodies, our cars, our hospitals, and our factories. The trick is not how to do so -- it’s how to do so in a sustainable manner. It’s how to maintain the cycles so that carbon can continue to provide balanced services -- as a global temperature regulator as well as an energy source and structural building block for life on earth. CGRER’s research is directed toward further deciphering and better tending the intricacies of the carbon cycle so that the earth’s thin film of carbon-dependent life can continue to flourish.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">The Northeast Blackout of 2003; the breached levees of New Orleans in 2005; and the Minneapolis I-35W bridge collapse of 2007 are all perilous signals that U.S. infrastructure is crumbling and jeopardizing our national security, a prominent homeland security expert warned Thursday. Yet despite these warning signs, Americans don’t want to invest in its maintenance, let alone spend money to upgrade it, said Dr. Stephen Flynn, the new president of the Center for National Policy (CNP), a bipartisan national security think tank that hosted the discussion about U.S. crumbling infrastructure. “We are a generation that is arguably like grandkids who have inherited a mansion and most of us decide we’re not going to do the upkeep,” he said. “People drive by and say ‘nice house,’ but the plumbing’s gone to hell, the wiring’s shot.” Flynn was joined by writer James Fallows, national correspondent for The Atlantic Monthly, whose January cover article for the magazine explores how to keep the United States the envy of the world after the financial crisis. National Public Radio’s national security correspondent Tom Gjelten moderated the event. The discussion was made timelier by the devastation wrought by a catastrophic earthquake in Haiti on Tuesday, a society whose infrastructure is “broken,” according to Flynn. While no one tried to compare U.S. infrastructure to Haiti’s, the message was clear: no part of America ever wants to approximate that level of helplessness if disaster strikes. The discussion centered around how to convince the American public, representatives in Congress, and the national security community that investing and upgrading our infrastructure is not only good national security policy, it’s also good economic and social policy. But there's a prevailing pessimism infrastructure advocates must overcome if the argument is going to gain traction with the American public, Flynn said. The first perception is that United States cannot afford it. Second, Americans do not believe in the political process to complete massive projects. Rather they note “bridges to nowhere,” emblematic of Congress' corruption. Finally, Flynn said, Americans no longer have the faith in themselves to build an infrastructure necessary for 21st century America to retain its economic power. And even if proponents can get over those hurdles, they still have to sell why the U.S. should spend scarce resources on infrastructure and not other things. Fortunately there’s a national security argument from the past for infrastructure advocates, said Flynn. During the presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower, the former general explained to the American public that the country needed to build the interstate highway system, which he called the &quot;National Defense Highway System,&quot; to move resources quickly around the country and possibly evacuate cities if the Cold War ever turned hot. Fallows similarly argued that the only way to gain the American public’s attention is to evoke national security and emergency. “We have tremendous rebound capacity, but in terms of directing public attention, we seem to have only the military as a legitimate vehicle,” he said, adding “We seem to need an electric cattle prod of an emergency to do things and that’s a cause for worry.” But that’s a tricky proposition, both Flynn and Fallows observed, noting the hysteria following the botched terrorist attack on Christmas Day. Politicians and government can’t overreact, Flynn explains, because that’s what the terrorists hope to achieve. “If we say that the unofficial doctrine of this country is we will overreact every time something goes wrong, you’re actually motivating our adversaries to say ‘Let’s keep trying,’” he said. And because the United States is the world’s dominant military power, the only real way for enemies to attack the country is through its infrastructure, including cyberspace, making infrastructure resilience critical. “If [an attack] does happen, and very little of consequence happens, we get a national security benefit,” Flynn argued. “There’s a deterrent value to investing in this.” But if on the other hand adversaries can repeatedly attack a brittle critical infrastructure, Americans will lose faith in the everyday services and networks that are the source of U.S. prosperity and see them as a weaknesses.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">Five years after the worst blackout in North American history, the country’s largest utilities say the U.S. power system faces the prospect of even bigger and more damaging outages. The specific flaws that led to 50 million people losing power in 2003 have largely been addressed, they say, but even bigger problems loom. Excess generating capacity in the system is shrinking, for example, and power-plant construction has slowed as costs to build and operate plants have soared. At the same time, it is estimated that electricity use will increase 29 percent between 2006 to 2030 — much of it driven by residential growth, according to a government report issued in June. “I’m really not a ‘Chicken Little’ player, but I worry that no one seems to be focusing in on this,” said Michael Morris, chairman, president and chief executive of American Electric Power, which runs the nation’s largest electricity transmission system. Morris said massive outages this year in South Africa, which forced gold, diamond and platinum mines to stop production for five days, should serve as a warning to the United States. Industry experts back Morris and say there is even more resistance to building new plants because of the debate over climate change and opposition to new transmission lines. The blocking of two coal-fired plants in Kansas is one example of the resistance. “The level of excess capacity has shrunk … to a level barely within the planning toleration of the industry,” said Marc Chupka, with the Brattle Group, an energy consultant. The blackout five years ago shut off power to vast swaths of the Northeast and Midwest for as much as four days. Rolling blackouts continued in Ontario for a week. The outages caused as much as $10 billion in damages to the U.S. economy. FirstEnergy Corp. of Akron, Ohio, which got the blame for the spread of the outages, has worked to shore up its transmission system. But the larger issues of the country’s total generating ability and the overall health and capacity of the transmission grid remain a problem, the experts say. Rick Sergel, president of the North American Electric Reliability Corp., the agency that oversees the nation’s power grid, said, “We’re to the point where we need every possible resource: renewables, demand response and energy efficiency, nuclear, clean coal — you name it, we need it. And we especially need the transmission lines that will bring the power generated by these new resources to consumers.” Construction of coal-fired generating plants has almost stopped, and new nuclear plants are years away, if they are approved at all, said Arshad Mansoor, vice president of power delivery and use for the Electric Power Research Institute. Better efficiency will go only so far, he said. Morris, of American Electric Power, sees a potentially dire situation ahead, including the sort of power rationing that occurred in South Africa. “It would ruin the economy,” Morris said.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">A cultural shift has taken place in America that's tragically made the skilled worker a thing of the past. Our media has glorified celebrity at the expense of our nation's basic needs, and America will reap the whirlwind within the next two decades. At stake is nothing less than our long-term economic vitality and national security. Let's start with infrastructure — bridges, roads, water and sewer systems. America is dangerously close to failures that will result in loss of life and are already resulting in loss of economic competitiveness. In many cases, currently funded infrastructure projects cannot move forward due to lack of skilled workers. For example, a national shortage of 500,000 welders has resulted in delays or cancellations of many key projects. Expand that out over the entire economy and we have a massive crisis on our hands. By 2012, there will be a 3 million skilled worker shortfall in our nation, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. In Oklahoma, which has had solid energy and manufacturing industries, top companies have difficulty finding adequate skilled workers to fill positions. The average age of American skilled workers is 55, which means the bulk of our skilled worker base will retire in the next decade. There are not enough skilled workers to replace them and maintain the nation's competitive global position. In my interviews with employers across the nation, I hear the same story: Business owners are desperate for skilled workers. Many are reaching out to local schools to attract young people into the trades. Despite the offer of good pay and benefits, the noble skills that involve working with your hands and mind don't hold the same appeal as they did in decades past. Some businesses are considering moving their operations (and jobs) overseas. We're experiencing the loss of the once-vaunted edge that America enjoyed. From aviation to energy, our national security is at risk. In order to maintain the world's most sophisticated military, we must produce systems, parts and hardware in America. Without domestic manufacturing operations, critical component work has been moved offshore as a stop-gap measure. The lens through which I view the world is simple: The manual arts always take precedence over the fine arts. Remember, someone had to build the ceiling before Michelangelo could go to work. Negative images of skilled workers — what I call &quot;essential workers&quot; — pervade our culture. The truth is, high-profile athletes and entertainers are non-essential. If all the celebrities like me disappeared overnight, it would be sad, but the world would continue with little disruption. But if plumbers, electricians, welders, carpenters, lathe operators, truck drivers and other &quot;essentials&quot; disappeared, our country would grind to a halt. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">America’s top intelligence official told lawmakers on Tuesday that Al Qaeda and its affiliates had made it a high priority to attempt a large-scale attack on American soil within the next six months. The assessment by Dennis C. Blair, the director of national intelligence, was much starker than his view last year, when he emphasized the considerable progress in the campaign to debilitate Al Qaeda and said that the global economic meltdown, rather than the prospect of a major terrorist attack, was the “primary near-term security concern of the United States.” At Tuesday’s hearing, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California and chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, asked Mr. Blair to assess the possibility of an attempted attack in the United States in the next three to six months. He replied, “The priority is certain, I would say” — a response that was reaffirmed by the top officials of the C.I.A. and the F.B.I. Citing a recent wave of terrorist plots, including the failed Dec. 25 attempt to blow up an airliner as it approached Detroit, Mr. Blair and other intelligence officials told a Senate panel that Al Qaeda had adjusted its tactics to more effectively strike American targets domestically and abroad. “The biggest threat is not so much that we face an attack like 9/11,” said Leon E. Panetta, the C.I.A. director. “It is that Al Qaeda is adapting its methods in ways that oftentimes make it difficult to detect.” As the C.I.A. continues its drone attacks aimed at Qaeda operatives in Pakistan, the officials also said that the network’s splinter groups in Yemen and Somalia were taking on more importance. But Mr. Blair began his annual threat testimony before Congress by saying that the threat of a crippling attack on telecommunications and other computer networks was growing, as an increasingly sophisticated group of enemies had “severely threatened” the sometimes fragile systems undergirding the country’s information infrastructure. “Malicious cyberactivity is occurring on an unprecedented scale with extraordinary sophistication,” he told the committee. His emphasis on the threat points up the growing concerns among American intelligence officials about the potentially devastating results of a coordinated attack on the nation’s technology apparatus, sometimes called a “cyber-Pearl Harbor.” He said that the surge in cyberattacks, including the penetration of Google’s servers from inside China, was a “wake-up call” for those who dismissed the threat of computer warfare. “Sensitive information is stolen daily from both government and private-sector networks, undermining confidence in our information systems, and in the very information these systems were intended to convey,” Mr. Blair said. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">That decks the ENTIRE GRID – results in runaway blackouts </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Al-Qaeda sources announced that they are responsible for the recent power blackout in America. One more lie to add to a thousand tall tales spun by hidden terrorists. In fact, the recent power blackout actually demonstrated that the electric computer network operated correctly. The blackout began when a critical main line went down, leaving the rest of the network to carry the electrical load. The network noted that the load was too much to carry and began to shut itself down. The so-called &quot;domino&quot; effect began as each segment of the grid detected an overload and shut down, including 10 nuclear power plants that &quot;scrammed&quot; (shut down) automatically. If hackers had had control of the network, they would have overridden the shutdown commands. The override would have caused physical damage to the network, burning out transformers and switching stations as they tried to carry the excess power. The result would have been millions of dollars in damages, and weeks without electrical power for millions of Americans. Instead, the power companies were able to take care of the specific overload and re-establish electrical power within hours. The power blackout may have been an inept hack attack but it is doubtful – simply because there was little physical damage to the electrical grid. One reason why I doubt Al-Qaeda’s claim is because the 10 nuclear power plants located in the blackout area all shut down per pre-programmed safety procedures. If hackers had been able to penetrate the computer networks, they might have been able to override the automatic &quot;scram&quot; sequences inside the nuclear power plants. This frightful scenario ends with an atomic meltdown. Air Force Hackers Succeed In comparison, the U.S. Air Force recently conducted a successful simulated attack against the American power grid. Hackers from the South Carolina-based cyber war squadron were able to penetrate the fragile power grid on the West Coast. The Air Force hackers could have brought down the electrical grid from Seattle to San Diego. Computer security is something that does not come naturally to government or business authorities. It is viewed as an expense of doing business, something that must be kept to a bare minimum. I once served as security adviser for Virginia Government Internet Committee and co-wrote the information security requirements for the state in its final report to the Virginia Commonwealth Legislature. The report was requested by Gov. Doug Wilder (D) and accepted by Gov. George Allen (R). I spent months in meetings and hundreds of hours compiling evidence for the state to set up a strong information security policy. For the most part the rest of the committee ignored the evidence and the recommendations. Until one day when a group of system administrators from another state came to show off their brand new computer network. Many of the members were fascinated by the performance of this computer network – until I managed to squeeze in a single question about the security of their system. &quot;Oh,&quot; one of the administrators replied, &quot;we have not had any real problems with security except when a hacker used our system to get into a nuclear power plant.&quot; At that moment you could have heard a pin drop. Every talking head in the room fell silent and nearly a hundred eyes focused on the now nervous computer administrator. &quot;How did you find the hacker?&quot; I asked, pressing my point. &quot;We didn’t. The nuclear power plant contacted us and we shut down the open connections,&quot; she replied. Suddenly computer security became the hot topic. The potential use of a government-owned computer network to hack into a nuclear power plant frightened every politician and bureaucrat in the room. In the end, the committee unanimously agreed to accept all of my security proposals. Entire Networks Are Vulnerable It may come as a shocking surprise, but many of the U.S. electrical power grid computer networks are unprotected. You actually have more security sending your credit card number over the Internet than the control commands that operate your electric power do.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">And if you detonate a single nuclear weapon in the upper atmosphere you will produce an electric magnetic pulse, or EMP. One nuclear weapon detonated in near space would therefore melt down the entire electronic communications network of the United States. This would of course ruin the U.S. economy and utterly disrupt society across the country. But it would have even more grave consequences. There are 103 nuclear power plants across the United States. They all rely on external electricity supply that powers their water-coolant systems. If these were all knocked out, you would run the risk of more than 100 Chernobyl-scale nuclear core meltdowns across the United States. All the power plants have their own back-up generators, of course, but they would all need time crank up and too often their testing and maintenance has been neglected because they so seldom, if ever, have had to be used in the past, and some of them don't work when they're supposed to. Therefore there would indeed be a real risk of many Chernobyls all over the place. Thus a single EMP detonation in space aimed against U.S. military space-based assets could produce a truly cataclysmic outcome, and it would be very easy to do. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">The terrorist act can reactivate atavistic defense mechanisms which drive us to gather around clan chieftans. Nationalistic sentiment re-awakens, setting up an implacable frontier which divides &quot;us&quot; from &quot;them,&quot; each group solidifying its cohesion in a rising hate/fear of the other group. (Remember Yugoslavia?) To be sure, the allies are trying for the moment to avoid the language of polarization, insisting that &quot;this is not a war,&quot; that it is &quot;not against Islam,&quot; &quot;civilians will not be targeted.&quot; But the word &quot;war&quot; was pronounced, a word heavy with significance which forces the issue of partisanship. And it must be understood that the sentiment of partisanship, of belonging to the group, is one of the strongest of human emotions. Because the enemy has been named in the media (Islam), the situation has become emotionally volatile. Another spectacular attack, coming on top of an economic recession could easily radicalize the latent attitudes of the United States, and also of Europe, where racial prejudices are especially close to the surface and ask no more than a pretext to burst out. This is the Sarajevo syndrome: an isolated act of madness becomes the pretext for a war that is just as mad, made of ancestral rancor, measureless ambitions, and armies in search of a war. We should not be fooled by our expressions of good will and charity toward the innocent victims of this or other distant wars. It is our own comfortable circumstances which permit us these benevolent sentiments. If conditions change so that poverty and famine put the fear of starvation in our guts, the human beast will reappear. And if epidemic becomes a clear and present danger, fear will unleash hatred in the land of the free, flinging missiles indiscriminately toward any supposed havens of the unseen enemy. And on the other side, no matter how profoundly complex and differentiated Islamic nations and tribes may be, they will be forced to behave as one clan by those who see advantage in radicalizing the conflict, whether they be themselves merchants or terrorists.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">Nationwide, unemployment is up; but does that necessarily mean that snow and ice companies will be awash with seasonal labor when it comes time for companies to recruit good workers? Maybe. We all recognize that it's hard to find—and harder still to retain—good workers who will work all hours of the night and day in inclement weather conditions. But without a committed work force, companies cannot survive and prosper. A shortage of qualified employees is nothing new to the snow and ice management industry, so, how do you locate reliable workers in a changing economy? Unemployed bank tellers and investment bankers are probably not the answer. H-2B labor options Temporary legal foreign workers may be part of the solution. Recent changes in federal visa regulations make it possible for companies that depend on seasonal labor, even for a short period during the winter months, to take full advantage of the federal foreign H-2B temporary worker visa program. The H-2B visa program is based upon the premise that U.S. seasonal employers may hire foreign workers when they cannot find a sufficient number of U.S. workers to hire for the seasonal jobs. Now is the time to take a fresh look at H-2B and to capitalize on these new opportunities. Although the demand for H-2B workers has risen exponentially every year since 1996, only 66,000 new H-2B visas are available annually to satisfy all seasonal businesses, including hospitality, construction and landscaping. This limit does not begin to meet the demand for these reliable, hardworking legal foreign workers. As a result, employers and others in the H-2B community are working cooperatively to come up with strategies that maximize the availability of the H-2B seasonal labor supply. Employers in the snow and ice management industry could play a key role in this process—and at the same time benefit from using H-2B workers to supply at least a portion of their winter workers. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">2. H-2B Workers Often Fill Spots that American Workers Are Not Likely to Take Claims that H-2B workers take U.S. jobs away from willing American workers ignore key realities: H-2B-eligible work is usually seasonal and sometimes involves unglamorous and strenuous labor.[150] For example, the seasonal nature of hospitality and tourism-based work in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, highlights the need for a temporary labor force that logically must come from foreign sources.[151] As South Carolina’s Hospitality Association president explained, As the areas of our state that attract the most tourists have low residential populations as compared to the size of the community during peak tourism season, there are not enough local residents, or people willing to drive some distance to fill the jobs needed to help grow the state’s No. 1 industry, let alone sustain it.[152] Similarly, the general manager of a resort near Marble Falls, Texas, pointed out, “â€˜We’re in a rural area . . . . We have a tough time finding workers out here. It would be pretty near impossible to run this business’ without the H-2Bs.”[153] Furthermore, the nature of the work often turns away American workers. One employer said that he “tried hiring [Americans] from felony release programs, talking with temp agencies, paying all kinds of salaries. (People literally show up one day, take a look, and say I’m not doing this.)”[154] Likewise, Harry Phillips, who owns Russell Hall Seafood in Maryland, said of his employees, “We have American people in the offices, we hire a lot of American people, but we can’t find American people to pick crabs.”[155] 3. Evidence Has Demonstrated When Employers Cannot Access H-2B Workers, They Are Inclined to Turn to Undocumented Workers Reports that some employers bring on undocumented workers when efforts to access H-2B workers fail highlights that illegal aliens ”not H-2B workers” are most detrimental to American workers, and highlights the importance of enacting Senator Mikulski’s cap exemption provision. The National Foundation for American Policy (“NFAP”) has reported that employers who are shut out of participating in the H-2B program tend to turn to undocumented workers to fill their labor needs.[156] NFAP emphasized that “[i]t would seem naive to think that denying U.S. employers access to H-2B visa holders will result in a massive increase in hiring native-born U.S. workers. In fact, it is likely that the absence of legal temporary workers will mean more illegal immigration.”[157] In response to criticism that H-2B workers harm American workers by artificially lowering wages, NFAP has indicated it is not H-2B workers who negatively impact earnings, but illegal workers: “Reliable data show that legal workers command higher salaries than those here illegally. In other words, preventing businesses from hiring H-2B workers will logically mean more competition for natives with illegal immigrants who possess less bargaining power and earn lower wages than H-2B workers.”[158] NFAP has pointed out that employers must pay H-2B workers prevailing wages for their position the same wages to which similarly employed American workers are entitled, whereas undocumented workers, obviously, have no such express protections.[159] Reports that employers likely turn to undocumented workers to meet labor needs when they cannot access the H-2B program underscore the danger of capping the number of annually available H-2B visas at an arbitrarily low figure. NFAP’s findings unambiguously show that many illegal immigrants have been found to hold jobs that are often occupied by H-2B visa holders, and because the “occupations are generally common to illegal immigrants, this . . . demonstrate[s] that blocking the entry of additional workers on H-2B visas is more likely to increase the use of unauthorized workers.”[160] In fact, under comprehensive immigration reform proposals considered in Congress in 2007 such as the new Y-visa program, the number of legal temporary workers permitted annually would have been increased significantly to approximately half a million.[161] The nearly ten-fold increase “would not be additions to the population; they would be the same migrants who are arriving today illegally. â€˜It sounds like a large number, but that’s because we’d be counting them instead of pretending that they’re not here,’” Deborah Meyers, a senior analyst with the Migration Policy Institute, told the San Francisco Chronicle.[162] In the absence of any comprehensive panacea to the H-2B program, however, Senator Mikulski’s proposed cap exemption serves as a suitable palliative. As NFAP’s findings have demonstrated, setting the number of available H-2B visas too low encourages employers to circumvent the system. As recent years have demonstrated, each fiscal year employers immediately snap up the 66,000 available H-2B visas, leaving many other employers who have been certified by DOL as eligible to host H-2B workers with no opportunity to access the program.[163] For instance, because Senator Mikulski’s returning worker cap exemption has not yet been re-approved, USCIS announced on January 3, 2008, that all visas for the period from April to October 2008 were taken.[164] In years where the exemption was in effect, however, more employers were able to access the program. For the period from April to October 2006, USCIS accepted visa applications until April 4, 2006;[165] from April to October 2007, USCIS accepted visa applications until March 16, 2007.[166] Therefore, with some employers’ needs covered under the exemption for returning workers, the H-2B program was able to support additional employers, almost certainly helping to alleviate some of their labor needs, and thereby preventing them from turning to alternative potentially illegal sources of available labor to keep their businesses afloat. Yet, because Congress has failed to renew Senator Mikulski’s cap exemption provision for FY 2008, once again countless employers have been shut out from the H-2B program because their labor needs are still more than four months away. Many such businesses cannot survive without the foreign laborers upon whom they have become dependent, and those that can survive face certain losses. Denied congressional assistance via Senator Mikulski’s provision, and backed into a corner with seemingly no other options, it seems certain that at least some employers’ survival instincts will lead them to consider using undocumented workers. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">There may be no country on the planet more vulnerable to a massive cyberattack than the United States, where financial, transportation, telecommunications and even military operations are now deeply dependent on data networking. What's worse: U.S. security officials say the country's cyberdefenses are not up to the challenge. In part, it's due to a severe shortage of computer security specialists and engineers with the skills and knowledge necessary to do battle against would-be adversaries. The protection of U.S. computer systems essentially requires an army of cyberwarriors, but the recruitment of that force is suffering. &quot;We don't have sufficiently bright people moving into this field to support those national security objectives as we move forward in time,&quot; says James Gosler, a veteran cybersecurity specialist who has worked at the CIA, the National Security Agency and the Energy Department. If U.S. cyberdefenses are to be improved, more people like Gosler will be needed on the front lines. Gosler, 58, works at the Energy Department's Sandia National Laboratory in Albuquerque, N.M., where he focuses on ways to counter efforts to penetrate U.S. data networks. It's an ever-increasing challenge. &quot;You can have vulnerabilities in the fundamentals of the technology, you can have vulnerabilities introduced based on how that technology is implemented, and you can have vulnerabilities introduced through the artificial applications that are built on that fundamental technology,&quot; Gosler says. &quot;It takes a very skilled person to operate at that level, and we don't have enough of them.&quot; Gosler estimates there are now only 1,000 people in the entire United States with the sophisticated skills needed for the most demanding cyberdefense tasks. To meet the computer security needs of U.S. government agencies and large corporations, he says, a force of 20,000 to 30,000 similarly skilled specialists is needed. Some are currently being trained at the nonprofit SANS (SysAdmin, Audit, Network, Security) Institute outside Washington, D.C., but the demand for qualified cybersecurity specialists far exceeds the supply. &quot;You go looking for those people, but everybody else is looking for the same thousand people,&quot; says SANS Research Director Alan Paller. &quot;So they're just being pushed around from NSA to CIA to DHS to Boeing.

<span class="Underline">Two recent items reveal Moscow’s intentions. First, President Vladimir Putin has announced that he is suspending Russia’s commitment to follow the Conventional Forces in Europe treaty (CFE). This means that Russia can move tank and motorized infantry divisions to NATO’s doorstep. Second, Russian radio news broadcasters have been ordered to make 50 percent of their reporting on Russia “positive,” and that the United States is – from now on – to be described as Russia’s enemy. President Putin’s intentions are clear. The Cold War is to be renewed. America is the “main enemy” once again. It has been my contention, for many years, that this was the KGB’s intention from the outset. The collapse of Communism was a staged event. It was a repeat of Lenin’s New Economic Policy of the 1920s, in which Russia pretended to liberalize and move toward capitalism, drawing investment and technology from the West. I believe that the political process in Russia, from 1989 to the present, was guided to this end. In 1989 America’s leaders could not see the Kremlin’s intentions because intentions are invisible to the naked eye. And so America’s leaders were fooled. Now Russia and China will emerge together as “one clenched fist,” and their intention is to smash America. The Chinese, like the Russians, have carefully crafted their excuse for enmity. And like the Russians, they will blame the American side. The Chinese government, through its official organ (The People's Daily), says that U.S. Right-wing forces are determined to destroy a &quot;fragile&quot; Sino-U.S. relationship. The American side has supposedly manufactured an imaginary &quot;China threat.&quot; A typical column published by The People's Daily rhetorically asks: &quot;Why Does U.S. Preach 'China Military Threat'?&quot; According to Beijing's official organ, the Americans are determined to misread China's intentions. &quot;In the opinion of the United States,&quot; says the Daily, &quot;... it is still the traditional countries [like Russia and China] that constitute strategic threats.&quot; The People's Daily has also stated: &quot;U.S. Right-wing forces ... have all along clung to the Cold War mentality and held fast to the principle of containment in their policy toward China.&quot; The People's Daily bitterly complains that the Americans oppose Chinese military expansion in Asia. Psychologically, the outrage expressed by Beijing inadvertently reveals the malevolence of China's leaders. After all, why would The People's Daily express outrage at U.S. opposition to Chinese military expansion? Only a would-be aggressor feels thwarted by the collective security arrangements of neighboring countries. In fact, if we look at recent history we find that China has sent its armies against at least five neighboring countries since World War II: against Korea and the U.N. forces in 1950; against Tibet in 1950; against India in 1962; against Russia in 1969; and against Vietnam in 1979. Each instance involved a sudden, unprovoked strike against foreign forces outside China. If we examine Chinese propaganda with a psychological eye, we catch a glimpse of Beijing's evil intentions. They are not as easy to see as Moscow’s; but they are nonetheless real, and observable. Contrary to Chinese propaganda, American officials and analysts hardly agree there is a China threat. The American side prefers to believe that Marxism-Leninism is dead, that China is evolving into a &quot;normal&quot; country. The received wisdom of our time holds that peace can be established through technology transfers and trade. Wrap China in a blanket of dollars and Communist ideology will find itself smothered. On June 13, 2005, former U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell gave the keynote address at the Asia Leadership Forum in Bangkok, Thailand. He said that China's increased military spending doesn't threaten the United States. &quot;My analysis in the last four years,&quot; he explained, &quot;is that China has no such [hostile] intention. China wishes to live in peace with its neighbors and the U.S.&quot; </span><br />

ARMY OF HACKERS According to Pentagon sources, most attacks on America’s digital Achilles’ heel originate from the People’s Republic of China (PRC), making Chinese cyber operations an issue that deserves close attention. The PRC is serious about cyberspace and has made the development of cyber capabilities a top national- security priority. China’s military planners recognize that the United States’ reliance on computers is a potential strategic weakness ripe for exploitation. The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has reportedly incorporated cyber warfare tactics into military exercises and created schools that specialize in it. The Chinese military is also hiring top computer-science graduates to develop its cyber warfare capabilities, literally creating an army of hackers. According to an annual report of the congressionally mandated U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission (USCC): “The Chinese realize that they cannot win a traditional war against the U.S. and are seeking unorthodox ways to defeat the U.S. in any such conflict ... while building up their military power to eventually match or exceed U.S. military capabilities in East Asia.” China’s plan is to develop asymmetrical warfare weapons, including so-called “assassin’s mace weapons” that will allow the PRC to balance America’s existing military superiority in Asia. These weapons include cyber tools for use across the electromagnetic domain. According to the USCC, the PLA’s cyber warfare hit list is expansive, including “forward-based command, control, communications, computers and intelligence (C4I) nodes, airbases, aircraft carriers, and sea- and space-based command-and-control platforms.” Describing what could be called a new “arms” race — this time in cyberspace — a Pentagon assessment states that China’s military regards offensive computer operations as “critical to seize the initiative” in the first stage of a conflict. Beginning in 2003, Chinese cyber reconnaissance has become so common in the Defense Department computer networks that the Pentagon created a program, which became known as “Titan Rain,” to collect data and work the problem. Industrial espionage against government and private defense research, development and production efforts is also a priority for Chinese cyber spies, cutting costs and time in support of Beijing’s massive effort to build up its military and develop a world-class defense industry. It is not just the U.S. the Chinese have in their cyber sights. Over the past year, the United Kingdom, France and Germany have pointed an accusatory finger at China for attempting to infiltrate — or successfully penetrating — their diplomatic or defense establishment’s computer networks. Beijing is also looking for cyber dominance over other key potential regional rivals, such as New Delhi, Moscow, Seoul, Tokyo and cross-strait rival Taipei. China’s increasing aggressiveness and ability to infiltrate the computer networks of key countries is setting off alarms across the security establishment, and rightfully so. UNRULY RUSSIA Russia is believed to be developing significant cyberspace capabilities, too. Indeed, in April 2007, a massive cyber attack on the tiny Baltic state of Estonia by Russian hackers demonstrated how potentially catastrophic a pre-emptive digital strike could be on a developed nation. Pro-Russian hackers, some likely associated with the government, attacked numerous Web sites in neighboring Estonia — one of the world’s most wired countries — to protest the controversial removal of a Soviet war memorial located in the capital, Tallinn. The hackers brought down government and other Web sites, including the office of the president, the parliament, political parties, banks, news organizations and communications firms, using denial-of- service attacks, in which a server is bombarded with so many bogus requests for information that it overloads and crashes. Some of the attacks came from botnets — chains of perhaps thousands of zombie computers that have been hijacked by the malicious code of cyber pirates and linked together to take part in raids, often generating large volumes of spam, with or without their owners’ knowledge. Interestingly, a number of Estonian commentators wondered whether their defense ministry should have called on NATO to invoke Article V’s collective defense provision. An interesting point, but for the moment, NATO does not seem to view cyber attacks as a military action. Estonia has not been the only victim of an alleged Russian cyber attack. Moonlight Maze is the name given to series of coordinated attacks on Pentagon computers going back to the 1990s that may have originated in Russia, possibly compromising sensitive national security data. The Russians see cyber dominance as central to warfare. At a recent conference, a senior Russian general said victory in future conflicts will be decided by suppressing the opponent’s military and state institutions through information technologies. But it is not only major powers that are using cyberspace to advance their political-military objectives. Terrorists are all over the Internet, too. They use the Web to recruit, communicate, share information (such as bomb-making), relay threats, seek publicity for their cause, spread propaganda or gather publicly available information for target development. Terrorists also effectively use the Internet for fundraising — from both witting and unwitting donors. Terrorists, like cyber criminals, will use Web scams such as phishing to obtain private information such as passwords, while acting as a legitimate entity, to line their pockets. The Internet offers terrorists a multitude of advantages in waging their unconventional warfare: mobility, flexibility (if hacked or shut down by an Internet service provider), world-wide coverage with huge potential audiences and high-speed communications. Some Islamist hackers have promoted the notion of carrying out electronic jihad against infidel civilian infrastructure, economic and military targets. Serious attacks in which cyber terrorists take innocent lives via the Web in an effort to advance their cause may become reality in the future. In testimony to Congress in March 2007, Gen. James Cartwright, commander of U.S. Strategic Command, said: “America is under widespread attack in cyberspace. ... [T]he magnitude of cost, in terms of real dollars dedicated to defensive measures, lost intellectual capital and fraud, cannot be overestimated, making these attacks a matter of great national interest. Unlike the air, land and sea domains, we lack dominance in cyberspace and could grow increasingly vulnerable if we do not fundamentally change how we view this battle space.” State-sponsored and terrorist cyberspace efforts provide a cautionary tale to U.S. and other policymakers. Although many governments have devoted significant resources to cyber security, recent intrusions clearly demonstrate cyberspace vulnerabilities. A digital Pearl Harbor is by no means a certainty. But cyberspace is increasingly important to American national security — and complementary to the broad spectrum of modern warfare. The time to take heed of this challenge is now.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">It is no secret that modern warfare is increasingly dependent on advanced computers—and no country’s armed forces are more reliant on the digital age for information superiority than those of the U.S. This is both the American military’s greatest strength— and potentially its greatest weakness. Today, the Pentagon uses more than 5 million computers on 100,000 networks at as many as 1,500 sites in at least 65 countries worldwide. Not surprisingly, potential adversaries have taken note of America’s slavish dependence on information technology. The Defense Department suffers tens of thousands of computer network attacks annually. Although the department is understandably cautious about revealing the success of these attacks, some of the cyber assaults allegedly reduced the military’s operational capabilities. The Pentagon reportedly logged more than 79,000 attempted intrusions in 2005 — the most recent publicly available data. About 1,300 of the attacks supposedly were successful, including the reported penetration of computers linked to the Army’s 101st and 82nd Airborne and 4th Infantry divisions. Foreign cyberspace operations are a threat that is here and now — and cannot be ignored. Cyberspace operations, which include computer network attack, exploitation and defense, are not a new national security challenge. Cyber warfare was all the rage in the late 1990s but has faded in importance since 9/11, not surprisingly, in comparison to the threat of terrorism and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Cyber operations appeal to many state and nonstate actors, including terrorists, because they can be low-cost, low-risk and highly effective, and provide plausible deniability for the attacker, who can route operations through any number of surrogate servers across the Web en route to its target. Talk about “low-DNA” operations. Malicious code can launch viruses, crash networks, corrupt data, collect intelligence, spread misinformation, and interfere with vital friendly military and intelligence operations, including command, control, communications, navigation and logistics. In essence, if it is wired to the Web, it is potentially vulnerable. According to McAfee, an Internet security company, about 120 countries are involved in developing the ability to use the Internet as a weapon, not only against government networks, but also against soft targets such as financial markets and even critical civilian infrastructure. Although it is impossible to say how many raids go undetected, cyber attacks have grown increasingly sophisticated. The threat has grown from the work of curious hackers to premeditated government-sponsored operations that embrace a variety of security-related purposes.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">China's suspected role in much industrial espionage shouldn't drive U.S. decision making on cybersecurity, Wade said. &quot;I wouldn't get too hung up on where the threat comes from,&quot; he told a questioner. Much of the same technology to guard against cyberattacks is useful to prevent &quot;self- inflicted wounds&quot; by employees and software bugs. Minihan told another questioner that foreign adversaries already have a &quot;persistent presence&quot; in government systems, but that adversaries are limited by their ability to process all the information held by the government in exposed systems. The &quot;'gotcha' tip of the iceberg&quot; -- embarrassing breaches -- must not be the focus of agencies and cybersecurity providers, because the rest of the iceberg can be addressed with &quot;building codes and standards,&quot; Minihan said. Asked about an open letter to the White House from several security CEOs that called for more federal cybersecurity R&amp;D, Security Innovation Network founder Robert Rodriguez blamed the R&amp;D shortage partly on immigration rules. Some of the most innovative entrepreneurs in security have left the U.S. because of an H-1B visa shortage, he said. Wade said the National Science Foundation is promoting &quot;leap- ahead technology&quot; through sponsored conferences on both coasts to bring together academic researchers, and Defense is sponsoring similar gatherings. &quot;There's a substantial amount of money that's going to be thrown at this problem,&quot; but entrepreneurs must be ready to pitch a &quot;quantum leap&quot; in cybersecurity, not a marginally better product, Russell said. Any system can be hacked, so the U.S. needs a competitive advantage in advanced technology to stay ahead of threats, he said. -- Greg Piper </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Many practitioners assume that the H-2B has to be for lower-skilled positions and thus positions that are not appropriate for H-1B professions. That is not the case. As long as the requisite 'temporariness' of the position can be established, and as long as a shortage of qualified U.S. workers can be established through the requisite recruitment, H-2B becomes an option. However, it is important to emphasize that the requisite temporariness can be difficult to prove. The position must qualify as seasonal, peak-load, intermittent or one-time occurrence. For example, if it can be proven that the foreign national is needed to work on a specific project with a specific end date, the H-2B may be a viable option. However, unlike the other options, the H-2B has quota problems of its own, although there are certainly times of the year when the H-1B quota is exhausted and the H-2B may still be available.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">The advent of Internet attacks — especially those suspected of being directed by nations, not hackers — has given rise to a new term inside the Pentagon and the National Security Agency: “hybrid warfare.” It describes a conflict in which attacks through the Internet can be launched as a warning shot — or to pave the way for a traditional attack. Early hints of this new kind of warfare emerged in the confrontation between Russia and Estonia in April 2007. Clandestine groups — it was never determined if they had links to the Russian government — commandeered computers around the globe and directed a fire hose of data at Estonia’s banking system and its government Web sites. The computer screens of Estonians trying to do business with the government online were frozen, if they got anything at all. It was annoying, but by the standards of cyberwar, it was child’s play. In August 2008, when Russia invaded Georgia, the cyberattacks grew more widespread. Georgians were denied online access to news, cash and air tickets. The Georgian government had to move its Internet activity to servers in Ukraine when its own servers locked up, but the attacks did no permanent damage.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">THE DOOMSDAY SCENARIO THE high-intensity scenario postulates a cross-strait war escalating into a full-scale war between the US and China. If Washington were to conclude that splitting China would better serve its national interests, then a full-scale war becomes unavoidable. Conflict on such a scale would embroil other countries far and near and -- horror of horrors -- raise the possibility of a nuclear war. Beijing has already told the US and Japan privately that it considers any country providing bases and logistics support to any US forces attacking China as belligerent parties open to its retaliation. In the region, this means South Korea, Japan, the Philippines and, to a lesser extent, Singapore. If China were to retaliate, east Asia will be set on fire. And the conflagration may not end there as opportunistic powers elsewhere may try to overturn the existing world order. With the US distracted, Russia may seek to redefine Europe's political landscape. The balance of power in the Middle East may be similarly upset by the likes of Iraq. In south Asia, hostilities between India and Pakistan, each armed with its own nuclear arsenal, could enter a new and dangerous phase. Will a full-scale Sino-US war lead to a nuclear war? According to General Matthew Ridgeway, commander of the US Eighth Army which fought against the Chinese in the Korean War, the US had at the time thought of using nuclear weapons against China to save the US from military defeat. In his book The Korean War, a personal account of the military and political aspects of the conflict and its implications on future US foreign policy, Gen Ridgeway said that US was confronted with two choices in Korea -- truce or a broadened war, which could have led to the use of nuclear weapons. If the US had to resort to nuclear weaponry to defeat China long before the latter acquired a similar capability, there is little hope of winning a war against China 50 years later, short of using nuclear weapons. The US estimates that China possesses about 20 nuclear warheads that can destroy major American cities. Beijing also seems prepared to go for the nuclear option. A Chinese military officer disclosed recently that Beijing was considering a review of its &quot;non first use&quot; principle regarding nuclear weapons. Major-General Pan Zhangqiang, president of the military-funded Institute for Strategic Studies, told a gathering at the Woodrow Wilson International Centre for Scholars in Washington that although the government still abided by that principle, there were strong pressures from the military to drop it. He said military leaders considered the use of nuclear weapons mandatory if the country risked dismemberment as a result of foreign intervention. Gen Ridgeway said that should that come to pass, we would see the destruction of civilisation. There would be no victors in such a war. While the prospect of a nuclear Armaggedon over Taiwan might seem inconceivable, it cannot be ruled out entirely, for China puts sovereignty above everything else.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">A much greater existential risk emerged with the build-up of nuclear arsenals in the US and the USSR. An all-out nuclear war was a possibility with both a substantial probability and with consequences that might have been persistent enough to qualify as global and terminal. There was a real worry among those best acquainted with the information available at the time that a nuclear Armageddon would occur and that it might annihilate our species or permanently destroy human civilization. Russia and the US retain large nuclear arsenals that could be used in a future confrontation, either accidentally or deliberately. There is also a risk that other states may one day build up large nuclear arsenals. Note however that a smaller nuclear exchange, between India and Pakistan for instance, is not an existential risk, since it would not destroy or thwart humankind’s potential permanently. </span><br />

<br />
<span class="Underline">Our grid is crumbling with no sign of rebound – the perception is key to get it restarted</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Harwood ’10 (Matthew, quoting Dr. Stephen Flynn, president of the Center for National Policy, January 15, 2010. “Crumbling Infrastructure a National Security Concern, Experts Say.”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.securitymanagement.com/news/crumbling-infrastructure-a-national-security-concern-experts-say-006649" rel="nofollow">http://www.securitymanagement.com/news/crumbling-infrastructure-a-national-security-concern-experts-say-006649</a>)</span><br />
<span class="Underline">The Northeast Blackout of 2003; the breached levees of New Orleans in 2005; and the Minneapolis I-35W bridge collapse of 2007 are all perilous signals that U.S. infrastructure is crumbling and jeopardizing our national security, a prominent homeland security expert warned Thursday. Yet despite these warning signs, Americans don’t want to invest in its maintenance, let alone spend money to upgrade it, said Dr. Stephen Flynn, the new president of the Center for National Policy (CNP), a bipartisan national security think tank that hosted the discussion about U.S. crumbling infrastructure. “We are a generation that is arguably like grandkids who have inherited a mansion and most of us decide we’re not going to do the upkeep,” he said. “People drive by and say ‘nice house,’ but the plumbing’s gone to hell, the wiring’s shot.” Flynn was joined by writer James Fallows, national correspondent for The Atlantic Monthly, whose January cover article for the magazine explores how to keep the United States the envy of the world after the financial crisis. National Public Radio’s national security correspondent Tom Gjelten moderated the event. The discussion was made timelier by the devastation wrought by a catastrophic earthquake in Haiti on Tuesday, a society whose infrastructure is “broken,” according to Flynn. While no one tried to compare U.S. infrastructure to Haiti’s, the message was clear: no part of America ever wants to approximate that level of helplessness if disaster strikes. The discussion centered around how to convince the American public, representatives in Congress, and the national security community that investing and upgrading our infrastructure is not only good national security policy, it’s also good economic and social policy. But there's a prevailing pessimism infrastructure advocates must overcome if the argument is going to gain traction with the American public, Flynn said. The first perception is that United States cannot afford it. Second, Americans do not believe in the political process to complete massive projects. Rather they note “bridges to nowhere,” emblematic of Congress' corruption. Finally, Flynn said, Americans no longer have the faith in themselves to build an infrastructure necessary for 21st century America to retain its economic power. And even if proponents can get over those hurdles, they still have to sell why the U.S. should spend scarce resources on infrastructure and not other things. Fortunately there’s a national security argument from the past for infrastructure advocates, said Flynn. During the presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower, the former general explained to the American public that the country needed to build the interstate highway system, which he called the &quot;National Defense Highway System,&quot; to move resources quickly around the country and possibly evacuate cities if the Cold War ever turned hot. Fallows similarly argued that the only way to gain the American public’s attention is to evoke national security and emergency. “We have tremendous rebound capacity, but in terms of directing public attention, we seem to have only the military as a legitimate vehicle,” he said, adding “We seem to need an electric cattle prod of an emergency to do things and that’s a cause for worry.” But that’s a tricky proposition, both Flynn and Fallows observed, noting the hysteria following the botched terrorist attack on Christmas Day. Politicians and government can’t overreact, Flynn explains, because that’s what the terrorists hope to achieve. “If we say that the unofficial doctrine of this country is we will overreact every time something goes wrong, you’re actually motivating our adversaries to say ‘Let’s keep trying,’” he said. And because the United States is the world’s dominant military power, the only real way for enemies to attack the country is through its infrastructure, including cyberspace, making infrastructure resilience critical. “If [an attack] does happen, and very little of consequence happens, we get a national security benefit,” Flynn argued. “There’s a deterrent value to investing in this.” But if on the other hand adversaries can repeatedly attack a brittle critical infrastructure, Americans will lose faith in the everyday services and networks that are the source of U.S. prosperity and see them as a weaknesses.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">Williams ‘9</span><br />
<span class="Underline">[Mark. Staff Writer: AP Newswire. “US on Verge of Grand Scale Blackout” The Associated Press, 10/14/09. Lexis]</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Five years after the worst blackout in North American history, the country’s largest utilities say the U.S. power system faces the prospect of even bigger and more damaging outages. The specific flaws that led to 50 million people losing power in 2003 have largely been addressed, they say, but even bigger problems loom. Excess generating capacity in the system is shrinking, for example, and power-plant construction has slowed as costs to build and operate plants have soared. At the same time, it is estimated that electricity use will increase 29 percent between 2006 to 2030 — much of it driven by residential growth, according to a government report issued in June. “I’m really not a ‘Chicken Little’ player, but I worry that no one seems to be focusing in on this,” said Michael Morris, chairman, president and chief executive of American Electric Power, which runs the nation’s largest electricity transmission system. Morris said massive outages this year in South Africa, which forced gold, diamond and platinum mines to stop production for five days, should serve as a warning to the United States. Industry experts back Morris and say there is even more resistance to building new plants because of the debate over climate change and opposition to new transmission lines. The blocking of two coal-fired plants in Kansas is one example of the resistance. “The level of excess capacity has shrunk … to a level barely within the planning toleration of the industry,” said Marc Chupka, with the Brattle Group, an energy consultant. The blackout five years ago shut off power to vast swaths of the Northeast and Midwest for as much as four days. Rolling blackouts continued in Ontario for a week. The outages caused as much as $10 billion in damages to the U.S. economy. FirstEnergy Corp. of Akron, Ohio, which got the blame for the spread of the outages, has worked to shore up its transmission system. But the larger issues of the country’s total generating ability and the overall health and capacity of the transmission grid remain a problem, the experts say. Rick Sergel, president of the North American Electric Reliability Corp., the agency that oversees the nation’s power grid, said, “We’re to the point where we need every possible resource: renewables, demand response and energy efficiency, nuclear, clean coal — you name it, we need it. And we especially need the transmission lines that will bring the power generated by these new resources to consumers.” Construction of coal-fired generating plants has almost stopped, and new nuclear plants are years away, if they are approved at all, said Arshad Mansoor, vice president of power delivery and use for the Electric Power Research Institute. Better efficiency will go only so far, he said. Morris, of American Electric Power, sees a potentially dire situation ahead, including the sort of power rationing that occurred in South Africa. “It would ruin the economy,” Morris said.</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Low skilled workers are key restore the crippled infrastructure, but Americans don’t want to do this work anymore</span><br />

<span class="Underline">A cultural shift has taken place in America that's tragically made the skilled worker a thing of the past. Our media has glorified celebrity at the expense of our nation's basic needs, and America will reap the whirlwind within the next two decades. At stake is nothing less than our long-term economic vitality and national security. Let's start with infrastructure — bridges, roads, water and sewer systems. America is dangerously close to failures that will result in loss of life and are already resulting in loss of economic competitiveness. In many cases, currently funded infrastructure projects cannot move forward due to lack of skilled workers. For example, a national shortage of 500,000 welders has resulted in delays or cancellations of many key projects. Expand that out over the entire economy and we have a massive crisis on our hands. By 2012, there will be a 3 million skilled worker shortfall in our nation, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. In Oklahoma, which has had solid energy and manufacturing industries, top companies have difficulty finding adequate skilled workers to fill positions. The average age of American skilled workers is 55, which means the bulk of our skilled worker base will retire in the next decade. There are not enough skilled workers to replace them and maintain the nation's competitive global position. In my interviews with employers across the nation, I hear the same story: Business owners are desperate for skilled workers. Many are reaching out to local schools to attract young people into the trades. Despite the offer of good pay and benefits, the noble skills that involve working with your hands and mind don't hold the same appeal as they did in decades past. Some businesses are considering moving their operations (and jobs) overseas. We're experiencing the loss of the once-vaunted edge that America enjoyed. From aviation to energy, our national security is at risk. In order to maintain the world's most sophisticated military, we must produce systems, parts and hardware in America. Without domestic manufacturing operations, critical component work has been moved offshore as a stop-gap measure. The lens through which I view the world is simple: The manual arts always take precedence over the fine arts. Remember, someone had to build the ceiling before Michelangelo could go to work. Negative images of skilled workers — what I call &quot;essential workers&quot; — pervade our culture. The truth is, high-profile athletes and entertainers are non-essential. If all the celebrities like me disappeared overnight, it would be sad, but the world would continue with little disruption. But if plumbers, electricians, welders, carpenters, lathe operators, truck drivers and other &quot;essentials&quot; disappeared, our country would grind to a halt. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">H-2B workers are key to take their place – their labor markets arguments are false</span><br />

<span class="Underline">The H-2B program was designed to legally and temporarily supply immigrant workers to American industries that struggle with labor shortages, especially those in the service areas (hotels, restaurants) as well as seasonal businesses. So now, with a lagging economy and unemployment rates reaching record highs, the need for the program no longer exists, right? Wrong. However, many opponents of the program—which is no stranger to fierce criticism—believe that now is the perfect time to eliminate H- 2B. These people feel that if there is a demand for labor, whether that labor be temporary or permanent, it should be filled by out-of-work Americans. At first glance, this position does make sense. It would provide those seeking employment with jobs, while simultaneously meeting the seasonal labor requirements of a number of industries. However, many landscape contractors are finding that a disconnect exists between unemployment and seasonal labor. “When we ran our ad for H-2B this year, out of 150 labor jobs that I advertised for, I think I got responses from three interested parties,” says Maria Candler of James River Grounds Management, Inc., Glenn Allen, Virginia. “To be fair, that is a huge increase from the previous season’s number. Last year, exactly zero people responded to our ad and when push came to shove, the three people who responded to the ad this year didn’t even bother to show up for an interview.” It’s important to remember that the H-2B program is intended not only to mitigate labor shortages, but to also fill positions that American workers choose not to. It’s not that Americans don’t want to work. Everyone knows that’s not the case. But even in these economically tumultuous times, American workers don’t want to fill H-2B positions. More often than not, the wages earned by those participating in the H-2B program are not competitive with the income provided by unemployment insurance. Opponents of the program are quick to offer a simple fix to this problem: simply raise wages. It is true that the more you are willing to pay, the more people will be willing to work. However, this theory is flawed for a number of reasons. Mainly, it makes the cost of doing business prohibitive. “Economists and pundits who recommend raising the hourly rate until American workers become interested in taking these positions have probably never had to run a business,” says Tom Delaney, director of government affairs for the Professional Landcare Network, Herndon, Virginia. “If employers keep raising their wages, they’ll soon price themselves out of business.” Many contractors share Delaney’s point of view. “I think every owner in the landscape contracting business would like to be able to pay their workers more,” says Steve Miserocchi, president and owner of Cara-Tera Landscape and Statuary in Kirkwood, Missouri. “It’s hard work and it’s really not as simple as a lot of people think it is. But unfortunately, people are only willing to pay so much to have their shrubs trimmed or their lawn fertilized. I just can’t afford to pay my guys $30 an hour, because the marketplace wouldn’t support it. Paying those kinds of wages is not a reality for me or most other owners in this industry. It would most likely put us out of business.” It’s also worth noting that most people who are out of work tend to look for jobs within their current industry. It is unlikely that an unemployed blue collar worker is going to make the jump to landscape maintenance. But even those who cannot continue to work in their current field are unlikely to turn to seasonal labor. It is becoming increasingly common for states to train their unemployed workers for employment in fields that can provide sustainable job opportunities. “State employment agencies are making an effort to retrain unemployed workers in fields where people can enjoy new careers, like medical records keeping, for example,” says Delaney. “These workers are not being trained to be laborers on landscaping crews.” </span><br />

<span class="Underline">America’s top intelligence official told lawmakers on Tuesday that Al Qaeda and its affiliates had made it a high priority to attempt a large-scale attack on American soil within the next six months. The assessment by Dennis C. Blair, the director of national intelligence, was much starker than his view last year, when he emphasized the considerable progress in the campaign to debilitate Al Qaeda and said that the global economic meltdown, rather than the prospect of a major terrorist attack, was the “primary near-term security concern of the United States.” At Tuesday’s hearing, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California and chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, asked Mr. Blair to assess the possibility of an attempted attack in the United States in the next three to six months. He replied, “The priority is certain, I would say” — a response that was reaffirmed by the top officials of the C.I.A. and the F.B.I. Citing a recent wave of terrorist plots, including the failed Dec. 25 attempt to blow up an airliner as it approached Detroit, Mr. Blair and other intelligence officials told a Senate panel that Al Qaeda had adjusted its tactics to more effectively strike American targets domestically and abroad. “The biggest threat is not so much that we face an attack like 9/11,” said Leon E. Panetta, the C.I.A. director. “It is that Al Qaeda is adapting its methods in ways that oftentimes make it difficult to detect.” As the C.I.A. continues its drone attacks aimed at Qaeda operatives in Pakistan, the officials also said that the network’s splinter groups in Yemen and Somalia were taking on more importance. But Mr. Blair began his annual threat testimony before Congress by saying that the threat of a crippling attack on telecommunications and other computer networks was growing, as an increasingly sophisticated group of enemies had “severely threatened” the sometimes fragile systems undergirding the country’s information infrastructure. “Malicious cyberactivity is occurring on an unprecedented scale with extraordinary sophistication,” he told the committee. His emphasis on the threat points up the growing concerns among American intelligence officials about the potentially devastating results of a coordinated attack on the nation’s technology apparatus, sometimes called a “cyber-Pearl Harbor.” He said that the surge in cyberattacks, including the penetration of Google’s servers from inside China, was a “wake-up call” for those who dismissed the threat of computer warfare. “Sensitive information is stolen daily from both government and private-sector networks, undermining confidence in our information systems, and in the very information these systems were intended to convey,” Mr. Blair said. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Al-Qaeda sources announced that they are responsible for the recent power blackout in America. One more lie to add to a thousand tall tales spun by hidden terrorists. In fact, the recent power blackout actually demonstrated that the electric computer network operated correctly. The blackout began when a critical main line went down, leaving the rest of the network to carry the electrical load. The network noted that the load was too much to carry and began to shut itself down. The so-called &quot;domino&quot; effect began as each segment of the grid detected an overload and shut down, including 10 nuclear power plants that &quot;scrammed&quot; (shut down) automatically. If hackers had had control of the network, they would have overridden the shutdown commands. The override would have caused physical damage to the network, burning out transformers and switching stations as they tried to carry the excess power. The result would have been millions of dollars in damages, and weeks without electrical power for millions of Americans. Instead, the power companies were able to take care of the specific overload and re-establish electrical power within hours. The power blackout may have been an inept hack attack but it is doubtful – simply because there was little physical damage to the electrical grid. One reason why I doubt Al-Qaeda’s claim is because the 10 nuclear power plants located in the blackout area all shut down per pre-programmed safety procedures. If hackers had been able to penetrate the computer networks, they might have been able to override the automatic &quot;scram&quot; sequences inside the nuclear power plants. This frightful scenario ends with an atomic meltdown. Air Force Hackers Succeed In comparison, the U.S. Air Force recently conducted a successful simulated attack against the American power grid. Hackers from the South Carolina-based cyber war squadron were able to penetrate the fragile power grid on the West Coast. The Air Force hackers could have brought down the electrical grid from Seattle to San Diego. Computer security is something that does not come naturally to government or business authorities. It is viewed as an expense of doing business, something that must be kept to a bare minimum. I once served as security adviser for Virginia Government Internet Committee and co-wrote the information security requirements for the state in its final report to the Virginia Commonwealth Legislature. The report was requested by Gov. Doug Wilder (D) and accepted by Gov. George Allen (R). I spent months in meetings and hundreds of hours compiling evidence for the state to set up a strong information security policy. For the most part the rest of the committee ignored the evidence and the recommendations. Until one day when a group of system administrators from another state came to show off their brand new computer network. Many of the members were fascinated by the performance of this computer network – until I managed to squeeze in a single question about the security of their system. &quot;Oh,&quot; one of the administrators replied, &quot;we have not had any real problems with security except when a hacker used our system to get into a nuclear power plant.&quot; At that moment you could have heard a pin drop. Every talking head in the room fell silent and nearly a hundred eyes focused on the now nervous computer administrator. &quot;How did you find the hacker?&quot; I asked, pressing my point. &quot;We didn’t. The nuclear power plant contacted us and we shut down the open connections,&quot; she replied. Suddenly computer security became the hot topic. The potential use of a government-owned computer network to hack into a nuclear power plant frightened every politician and bureaucrat in the room. In the end, the committee unanimously agreed to accept all of my security proposals. Entire Networks Are Vulnerable It may come as a shocking surprise, but many of the U.S. electrical power grid computer networks are unprotected. You actually have more security sending your credit card number over the Internet than the control commands that operate your electric power do.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">And if you detonate a single nuclear weapon in the upper atmosphere you will produce an electric magnetic pulse, or EMP. One nuclear weapon detonated in near space would therefore melt down the entire electronic communications network of the United States. This would of course ruin the U.S. economy and utterly disrupt society across the country. But it would have even more grave consequences. There are 103 nuclear power plants across the United States. They all rely on external electricity supply that powers their water-coolant systems. If these were all knocked out, you would run the risk of more than 100 Chernobyl-scale nuclear core meltdowns across the United States. All the power plants have their own back-up generators, of course, but they would all need time crank up and too often their testing and maintenance has been neglected because they so seldom, if ever, have had to be used in the past, and some of them don't work when they're supposed to. Therefore there would indeed be a real risk of many Chernobyls all over the place. Thus a single EMP detonation in space aimed against U.S. military space-based assets could produce a truly cataclysmic outcome, and it would be very easy to do. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">A secure grid is a reliable grid, and the reliability of the electric power supply – defined as uninterrupted power without “surges” or “sags” – is essential to the digital devices that are essential to our lives. Even momentary surges, sags, or power interruptions can disable these digital devices. Smart grid monitoring and automated response elements can anticipate and head off these interruptions in the quality of the power supply, substantially increasing the reliability of the grid. Moreover, these monitoring and control devices, combined with distributed power generation and networked distribution lines, will allow grid supervisors to re-route power in response to weather and accident events that would normally produce extended power outages. 2.2.2 Security as Robustness to Hostile Intent The vulnerability of the existing grid to cyberspies and cyberterrorism has drawn increased attention, especially with reports of increased intrusions into the grid over the past several years (Gorman 2009). The current grid is considered particularly vulnerable due to a current grid that has been cobbled together with outdated security technology (Hendricks 2009). Smart grid planners envision integrating cyber security features with digital monitoring and automatic control devices, making the smart grid more resistant to remote “cyber attacks.” In addition, distributed power generation and networked power distribution is expected to make the grid far more robust to hostile physical and cyber attacks on the electricity infrastructure.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">The terrorist act can reactivate atavistic defense mechanisms which drive us to gather around clan chieftans. Nationalistic sentiment re-awakens, setting up an implacable frontier which divides &quot;us&quot; from &quot;them,&quot; each group solidifying its cohesion in a rising hate/fear of the other group. (Remember Yugoslavia?) To be sure, the allies are trying for the moment to avoid the language of polarization, insisting that &quot;this is not a war,&quot; that it is &quot;not against Islam,&quot; &quot;civilians will not be targeted.&quot; But the word &quot;war&quot; was pronounced, a word heavy with significance which forces the issue of partisanship. And it must be understood that the sentiment of partisanship, of belonging to the group, is one of the strongest of human emotions. Because the enemy has been named in the media (Islam), the situation has become emotionally volatile. Another spectacular attack, coming on top of an economic recession could easily radicalize the latent attitudes of the United States, and also of Europe, where racial prejudices are especially close to the surface and ask no more than a pretext to burst out. This is the Sarajevo syndrome: an isolated act of madness becomes the pretext for a war that is just as mad, made of ancestral rancor, measureless ambitions, and armies in search of a war. We should not be fooled by our expressions of good will and charity toward the innocent victims of this or other distant wars. It is our own comfortable circumstances which permit us these benevolent sentiments. If conditions change so that poverty and famine put the fear of starvation in our guts, the human beast will reappear. And if epidemic becomes a clear and present danger, fear will unleash hatred in the land of the free, flinging missiles indiscriminately toward any supposed havens of the unseen enemy. And on the other side, no matter how profoundly complex and differentiated Islamic nations and tribes may be, they will be forced to behave as one clan by those who see advantage in radicalizing the conflict, whether they be themselves merchants or terrorists.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">“The US has run out of bullets,” said Nouriel Roubini, professor at New York University, and one of a caste of luminaries with grim forecasts at the annual Ambrosetti conference on Lake Como. “More quantitative easing (bond purchases) by the Federal Reserve is not going to make any difference. Treasury yields are already down to 2.5pc yet credit spreads are widening again. Monetary policy can boost liquidity but it can’t deal with solvency problems,” he told Europe’s policy elite. Dr Roubini said the US growth rate was likely to fall below 1pc in the second half of the year, despite the biggest stimulus in history: a cut in interest rates from 5pc to zero, a budget deficit of 10pc of GDP, and $3 trillion to shore up the financial system. The anaemic pace compares with rates of 4pc-6pc at this stage of recovery in normal post-war recoveries. “We have reached stall speed. Any shock at this point can tip you back into recession. With interbank spreads rising, you can get a vicious circle like 2008-2009,” he said, describing a self-feeding process as the real economy and the credit system hurt each other. “There is a 40pc chance of double-dip recession in the US, and worse in Japan. Even if it is not technically a recession it will feel like it,” he added. Hans-Werner Sinn, head of Germany’s IFO Institute, said the US would have to purge its debt excesses the hard way. “The bitter truth is that there is no way out of this with monetary and fiscal policy. They will just have to see their living standards go down. I see a decade of difficulties for the US,” he said.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">Double-dip recession now and will lead to high unemployment - </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Elwell 12/28/10 (Craig, Specialist in Macroeconomic Policy , December 28, “Double-Dip Recession: Previous Experience and Current Prospect”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://economic-legislation.blogspot.com/2010/12/double-dip-recession-previous.html" rel="nofollow">http://economic-legislation.blogspot.com/2010/12/double-dip-recession-previous.html</a>)</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Concerns have been expressed that the United States may be about to experience a “double-dip” recession. A double-dip or W-shaped recession occurs when the economy emerges from a recession, has a short period of growth, but then falls back into recession. This prospect raises policy questions about the current level of economic stimulus and whether added stimulus may be needed. The pace of the recovery has been below average and is decelerating, falling from a 5% to a 1.7% annual average rate of growth between the fourth quarter of 2009 and the second quarter of 2010. Other indicators, such as high unemployment, falling house prices, reduced flows of credit, and the prospect of fading fiscal stimulus, are also worrisome. Double-dip recessions are rare. There are only two modern examples of a double-dip recession for the United States: the recession of 1937-1938 and the recession of 1981-1982. They both had the common attribute of resulting from a change in economic policy. In the first case, recession was an unintended consequence of the policy change; in the second case, recession was an intended consequence. Historically, there has been what is termed a “snap back” relationship between the severity of the recession and the strength of the subsequent recovery. In other words, a sharp contraction followed by a robust recovery traces out a V-shaped pattern of growth. However, unlike earlier post-war recessions, the recent recession occurred with a financial crisis. Research suggests that a slow recovery with sustained high unemployment is the norm in the aftermath of a deep financial crisis.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">GMJ: Six to eight months ago, many economists were saying the economy would reach its nadir in summer 2009, then it would start to grow again -- or at least stop contracting so fast. Do you think that's likely? Dr. Jacobe: It's a matter of perspective. I think most economists were saying that the second half is when we'd start to see a recovery. Then things got worse, so that got modified. Now, most economists think the economy will bottom out in the second half of 2009 and begin recovery in 2010. I think given the current situation, that is the most likely scenario. But there are several reasons for concern. First, the current economic downturn started as a financial crisis led to a crisis for the overall economy. Although the financial situation seems to be improving, I'm still concerned about the flow of credit to consumers and small businesses. The evaporation of the so-called shadow banking system of securitization, increased bank capital requirements, a return to old-time underwriting standards, and increased credit losses in such sectors as commercial real estate and credit cards all suggest reduced credit availability compared to anything experienced during the past several years. Second, we are in a period of business uncertainty unparalleled since the 1930s. Business owners and managers simply have little or no &quot;visibility&quot; going forward. Consumers have changed their spending habits and businesses have stopped investing. Further, there appears to be a level of &quot;government risk&quot; that is unprecedented in the post WWII period. This may be the right time -- even a golden opportunity -- for achieving &quot;change&quot; in many major business sectors politically, but the resulting increased uncertainty could &quot;metastasize&quot; the current recession. Third, now we're in a more traditional recession. As more businesses disappear and unemployment goes up even more, there could be another pullback in spending by consumers and businesses. As you can tell, right now I'm really worried about consumer spending. In this regard, most people think of the job market as a lagging indicator, but I think employment is the key to rebuilding the consumer psychology that allows consumers to spend comfortably and on big-ticket items. I think people need to feel more secure about their jobs -- and they need to feel more secure about their personal balance sheets --&gt;</span><br />

Senators Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.) and John Warner (R-Va.) have tried once again this year to extend the returning worker provision under the H-2B visa program for five years. The $43 billion landscape industry is one of many in the United States that depends on seasonal workers to survive. Companies throughout these industries face chronic shortages of temporary seasonal workers that Congress partially relieved through the H-2B program's returning worker exemption. Unfortunately, this provision, which rewards those companies and individuals who follow the law, expired on September 30 despite widespread bipartisan support for its extension. The program proposes exempting returning seasonal workers from counting against the national cap of 66,000 people. A cap exemption was added three years ago, but the clause expired on September 30, a day before the new fiscal year. The cap exemption is typically met within the first months of the fiscal year. In the past, the cap has been met by January, leaving many lawn and landscape businesses without the workers they need for their crucial spring season. There are stringent rules on advertising these jobs to Americans, and companies must work diligently to try to fill these positions with American workers before they are opened up to guest workers. It is estimated that 2.5 American jobs are tied to each H-2B seasonal worker. &quot;It's not just companies in our industry and the communities they serve who are suffering,&quot; said Tom Delaney, PLANET's director of government affairs. &quot;The H-2B disaster also puts at risk the welfare of American workers and their families. And, as significantly, Congress' failure to act is placing in jeopardy American jobs at truck assembly and equipment manufacturing plants, not to mention other companies that support and supply our industry.&quot;</span><br />

<span class="Underline">Yet that is exactly the effect of an immigration policy that fails to recognize and meet our need for unskilled foreign labor. Mr. Camarota could not be more wrong about immigration's consequences for the economy. In fact, rather than taking jobs from Americans, immigrants grow the pie for everyone: attracting investment, making capital more productive, and filling jobs at the low end of the ladder so that increasingly educated Americans can maximize their productivity. Newcomers don't generally compete with the native-born, they complement them, to everyone's benefit. Even the 9 percent of American workers who haven't completed high school—the only ones who go head-to-head with immigrants and whose wages sometimes suffer as a result, though by no more than a few percentage points over the past twenty years—make up what they lose in wages in cheaper services. Meanwhile, immigrant entrepreneurs create jobs, and immigration allows many industries, including agriculture and food processing, to stay in the United States rather than move where labor is cheaper. Yes, many immigrants are poor, uneducated workers who pay relatively little in taxes. But that's precisely the point: even with modern technology—in some cases, because of it—we still need a significant number of low-skilled workers to keep our economy running. Surely Mr. Camarota isn't suggesting that we do the right thing when we profit from their labor but, by keeping them illegal, limit their access to services? And if anything, once they became legal residents, they would pay more of their fair share of the taxes that pay for those benefits.</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Low skilled immigration promotes growth and prevents offshoring – the newest study prove</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Cowen 10/31/10 (Tyler, is a professor of economics at George Mason University, October 30, “How Immigrants Create More Jobs”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/31/business/economy/31view.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/31/business/economy/31view.html</a>).</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Over all, it turns out that the continuing arrival of immigrants to American shores is encouraging business activity here, thereby producing more jobs, according to a new study. Its authors argue that the easier it is to find cheap immigrant labor at home, the less likely that production will relocate offshore. The study, “Immigration, Offshoring and American Jobs,” was written by two economics professors — Gianmarco I. P. Ottaviano of Bocconi University in Italy and Giovanni Peri of the University of California, Davis — along with Greg C. Wright, a Ph.D. candidate at Davis. The study notes that when companies move production offshore, they pull away not only low-wage jobs but also many related jobs, which can include high-skilled managers, tech repairmen and others. But hiring immigrants even for low-wage jobs helps keep many kinds of jobs in the United States, the authors say. In fact, when immigration is rising as a share of employment in an economic sector, offshoring tends to be falling, and vice versa, the study found. In other words, immigrants may be competing more with offshored workers than with other laborers in America. American economic sectors with much exposure to immigration fared better in employment growth than more insulated sectors, even for low-skilled labor, the authors found. It’s hard to prove cause and effect in these studies, or to measure all relevant variables precisely, but at the very least, the evidence in this study doesn’t offer much support for the popular bias against immigration, and globalization more generally. We see the job-creating benefits of trade and immigration every day, even if we don’t always recognize them. As other papers by Professor Peri have shown, low-skilled immigrants usually fill gaps in American labor markets and generally enhance domestic business prospects rather than destroy jobs; this occurs because of an important phenomenon, the presence of what are known as “complementary” workers, namely those who add value to the work of others. An immigrant will often take a job as a construction worker, a drywall installer or a taxi driver, for example, while a native-born worker may end up being promoted to supervisor. And as immigrants succeed here, they help the United States develop strong business and social networks with the rest of the world, making it easier for us to do business with India, Brazil and most other countries, again creating more jobs. For all the talk of the dangers of offshoring, there is a related trend that we might call in-shoring. Dell or Apple computers may be assembled overseas, for example, but those products aid many American businesses at home and allow them to expand here. A cheap call center in India can encourage a company to open up more branches to sell its products in the United States. Those are further examples of how some laborers can complement others; it’s not all about one group of people taking jobs from another. Job creation and destruction are so intertwined that, over all, the authors find no statistically verifiable connection between offshoring and net creation of American jobs. We’re all worried about unemployment, but the problem is usually rooted in macroeconomic conditions, not in immigration or offshoring. (According to a Pew study, the number of illegal immigrants from the Caribbean and Latin America fell 22 percent from 2007 to 2009; their departure has not had much effect on the weak United States job market.) Remember, too, that each immigrant consumes products sold here, therefore also helping to create jobs. When it comes to immigration, positive-sum thinking is too often absent in public discourse these days. Debates on immigration and labor markets reflect some common human cognitive failings — namely, that we are quicker to vilify groups of different “others” than we are to blame impersonal forces. Consider the fears that foreign competition, offshoring and immigration have destroyed large numbers of American jobs. In reality, more workers have probably been displaced by machines — as happens every time computer software eliminates a task formerly performed by a clerical worker. Yet we know that machines and computers do the economy far more good than harm and that they create more jobs than they destroy.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">Finally, you also became aware of the following facts: Federal government expenditures are growing far faster than the economy, and thus the government is becoming a larger and larger share of gross domestic product. Obviously, this cannot continue forever because eventually the government would totally drive out the private sector. The entitlement programs (i.e., Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, etc.) all continue to grow faster than the economy, and they will take more than 100 percent of all federal tax revenue this year, requiring that virtually all of the other government spending programs, including defense and interest payments on the debt, be funded by more borrowing. You are also aware that the government cannot tax its way out of the deficit situation, because increasing income tax rates on the upper income people will both slow the economy and cause them to find legal or illegal ways to avoid the tax increase, and the politicians have pledged to not increase taxes on those making less than $250,000, which includes all but a very few Americans. Even if the politicians break their pledges not to increase taxes, they still cannot solve the deficit problem as long as they refuse to cut back on the growth in Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid — because any new tax revenue will be quickly absorbed by the growth in spending. The best that any tax increase could do is delay the explosion of the debt bomb by, perhaps, a couple of years while further weakening the economy and job growth. Now suppose you are not an individual bondholder but the Chinese government official responsible for the Chinese economy, and you know your government holds about $1 trillion in U.S. government securities. You have watched Congress and the administration become less and less fiscally responsible — more spending, more taxes, and more debt. Then suddenly the administration puts punitive tariffs on your tire manufacturers while at the same time refuses to approve the trade treaties with Colombia, Panama and South Korea that have been negotiated. You understand that these foolish and destructive actions by U.S. government officials indicate it does not understand the importance of free trade in fostering economic growth, and seem to be intent on replicating the mistakes of the 1930s. The Chinese are not stupid, and they have been vocal in saying they are concerned that U.S. policies will lead to a further fall in the dollar and higher rates of inflation, both of which undermine the value of their investment in U.S. government securities. The Chinese are now trying to diversify their holdings — and their recent activity in buying large quantities of tradable commodities is probably, in part, a hedge against a falling U.S. dollar. Thus, at the same time, the U.S. government needs to sell trillions of dollars of new bonds. It is by its own actions driving away foreign purchasers of bonds, which can only result in higher interest rates in the United States, which will further slow economic growth. What is particularly frightening is that neither political party has offered a serious plan to defuse the debt bomb. The Democrats are just piling up more debt as if there were no limit, and the Republicans, to date, are only proposing measures to reduce the increase, rather than reverse it. When the debt bomb explodes — within the next one to three years — expect to see record high real interest rates and/or inflation, coupled with a collapse of many &quot;entitlements.&quot; It will be like the neutron bomb, the buildings will be left standing, but the people will not. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke warned today of a &quot;fiscal crisis&quot; in coming years if the government does not act soon to curb federal retirement and health care entitlement programs, picking up a theme that his predecessor, Alan Greenspan, had pursued without success at the end of his term as head of the central bank. In prepared remarks delivered this morning to the Senate Budget Committee, Bernanke said that a dip this year in the annual federal budget deficit to $248 billion was &quot;the calm before the storm,&quot; with ballooning entitlement payments looming over the next 20 years as the Baby Boomers retire and medical costs skyrocket. By 2030, he said, spending under current law on Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid could consume as much as 15 percent of the nation's economic output, double the current rate. Underwriting that could lead to a &quot;vicious cycle,&quot; he said, as the nation borrows more to meet its obligations and spends increasing amounts to service that debt, leaving less for investors and consumers and slowing economic growth. &quot;If early and meaningful action is not taken, the U.S. economy could be seriously weakened with future generations bearing much of the cost&quot;... (Full piece here.) While dire warnings like these may seem alarmist, few people realize how conventional these frightening scenarios of the long-term budget picture have become in Washington policy circles. A famous example comes from the otherwise-staid Congressional Budget Office, who uses colorful language such as economic &quot;collapse&quot; to describe the possible impact of growing entitlement spending on the U.S. economy: Taken to the extreme, such a path [of borrowing to cover growing entitlement spending] could result in an economic crisis. Foreign investors could reduce their purchases of U.S. securities, the exchange value of the dollar could plunge, interest rates could climb, consumer prices could shoot up, or the economy could contract sharply. Amid the anticipation of declining profits and rising inflation and interest rates, stock markets could collapse and consumers might sharply reduce their consumption. Moreover, economic problems in the United States could spill over to the rest of the world and seriously weaken the economies of U.S. trading partners. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Sixty years later, we boomers have a lot to be worried about because most of us plan to retire in a few years and Social Security and Medicare are on the way to going bust. I should know because I used to be a trustee of the Social Security and Medicare trust funds. Those of you who are younger than we early boomers have even more to be worried about because if those funds go bust they won’t be there when you’re ready to retire. It’s already starting to happen. This year Social Security will pay out more in benefits than it receives in payroll taxes. The tipping point came sooner than anyone expected because the recession has kicked so many people off payrolls. But it was coming anyway. And it adds new urgency to reforming Social Security — a task the president’s commission on the nation’s debt is focusing on. So what’s the answer? Fed Chair Ben Bernanke this week listed the choices. “To avoid large and unsustainable budget deficits,” he said in a speech on Wednesday, “the nation must choose among higher taxes, modifications to entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare, less spending on everything else from education to defense, or some combination of the above.” Bernanke is almost certainly right about “some combination,” but he leaves out one other possible remedy that should be included in that combination: Immigration. You see, the biggest reason Social Security is in trouble, and Medicare as well, is because America is aging so fast. It’s not just that so many boomers are retiring. It’s also that seniors are living longer. And families are having fewer children. Add it all up and the number of people who are working relative to the number who are retired keeps shrinking. Forty years ago there were five workers for every retiree. Now there are three. Within a couple of decades, there will be only two workers per retiree. There’s no way just two workers will be able or willing to pay enough payroll taxes to keep benefits flowing to every retiree. This is where immigration comes in. Most immigrants are young because the impoverished countries they come from are demographically the opposite of rich countries. Rather than aging populations, their populations are bursting with young people. Yes, I know: There aren’t enough jobs right now even for Americans who want and need them. But once the American economy recovers, there will be. Take a long-term view and most new immigrants to the U.S. will be working for many decades. Get it? One logical way to deal with the crisis of funding Social Security and Medicare is to have more workers per retiree, and the simplest way to do that is to allow more immigrants into the United States. Immigration reform and entitlement reform have a lot to do with one another.</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Increased immigration solves the entitlement crisis --- they pay for entitlements through taxes but don’t collect the benefits</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Myers 8 (Dowell, PhD, professor and demographer, “Old Promises and New Blood: How Immigration Reform Can Help America Prosper in the Face of Baby Boomer Retirement”, The Reform Institute, Nov 24) </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Immigrant contributions to a more balanced senior ratio are vital for addressing the first peril of an aging society, namely the nation’s growing entitlements burden and the fiscal crisis. A greater proportion of working age residents supports fiscal stability because of the tax contributions made by immigrants. A series of recent studies have shown that, for example, ―… most immigrants pay the same taxes as native- born New Yorkers.‖26 Whether they occupy owned or rented homes, all residents pay property taxes, either directly or through a landlord. All residents also pay sales taxes and other taxes or fees on goods consumed (such as gasoline taxes). And even undocumented immigrants pay payroll taxes withheld by employers for Social Security and Medicare even though they will not qualify for those benefits themselves.27 Whether immigrants pay more in taxes than they receive in benefits is a more challenging question to answer. A key decision is whether to include the native-born children of immigrants in this calculation. All children are very expensive because of the high costs of education, by far the largest component of state and local government expenditures.28 Of course, over the longer run those education expenditures amount to investments in growing the next generation of workers and taxpayers, so a short- run calculation of costs and benefits does not provide the best perspective. Also, immigrants tend to be more expensive when newly arrived and return greater benefits later. Therefore, we need to cost out the fiscal impacts over the life cycle of both immigrants and their children. The authoritative study conducted in 1997 by the National Research Council (NRC) reported detailed simulations over three generations.29 That study reported substantial lifetime contributions by immigrants, net of services received and even more by their children. The NRC study found that the impacts of immigration depend not only on the relative numbers of immigrants but also on their age at arrival, whether that is before or after the expense of schooling, in the high taxpaying middle age period, or in retirement years. Also, the impacts are considerably less positive for immigrants with less than a high school education and are more positive for those with education beyond high school. Added to the difficulty of assessing impacts over time, there is the question of a spatial mismatch between taxes and services at different levels of government. It is widely recognized that more of the fiscal benefits of immigration go to the federal level (through payroll taxes), while more of the service costs fall to the state and local governments (primarily through spending on education and health). Thus, immigrants and their children can truly assist with bearing the weight of the entitlements crisis felt by the federal government. However, localities with large immigrant populations or new destinations for immigrant settlement may suffer a fiscal shock to their local budgets. In response, what would be desirable is a way to share more of the federal fiscal benefits of immigration with those localities. Similarly, we need to find a way to share more of the long- term benefits with the places where initial costs of investment are being borne. Overall, immigration may make good fiscal sense, but there are local wrinkles needing to be ironed out. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">US key to the global economy</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Caploe ‘9 (David Caploe is CEO of the Singapore-incorporated American Centre for Applied Liberal Arts and Humanities in Asia., “Focus still on America to lead global recovery”, April 7, The Strait Times, lexis)</span><br />
<span class="Underline">IN THE aftermath of the G-20 summit, most observers seem to have missed perhaps the most crucial statement of the entire event, made by United States President Barack Obama at his pre-conference meeting with British Prime Minister Gordon Brown: 'The world has become accustomed to the US being a voracious consumer market, the engine that drives a lot of economic growth worldwide,' he said. 'If there is going to be renewed growth, it just can't be the US as the engine.' While superficially sensible, this view is deeply problematic. To begin with, it ignores the fact that the global economy has in fact been 'America-centred' for more than 60 years. Countries - China, Japan, Canada, Brazil, Korea, Mexico and so on - either sell to the US or they sell to countries that sell to the US. This system has generally been advantageous for all concerned. America gained certain historically unprecedented benefits, but the system also enabled participating countries - first in Western Europe and Japan, and later, many in the Third World - to achieve undreamt-of prosperity. At the same time, this deep inter-connection between the US and the rest of the world also explains how the collapse of a relatively small sector of the US economy - 'sub-prime' housing, logarithmically exponentialised by Wall Street's ingenious chicanery - has cascaded into the worst global economic crisis since the Great Depression. To put it simply, Mr Obama doesn't seem to understand that there is no other engine for the world economy - and hasn't been for the last six decades. If the US does not drive global economic growth, growth is not going to happen. Thus, US policies to deal with the current crisis are critical not just domestically, but also to the entire world. Consequently, it is a matter of global concern that the Obama administration seems to be following Japan's 'model' from the 1990s: allowing major banks to avoid declaring massive losses openly and transparently, and so perpetuating 'zombie' banks - technically alive but in reality dead. As analysts like Nobel laureates Joseph Stiglitz and Paul Krugman have pointed out, the administration's unwillingness to confront US banks is the main reason why they are continuing their increasingly inexplicable credit freeze, thus ravaging the American and global economies. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">The Bush years have of course revealed the perils of drawing facile parallels between the challenges of the present day and the great catastrophes of the 20th century. Nevertheless, there is reason to fear that the biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression could have comparable consequences for the international system. For more than a decade, I pondered the question of why the 20th century was characterized by so much brutal upheaval. I pored over primary and secondary literature. I wrote more than 800 pages on the subject. And ultimately I concluded, in The War of the World, that three factors made the location and timing of lethal organized violence more or less predictable in the last century. The first factor was ethnic disintegration: Violence was worst in areas of mounting ethnic tension. The second factor was economic volatility: The greater the magnitude of economic shocks, the more likely conflict was. And the third factor was empires in decline: When structures of imperial rule crumbled, battles for political power were most bloody. In at least one of the world’s regions—the greater Middle East—two of these three factors have been present for some time: Ethnic conflict has been rife there for decades, and following the difficulties and disappointments in Iraq and Afghanistan, the United States already seems likely to begin winding down its quasi-imperial presence in the region. It likely still will. Now the third variable, economic volatility, has returned with a vengeance. U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke’s “Great Moderation”—the supposed decline of economic volatility that he hailed in a 2004 lecture—has been obliterated by a financial chain reaction, beginning in the U.S. subprime mortgage market, spreading through the banking system, reaching into the “shadow” system of credit based on securitization, and now triggering collapses in asset prices and economic activity around the world. After nearly a decade of unprecedented growth, the global economy will almost certainly sputter along in 2009, though probably not as much as it did in the early 1930s, because governments worldwide are frantically trying to repress this new depression. But no matter how low interest rates go or how high deficits rise, there will be a substantial increase in unemployment in most economies this year and a painful decline in incomes. Such economic pain nearly always has geopolitical consequences. Indeed, we can already see the first symptoms of the coming upheaval. In the essays that follow, Jeffrey Gettleman describes Somalia’s endless anarchy, Arkady Ostrovsky analyzes Russia’s new brand of aggression, and Sam Quinones explores Mexico’s drug-war-fueled misery. These, however, are just three case studies out of a possible nine or more. In Gaza, Israel has engaged in a bloody effort to weaken Hamas. But whatever was achieved militarily must be set against the damage Israel did to its international image by killing innocent civilians that Hamas fighters use as human shields. Perhaps more importantly, social and economic conditions in Gaza, which were already bad enough, are now abysmal. This situation is hardly likely to strengthen the forces of moderation among Palestinians. Worst of all, events in Gaza have fanned the flames of Islamist radicalism throughout the region—not least in Egypt. From Cairo to Riyadh, governments will now think twice before committing themselves to any new Middle East peace initiative. Iran, meanwhile, continues to support both Hamas and its Shiite counterpart in Lebanon, Hezbollah, and to pursue an alleged nuclear weapons program that Israelis legitimately see as a threat to their very existence. No one can say for sure what will happen next within Tehran’s complex political system, but it is likely that the radical faction around President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad will be strengthened by the Israeli onslaught in Gaza. Economically, however, Iran is in a hole that will only deepen as oil prices fall further. Strategically, the country risks disaster by proceeding with its nuclear program, because even a purely Israeli air offensive would be hugely disruptive. All this risk ought to point in the direction of conciliation, even accommodation, with the United States. But with presidential elections in June, Ahmadinejad has little incentive to be moderate. On Iran’s eastern border, in Afghanistan, upheaval remains the disorder of the day. Fresh from the success of the “surge” in Iraq, Gen. David Petraeus, the new head of U.S. Central Command, is now grappling with the much more difficult problem of pacifying Afghanistan. The task is made especially difficult by the anarchy that prevails in neighboring Pakistan. India, meanwhile, accuses some in Pakistan of having had a hand in the Mumbai terrorist attacks of last November, spurring yet another South Asian war scare. Remember: The sabers they are rattling have nuclear tips. The democratic governments in Kabul and Islamabad are two of the weakest anywhere. Among the biggest risks the world faces this year is that one or both will break down amid escalating violence. Once again, the economic crisis is playing a crucial role. Pakistan’s small but politically powerful middle class has been slammed by the collapse of the country’s stock market. Meanwhile, a rising proportion of the country’s huge population of young men are staring unemployment in the face. It is not a recipe for political stability. This club is anything but exclusive. Candidate members include Indonesia, Thailand, and Turkey, where there are already signs that the economic crisis is exacerbating domestic political conflicts. And let us not forget the plague of piracy in Somalia, the renewed civil war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the continuing violence in Sudan’s Darfur region, and the heart of darkness that is Zimbabwe under President Robert Mugabe. The axis of upheaval has many members. And it’s a fairly safe bet that the roster will grow even longer this year. The problem is that, as in the 1930s, most countries are looking inward, grappling with the domestic consequences of the economic crisis and paying little attention to the wider world crisis. This is true even of the United States, which is now so preoccupied with its own economic problems that countering global upheaval looks like an expensive luxury. With the U.S. rate of GDP growth set to contract between 2 and 3 percentage points this year, and with the official unemployment rate likely to approach 10 percent, all attention in Washington will remain focused on a nearly $1 trillion stimulus package. Caution has been thrown to the wind by both the Federal Reserve and the Treasury. The projected deficit for 2009 is already soaring above the trillion-dollar mark, more than 8 percent of GDP. Few commentators are asking what all this means for U.S. foreign policy. The answer is obvious: The resources available for policing the world are certain to be reduced for the foreseeable future. That will be especially true if foreign investors start demanding higher yields on the bonds they buy from the United States or simply begin dumping dollars in exchange for other currencies. Economic volatility, plus ethnic disintegration, plus an empire in decline: That combination is about the most lethal in geopolitics. We now have all three. The age of upheaval starts now.</span><br />

Unskilled Guest Workers Recruited to Work in U.S. Cut Off From Help When Victimized. One of the groups hardest hit by the immigrant restriction are those migrant workers here in the U.S. at their employer’s invitation on H-2B visas, a visa category for unskilled, non-agricultural workers performing seasonal or temporary jobs. H-2B visa holders were excluded from legal aid eligibility in 1996.[53] Two years ago, Congress eased the restriction slightly and made those H-2B visa holders working in the forestry industry eligible for legal aid.[54] However, those H-2B workers employed in other industries, such as construction, canning and tourism, remain ineligible.[55] H-2B workers often perform tasks that risk physical harm and frequently are mistreated by employers.[56] Many do not speak English and work in geographically isolated areas.[57] Without access to legal services, they are virtually without recourse when their rights are violated. Employers often take advantage of this fact by misclassifying agricultural workers, who should fall under the relatively more stringent protections of the H-2A visa program, as H-2Bs.[58] LSC grantee Texas RioGrande Legal Aid describes one case that involved an “illegal guestworker importation scheme” in which a grower and two farm labor contractors used over 400 H-2B workers to harvest and pack onions and watermelons from 2001 to 2007 in south and west Texas to circumvent the protections and benefits of the H-2A program, including access to LSC-funded representation.[59] TRLA was unable to represent any of the H-2B visa holders even though there was reason to believe that they had been abused at the hands of their employer and should have been issued visas that would have allowed them LSC representation.[60]<br />

“A lot of people have very unrealistic expectations,” he said. “Undocumented farm workers take jobs American workers don’t want, under conditions American workers won’t tolerate.” Farm workers often work in extreme conditions for long periods of time, usually for around minimum wage. Though estimates vary, the majority are undocumented. Rob Roy, president of the Ventura County Agricultural Association, said falsified documents present another obstacle for farmers looking to hire legal workers. “Fifty-five to 60 percent of people who work in the U.S. agriculture industry, while they appear to have legal documents, are not legal workers,” Roy said. “With the continued enforcement of [current immigration laws], farmers are going to see their workers taken away without any way to replace those workers.” Alicia Flores, director of Hermandad Mexicana Transnacional in Oxnard, a nonprofit group serving the Hispanic community, said the waiting period for immigrants already here to receive legal status is around 18 years. “That creates a problem for the residents. They don’t have a [driver’s] license, they don’t have insurance, they don’t have Social Security,” she said. Without immigration reform for those workers, some say Americans would find their eating habits drastically altered. ₪ stopped here at 15:00 ₪ “Just imagine Ventura County without the thousands of people who harvest the crops we have here,” said Lauro Barajas, director of United Farm Workers in the Oxnard region. “It is a job that feeds us, that gives us food on our table, so it’s important that these workers get attention.” For United Farm Workers, immigration reform means the AgJOBS Act, a bill which would reform the current guest worker program and provide a way for undocumented agricultural workers to earn legal status. “There’s no industry where there’s a greater penetration of undocumented workers than in agriculture, and there’s no industry where U.S. workers are less likely to go,” said Democratic Congressman Howard Berman of California’s 28th district in the San Fernando Valley, the bill’s sponsor. “We can bring in our fruits and lettuce and vegetables from Mexico or Central America or Europe, but do the American people want to be dependent on other countries for their entire food supply?” he asked.<br />

<span class="underline0">There may be no country on the planet more vulnerable to a massive cyberattack than the United States, where financial, transportation, telecommunications and even military operations are now deeply dependent on data networking. What's worse: U.S. security officials say the country's cyberdefenses are not up to the challenge. In part, it's due to a severe shortage of computer security specialists and engineers with the skills and knowledge necessary to do battle against would-be adversaries. The protection of U.S. computer systems essentially requires an army of cyberwarriors, but the recruitment of that force is suffering. &quot;We don't have sufficiently bright people moving into this field to support those national security objectives as we move forward in time,&quot; says James Gosler, a veteran cybersecurity specialist who has worked at the CIA, the National Security Agency and the Energy Department. If U.S. cyberdefenses are to be improved, more people like Gosler will be needed on the front lines. Gosler, 58, works at the Energy Department's Sandia National Laboratory in Albuquerque, N.M., where he focuses on ways to counter efforts to penetrate U.S. data networks. It's an ever-increasing challenge. &quot;You can have vulnerabilities in the fundamentals of the technology, you can have vulnerabilities introduced based on how that technology is implemented, and you can have vulnerabilities introduced through the artificial applications that are built on that fundamental technology,&quot; Gosler says. &quot;It takes a very skilled person to operate at that level, and we don't have enough of them.&quot; Gosler estimates there are now only 1,000 people in the entire United States with the sophisticated skills needed for the most demanding cyberdefense tasks. To meet the computer security needs of U.S. government agencies and large corporations, he says, a force of 20,000 to 30,000 similarly skilled specialists is needed. Some are currently being trained at the nonprofit SANS (SysAdmin, Audit, Network, Security) Institute outside Washington, D.C., but the demand for qualified cybersecurity specialists far exceeds the supply. &quot;You go looking for those people, but everybody else is looking for the same thousand people,&quot; says SANS Research Director Alan Paller. &quot;So they're just being pushed around from NSA to CIA to DHS to Boeing. It's a mess.&quot; The Center for Strategic and International Studies highlights the problem in a forthcoming report, &quot;A Human Capital Crisis in Cybersecurity.&quot; According to the report, a key element of a &quot;robust&quot; cybersecurity strategy is &quot;having the right people at every level to identify, build and staff the defenses and responses.&quot; The CSIS report highlights a &quot;desperate shortage&quot; of people with the skills to &quot;design secure systems, write safe computer code, and create the ever more sophisticated tools needed to prevent, detect, mitigate and reconstitute from damage due to system failures and malicious acts.&quot;</span><br />

<span class="underline0">Since 1998 I have publicly warned of Russia’s war preparations. The idea of preparing for nuclear war is absurd for most Americans, because the idea of nuclear war makes no sense in a consumer society. However that may be, Russia’s war preparations were as undeniable then as they are today. And Russia is not a consumer society. In the late 1990s Russia was refurbishing huge nuclear war bunkers and building underground cities. The only purpose such bunkers and cities could serve is in relation to a future nuclear war. For a country that was supposedly broke to be spending its precious resources on something so expensive, so far out of the way of “normal” expectations, seemed inexplicable. “Oh well,” people would shrug. “The Russians are used to doing this sort of thing. It gives them psychological comfort. Let them do what they want. It needn’t trouble us.” The public missed the fact, however, that Russia was continuing to violate arms control agreements. It was not admitting to all the nuclear warheads it possessed, and was not reliably disposing of them. It was developing new, deadly, biological and chemical weapons. Why in the midst of peace, a few short years after the end of the Cold War, were the Russians adhering to this insane path? Were they anticipating a future war? The answer must be yes. And the answer continues to be yes. In the 1990s Russia forged an alliance with China that involved a growing series of joint military exercises. Why would the Russians do this? Why would they seek to develop a joint military capability that would link Russian missile power with Chinese manpower? For over a decade the Russians have been providing the Chinese with technology and weapons. This is not merely a commercial transaction, as some would insist. These transactions are carefully considered strategic steps. Since the mid-1990s, Russia and China have initiated joint-armaments programs that further solidified their military partnership. It is obsolete thinking to suppose Russia and China are enemies. It must be understood, as a practical matter, that Russia and China are underdog powers locked in a struggle for primacy with the United States. The only sensible strategy, if Russia and China expect to emerge on top, is to unite against the Americans. And that is what the two countries have been doing for the past decade. A week ago today, on August 17, the Russians and Chinese conducted joint military exercises on Russian soil, in the southern Ural Mountains. These coincided with strategic air operations involving Russian nuclear bombers. The combination of ground exercises with nuclear bomber exercises is a characteristic of Soviet nuclear war theory, which holds that troops must be used to follow up nuclear strikes. President Putin and China’s President Hu Jintao watched the exercises while holding a summit in Bishkek (the capital of former Soviet Kyrgyzstan). While China and Russia insist that their preparations aren’t aimed at any specific power, only a simpleton would believe them. (I am sad to acknowledge that many Americans, in this regard, are simpletons.) Last week, in an obvious upgrading of nuclear war readiness, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the resumption of long-range nuclear bomber patrols that had previously been suspended in 1992. “I made the decision to restore flights of Russian strategic bombers on a permanent basis,” said Putin. “Combat duty has begun.” For some reason, Americans cannot digest Putin’s statement or his decision to resume bomber patrols. Why is this happening? Well, we say to ourselves, there is no reason other than the peculiar psychology of the Russians. President Bush has not put U.S. strategic bombers on patrol. And why should he? Russia isn’t our enemy. We are all friends. We are all economic partners and allies in the war against terror. In Washington the State Department spokesman, Sean McCormack, responded to the Russian announcement of permanent strategic bomber patrols by saying, “It’s interesting. We certainly are not in the kind of posture we were with what used to be the Soviet Union. It’s a different era. If Russia feels as though they want to take some of these old aircraft out of mothballs and get them flying again, that’s their decision.” It’s as if the Russian military had resumed stamp collecting or archery. There is no strategic alarm, no threat, no difficulty and no discomfiture. Let them play with their obsolete toys. We are living in a new era, and these activities no longer trouble us. The Cold War ended and the animosity between the great powers is gone. Say good-bye to it. Any evidence to the contrary is not evidence. We’re living in “a different era.” Anyone who doesn’t know this, even if they are the president of the Russian Federation, is out-of-step. One might imagine Washington’s reaction to a Russian missile strike against U.S. targets. “It’s interesting,” the State Department would purr. “This is not the sort of missile strike we would have expected from the Soviet Union. Of course, it’s a different era. If Russia feels that they want to launch some old, useless missiles, that’s their decision.” Our lack of imagination, our inability to grasp our enemy’s thought process, leads us to dismiss what is obvious. The Russians are getting ready. Why isn’t the American side responding? Why aren’t the Americans getting ready? We have been seduced by a series of comforting illusions. We are also absorbed in a struggle against Islamic terrorism (only we are at pains to admit the “Islamic” aspect of it). The American shopping mall regime produces stupefaction and complacency. The regime is predicated on economic optimism and entertainment. This optimism is about to be shattered. The Russians know this is going to happen, and they are preparing even as we fail to prepare.</span><br />

<span class="underline0">UNRULY RUSSIA Russia is believed to be developing significant cyberspace capabilities, too. Indeed, in April 2007, a massive cyber attack on the tiny Baltic state of Estonia by Russian hackers demonstrated how potentially catastrophic a pre-emptive digital strike could be on a developed nation. Pro-Russian hackers, some likely associated with the government, attacked numerous Web sites in neighboring Estonia — one of the world’s most wired countries — to protest the controversial removal of a Soviet war memorial located in the capital, Tallinn. The hackers brought down government and other Web sites, including the office of the president, the parliament, political parties, banks, news organizations and communications firms, using denial-of- service attacks, in which a server is bombarded with so many bogus requests for information that it overloads and crashes. Some of the attacks came from botnets — chains of perhaps thousands of zombie computers that have been hijacked by the malicious code of cyber pirates and linked together to take part in raids, often generating large volumes of spam, with or without their owners’ knowledge. Interestingly, a number of Estonian commentators wondered whether their defense ministry should have called on NATO to invoke Article V’s collective defense provision. An interesting point, but for the moment, NATO does not seem to view cyber attacks as a military action. Estonia has not been the only victim of an alleged Russian cyber attack. Moonlight Maze is the name given to series of coordinated attacks on Pentagon computers going back to the 1990s that may have originated in Russia, possibly compromising sensitive national security data. The Russians see cyber dominance as central to warfare. At a recent conference, a senior Russian general said victory in future conflicts will be decided by suppressing the opponent’s military and state institutions through information technologies. But it is not only major powers that are using cyberspace to advance their political-military objectives. Terrorists are all over the Internet, too. They use the Web to recruit, communicate, share information (such as bomb-making), relay threats, seek publicity for their cause, spread propaganda or gather publicly available information for target development. Terrorists also effectively use the Internet for fundraising — from both witting and unwitting donors. Terrorists, like cyber criminals, will use Web scams such as phishing to obtain private information such as passwords, while acting as a legitimate entity, to line their pockets. The Internet offers terrorists a multitude of advantages in waging their unconventional warfare: mobility, flexibility (if hacked or shut down by an Internet service provider), world-wide coverage with huge potential audiences and high-speed communications. Some Islamist hackers have promoted the notion of carrying out electronic jihad against infidel civilian infrastructure, economic and military targets. Serious attacks in which cyber terrorists take innocent lives via the Web in an effort to advance their cause may become reality in the future. In testimony to Congress in March 2007, Gen. James Cartwright, commander of U.S. Strategic Command, said: “America is under widespread attack in cyberspace. ... [T]he magnitude of cost, in terms of real dollars dedicated to defensive measures, lost intellectual capital and fraud, cannot be overestimated, making these attacks a matter of great national interest. Unlike the air, land and sea domains, we lack dominance in cyberspace and could grow increasingly vulnerable if we do not fundamentally change how we view this battle space.” State-sponsored and terrorist cyberspace efforts provide a cautionary tale to U.S. and other policymakers. Although many governments have devoted significant resources to cyber security, recent intrusions clearly demonstrate cyberspace vulnerabilities. A digital Pearl Harbor is by no means a certainty. But cyberspace is increasingly important to American national security — and complementary to the broad spectrum of modern warfare. The time to take heed of this challenge is now.</span><br />

<span class="underline0">It is no secret that modern warfare is increasingly dependent on advanced computers—and no country’s armed forces are more reliant on the digital age for information superiority than those of the U.S. This is both the American military’s greatest strength— and potentially its greatest weakness. Today, the Pentagon uses more than 5 million computers on 100,000 networks at as many as 1,500 sites in at least 65 countries worldwide. Not surprisingly, potential adversaries have taken note of America’s slavish dependence on information technology. The Defense Department suffers tens of thousands of computer network attacks annually. Although the department is understandably cautious about revealing the success of these attacks, some of the cyber assaults allegedly reduced the military’s operational capabilities. The Pentagon reportedly logged more than 79,000 attempted intrusions in 2005 — the most recent publicly available data. About 1,300 of the attacks supposedly were successful, including the reported penetration of computers linked to the Army’s 101st and 82nd Airborne and 4th Infantry divisions. Foreign cyberspace operations are a threat that is here and now — and cannot be ignored. Cyberspace operations, which include computer network attack, exploitation and defense, are not a new national security challenge. Cyber warfare was all the rage in the late 1990s but has faded in importance since 9/11, not surprisingly, in comparison to the threat of terrorism and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Cyber operations appeal to many state and nonstate actors, including terrorists, because they can be low-cost, low-risk and highly effective, and provide plausible deniability for the attacker, who can route operations through any number of surrogate servers across the Web en route to its target. Talk about “low-DNA” operations. Malicious code can launch viruses, crash networks, corrupt data, collect intelligence, spread misinformation, and interfere with vital friendly military and intelligence operations, including command, control, communications, navigation and logistics. In essence, if it is wired to the Web, it is potentially vulnerable. According to McAfee, an Internet security company, about 120 countries are involved in developing the ability to use the Internet as a weapon, not only against government networks, but also against soft targets such as financial markets and even critical civilian infrastructure. Although it is impossible to say how many raids go undetected, cyber attacks have grown increasingly sophisticated. The threat has grown from the work of curious hackers to premeditated government-sponsored operations that embrace a variety of security-related purposes.</span><br />

<span class="underline0">China's suspected role in much industrial espionage shouldn't drive U.S. decision making on cybersecurity, Wade said. &quot;I wouldn't get too hung up on where the threat comes from,&quot; he told a questioner. Much of the same technology to guard against cyberattacks is useful to prevent &quot;self- inflicted wounds&quot; by employees and software bugs. Minihan told another questioner that foreign adversaries already have a &quot;persistent presence&quot; in government systems, but that adversaries are limited by their ability to process all the information held by the government in exposed systems. The &quot;'gotcha' tip of the iceberg&quot; -- embarrassing breaches -- must not be the focus of agencies and cybersecurity providers, because the rest of the iceberg can be addressed with &quot;building codes and standards,&quot; Minihan said. Asked about an open letter to the White House from several security CEOs that called for more federal cybersecurity R&amp;D, Security Innovation Network founder Robert Rodriguez blamed the R&amp;D shortage partly on immigration rules. Some of the most innovative entrepreneurs in security have left the U.S. because of an H-1B visa shortage, he said. Wade said the National Science Foundation is promoting &quot;leap- ahead technology&quot; through sponsored conferences on both coasts to bring together academic researchers, and Defense is sponsoring similar gatherings. &quot;There's a substantial amount of money that's going to be thrown at this problem,&quot; but entrepreneurs must be ready to pitch a &quot;quantum leap&quot; in cybersecurity, not a marginally better product, Russell said. Any system can be hacked, so the U.S. needs a competitive advantage in advanced technology to stay ahead of threats, he said. -- Greg Piper </span><br />

<span class="underline0">Many practitioners assume that the H-2B has to be for lower-skilled positions and thus positions that are not appropriate for H-1B professions. That is not the case. As long as the requisite 'temporariness' of the position can be established, and as long as a shortage of qualified U.S. workers can be established through the requisite recruitment, H-2B becomes an option. However, it is important to emphasize that the requisite temporariness can be difficult to prove. The position must qualify as seasonal, peak-load, intermittent or one-time occurrence. For example, if it can be proven that the foreign national is needed to work on a specific project with a specific end date, the H-2B may be a viable option. However, unlike the other options, the H-2B has quota problems of its own, although there are certainly times of the year when the H-1B quota is exhausted and the H-2B may still be available.</span><br />

<span class="underline0">The advent of Internet attacks — especially those suspected of being directed by nations, not hackers — has given rise to a new term inside the Pentagon and the National Security Agency: “hybrid warfare.” It describes a conflict in which attacks through the Internet can be launched as a warning shot — or to pave the way for a traditional attack. Early hints of this new kind of warfare emerged in the confrontation between Russia and Estonia in April 2007. Clandestine groups — it was never determined if they had links to the Russian government — commandeered computers around the globe and directed a fire hose of data at Estonia’s banking system and its government Web sites. The computer screens of Estonians trying to do business with the government online were frozen, if they got anything at all. It was annoying, but by the standards of cyberwar, it was child’s play. In August 2008, when Russia invaded Georgia, the cyberattacks grew more widespread. Georgians were denied online access to news, cash and air tickets. The Georgian government had to move its Internet activity to servers in Ukraine when its own servers locked up, but the attacks did no permanent damage.</span><br />

<span class="underline0">A much greater existential risk emerged with the build-up of nuclear arsenals in the US and the USSR. An all-out nuclear war was a possibility with both a substantial probability and with consequences that might have been persistent enough to qualify as global and terminal. There was a real worry among those best acquainted with the information available at the time that a nuclear Armageddon would occur and that it might annihilate our species or permanently destroy human civilization. Russia and the US retain large nuclear arsenals that could be used in a future confrontation, either accidentally or deliberately. There is also a risk that other states may one day build up large nuclear arsenals. Note however that a smaller nuclear exchange, between India and Pakistan for instance, is not an existential risk, since it would not destroy or thwart humankind’s potential permanently. </span><br />

<span class="underline0">Nationwide, unemployment is up; but does that necessarily mean that snow and ice companies will be awash with seasonal labor when it comes time for companies to recruit good workers? Maybe. We all recognize that it's hard to find—and harder still to retain—good workers who will work all hours of the night and day in inclement weather conditions. But without a committed work force, companies cannot survive and prosper. A shortage of qualified employees is nothing new to the snow and ice management industry, so, how do you locate reliable workers in a changing economy? Unemployed bank tellers and investment bankers are probably not the answer. H-2B labor options Temporary legal foreign workers may be part of the solution. Recent changes in federal visa regulations make it possible for companies that depend on seasonal labor, even for a short period during the winter months, to take full advantage of the federal foreign H-2B temporary worker visa program. The H-2B visa program is based upon the premise that U.S. seasonal employers may hire foreign workers when they cannot find a sufficient number of U.S. workers to hire for the seasonal jobs. Now is the time to take a fresh look at H-2B and to capitalize on these new opportunities. Although the demand for H-2B workers has risen exponentially every year since 1996, only 66,000 new H-2B visas are available annually to satisfy all seasonal businesses, including hospitality, construction and landscaping. This limit does not begin to meet the demand for these reliable, hardworking legal foreign workers. As a result, employers and others in the H-2B community are working cooperatively to come up with strategies that maximize the availability of the H-2B seasonal labor supply. Employers in the snow and ice management industry could play a key role in this process—and at the same time benefit from using H-2B workers to supply at least a portion of their winter workers. </span><br />

<span class="underline0">“The US has run out of bullets,” said Nouriel Roubini, professor at New York University, and one of a caste of luminaries with grim forecasts at the annual Ambrosetti conference on Lake Como. “More quantitative easing (bond purchases) by the Federal Reserve is not going to make any difference. Treasury yields are already down to 2.5pc yet credit spreads are widening again. Monetary policy can boost liquidity but it can’t deal with solvency problems,” he told Europe’s policy elite. Dr Roubini said the US growth rate was likely to fall below 1pc in the second half of the year, despite the biggest stimulus in history: a cut in interest rates from 5pc to zero, a budget deficit of 10pc of GDP, and $3 trillion to shore up the financial system. The anaemic pace compares with rates of 4pc-6pc at this stage of recovery in normal post-war recoveries. “We have reached stall speed. Any shock at this point can tip you back into recession. With interbank spreads rising, you can get a vicious circle like 2008-2009,” he said, describing a self-feeding process as the real economy and the credit system hurt each other. “There is a 40pc chance of double-dip recession in the US, and worse in Japan. Even if it is not technically a recession it will feel like it,” he added. Hans-Werner Sinn, head of Germany’s IFO Institute, said the US would have to purge its debt excesses the hard way. “The bitter truth is that there is no way out of this with monetary and fiscal policy. They will just have to see their living standards go down. I see a decade of difficulties for the US,” he said.</span><br />
<span class="underline0">Double-dip recession now and will lead to high unemployment - </span><br />
<span class="underline0">Elwell 12/28/10 (Craig, Specialist in Macroeconomic Policy , December 28, “Double-Dip Recession: Previous Experience and Current Prospect”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://economic-legislation.blogspot.com/2010/12/double-dip-recession-previous.html" rel="nofollow">http://economic-legislation.blogspot.com/2010/12/double-dip-recession-previous.html</a>)</span><br />
<span class="underline0">Concerns have been expressed that the United States may be about to experience a “double-dip” recession. A double-dip or W-shaped recession occurs when the economy emerges from a recession, has a short period of growth, but then falls back into recession. This prospect raises policy questions about the current level of economic stimulus and whether added stimulus may be needed. The pace of the recovery has been below average and is decelerating, falling from a 5% to a 1.7% annual average rate of growth between the fourth quarter of 2009 and the second quarter of 2010. Other indicators, such as high unemployment, falling house prices, reduced flows of credit, and the prospect of fading fiscal stimulus, are also worrisome. Double-dip recessions are rare. There are only two modern examples of a double-dip recession for the United States: the recession of 1937-1938 and the recession of 1981-1982. They both had the common attribute of resulting from a change in economic policy. In the first case, recession was an unintended consequence of the policy change; in the second case, recession was an intended consequence. Historically, there has been what is termed a “snap back” relationship between the severity of the recession and the strength of the subsequent recovery. In other words, a sharp contraction followed by a robust recovery traces out a V-shaped pattern of growth. However, unlike earlier post-war recessions, the recent recession occurred with a financial crisis. Research suggests that a slow recovery with sustained high unemployment is the norm in the aftermath of a deep financial crisis.</span><br />
<span class="underline0">Unemployment destroys the economy – consumer spending</span><br />

<span class="underline0">GMJ: Six to eight months ago, many economists were saying the economy would reach its nadir in summer 2009, then it would start to grow again -- or at least stop contracting so fast. Do you think that's likely? Dr. Jacobe: It's a matter of perspective. I think most economists were saying that the second half is when we'd start to see a recovery. Then things got worse, so that got modified. Now, most economists think the economy will bottom out in the second half of 2009 and begin recovery in 2010. I think given the current situation, that is the most likely scenario. But there are several reasons for concern. First, the current economic downturn started as a financial crisis led to a crisis for the overall economy. Although the financial situation seems to be improving, I'm still concerned about the flow of credit to consumers and small businesses. The evaporation of the so-called shadow banking system of securitization, increased bank capital requirements, a return to old-time underwriting standards, and increased credit losses in such sectors as commercial real estate and credit cards all suggest reduced credit availability compared to anything experienced during the past several years. Second, we are in a period of business uncertainty unparalleled since the 1930s. Business owners and managers simply have little or no &quot;visibility&quot; going forward. Consumers have changed their spending habits and businesses have stopped investing. Further, there appears to be a level of &quot;government risk&quot; that is unprecedented in the post WWII period. This may be the right time -- even a golden opportunity -- for achieving &quot;change&quot; in many major business sectors politically, but the resulting increased uncertainty could &quot;metastasize&quot; the current recession. Third, now we're in a more traditional recession. As more businesses disappear and unemployment goes up even more, there could be another pullback in spending by consumers and businesses. As you can tell, right now I'm really worried about consumer spending. In this regard, most people think of the job market as a lagging indicator, but I think employment is the key to rebuilding the consumer psychology that allows consumers to spend comfortably and on big-ticket items. I think people need to feel more secure about their jobs -- and they need to feel more secure about their personal balance sheets -- before we'll see a real upswing in the general economy. What we really need to see is more stability in the job market, more job creation, and a real increase in consumer spending before we'll get any real recovery.</span><br />
<span class="underline0">Low skilled immigration is key to the economy and solves all the links to wage deflation – multiple warrants</span><br />

<span class="underline0">Yet that is exactly the effect of an immigration policy that fails to recognize and meet our need for unskilled foreign labor. Mr. Camarota could not be more wrong about immigration's consequences for the economy. In fact, rather than taking jobs from Americans, immigrants grow the pie for everyone: attracting investment, making capital more productive, and filling jobs at the low end of the ladder so that increasingly educated Americans can maximize their productivity. Newcomers don't generally compete with the native-born, they complement them, to everyone's benefit. Even the 9 percent of American workers who haven't completed high school—the only ones who go head-to-head with immigrants and whose wages sometimes suffer as a result, though by no more than a few percentage points over the past twenty years—make up what they lose in wages in cheaper services. Meanwhile, immigrant entrepreneurs create jobs, and immigration allows many industries, including agriculture and food processing, to stay in the United States rather than move where labor is cheaper. Yes, many immigrants are poor, uneducated workers who pay relatively little in taxes. But that's precisely the point: even with modern technology—in some cases, because of it—we still need a significant number of low-skilled workers to keep our economy running. Surely Mr. Camarota isn't suggesting that we do the right thing when we profit from their labor but, by keeping them illegal, limit their access to services? And if anything, once they became legal residents, they would pay more of their fair share of the taxes that pay for those benefits.</span><br />
<span class="underline0">Low skilled immigration promotes growth – the newest study prove</span><br />

<span class="underline0">Over all, it turns out that the continuing arrival of immigrants to American shores is encouraging business activity here, thereby producing more jobs, according to a new study. Its authors argue that the easier it is to find cheap immigrant labor at home, the less likely that production will relocate offshore. The study, “Immigration, Offshoring and American Jobs,” was written by two economics professors — Gianmarco I. P. Ottaviano of Bocconi University in Italy and Giovanni Peri of the University of California, Davis — along with Greg C. Wright, a Ph.D. candidate at Davis. The study notes that when companies move production offshore, they pull away not only low-wage jobs but also many related jobs, which can include high-skilled managers, tech repairmen and others. But hiring immigrants even for low-wage jobs helps keep many kinds of jobs in the United States, the authors say. In fact, when immigration is rising as a share of employment in an economic sector, offshoring tends to be falling, and vice versa, the study found. In other words, immigrants may be competing more with offshored workers than with other laborers in America. American economic sectors with much exposure to immigration fared better in employment growth than more insulated sectors, even for low-skilled labor, the authors found. It’s hard to prove cause and effect in these studies, or to measure all relevant variables precisely, but at the very least, the evidence in this study doesn’t offer much support for the popular bias against immigration, and globalization more generally. We see the job-creating benefits of trade and immigration every day, even if we don’t always recognize them. As other papers by Professor Peri have shown, low-skilled immigrants usually fill gaps in American labor markets and generally enhance domestic business prospects rather than destroy jobs; this occurs because of an important phenomenon, the presence of what are known as “complementary” workers, namely those who add value to the work of others. An immigrant will often take a job as a construction worker, a drywall installer or a taxi driver, for example, while a native-born worker may end up being promoted to supervisor. And as immigrants succeed here, they help the United States develop strong business and social networks with the rest of the world, making it easier for us to do business with India, Brazil and most other countries, again creating more jobs. For all the talk of the dangers of offshoring, there is a related trend that we might call in-shoring. Dell or Apple computers may be assembled overseas, for example, but those products aid many American businesses at home and allow them to expand here. A cheap call center in India can encourage a company to open up more branches to sell its products in the United States. Those are further examples of how some laborers can complement others; it’s not all about one group of people taking jobs from another. Job creation and destruction are so intertwined that, over all, the authors find no statistically verifiable connection between offshoring and net creation of American jobs. We’re all worried about unemployment, but the problem is usually rooted in macroeconomic conditions, not in immigration or offshoring. (According to a Pew study, the number of illegal immigrants from the Caribbean and Latin America fell 22 percent from 2007 to 2009; their departure has not had much effect on the weak United States job market.) Remember, too, that each immigrant consumes products sold here, therefore also helping to create jobs. When it comes to immigration, positive-sum thinking is too often absent in public discourse these days. Debates on immigration and labor markets reflect some common human cognitive failings — namely, that we are quicker to vilify groups of different “others” than we are to blame impersonal forces. Consider the fears that foreign competition, offshoring and immigration have destroyed large numbers of American jobs. In reality, more workers have probably been displaced by machines — as happens every time computer software eliminates a task formerly performed by a clerical worker. Yet we know that machines and computers do the economy far more good than harm and that they create more jobs than they destroy.</span><br />

<span class="underline0">The Professional Landcare Network (PLANET) recently released figures showing the dramatic economic impact that could result if Congress does not act quickly regarding the H-2B crisis. Senators Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.) and John Warner (R-Va.) have tried once again this year to extend the returning worker provision under the H-2B visa program for five years. The $43 billion landscape industry is one of many in the United States that depends on seasonal workers to survive. Companies throughout these industries face chronic shortages of temporary seasonal workers that Congress partially relieved through the H-2B program's returning worker exemption. Unfortunately, this provision, which rewards those companies and individuals who follow the law, expired on September 30 despite widespread bipartisan support for its extension. The program proposes exempting returning seasonal workers from counting against the national cap of 66,000 people. A cap exemption was added three years ago, but the clause expired on September 30, a day before the new fiscal year. The cap exemption is typically met within the first months of the fiscal year. In the past, the cap has been met by January, leaving many lawn and landscape businesses without the workers they need for their crucial spring season. There are stringent rules on advertising these jobs to Americans, and companies must work diligently to try to fill these positions with American workers before they are opened up to guest workers. It is estimated that 2.5 American jobs are tied to each H-2B seasonal worker. &quot;It's not just companies in our industry and the communities they serve who are suffering,&quot; said Tom Delaney, PLANET's director of government affairs. &quot;The H-2B disaster also puts at risk the welfare of American workers and their families. And, as significantly, Congress' failure to act is placing in jeopardy American jobs at truck assembly and equipment manufacturing plants, not to mention other companies that support and supply our industry.&quot;</span><br />

<span class="underline0">Caploe ‘9 (David Caploe is CEO of the Singapore-incorporated American Centre for Applied Liberal Arts and Humanities in Asia., “Focus still on America to lead global recovery”, April 7, The Strait Times, lexis)</span><br />
<span class="underline0">IN THE aftermath of the G-20 summit, most observers seem to have missed perhaps the most crucial statement of the entire event, made by United States President Barack Obama at his pre-conference meeting with British Prime Minister Gordon Brown: 'The world has become accustomed to the US being a voracious consumer market, the engine that drives a lot of economic growth worldwide,' he said. 'If there is going to be renewed growth, it just can't be the US as the engine.' While superficially sensible, this view is deeply problematic. To begin with, it ignores the fact that the global economy has in fact been 'America-centred' for more than 60 years. Countries - China, Japan, Canada, Brazil, Korea, Mexico and so on - either sell to the US or they sell to countries that sell to the US. This system has generally been advantageous for all concerned. America gained certain historically unprecedented benefits, but the system also enabled participating countries - first in Western Europe and Japan, and later, many in the Third World - to achieve undreamt-of prosperity. At the same time, this deep inter-connection between the US and the rest of the world also explains how the collapse of a relatively small sector of the US economy - 'sub-prime' housing, logarithmically exponentialised by Wall Street's ingenious chicanery - has cascaded into the worst global economic crisis since the Great Depression. To put it simply, Mr Obama doesn't seem to understand that there is no other engine for the world economy - and hasn't been for the last six decades. If the US does not drive global economic growth, growth is not going to happen. Thus, US policies to deal with the current crisis are critical not just domestically, but also to the entire world. Consequently, it is a matter of global concern that the Obama administration seems to be following Japan's 'model' from the 1990s: allowing major banks to avoid declaring massive losses openly and transparently, and so perpetuating 'zombie' banks - technically alive but in reality dead. As analysts like Nobel laureates Joseph Stiglitz and Paul Krugman have pointed out, the administration's unwillingness to confront US banks is the main reason why they are continuing their increasingly inexplicable credit freeze, thus ravaging the American and global economies. </span><br />

<span class="underline0">The Bush years have of course revealed the perils of drawing facile parallels between the challenges of the present day and the great catastrophes of the 20th century. Nevertheless, there is reason to fear that the biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression could have comparable consequences for the international system. For more than a decade, I pondered the question of why the 20th century was characterized by so much brutal upheaval. I pored over primary and secondary literature. I wrote more than 800 pages on the subject. And ultimately I concluded, in The War of the World, that three factors made the location and timing of lethal organized violence more or less predictable in the last century. The first factor was ethnic disintegration: Violence was worst in areas of mounting ethnic tension. The second factor was economic volatility: The greater the magnitude of economic shocks, the more likely conflict was. And the third factor was empires in decline: When structures of imperial rule crumbled, battles for political power were most bloody. In at least one of the world’s regions—the greater Middle East—two of these three factors have been present for some time: Ethnic conflict has been rife there for decades, and following the difficulties and disappointments in Iraq and Afghanistan, the United States already seems likely to begin winding down its quasi-imperial presence in the region. It likely still will. Now the third variable, economic volatility, has returned with a vengeance. U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke’s “Great Moderation”—the supposed decline of economic volatility that he hailed in a 2004 lecture—has been obliterated by a financial chain reaction, beginning in the U.S. subprime mortgage market, spreading through the banking system, reaching into the “shadow” system of credit based on securitization, and now triggering collapses in asset prices and economic activity around the world. After nearly a decade of unprecedented growth, the global economy will almost certainly sputter along in 2009, though probably not as much as it did in the early 1930s, because governments worldwide are frantically trying to repress this new depression. But no matter how low interest rates go or how high deficits rise, there will be a substantial increase in unemployment in most economies this year and a painful decline in incomes. Such economic pain nearly always has geopolitical consequences. Indeed, we can already see the first symptoms of the coming upheaval. In the essays that follow, Jeffrey Gettleman describes Somalia’s endless anarchy, Arkady Ostrovsky analyzes Russia’s new brand of aggression, and Sam Quinones explores Mexico’s drug-war-fueled misery. These, however, are just three case studies out of a possible nine or more. In Gaza, Israel has engaged in a bloody effort to weaken Hamas. But whatever was achieved militarily must be set against the damage Israel did to its international image by killing innocent civilians that Hamas fighters use as human shields. Perhaps more importantly, social and economic conditions in Gaza, which were already bad enough, are now abysmal. This situation is hardly likely to strengthen the forces of moderation among Palestinians. Worst of all, events in Gaza have fanned the flames of Islamist radicalism throughout the region—not least in Egypt. From Cairo to Riyadh, governments will now think twice before committing themselves to any new Middle East peace initiative. Iran, meanwhile, continues to support both Hamas and its Shiite counterpart in Lebanon, Hezbollah, and to pursue an alleged nuclear weapons program that Israelis legitimately see as a threat to their very existence. No one can say for sure what will happen next within Tehran’s complex political system, but it is likely that the radical faction around President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad will be strengthened by the Israeli onslaught in Gaza. Economically, however, Iran is in a hole that will only deepen as oil prices fall further. Strategically, the country risks disaster by proceeding with its nuclear program, because even a purely Israeli air offensive would be hugely disruptive. All this risk ought to point in the direction of conciliation, even accommodation, with the United States. But with presidential elections in June, Ahmadinejad has little incentive to be moderate. On Iran’s eastern border, in Afghanistan, upheaval remains the disorder of the day. Fresh from the success of the “surge” in Iraq, Gen. David Petraeus, the new head of U.S. Central Command, is now grappling with the much more difficult problem of pacifying Afghanistan. The task is made especially difficult by the anarchy that prevails in neighboring Pakistan. India, meanwhile, accuses some in Pakistan of having had a hand in the Mumbai terrorist attacks of last November, spurring yet another South Asian war scare. Remember: The sabers they are rattling have nuclear tips. The democratic governments in Kabul and Islamabad are two of the weakest anywhere. Among the biggest risks the world faces this year is that one or both will break down amid escalating violence. Once again, the economic crisis is playing a crucial role. Pakistan’s small but politically powerful middle class has been slammed by the collapse of the country’s stock market. Meanwhile, a rising proportion of the country’s huge population of young men are staring unemployment in the face. It is not a recipe for political stability. This club is anything but exclusive. Candidate members include Indonesia, Thailand, and Turkey, where there are already signs that the economic crisis is exacerbating domestic political conflicts. And let us not forget the plague of piracy in Somalia, the renewed civil war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the continuing violence in Sudan’s Darfur region, and the heart of darkness that is Zimbabwe under President Robert Mugabe. The axis of upheaval has many members. And it’s a fairly safe bet that the roster will grow even longer this year. The problem is that, as in the 1930s, most countries are looking inward, grappling with the domestic consequences of the economic crisis and paying little attention to the wider world crisis. This is true even of the United States, which is now so preoccupied with its own economic problems that countering global upheaval looks like an expensive luxury. With the U.S. rate of GDP growth set to contract between 2 and 3 percentage points this year, and with the official unemployment rate likely to approach 10 percent, all attention in Washington will remain focused on a nearly $1 trillion stimulus package. Caution has been thrown to the wind by both the Federal Reserve and the Treasury. The projected deficit for 2009 is already soaring above the trillion-dollar mark, more than 8 percent of GDP. Few commentators are asking what all this means for U.S. foreign policy. The answer is obvious: The resources available for policing the world are certain to be reduced for the foreseeable future. That will be especially true if foreign investors start demanding higher yields on the bonds they buy from the United States or simply begin dumping dollars in exchange for other currencies. Economic volatility, plus ethnic disintegration, plus an empire in decline: That combination is about the most lethal in geopolitics. We now have all three. The age of upheaval starts now.</span><br />

<span class="underline0">Unpredictable legislation and regulation is coming, and it will destroy the reforestation sector – the H2A revision proves</span><br />
<span class="underline0">Brown ‘9 (Chris, NCFA Director of Communications, http:www.ncforestry.org/WEBPAGES/MEMBERSECTION/ATREELINE/treeline%20issues/2009%20Treeline/DECEMBER%20TREELINE%20WEB.pdf)</span><br />
<span class="underline0">While it has taken a backseat to the state of the economy and the health care debate, immigration reform is another polarizing issue that has consequences that stretch farther than what most of us realize. Some want to build a wall while others want to grant amnesty. Mike Kelly, the president of Mike Kelly Forestry Services, Inc., just wants to be able to put trees in the ground the same way he has for the past 24 years – employing temporary foreign workers through the H2B Non-Agriculture visa program. The reforestation industry’s dependence on temporary workers has become one of several pawns in the political chess game that is being played out in Washington. Since December of 2008, forestry contractors, such as Kelly have witnessed four significant changes in the US Governments H2A guest worker program that would affect how they are going to be able to legally comply with the United States Department of Labor’s visa programs in 2010. “We need a set of rules that matches what the realities are out here on the ground,” stated a frustrated Kelly. “This industry ebbs and flows with timber markets – weather conditions – we need rules that reflect an understanding of the circumstances that we are up against out here in order to get a job done.” On September 4, 2009 The Department of Labor proposed a radical change in how reforestation contractors use the guest worker program. Kelly predicts that if the latest mandate – a call to shift reforestation contractors out of the H2B non-agriculture visa program and into the H2A agriculture visa program – the reforestation industry as we know it will be finished. “The majority of the tree planting contractors in this country rely heavily on temporary workers,” stated Kelly. “It’s a simple fact that most of all tree planting in this country is done by temporary workers. If we lose this program, it will be a real challenge to meet the replanting and other reforestation needs of our country.” The H2A visa program is tailored towards the agriculture community. Among the countless rules in the program, the H2A visa program requires that workers be provided with free housing that must be inspected by a government official prior to inhabitance and the workers are limited to a 50 to 75-mile radius of that residence. These two elements alone would put most, if not all, tree planters out of business because it would just be impossible to execute. “The H2A program is an agricultural program,” stated Kelly. “Primarily for people who once you bring the workers in, they are working on one farm within a reasonable amount of distance from where they are housed. What they are not taking into account – is that we are not able to do that – our work is scattered over a much broader geographical area.” Working under the H2B visa program since 1986, reforestation contractors are afforded the ability to submit an itinerary that allows them to move workers throughout the country based on the workload. While the H2B program demands the completion of a ream of paperwork and additional costs on tree planters, for planters such as Kelly, it had become a necessary burden that he had learned to live with – that is until the tampering with the program began in September 2009. “I am probably as close to being able to meet the requirements of the proposed H2A visa revisions because I am very regional, primarily in North Carolina, but even I can’t,” stated Kelly who considers himself a small player in this industry. Kelly typically employs a crew of 15-18 men and on occasion has run two crews based on the demand for his services. “Most of my work is within a 50-to-75 mile radius of my home base,” explained Kelly. “Some of my clients have work on the coast or near the Virginia border. If I had to comply with H2A rules, I would have to go through the whole recertification process once I have moved beyond the 75 mile distance and bring in separate workers or go through a lengthy and costly transfer process of visas to another certificate - even if it is only for a few days work.” So what’s at stake? Last year, one southeast state failed to meet its reforestation goals because of the shortage of tree planters. Private landowners throughout the nation would be hard pressed to find companies that were still able to compete while staying in legal compliance with the H2A visa program. Kelly and some of his fellow contractors from across the U.S. have formed the Forestry Contractors Task Force. The Task Force is now made up of companies large and small from all regions throughout the United States. They joined ranks with The Forest Resources Association to begin to lobby Washington for some clarification and quite frankly, some clear, realistic thinking, on this every changing issue. “The Task Forces’ membership is growing,” stated Kelly. “We have had more people come on board recently when they realized that if we don’t do something collectively, we are facing some serious trouble. The future and survival of our industry is at stake.” In the public policy arena, the legal use of temporary workers is a focus for a few special interest groups within the Washington beltline – one that would like to see the jobs filled with American workers – another who argue about the conditions the temporary workers operate in – and even another who would like to see all temporary work programs go away as part of a new amnesty policy for individuals who failed to enter the country through proper channels. Collectively, these different agendas are no doubt the source for this latest major assault on the program. For Kelly, the concern raised about his workforce is pure speculation by people who have no clue how this industry operates. The proof is the planting, so to speak. </span><br />

<span class="underline0">The southern United States has some of the world’s most intensively managed forests. Seventy-nine percent of the total acres planted in trees in the United States were in the Southern region. Most were planted by Latin American migrant laborers. Research found that contractors complained American workers were unwilling to do manual labor. The need for cheap and reliable labor has driven the forest industry to seek labor outside our borders. According to research at Auburn University, migrant laborers plant the nearly 2 million acres of trees every winter in the South. They are recruited through a temporary nine-month H-2B Guest Worker visa program. H-2B migrant laborers, prevalent in the South since the late 1980s have transformed the southern landscape from dwindling agriculture to booming forestry. Labor laws The H-2B Guest Worker program was implemented after the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. This program was designed to prevent employers from hiring illegal workers. It was designed to provide temporary labor to employers who could demonstrate a shortage of local labor in nonagriculture seasonal jobs. In 2004, migrant labor constituted 84 percent of the forest management labor force, according to Auburn research. Reforestation and herbicide applications are heavily dominated by migrant labor. Dwindling profit margins and American laborers demanding higher wages led the forestry industry to depend on &quot;imported&quot; labor. In 2005, about 89,000 laborers worked under the H-2B program in forestry, seafood processing, landscaping, construction and other nonagriculture jobs. The Department of Labor indicates that 13 percent work in the forest industry, leading all industries in the number of visas requested annually. </span><br />

<span class="underline0">Forests are more than a symbolic ideal of wilderness, more than quiet places to enjoy nature. Forest ecosystems -- trees, soil, undergrowth, all living things in a forest -- are critical to maintaining life on earth. Forests help us breathe by creating oxygen and filtering pollutants from the air, and help stabilize the global climate by absorbing carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas. They soak up rainfall like giant sponges, preventing floods and purifying water that we drink. They provide habitat for 90 percent of the plant and animal species that live on land, as well as homelands for many of the earth's last remaining indigenous cultures. Forests are commercially important, too; they yield valuable resources like wood, rubber and medicinal plants, including plants used to create cancer drugs. Harvesting these resources provides employment for local communities. Healthy forests are a critical part of the web of life. Yet more than half of the earth's original forest cover has been destroyed due to human activity such as agriculture, development and logging. Much of the loss has occurred within the past three decades. Protecting the earth's remaining forest cover is now an urgent task.</span><br />

<span class="underline0">America's richly, diverse forests provide vital products and amenities to our society. Through scientific management, sustained production of pulpwood, saw timber, veneer, poles, and chemical by-products is possible from our forests. Our nation's privately-owned forests also provide many important values not found on developed lands, including: quality habitat for wildlife, biodiversity of plant and animal communities, clean water, aesthetic benefits and recreational opportunities. As one of the 10 million non-industrial private forest landowners in America who own 59 percent of the nation's timberland, your forests, management objectives, and reasons you own forest land have a tremendous impact on the quality, productivity, and sustainability of our forests. As a landowner, your forest land offers you many values and opportunities. Implementing sustainable forestry practices on your forestland can secure the longevity of your forestry investment creating a valuable resource and heritage for future generations. Sustainable forestry can be viewed as the practice of a land stewardship ethic which integrates the reforestation, managing, growing, nurturing, and harvesting of trees for useful products with the conversation of soil, air, and water quality, wildlife and fish habitat, and aesthetics. Reforestation following harvest is the cornerstone of forest sustainability; therefore, a priority in forest management is establishing new stands of trees. Forest management is a cycle of renewal and harvest. Prompt reforestation ensures that new forests are in place to prevent soil erosion and protect water quality in streams and lakes. Many species of wildlife, such as quail, rabbit, deer, elk, moose, ruffed grouse and wild turkey, can be found using newly established forests for food, shelter and nesting. As a private landowner, your management objectives may or may not focus on growing forests to produce timber. Perhaps your interests center on managing wildlife habitat; creating aesthetically pleasing areas; protecting soil and water quality; or enhancing recreational opportunities, in addition to protecting and improving forest health and productivity. Practicing sustainable forestry goes beyond emphasizing production of timber from the forest to a philosophy of sustaining all forest values and the inherent ability to produce them. Prompt reforestation is a key to practicing sustainable forestry and ensures that impacts on other forest values from harvesting are managed to obtain the maximum benefits possible. Reforestation Opportunities Site preparation, planting, clearcutting, natural regeneration, uneven-aged management, direct seeding, group selection…. do you feel it is a daunting task to choose the &quot;best&quot; reforestation and management technique? Often, no single technique is &quot;best&quot;; your forest management objectives can likely be achieved using several different reforestation and management techniques. A good way to start sorting out your options is to become familiar with the practices used for reforestation in your area. Seek the advice of a professional forester to help you evaluate and plan effective reforestation practices to meet your forest management objectives. Your forest site, the species composition of you forest, and local markets dictate reforestation systems that are biologically and economically feasible.</span><br />
<span class="underline0">We’re on the brink of an oxygen crisis—only forests can maintain survival of earth</span><br />
<span class="underline0">Tatchell ‘8 (human rights activist, internally quotes ecologists, Peter, 8/13, The oxygen crisis, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/aug/13/carbonemissions.climatechange" rel="nofollow">http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/aug/13/carbonemissions.climatechange</a>)</span><br />
<span class="underline0">Compared to prehistoric times, the level of oxygen in the earth's atmosphere has declined by over a third and in polluted cities the decline may be more than 50%. This change in the makeup of the air we breathe has potentially serious implications for our health. Indeed, it could ultimately threaten the survival of human life on earth, according to Roddy Newman, who is drafting a new book, The Oxygen Crisis. I am not a scientist, but this seems a reasonable concern. It is a possibility that we should examine and assess. So, what's the evidence? Around 10,000 years ago, the planet's forest cover was at least twice what it is today, which means that forests are now emitting only half the amount of oxygen. Desertification and deforestation are rapidly accelerating this long-term loss of oxygen sources. The story at sea is much the same. NASA reports that in the north Pacific ocean oxygen-producing phytoplankton concentrations are 30% lower today, compared to the 1980s. This is a huge drop in just three decades. Moreover, the UN environment programme confirmed in 2004 that there were nearly 150 &quot;dead zones&quot; in the world's oceans where discharged sewage and industrial waste, farm fertiliser run-off and other pollutants have reduced oxygen levels to such an extent that most or all sea creatures can no longer live there. This oxygen starvation is reducing regional fish stocks and diminishing the food supplies of populations that are dependent on fishing. It also causes genetic mutations and hormonal changes that can affect the reproductive capacity of sea life, which could further diminish global fish supplies. Professor Robert Berner of Yale University has researched oxygen levels in prehistoric times by chemically analysing air bubbles trapped in fossilised tree amber. He suggests that humans breathed a much more oxygen-rich air 10,000 years ago. Further back, the oxygen levels were even greater. Robert Sloan has listed the percentage of oxygen in samples of dinosaur-era amber as: 28% (130m years ago), 29% (115m years ago), 35% (95m years ago), 33% (88m years ago), 35% (75m years ago), 35% (70m years ago), 35% (68m years ago), 31% (65.2m years ago), and 29% (65m years ago). Professor Ian Plimer of Adelaide University and Professor Jon Harrison of the University of Arizona concur. Like most other scientists they accept that oxygen levels in the atmosphere in prehistoric times averaged around 30% to 35%, compared to only 21% today – and that the levels are even less in densely populated, polluted city centres and industrial complexes, perhaps only 15 % or lower. Much of this recent, accelerated change is down to human activity, notably the industrial revolution and the burning of fossil fuels. The Professor of Geological Sciences at Notre Dame University in Indiana, J Keith Rigby, was quoted in 1993-1994 as saying: In the 20th century, humanity has pumped increasing amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere by burning the carbon stored in coal, petroleum and natural gas. In the process, we've also been consuming oxygen and destroying plant life – cutting down forests at an alarming rate and thereby short-circuiting the cycle's natural rebound. We're artificially slowing down one process and speeding up another, forcing a change in the atmosphere. Very interesting. But does this decline in oxygen matter? Are there any practical consequences that we ought to be concerned about? What is the effect of lower oxygen levels on the human body? Does it disrupt and impair our immune systems and therefore make us more prone to cancer and degenerative diseases? Surprisingly, no significant research has been done, perhaps on the following presumption: the decline in oxygen levels has taken place over millions of years of our planet's existence. The changes during the shorter period of human life have also been slow and incremental – until the last two centuries of rapid urbanisation and industrialisation. Surely, this mostly gradual decline has allowed the human body to evolve and adapt to lower concentrations of oxygen? Maybe, maybe not. The pace of oxygen loss is likely to have speeded up massively in the last three decades, with the industrialisation of China, India, South Korea and other countries, and as a consequence of the massive worldwide increase in the burning of fossil fuels. In the view of Professor Ervin Laszlo, the drop in atmospheric oxygen has potentially serious consequences. A UN advisor who has been a professor of philosophy and systems sciences, Laszlo writes: Evidence from prehistoric times indicates that the oxygen content of pristine nature was above the 21% of total volume that it is today. It has decreased in recent times due mainly to the burning of coal in the middle of the last century. Currently the oxygen content of the Earth's atmosphere dips to 19% over impacted areas, and it is down to 12 to 17% over the major cities. At these levels it is difficult for people to get sufficient oxygen to maintain bodily health: it takes a proper intake of oxygen to keep body cells and organs, and the entire immune system, functioning at full efficiency. At the levels we have reached today cancers and other degenerative diseases are likely to develop. And at 6 to 7% life can no longer be sustained.</span><br />

<span class="underline0">But it isn't just the destruction of the rainforests that should trouble us. Healthy ecosystems the world over provide hidden services like waste disposal, nutrient cycling, soil formation, water purification, and oxygen production. Such services are best rendered by ecosystems that are diverse. Yet, through both intention and accident, humans have introduced exotic species that turn biodiversity into monoculture. Fast-growing zebra mussels, for example, have outcompeted more than 15 species of native mussels in North America's Great Lakes and have damaged harbors and water-treatment plants. Native prairies are becoming dominated by single species (often genetically homogenous) of corn or wheat. Thanks to these developments, soils will erode and become unproductive - which, along with temperature change, will diminish agricultural yields. Meanwhile,with increased pollution and runoff, as well as reduced forest cover, ecosystems will no longer be able to purify water; and a shortage of clean water spells disaster. In many ways, oceans are the most vulnerable areas of all. As overfishing eliminates major predators, while polluted and warming waters kill off phytoplankton, the intricate aquatic food web could collapse from both sides. Fish, on which so many humans depend, will be a fond memory. As phytoplankton vanish, so does the ability of the oceans to absorb carbon dioxide and produce oxygen. (Half of the oxygen we breathe is made by phytoplankton, with the rest coming from land plants.) Species extinction is also imperiling coral reefs - a major problem since these reefs have far more than recreational value: They provide tremendous amounts of food for human populations and buffer coastlines against erosion. In fact, the global value of &quot;hidden&quot; services provided by ecosystems - those services, like waste disposal, that aren't bought and sold in the marketplace - has been estimated to be as much as $50 trillion per year, roughly equal to the gross domestic product of all countries combined. And that doesn't include tangible goods like fish and timber. Life as we know it would be impossible if ecosystems collapsed. Yet that is where we're heading if species extinction continues at its current pace. Extinction also has a huge impact on medicine. Who really cares if, say, a worm in the remote swamps of French Guiana goes extinct? Well, those who suffer from cardiovascular disease. The recent discovery of a rare South American leech has led to the isolation of a powerful enzyme that, unlike other anticoagulants, not only prevents blood from clotting but also dissolves existing clots. And it's not just this one species of worm: Its wriggly relatives have evolved other biomedically valuable proteins, including antistatin (a potential anticancer agent), decorsin and ornatin (platelet aggregation inhibitors), and hirudin (another anticoagulant). Plants, too, are pharmaceutical gold mines. The bark of trees, for example, has given us quinine (the first cure for malaria), taxol (a drug highly effective against ovarian and breast cancer), and aspirin. More than a quarter of the medicines on our pharmacy shelves were originally derived from plants. The sap of the Madagascar periwinkle contains more than 70 useful alkaloids, including vincristine, a powerful anticancer drug that saved the life of one of our friends. Of the roughly 250,000 plant species on Earth, fewer than 5 percent have been screened for pharmaceutical properties. Who knows what life-saving drugs remain to be discovered? Given current extinction rates, it's estimated that we're losing one valuable drug every two years. Our arguments so far have tacitly assumed that species are worth saving only in proportion to their economic value and their effects on our quality of life, an attitude that is strongly ingrained, especially in Americans. That is why conservationists always base their case on an economic calculus. But we biologists know in our hearts that there are deeper and equally compelling reasons to worry about the loss of biodiversity: namely, simple morality and intellectual values that transcend pecuniary interests. What, for example, gives us the right to destroy other creatures? And what could be more thrilling than looking around us, seeing that we are surrounded by our evolutionary cousins, and realizing that we all got here by the same simple process of natural selection? To biologists, and potentially everyone else, apprehending the genetic kinship and common origin of all species is a spiritual experience - not necessarily religious, but spiritual nonetheless, for it stirs the soul. But, whether or not one is moved by such concerns, it is certain that our future is bleak if we do nothing to stem this sixth extinction. We are creating a world in which exotic diseases flourish but natural medicinal cures are lost; a world in which carbon waste accumulates while food sources dwindle; a world of sweltering heat, failing crops, and impure water. In the end, we must accept the possibility that we ourselves are not immune to extinction</span><br />

<span class="underline0">An article in the October 16, 1998 issue of Science (see also ABSNews.com report) by S. Fan and others presents evidence that North America's second-growth forests south of latitude 51 absorb 1.7 (SE = 0.5) billion tons of atmospheric carbon annually. This claim, which is based on a study of north-to-south and west-to-east atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration gradients, is in sharp conflict with estimates derived from measurements of forest production. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations (2), forest production in the whole of North America (including the vast boreal forest, which lies north of latitude 51), is just under one billion cubic metres of harvestable stemwood per year. The FAO estimates North America's total timber harvest at just under 0.6 billion cubic metres of stemwood per year. Net accumulation of standing timber is thus estimated to be approximately 0.4 billion cubic metres per year, representing the accumulation of approximately 100 million tons of carbon. To this might be added up to 150 million tons of carbon contained in the 0.6 billion cubic metres of harvested timber on the optimistic assumption that all is converted to products which either have a life time comparable to that of a forest, or are indefinitely recycled without loss. An annual increment of one hundred million tons of carbon in harvestable timber implies an accumulation of approximately 150 million tons of carbon in whole-tree biomass (i.e., including leaves, branches and roots as well as harvestable stemwood). In addition, carbon accumulates in forest soils in the form of leaf and branch litter, dead stems and roots. The accumulation of soil organic matter can exceed that in living biomass by a factor of as much as two. Thus, based on the FAO data, one can estimate that North America's forests comprise a sink for, at most, 150 million tons each in living forest biomass and harvested wood products, plus 300 million tons in forest soil organic matter, for a total of 600 million tons annually. But this implies a North American carbon sink only one-third the size of that inferred in the Science paper. If the Science paper is correct, it implies that ground-based estimates of forest yield have overlooked two-thirds of North America's annual accumulation of timber (i.e., growth less timber harvested), or about 1.2 billion cubic metres. It might seem difficult to overlook that much wood--more than a cubic kilometer added to inventory each year. However, the undetected additional volume would be spread over 0.8 billion hectares, and would thus amount to no more than a millimeter or two in annual mean tree diameter growth, or just one or two cubic metres of timber per hectare. Given that ground-based estimates of forest yield are dependent on plot measurements made over many years, some dating back more than half a century, they may not reflect the impact on tree growth of recent changes in climate and atmospheric chemistry. As the authors of the Science paper note, a small rise in temperature, accompanied by increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, nitrogen deposition rates and precipitation may provide a more potent stimulus to forest production than has yet been generally recognized. But the results reported by Fan et al. are based on a limited data set and need confirmation with results from a more comprehensive atmospheric sampling network than that available at present. In the meantime, the study is bound to stir controversy. The United States and Canada, as signatories of the Kyoto agreement, must take steps to regulate their net carbon emissions. However, with combined emissions from fossil fuel combustion of 1.6 billion tons per year, i.e., less than the inferred forest carbon sink, both countries may be net absorbers of carbon. Whatever the true magnitude of the North American forest carbon sink, the report by Fan et al. emphasizes the central role that forests play in regulating the composition of the atmosphere. If a massive North American forest carbon sink is confirmed, it will have major and, on the whole fortunate, implications; among them that timber, a vital industrial raw material, will be in abundant supply for the foreseeable future. North America alone could, if necessary, supply all of present world timber demand on a sustainable basis. Further, the result implies that the productivity of second-growth forests in North America is so large that there is no urgent economic justification for allowing further inroads into North America's remaining stands of old-growth timber until their role both as a carbon reservoir in the global carbon cycle and in the maintenance of biodiversity has been clarified.</span><br />

<span class="underline0">Carbon. From the time when the first living organisms coalesced in a sea permeated with long-chained molecules, this element has been essential to life on earth. Like water and oxygen, we cannot live without it. Carbon’s importance arises from its crucial provision of both structure and energy to living creatures. Carbon’s very long chains and rings are the backbones of most organic molecules. Break living bodies of any sort into organs, break the organs into cells, and the cells into molecules, look inside, and you will find a string of carbon atoms. If you could somehow pull all these carbon strings from the organism, little would remain of either the organism’s form or function. But carbon also flows through organisms and, when doing so, provides the energy that allows them to laugh, play, migrate, reproduce -- to perform virtually any function that we associate with being alive. This energy comes stored in the molecular bonds that hold the carbon chains together. Think about it. If you need an energy boost, you grab a CARBO-hydrate -- a food with quickly digested and readily available carbon compounds. Given the importance of long-chained carbon compounds, it was crucial that living creatures developed mechanisms for producing these complex molecules and assuring that they could be readily transferred from one organism to another. Hence the significance of the carbon cycle, which is diagrammed in a simplified form in Figure 1. Through this cycle, carbon (in the form of carbon dioxide, or CO2) is pulled from the atmosphere by green plants, which engage the sun’s energy to form the long carbon chains (a process called photosynthesis). The carbon chains, and the energy they contain, are then handed from one creature to another as a series of meals -- from corn to pig to human, from grass to rabbit to decomposing fungi. Eventually, the molecules release their energy and break back down to emit CO2 (a process called respiration). The CO2 released into the atmosphere plays another crucial role. CO2, with other greenhouse gases, provides an insulating blanket that holds in the sun’s warmth and heats the earth’s surface to a temperature that is hospitable to life -- about 60°F warmer than it would be otherwise. </span><br />
<span class="underline0">She Continues...</span><br />
<span class="underline0">All complex carbon compounds are tiny storage vaults for the sun’s energy. We know now that those vaults can be opened to fuel a forest or our own bodies, our cars, our hospitals, and our factories. The trick is not how to do so -- it’s how to do so in a sustainable manner. It’s how to maintain the cycles so that carbon can continue to provide balanced services -- as a global temperature regulator as well as an energy source and structural building block for life on earth. CGRER’s research is directed toward further deciphering and better tending the intricacies of the carbon cycle so that the earth’s thin film of carbon-dependent life can continue to flourish.</span><br />
<span class="underline0">Contention 4: Water Supply</span><br />
<span class="underline0">First, terrorism is INEVITABLE and COMING NOW – must build up our defenses </span><br />
<span class="underline0">Allison ‘7</span><br />
<span class="underline0">[Graham Allison, Director – Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, Professor of Government, and Faculty Chair of the Dubai Initiative – Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government, “Symposium: Apocalypse When?”, The National Interest, November / December 2007, Lexis]</span><br />
<span class="underline0">MUELLER IS entitled to his opinion that the threat of nuclear proliferation and nuclear terrorism is &quot;exaggerated&quot; and &quot;overwrought.&quot; But analysts of various political persuasions, in and out of government, are virtually unanimous in their judgment to the contrary. As the national-security community learned during the Cold War, risk = likelihood x consequences. Thus, even when the likelihood of nuclear Armageddon was small, the consequences were so catastrophic that prudent policymakers felt a categorical imperative to do everything that feasibly could be done to prevent that war. Today, a single nuclear bomb exploding in just one city would change our world. Given such consequences, differences between a 1 percent and a 20 percent likelihood of such an attack are relatively insignificant when considering how we should respond to the threat. Richard Garwin, a designer of the hydrogen bomb who Enrico Fermi once called &quot;the only true genius I had ever met&quot;, told Congress in March that he estimated a &quot;20 percent per year probability [of a nuclear explosion-not just a contaminated, dirty bomb-a nuclear explosion] with American cities and European cities included.&quot; My Harvard colleague Matthew Bunn has created a model in the Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science that estimates the probability of a nuclear terrorist attack over a ten-year period to be 29 percent-identical to the average estimate from a poll of security experts commissioned by Senator Richard Lugar in 2005. My book, Nuclear Terrorism, states my own best judgment that, on the current trend line, the chances of a nuclear terrorist attack in the next decade are greater than 50 percent. Former Secretary of Defense William Perry has expressed his own view that my work may even underestimate the risk. Warren Buffet, the world's most successful investor and legendary odds-maker in pricing insurance policies for unlikely but catastrophic events, concluded that nuclear terrorism is &quot;inevitable.&quot; He stated, &quot;I don't see any way that it won't happen.&quot; To assess the threat one must answer five core questions: who, what, where, when and how? Who could be planning a nuclear terrorist attack? Al-Qaeda remains the leading candidate. According to the most recent National Intelligence Estimate (NIE), Al-Qaeda has been substantially reconstituted-but with its leadership having moved from a medieval Afghanistan to Pakistan-a nation that actually has nuclear weapons. As former CIA Director George J. Tenet's memoir reports, Al-Qaeda's leadership has remained &quot;singularly focused on acquiring WMDs&quot; and that &quot;the main threat is the nuclear one.&quot; Tenet concluded, &quot;I am convinced that this is where [Osama bin Laden] and his operatives want to go.&quot; What nuclear weapons could terrorists use? A ready-made weapon from the arsenal of one of the nuclear-weapons states or an elementary nuclear bomb constructed from highly enriched uranium made by a state remain most likely. As John Foster, a leading U.S. bomb-maker and former director of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, wrote a quarter of a century ago, &quot;If the essential nuclear materials are at hand, it is possible to make an atomic bomb using information that is available in the open literature.&quot; Where could terrorists acquire a nuclear bomb? If a nuclear attack occurs, Russia will be the most likely source of the weapon or material. A close second, however, is North Korea, which now has ten bombs worth of plutonium, or Pakistan with sixty nuclear bombs. Finally, research reactors in forty developing and transitional countries still hold the essential ingredient for nuclear weapons. When could terrorists launch the first nuclear attack? If terrorists bought or stole a nuclear weapon in good working condition, they could explode it today. If terrorists acquired one hundred pounds of highly enriched uranium, they could make a working elementary nuclear bomb in less than a year</span><br />
<span class="underline0">Terrorist will soon target the water supply – several reasons: </span><br />
<span class="underline0">First, vulnerability </span><br />
<span class="underline0">Deininger ‘9</span><br />
<span class="underline0">[Robert. Environmental Engineer Prof @ Umich. “Protecting the Nation’s Critical Infrastructure: The Vulnerability of the US Water Supply Systems” 2009]</span><br />
<span class="underline0">There is growing concern about the vulnerability of the U.S. infrastructure to deliberate sabotage, including the susceptibility of water distribution systems to terrorist attacks. There are a number of factors that make water supply systems particularly vulnerable: they are spatially diverse, susceptible to intrusion, and contain many components. Water tanks and storage reservoirs are particularly vulnerable to deliberate sabotage. All water distribution systems use pumps to transfer water and maintain pressure. Besides normal water supply functions for domestic and industrial consumption, most municipal water systems must provide sufficient flow and pressure for fire-fighting purposes. All of these functions could be disrupted with well- placed and well-timed attacks. </span><br />
<span class="underline0">AND</span><br />
<span class="underline0">This is the most likely scenario</span><br />
<span class="underline0">Hock ‘9 [VF. Environmental Engineer with the US Army. “Secure Water Supply” DTIC, April 09.]</span><br />
<span class="underline0">Deliberate food and water contamination remains the easiest way to distribute biological or chemical agents for the purpose of terrorism, despite the national focus on dissemination of these agents as small-particle aerosols or volatile liquids. Moreover, biological terrorism as a result of sabotage of our food supply has already occurred in the United States. A review of naturally occurring food- and waterborne outbreaks exposes this vulnerability and reaffirms that, depending on the site of contamination, a significant number of people could be infected or injured over a wide geographic area. Major knowledge gaps exist with regard to the feasibility of current disinfection and inspection methods to protect our food and water against contamination by a number of biological and chemical agents. </span><br />
<span class="underline0">Second, AGING INFRASTRUCTURE </span><br />
<span class="underline0">Hock ‘9 [VF. Environmental Engineer with the US Army. “Secure Water Supply” DTIC, April 09.]</span><br />
<span class="underline0">There are nearly 50,000 community and 200,000 public and private water systems in operation today. Concerns have been raised over protecting the nation's water supply from terrorist attacks. While many believe that the threat of contamination of drinking water through terrorist activities is low (those that are out of touch with reality), a grim warning from Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson acknowledges the threat. In his resignation speech he stated that an attack on our food or water supply would be 'so easy to do.' In the U.S.the water supply systems are owned and operated by many different entities.Some by State or local government and others by private companies. The water systems throughout the nation are highly distributed by design. A distributed design allows flexibility when the system suffers equipment failures or routine maintenance. It is this type of design that makes safeguarding the water supply highly complex and extremely costly. The nation's water system is comprised of interlocking components that include: the water supply system (dams, reservoirs, natural lakes, wells, etc.); water treatment and filtration system; the water distribution system (pipes, pumps, valves storage tanks, etc.); and of course control systems often run by computers. These systems are mostly aging and in urgent need of upgrading, not simply to protect them from terrorist attack but to keep them handling the growing water needs of the nation. Where could attacks occur? Our nation's water systems are set up to deal with contaminants.Many feel that a terrorist attack which places chemicals or even biological agents in the water supply is unlikely to be successful. Contamination of a reservoir with a biological agent would not likely produce a large risk to public health because of the dilution effect.These reservoirs contain hundreds of thousands and in some cases millions of gallons of water.A massive amount of contaminant would be required for a successful terrorist attack at this point.If agents were to be introduced at this point they are likely to be detected and unlikely to survive the chlorination process. Even so, filtration and disinfection of the water may occur down stream mitigating the contamination.However, if the point contamination is after a treatment facility where filters, chlorination and other preventative measures would no longer be effective, the likelihood of success is much greater. Fortunately, this type of act is still subject to the dilution issue which would lessen the severity of such an attack. There are scenarios that have been discussed where the likelihood of success is high and for obvious reasons we will not go into any further details about those specific scenarios. Attacks on the nation's water supply can come in many forms. Contamination from chemical or biological agents or merely disruption to the processing, filtration and distribution are two types of attacks.The primary threats to the nation's drinking water supplies are contamination by chemical, biological or radiological agents; damage, destruction, or sabotage of physical infrastructure; and disruption to computer systems. </span><br />
<span class="underline0">Third, it’s cheap </span><br />
<span class="underline0">Hock ‘9</span><br />
<span class="underline0">[VF. Environmental Engineer with the US Army. “Secure Water Supply” DTIC, April 09.]</span><br />
<span class="underline0">On initial inspection of the water distribution layout represented in Figure 1, it is tempting to guess that a chemical or biological agent could be introduced at the water reservoir or the treatment plant. This method of attack would allow the attacker to act at some distance from the kill zone. The attack may have one of two basic objectives: denial of service or human casualties. As the system has few redundant components, a denial of service attack at the reservoir or treatment center is a real possibility, especially through the use of high explosives. In order to create widespread casualties, however, the amount of contaminant required to permeate the whole system would, after taking dilution into account, either be too large to handle expeditiously or far more expensive than other readily available terrorist weapons. Within the water distribution industry, this concept is summarized by the phrase dilution is the solution. Hence, a CB attack capable of causing casualties must be initiated close to the target facility. Conceding that an attack with CB agents must take place somewhere in the distribution system close to the target, several misconceptions about this type of attack still persist. Current dogma holds that such attacks require the assistance of several technicians, are expensive to carry out, and require pumping equipment to inject contaminants into a pressurized system. More recent studies by the Corps of Engineers, among others, show that CB attacks could in fact be carried out for as little as 80 cents per lethal dose, that a single individual can obtain or produce effective contaminants in quantity, and that contaminants can be introduced into the distribution system without the aid of pumping equipment via a method called backflow attack. </span><br />
<span class="underline0">Fourth, CONVENTIONAL RESPONSE MEASURES will FAIL </span><br />
<span class="underline0">Hock ‘9 [VF. Environmental Engineer with the US Army. “Secure Water Supply” DTIC, April 09.]</span><br />
<span class="underline0">The single most common misconception of how to handle a contaminated water distribution system is to “just shut the water off.” Such a response would have several undesirable effects. Stopping the water flow within the system does not halt the spread of the contaminant via diffusion. Additionally, many components in water distribution systems are severely stressed under loss of pressure and can easily fail, so pipe implosion and various forms of valve and pump failure are likely. Also, a system shutdown does not simply mean that customers need to find another source for consumption; it means that important industrial operations and fire protection services will be interrupted for the duration. </span><br />
<span class="underline0">Fifth, terrorists PREFER to attack water because it AFFECTS CIVILIANS</span><br />
<span class="underline0">Hock ‘9 [VF. Environmental Engineer with the US Army. “Secure Water Supply” DTIC, April 09.]</span><br />
<span class="underline0">Having stated that a terrorist attack on a water distribution system can be inexpensive, carried out with methods that are not technically difficult, and requires technical finesse in the response, one must estimate if such an attack is likely given the current strategic methods used by terrorists. Terrorist attacks are part theater. [Hoffman 1971] A terrorist attack is intended to have meaning both to the victim’s peer group (i.e., the terrorized) and to observers who are actually or potentially sympathetic with the terrorists’ cause. The result must be easily communicated to and understood by both groups. Hence, most attacks are chosen because they are easily interpreted in video and still pictures. A crashed airliner, a burning building, or explosions do not require explanation in multiple languages to be understood by an international audience. For example, the current insurgency in Iraq has been careful to make detailed video recordings of their terrorist acts. These video recordings then appear on DVDs that are used as recruiting tools. In one scenario, the attack on a water supply is not carried out in isolation, but is one phase of a compound attack. A dual attack could start with a denial of service attack on a water supply followed by arson or bombings in the affected service area. The initial denial of service attack can either take the form of destroying a water main or inducing authorities to shut down a system due to contamination concerns. The complementary attack would be designed to cause maximal fire damage while the fire suppression water supply is unavailable.</span><br />
<span class="underline0">Current water infrastructure outdated</span><br />
<span class="underline0">IAF ‘9</span><br />
<span class="underline0">[Eric Lotke, Alex Carter and Armand Biroonak, February 2009, “Beyond Recovery”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ourfuture.org/files/assets.ourfuture.org/documents/inv-20090210-beyond-recovery.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.ourfuture.org/files/assets.ourfuture.org/documents/inv-20090210-beyond-recovery.pdf</a>]</span><br />
<span class="underline0">Safe drinking water and adequate wastewater treatment are critical for any community to survive. The vast majority of our nation’s water infrastructure was built in the post-World War II era, and much of it has exceeded its 50-year useful life-span.53 Many people and businesses rely on pipes that are over 100 years old, putting health, safety and the economy at risk.54 Most water infrastructure — approximately 90 percent — is paid for at the county and local level.55 Cash-strapped municipalities pay $4.5 billion annually for water supply services, and another $5.3 billion for sewerage.56 States contribute $300 million to the Clean Water and Drinking Water State Revolving Funds.57 Meanwhile, federal funding has decreased by around 20 percent over the past decade, with federal contributions for water infrastructure totaling just over $3 billion annually.58 The 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act would have provided some relief, with $11.8 billion over two years for water and wastewater projects. A total of $8 billion is allocated for the Clean Water State Revolving Fund — including waste disposal — and the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund. $1.5 billion is allocated for rural water and waste disposal, while $500 million is set for water reclamation. The remainder is allocated for U.S. Army Corps of Engineer Projects and Department of Interior agencies. Our water infrastructure needs run much deeper, however. The Environmental Protection Agency warns of an investment shortfall of around $263 billion for drinking water over the next 20 years, and over $390 billion for wastewater infrastructure.59 The Water Infrastructure Network, a broad-based coalition of local elected officials, water service providers, health administrators, engineers and environmentalists, estimates that $23 billion is needed annually on top of current funding is required to replace aging drinking and wastewater infrastructure to comply with Clean Water Act standards.60 The American Society of Civil Engineers and the Water Infrastructure Network estimate that $12 billion annually is needed just for sewerage.61 Investing in water infrastructure can create a wave of new jobs. Every $1 billion in water infrastructure investment is estimated to create 57,400 jobs, both directly and indirectly.62 The recovery plan alone is estimated to generate over 500,000 jobs.63 Construction by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ allows for 125,000 jobs.64 The Association of State and Interstate Water Pollution Control Administrators state the Clean Water Fund and Drinking Water Fund projects can generate nearly 400,000 jobs.65 The Congressional Research Service estimates that nearly 9,500 jobs can be created by water recycling programs.66 Beyond job creation, water infrastructure is the staple for the multibillion dollar commercial and recreation industries. </span><br />
<span class="underline0">Repairing crippled water infrastructure solves</span><br />
<span class="underline0">Hock ‘9 [VF. Environmental Engineer with the US Army. “Secure Water Supply” DTIC, April 09.]</span><br />
<span class="underline0">The speed and assurance demonstrated during treatment and cleanup after an attack are crucial to restoring user confidence in the water distribution system. Even a series of minor delays or missteps in the recovery of this key utility could lead to years of consumer mistrust. The two most likely forms of attack on a water distribution system are electro-mechanical damage (e.g., from an explosion) and contamination (e.g., CB agents). Electrical and mechanical damage are repaired with comparative ease because such damage, albeit in less severe forms, is commonly encountered in everyday operations. Damage from construction equipment or weather events, for example, are sufficiently common that maintenance personnel are experienced or familiar with cleanup and repair procedures. By comparison, attacks using CB contaminants are virtually unseen by most system operators, and countermeasures may vary depending on the particular agent used. Indeed, given the large array of readily available CB agents, a comprehensive list of contaminants and their corresponding treatment and cleanup methods would be difficult to collect. For example, there are many decontamination methods for pipe systems, including flushing, scouring, swabbing or pigging, jetting or balling, chemical cleaning, and cleaning and re-lining. These methods have coverage rates that range from 60 m to 5 km of pipe per day. The cost of these methods is inversely proportional to the coverage rate. [Ellison et. al.] In order to address a terrorist attack that uses contaminants, there is a long list of science and engineering questions to which responders need reliable answers. Examples include the following: What zones are affected? How rapidly will the affected zones change? Can a temporary treatment device be inserted at a key point in the system? What method should be used to decontaminate the system? Given the large number of potential contaminants, the variety of treatment methods available, and the rarity of such events up to the present time, some form of computerized decision support tool could prove useful. The foundation for any such tool would be a complete understanding of the physicochemical aspects of CB agent fate and transport within a water distribution system.

<span class="underline0">Low skilled workers are key restore infrastructure, but Americans don’t want to do this work anymore</span><br />
<span class="underline0">Ratzenberger ‘10 (John, inventor, entrepreneur and board member of the Foundation for Fair Civil Justice, “Skilled workers key to state, national economies,” 7/31/10 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://newsok.com/skilled-workers-key-to-state-national-economies/article/3480964" rel="nofollow">http://newsok.com/skilled-workers-key-to-state-national-economies/article/3480964</a>)</span><br />
<span class="underline0">A cultural shift has taken place in America that's tragically made the skilled worker a thing of the past. Our media has glorified celebrity at the expense of our nation's basic needs, and America will reap the whirlwind within the next two decades. At stake is nothing less than our long-term economic vitality and national security. Let's start with infrastructure — bridges, roads, water and sewer systems. America is dangerously close to failures that will result in loss of life and are already resulting in loss of economic competitiveness. In many cases, currently funded infrastructure projects cannot move forward due to lack of skilled workers. For example, a national shortage of 500,000 welders has resulted in delays or cancellations of many key projects. Expand that out over the entire economy and we have a massive crisis on our hands. By 2012, there will be a 3 million skilled worker shortfall in our nation, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. In Oklahoma, which has had solid energy and manufacturing industries, top companies have difficulty finding adequate skilled workers to fill positions. The average age of American skilled workers is 55, which means the bulk of our skilled worker base will retire in the next decade. There are not enough skilled workers to replace them and maintain the nation's competitive global position. In my interviews with employers across the nation, I hear the same story: Business owners are desperate for skilled workers. Many are reaching out to local schools to attract young people into the trades. Despite the offer of good pay and benefits, the noble skills that involve working with your hands and mind don't hold the same appeal as they did in decades past. Some businesses are considering moving their operations (and jobs) overseas. We're experiencing the loss of the once-vaunted edge that America enjoyed. From aviation to energy, our national security is at risk. In order to maintain the world's most sophisticated military, we must produce systems, parts and hardware in America. Without domestic manufacturing operations, critical component work has been moved offshore as a stop-gap measure. The lens through which I view the world is simple: The manual arts always take precedence over the fine arts. Remember, someone had to build the ceiling before Michelangelo could go to work. Negative images of skilled workers — what I call &quot;essential workers&quot; — pervade our culture. The truth is, high-profile athletes and entertainers are non-essential. If all the celebrities like me disappeared overnight, it would be sad, but the world would continue with little disruption.

<span class="underline0">A second scenario is to forgo the attack’s value as a video publicity opportunity and target a fixed facility with the intention of disrupting the target nation’s ability to respond to terrorist acts. Examples of such targets would be fixed military facilities engaged in mobilization or logistic support, fixed military facilities engaged in command and control of a deployed force, or selected government facilities engaged in law enforcement or judicial proceedings. Additionally, fixed facility targets might also include foreign facilities strongly associated with U. S. interests, including embassies, commercial buildings, or manufacturing facilities. </span><br />

<span class="underline0">Of all the weapons of mass destruction, the genetically engineered biological weapons, many without a known cure or vaccine, are an extreme danger to the continued survival of life on earth. Any perceived military value or deterrence pales in comparison to the great risk these weapons pose just sitting in vials in laboratories. While a &quot;nuclear winter” resulting from a massive exchange of nuclear weapons, could also kill off most of life on earth and severely compromise the health of future generations, they are easier to control. Biological weapons, on the other hand, can get out of control very easily, as the recent anthrax attacks has demonstrated. There is no way to guarantee the security of these doomsday weapons because very tiny amounts can be stolen or accidentally released and then grow or be grown to horrendous proportions. The Black Death of the Middle Ages would be small in comparison to the potential damage bioweapons could cause. Abolition of chemical weapons is less of a priority because, while they can also kill millions of people outright, their persistence in the environment would be less than nuclear or biological agents or more localized. Hence, chemical weapons would have a lesser effect on future generations of innocent people and the natural environment. Like the Holocaust, once a localized chemical extermination is over, it is over. With nuclear and biological weapons, the killing will probably never end. Radioactive elements last tens of thousands of years and will keep causing cancers virtually forever. Potentially worse than that, bio-engineered agents by the hundreds with no known cure could wreck even greater calamity on the human race than could persistent radiation. AIDS and ebola viruses are just a small example of recently emerging plagues with no known cure or vaccine. Can we imagine hundreds of such plagues? HUMAN EXTINCTION IS NOW POSSIBLE. </span><br />
<span class="underline0">Causes retaliation</span><br />
<span class="underline0">Conley ‘3 [Lt. Harry. Chief of the Systems Analysis Branch @ Headquarters Air Combat Command. “Not With Impunity” The Air and Space Power Journal, Spring 03. Lexis]</span><br />
<span class="underline0">The number of American casualties suffered due to a WMD attack may well be the most important variable in determining the nature of the US reprisal. A key question here is how many Americans would have to be killed to prompt a massive response by the United States. The bombing of marines in Lebanon, the Oklahoma City bombing, and the downing of Pan Am Flight 103 each resulted in a casualty count of roughly the same magnitude (150–300 deaths). Although these events caused anger and a desire for retaliation among the American public, they prompted no serious call for massive or nuclear retaliation. The body count from a single biological attack could easily be one or two orders of magnitude higher than the casualties caused by these events. Using the rule of proportionality as a guide, one could justifiably debate whether the United States should use massive force in responding to an event that resulted in only a few thousand deaths. However, what if the casualty count was around 300,000? Such an unthinkable result from a single CBW incident is not beyond the realm of possibility: “According to the U.S. Congress Office of Technology Assessment, 100 kg of anthrax spores delivered by an efficient aerosol generator on a large urban target would be between two and six times as lethal as a one megaton thermo-nuclear bomb.”46 Would the deaths of 300,000 Americans be enough to trigger a nuclear response? In this case, proportionality does not rule out the use of nuclear weapons. Besides simply the total number of casualties, the types of casualties- predominantly military versus civilian- will also affect the nature and scope of the US reprisal action. Military combat entails known risks, and the emotions resulting from a significant number of military casualties are not likely to be as forceful as they would be if the attack were against civilians. World War II provides perhaps the best examples for the kind of event or circumstance that would have to take place to trigger a nuclear response. A CBW event that produced a shock and death toll roughly equivalent to those arising from the attack on Pearl Harbor might be sufficient to prompt a nuclear retaliation. President Harry Truman’s decision to drop atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki- based upon a calculation that up to one million casualties might be incurred in an invasion of the Japanese homeland47- is an example of the kind of thought process that would have to occur prior to a nuclear response to a CBW event. Victor Utgoff suggests that “if nuclear retaliation is seen at the time to offer the best prospects for suppressing further CB attacks and speeding the defeat of the aggressor, and if the original attacks had caused severe damage that had outraged American or allied publics, nuclear retaliation would be more than just a possibility, whatever promises had been made.</span><br />

<span class="underline0">Nuclear deterrence is a leading U.S. strategy to counter threats of biological and chemical warfare. The U.S. has adopted a nuclear weapons use doctrine based on the principles of deterrence capacity and the pre-emptive destruction of chemical or biological weapons and facilities of an enemy nation or non-state actor. This policy was most recently updated in Presidential Decision Directive 60 (PDD60), which was signed by President Clinton in late 1997. This document confirmed a policy that was in place as early as 1994. Detailed scenarios for nuclear operations by forces in the European theater (from where, for example, an assault on Libya would be launched) were enshrined in a &quot;Silver Book&quot; in 1994. Planning for this eventuality had begun as early as 1990, when the Pentagon began searching for new missions to justify the retention of nuclear forces following the end of the cold war. The policy now in place allows for nuclear weapons to be used in response to a chemical or biological weapons attack; against facilities for chemical and biological weapons (CBW) production or storage; or against an enemy thought to be preparing a CBW attack. This is part of a policy called counterproliferation, a military response to the spread of weapons of mass destruction (WMD). There is strong pressure from the Department of Energy weapons labs, from some officials in the administration, and a small number of military personnel for the development of new, smaller nuclear weapons that could be used for such counterproliferation missions. If the U.S. suffers a large number of casualties in a biological attack, the probability of nuclear retaliation would be high. If the administration would declare, for example, that the recent anthrax attacks were criminal or terrorist actions and could then trace them back to the bin Laden network, this would permit U.S. forces to attack Afghanistan with nuclear weapons, if a target requiring nuclear weapons to destroy it could be found. The same would be true with Iraq. If the U.S. suffers a large number of casualties in a biological attack, the probability of nuclear retaliation would be high. The problems with this strategy are manifold: First, if the country hosting the WMD terrorists is a non-nuclear weapon state, then the U.S. has promised not to use nuclear weapons against it unless it attacks the U.S. in alliance with a nuclear weapon state. In the case of Africa, South America, and other nuclear weapon free zones (NWFZ), those promises are legally enshrined in protocols to NWFZ treaties--the U.S. action would therefore be illegal. Second, the human and environmental cost of such action across generations would far exceed any damage done to the U.S., and there would be no way to ensure that fallout would be contained within the country attacked. Third, the development of new nuclear weapons would likely require a return to nuclear testing, killing any chance that the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) could come into force, and probably spurring new weapons developments in China, India, and Pakistan. Finally, there is no support for this U.S. policy, even among U.S. allies. NATO has adopted a watered-down version of the U.S. nuclear doctrine, but has been unable to agree on any guidance for military planners to operationalize the policy. Using nuclear weapons would make the U.S. a pariah state. </span><br />

<span class="underline0">2. H-2B Workers Often Fill Spots that American Workers Are Not Likely to Take Claims that H-2B workers take U.S. jobs away from willing American workers ignore key realities: H-2B-eligible work is usually seasonal and sometimes involves unglamorous and strenuous labor.[150] For example, the seasonal nature of hospitality and tourism-based work in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, highlights the need for a temporary labor force that logically must come from foreign sources.[151] As South Carolina’s Hospitality Association president explained, As the areas of our state that attract the most tourists have low residential populations as compared to the size of the community during peak tourism season, there are not enough local residents, or people willing to drive some distance to fill the jobs needed to help grow the state’s No. 1 industry, let alone sustain it.[152] Similarly, the general manager of a resort near Marble Falls, Texas, pointed out, “â€˜We’re in a rural area . . . . We have a tough time finding workers out here. It would be pretty near impossible to run this business’ without the H-2Bs.”[153] Furthermore, the nature of the work often turns away American workers. One employer said that he “tried hiring [Americans] from felony release programs, talking with temp agencies, paying all kinds of salaries. (People literally show up one day, take a look, and say I’m not doing this.)”[154] Likewise, Harry Phillips, who owns Russell Hall Seafood in Maryland, said of his employees, “We have American people in the offices, we hire a lot of American people, but we can’t find American people to pick crabs.”[155] 3. Evidence Has Demonstrated When Employers Cannot Access H-2B Workers, They Are Inclined to Turn to Undocumented Workers Reports that some employers bring on undocumented workers when efforts to access H-2B workers fail highlights that illegal aliens ”not H-2B workers” are most detrimental to American workers, and highlights the importance of enacting Senator Mikulski’s cap exemption provision. The National Foundation for American Policy (“NFAP”) has reported that employers who are shut out of participating in the H-2B program tend to turn to undocumented workers to fill their labor needs.[156] NFAP emphasized that “[i]t would seem naive to think that denying U.S. employers access to H-2B visa holders will result in a massive increase in hiring native-born U.S. workers. In fact, it is likely that the absence of legal temporary workers will mean more illegal immigration.”[157] In response to criticism that H-2B workers harm American workers by artificially lowering wages, NFAP has indicated it is not H-2B workers who negatively impact earnings, but illegal workers: “Reliable data show that legal workers command higher salaries than those here illegally. In other words, preventing businesses from hiring H-2B workers will logically mean more competition for natives with illegal immigrants who possess less bargaining power and earn lower wages than H-2B workers.”[158] NFAP has pointed out that employers must pay H-2B workers prevailing wages for their position the same wages to which similarly employed American workers are entitled, whereas undocumented workers, obviously, have no such express protections.[159] Reports that employers likely turn to undocumented workers to meet labor needs when they cannot access the H-2B program underscore the danger of capping the number of annually available H-2B visas at an arbitrarily low figure. NFAP’s findings unambiguously show that many illegal immigrants have been found to hold jobs that are often occupied by H-2B visa holders, and because the “occupations are generally common to illegal immigrants, this . . . demonstrate[s] that blocking the entry of additional workers on H-2B visas is more likely to increase the use of unauthorized workers.”[160] In fact, under comprehensive immigration reform proposals considered in Congress in 2007 such as the new Y-visa program, the number of legal temporary workers permitted annually would have been increased significantly to approximately half a million.[161] The nearly ten-fold increase “would not be additions to the population; they would be the same migrants who are arriving today illegally. â€˜It sounds like a large number, but that’s because we’d be counting them instead of pretending that they’re not here,’” Deborah Meyers, a senior analyst with the Migration Policy Institute, told the San Francisco Chronicle.[162] In the absence of any comprehensive panacea to the H-2B program, however, Senator Mikulski’s proposed cap exemption serves as a suitable palliative. As NFAP’s findings have demonstrated, setting the number of available H-2B visas too low encourages employers to circumvent the system. As recent years have demonstrated, each fiscal year employers immediately snap up the 66,000 available H-2B visas, leaving many other employers who have been certified by DOL as eligible to host H-2B workers with no opportunity to access the program.[163] For instance, because Senator Mikulski’s returning worker cap exemption has not yet been re-approved, USCIS announced on January 3, 2008, that all visas for the period from April to October 2008 were taken.[164] In years where the exemption was in effect, however, more employers were able to access the program. For the period from April to October 2006, USCIS accepted visa applications until April 4, 2006;[165] from April to October 2007, USCIS accepted visa applications until March 16, 2007.[166] Therefore, with some employers’ needs covered under the exemption for returning workers, the H-2B program was able to support additional employers, almost certainly helping to alleviate some of their labor needs, and thereby preventing them from turning to alternative potentially illegal sources of available labor to keep their businesses afloat. Yet, because Congress has failed to renew Senator Mikulski’s cap exemption provision for FY 2008, once again countless employers have been shut out from the H-2B program because their labor needs are still more than four months away. Many such businesses cannot survive without the foreign laborers upon whom they have become dependent, and those that can survive face certain losses. Denied congressional assistance via Senator Mikulski’s provision, and backed into a corner with seemingly no other options, it seems certain that at least some employers’ survival instincts will lead them to consider using undocumented workers. </span><br />

The arrests of 389 Agriprocessors workers and the tearing apart of their families, followed by criminal charges against plant supervisors, including former top executive Sholom Rubashkin, plunged the town's leading employer into bankruptcy and a shutdown that put hundreds more employees out of work. &quot;Drive down main street, and you'll see the condition of Postville.

 There is one clear distinction between portable and non-portable visas – it’s whether the employer can control the rights of workers to be here or not<br />
Bauer ‘9 (Mary, Director, Immigrant Justice Project of the Southern Poverty Law Center, House Domestic Policy Subcommittee of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, April 23, “The Department of Labor Fiscal Year 2010 Budget and Priorities for Enforcing the Rights of Guest Workers”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/news/splc-to-congress-protect-h-2b-guestworkers-enforce-labor-laws-aggressively/testimo" rel="nofollow">http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/news/splc-to-congress-protect-h-2b-guestworkers-enforce-labor-laws-aggressively/testimo</a>),<br />
Congress should make the H-2B visa portable to other employers, at least under some circumstances. For example, Congress should create a means by which workers may obtain visas when they need to remain in or return to the U.S. to enforce their rights. Employers control right of workers to be here. That means when workers bring suit, or file a workers compensation claim, the employers have extraordinary control over that process. In one case in which I was involved, our named plaintiff in a class action was turned down for a visa to come to the U.S. to testify at his noticed deposition — this despite the fact that he had been repeatedly approved for an H-2B visa when an employer requested it. This leads to the conclusion that there are different standards in place when employers seek workers than when workers seek justice. Congress should remedy that disparity.<br />
Employers won’t hire H-2 workers without this control – turns the case<br />

He says businesses look for foreign workers to fill lower-tier jobs for two main reasons. &quot;Employers in the U.S. have some serious reservations about the pool of unemployed labor in this country,&quot; he says. &quot;Depending on the industry, and what employers are looking for, certain employers harbor prejudices, in terms of workers' expectations on benefits and pay, as well as the American work ethic. &quot;Some employers look overseas and see a ripe opportunity to bring in workers who would bring a different attitude than a U.S. worker and perhaps less expectations,&quot; Seminara says. Another reason, he says, is that such individuals have few rights. &quot;They don't have the right to change jobs,&quot; he says. &quot;If you quit your job on an H-2B visa, the employer is required to report them to [the Department of] Homeland Security. Their status in the country is tied to the job, so they're pretty reliable, in terms of no sick days, no vacation days. If they do not work, then they lose their legal status in this country.&quot; Exacerbating the problem, he says, is that the majority of the guest workers brought into the country do not speak any English, and the vast majority of them do not have a college or, even, a high-school education. &quot;These companies are recruiting people who are very susceptible to being tricked,&quot; he says. &quot;They're not sophisticated people; they want to believe that they're going to get everything that they're being offered.&quot;<br />

The other side of the H-2 visa coin is the non-agricultural H-2B visa. This subcategory of visas is a catchall for industries that are not related to agriculture. n53 It includes &quot;seafood, landscaping, housekeeping, construction, and tree planting.&quot; n54 An endemic problem within the H-2B visa category is that employers search far and wide for workers to fill the gaps in their work force, and in order to entice these workers from across the globe, many outrageous and exaggerated promises are made on the part [*530] of the employers. n55 For example, many potential workers are promised &quot;high wages, overtime, and green cards.&quot; n56 It is not hard to guess that these promises are rarely, if ever, kept. Despite the protections in place, there are still abuses of guest workers in agricultural industries, and there seems to be a very limited path for legal recourse regarding non-agricultural guest workers that enter with an H-2B visa. One analyst suggests strongly that &quot;regulations for H-2B workers ... readily demonstrates the degree to which the H-2B program lacks fundamental legal protections that are at least theoretically available to H-2A workers.&quot; n57<br />

Advantage 1: Asia<br />
US-Asian cooperation has transitioned from security to economic cooperation – the U.S. risks losing its credibility<br />
Feigenbaum 10 [Evan A. Feigenbaum, “Challenge of a changing Asia”, Business Standard, 9-6-2010]<br />
It’s been a rough six months in East Asia, as tensions ratchet up in Korea, navies drill, and governments, from China to Vietnam, trade barbs, claims and counterclaims to the South China Sea. But even as anxieties grow, it is economics, not security, that still defines the essential strategic reality of Asia today: China is fast becoming the central player in a new economic regionalism. And as economic integration tightens, the US and India risk being left out. For its part, the US has endured decades of loose talk about American “decline” in Asia. But in the months since North Korea torpedoed a South Korean naval corvette in March, America’s security role has been strongly reinforced. Yet, ironically, that’s part of the problem: Even as America’s security role remains the backbone of strategic stability, the economic pillars of US credibility are eroding across Asia. In the postwar period, US leadership in Asia depended not just on alliances, bases and carrier battle groups. It flowed, too, from a sustained commitment to three economic pillars: market openness, faith in America’s own competitiveness and strong US leadership on international trade agreements and regimes. But all three pillars are now under fierce attack in the US. And this both compounds and further contributes to a rapid erosion of American economic influence, as China becomes the central player in a growing web of trade and financial connections. Take Southeast Asia. From 2000 to 2009, China’s share of Asean’s total trade increased threefold, surpassing that of the US, whose share declined by a third in the same period. Meanwhile, when the dust settles from the current financial crisis, the character of economic globalisation may be significantly changed with respect to capital flows, production chains and trade patterns. Asian countries are moving forward together in various ways — on trade, financial arrangements, technical standards and investment rules. And increasingly, they are moving forward on a pan-Asian basis and without Washington. This is precisely why American strategy in Asia is simply not sustainable with the kind of trade policy Washington has presently. For generations, deep trade and investment relationships have been the tangible representation of US economic weight in Asia, reflecting a widespread faith in the future economic and strategic strength of the US. This was true in the 19th century, when fast-sailing clipper ships first vaulted America into a role that spanned China, India and the waters betwixt and between. It remains true today. The good news is that US President Barack Obama’s November visit to Seoul has given Washington strong incentives to complete the Korea-US Free Trade Agreement this fall. But there is virtually no prospect that the US will keep pace with Beijing’s burgeoning trade and investment initiatives. And across Asia, anxieties persist about America’s own economic prospects: the scope and nature of its recovery from the financial crisis; its commitment to stave off protectionist sentiment; and whether it can muster a bipartisan political consensus to manage its debts. This offers a cautionary tale for India. Strategically, India has been bottled up in the subcontinent for generations, but it wasn’t always so: Southeast Asia bears the hallmarks of a bygone era in names like “Indonesia” and “Indochina”, and Indian sailors once plied the trade routes from the Indian Ocean to the Strait of Malacca. But as it again “looks East”, India risks being left out in Asia because of the significant mismatch between its lofty strategic goals and more earthbound economic realities. Make no mistake, India’s strategic connections to East Asia are being restored. Yet, this is happening, in large part, because India is widely viewed as a potential — if still very modest — counterbalance to Chinese power. Diplomacy and politics remain the central drivers, not least, for example, in the invitation to India to become a more active player in East Asian regional groups. But, at the end of the day, strategic intentions alone cannot sustain a larger role for India in Asia writ large. As America is rediscovering, economic content is essential. Greater economic content to India’s relations with East Asia will be required. And, investment-related reforms will surely be essential, too, to enhance the flow of goods, capital and opportunity. Trade plays a growing role in the Indian economy, and India has signed preferential trade agreements with Asean and South Korea. Yet, scale remains a handicap: 11.6 per cent of Asean’s trade is with China, just 2.5 per cent with India. Meanwhile, the backbone of East Asian economies remains integrated supply and production chains to which India is largely irrelevant. More manufacturing in India’s southern states could mean greater integration into East Asian supply and production chains, or not. Likewise with outbound investment from corporate India: it could, perhaps, transform India’s interactions with Southeast Asia; but, here too, scale remains a handicap. The business of Asia is still business. And India and East Asia have some distance yet to travel.<br />
And, U.S.-Asian economic ties are founded by immigration<br />
Yang 10 [Philip Q. Yang, “A Theory of Asian Immigration to the United States”, Journal of Asian American Studies, Vol. 13, No. 1, February 2010]<br />
However, mere cross-country disparities will not automatically cause migration, and they only serve as potential motivators for migration. There must be forces that initiate migration and forces that sustain it. These initiating and perpetuating forces entail connections at both the macro and micro levels. At the macro level, there must be cross-national connections between sending and receiving countries. In fact, intercountry connections can be conceptualized as a network of countries linked by interactions.61 In the case of Asian immigration to the United States, U.S. involvement in Asian sending countries acts to establish U.S.-Asia ties. U.S. involvement creates a large conducive social environment that makes immigration possible or likely to occur. It helps activate the effect of disparities between the Asian countries and the United States, and it [End Page 18] causes the formation of a pool of potential migrants and the emergence of emigration as an actual option. The higher the level of U.S. involvement in Asian countries, the higher the level of immigration to the United States, ceteris paribus. This is the essence of world system theory.62 Intercountry connections could be economic, military, political, or cultural. Each dimension of these connections or involvements affects immigration to the United States through specific mechanisms. The most common form of U.S.-Asia connections is U.S. economic involvement in Asian countries. U.S. economic involvement includes U.S trade with Asian countries, U.S. direct investment in Asian countries, establishment of U.S.-owned factories in Asia, operation of U.S. transnational corporations in Asia, training of Asian management and technical personnel in the United States or in Asia, and so forth. U.S. economic involvement displaces people from traditional economies and creates an emigrant pool; it heightens potential migrants' awareness of the disparities between the United States and their own country; and it consolidates the objective and ideological linkages with the receiving country.63 Through these mechanisms, U.S. economic involvement becomes a factor pushing Asians to leave their homelands and pulling them to the United States. The effects of U.S. economic involvements on Asian immigration before World War II were well documented in Cheng and Bonacich's 1984 volume.64 The Western powers, including the United States, imposed unequal treaties concerning trade, tariffs, and labor flow on all the Asian countries; shook slack Asians from their traditional economic base, rendering them available for labor recruitment; and actively recruited Asians for migration to the U.S. Pacific Coast and Hawaii as cheap labor to meet the labor demand. The impact of U.S. economic involvement on new Asian immigration after World War II was analyzed by Ong, Bonacich, and Cheng in 1994 and needs more documentation.65 But one basic fact is that major Asian sending countries in the post-1965 period all have close economic ties with the United States.<br />
Continuing to bring in immigrant entrepreneurs is key to developing that economic integration<br />
Saxenian 00 [AnnaLee Saxenian, “Silicon Valley’s New Immigrant Entrepreneurs”, University of California, Santa Cruz, The Center for Comparative Immigration Studies, 2000]<br />
At the same time that Silicon Valley's immigrant entrepreneurs organized local professional networks, they were also building ties back to their home countries. The region's Chinese engineers constructed a vibrant two-way bridge connecting the technology communities in Silicon Valley and Taiwan; their Indian counterparts became key middlemen linking U.S. businesses to low-cost software expertise in India. These cross-Pacific networks represent more than an additional &quot;ethnic resource&quot; that supports entrepreneurial success; rather, they provide the region's skilled immigrants with an important advantage over their mainstream competitors who often lack the language skills, cultural know-how, and contacts to build business relationships in Asia. The traditional image of the immigrant economy is the isolated Chinatown or &quot;ethnic enclave&quot; with limited ties to the outside economy. Silicon Valley's new immigrant entrepreneurs, by contrast, are increasingly building professional and social networks that span national boundaries and facilitate flows of capital, skill, and technology. In so doing, they are creating transnational communities that provide the shared information, contacts, and trust that allow local producers to participate in an increasingly global economy (Portes, 1996). As recently as the 1970s, only very large corporations had the resources and capabilities to grow internationally, and they did so primarily by establishing marketing offices or manufacturing plants overseas. Today, by contrast, new transportation and communications technologies allow even the smallest firms to build partnerships with foreign producers to tap overseas expertise, cost-savings, and markets. Start-ups in Silicon Valley today are often global actors from the day they begin operations: Many raise capital from Asian sources, others subcontract manufacturing to Taiwan or rely on software development in India, and virtually all sell their products in Asian markets. The scarce resource in this new environment is the ability to locate foreign partners quickly and to manage complex business relationships across cultural and linguistic boundaries. This is particularly a challenge in high-technology industries in which products, markets, and technologies are continually being redefined--and where product cycles are routinely shorter than nine months. First-generation immigrants, like the Chinese and Indian engineers of Silicon Valley, who have the language, cultural, and technical skills to function well in both the United States and foreign markets are distinctly positioned to play a central role in this environment. They are creating social structures that enable even the smallest producers to locate and maintain mutually beneficial collaborations across long distances and that facilitate access to Asian sources of capital, manufacturing capabilities, skills, and markets. These ties have measurable economic benefits. Research at the University of California at Berkeley has documented a significant correlation between the presence of first-generation immigrants from a given country and exports from California. For example, every 1 percent increase in the number of first-generation immigrants from a given country, exports from California go up nearly 0.5 percent. Moreover, this effect is especially pronounced in the Asia-Pacific region where, all other things being equal, California exports nearly four times more than it exports to comparable countries in other parts of the world (Bardhan and Howe, 1998). This section presents cases of immigrant entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley who have helped to construct the new transnational (and typically trans-local) networks. The region's Taiwanese engineers have forged close social and economic ties to their counterparts in the Hsinchu region of Taiwan--the area, comparable in size to Silicon Valley, that extends from Taipei to the Hsinchu Science-Based Industrial Park. They have created a rich fabric of professional and business relationships that supports a two-way process of reciprocal industrial upgrading. Silicon Valley's Indian engineers, by contrast, play a more arm's-length role as middlemen linking U.S.-based companies with low-cost software expertise in localities like Bangalore and Hyderabad. In both cases, the immigrant engineers provide the critical contacts, information, and cultural know-how that link dynamic--but distant--regions in the global economy.<br />
US leadership in Asia prevents multiple nuclear wars<br />

In Asia, as in Europe, unease with America’s overwhelming global dominance is high. But Asia is more keenly aware than Europe of the vital role that the U.S. plays in maintaining global stability. No matter what their misgivings, only a few Asian countries, and certainly no major U.S. ally, opposed the U.S. on Iraq. There is a clearer appreciation in Asia than in Europe that the fundamental issue in Iraq now is the credibility and resolve of the U.S.. This is because Asia still faces many serious security challenges. Kashmir, North Korea and cross-strait relations between Beijing and Taipei are potential flashpoints. If things go terribly wrong, the conflicts could even turn nuclear. The U.S. is central to the management of all three potential flashpoints. All three conflicts also have a direct impact on the global struggle against terrorism. Let me conclude therefore with a few words on each. Potential Flashpoints in Asia The India-Pakistan dispute over Kashmir is a longstanding one, difficult to resolve because of religion and history. If a conflict breaks out, it is not difficult to imagine Kashmir becoming a new theatre for jihad and a fertile ground for breeding terrorists. But India and Pakistan know that a conflict over Kashmir will have devastating consequences for each other and the entire South Asian region. The U.S. holds the ring. The desire of both Islamabad and New Delhi to maintain good relations with the U.S. gives Washington leverage that it exercised in 2001 to avert a possible nuclear war. 31 North Korea is another potential trouble spot. The terrorists could try to exploit the situation to acquire materials for WMD. Fortunately, the six-party talks have lowered tensions and the issue is being managed. Whatever their differences, the key actors share a common interest in the peaceful containment of the issue. I have been told by several leaders who have met Kim Jong Il that he is a rational, well-informed man who calculates his moves. He must know that an outbreak of conflict with the US will lead to the very outcome that he fears most: regime change or even the disappearance of North Korea as a sovereign state. He may go to the brink but not step over the edge. The credibility of the US military option is vital to maintaining peace. 32 The dangers of miscalculation are highest over Taiwan. The issue is extremely complex because it involves the domestic politics of China, the US and Taiwan and relations between the three parties. Economic forces are integrating Taiwan with the Mainland but this trend conflicts with Taiwan's desire for a separate identity. Chen Shui-bian's inauguration speech took a conciliatory tone. He must have taken into account US concerns about maintaining stability in cross-strait relations. But he did not renounce independence. Yet independence for Taiwan is a non-starter. No Asian, and I believe, no European government, would recognise Taiwan's independence. To do so would earn China's permanent enmity. And China is the economic story of this century. No Chinese leadership can lose Taiwan and still survive. If Taiwan pushes beyond a certain red line, the Chinese leaders must respond or be rejected by their people. The result will be war and a permanent rise in Chinese nationalism and hostility. 33 The consequences of such a war will make Iraq seem a small problem. The US has no reasons to open another front with China over Taiwan, given its strategic priorities in Iraq, the Middle East and the global fight against terrorism. Indeed, President Bush has stated explicitly that he does not support Taiwan's independence. He has also publicly stated that the US opposes any unilateral action by either China or Taiwan to change the status quo. Still, the likelihood of the US being drawn into a cross-strait conflict is there if wrong signals are emitted by the US. Should such a conflict arise, China might not prevail; at least not in the first round. China's physical infrastructure would be damaged and economic development set back many decades. But the Chinese leaders have said that they would be prepared to pay this price and more. Taiwan, however, would be physically and economically devastated. Investor confidence in Taiwan would be shattered. The economy will go downhill, and not recover for a long time. If the Taiwanese know that this will be the outcome, they may pause to ask whether this price is worth paying for a bid for independence.<br />
Advantage 2: Entrepreneurial capitalism<br />
Status quo visa laws towards immigrant investors are crushing the ability of immigrant entrepreneurs to come to the United States to start companies<br />

We write to express our support for the Startup Visa. Since the founding of our country, the entrepreneurial spirit has been a defining characteristic of the United States. Today we are the world leader in creating new enterprises, advancing innovation, and creating jobs as a result of this entrepreneurial activity. Fast-growing companies have long been the main source of new jobs and innovation in the United States. However, in recent years our visa laws have made it unnecessarily difficult for immigrants to launch new companies here. We view this as a major competitive disadvantage for our country in the 21st century. Companies such as Google, Pfizer, Intel, Yahoo, DuPont, eBay and Procter &amp; Gamble are all former start-ups founded by immigrants. Yet immigrants have not only founded major, well-known companies. Foreign-born residents made up just 12.5% of the U.S. population in 2008, while nearly 40% of technology company founders and 52% of founders of companies in Silicon Valley are foreign-born. As venture capitalists and angel investors, we often fund companies at their very inception. In cases where there are immigrant founders, it is often impossible for them to get an appropriate visa to stay in the United States and start their company. Even in cases where the founders already have a visa of some sort, they typically can't use this visa to start a company. As a result, they often have to leave our country to start their company, resulting in a loss of innovative entrepreneurs and the correspondingly created jobs in the United States. There are multiple costs to our country and our economy. First, we lose the entrepreneur, who is a critical part of our society. We then lose the jobs that are created by the new venture, which in the success case could easily number in hundreds or thousands over the first decade of the company's life. Finally, we run the risk of losing our reputation as the greatest country in which to start a company. To address this issue, we support the Startup Visa proposal. Early stage companies are often started with funding of at least $250,000. In these situations, if a qualified U.S. venture capital investor or a U.S. &quot;super angel&quot; (an angel investor that has a track record of regularly participating in seed round investments) is willing to commit a significant investment for a foreign entrepreneur to start a company in the United States, we believe the entrepreneur should be able to get a &quot;Startup Visa.&quot; We believe these thresholds are appropriate for creating credible startups which, if successful, can lead to numerous U.S. based jobs. Vanilla (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.vanillaforums.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.vanillaforums.com</a>) is an example of a type of company this visa would apply to. Vanilla has two founders, both Canadian. They spent the summer in Boulder, Colorado as part of the TechStars accelerator program getting advice, help, and mentorship from over 50 U.S. based entrepreneurs and investors. Numerous investors were interested in funding Vanilla and helping them to grow their company from Boulder; however neither founder was able to give investors comfort that they could get an appropriate visa to stay and work in the US. Since then, the founders have relocated to Montreal, raised $500,000, and started their company in Canada. Today, they are adding three people to their team, all based in Montreal. If successful, they will add many more people to the team over the next few years. Each year thousands of foreign entrepreneurs face the same situation that the Vanilla founders faced. All of these entrepreneurs are starting companies with high growth potential where they could be hiring tens or hundreds of employees over the first few years of their company's existence. When Google first started, it was two founders and an idea - today it is one of the most important companies in the world. This is the type of company the Startup Visa proposal is addressing. The U.S. remains one of the most attractive countries for entrepreneurs. It has a culture of risk taking, capital formation, and an economic dynamism that is the envy of the world. This gives us a competitive edge that we should not let slip through our fingers.<br />

That kills our economic model<br />

First, throughout our history we've relied on foreign-born entrepreneurs to help spur economic growth. Nationwide, about a quarter of our technology companies have been founded by immigrants. Here in Massachusetts, some of our most notable tech giants were created by brilliant, visionary immigrants like An Wang of Wang Laboratories, Desh Deshpande of Sycamore Networks, and Ash Dahod, who recently sold Starent Networks to Cisco for nearly three billion dollars. Second, now more than ever, our foreign-born students can return to their home countries to find opportunity. A recent study found that 52 percent of the Chinese students attending U.S. colleges and universities believed they would find greater opportunities if they returned home after graduation. With some 445K students currently enrolled at Massachusetts colleges and universities, we naturally have one of the nation's largest pools of foreign-born students, a disproportionate talent asset that, in turn, can create tremendous innovation and wealth in our Commonwealth. We need to retain every one of those students who is willing to strike out on his or her own to start a company and create new jobs and wealth in our Commonwealth. We believe this tradition of great foreign-born entrepreneurs starting companies and hiring here must be maintained and nurtured if we are to succeed in an increasingly competitive world. As connectivity and talent have become globally available commodities, the barriers that foreign-born entrepreneurs face when starting businesses outside the United States have all but disappeared. To maintain our leadership position, we need the best entrepreneurs -- domestic and foreign-born -- to stay here and build tomorrow's leading technology companies in the Commonwealth.<br />
U.S. economic leadership is key to global capitalism and economic cooperation – all alternatives destroy cooperation<br />
Posen ‘9 (Adam, Deputy director and senior fellow of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, “Economic leadership beyond the crisis,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://clients.squareeye.com/uploads/foresight/documents/PN%20USA_FINAL_LR_1.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://clients.squareeye.com/uploads/foresight/documents/PN%20USA_FINAL_LR_1.pdf</a>)<br />
In the postwar period, US power and prestige, beyond the nation's military might, have been based largely on American relative economic size and success. These facts enabled the US to promote economic openness and buy-in to a set of economic institutions, formal and informal, that resulted in increasing international economic integration. With the exception of the immediate post-Bretton Woods oil-shock period (1974-85), this combination produced generally growing prosperity at home and abroad, and underpinned the idea that there were benefits to other countries of following the American model and playing by American rules. Initially this system was most influential and successful in those countries in tight military alliance with the US, such as Canada, West Germany, Japan, South Korea, and the United Kingdom. With the collapse of Soviet communism in 1989, and the concomitant switch of important emerging economies, notably Brazil, China, India, and Mexico, to increasingly free-market capitalism, global integration on American terms through American leadership has been increasingly dominant for the last two decades. The global financial crisis of 2008-09, however, represents a challenge to that world order. While overt financial panic has been averted, and most economic forecasts are for recovery to begin in the US and the major emerging markets well before end of 2009 (a belief I share), there remain significant risks for the US and its leadership. The global financial system, including but not limited to US-based entities, has not yet been sustainably reformed. In fact, financial stability will come under strain again when the current government financial guarantees and public ownership of financial firms and assets are unwound over the next couple of years. The growth rate of the US economy and the ability of the US government to finance responses to future crises, both military and economic, will be meaningfully curtailed for several years to come. Furthermore, the crisis will accelerate at least temporarily two related long-term trends eroding the viability of the current international economic arrangements. First, perhaps inevitably, the economic size and importance of China, India, Brazil, and other emerging markets (including oil-exporters like Russia) has been catching up with the US, and even more so with demographically and productivity challenged Europe and northeast Asia. Second, pressure has been building over the past fifteen years or so of these developing countries' economic rise to give their governments more voice and weight in international economic decision-making. Again, this implies a transfer of relative voting share from the US, but an even greater one from over-represented Western Europe. The near certainty that Brazil, China, and India, are to be less harmed in real economic terms by the current crisis than either the US or most other advanced economies will only emphasise their growing strength, and their ability to claim a role in leadership. The need for capital transfers from China and oil-exporters to fund deficits and bank recapitalisation throughout the West, not just in the US, increases these rising countries' leverage and legitimacy in international economic discussions. One aspect of this particular crisis is that American economic policymakers, both Democratic and Republican, became increasingly infatuated with financial services and innovation beginning in the mid-1990s. This reflected a number of factors, some ideological, some institutional, and some interest group driven. The key point here is that export of financial services and promotion of financial liberalisation on the US securitised model abroad came to dominate the US international economic policy agenda, and thus that of the IMF, the OECD, and the G8 as well. This came to be embodied by American multinational commercial and investment banks, in perception and in practice. That particular version of the American economic model has been widely discredited, because of the crisis' apparent origins in US lax regulation and over-consumption, as well as in excessive faith in American-style financial markets. Thus, American global economic leadership has been eroded over the long-term by the rise of major emerging market economies, disrupted in the short-term by the nature and scope of the financial crisis, and partially discredited by the excessive reliance upon and overselling of US-led financial capitalism. This crisis therefore presents the possibility of the US model for economic development being displaced, not only deservedly tarnished, and the US having limited resources in the near-term to try to respond to that challenge. Additionally, the US' traditional allies and co-capitalists in Western Europe and Northeast Asia have been at least as damaged economically by the crisis (though less damaged reputationally). Is there an alternative economic model? The preceding description would seem to confirm the rise of the Rest over the West. That would be premature. The empirical record is that economic recovery from financial crises, while painful, is doable even by the poorest countries, and in advanced countries rarely leads to significant political dislocation. Even large fiscal debt burdens can be reined in over a few years where political will and institutions allow, and the US has historically fit in that category. A few years of slower growth will be costly, but also may put the US back on a sustainable growth path in terms of savings versus consumption. Though the relative rise of the major emerging markets will be accelerated by the crisis, that acceleration will be insufficient to rapidly close the gap with the US in size, let alone in technology and well-being. None of those countries, except perhaps for China, can think in terms of rivaling the US in all the aspects of national power. These would include: a large, dynamic and open economy; favorable demographic dynamics; monetary stability and a currency with a global role; an ability to project hard power abroad; and an attractive economic model to export for wide emulation. This last point is key. In the area of alternative economic models, one cannot beat something with nothing - communism fell not just because of its internal contradictions, or the costly military build-up, but because capitalism presented a clearly superior alternative. The Chinese model is in part the American capitalist (albeit not high church financial liberalisation) model, and is in part mercantilism. There has been concern that some developing or small countries could take the lesson from China that building up lots of hard currency reserves through undervaluation and export orientation is smart. That would erode globalisation, and lead to greater conflict with and criticism of the US-led system. While in the abstract that is a concern, most emerging markets - and notably Brazil, India, Mexico, South Africa, and South Korea - are not pursuing that extreme line. The recent victory of the incumbent Congress Party in India is one indication, and the statements about openness of Brazilian President Lula is another. Mexico's continued orientation towards NAFTA while seeking other investment flows (outside petroleum sector, admittedly) to and from abroad is a particularly brave example. Germany's and Japan's obvious crisis-prompted difficulties emerging from their very high export dependence, despite their being wealthy, serve as cautionary examples on the other side. So unlike in the1970s, the last time that the US economic performance and leadership were seriously compromised, we will not see leading developing economies like Brazil and India going down the import substitution or other self-destructive and uncooperative paths. If this assessment is correct, the policy challenge is to deal with relative US economic decline, but not outright hostility to the US model or displacement of the current international economic system. That is reassuring, for it leaves us in the realm of normal economic diplomacy, perhaps to be pursued more multilaterally and less high-handedly than the US has done over the past 20 years. It also suggests that adjustment of current international economic institutions is all that is required, rather than desperately defending economic globalisation itself. For all of that reassurance, however, the need to get buy-in from the rising new players to the current system is more pressing on the economic front than it ever has been before. Due to the crisis, the ability of the US and the other advanced industrial democracies to put up money and markets for rewards and side-payments to those new players is also more limited than it has been in the past, and will remain so for at least the next few years. The need for the US to avoid excessive domestic self-absorption is a real concern as well, given the combination of foreign policy fatigue from the Bush foreign policy agenda and economic insecurity from the financial crisis. Managing the post-crisis global economy Thus, the US faces a challenging but not truly threatening global economic situation as a result of the crisis and longer-term financial trends. Failure to act affirmatively to manage the situation, however, bears two significant and related risks: first, that China and perhaps some other rising economic powers will opportunistically divert countries in US-oriented integrated relationships to their economic sphere(s); second, that a leadership vacuum will arise in international financial affairs and in multilateral trade efforts, which will over time erode support for a globally integrated economy. Both of these risks if realised would diminish US foreign policy influence, make the economic system less resilient in response to future shocks (to every country's detriment), reduce economic growth and thus the rate of reduction in global poverty, and conflict with other foreign policy goals like controlling climate change or managing migration and demographic shifts. If the US is to rise to the challenge, it should concentrate on the following priority measures.<br />
Multiple impacts:<br />
The plan allows us to transition to the best form of capitalism<br />

Could the surge in entrepreneurs be just what the country needs to further revive the sluggish U.S. economy? “It’s a key to solving the big problem of huge segments of people who’ve been left behind in this recession,” said John Challenger, chief executive of the Chicago outplacement firm Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas, which tracks workforce and economic trends. “Entrepreneurs may lead the recovery.” On a deeper level, the rise in new business owners also signals an historic shift in what will drive the U.S. economy in the future. Unlike past downturns, this one holds unique peculiarities. For one, many of the industries that helped pull the country out of past recessions — autos and banks — have faced devastating, irreversible problems this go-round and aren’t likely to reprise their roles as labor market saviors. “No way is the recovery going to happen without the increase in entrepreneurs,” said Dane Stangler, research manager at the Kansas City, Mo.-based Kauffman Foundation, one of the world’s largest foundations devoted to entrepreneurship. “In 20 or 30 years, we’re going to look back on this recession, and it will be a mark on the historic timeline where we precisely moved away from old-line industrial capitalism into full-fledged entrepreneurial capitalism.”<br />
Empirically, American entrepreneurial capitalism prevents global war and solves the bad impacts of capitalism<br />
Schramm ‘6 (Carl J., President and Chief Executive Officer of the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, a Batten Fellow at the University of Virginia's Darden Graduate School of Business; and was chairman of the National Advisory, Committee on Measuring Innovation, Department of Commerce, CEO, June 28, 2006, “Capitalism spreads freedom even as democracy falters,” USA Today, p. np)<br />
How would Presidents George Washington, John Quincy Adams or Thomas Jefferson handle Iraq? Afghanistan? The war on terror? The search for global peace? One overlooked &quot;founder&quot; offers enduring answers: Adam Smith. Smith published the Wealth of Nations in 1776, the same year the Continental Congress declared American independence. By the time of the Constitutional Convention 11 years later, his ideas had been incorporated into the thinking of the new nation's leaders. Smith's great revelation was that political freedom would most likely emerge and persist under conditions of economic freedom, what we now call capitalism. Our democratic system as defined in our Constitution incorporated respect for this economic system. Like Smith's invisible hand in the market, the Framers saw an invisible hand in our politics. They believed that, if allowed to work freely, these hands together would shape America into the land where invention, creativity and entrepreneurial activity would flourish. There would be no danger of an aristocracy of wealth because the instruments of financial success were available to every person. In the two centuries since then, Smith's proposition has served to advance all of civilization. America has become the hope of the oppressed, the &quot;mother of exiles&quot; and the cradle of modern commerce. Twice, America considered turning away from economic freedom. In the Depression, nationalization was seriously considered, and Presidents Roosevelt and Truman did attempt to take over several industries. In the late 1970s, in the face of low growth and high inflation, the nation nearly followed the advice of such economists as Harvard's Wassily Leontief and John Kenneth Galbraith to establish government central planning. Instead, in the 1980s, we returned to our origins and bet on individual entrepreneurs rather than on government bureaucrats. The result has been today's extraordinary economic engine — Smith's entrepreneurial capitalism at work. Indeed, research from the University of Maryland and Census Bureau shows that net jobs created by businesses less than five years old exceeded 20% per year during the '80s and '90s (equating to millions of jobs), while jobs created by more mature businesses remained essentially flat. Even so, what do we do now in the face of a new enemy to freedom, driven by a notion that our democratic way should be eliminated? More than the export of democracy, it is the export of entrepreneurial capitalism that can produce a new birth of peace and freedom around our globe. Entrepreneurial capitalism is based on individual invention, and because wealth comes from one's own initiative, it advances human dignity. And here is the good news. Virtually every country, whatever its political system, wants to embrace it. They have seen the success of the American economy. It has been said that when goods cross borders, armies don't. Today, China and India are the world's two largest countries racing toward entrepreneurial capitalism. They are the example and test of that thesis. Several decades ago, their armies clashed. Now no one talks of war, only of their economic emergence. Capitalism has promoted peace and, in China, better -- though still inadequate -- respect for rights. If, with our assistance, Adam Smith's entrepreneurial capitalism were to become ubiquitous, the cross-border investment in the success of our brothers and sisters around the world, and theirs in us, would cause people everywhere to see the futility of ancient struggles, whether based on plunder, conquest or theocratic fervor. In the insight of our invisible founder is the secret for achieving a future of global peace.<br />
Multilateral economic cooperation solves key global threats – especially warming and prolif<br />
Matthews, 07 [Jessica, president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, &quot;Europe and the US: Confronting Global Challenges,&quot; 11/8, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.carnegieendowment.org/files/transcript_mandelson.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.carnegieendowment.org/files/transcript_mandelson.pdf</a>]<br />
Now, the question I want to answer today is, how do we do this and to what purpose? Firstly, fundamentally, we must engage with economic globalization, accept it, shape it. We’re not going to roll it back, and if we could, we shouldn’t seek to do so. In fact, I’d argue that the preservation of an equitable economic globalization should be the core political commitment at the heart of the transatlantic economic relationship, equivalent in its way to the mutual commitment to democracy that the Atlantic Charter embodied six decades ago, because managed right, an economically integrated world is ultimately not only a more stable and a more equitable world; it is also our principal means of meeting the increasing number of global challenges that require collective action. The reshaping of the global economy and the huge dramatic changes that are taking place in the economic landscape of the world certainly test the nerves of us in Europe and the nerves of you too in the United States. But just because it tests our nerves doesn’t mean to say that these changes are not in our interests. It’s true that some parts of our manufacturing sectors are certainly facing some tough competitive pressure. It is true that this will force us to think about how we choose to educate and to train ourselves in the future, and how we ensure that the benefits of economic growth are equitably shared. That’s a major policy challenge for us on both sides of the Atlantic. It is true that because of these great changes and the huge anxiety that they are generating amongst people on both sides of the Atlantic that policymakers are under increasing pressure to show that our embrace of economic globalization is not naivety, that we’re not being taken for a ride, in other words, by the rest of the world; to show that – as we need to do as policymakers – to show that closing the gate to the outside world is not a better alternative to keeping that gate open to the rest of the world. Now, these debates are broadly the same in Europe and the United States. But in an open global market, we have to understand that the growing economies of the developing world are also a competitive stimulus and a real engine for the growth of our own economies. They are a market for our goods and for our investment. They are a source of downward pressure on consumer prices and inflation at home. They are also the driving force that has lifted perhaps half a billion people out of poverty in half a human lifetime, which is hard to argue against. In defending and preserving this openness to the world and this growth of the global economy and its integration, the EU and the U.S. are faced with some simple realities. The first is that we now live in a world that is increasingly economically multi-polar. One billion new workers have entered the global labor force in the space of just two decades in the world. In those 20-odd years, China has risen from a country with which the EU traded almost literally nothing to becoming our biggest trading partner for manufacturers. In some ways, an older balance of economic power is reasserting itself in the world. In 1830, India and China were the two biggest economies in the world – in 1830. By 2050, they will again be amongst the very largest economies in the world. Of course, this is not the only way of weighing power in the modern world, far from it. But it is fundamental. And that’s in the nature of the fundamental revolution in economic terms, and also political terms, therefore, that the world is undergoing. Now, the machinery of what you might call the Atlantic consensus – the World Bank, the IMF, GATT, G7 or G8 – was conceived and rooted in the assumption that the global economic and political order could and would indeed be governed largely by the Atlantic world. That assumption now no longer holds. There has been a reorientation from the Atlantic to the Pacific and beyond. Now, the multilateral institutions that survive, therefore, will be those ones that are able to adapt to this new 21st century landscape. The second simple reality that I would identify for you is that economic globalization means interdependence. This is not simply a question of global supply chains and production lines. Our open markets are a ladder out of poverty for the developing world. Their growing markets are a source of growth for us. That is the fundamental interdependence that links and joins us and our interests together in the global economy. A world of growing prosperity and economic integration is a more stable world, even if it doesn’t always feel that way Now, for that reason, multilateral institutions in the multilateral trading system will matter more than ever in the new global age of the 21st century. There is no going it alone in this century, in this global age. Interdependence doesn’t allow going it alone in the way that we have tried to practice or imagine it was possible in the past. Our ability to get things done multilaterally will define the extent to which we can shape globalization in a way that makes it equitable and sustainable and binds in the big new players who are emerging in that global economy. It will certainly define the extent to which we can confront huge pressing problems such as global warming, migration, nuclear proliferation, and energy security.<br />
Warming is real, anthropogenic, and the largest risk of extinction<br />
Deibel ‘7 (Terry L. Deibel, professor of IR at National War College, Foreign Affairs Strategy, “Conclusion: American Foreign Affairs Strategy Today Anthropogenic – caused by CO2”)<br />
Finally, there is one major existential threat to American security (as well as prosperity) of a nonviolent nature, which, though far in the future, demands urgent action. It is the threat of global warming to the stability of the climate upon which all earthly life depends. Scientists worldwide have been observing the gathering of this threat for three decades now, and what was once a mere possibility has passed through probability to near certainty. Indeed not one of more than 900 articles on climate change published in refereed scientific journals from 1993 to 2003 doubted that anthropogenic warming is occurring. “In legitimate scientific circles,” writes Elizabeth Kolbert, “it is virtually impossible to find evidence of disagreement over the fundamentals of global warming.” Evidence from a vast international scientific monitoring effort accumulates almost weekly, as this sample of newspaper reports shows: an international panel predicts “brutal droughts, floods and violent storms across the planet over the next century”; climate change could “literally alter ocean currents, wipe away huge portions of Alpine Snowcaps and aid the spread of cholera and malaria”; “glaciers in the Antarctic and in Greenland are melting much faster than expected, and…worldwide, plants are blooming several days earlier than a decade ago”; “rising sea temperatures have been accompanied by a significant global increase in the most destructive hurricanes”; “NASA scientists have concluded from direct temperature measurements that 2005 was the hottest year on record, with 1998 a close second”; “Earth’s warming climate is estimated to contribute to more than 150,000 deaths and 5 million illnesses each year” as disease spreads; “widespread bleaching from Texas to Trinidad…killed broad swaths of corals” due to a 2-degree rise in sea temperatures. “The world is slowly disintegrating,” concluded Inuit hunter Noah Metuq, who lives 30 miles from the Arctic Circle. “They call it climate change…but we just call it breaking up.” From the founding of the first cities some 6,000 years ago until the beginning of the industrial revolution, carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere remained relatively constant at about 280 parts per million (ppm). At present they are accelerating toward 400 ppm, and by 2050 they will reach 500 ppm, about double pre-industrial levels. Unfortunately, atmospheric CO2 lasts about a century, so there is no way immediately to reduce levels, only to slow their increase, we are thus in for significant global warming; the only debate is how much and how serous the effects will be. As the newspaper stories quoted above show, we are already experiencing the effects of 1-2 degree warming in more violent storms, spread of disease, mass die offs of plants and animals, species extinction, and threatened inundation of low-lying countries like the Pacific nation of Kiribati and the Netherlands at a warming of 5 degrees or less the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets could disintegrate, leading to a sea level of rise of 20 feet that would cover North Carolina’s outer banks, swamp the southern third of Florida, and inundate Manhattan up to the middle of Greenwich Village. Another catastrophic effect would be the collapse of the Atlantic thermohaline circulation that keeps the winter weather in Europe far warmer than its latitude would otherwise allow. Economist William Cline once estimated the damage to the United States alone from moderate levels of warming at 1-6 percent of GDP annually; severe warming could cost 13-26 percent of GDP. But the most frightening scenario is runaway greenhouse warming, based on positive feedback from the buildup of water vapor in the atmosphere that is both caused by and causes hotter surface temperatures. Past ice age transitions, associated with only 5-10 degree changes in average global temperatures, took place in just decades, even though no one was then pouring ever-increasing amounts of carbon into the atmosphere. Faced with this specter, the best one can conclude is that “humankind’s continuing enhancement of the natural greenhouse effect is akin to playing Russian roulette with the earth’s climate and humanity’s life support system. At worst, says physics professor Marty Hoffert of New York University, “we’re just going to burn everything up; we’re going to het the atmosphere to the temperature it was in the Cretaceous when there were crocodiles at the poles, and then everything will collapse.” During the Cold War, astronomer Carl Sagan popularized a theory of nuclear winter to describe how a thermonuclear war between the Untied States and the Soviet Union would not only destroy both countries but possible end life on this planet. Global warming is the post-Cold War era’s equivalent of nuclear winter at least as serious and considerably better supported scientifically. Over the long run it puts dangers form terrorism and traditional military challenges to shame. It is a threat not only to the security and prosperity to the United States, but potentially to the continued existence of life on this planet.<br />
Growth will become sustainable if we keep growing – tech innovations and population levels will change the identity of industrial civilization<br />
Barker ‘00 (Brent, electrical engineer, and manager of corporate communications for the Electric Power Research Institute and former industrial economist and staff author at SRI International and as a commercial research analyst at USX Corporation, “Technology and the Quest for Sustainability.” EPRI Journal, Summer, infotrac)<br />
In the twenty-first century, industrial processes will be revolutionized by new electrotechnologies, including lasers, plasmas, microwaves, and electron beams for materials processing, as well as electrochemical synthesis and electroseparation for chemical processing. Manufacturing will be revolutionized by a host of emerging technology platforms--for example, nanotechnology, biotechnology, biomimetics, high-temperature superconductivity, and network technology including the combining of advanced sensors with information technology to create adaptive, intelligent systems and processes. Future industrial facilities using advanced network technologies will be operated in new ways to simultaneously optimize productivity energy use, materials consumption, and plant emissions. Optimization will extend beyond the immediate facility to webs of facilities supporting industrial and urban ecology with the waste of one stream becoming the feedstock of the next. In the aggregate, the penetration of all the emerging technologies into the global economy should make it possible to sustain industrial productivity growth rates above 2% per year for many decades. The same technology platforms will be used to improve the efficiency of land, energy and water use, For example, distributed sensors and controls that enable precision farming can improve crop yields and reduce land and water use. And doubling or even tripling global energy efficiency in the next century is well within our means. Given the inefficiencies that now exist at every stage in the process--from mining and drilling for fuel through the use of energy in automobiles, appliances, and processes--the overall efficiency of the energy chain is only about 5%. From a social standpoint, accelerating productivity is not an option but rather an imperative for the future. It is necessary in order to provide the wealth for environmental sustainability, to support an aging population in the industrialized world, and to provide an economic ladder for developing nations. The second area of opportunity for technology lies in its potential to help stabilize global population at 10-12 billion sometime in the twenty-first century, possibly as early as 2075. The key is economics. Global communications, from television to movies to the Internet, have brought an image of the comfortable life of the developed world into the homes of the poorest people, firing their own aspirations for a better quality of life, either through economic development in their own country or through emigration to other countries. If we in the developed world can make the basic tools of prosperity--infrastructure, health care, education, and law--more accessible and affordable, recent history suggests that the cultural drivers for producing large families will be tempered, relatively quickly and without coercion. But the task is enormous. The physical prerequisites for prosperity in the global economy are electricity and communications. Today, there are more than 2 billion people living without electricity, or commercial energy in any form, in the very countries where some 5 billion people will be added in the next 50 years. If for no other reason than our enlightened self-interest, we should strive for universal access to electricity, communications, and educational opportunity. We have little choice, because the fate of the developed world is inextricably bound up in the economic and demographic fate of the developing world. A third, related opportunity for technology is in decoupling population growth from land use and, more broadly, decoupling economic growth from natural resource consumption through recycling, end-use efficiency, and industrial ecology. Decoupling population from land use is well under way. According to Grubler, from 1700 to 1850 nearly 2 hectares of land (5 acres) were needed to support every child born in North America, while in the more crowded and cultivated regions of Europe and Asia only 0.5 hectare (1.2 acres) and 0.2 hectare (0.5 acre) were needed, respectively. During the past century, the amount of land needed per additional child has been dropping in all areas of the world, with Europe and North America experiencing the fastest decreases. Both crossed the &quot;zero threshold&quot; in the past few decades, meaning that no additional land is needed to support additional children and that land requirements will continue to decrease in the future. One can postulate that the pattern of returning land to nature will continue to spread throughout the world, eventually stemming and then reversing the current onslaught on the great rain forests. Time is critical if vast tracts are to be saved from being laid bare, and success will largely depend on how rapidly economic opportunities expand for those now trapped in subsistence and frontier farming. In concept, the potential for returning land to nature is enormous. Futurist and scholar Jesse Ausubel of the Rockefeller University calculates that if farmers could lift average grain yields around the world just to the level of today's average U.S. corn grower, one-half of current global cropland--an area the size of the Amazon basin--could be spared. If agriculture is a leading indicator, then the continuous drive to produce more from less will prevail in other parts of the economy Certainly with shrinking agricultural land requirements, water distribution and use around the world can be greatly altered, since nearly two-thirds of water now goes for irrigation. Overall, the technologies of the future will, in the words of Ausubel, be &quot;cleaner, leaner, lighter, and drier&quot;--that is, more efficient and less wasteful of materials and water. They will be much more tightly integrated through microprocessor-based control and will therefore use human and natural resources much more efficiently and productively. Energy intensity, land intensity, and water intensity (and, to a lesser extent, materials intensity) for both manufacturing and agriculture are already heading downward. Only in agriculture are they falling fast enough to offset the surge in population, but, optimistically, advances in science and technology should accelerate the downward trends in other sectors, helping to decouple economic development from environmental impact in the coming century. One positive sign is the fact that recycling rates in North America are now approaching 65% for steel, lead, and copper and 30% for aluminum and paper. A second sign is that economic output is shifting away from resource-intensive products toward knowledge-based, immaterial goods and services. As a result, although the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) increased 200-fold (in real dollars) in the twentieth century, the physical weight of our annual output remains the same as it was in 1900. If anything, this trend will be accelerating. As Kevin Kelly, the editor of Wired magazine, noted, &quot;The creations most in demand from the United States [as exports] have lost 50% of their physical weight per dollar of value in only six years.... Within a generation, two at most, the number of people working in honest-to-goodness manufacturing jobs will be no more than the number of farmers on the land--less than a few percent. Far more than we realize, the network economy is pulling us all in.&quot; Even pollution shows clear signs of being decoupled from population and economic growth. Economist Paul Portney notes that, with the exception of greenhouse gases, &quot;in the OECD [Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development] countries, the favorable experience [with pollution control] has been a triumph of technology That is, the ratio of pollution per unit of GDP has fallen fast enough in the developed world to offset the increase in both GDP per capita and the growing number of 'capitas' themselves.&quot; The fourth opportunity for science and technology stems from their enormous potential to unlock resources not now available, to reduce human limitations, to create new options for policymakers and businesspeople alike, and to give us new levels of insight into future challenges. Technically resources have little value if we cannot unlock them for practical use. With technology, we are able to bring dormant resources to life. For example, it was only with the development of an electrolytic process late in the nineteenth century that aluminum--the most abundant metal on earth--became commercially available and useful. Chemistry unlocked hydrocarbons. And engineering allowed us to extract and put to diverse use untapped petroleum and gas fields. Over the course of history, technology has made the inaccessible accessible, and resource depletion has been more of a catalyst for change than a longstanding problem. Technology provides us with last-ditch methods (what economists would call substitutions) that allow us to circumvent or leapfrog over crises of our own making. Agricultural technology solved the food crisis of the first half of the nineteenth century. The English &quot;steam crisis&quot; of the 1860s, triggered by the rapid rise of coal-burning steam engines and locomotives, was averted by mechanized mining and the discovery and use of petroleum. The U.S. &quot;timber crisis&quot; that Teddy Roosevelt publicly worried about was circumvented by the use of chemicals that enabled a billion or so railroad ties to last for decades instead of years. The great &quot;manure crisis&quot; of the same era was solved by the automobile, which in a few decades replaced some 25 million horses and freed up 40 million hectares (100 million acres) of farmland, not to mention improving the sanitation and smell of inner cities. Oil discoveries in Texas and then in the Middle East pushed the pending oil crisis of the 1920s into the future. And the energy crisis of the 1970s stimulated the development of new sensing and drilling technology, sparked the advance of non--fossil fuel alternatives, and deepened the penetration of electricity with its fuel flexibility into the global economy. Thanks to underground imaging technology, today's known gas resources are an order of magnitude greater than the resources known 20 years ago, and new reserves continue to be discovered. Technology has also greatly extended human limits. It has given each of us a productive capability greater than that of 150 workers in 1800, for example, and has conveniently put the power of hundreds of horses in our garages. In recent decades, it has extended our voice and our reach, allowing us to easily send our words, ideas, images, and money around the world at the speed of light. But global sustainability is not inevitable. In spite of the tremendous promise that technology holds for a sustainable future, there is the potential for all of this to backfire before the job can be done. There are disturbing indications that people sometimes turn in fear and anger on technologies, industries, and institutions that openly foster an ever-faster pace of change. The current opposition to nuclear power genetically altered food, the globalization of the economy and the spread of American culture should give us pause. Technology has always presented a two-edged sword, serving as both cause and effect, solving one problem while creating another that was unintended and often unforeseen. We solved the manure crisis, but automotive smog, congestion, and urban sprawl took its place. We cleaned and transformed the cities with all-electric buildings rising thousands of feet into the sky. But while urban pollution was thereby dramatically reduced, a portion of the pollution was shifted to someone else's sky. &quot;Limits to growth&quot; was a popular theme in the 1970s, and a best-selling book of that name predicted dire consequences for the human race by the end of the century. In fact, we have done much better than those predictions, largely because of a factor the book missed--the potential of new technology to break limits. Repeatedly, human societies have approached seemingly insurmountable barriers only to find the means and tools to break through. This ability has now become a source of optimism, an article of faith, in many parts of the world. Today's perceived limits, however, look and feel different. They are global in nature, multicultural, and larger in scale and complexity than ever before. Nearly 2 billion people in the world are without adequate sanitation, and nearly as many are without access to clean drinking water. AIDS is spreading rapidly in the regions of the world least able to fight it. Atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases are more than 30% greater than preindustrial levels and are climbing steadily. Petroleum reserves, expected to be tapped by over a billion automobiles worldwide by 2015, may last only another 50-100 years. And without careful preservation efforts, the biodiversity of the planet could become as threatened in this coming century as it was at the end of the last ice age, when more than 70% of the species of large mammals and other vertebrates in North America disappeared (along with 29% in Europe and 86% in Australia). All these perceived limits require innovation of a scope and intensity surpassing humankind's current commitment. The list of real-world problems that could thwart global sustainability is long and sobering. It includes war, disease, famine, political and religious turmoil, despotism, entrenched poverty, illiteracy, resource depletion, and environmental degradation. Technology can help resolve some of these issues--poverty and disease, resource depletion, and environmental impact, for example--but it offers little recourse for the passions and politics that divide the world. The likelihood is that we will not catch up and overtake the moving target of global sustainability in the coming century, but given the prospects for technology, which have never been brighter, we may come surprisingly close. We should put our technology to work, striving to lift more than 5 billion people out of poverty while preventing irreversible damage to the biosphere and irreversible loss of the earth's natural resources. We cannot see the future of technology any more clearly than our forebears did--and for much the same reason. We are approaching the threshold of profound change, moving at great speed across a wide spectrum of technology, ranging today from the Internet to the Human Genome project. Technology in the twenty-first century will be turning toward biological and ecological analogs, toward microminiature machines, toward the construction of materials atom by atom, and toward the dispersion of microprocessor intelligence into everyday objects subsequently linked into neural networks. Computing power continues to double every 18 months, as postulated in Moore's law, promising to enable us to create much more powerful tools for everyday tasks, optimize business services and processes along new lines, understand complex natural phenomena like the weather and climate, and design technical systems that are self-diagnostic, self-healing, and self-learning. The networked, digital society of the future should be capable of exponential progress more in tune with biological models of growth than with the incremental progress of industrial societies. If history tells us anything, it is that in the long term we are much more likely to underestimate technology than to overestimate it. We are not unlike the excited crowds that in 1909 tried to imagine the future of flight as they watched Wilbur Wright loop his biplane twice around the Statue of Liberty and head back to Manhattan at the record-breaking speed of 30 miles per hour. As wild as one's imagination and enthusiasm might have been, it would have been inconceivable that exactly 60 years later humans would fly to the moon and back.<br />

If one does research or summarize the research of others – of course, most of the ideas, theories, and evidence discussed below have been produced by others – one cannot avoid some epistemological commitments. In the social sciences the fundamental choice is whether to pursue an ideographic or a nomothetic approach. Almost all historians choose the ideographic approach and focus on the description of structures or events, whereas most economists and psychologists choose the nomothetic approach and focus on the search for law-like general statements. Sociologists and political scientists are still divided – sometimes even by the Atlantic Ocean. In American political science the nomothetic approach dominates the flagship journal of the profession, the American Political Science Review, as well as more specialized journals, such as International Studies Quarterly, the Journal of Conflict Resolution, or World Politics. In German political science, however, the nomothetic approach has advanced little beyond electoral studies. My own approach is definitely nomothetic. This is related to my training in psychology at one of the first German universities focusing on quantitative research methods in the early 1960s, the University of Hamburg. This epistemological orientation has been reinforced by graduate training in international politics at one of the first American universities emphasizing quantitative research in the late 1960s, Northwestern University, which is located in a suburb of Chicago. Nomothetic research focuses on hypothesizing, testing and establishing law-like general statements or nomological propositions. Examples of such propositions are: The higher average incomes in a nation are, the more likely is democratic government. Or, the more economic freedom in a nation prevails, the less frequently it is involved in war. One characteristic of such propositions is that they say something about observable reality. Whenever you say something about reality, you risk that others find out that you are wrong. If we observed that most poor countries were democracies, but most rich countries were autocracies, then we should reject or, at least, modify the proposition about prosperity and democracy mentioned above.1 Nomothetic researchers look for refutations. They try to falsify their propositions or theories (Popper 1934/1959). If the empirical evidence is compatible with one's theory, then one keeps the hypothetical propositions and regards them as supported – until negative evidence turns up. Although certitude about possession of the truth is beyond the capabilities of human inquiry, growth of knowledge is conceivable by the successive elimination of errors. This epistemological approach borrowed from Popper were easily applicable, if most of our propositions were deterministic, if they claimed to be valid without exceptions. Then, finding a single exception to a general statement – say, about prosperity and democracy – would suffice to falsify the proposition. Looking at poor India nevertheless being democratic, or at fairly rich Kuwait nevertheless being autocratic, would suffice to reject the theory.2 Unfortunately, almost no theory in macroeconomics, macrosociology, or international relations delivers deterministic propositions. Instead we have only probabilistic statements of the type that more prosperous countries are more likely to be democratic than others, or that economically freer countries are more likely to avoid war involvement than others. Probabilistic assertions never can be falsified by pointing to single events which do not fit with theoretical expectations. Instead we have to look at relative frequencies, at correlations or regression coefficients. We need statistical tools to evaluate such propositions. We typically ask the question whether a hypothesized relationship is so strong that it could only rarely occur because of random measurement or sampling error. Probabilistic propositions are regarded as supported only if they jump certain thresholds of significance which are ultimately defined by mere conventions. Researchers are interested in causal propositions, that is, in statements about causes and effects, or determinants and consequences. Such statements can be used for explanation, forecasting, or policy interventions. We need to know more than the mere existence of some association or correlation between, say, prosperity and democracy, or economic freedom and the avoidance of military conflict. We need to know whether prosperity promotes democracy, or whether democracy promotes growth, or whether, possibly, both statements might be defensible or, for the time being, taken for 'true'. While a correlation between two variables, like prosperity and democracy, is equally compatible with the simple alternative causal propositions that prosperity causes democracy, and that democracy causes prosperity, this ambiguity no longer necessarily applies in more complex theoretical models. There, we tend to explain a single effect by a number of causes. For example, one may contend that democracy is promoted by prosperity as well as by a capitalist economic order (or economic freedom). We can take such a theoretical contention – which may be true or false, compatible with the data or not – as a starting point for specifying a regression equation.3 If both theoretical statements – about the democratizing effects of prosperity and capitalism – were true, then the regression coefficients of both variables should be positive and significant. If this is what we find in empirical research, then we regard the two propositions as provisionally supported. But final proofs remain impossible in empirical research. It is conceivable that some nonbeliever in the two propositions suggests a third measurable determinant of democracy. Before it actually is included in the regression equation, one never knows what its inclusion results in. Possibly, the previously significant and positive regression coefficients of prosperity and capitalism might be reduced to insignificance or even change signs. Then a previously supported causal proposition would have to be overturned and rejected. The claim of causality implies more than observable association or correlation. It also implies temporal precedence of causes before effects. If one wants to test the causal proposition that prosperity contributes to democratic government, or that economic freedom contributes to the avoidance of military conflict, then one should measure prosperity or economic freedom before their hypothesized effects occur – certainly not later. If there is doubt about the direction of causality, as there frequently is, one might also look at the relationships between, say, earlier prosperity and later democracy as well as between earlier democracy and later prosperity. Although such investigations may become technically complicated, it might suffice here to keep the general principles in mind. From causal propositions we derive expectations about correlation or regression coefficients. But conclusions from correlations to causal propositions are not justified. One simply can never 'verify' causal statements by correlations. From causal propositions we also derive expectations about temporal precedence. As long as empirical evidence fits one's theoretical expectations, one regards the propositions or theory as provisionally supported and works with them. There is another complication. As illustrated by the debate about the effects of trade and economic interdependence on the avoidance of military conflict below, full accordance of empirical studies and verdicts with theories is the exception rather than the rule – if it ever happens at all. That is why some philosophers of science (for example, Kuhn 1962; Lakatos 1968-69) have been critical of the idea of falsification and warned against premature rejection of propositions. If 'anomalies' or 'falsification' are more or less ubiquitous, then our task is no longer so easy as to choose between theories which have been falsified and therefore deserve rejection and those which are compatible with the facts and therefore deserve to be accepted until negative evidence turns up. Then our task becomes to choose between competing theories, for example about the conflict reinforcing or pacifying impact of trade, and to pick those which fit the data relatively better than others. So, the claim advanced in this review of the literature cannot be that the empirical evidence fits the capitalist peace idea perfectly, but merely that the evidence fits it much better than competing explanations of military conflict and notions about the negative impact of capitalism on the avoidance of conflict and war or the irrelevance of democracy do. The epistemological discussion above could provide no more than a crude 'feel' for empirical research in the social sciences and its pitfalls. Although certitude is beyond reach, it is better to rely on testable, tested and so far supported propositions than on a hodgepodge of ambiguous hunches, contradictory thinking, and unsystematically evaluated empirical evidence.<br />
Economic rationality must be prioritized first when evaluating solvency evidence – policies that ignore fundamental laws of economics are not properly utilizing epistemology and ontology<br />
Boetke ‘3 (Peter, professor of economics at George Mason ,Review of “Economics as Ideology”, published in Revue de Philosophie economique, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/pboettke/pubs/recenstion_douvrage.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/pboettke/pubs/recenstion_douvrage.pdf</a>)<br />
It is my belief that Hoover is led to this, and other positions in his book that I find objectionable, because he fails to see economics as a discipline which can provide us with knowledge equivalent in ontological stature to the law of gravity and that democratic deliberations often produce economic policies that are the equivalent of engineering proposals for human beings to float rather than walk or drive to their next destination. If my characterization is correct, then as we saw in the quote from Mises, the economists will find themselves in opposition to proposed policy solutions to right this or that perceived social wrong. The economist is put in the unenviable position of reminding fellow citizens that wishing it so doesn't necessarily make it so. The science of economics puts parameters on our utopias, and those who advocate utopian solutions cannot stand any suggestion that their plan for the future is unworkable. The discipline of economics in addition to providing a critique, also suggests that any alternative arrangement being proposed must specify the institutional mechanisms by which incentives between actors will become aligned and the correct information will flow to right actors in time for them to make appropriate decisions or learn from their previous decisions that mistakes were made so the appropriate adjustments will be made. If no mechanism is in place, then incentive incompatibilities and coordination failures will result so that no matter how beautiful the proposed policy might appear on paper the solution will be one of economic waste and political opportunism. Because Hoover's book doesn't deal with economic science in such a sustained way, it cannot at the end of the day explain the evolution of modern economic thought and without that there is no way to understand the creation of contemporary politics in the wake of the breakdown of the Keynesian consensus in the 1970s, the collapse of communism in the 1980s and the realization of the tragic failure of development planning in the third world in the 1990s. Economic reality, it turns out more than psycho-history is the best way to understand the way the world work. Bibliographie Easterly W., 2002 &lt;&lt;The Cartel of Good Intentions&gt;&gt;, Foreign Policy, July/August. 4. The distinction between ontology and epistemology are often forgotten in discussions of the methodology and philosophy of the social sciences. We come to know the laws of gravity in a manner different than we come to know the law of demand (question of epistemology), but the forces at work that are described by the law of gravity and the law of demand are nevertheless real in the same way (question of ontology). The argument for methodological dualism between the natural and social sciences that was made by Mises and then Hayek crucially relies on this distinction between ontology and epistemology. In other words, economics is capable of establishing laws that have the same ontological claim as those derived in physics, but they are arrived at through procedures of inquiry entirely different from those employed in the natural sciences.<br />
Economics is the only explanation of human behavior—it best explains cause-and-effect relationships and debating about economics erases state control of ignorant populace<br />
Rockwell 08<br />
(Rockwell Jr., president of the Ludwig von Mises Institute, 5/19/2008, Llewellyn, “Everything You Love You Owe to Capitalism,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://mises.org/story/2982" rel="nofollow">http://mises.org/story/2982</a>)<br />
Not even an event as spectacular as the spontaneous meltdown of a superpower and all its client states was enough to impart the message of economic freedom. And the truth is that it was not necessary. The whole of our world is covered with lessons about the merit of economic liberty over central planning. Our everyday lives are dominated by the glorious products of the market, which we all gladly take for granted. We can open up our web browsers and tour an electronic civilization that the market created, and note that government never did anything useful at all by comparison. We are also inundated daily by the failures of the state. We complain constantly that the educational system is broken, that the medical sector is oddly distorted, that the post office is unaccountable, that the police abuse their power, that the politicians have lied to us, that tax dollars are stolen, that whatever bureaucracy we have to deal with is inhumanly unresponsive. We note all this. But far fewer are somehow able to connect the dots and see the myriad ways in which daily life confirms that the market radicals like Mises, Hayek, Hazlitt, and Rothbard were correct in their judgments. What's more, this is not a new phenomenon that we can observe in our lifetimes only. We can look at any country in any period and note that every bit of wealth ever created in the history of mankind has been generated through some kind of market activity, and never by governments. Free people create; states destroy. It was true in the ancient world. It was true in the first millennium after Christ. It was true in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. And with the birth of complex structures of production and the increasing division of labor in those years, we see how the accumulation of capital led to what might be called a productive miracle. The world's population soared. We saw the creation of the middle class. We saw the poor improve their plight and change their own class identification. The empirical truth has never been hard to come by. What matters are the theoretical eyes that see. This is what dictates the lesson we draw from events. Marx and Bastiat were writing at the same time. The former said capitalism was creating a calamity and that abolition of ownership was the solution. Bastiat saw that statism was creating a calamity and that the abolition of state plunder was the solution. What was the difference between them? They saw the same facts, but they saw them in very different ways. They had a different perception of cause and effect. I suggest to you that there is an important lesson here as regards the methodology of the social sciences, as well as an agenda and strategy for the future. Concerning method, we need to recognize that Mises was precisely right concerning the relationship between facts and economic truth. If we have a solid theory in mind, the facts on the ground provide excellent illustrative material. They inform us about the application of theory in the world in which we live. They provided excellent anecdotes and revealing stories of how economic theory is confirmed in practice. But absent that theory of economics, facts alone are nothing but facts. They do not convey any information about cause and effect, and they do not point a way forward. Think of it this way. Let's say you have a bag of marbles that is turned upside down on the ground. Ask two people their impressions. The first one understands what numbers mean, what shapes mean, and what colors mean. This person can give a detailed account of what he sees: how many marbles, what kinds, how big they are, and this person can explain what he sees in different ways potentially for hours. But now consider the second person, who, we can suppose, has absolutely no understanding of numbers, not even that they exist as abstract ideas. This person has no comprehension of either shape or color. He sees the same scene as the other person but cannot provide anything like an explanation of any patterns. He has very little to say. All he sees is a series of random objects. Both these people see the same facts. But they understand them in very different ways, owing to the abstract notions of meaning that they carry in their minds. This is why positivism as pure science, a method of assembling a potentially infinite series of data points, is a fruitless undertaking. Data points on their own convey no theory, suggest no conclusions, and offer no truths. To arrive at truth requires the most important step that we as human beings can ever take: thinking. Through this thinking, and with good teaching and reading, we can put together a coherent theoretical apparatus that helps us understand. Now, we have a hard time conjuring up in our minds the likes of a man [person] who has no comprehension of numbers, colors, or shapes. And yet I suggest to you that this is precisely what we are facing when we encounter a person who has never thought about economic theory and never studied the implications of the science at all. The facts of the world look quite random to this person. He sees two societies next to each other, one free and prosperous and the other unfree and poor. He looks at this and concludes nothing important about economic systems because he has never thought hard about the relationship between economic systems and prosperity and freedom. He merely accepts the existence of wealth in one place and poverty in the other as a given, the same way the socialists at a lunch table assumed that the luxurious surroundings and food just happened to be there. Perhaps they will reach for an explanation of some sort, but absent economic education, it is not likely to be the correct one. Equally as dangerous as having no theory is having a bad theory that is assembled not by means of logic but by an incorrect view of cause and effect. This is the case with notions such as the Phillips Curve, which posits a tradeoff relationship between inflation and unemployment. The idea is that you can drive unemployment down very low if you are willing to tolerate high inflation; or it can work the other way around: you can stabilize prices provided you are willing to put up with high unemployment. Now, of course this makes no sense on the microeconomic level. When inflation is soaring, businesses don't suddenly say, hey, let's hire a bunch of new people! Nor do they say, you know, the prices we pay for inventory have not gone up or have fallen. Let's fire some workers! This much is true about macroeconomics: It is commonly treated like a subject completely devoid of any connection to microeconomics or even human decision making. It is as if we enter into a video game featuring fearsome creatures called Aggregates that battle it out to the death. So you have one creature called Unemployment, one called Inflation, one called Capital, one called Labor, and so on until you can construct a fun game that is sheer fantasy. Another example of this came to me just the other day. A recent study claimed that labor unions increase the productivity of firms. How did the researchers discern this? They found that unionized companies tend to be larger with more overall output than nonunionized companies. Well, let's think about this. Is it likely that if you close a labor pool to all competition, give that restrictive labor pool the right to use violence to enforce its cartel, permit that cartel to extract higher-than-market wages from the company and set its own terms concerning work rules and vacations and benefits — is it likely that this will be good for the company in the long run? You have to take leave of your senses to believe this. In fact, what we have here is a simple mix-up of cause and effect. Bigger companies tend to be more likely to attract a kind of unpreventable unionization than smaller ones. The unions target them, with federal aid. It is no more or less complicated than that. It is for the same reason that developed economies have larger welfare states. The parasites prefer bigger hosts; that's all. We would be making a big mistake to assume that the welfare state causes the developed economy. That would be as much a fallacy as to believe that wearing $2,000 suits causes people to become rich. I'm convinced that Mises was right: the most important step economists or economic institutions can take is in the direction of public education in economic logic. There is another important factor here. The state thrives on an economically ignorant public. This is the only way it can get away with blaming inflation or recession on consumers, or claiming that the government's fiscal problems are due to our paying too little in taxes. It is economic ignorance that permits the regulatory agencies to claim that they are protecting us as versus denying us choice. It is only by keeping us all in the dark that it can continue to start war after war — violating rights abroad and smashing liberties at home — in the name of spreading freedom. There is only one force that can put an end to the successes of the state, and that is an economically and morally informed public. Otherwise, the state can continue to spread its malicious and destructive policies.<br />
Finally, attempting to separate your criticism from economics is futile. Any alternative to a status quo ideology or system must eventually prove its method at some point using economic science, proving our methodology is at worst inevitable.<br />
Guala 02<br />
[Francesco Guala, “An Ontology of Economics?”, University of Exeter, 2002, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://people.exeter.ac.uk/fguala/OntologyLong.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://people.exeter.ac.uk/fguala/OntologyLong.pdf</a>]<br />
Presenting ontology as separate from social science however might have a tactical purpose: it might be aimed at isolating one’s speculations from criticism, especially the repeated request to come up with something better than the neoclassical approach in economics. Indeed Lawson goes at great length to explaining how such a request misunderstands the ultimate goal of ontological analysis. Unfortunately, in my view, this is a bit of an own goal. There’s a continuum, rather than a sharp divide, between ‘ontological’ (but we might as well just say ‘theoretical’) speculation and scientific research, and as I’ve tried to argue one can hardly proceed without the other. Despite dressing up as a metaphysician, the under-labourer of science must inevitably make use of (some) science – a lesson that Carnap and Quine taught us a long time ago. Moreover by artificially stressing the divide, one runs the risk of never convincing the (inevitably, scientifically minded) audience that one’s views are worth taking seriously. If there’s a continuum between abstract speculation and empirical research, the battle against dubious science (the neoclassical paradigm or whatever) must be fought across the whole front. And in fact there are philosophers and social scientists who fight it that way, by intelligently combining empirical investigation with philosophical analysis (the work of people like Bob Sugden 1998, Cristina Bicchieri 2000, Ian Hacking 2002, or Donald MacKenzie 2004, is what I have in mind here). These are friendly critiques. I’m raising these questions not to dismiss ontological research, but because I think they are important for the direction that economic ontology will take in the near future. A collection of quotations showing that some new institutional economists are against formalism while others are not (chapter 17), is not, in my view, an interesting contribution to ontology (although it might be an interesting contribution to something else). 5 Fortunately some chapters of the Companion brilliantly avoid the insulation from science. Faulkner and Runde (chapter 21) in their review of the concepts of information, knowledge, beliefs, intentions, provide a nice example of how to combine a general philosophical analysis with an overview of the relevant evidence provided by psychologists and behavioural economists. Similarly Geoffrey Ingham (chapter 23) illustrates how an ontology of money (which revealingly he calls a ‘theory of money’) cannot but be deeply informed by existing historical investigations in the origins and development of the many things that over the centuries have been considered ‘money’. John Davis (chapter 19) also argues convincingly that some philosophical disagreements concerning the intentional foundations of social institutions (‘I-intentionality’ vs. ‘we-intentionality’ foundations, in the current philosophical jargon) are not to be solved by means of conceptual analysis. There probably are examples of both kinds of institutions in reality, and which one is more common or robust is essentially an empirical matter. To sum up: ontology is probably here to stay, and this is a welcome development. It is important however that some key methodological issues are clarified before we proceed. Philosophers of economics must be allowed to tackle fundamental questions that are currently ignored by economists. And in fact it is not by chance that some important new areas of research have been first explored by philosophers. But we must also be aware that the purely speculative approach has some limitations, and can only go thus far unless it’s complemented by other methods. We must also be careful not to be fooled about the status of ontological analysis by trendy words (‘metaphysical’, ‘transcendental’, ‘essential’) which just hide philosophers’ unwillingness to get their hands dirty with the business of studying reality as it is – as opposed as how it should be according to their Oxbridge intuitions. Many social scientists outside economics have been busy studying rules, norms, institutions, beliefs, and the other entities that are at the core of ontological debate. In the end the boundaries between economic ontology, sociology, economic psychology, economic and social history, and so forth should turn out to be more arbitrary than we currently think.<br />
The only objective approach to knowledge accumulation is to engage in empirical falsification through the scientific method and historical decision-making.<br />
Fischer, 98 – Professor of Political Science at Rutgers University (Frank, “BEYOND EMPIRICISM: POLICY INQUIRY IN POSTPOSITIVIST PERSPECTIVE”, Published in Policy Studies Journal, Vol. 26. No.1 (Spring, 1998): 129-146)<br />
Neopositivism (or logical empiricism) has supplied the epistemological ideals of the contemporary social and policy sciences (Hawkesworth 1988; A theory of knowledge put forth to explain the concepts and methods of the physical and natural sciences, neopositivism has given shape as well to a social science in pursuit quantitatively replicable causal generalizations (Fay 1975). Most easily recognized as the stuff of the research methodology textbook, neopositivist principles emphasize empirical research designs, the use of sampling techniques and data gathering procedures, the measurement of outcomes, and the development of causal models with predictive power (Miller 1993; Bobrow and Dryzek 1987). In the field of policy analysis, such an orientation is manifested in quasi-experimental research designs, multiple regression analysis, survey research, input-output studies, cost-benefit analysis, operations research, mathematical simulation models, and systems analysis (Putt and Springer, 1989; Sylvia, et al. 1991). The only reliable approach to knowledge accumulation, according to this epistemology, is empirical falsification through objective hypothesis-testing of rigorously formulated causal generalizations (Popper, 1959: Sabatier and Jenkins-Smith 1992:231; Hofferbert 1990). The goal is to generate a body of empirical generalizations capable of explaining behavior across social and historical contexts, whether communities, societies, or cultures, independently of specific times, places, or circumstances. Not only are such propositions essential to social and political explanation, they are seen to make possible effective solutions to societal problems. Such propositions are said to supply the cornerstones of theoretical progress. Underlying this effort is a fundamental positivist principle mandating a rigorous separation of facts and values, the principle of the &quot;fact-value dichotomy&quot; (Bernstein 1976; Proctor 1991). According to this principle, empirical research is to proceed independently of normative context or implications. Because only empirically based causal knowledge can qualify social science as a genuine &quot;scientific&quot; endeavor, social scientists are instructed to assume a &quot;value-neutral&quot; orientation and to limit their research investigations to empirical or &quot;factual&quot; phenomena. Even though adherence to this &quot;fact-value dichotomy&quot; varies in the conduct of actual research, especially at the methodological level, the separation still reigns in the social sciences. To be judged as methodologically valid, research must at least officially pay its respects to the principle (Fischer 1980). In the policy sciences the attempt to separate facts and values has facilitated a technocratic form of policy analysis that emphasizes the efficiency and effectiveness of means to achieve politically established goals. Much of policy analysis, in this respect, has sought to translate inherently normative political and social issues into technically defined ends to be pursued through administrative means. In an effort to sidestep goal-value conflicts typically associated with policy issues, economic and social problems are interpreted as issues in need of improved management and program design; their solutions are to be found in the technical applications of the policy sciences (Amy 1987). Often associated with this orientation has been a belief in the superiority of scientific decision-making. Reflecting a subtle antipathy toward democratic processes, terms such as &quot;pressures&quot; and &quot;expedient adjustments&quot; are used to denigrate pluralistic policymaking. If politics doesn't fit into the methodological scheme, then politics is the problem. Some have even argued that the political system itself must be changed to better accommodate policy analysis (Heineman et al. 1990). In the face of limited empirical successes, neopositivists have had to give some ground. Although they continue to stress rigorous empirical research as the long-run solution to their failures, they have retreated from their more ambitious efforts. Today their goal is to aim for propositions that are at least theoretically proveable at some future point in time. An argument propped up by the promise of computer advances, it serves to keep the original epistemology in tack. But the modification misses the point, as postpositivists are quick to point out. The problem is more fundamentally rooted in the empirical social scientists's misunderstanding of the nature of the social. As we shall see, it is a misunderstanding lodged in the very concept of a generalizable, value-free objectivity that neopositivists seek to reaffirm and more intensively apply.<br />

How might the challenges of reducing greenhouse gases benefit from a historical analysis of technological advance, the diffusion of innovations, and their integration into the economy? What could be learned from a deeper look at the way the U.S. government has in the past marshaled national resources and capabilities—its own and those of the private sector, from which most innovations flow— to stimulate a system able to provide lasting conditions for progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption? In order to test that historical analysis against the specific needs of particular technologies now available or on the horizon, we engaged the participation of a wide range of experts on innovation, as well as technical experts, in “case studies” of three sample technologies: photovoltaics, post-combustion capture of carbon dioxide from power plants, and direct removal of CO2 from Earth’s atmosphere. In three workshops we asked: What would these technologies need in order to contribute substantially to the decarbonization of the energy system and greenhouse gas reduction? The results of this study offer a fundamentally new perspective on orienting government and the private sector toward near-term gains in the development of technologies to serve the public good of a decarbonized energy system.
