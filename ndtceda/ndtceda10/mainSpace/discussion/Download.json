As an organizer, you can generate the export and add upload it to your space as a file if you'd like other people to have access to it.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nDom&quot;<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\nSo it looks like after the recent changes only the individuals with the Organizer status have the ability to download the Wiki, unlike what it was before when everyone could download it."}]}
