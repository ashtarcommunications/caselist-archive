A2: Capitalism<br />
<br />
The criticism attempts to script the process of resistance and in doing so only reifies managerial control intrinsic to modernity and entrenches elite control<br />

<br />
Many critics in both the modern and ….things do not always live up to revolutionary expectations.<br />
<br />
<br />
Their qritiq’s attempt to characterize power in a particular way (through capital, through knowledge, through psyche, through chaos, through gender…) assumes that power is a 'substance' that CAN be characterized. This is FALSE, power is produced by actants [real shit] that exist in relation to one another BEFORE those relations have been defined through power. Their attempt to arbitrarily fit a system to a concept, as proven by centuries of pointless philosophical bickering, inevitably fails<br />

Borders makes sovereign violence against visa-bearers inevitable – creates zones of exception<br />

Derrida describes how becoming ….crossing the frontier as an exceptional act.<br />
<br />
Only the plan solves – we do not claim to know what sort of imperfect art will result from the cultural mixing enabled by the plan BUT this is precisely the point – only an engagement with alterity which refuses to presuppose an outcome can produce truly radical resistance<br />
<br />
We must be ready for the aesthetic of our resistance to change, we must be ready to overflow our bare intentionality, to resist our conceptual technologies of control to become a wrench in the machine of aesthetic figuration that changes the nature of the game<br />

What de Certeau describes is the use of ….the strategic is to alter the dominant itself.<br />
<br />
Commodification is precisely what makes art a zone of contestation where reflexive criticism can de-stabilize dominant modes of consumption and reified existence<br />

Their alt is narcissistic—politics must look beyond simply saying “no” to the creation of a new, more humane, social order<br />

No form of discursive irony is ….resistance to authorized truth<br />

Their alternative short-circuits all positive change to maintain the status quo<br />

There is no all-encompassing capitalist system – their totalizing qritiq makes coherent analysis of economic power impossible<br />

2AC Ontological Challenge<br />
<br />
Reject the negative’s attempt to render an ethical judgment on a system – this move both assumes a universalized set of ethical rules and a homogenous economic system that can be adequately characterized by universal norms<br />
