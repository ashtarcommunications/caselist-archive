<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The anticipated military buildup obviously continues to be the main engine driving current Guam economic activity. The official time frame continues to concentrate on the 2010-2014 period. </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Skepticism remains about</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> both ends of that </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">time frame,</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> however — whether it will actually begin in 2010, and if so </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">whether it can be completed by 2014.</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Some of </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">this skepticism prevails</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">even </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">among higher ranking military personnel</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> involved. (Admiral Timothy Keating, Commander of the U.S. Pacific Command in Hawaii, was quoted recently by Reuters as saying: “We are behind a timeline to achieve that goal of 8,000 (Marines) down to Guam, and we don’t have enough money to make it happen right now, . . . I don’t think it will happen on time. I think it will be more expensive. . .A case can be made that a more measured, longer term approach. . . could be beneficial.” He partially retracted these words later.) Some slippage in timing, and spreading out of the buildup activity over a longer period, could actually be better for the Guam economy. There will be plenty of growth even if it is spread out, and doing so may avoid some bottlenecks and inflationary pressures. Less workforce housing would also be required, if somewhat fewer workers are on-island at the same time. (Contractors will be expected to provide housing for the workers they require, but discussions are underway to make this housing amenable for other uses on Guam once the buildup is complete.) One recent development of significance occurred in February when Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, on the first stop of her first overseas trip, signed the Guam International Agreement with Japanese Foreign Minister Hirofumi Nakasone in Tokyo. The agreement gave greater certainty to the relocation of the 8,000 Marines from Okinawa to Guam. For the present Japanese administration, the agreement was held as proof positive of a close-knit defense relationship between the two nations. In Clinton’s words, it “reflects the commitment we have to modernizing our military posture in the Pacific.” Under terms of the agreement, Japan is to provide $6.1 billion of the now estimated $10.3 billion total cost of the move, including housing construction and other infrastructure. The transfer does depend, however, on Japan making “tangible progress” on moving the operations of the Marine Corps’ Futenma Air Station to a new facility to be built at the existing Camp Schwab on the northeast coast of Okinawa. And there are environmental concerns involved there. Two runways are to be built on an area that is home to rare flora and fauna, including coral reefs and protected dugong sea cows. It should be noted that </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the transfer plan remains controversial in Japan, and funding it may be an obstacle to the project being implemented </span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">by the 2014 deadline. The opposition party will likely take a hard look at any agreements if they gain power, which could happen in a general election that must be called by October. Another stepping stone in the process is the required Environmental Impact Study for Guam. A draft inviting public comments is expected to be set forth in June 2009 with a final Record of Decision targeted for January 2010. The phrase “military buildup” is often associated only with the Marine relocation. That alone is big enough. Consider the implications of adding 8,000 military personnel and 9,000 dependents — 17,000 in all — to an island where the existing population is only about 170,000. </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Adding 10% to any population has huge economic and infrastructure consequences.</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> “Funding for military moves to Guam is controversial in Japan.” But the Marine transfer is not the only aspect involved for Guam. The Navy and the Air Force are also part of it, and much of that is already underway. </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The Navy</span></u> <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">is</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in the process of </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">improving</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> its </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">harbor facilities to accommodate newer and larger submarines and supply ships</span></u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-size: 8pt;">, </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">as well as visiting</span> <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">aircraft carriers.</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Matson and Horizon Lines chipped in to purchase three refurbished Hitachi gantry cranes for the harbor. Matson and Horizon will also provide operators for testing and training. These cranes will enable the port to handle more cargo and through-put of containers, more easily meeting customer demands, maintaining inventory levels, and keeping vessels on time. All this is necessary because of the vastly increased volume of material that the port must handle in the buildup. The Air Force has already established a very large fuel storage capacity at Andersen Air Force Base, and is constructing facilities to house and support its most sophisticated aircraft. Four B2 bombers are there all year now, for example. </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">A new runway is</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> also under construction at Andersen, the second </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">to be completed </span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">there. These </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">runways are critically important for all forces on Guam</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Another addition to the Andersen arsenal is the expected early 2010 arrival of the RQ-4A Global Hawk. This is a state-of-the-art high altitude, long endurance, unmanned aerial reconnaissance aircraft that can cover large geographic areas. This aircraft has civilian as well as military applications — such as reconnaissance of hurricanes, earthquakes, and other natural disasters. So the Guam military buildup has actually begun before the announced 2010 starting date. The Navy has been designated to play the central role in managing all this under the military’s new joint basing arrangement, which is expected to contribute to greater economic efficiency. An Army contingent to defend all of this has also been planned. But that will not occur until near the far end of the buildup. One fact frequently forgotten is how much more costly such a buildup is in an isolated island location like Guam. (One military estimate is that something that would cost $1 to build on the U.S. Mainland on average costs $2.64 on Guam.) But military sources emphasize that </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">50-year decisions are now being made on Guam, to underpin 50 years of growth</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">challenges and hurdles to impending growth</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> discussed in detail in last year’s report loom as large as ever. These </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">include</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> not just port facilities but other infrastructure challenges in the areas of power, water and waste water, solid waste disposal, </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">labor shortages </span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(where workers will come from and where they will be housed), transportation, telecommunications, health and social services, and environmental challenges. </span><br />

Tucked away in Title VII of that act, which was signed into law on May 8, 2008, is a provision that will exempt the U.S. territory of Guam and the U.S. Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) from caps on all H visas through the end of 2014. </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">This provision should open the door for </span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">military contractors to pull both skilled and unskilled</span> <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">labor from the Philippines and other nations to </span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">help</span> <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">implement</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">what has been called </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the largest U.S. military project</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of its kind </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">since </span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">the end of</span> <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the Cold War</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. It should also open up unique opportunities for companies that are not participating in the buildup. Last year, when I was still heading the federal office that administers the U.S. relationship with Guam and the other territories and co-chairing the federal Interagency Task Force on the Guam Military Buildup, my staff and I drafted the original version of the act's immigration provisions. The military buildup will completely transform Guam, a U.S. territory in the Western Pacific with a current population of approximately 170,000. That population is projected to jump to 225,000 in a few short years, thanks to the relocation of 8,000 U.S. Marines and 9,000 of their dependents from Okinawa, the arrival of thousands of workers, and a sharp increase in the level of economic activity on the island. </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The centerpiece of the military buildup will be the</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">US$10.3 billion </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">relocation of</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Marines from Okinawa, which will require the construction of a new military base, </span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">military housing and utilities. </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">This massive project is scheduled to occur during a very compressed time frame from 2010 through 2014.</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">An additional US$4 billion or more is expected to be spent on Navy, Air Force and Army facilities on Guam. In addition to the billions of dollars of military expenditures planned for Guam, a great deal of capital will likely be attracted to the civilian economy. In order to cope with a large, rapid spike in its population, Guam's civilian infrastructure will have to be significantly upgraded and expanded. This should create opportunities for companies involved in the development, construction and operation of critical infrastructure such as ports, power, water, wastewater and solid waste. The 55,000 additional people who are expected to arrive on Guam's shores in a few years, mostly civilians, will all need, in addition to utilities, places to live, places to shop, places to dine, products to buy, services to consume, etc. This is likely to have a significant impact on Guam's economy. What the act will do The act will exempt both Guam and its neighbor, the CNMI, from national caps on all H visas at least through Dec. 31, 2014. Most of the </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">construction workers required for the buildup are expected to be brought in on H-2B visas</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> for temporary nonagricultural workers. </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Importing large numbers of workers will be necessary because of </span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">the very</span> <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">limited </span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">number of </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">qualified workers on Guam, and </span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">because of the</span> <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">practical difficulties of attracting </span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">large numbers of</span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"> U.S. workers cost-effectively</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> to a territory that is over 6,000 miles away from the closest point on the U.S. mainland. Guam, which bills itself as “America in Asia,” is approximately three hours from Manila by plane, and is expected to draw most of the workers needed for the buildup from the Philippines because of its large, well trained, English-speaking work force. </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> nationwide </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">annual cap on H-2B visas is</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> currently set at </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">66,000, and demand</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">for these visas </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">far outstrips supply</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Without the cap exemption, it would be impossible for</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> a small territory such as </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Guam to utilize such a large share of the entire nation's allocation of temporary nonagricultural workers</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. It should be noted that H-2B visas should be issued for jobs that are temporary and for which the need is either a one-time, seasonal, peak or intermittent one. It may require further analysis to determine whether most of the construction jobs that will be generated by the buildup will fit comfortably within these requirements. While the cap exemption for H-2B visas has been the principal focus of Department of Defense planners, the exemption will also apply to H-1B visas for professional or specialty workers. That will enable engineers, architects, computer professionals, health care professionals, professors and teachers, scientists, accountants, financial analysts and many other types of professionals to enter Guam or the CNMI without regard to the current nationwide cap of 65,000 for H-1B visas, which is supplemented with an additional 20,000 visas for applicants with a U.S. master's degree or higher. Unique business opportunities By allowing both skilled and unskilled workers to enter the CNMI as well as Guam without regard to the stringent limits applicable to the rest of the country, the act should create opportunities that go well beyond the military buildup. For one thing, the act could help ensure a sufficient supply of labor for all of the civilian infrastructure improvements and commercial development expected for Guam. Also, companies frustrated by their inability to secure needed skilled or unskilled employees might consider establishing operations in the CNMI or Guam as an alternative to assuming the risks associated with operating outside of the U.S. As one example, software companies might bring foreign software engineers to work in the CNMI as a way to get them “in the door” while they await the adjudication of their visa applications for work on the mainland. While the H cap exemption is very likely to result in an influx of workers from the Philippines, it will also likely attract talent from other countries. Japan, for example, will provide about 60 percent of the funding for the relocation of the Marines to Guam, and Japanese companies are expected to get a significant amount of business from this project. The exemption will enable these Japanese companies to bring in more of their own professionals and other workers than would otherwise have been possible. The exemption will also enable professionals and other employees from Korea, Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand and many other countries to participate in the buildup and other activities in Guam and the CNMI. It should be noted that workers should be admitted on H visas only to the extent that qualified U.S. workers are not available; the exemption from caps on H visas will not exempt employers from demonstrating that qualified U.S. workers are not available.

Under the act, the exemption is scheduled to apply to H visa applications submitted during a period of approximately six and a half years, and perhaps less. The exemption is scheduled to go into effect on June 1, 2009, although the effective date can be delayed by up to 180 days at the discretion of the Secretary of Homeland Security. The effective date could therefore be postponed to as late as November 2009. </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The exemption is</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> initially </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">scheduled to expire </span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">on Dec. 31, </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">2014</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. However, the statute indicates that the exemption would be in effect during a transition program designed to incorporate the CNMI's existing guest-worker program into the federal system. That transition program is originally scheduled to terminate on Dec. 31, 2014, but could be extended indefinitely as necessary by the Secretary of Labor in increments of up to five years.<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.dwt.com/LearningCenter/Advisories?find=27254#_ftn1" rel="nofollow">1</a> Whether the exemption is in effect for six and half years or longer, it is likely to have a very significant impact on Guam and the CNMI and on non-U.S. companies searching for opportunities there. Possible amendments to act Although the act was just signed into law, some are already predicting that it will be amended. As noted previously, it is possible that the requirements for H-2B visas, at least as they apply to Guam, will have to be tweaked in order to accommodate the types of jobs that will be needed for the military buildup.

It is therefore quite possible that the statute will be amended to enable the H cap exemption, at least as it applies to Guam, to be extended based on a continuing need for labor for the buildup in Guam. It is also possible that mainland companies that will have established operations in Guam and the CNMI will push to make the H cap exemption permanent if the program proves to be successful and does not impact labor in the 50 states. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">TOKYO — When it comes to regional security, many Western Pacific nations like the idea of thousands of U.S. Marines permanently stationed close by. As long as they are not too close. As part of a complex plan to reduce the sprawling American military presence on the Japanese island of Okinawa, U.S. officials approached Thailand, Singapore, the Philippines and Australia about the possibility of hosting permanent new American military bases. All four said no. That left tiny Guam, which for more than six decades has served as a reliable American staging point during wars and an often-forgotten port and air strip during peacetime. </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Military leaders say </span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">that</span> <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">maintaining a stable home for U.S. troops in Asia is vital for security in a region where Islamic extremists are fighting in the Philippines and Indonesia, North Korea remains erratic and threatening, and China is seeking to expand its economic and military influence</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">1. The planned relocation of approximately eight thousand U.S. Marines from Okinawa to Guam has great significance for the security of Japan. Therefore, it is not enough for the Japanese to discuss this issue merely as a matter of reducing the burden on local communities in Okinawa and determining the cost of the relocation that Japan will assume. Instead, Japan needs to explore thoroughly the relocation of the U.S. bases in relation to its future security (for more details, see section I of the full report). 2. The relocation of the U.S. Marine Corps forces from Okinawa to Guam is part of both the buildup of U.S. bases in Guam and the realignment of U.S. forces in Japan (see section II). 3. Because Japan will assume the considerable financial cost of the relocation, it should use this as an opportunity to enhance its own security. Moreover, Japan's support for the relocation will have an important role in America's overall plan to strengthen its bases in Guam. Accordingly, Japan should be actively involved in implementing the relocation with regard to its own interests. Whenever necessary, Japan should work with the United States to benefit from the military development of Guam in proportion to its financial support, considering the use of Guam's base facilities for its Self-Defense Forces (SDF) (see section II). 4.

The United States also will maintain its capability to support Japan in the event of a military conflict between Japan and China over the Senkaku Islands or in the East China Sea, since U.S. Marine units on high combat readiness will remain in Okinawa.

According to General Matthew Ridgeway, commander of the US Eighth Army which fought against the Chinese in the Korean War, the US had at the time thought of using nuclear weapons against China to save the US from military defeat. In his book The Korean War, a personal account of the military and political aspects of the conflict and its implications on future US foreign policy, Gen Ridgeway said that US was confronted with two choices in Korea -- truce or a broadened war, which could have led to the use of nuclear weapons. If the US had to resort to nuclear weaponry to defeat China long before the latter acquired a similar capability, there is little hope of winning a war against China 50 years later, short of using nuclear weapons. The US estimates that China possesses about 20 nuclear warheads that can destroy major American cities. </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Beijing</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> also </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">seems prepared</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">to go</span> <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">for the nuclear option</span>.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> A Chinese military officer disclosed recently that Beijing was considering a review of its “non first use” principle regarding nuclear weapons. Major-General Pan Zhangqiang, president of the military-funded Institute for Strategic Studies, told a gathering at the Woodrow Wilson International Centre for Scholars in Washington that although the government still abided by that principle, there were strong pressures from the military to drop it. He said military leaders considered the use of nuclear weapons mandatory if the country risked dismemberment as a result of foreign intervention. Gen Ridgeway said that should that come to pass, we would see the destruction of civilisation. There would be no victors in such a war. While the prospect of a </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">nuclear Armaggedon</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">over Taiwan might seem inconceivable, it</span> <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">cannot be ruled out</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">entirely, for China puts sovereignty above everything else. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The international community is increasingly aware that cooperative diplomacy is the most productive way to tackle the multiple, interconnected global challenges facing humanity, not least of which is the increasing proliferation of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction. Korea and Northeast Asia are instances where risks of nuclear proliferation and actual nuclear use arguably have increased in recent years. This negative trend is a product of continued US nuclear threat projection against the DPRK as part of a general program of coercive diplomacy in this region, North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme, the breakdown in the Chinese-hosted Six Party Talks towards the end of the Bush Administration, regional concerns over China’s increasing military power, and concerns within some quarters in regional states (Japan, South Korea, Taiwan) about whether US extended deterrence (“nuclear umbrella”) afforded under bilateral security treaties can be relied upon for protection. </span><u>The <span style="background: yellow;">consequences of failing to address the</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">proliferation</span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"> threat posed by </span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">the</span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"> North Korea </span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">developments, and related political and economic issues, </span><u>are<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"> serious</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, not only for the Northeast Asian region but for the whole international community. At worst, </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">there is the </span>possibility of nuclear attack</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> 1, whether</span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"> by </span>intention, miscalculation, <span style="background: yellow;">or</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">merely</span> <u><span style="background: yellow;">accident</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, leading to the resumption of Korean War hostilities. On the Korean Peninsula itself, key population centres are well within short or medium range missiles. The whole of Japan is likely to come within North Korean missile range. Pyongyang has a population of over 2 million, Seoul (close to the North Korean border) 11 million, and Tokyo over 20 million. </span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-size: 8pt;">Even </span><u><span style="background: yellow;">a limited nuclear exchange would result in a holocaust of unprecedented proportions.</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> But the catastrophe within the region would not be the only outcome. New research indicates that even a limited nuclear war in the region would rearrange our global climate far more quickly than global warming. Westberg draws attention to new studies modelling the effects of even a limited nuclear exchange involving approximately 100 Hiroshima-sized 15 kt bombs2 (by comparison it should be noted that the United States currently deploys warheads in the range 100 to 477 kt, that is, individual warheads equivalent in yield to a range of 6 to 32 Hiroshimas).The studies indicate that the soot from the fires produced would lead to a decrease in global temperature by 1.25 degrees Celsius for a period of 6-8 years.3 In Westberg’s view: That is not global winter, but the nuclear darkness will cause a deeper drop in temperature than at any time during the last 1000 years. The temperature over the continents would decrease substantially more than the global average. A decrease in rainfall over the continents would also follow…The period of nuclear darkness will cause much greater decrease in grain production than 5% and it will continue for many years...hundreds of millions of people will die from hunger…To make matters even worse, such amounts of smoke injected into the stratosphere would cause a huge reduction in the Earth’s protective ozone.4 These, of course, are not the only consequences. Reactors might also be targeted, causing further mayhem and downwind radiation effects, superimposed on a smoking, radiating ruin left by nuclear next-use. Millions of refugees would flee the affected regions. The direct impacts, and the follow-on impacts on the global economy via ecological and food insecurity, could make the present global financial crisis pale by comparison. How the great powers, especially the nuclear weapons states respond to such a crisis, and in particular, whether nuclear weapons are used in response to nuclear first-use, could make or break the global non proliferation and disarmament regimes. There could be many unanticipated impacts on regional and global security relationships5, with </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">subsequent nuclear breakout and geopolitical turbulence</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, including possible loss-of-control over fissile material or warheads in the chaos of nuclear war, and aftermath chain-reaction affects involving other potential proliferant states. The Korean nuclear proliferation issue is </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">not just a regional threat but a global one that warrants priority consideration</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> from the international community. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Not long before U.S. President Barack Obama held his low-key meeting in the White House with the exiled Tibetan leader last month, the Dalai Lama, a Chinese Embassy spokesman in Washington issued a statement on the talks and the U.S. decision to provide a new package of defensive arms to Taiwan. &quot;China's positions on issues like arms sales to Taiwan, and Tibet, have been consistent and clear,&quot; Wang Baodong said, &quot;as these issues bear on</span> <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">sovereignty and territorial integrity</span>,</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">which</span> <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">are</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">close to</span> <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Chinese core national interest</span></u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">s</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.&quot; He was echoing top</span> <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Chinese leaders</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">who refer to keeping Tibet, Xinjiang, Macau and Hong Kong as part of China, and the recovery of Taiwan, as &quot;core&quot; sovereignty interests. What Beijing means by this and similar phases asserting national integrity is that such interests are vital, cannot be compromised, and will be protected at all costs — by force if necessary. As China strengthens economically and militarily and its cooperation is increasingly needed to solve pressing international problems, even leading powers like the United States must defer, to some extent, to China's core interests if it wants collaboration on other matters. A big question for some of China's neighbors, including Japan, India and Southeast Asia, is if and when Beijing will extend its list of core sovereignty interests to include claims to land territory that India says belongs to it, and to sea and island territory that Japan and some Southeast Asian countries say belongs to them. This is a major issue and </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the scale of the claims</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">can be</span> <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">exacerbated by emotive nationalism</span>. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">China's claims are linked to the</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">maintenance or</span> <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">recovery of territory it says was taken by colonial powers when it was weak</span>. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Beijing insists that</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">around 90,000 square kilometers of territory in</span> <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">India's mountainous northeast</span>,</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">covering virtually the whole of the state of Arunachal Pradesh, </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">is part of China</span>.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Meanwhile, India rejects Chinese rule over 38,000 square km of Kashmir land ceded by Pakistan to China in 1964.

He added that China's military modernization has &quot;a clear purpose, that is to maintain national security and unity, and ensure smooth economic and social development.&quot; The key point here is the definition of China's national unity. So far, this has not included territory disputed with India, Japan and Southeast Asia.

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Although the prospects are remote that China will mount conventional military attacks against the sea-lanes for the foreseeable future, the possibility cannot be ruled out that</span> <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">hostilities could break out between China and one of the ASEAN states</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">in the South China Sea, perhaps as a result of an incident that spins out of control. In this scenario, China might seek to deter U.S. military involvement by raising the costs of conflict enough to weaken U.S. resolve. The Chinese could calculate, whether correctly or not, that the United States might hesitate to place its carriers at risk, and that China’s growing cruise and ballistic missile capabilities would provide Beijing with a credible “sea denial” option.8 Indeed, </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">territorial disputes in the South China Sea</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> have emerged as the key external security issue facing ASEAN and </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">pose the greatest potential “flashpoint” for conflict in Southeast Asia</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (see Figure 3.1). Beijing’s quest for improved power projection capabilities, assertiveness in pressing its maritime and territorial claims in the South China Sea, and track record in using force to defend China’s sovereignty have all stirred apprehensions in Southeast Asia about China’s intentions. Much of the worry reflects an underlying, if often unspoken, fear that Chinese assertiveness foreshadows a China that will become more menacing as its power grows. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Since September 2001, the United States has increased focus on radical Islamist and terrorist groups in Southeast Asia, particularly those in the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Singapore. </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Southeast Asia has been a base for terrorist operations</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Al Qaeda penetrated the region</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> by </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">establishing local cells, training Southeast Asians</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in its camps in Afghanistan, </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">and</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> by </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">financing and cooperating with indigenous radical Islamist groups</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Indonesia and the</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> southern </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Philippines have been particularly vulnerable</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> to penetration by Islamic terrorist groups. Members of one indigenous network, Jemaah Islamiyah (JI), which has had extensive ties to Al Qaeda, helped two of the September 11, 2001 hijackers and have confessed to </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">plotting and carrying out attacks against Western targets</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. These include </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the deadliest terrorist attack since</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> September </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">2001</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">: the October 2002 bombing in Bali, Indonesia, that killed approximately 200 people, mostly Westerners. Since the Bali bombing in 2002, crackdowns by various governments in the region—encouraged and in some cases supported by the U.S. government and military— are believed to have weakened JI to such an extent that it essentially is no longer a regional organization, but rather is one confined to Indonesia, with some individuals still operating in the southern Philippines. The degrading of JI’s leadership structure is believed to have altered the group’s strategy. </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">More violent, anti-Western</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> JI </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">members have formed breakaway cells</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In September 2009, Indonesian authorities claimed they had killed the leader of one such cell, Noordin Mohammed Top. Noordin is believed to have been responsible for organizing the nearsimultaneous July 17, 2009 bombings of the J.W. Marriot and Ritz-Carlton hotels in Jakarta. The bombings were the first successful anti-Western terrorist attack in Indonesia in four years. Their sophistication triggered speculation that Al Qaeda had renewed ties with Top. To combat the threat, the U.S. has pressed countries in the region to arrest suspected terrorist individuals and organizations, funded and trained Indonesia’s elite counter-terrorist unit, and deployed troops to the southern Philippines to advise the Philippine military in their fight against the violent Abu Sayyaf Group. It has also launched a Regional Maritime Security Initiative to enhance security in the Straits of Malacca, increased intelligence sharing operations, restarted military-military relations with Indonesia, and provided or requested from Congress substantial aid for Indonesia and the Philippines. Also, since 2001, Thailand and the United States have substantially increased their anti-terrorism cooperation. The responses of countries in the region to both the threat and to the U.S. reaction generally have varied with the intensity of their concerns about the threat to their own stability and domestic politics. In general, Singapore, Malaysia, and the Philippines were quick to crack down on militant groups and share intelligence with the United States and Australia, whereas Indonesia began to do so only after attacks or arrests revealed the severity of the threat to its citizens. Since that time, Indonesian authorities have been aggressive in their pursuit of terrorists and extremist groups. Many governments view increased American pressure and military presence in their region with ambivalence because of the political sensitivity of the issue with both mainstream Islamic and secular nationalist groups. The </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Muslim insurgency in</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> southern </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Thailand has escalated in recent years as has terrorist activity in</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">southern areas of </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the Philippines</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The report looks at the rise of Islamist militancy and the JI network, and discusses terrorism in the region, concluding with options for U.S. policy. Strategies include placing greater emphasis on attacking institutions that support terrorism, building up regional governments’ capacities for combating terrorist groups, and reducing the sense of alienation among Muslim citizens. </span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Last week’s brutal suicide bombings in Baghdad and Jerusalem have once again illustrated dramatically that the international community failed, thus far at least, to understand the magnitude and </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">implications of</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">terrorist threats to the very survival of civilization itself</span>.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Even the United States and Israel have for decades tended to regard terrorism as a mere tactical nuisance or irritant rather than a critical strategic challenge to their national security concerns. It is not surprising, therefore, that on September 11, 2001, Americans were stunned by the unprecedented tragedy of 19 al Qaeda terrorists striking a devastating blow at the center of the nation’s commercial and military powers. Likewise, Israel and its citizens, despite the collapse of the Oslo Agreements of 1993 and numerous acts of terrorism triggered by the second intifada that began almost three years ago, are still “shocked” by each suicide attack at a time of intensive diplomatic efforts to revive the moribund peace process through the now revoked cease-fire arrangements [hudna]. Why are the United States and Israel, as well as scores of other countries affected by the universal nightmare of modern terrorism surprised by new terrorist “surprises”? There are many reasons, including misunderstanding of the manifold specific factors that contribute to terrorism’s expansion, such as lack of a universal definition of terrorism, the religionization of politics, double standards of morality, weak punishment of terrorists, and the exploitation of the media by terrorist propaganda and psychological warfare. Unlike their historical counterparts, </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">contemporary terrorists </span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">have</span> <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">introduced a new scale of violence</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">in terms of conventional and unconventional threats and impact.</span> <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The internationalization and brutalization of </span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">current and future</span> <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">terrorism make </span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">it clear we have entered </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">an Age of Super Terrorism</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> [e.g. </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">biological, chemical</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, radiological, </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">nuclear and cyber</span>]</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> with its serious implications concerning national, regional and global security concerns. Two myths in particular must be debunked immediately if an effective counterterrorism “best practices” strategy can be developed [e.g., strengthening international cooperation]. The first illusion is that terrorism can be greatly reduced, if not eliminated completely, provided the root causes of conflicts - political, social and economic - are addressed. The conventional illusion is that terrorism must be justified by oppressed people seeking to achieve their goals and consequently the argument advanced by “freedom fighters” anywhere, “give me liberty and I will give you death,” should be tolerated if not glorified. This traditional rationalization of “sacred” violence often conceals that the real purpose of terrorist groups is to gain political power through the barrel of the gun, in violation of fundamental human rights of the noncombatant segment of societies. For instance, Palestinians religious movements [e.g., Hamas, Islamic Jihad] and secular entities [such as Fatah’s Tanzim and Aqsa Martyr Brigades]] wish not only to resolve national grievances [such as Jewish settlements, right of return, Jerusalem] but primarily to destroy the Jewish state. Similarly, Osama bin Laden’s international network not only opposes the presence of American military in the Arabian Peninsula and Iraq, but its stated objective is to “unite all Muslims and establish a government that follows the rule of the Caliphs.” The second myth is that strong action against terrorist infrastructure [leaders, recruitment, funding, propaganda, training, weapons, operational command and control] will only increase terrorism. The argument here is that law-enforcement efforts and military retaliation inevitably will fuel more brutal acts of violent revenge. Clearly, if this perception continues to prevail, particularly in democratic societies, there is the danger it will paralyze governments and thereby encourage further terrorist attacks. In sum, past experience provides useful lessons for a realistic future strategy. The </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">prudent application of force</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> has been demonstrated to be </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">an effective tool for short- and long-term deterrence of terrorism.</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">For example, Israel’s targeted killing of Mohammed Sider, the Hebron commander of the Islamic Jihad, defused a “ticking bomb.” The assassination of Ismail Abu Shanab - a top Hamas leader in the Gaza Strip who was directly responsible for several suicide bombings including the latest bus attack in Jerusalem - disrupted potential terrorist operations. Similarly, the U.S. military operation in Iraq eliminated Saddam Hussein’s regime as a state sponsor of terror. Thus, it behooves those countries victimized by terrorism to understand a cardinal message communicated by Winston Churchill to the House of Commons on May 13, 1940: “Victory at all costs, victory in spite of terror, victory however long and hard the road may be: For without victory, there is no survival.” </span><br />

According to Asahi News, such a freeze would please Japan’s radical Social Democratic Party, but would raise the ire of Washington, resulting in a further delay in the transfer of 8,000 U.S. Marines to Guam. This latest development comes only a week after a visit to Tokyo by Congresswoman Madeleine Z. Bordallo during which she was assured by the government of Japan that it remains committed to carrying out the terms of the bilateral agreement signed by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and then-Japanese Foreign Minister Hirofumi Nakasone in Feb. 2009. “During our meetings, we discussed the Guam military build-up where I received assurances that Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan and his government are working to resolve build-up related issues internally and that they are fully committed to the terms of the Guam International Agreement. I will continue to work with my colleagues in Congress and the Obama administration to ensure that the military build-up is done right and that both governments continue to implement the terms of the Guam International Agreement,” said Bordallo who participated in the 44th U.S.-Japan Legislative Exchange Program. </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">If the budget for Futenma-</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">related </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">projects are frozen, this will further delay the Guam buildup which is already delayed up to 2020.</span></u><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The United States has asked Japan to help shoulder hundreds of millions of dollars in additional fees to transfer Marines from a controversial base on Okinawa island to Guam, Kyodo news agency reported. The extra money -- needed to help pay for electricity, water and sewage facilities at the new site -- could add further uncertainty to the future of Marine Corps Air Station Futenma, which has strained the security alliance that Japan and the U.S. sealed 50 years ago. </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Debate over a relocation plan for the base</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, which currently sits in the middle of a city on Okinawa, </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">led to repeated mass protests and was a major factor in</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Prime Minister Yukio </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Hatoyama's resignation </span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">last month. Under the existing deal, 8,000 Marines and their dependents will move to the U.S. territory of Guam and some facilities will shift to a less populated part of the Japanese island. Japan agreed in 2006 to pay more than $6 billion of the $10 billion the move was expected to cost. U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates asked Tokyo last month to help pick up the tab for the higher-than-expected infrastructure costs at the new base, Kyodo news said, citing unnamed diplomatic sources. Kyodo said that would likely cost Japan an additional tens of billions of yen (hundreds of millions of dollars). </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The country's massive debt and struggling economy are a major issue in national elections</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">set for this month,</span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"> and any additional financial burden for the already sensitive </span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Okinawa</span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"> base issue would draw strong criticism at home</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><br />

At these rates, Abercrombie says, stateside construction workers will be willing to travel to Guam for jobs. According to the Associated General Contractors of America, the U.S. construction industry lost 1 million jobs in the year ending in August 2009. Arizona suffered the biggest percentage decline — losing 50,000 construction jobs, or nearly 27 percent of its total. Hawaii lost about 5,100 construction jobs — 13.6 of its total — over the same period. Abercrombie's detractors have portrayed his Guam proposal as pandering to workers back home as he prepares to run for governor of Hawaii. But Helfert, Abercrombie’s spokesman, said the amendment was “not just aimed at Hawaii workers. It makes sense if you have people out of work to create jobs for them — whether it’s in California, Nevada, Arizona or Oregon.” Tight budgets, tough talks Even though the Abercrombie proposal can be cast as stimulus money, it would add to costs at a time when the U.S. is struggling to contain military spending while fighting two foreign wars and contending with growing demand for veterans’ services. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the</span> <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">wage hike would drive up the Guam project by about $10 billion</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">That</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">’s a change some think </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">could complicate already prickly talks over the </span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">military</span> <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">realignment with</span></u> <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Japan’s newly elected leaders, who have taken a more nationalistic stance and threatened to withdraw financial and logistical support </span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">for various U.S. military operations. “Given all that is going on … spending an extra $10 billion seems very unlikely,” said Todd Harrison, a fellow for defense budget studies at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments in Washington, D.C. “Also, we are in this jointly with the Japanese. If we throw in some requirement to pay these </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">higher wage rates</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and 70 percent of the labor force has to be U.S. citizens that</span> <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">could cause the Japanese to reconsider their role</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.” The move to bring in U.S. workers by </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">raising wages has met </span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">with</span> <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">fierce resistance from contractors in Guam, who benefit from the ability to use temporary foreign workers under the H2B visa program</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Since the 1950s, most major construction projects in Guam have employed foreign workers — primarily from the Philippines — who live in barracks provided by contractors and then return home when the job is done. There is no union for construction workers in Guam, nor is there a system of unemployment to assist local workers during dry spells — both factors in a persistent shortage of construction workers in the territory. “The temporary workers and H2B workers really fit for Guam,” said James Martinez, president of the Guam Contractors Association. At the moment there are about 1,800 “guest workers” in Guam, or about a quarter of the total construction workforce, according to the Guam Department of Labor. That number swelled to about 6,000 during a construction boom fueled by Japanese investment in the 1990s, and a U.S. military official visiting Guam last year predicted that </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">about 12,000 temporary workers would be needed </span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">to work on the base project. </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Recruiters are already active in the Philippines, with some trumpeting up to 50,000 job opportunities on the base project</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and other construction on Guam sparked by the U.S. buildup. “Certainly there’s no closed door for workers from the U.S.,” said Martinez. But he said his organization opposes putting a quota for American workers or hiking wages to assist unemployed construction workers elsewhere in the United States. “Unfortunately we can’t be the answer to the economic woes of Hawaii or the rest of the U.S.,” he said. “We don’t want to be forced to pay wages that don’t fit our economy.” ‘Effects... could be disastrous’ Guam Gov. Felix Camacho and the territory’s sole representative in Congress, Madeleine Bordallo, also oppose the Abercrombie amendment. “If wages were to go up on military construction projects, we risk taking government of Guam employees out of their jobs and working in the construction industry,” said Matthew Herrmann, press secretary for Bordallo. “The socioeconomic effects on Guam could be disastrous.” Supporters of Abercrombie’s proposal also argue that the wage increase is long overdue. “The business community in Guam has consistently used </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">H2B workers</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> to </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">drive down wages in Guam</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">,” said Matt Rector, a territory senator who heads Guam’s labor committee as well as the Guam Teacher’s Union, which represents public sector workers. </span><br />

Fourteen years ago, the United States offered to move the base to quell rising anti-American fervor after three U.S. servicemembers abducted and raped a 12-year-old Okinawa girl. The move was supposed to show that the Japanese and U.S. governments were serious about reducing the American bases that cover one-fifth of the island. But relocation efforts stalled due to environmental concerns and other wrangling over alternative sites, even after new impetus for the move came in 2004 when a Marine helicopter crashed into a university building just outside Futenma’s fence.

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Of equal concern is the possible reemergence of an authoritarian dictatorship in Russia under President Putin or a successor, whether ultranationalist or Communist. Our in-depth analysis of President Putin has included insights into his personal development, his work in the Soviet foreign intelligence service (KGB), and his actions since assuming the presidency of Russia on January 1, 2000. Putin is an intelligent, disciplined, and systematic leader, determined to assure that Russia is, in his words, a &quot;strong state,&quot; under a &quot;dictatorship of law&quot; and that Russia has a major role in the world.' Putin declares his support for political democracy and movement toward a market-oriented economy, but the evidence to date suggests that Russia is gradually moving toward a more autocratic path.

<strong>Russian expansionism causes global nuclear war</strong> <br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Much is at stake in Eurasia for the U.S. and its allies</span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">. Attempts to restore its empire will doom Russia's transition to a democracy</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and free-market economy. The ongoing war in Chechnya alone has cost Russia $6 billion to date (equal to Russia's IMF and World Bank loans for 1995). Moreover, it has extracted a tremendous price from Russian society. The</span> <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">wars </span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">which would be required </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">to restore the Russian empire would prove</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">much more </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">costly</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> not just </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">for Russia and the region</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, but </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">for peace, world stability, and security</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. As the former Soviet arsenals are spread throughout the NIS, </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">these conflicts may escalate to include the use of w</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">eapons of</span> <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">m</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">ass </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">d</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">estruction. Scenarios including unauthorized missile launches are especially threatening. Moreover, if successful, </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">a reconstituted Russian empire would become a major destabilizing influence</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> both in Eurasia and </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">throughout the world</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. It would endanger not only Russia's neighbors, but also the U.S. and its allies in Europe and the Middle East. And, of course, a neo-imperialist Russia could imperil the oil reserves of the Persian Gulf.15 Domination of the Caucasus would bring Russia closer to the Balkans, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Middle East. Russian imperialists, such as radical nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, have resurrected the old dream of obtaining a warm port on the Indian Ocean. If Russia succeeds in establishing its domination in the south, the threat to Ukraine, Turkey, Iran, and Afganistan will increase. The independence of pro-Western Georgia and Azerbaijan already has been undermined by pressures from the Russian armed forces and covert actions by the intelligence and security services, in addition to which Russian hegemony would make Western political and economic efforts to stave off Islamic militancy more difficult. Eurasian oil resources are pivotal to economic development in the early 21st century. The supply of Middle Eastern oil would become precarious if Saudi Arabia became unstable, or if Iran or Iraq provoked another military conflict in the area. Eurasian oil is also key to the economic development of the southern NIS. Only with oil revenues can these countries sever their dependence on Moscow and develop modern market economies and free societies. Moreover, if these vast oil reserves were tapped and developed, tens of thousands of U.S. and Western jobs would be created. The U.S. should ensure free access to these reserves for the benefit of both Western and local economies. </span><br />
