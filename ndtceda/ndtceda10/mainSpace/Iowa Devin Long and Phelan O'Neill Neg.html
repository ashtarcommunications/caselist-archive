<strong>(A) Interp – Aff must affect all visas under one of the 4 areas and not specify a specific visa.</strong><br />
<strong>The syntax of the resolution requires this:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>(1) Visas is a count noun because of “s”</strong><br />
<strong>Using English, ‘2</strong> (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.usingenglish.com/glossary/count-noun.html" rel="nofollow">www.usingenglish.com/glossary/count-noun.html</a>)<br />
A Count Noun is a noun that has <br />
AND <br />
made by the addition of '-s'.<br />
<br />
<strong>(2) Lack of an article preceding the four visa areas means the resolution refers to the whole class of each visa area, not a specific visa program.</strong><br />
<strong><span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">Cowan, '8 </span>(MATESL program -- Illinois Champaign Urbana, The Teacher's Grammar of English, pg. 215 &amp; 668)</strong><br />
Zero Article Those instances in which count and noncount <br />
AND <br />
of a class. (Tigers are dangerous)<br />
<br />
<strong>(B) Aff violates – they affect a specific visa and not the whole class. Generic reference requires references to the whole class and not a specific instance of that class.</strong><br />
<strong><span class="StyleStyleBold12pt">Cruse, '6 </span></strong>(Manchester Lingustics Professor, A glossary of Semantics and Pragmatics, pg. 73)<br />
generic reference This is where reference is made <br />
AND <br />
are only true of the class as whole.<br />
<br />
<strong>(C) Voters</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>1) Grammatical Precision -- Aff ignores zero article rule– the word visas in the resolution requires a generalization of each of the four areas, not a specific visa. Grammar is the gateway to all other standards – Predictability is impossible if we don’t establish resolutional meaning</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>(2) Limits –hundreds visa programs under each area, and some programs only affect a handful of people. This makes generating negative ground impossible.</strong><br />
