Observation One is the Status Quo<br />
<br />
A.) By all media and United Nations accounts, the recent Pakistani floods are now the worst catastrophe in recorded history. Millions are at risk from disease and hunger. While many around the world opened their wallets to the victims in Haiti and Asia, few have been willing to do the same for suffering population of Pakistan. The situation threatens the stability of a strategically located nation that is already strained by the weight of extremists within its borders.<br />

B.) Pakistani visa services have empirically been suspended amid security concerns, dramatically limiting the number of visas granted to Pakistanis seeking work in the United States.<br />

C.) Remittances, which are defined as transfers of money between migrants and the families they have left behind, are currently dismissed and underutilized in the struggle for acute economic and disaster relief. Humanitarian agencies and other actors ignore the pivotal role that remittances can play in the struggle to combat poverty.<br />

PLAN TEXT<br />
Resolved: the United States Federal Government should grant employment-based immigrant visas to up to 50,000 Pakistanis. <br />
<br />
Observation Two is Solvency<br />
A.) Economists agree that increasing remittances to Pakistanis from abroad is the single best way to stimulate the Pakistani economy, give a lifeline to the country’s poor and avoid the tangles of government corruption.<br />

B.) employment based immigrant visas, issued to a limited number of people in countries struck by economic and natural disasters, would be the ultimate form of disaster relief.<br />

<br />
Trafficking Advantage<br />
<br />
A.) Pakistani flooding and that lack of distributed resources has lead to the looming threat of large scale human trafficking. Aid organizations are not equip to handle the impending crisis and without more resources distributed directly to residents, millions of women and children are at risk of being trafficked.<br />

C.) HUMAN TRAFFICKING IS THE ULTIMATE FORM OF DEHUMANIZATION<br />

D.) The dehumanizing motivations that legitimize and foster human rights abuses, like those occurring in Pakistan, is at the root cause of war and conflict. It permeates all ATROCITIES and until it is addressed we will continue to see a cycle of suffering and violence.<br />
Berube ’97 (David, Ph.D. in Communications, “Nanotechnological Prolongevity: The Down Side”, NanoTechnology Magazine, June/July 1997, p. 1-6, URL: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cla.sc.edu/ENGL/faculty/berube/prolong.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cla.sc.edu/ENGL/faculty/berube/prolong.htm</a><br />
E.) Additionally, the affirmative takes a specific stance against the human rights abuses that are carried out every day in Afghanistan. This recognition of the plan is critical as it is the language of rights that empowers people’s movements to make demands upon their societies.<br />

F.) Remittances solve better than aid- they avoid corruption and overhead. They also help to solve migrant trafficking, which simple foreign aid cannot.<br />
