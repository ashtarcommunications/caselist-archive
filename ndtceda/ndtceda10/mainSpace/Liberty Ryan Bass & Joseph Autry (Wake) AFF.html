<span style="margin-left: 0.25in; page-break-after: avoid;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">1. Heteronormativity is the root cause of all their MPX</span></strong></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 40.5pt; page-break-after: avoid;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Heteronormativity dictates that those who do not fit the mode of a white heterosexual male are “different” and therefore should be eradicated or forced to conform to this image. Winnubst 06 indicates that it is rooting in the masculine that that allows for the calculative and militaristic expressions that causes us to devalue the “other.” Tatchell 89 says that it is only once we accept this devaluing that oppression and domination of the “other” and the impacts of the negative can occur. </span></strong></span><br />

<span style="page-break-after: avoid;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">A. Hurts 2AC Strategy- multiple advocacies skews 2AC strategy because we can’t read our best offense without having it taken away by another position- destroys ground and education- </span></strong></span><br />

<br />
<span style="page-break-after: avoid;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The kritik alternative can morph into a floating PIC because of its vagueness. They will morph their alternative to include the plan, which is bad because:</span></strong></span><br />
<span style="page-break-after: avoid;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">1. Ground loss—</span></strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">they moot the 1AC and eliminate any ability to generate offense by including the plan in the alternative</span></span><br />
<span style="page-break-after: avoid;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">2. Strategy skew—</span></strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">the negative’s shifting of their advocacy from the 1NC and what their authors say changes in response to our arguments, so we can never gain any offense</span></span><br />
<span style="page-break-after: avoid;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">3. Time skew—</span></strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">floating PICs essentially moot the 1AC as well as 2AC, blowing up the negative’s time advantage and decimating the 1AR</span></span><br />

<span style="page-break-after: avoid;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Plan solves this distinction a few ways:</span></strong></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.25in;">1. Brown indicates that currently our heteronormative immigration policies are the biopolitics that restrict the “Queer” into a particular place forcing them to exclusion—This is what creates the static notion of the American nation-state—The plan “queers” the notion of American identity thereby deconstructing the very thing they critique.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.25in;">2. Schneider, 04 indicates the Aff challenges the way in which conceptual base operates, opening up space for the deconstruction of global heteronormativity. Mittelstaedt indicates that through the Supreme Court ruling on international law Heteronormativity is challenged on both the domestic and international level </span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.25in; page-break-after: avoid;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">3. Copelon, 99 indicates that this incorporation international law standards of human rights into US law is critical to countering domination and notion that Americas way is the best and only way though shattering the myth of US superiority</span></strong></span><br />
