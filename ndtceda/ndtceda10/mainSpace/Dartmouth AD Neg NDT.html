2NC AT: Semiconductors<br />
1. Offshoring increases US semiconductor competitiveness compared to<br />
Asian rivals<br />

Work, Technology, and Society, IRLE at the University of California,<br />

History suggests that the move offshore helped keep U.S. chip firms<br />
competitive with … against international rivals, albeit at the expense<br />
of specific jobs in the short run.<br />
<br />
2. Offshoring helps US semiconductor companies innovate twice as fast<br />
by getting more hours of work each day<br />

• Reduced development time: … combined into one product there by<br />
reducing time if each module were to be done one by one.<br />

3. Faster innovation turns military semiconductors. The US military<br />
can use innovations developed by US companies overseas – even<br />
innovations made by other countries help the US<br />

The United States, according to my analysis, has more than …supply of<br />

5. Neither the plan nor offshoring will affect military<br />
semiconductors. Immigrants can’t get past export controls<br />

One way the Pentagon is responding to all this is by getting more<br />
involved in chip manufacturing…..&quot;The commercial world won't do it,&quot;<br />
said Glum. &quot;We will.&quot;<br />

7. Semiconductor companies will offshore to India, not China<br />
