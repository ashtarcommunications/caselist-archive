Note: There may be minor changes to this wording, but the plan action will stay the same.<br />

Advantage One is Competitiveness<br />
<br />
Eliminating the H-1B cap is key to US competitiveness? labor mobility is the vital internal link to overcoming the recession.<br />

<br />
The expiration of the 2008 cap on the first day of the application window is clear evidence that the current cap?one important step<br />
<br />
It?s key to innovation and job growth ? continued cap makes offshoring inevitable.<br />

Facing the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, analysts at the World Bank and the US Central Intelligence Agency are just beginning to contemplate ?against the international system.<br />
<br />
That goes nuclear.<br />

It?s important that we avoid all these policy errors ? not just for the sake of our prosperity, but for our survival. The Great Depression, ? an even greater scale.<br />

Only increasing the flow of high-skill immigrants can preserve US military leadership ? key to tech innovation.<br />

<br />
Can the United States maintain ?many talented foreigners out.<br />

US leadership prevents multiple scenarios for nuclear conflict ? prefer it to all other alternatives<br />

<br />
Finally, there is the United States itself. As a matter of national policy stretching back across numerous administrations, Democratic and Republican, liberal and conservative, Americans have insisted ?provide an easier path.<br />
<br />
Only removing the cap can solve ? retaining any cap causes business uncertainty, declining competitiveness, and offshoring.<br />

Despite its proven usefulness, the current H-1B visa program ? source of skilled human capital. n142<br />

We?ll preempt your economy offense - Their wages arguments are based on poor studies ? new evidence proves that increased visas boost the US economy and don?t trade off with American jobs.<br />

<br />
Proponents of the H-1B visa ? &quot;attractive locales for off-shoring.&quot;<br />
<br />
Advantage 2 is Trade<br />
<br />
Doha has stalled --- but freshly negotiated deals are still possible<br />
Vasudeva ?10 (Pran,- trade Professor Icfai Business School, Chandigarh July 31st ?New Dynamic in Doha Talks? <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/view/173261" rel="nofollow">http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/view/173261</a>)<br />
<br />
A &quot;new dynamic&quot; has emerged in the Doha ?many divisions in the talks remain.<br />
<br />
<br />
Specifically, there?s no deal on service liberalization now. This is because the U.S. won?t credibly budge on Mode 4.<br />
Cooper ?10 (William,- specialist in International Trade and Finance for the CRS ?Trade in Services? April 7th <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/142770.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/142770.pdf</a>)<br />
<br />
Mode-4 delivery, temporary entry of supply personnel, has become one of the most controversial issues ? entering the United States<br />
<br />
Mode-4 commitments key to services negotiations ? prevents developing country concessions in other areas.<br />
International Trade Reporter ?5 (22 Int'l Trade Rep. (BNA) 212 Lexis)<br />
<br />
The U.S. business community is stepping up pressure on the Bush administration to move more aggressively to spur progress in the so-called Mode 4 talks ?developed-country offers on Mode 4.?<br />
<br />
<br />
H-1Bs are key ? they?re the most valuable Mode 4 commitment and unlock Mode 3.<br />
Wallach and Tucker ?6 (Lori,- Director of Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch division Todd,- research director with Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch ?Debunking the Myth of Mode 4 and the U.S. H-1B Visa Program? <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.citizen.org/documents/Mode_Four_H1B_Visa_Memo.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.citizen.org/documents/Mode_Four_H1B_Visa_Memo.pdf</a>)<br />
<br />
Mode 4 refers to delivery of services by movement of natural persons from one country to another to perform a service.2 A bloc of developing countries ? seeking additional Mode 4 access.<br />
<br />
Alt causes from the ag topic don?t cut it ? Credible Mode 4 actions unlock Mode 3 and unlock other Doha issues. This also causes energy service deals.<br />
James ?9 (Sallie,- trade policy analyst @ Cato 2-4 ?A Service to the Economy Removing Barriers to ?Invisible Trade??)<br />
<br />
That is ironic, because services liberalization through the WTO ?for them to sign off on a deal, too.<br />
<br />
Even if we can?t save Doha ? the plan still can spur an energy side deal<br />
