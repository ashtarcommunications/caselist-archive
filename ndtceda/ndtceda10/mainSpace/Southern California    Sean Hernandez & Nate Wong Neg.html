Free competition in the productions of goods… they will only rarely be assassinated.<br />
<br />
The Alternative: Peacefully secede from and practice noncooperation with the democratic state.<br />
<br />
Personal secession is the only effective policy of social revolution. This must be part of an ideological campaign of delegitimizing the institution of democratic government among the public, and it must start with the intellectual elite. That elite must communicate its ideas to the public in the course of a systematic struggle against democracy.<br />

 The United States federal government should redistribute federal r&amp;d money and allow university faculty members and employees of federal labs to have decision-making authority over the licensing of their discoveries as per our Litan evidence.<br />

The United States federal government should restructure the federal budget to include a separate capital investment budget used for long term public investments such as pensions, clean energy, infrastructure, education, information technology, space launch and travel technology, asteroid deflection technology.<br />
<br />
The United States federal government should pass legislation prohibiting the use of any American military or commercial object orbiting or transiting through space from being used as a weapon. The President of the United States should make public announcement emphasizing and appraising this new policy. <br />

The United States federal government will announce to China, India, Russia, and generally to countries that could challenge American unipolarity that the United States has no interest in going to war with those countries and will end forward deployment of its troops near those countries.

 Baudrillard argues that signs of the real are more real than the real itself. Which is why he wrote the book The Gulf War Didn’t Happen, asserting that the real war paled in significance to the media-driven simulation of the war. What he didn’t understand is that that media simulation of the war pales in comparison to the computer simulation we are living in. <br />

Historical simulations can be created...long range planning beyond 2050 would be futile. <br />

In view of the growing supremacy of the object we have to abandon the subject and completely side with the object. Our argument demonstrates that we are not subjects at all.

 The aff identifies language as the cause and solution, seeking to linguistically reinvent the world – it wants to think differently about something that is determined by MANY DIFFERENT forces larger than the way we speak about them. For them, discourse is the final end point – as long as we talk about it differently, then we will be different. But language can only go so far.<br />
MOONEY, Roehampton University, 06 (ANNABELLE, International Journal for the Semiotics of Law, WHEN A WOMAN NEEDS TO BE SEEN, HEARD AND WRITTEN AS A WOMAN: RAPE, LAW AND AN ARGUMENT AGAINST GENDER NEUTRAL LANGUAGE)<br />
However, to change the linguistic evidence...other sites of violence, will be forgotten. <br />
<br />
Simply referencing discourse as a means to prevent material oppression is just linguistic trickery – making discourse the grounding point for politics is what Marx deemed as “phrase fighters” – we can’t just wish away problems by focusing on their discursive implications.<br />

 The United States Congress should amend the statutory grounds for asylum status to include human trafficking as a basis for an asylum claim. Trafficking should be defined so that the consent of the trafficked person is irrelevant to their status. <br />
<br />
The counterplan is a better discursive strategy for addressing the trafficking problem. It treats trafficked persons as rational actors and doesn’t make distinctions between “good” and “bad” immigrants.<br />

 We advocate mestiza consciousness and the breakdown of oppressive structures of society that place people into the borderlands as a metaphor that applies to our inner psyches, but only for the purpose of transforming communities<br />
<br />
The net benefit is psyche politics – Your authors pretend to know unconscious and conscious behaviors and patterns that shape psychological borders. The idea that anyone can know the psychology of everyone that inhabits the borderlands is unprovable. The idea that “cultural crossbreeding will create a culture of love and harmony” is wishful thinking and pop psychology.<br />

 A. Interpretation: The aff must increase the cap to a specific quantity<br />
<br />
Increase means to make greater in number<br />
Dictionary.com 2010<br />
–verb (used with object)<br />
1.to make greater, as in number, size, strength, or quality; augment; add to: to increase taxes.<br />
<br />
Number requires a specific countable quantity<br />
American Heritage Stedman's Medical Dictionary, 2002<br />
[“Number” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/number" rel="nofollow">http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/number</a>]:<br />
num•ber (nŭm'bər) n.1. A symbol expressive of a certain value or of a specific quantity determined by count.<br />
<br />
B. Violation: The plan eliminates the cap all together. They don’t increase the number, they eliminate the number.<br />
<br />
Eliminating the cap is distinct from increasing the number of visas<br />
Daniel Kowalski, 2008 [editor-in-Chief of Bender's Immigration Bulletin, 21 Geo. J. Legal Ethics 37]:<br />
But Judge Katzmann's essay...by U.S. consular officers overseas<br />
<br />
C. Standards:<br />
<br />
1) Ground – maintaining the cap is key to making the sliding scale and other similar counterplans competitive. It’s also key to politics links about adjusting the cap. These are core of the topic arguments that are relevant. Their plan is designed to dodge the key topic specific discussions. Additionally, banning the cap ought to be neg ground since it is linked to the resolution’s use of the word number.<br />
<br />
2) Mixing Burdens – if the number of visas doesn’t refer to the cap, it is impossible for the aff to fiat an increase without relying on solvency to prove that they are topical. This guts predictability which is key to topic specific negative strategies which are more fair, more educational, and more fun.<br />
<br />
3) Topical version of their plan solves all of their offense – they could just set the cap at some extremely large number like 1 billion – this would allow them to read the same aff while solving our neg ground concerns<br />
<br />
D. Topicality is a voting issue for reasons of competitive equity.<br />

The Commission should be given the authority to set the cap on H-1B visas. Congress should have a maximum of 90 days to review the Committee’s recommendation and choose to vote to overturn the Committee’s recommendations and set a different cap. <br />
The Commission should have a maximum of one year to issue a recommendation. <br />

 A. Good immigrants<br />
Even if the state no longer defaults to stable notions of the family to justify visas, it will still only let in partners or couples who represent good neoliberal citizens. The aff just re-solidifies the distinction between who should be illegal by providing the state a a new non-heteronormative humanitarian justification<br />

I also examine how recognized couple relationships...immigrants and its associated logics of violence<br />
<br />
The aff doesn’t just strike down an exclusion, it also justifies including certain people under the umbrella terms of the family. Even if you get rid of all family eligibility restrictions, overall visa restrictions will remain. New applicants will still have to be financially responsible and seek inclusion and affirmation by the state. Even though the aff expands the family category, the notion of a good immigrant will structure the effects of the plan. The aff will still reinforce neo-liberal citizenship.<br />
