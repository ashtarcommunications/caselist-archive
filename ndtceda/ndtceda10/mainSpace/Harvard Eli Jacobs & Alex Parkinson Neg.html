The military weaponization of interpreters makes language nothing but neutral conduits to translate Other cultures into our colonial understanding. This programmatic weaponization of language has roots back to the Cold War and has culminated in the obliteration of other cultures and the endless American global colonial project <br />
Rafael ‘9 (Vincente L., Prof. of History @ U. of Washington, “Translation, American English, and the National Insecurities of Empire” Social Text 101, Vol. 27.4, bb) <br />
In this essay, I want to focus on the United States to … a common national speech: English. <br />
<br />
This linguistic imperialism is the root cause of terrorism and violence and will culminate in the absolute obliteration of society if we do not begin to counter the spread of english linguistic hegemony <br />
Qiang and Wolff ‘5 (Niu, Ph.D, and Martin, J.D., “ENGLISH as a FOREIGN LANGUAGE: The Modern Day Trojan Horse?” English Today, Cambridge Press, bb) <br />
*Some spelling errors fixed for clarity of English <br />
This is also reminiscent of the arrogant and … through linguistic imperialism. <br />
<br />
Our alternative is to reject the 1AC in favor of a destructive genealogy of the role of military orientalism in contemporary operations. <br />
Only our refusal to be at home with English and the interrogation of how American language itself has eliminated and obscured other forms of being in the world will allow us to break down the dangerous orientalism that makes warfare inevitable and begins a movement towards a new politics <br />

It's that time of year again. Graduating … years until the economy—and their portfolios—pick up. <br />

Health care reform will lead to more training of doctors <br />
Ezra Klein, economics and domestic policy writer, Washington Post, 8/13/2009, “Do We Have Enough Doctors For Health-Care Reform?” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2009/08/do_we_have_enough_doctors_for.html" rel="nofollow">http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2009/08/do_we_have_enough_doctors_for.html</a> <br />
There are a couple of things to say … insurmountable challenge by any means. <br />
<br />
<strong>1NC Nurses CP</strong><br />
The United States federal government should <br />
-fund a high school nursing recruitment program <br />
-subsidize a nurse wage increase, <br />
-establish mandatory staffing ratios, and <br />
-ban mandatory overtime. <br />
<br />
The CP solves – first, poor wages and staffing ratios are the root cause of the nurse shortage – not lack of trained RNs <br />
Lafer 05, Gordon Lafer, Associate Professor, Labor Resource and Education Center, UOregon, Spring 2005, “Hospital Speedups and the Fiction of a Nursing Shortage,” Labor Studies Journal, 30.1, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.uoregon.edu/~lerc/public/pdfs/hospitalspeed.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.uoregon.edu/~lerc/public/pdfs/hospitalspeed.pdf</a> <br />
By contrast, nurses themselves have called for … trained professionals out of their chosen careers. <br />
<br />
Second, education programs reach out to minorities and men – expanding representation <br />
Brenda Nevidjon et al, Associate Clinical Professor in the Health Systems Leadership and Outcomes Division of Duke University School of Nursing, 2001, “The Nursing Shortage: Solutions for the Short and Long Term,” OJIN, Vol. 6, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nursingworld.org/MainMenuCategories/ANAMarketplace/ANAPeriodicals/OJIN/TableofContents/Volume62001/No1Jan01/NursingShortageSolutions.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.nursingworld.org/MainMenuCategories/ANAMarketplace/ANAPeriodicals/OJIN/TableofContents/Volume62001/No1Jan01/NursingShortageSolutions.aspx</a> <br />
Within the general student recruitment initiates … of nursing for students is important. <br />
<br />
2NC <br />
There’s no short-term shortage, and the CP solves long-run issues <br />

WE ANTICIPATE THAT THE CONTINUING … the size of the future RN workforce. <br />
<br />
Improved working conditions can quickly end the shortage – there’s an excess of reserve nurses <br />
Lafer 05, Gordon Lafer, Associate Professor, Labor Resource and Education Center, UOregon, Spring 2005, “Hospital Speedups and the Fiction of a Nursing Shortage,” Labor Studies Journal, 30.1, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.uoregon.edu/~lerc/public/pdfs/hospitalspeed.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.uoregon.edu/~lerc/public/pdfs/hospitalspeed.pdf</a> <br />
Despite the dire projections, there is not … the so-called &quot;shortage&quot; could evaporate in little time. <br />

Chen Luo ‘9 MA, Department of Sociology, Queen’s University Kingston, Ontario, Canada (“BECOMING “SUBJECTS” OF THE VISA REGIME: HOW THE BAN-OPTICON OF THE CANADIAN VISA SYSTEM AFFECTS CHINESE APPLICANTS” Masters Thesis) <br />
The last point I would like to mention is that… functioning mechanism of governmental power. <br />
<br />
Governments develop amnesty strategies to allow a certain degree of “fuzziness” regarding eligibility. This lets them deport whoever they want. <br />
Epstein and Weiss, Professors of Economics at Bar-Ilan University , 2001 <br />

<br />
Overidentification CP <br />
The United States federal government should legislate that all visa holders do not have regularized immigration status. <br />
Solvency<br />
The CP overconforms with the category the aff criticizes – this destroys the seductiveness of enforcing these distinctions – solves the aff <br />
Krips, Prof. @ Univ. of Pittsburgh, 2004, Henry, “COUCHING POLITICS: ZIZEK’S RULES FOR RADICALS,” from Psychoanalysis, Culture &amp; Society, Pg. 126-141 <br />
The residual question, then, is the second … will falter for lack of broader public interest in sustaining it. <br />

Koepnick ’99 [Lutz, Ass. Prof. of German studies at Washington University of St. Louis, Moderism/Modernity, 6.1, 1999] <br />
Very well Benjamin's famous catchphrase of fascism as the aestheticization … across existing lines of ethnic, social, or gender difference. <br />
<br />
Understanding society to be determined totally by a force like bureaucracy is not a neutral description, but one that actively limits space to act, making totalitarianism the only possible mode of politics <br />
Bruno Latour, Prof. and Vice President for Research @ Paris Institute of Political Studies, 2005, Reassembling the Social, Oxford UP, p. 250-53 <br />
But no matter how respectable these reasons may appear… allowed by birthright to decide what it should consist of. <br />

T - Temporary Visa = H visa 1NC<br />
1NC T – Temporary Visas = H <br />
As defined by the government, only H visas are ‘temporary worker’ visas. There are a ton of other nonimmigrant visas <br />

3. ‘Temporary’ means that there’s a definite end of a particular job – any alternate definition makes all jobs meet temporary <br />
JOHN P. ELWOOD, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, 12/18/2008, “MEANING OF “TEMPORARY” WORK UNDER 8 U.S.C. § 1101(A)(15)(H)(II)(B),” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.justice.gov/olc/2008/dhs-temp-worker.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.justice.gov/olc/2008/dhs-temp-worker.pdf</a> <br />
Finally, our 1987 opinion recognized that “… for the worker is temporary. <br />
<br />
B. Violation – the aff doesn’t increase H visas – O visa is dual purpose and can be extended indefinitely <br />

<br />
--increases the cap for a visa whose cap is not currently met, guaranteeing no increase in stamps given out<br />
<br />
--makes visas more attractive, which increases the number of stamps only effectually, or not a t all if the cap would other be met. Effects topicality is bad—it allows them to read plan mechanisms that spike our generic DA links, making increase CP ground useless without net benefits.<br />

 Border Homogenization K - GSU Rd. 2<br />
<br />
Hundreds of countries, with thousands upon thousands of states and counties, cities and provinces, and everyone with its own little strip of border. <br />
But what is a border? When we talk about the border of a page, the border between our bodies and minds, we are still using the same word: border. When the affirmative connects the line between normal and abnormal sexuality, between different parts of our minds, and the policed territory between the United States and the rest of the world, they lay all these lines on top of another and give them one name. <br />
But every one of these lines is different, it requires different practices and different words to be reproduced and given force. The affirmative’s representations ultimately homogenize all borders into one metaphorical border, taking the uniqueness and difference present at every border and reducing it to something analogous to themselves. THEIR particular border becomes ALL borders. This ideological imperialism not only reduces the diversity of the other to what is analogous to the self, it also produces a utopian politics that ignores the complex ways resistance itself is produced in power relations, and reproduces a universalist politics that replicates colonialist practices <br />
Vila, Associate Professor of Sociology at the University of Texas at San Antonio, 2005 [Pablo, “Conclusion: The Limits of American Border Theory,” Ethnography at the Border, Ed. Pablo Vila, p.307-315] <br />
After dominating the field for some … outside, in principle, unclosable&quot; (15).7 <br />
<br />
Moreover, treating debate itself as a borderland that links geographically and ideologically different borders leads to a shallow politics that cannot produce change—instead of contact with actual others, debate becomes a detour that teaches us to enjoy communicating this metaphor of the border, while flattening out and detaching us from specific political contests <br />
Ang, Prof. of Cultural Studies at the University of Western Sydney, Nepean, 1998 [Ien, “Doing cultural studies at the crossroads,” European Journal of Cultural Studies 1(1), p. 18-20] <br />
It is this paradox that I find myself in … own field of particularity.4 <br />
<br />
Ultimately, this reduction of diverse borders to a universal metaphor is a smoothing out of differences to make compelx lives fit into our politics. This smoothing out of all differences is precisely what authorizes the normalizing violence of societies—this fantasy world has always been the ideology that begins to eliminate that which does not fit—like Stalin and Hitler, we begin by eliminating groups, and end by wishing for the elimination of everything <br />
Bogard, Professor of Sociology at Whitman, 2000 [William, “Smoothing Machines and the Constitution of Society,” Cultural Studies 14 (2), 269-275] <br />
Introduction <br />
<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">IMAGINE SOCIERY AT A </span>…. What survival? No one has ever survived! <br />
<br />
The alternative we will advocate is twofold: <br />
First, we advocate abandoning the metaphor for a critique of the real things—we do not reject their representations of violence on any specific border, we reject the smoothing out of these two specific borders in the metaphorical border of the 1AC. We must invert the comparison of the 1AC, emphasizing the disconnections and specificity of each instance. Only then can we analyze each border to see how it specifically, not metaphorically, involves us <br />
Ang, Professor of Cultural Studies at the University of Western Sydney, Nepean, 1998 [Ien, “Doing cultural studies at the crossroads,” European Journal of Cultural Studies 1(1), p. 27-28] <br />
As I have already suggested, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">an </span>… can usefully begin to interrogate and highlight. <br />
<br />
Second, Foregrounding—An absolute explication of how our critique is affiliated with our personal selves is impossible, because there are always forces which have coopted both us and the voices of those who try to speak out against their oppression. Instead, we should make sure that we foreground what our goals are in the production of critique, not the legitimacy of our personal origins <br />

Their representation of the border romanticizes the good subject on the border, creating a utopian political position from whence resistance is always good, and should always be affirmed—this elides the complexities of power and produces new forms of domination <br />
